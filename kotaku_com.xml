They also said that Sony will continue to make both single-player and multiplayer games. <em>Bloomberg</em> reporter Jason Schreier <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://bsky.app/profile/jasonschreier.bsky.social/post/3lfvfm2febc2e&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://bsky.app/profile/jasonschreier.bsky.social/post/3lfvfm2febc2e" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">confirmed on social media</a></span> that the canceled Bluepoint project was a live service <em>God of War</em> spin-off. </p><p>Bend Studio is best known for <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/days-gone-the-kotaku-review-1834287975&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/days-gone-the-kotaku-review-1834287975">the open-world zombie shooter <em>Days Gone</em></a></span>, while Bluepoint, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/sony-is-buying-the-remaster-powerhouse-behind-all-those-1847774799&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/sony-is-buying-the-remaster-powerhouse-behind-all-those-1847774799">acquired by Sony as recently as 2021</a></span>, was responsible for the recent well-received PS5 remake of <em>Demon’s Souls</em>. While neither project was officially announced, previous leaks suggested Bend was working on a multiplayer game with a military shooter aesthetic. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://mp1st.com/news/report-sony-bend-new-ip-in-development-screenshots-surface&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://mp1st.com/news/report-sony-bend-new-ip-in-development-screenshots-surface" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Alleged images</a></span> from the game appeared online last month before being taken down by Sony via a DMCA notice. Prior to <em>Days Gone</em>, Bend was best known for the espionage shooter series <em>Syphon Filter</em>. </p><p>The cancelation of Bluepoint’s <em>God of War</em> spin-off, meanwhile, would make it the second high-profile live-service project based on a major PlayStation franchise to be killed in recent years. Back in 2023, Sony also <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/last-us-online-factions-multiplayer-ps5-naughty-dog-1851101434&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/last-us-online-factions-multiplayer-ps5-naughty-dog-1851101434">shutdown a highly-anticipated <em>Last Of Us </em>multiplayer game called <em>Last of Us Online</em></a></span>. Naughty Dog claimed at the time that the decision not to move forward with the project was because the studio didn’t want to become solely obsessed with maintaining a live-service game, as arguably happened with Bungie in recent years. </p><p>Back in 2023, then-PlayStation CEO Jim Ryan <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/playstation-live-service-delayed-tlou-factions-1851007495&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/playstation-live-service-delayed-tlou-factions-1851007495">promised 12 live-service games by 2025</a></span>. Over Half of those have now been reportedly canceled or, in the case of <em>Concord</em>, un-released. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/firewalk-studios-concord-ps5-sony-live-service-shutdown-1851684290&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/firewalk-studios-concord-ps5-sony-live-service-shutdown-1851684290">The over-$200 million flop</a></span> has seemingly been part of a major internal re-evaluation of Sony’s multiplayer development strategy. While <em>Helldivers 2</em> turned out to be one of last year’s biggest surprise hits, the live-service push has so far yielded many more failures than success stories. </p><p>For now, multiplayer spin-offs of the sci-fi open-world action series <em>Horizon Zero Dawn</em> appear some of the few left standing within Sony’s first-party portfolio, which is currently led by the former head of the studio that made the series, Hermen Hulst. A <em>Monster Hunter-</em>style multiplayer <em>Horizon </em>spin-off and a possible MMO are both believed to currently be in production, and potentially nearing release in the next year or two. </p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Well, the feature is finally coming to the hit mobile adaptation later this month, and the developers have revealed how that system will actually work in practice. Will you be able to instantly trade for all the cards missing from your collection? Not quite.</p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="196165" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="What’s Coming Out Beyond Pokémon: The Indigo Disk | The Week In Games" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="95" data-playlist="196165,194907,194141" data-current="196165"><div><p>What’s Coming Out Beyond Pokémon: The Indigo Disk | The Week In Games</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196165/196165_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196165/196165_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196165/196165_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196165/196165_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/21711.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>When <em>Pokémon TCG Pocket</em> implements trading later this month it will come with plenty of strict rules limiting precisely how and when players can exchange cards from their collections. It will also restrict them from sharing the rarest cards. Only one-star cards and below will be tradeable. Two-star, three-star, and crown cards, like the gold Charizard Ex, will all be locked to their existing owners’ accounts. </p><p>Here’s the full list of <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://x.com/PokemonTCGP/status/1880012156504084895&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://x.com/PokemonTCGP/status/1880012156504084895" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">rules previewed</a></span> by <em>Pokémon TCG Pocket</em>’s developers at Creatures, Inc. and DeNA:</p><blockquote data-type="BlockQuote"><ul data-type="List" data-style="Bullet"><li>Trades can be done between friends.</li><li>Trades can be done with cards of the same rarity.</li><li> At the time of the trade feature’s launch, certain cards from the Genetic Apex and Mythical Island booster packs will be able to be traded. We are planning to continue to expand the selection of booster packs that you can trade from. </li><li>Cards with a rarity of 1-4 diamond and 1-star can be traded</li><li>Items must be consumed in order to trade.</li></ul></blockquote><p>So basically, trading in <em>Pokémon TCG Pocket</em> will have a currency-limited cooldown and it will only be for older booster pack collections. The team has already confirmed the next set of booster packs beyond Genetic Apex and Mythical Island will go live by the end of January. That suggests that at least for now, the plan is for trading to only be available for “older” sets, presumably the ones where hardcore players have already maxed out most of their library and are just chasing a final handful of cards that still haven’t come up in packs for them.</p><p>As you can imagine, this hasn’t gone over well with <em>Pokémon TCG Pocket</em>’s most diehard fans. “So was the point on having all of these copies if I can’t trade for the ones I need?” responded one player. “I have all the sub 1* cards for both sets. I don’t need to trade for them,” responded another. “I need to trade my high end dupes for others high end cards.” </p><p>Well known <em>Pokémon </em>YouTuber Austin John Plays also weighed in. “Pulling 3 of the same 2-star while missing several others and not being able to trade them is just soul crushing,” he wrote. “If you’re keeping same rarity, then allow all rarities. Please.” He has a point. If the game is already limiting players to like-for-like swaps, the trading pool will already be severely limited. Locking the rarest cards which have a 0.16 percent pull rate seems to go way overboard. </p><p>It’s possible the initial wave of negative feedback could convince the game’s makers to change their minds. “Your concerns are seen,” <em>Pokémon TCG Pocket</em>’s devs responded. “Once this feature becomes available, I’d like to invite everyone to try it and provide feedback. This way, the game can continue to evolve in an enjoyable way for everyone.” Time will tell if that ends up being the case. One estimate already puts the revenue earned from the mobile game <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.pocketgamer.biz/pokemon-trading-card-game-pocket-smashes-400-million-in-10-weeks/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.pocketgamer.biz/pokemon-trading-card-game-pocket-smashes-400-million-in-10-weeks/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">at $400 million</a></span>. </p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
