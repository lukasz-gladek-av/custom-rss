            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              
              <p>The overwhelming consensus among the first hands-on demos with <em>Borderlands 4</em> earlier this summer was that <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/fps/borderlands-4-hands-on-preview/">it’s more of the same</a>. If you already like <em>Borderlands</em>, the sequel is likely to provide everything fans usually show up for. If not, well, TBD on how many nonbelievers Gearbox Entertainment manages to win over with its most ambitious looter shooter yet. Much of that will come down to the details, and the studio has been sharing a lot of them recently. Here’s a bunch of stuff we learned <a href="https://kotaku.com/borderlands-4-price-tag-70-drama-pitchford-80-real-fan-1851784583">about <em>Borderlands 4</em> this week</a>.</p> <h2>Split-screen co-op returns</h2> <p>Senior project producer Anthony Nicholson<a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2025/08/12/how-borderlands-4-built-for-co-op-ground-up/"> wrote on Xbox Wire this week</a> that in addition to supporting local co-op, <em>Borderlands 4</em> will also let you play with another pair of people in split-screen mode. Two TVs, four-player sessions, tons of chaos. Teaming up has also apparently been streamlined with a better lobby system and improved dynamic level scaling, including the option for each player to set their own difficulty.</p> <h2>Switch 2 won’t have couch co-op</h2> <p>“Switch 2 players will have the same exciting <em>Borderlands 4</em> experience as other platforms minus the split-screen option, and yes, it will have full cross-play with Epic, Steam, PlayStation 5, and Xbox X|S,” reads <a href="https://support.borderlands.com/hc/en-us/articles/43481582561939-Borderlands-4-Nintendo-Switch-2-FAQ#h_01K1XYNFY9RTPMT184WZ70D421">the Nintendo version’s support page</a>. The port targets 30fps and arrives on October 3, roughly three weeks after the platforms.</p>

 <h2>There are over 30 billion guns</h2> <p>Yes, that’s a real stat Gearbox is pushing. One of the reasons for that big number is that <em>Borderlands 4</em> lets you mix-and-match elements from different in-universe weapons manufacturers. Then there are all of the RNG stat and perk drops you can get. According to Nicholson, the studio created a Matrix-like gun rack to help conceptualize all the possibilities and prevent the game from spitting out combinations that wouldn’t work.</p> <p>“It was this really large gun map where you could see all of the individual parts for all the individual guns, for all the individual manufacturers,” he <a href="https://store.epicgames.com/en-US/news/borderlands-randy-pitchford-interview-borderlands-4">told the Epic Games Store blog</a>. “It made it so you could see how each of those things were and how we could have those combinations roll together and how they would work—the slides, the animators, the actions, the art all fitting together. Because a certain gun, if it pumps one way, but there’s a long barrel that goes on the bottom, obviously those parts can’t go together.”</p> <h2><em>Borderlands 4</em> has “more passive perks than all the previous <em>Borderlands</em> combined”</h2> <p>Size matters, at least for <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Borderlands4/comments/1lh1qm0/borderlands_4_long_info_dump_compiled_from_32/">Gearbox’s marketing guys</a>. The <em>Borderlands 4</em> map is bigger than the last two numbered entries combined. The guns have four times as many polygons as <em>Borderlands 3</em>. All those billions of guns. You get the idea. The skill tree follows a similar pattern. It sounds more advanced, and potentially overwhelming, than any game prior—more <em>Diablo 4</em> or<em> Path of Exile</em> than your traditional RPG shooter.</p>

 <p>“The Augment and the Capstone system that we have forces you to make a choice and all of them drastically change the ability that each player has,” character designer Nick Thurston <a href="https://www.polygon.com/borderlands-4-passive-perks-interview-gearbox/">told <em>Polygon</em></a>. “That <em>alone&nbsp;</em>would create more build diversity than we’ve ever had. But then we also have more passives than all the previous Borderlands combined. I think Amon alone has 87 passives, and most Vault Hunters have about 80.”</p> <h2>Techno Viking Amon is<em> Borderland</em>‘s “most complicated” Vault Hunter yet</h2> <p>Amon is the guy with the big fire and ice axes you see in all the <em>Borderlands 4</em> trailers. But looks can be deceiving. He’s not just a tanky melee character. He’s apparently the poster child for the new game’s build variety. Everyone in a squad could play as Amon, but the styles might all be different, Gearbox claims. Melee, ranged, support, he can do it all. Unlike most of the franchise’s Vault Hunters that pop abilities and then just shoot stuff, Amon’s skills can be deployed in more ways.</p>

 <p>“He just has more abilities than any other Vault Hunter numerically because of his trait, which allows him to have forge skills,” Thurston <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/borderlands-4s-amon-is-a-more-complicated-vault-hunter-to-play-than-past-options/1100-6533956/">told <em>GameSpot</em></a>. “I wouldn’t say he’s super complicated, but he has a lot more going on in the middle of combat, and he’s a lot more active than I think a lot of people historically expect from Vault Hunters.” He sounds like a more advanced archetype than some of the others, though Gearbox says he’s still approachable to new players.</p> <h2><em>Borderlands 4</em> is inspired by mergers, acquisitions, and fascism</h2> <p>The game takes place on a prison planet called Kairos. Gearbox CEO Randy Pitchford suggests that’s a not-so-subtle illusion to the studio’s rocky period during which it was sold to the <a href="https://kotaku.com/borderlands-4-gearbox-embracer-acquisition-1851297286">poorly conceived Embracer holding company</a>, before trying to escape again. The studio group is now owned by longtime publishing partner 2K Games, part of the broader Take-Two portfolio that includes <em>Grand Theft Auto VI</em> maker Rockstar Games and mobile maker Zynga.</p> <p>“There’s this cultural and emotional shift in me, personally, and at the studio. What does it mean to trade some autonomy for organization?” he told <a href="https://store.epicgames.com/en-US/news/borderlands-randy-pitchford-interview-borderlands-4">the Epic Games Store blog</a>: “What does it feel like to move up and down the scale between autonomy and being organized or even being controlled? On one end of a spectrum you have anarchy, and on the other end of the spectrum you have fascism, totalitarianism, zero freedom. It’s not just about societies—that’s all of us as individuals, to imagine where we want to be on that spectrum and how comfortable we are. And we were going through that as a company.”</p>

              <p><span>This weekend is a big one for fans and players of competitive </span><i><span>Pokémon</span></i><span>. Thousands of fans are gathering in the Anaheim Convention Center to watch the best of the best battle each other in </span><i><span>Scarlet </span></i><span>and </span><i><span>Violet</span></i><span>. However, not everyone is there to have a good time. For some people, the cost of attendance is merely a business expense. Like </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/mcdonalds-pokemon-scalpers-happy-meal-toys-japan-2000617978"><span>every other </span><i><span>Pokémon </span></i><span>event or collaboration</span></a><span> in recent memory, </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-scalper-reseller-trading-card-van-gogh-pikachu-1850925900"><span>scalpers</span></a><span> have </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-world-championship-merchandise-scalper-reseller-2000617744"><span>descended upon Anaheim</span></a><span> to buy up exclusive </span><i><span>Pokémon</span></i><span> merch and then sell it for a profit. I really wanted to go to Worlds this year, as I’ve been a </span><i><span>Pokémon </span></i><span>fan most of my life and still haven’t been to one of the championship competitions, but while the tournament is just beginning, the vibes seem so rancid I’m not sure it would make for a great first impression.</span></p> <p><span>It seems like every other week we here at </span><i><span>Kotaku </span></i><span>are writing about some absolute nonsense in the </span><i><span>Pokémon </span></i><span>community, as scalpers have made full-time jobs out of buying up cards and collectibles for a quick buck. The controversial practice has become so lucrative for these grown-ass adults that sales devolve into </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-adults-men-fighting-over-restock-machine-tiktok-1851768074"><span>actual acts of violence</span></a><span> or crowds end up </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-van-gogh-museum-scalpers-pikachu-card-1850882131"><span>jockeying to rummage through shelves</span></a><span> like it’s Black Friday. Part of me feels some sympathy for people who have to resort to this because times are tough and it’s easier than hard labor, but especially considering this franchise has probably brought me more joy than any other for most of my life, it really sucks to see that every new event or merch drop now makes me feel so deeply cynical.</span></p> <p><span>The Anaheim event has only been going on for a day, and there are already </span><a href="https://x.com/michmalllow/status/1956092730708516956"><span>reports of resellers setting up shop in neighboring hotels</span></a><span> near the convention center, with others responding by putting up signage </span><a href="https://x.com/predaconspittor/status/1956151255124029911"><span>prohibiting such wheeling and dealing</span></a><span>. Competitive players are </span><a href="https://x.com/NicholasMoffit2/status/1956059599569916167"><span>posting on social media</span></a><span> about selling merchandise for more than they paid for it. What is supposed to be a giant community gathering has become something else entirely, and it’s made it harder to be a fan when you can’t even engage with it without having to push through people with bad intentions.</span></p>

 <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">I really really dislike how pokemon worlds has turned from a celebration of competitive pokemon to taking anything remotely valuable and scalping it for a profit.</p> <p>— Tyson Blätter (@T_Blatt) <a href="https://twitter.com/T_Blatt/status/1956007686190866633?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">August 14, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">Worlds Pokemon Center showing us once again that capitalism ruins everything people love 🙂</p> <p>— Sawyer Melban (@sawyerhatemail) <a href="https://twitter.com/sawyerhatemail/status/1955874877724090578?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">August 14, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">I don’t understand why some people are complaining that we brought our daughter to the Pokemon Center yesterday. This is literally a family game.

So it begs the question: Is </span><i><span>Pokémon </span></i><span>just cooked as a hobby now? After nearly 30 years, has the franchise’s reputation become so sullied by people who buy its merchandise just to sell it to other people that longtime devotees are leaving it behind? The </span><i><span>Pokémon </span></i><span>franchise is too far-reaching to really be affected by this phenomenon, which a lot of collectors believe is why The Pokémon Company doesn’t do much to really stop it. Purchase limits on new merchandise are helpful, but they don’t stop scalpers from showing up before stores put cards on the shelf, making multiple accounts to purchase items online, or causing a ruckus at events like Worlds. </span></p> <p><span>You would think constantly being in the headlines for robberies, chaotic sales, and even actual violence associated with your product would be damaging enough to the brand that TPC would be motivated to take real action. But again, </span><i><span>Pokémon </span></i><span>is so prolific that TPC doesn’t actually receive any chip damage from this. A sale to a scalper puts the same amount of money in Pikachu’s pockets as one to a devoted fan. The assembly line will keep going, and unless people stop buying from them, scalpers will keep showing up. As I said earlier, </span><i><span>Pokémon </span></i><span>has brought me more joy than probably any other series. These days, however, that joy is getting drowned out by cynicism every time some event takes place that should be reminding me why I fell in love with </span><i><span>Pokémon </span></i><span>in the first place.</span></p>
