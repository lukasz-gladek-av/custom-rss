              <p>Some gaming monitors get touted as being “ultra-wide” but this one really earns that namesake. The Samsung Odyssey Neo G9 gaming monitor stretches an intimidating 57″ across. If you’re in the market for a monitor that is just one step shy of spanning 360 degrees around you’re head while you play, well, this might be exactly what you’re looking for. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6278/">Amazon has the Samsung monitor listed right now for a staggering $850 off. That brings it to $1,450—about 37% off its original price.</a></p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6278/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2 data-start="772" data-end="826">Performance That Extends Beyond Your Field of View</h2>
<p data-start="828" data-end="1339">Samsung proudly markets the Odyssey Neo G9 as the world’s first dual UHD gaming monitor. The screen is essentially the equivalent of two 32-inch 4K displays fused side by side, creating an ultra-wide canvas that delivers incredible clarity across an almost unfathomably wide viewing area. Thanks to Quantum Mini-LED technology paired with HDR 1000 support, the monitor reaches stunning levels of brightness, contrast, and color accuracy that make games and visuals feel strikingly lifelike.</p>
<p data-start="1341" data-end="1683">Speed is just as impressive as image quality. With an ultra-smooth 240Hz refresh rate and full support for AMD FreeSync Premium Pro, the Odyssey Neo G9 minimizes screen tearing, stuttering, and frame drops. As long as your gaming PC has the horsepower to keep up, you can expect fluid motion and responsive gameplay across the entire display.</p>
<p data-start="1685" data-end="2071">The screen’s aggressive 1000R curvature is designed to match the natural curvature of the human eye, making the monitor feel as though it’s wrapping around you. When positioned at the proper viewing distance, the display stretches from the far edges of your left peripheral vision all the way across to the right, creating an incredibly immersive experience that few monitors can rival.</p>


<p data-start="2073" data-end="2353">For connectivity, Samsung includes the latest DisplayPort 2.1, ensuring access to the some of the highest bandwidth and best performance available today. The monitor also supports HDMI 2.1 and features a USB-C hub, giving you plenty of options for connecting PCs, consoles, and other devices.</p>
<p data-start="2355" data-end="2742">Because of its immense width, the Odyssey Neo G9 excels at multitasking. Picture-by-picture mode allows you to display content from two different input sources simultaneously at their native resolutions. Samsung’s Auto Source Switch+ further can automatically detect newly powered-on devices and switching to the correct input without requiring any manual adjustments.</p>
<p data-start="2744" data-end="3034">On the back of the monitor, CoreSync and Core Lighting+ add some extra flair by matching ambient RGB lighting to the colors displayed on screen. If the ultra-wide monitor doesn’t capture you’re entire vision, the area around it will be illuminated to feel as though the screen extends even further than the absurd lengths it already does.</p>
<p data-start="3036" data-end="3400" data-is-last-node="" data-is-only-node="">The monitor sits on a highly flexible, ergonomic stand that supports swivel, tilt, and height adjustments. It’s easy to dial in the perfect viewing position for any desk or user.</p>

              <p>Looking to finally invest in a Nintendo Switch? Now’s the time to lock one in, especially now that the holidays are here. Whether you like sitting on the couch, taking gaming on the go, or playing with friends at a get together, the Switch OLED version is a great console to bring home. It’s now the more affordable cousin of the Switch 2, and it’s available at an even lower price than usual.</p>

<h2>One of Nintendo’s best portable gaming consoles</h2>

<p>Even though this unit is renewed, it still gives you the full Nintendo Switch experience. You can dock it to play on a TV just like a brand new model, or you can use it in handheld mode when you want gaming freedom without being tied to a screen in your living room. The joy con controllers are easy to detach for multiplayer games at a party or a family game night. You can also use the touch screen for compatible titles, which adds another layer of interaction.</p>



<p>The renewed model goes through inspection to make sure it works properly, which means you get the same game library and capabilities without paying full retail price. There may be a few cosmetic imperfections, but you’ll mostly be getting a blemish-free unit that’s been guaranteed to work.</p>
<p>With a huge library of games from all kinds of genres, the Switch is great for kids, teens, and adults who like variety in their play. From racing to role playing to fitness and rhythm games, there is stuff here for nearly everyone. It has become a go to portable console because it stays fun and fresh with new titles releasing regularly.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6170/">For just $308, down from $385, the Nintendo Switch OLED Model w/ Joy-Con (Renewed) gives you plenty of value with a ton of ways to play.</a> Whether you’re giving it as a gift or keeping it for yourself, it’s a good idea to go ahead and lock yours in.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/apple-goes-to-record-low-on-airpods-pro-3-via-amazon-now-cheaper-than-your-old-pro-2-2000654722</link>

              <p>Apple’s pricing strategy since Black Friday has been wild to watch with the AirPods Pro 3 dropping roughly $10 each week like clockwork. Yesterday <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4214/">they were sitting at $209, and today they’ve hit $199, marking an all-time low</a> that you won’t find on Apple’s official site where they’re still listed at the full $249. <strong>Amazon’s exclusively offering this discount</strong> and makes it the perfect moment to grab wireless earbuds that pack hearing aid features, live translation, and heart rate sensing.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4214/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Why These Earbuds Are Worth the Hype</h2>
<p>Active noise cancellation <strong>cuts out up to twice as much unwanted nois</strong>e as the AirPods Pro 2 and makes a bubble of silence that works just as well on subway rides as it does in open offices where coworkers won’t stop talking. The new acoustic architecture changes how music sounds to your ears, the bass feels deeper without making the midrange sound muddy, and the clarity lets you hear each instrument in complex tracks. <strong>Vocals are so clear that it sounds like the host is talking directly to you in podcasts</strong> and audiobooks. Last but not least, <strong>spatial audio makes the soundstage three-dimensional</strong> and moves with your head.</p>



<p>Heart rate sensing lets you track your fitness right from your earbuds, keeping track of your pulse and calories burned during up to 50 different types of workouts without needing to wear an Apple Watch. You can use the Move ring, count your steps, and Workout Buddy, which is powered by Apple Intelligence and learns your habits and pushes you when you’re not working hard enough.<strong> Live Translation makes it possible to talk to people who speak different languages</strong> in real time and Apple Intelligence does all the hard work in the background: This one feature changes how you can travel and talk to friends and clients from other countries.</p>
<p>With ANC on, the battery lasts up to 8 hours on a single charge and with Transparency mode and the Hearing Aid feature on, the battery lasts up to 10 hours. The <strong>USB-C charging case lets you listen for more than 24 hours</strong> before you need to find an outlet. If you plug it in for just five minutes, it will charge quickly and give you about an hour of playback time<strong>. With five different ear tip sizes</strong>, you can finally find a fit that stays in place while you run or just listen to music.</p>



<p>The hearing health features are more advanced than what you’d find in regular earbuds and you can take a clinical-grade hearing test at home using guided tones and frequency sweeps. The Hearing Aid feature with automatic Conversation Boost makes voices louder in noisy places, so you can follow conversations at restaurants or family gatherings without having to ask people to repeat themselves all the time.</p>
<p><strong>Bluetooth connections</strong> stay strong even in crowded places where wireless signals usually have trouble: Your iPhone, iPad, and Mac will automatically switch between them based on which one you’re using at the time. You can control playback, answer calls, and switch between noise cancellation modes on each earbud stem without having to look for your phone. With spatial audio and dynamic head tracking, movies and TV shows sound like they are coming from a personal surround sound system, and the sound moves naturally as you turn your head.</p>
<p>Right now, you can get Apple’s best earbuds for $199 instead of $249 which is the lowest price ever on Amazon. This is a great deal for features that used to only be found in medical devices and high-end headphones. With better noise cancellation, heart rate tracking, live translation, and real hearing aid features, you get tools that make your daily life better than just listening to music.</p>
