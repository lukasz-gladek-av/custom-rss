Specifically, more costumes, accessories, and other ways to customize their iconic <em>DBZ</em> fighters’ looks, including with shirts and jackets that pull from deep cuts within the long-running anime’s history. </p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="195502" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="The Most Sought After Elden Ring Sword Has A Storied History" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="307" data-playlist="195502,195624,196578" data-current="195502"><div><p>The Most Sought After Elden Ring Sword Has A Storied History</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195502/195502_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195502/195502_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195502/195502_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195502/195502_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/20979.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>One of the most requested outfits is Goku’s pre-Cell Games track jacket that he wears in his off time leading up to the tournament. Another is Piccolo’s yellow “Postboy” shirt he wears in the Trunks Saga filler episode in which he and Goku try to get their driver’s licenses. The streetwear fits aren’t just fan favorites, they also showcase more casual sides of the characters and express a range of personality outside the standard battle outfits.</p><p>The <em>Dragon Ball: Sparking Zero </em>subreddit has had fans <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/SparkingZero/comments/1geub3z/i_feel_a_bit_lied_to/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/SparkingZero/comments/1geub3z/i_feel_a_bit_lied_to/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">frequently scratching their heads</a></span> at why a game that’s bursting with fan service in other areas is missing these key costumes. Some are worried that it simply means Bandai Namco is planning to dole out each new style over months and years through a relentless drip-feed of microtransaction add-ons as it’s done with <em>Dragon Ball Xenoverse 2</em>. <em>Sparking</em>&nbsp;<em>Zero </em>seems destined to be the ultimate <em>DBZ</em> sim, but no <em>DBZ</em> sim is complete without more robust dress-up options. </p><p>Enter modders who are at least bringing some of these costume changes to the PC version of the game. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://gamebanana.com/mods/551869&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://gamebanana.com/mods/551869" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">A Piccolo Postboy outfit</a></span> was added to the GameBanana mod repository yesterday. There’s also a mod for <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.nexusmods.com/dragonballsparkingzero/mods/225&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.nexusmods.com/dragonballsparkingzero/mods/225" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Vegeta’s pink “Badman” button-up</a></span> at NexusMods. Of course, there are plenty of other outfits still missing, like Goku and Vegeta’s “SAB” winter jackets from the <em>Dragon Ball Super: Broly </em>movie and Gohan’s Kai outfit from the Buu Saga. </p><p>I can forgive some of these missing from the game at launch, but too many of the best alternate costumes seem MIA at the moment. I’m not above paying for them all if they get rolled out later. It would have felt more satisfying if they were all late-game unlockables, though. </p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
