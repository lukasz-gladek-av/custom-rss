              <p>A British trade union group is accusing Rockstar Games of union busting after it reportedly fired over 30 employees across offices in the UK and Canada. The <a href="https://kotaku.com/gta-6-vi-new-trailer-destiny-renegades-clair-obscur-1851779967"><em>Grand Theft Auto 6</em> maker</a> denies the charges, however, claiming the people were terminated for “gross misconduct.”</p> <p>“Rockstar has just carried out one of the most blatant and ruthless acts of union busting in the history of the games industry,” Independent Workers’ Union of Great Britain (IWGB) president Alex Marshall said in a statement, first reported <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-10-31/-grand-theft-auto-studio-accused-of-union-busting-after-firings?accessToken=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJzb3VyY2UiOiJTdWJzY3JpYmVyR2lmdGVkQXJ0aWNsZSIsImlhdCI6MTc2MTkzOTg3MSwiZXhwIjoxNzYyNTQ0NjcxLCJhcnRpY2xlSWQiOiJUNTBISEpHUFFRNkMwMCIsImJjb25uZWN0SWQiOiJCMUVBQkI5NjQ2QUM0REZFQTJBRkI4MjI1MzgyQTJFQSJ9.9NYooKXrBMU_quRYMOSw6uACDogcIuS-E27t4GD8f2g">by <em>Bloomberg</em></a>. “This flagrant contempt for the law and for the lives of the workers who bring in their billions is an insult to their fans and the global industry.”</p>

 <p>But Rockstar parent company Take-Two claims that’s not the case. “We strive to make the world’s best entertainment properties by giving our best-in-class creative teams positive work environments and ongoing career opportunities,” a spokesperson for the company said in an email to&nbsp;<em>Kotaku</em>. “Our culture is focused on teamwork, excellence, and kindness. Rockstar Games terminated a small number of individuals for gross misconduct, and for no other reason. As always, we fully support Rockstar’s ambitions and approach.”</p>

 <p>According to Marshall, the only people fired from Rockstar were all members of a private trade union chat group on Discord who had either signed up for IWGB membership or were thinking of doing so. While the studio is made up of thousands of employees and headquartered in New York, the biggest office is Rockstar North located in Edinburgh, Scotland.</p> <p>Best known for the <em>Grand Theft Auto</em> and <em>Red Dead Redemption</em> franchises, the studio is currently working to ship <em>GTA 6</em> after its 2025 launch was <a href="https://kotaku.com/gta-6-delay-may-2026-too-many-games-rockstar-trailer-2-1851778860">delayed earlier this year</a>. It’s now set to arrive in May 2026. While Rockstar Games had <a href="https://kotaku.com/inside-rockstar-games-culture-of-crunch-1829936466">a notorious history of crunching during development</a>, the company has <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-07-27/gta-6-release-date-rockstar-cleans-up-image-after-employee-backlash">reportedly made big strides</a> in recent years in improving its work culture. A controversial return-to-office policy, however, <a href="https://kotaku.com/grand-theft-auto-6-gta-rockstar-games-return-office-1851297508">showed there are still tensions</a> between developers and management at the studio.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/free-horror-games-halloween-bundle-cheap-discount-2000640518</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/mouthwashing-bundle-features-13-great-horror-games-for-just-13.1340782/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Humble Bundle deals can be hard to beat and the latest is no exception. The Indie Fears bundle features over a dozen games for less than $20, including some instant classics like last year’s <a href="https://kotaku.com/mouthwashing-steam-pc-indie-psychological-horror-1851690195"><em>Mouthwashing</em></a> and the more often <a href="https://x.com/PATALOON/status/1950454460225872347">overlooked <em>Threshold</em></a>.</p> <p><a href="https://www.humblebundle.com/games/indie-fears-bundle?hmb_source=&amp;hmb_medium=product_tile&amp;hmb_campaign=mosaic_section_1_layout_index_1_layout_type_threes_tile_index_1_c_indiefearsbundle_bundle">Pay at least $13</a> (or more if you want to donate something extra to the Special Effect charity for helping gamers with disabilities) and you’ll unlock PC codes for 13 games. In addition to the sci-fi mystery about crewmates stranded in space and the atmospheric horror game about an attendant at a train station in the mountains, the bundle also gets you <em>Buckshot Roulette</em>, <em>Arctic Eggs</em>, <em>Who’s Lila?</em>, <em>Order 13</em>, <em>No-Skin</em>, <em>Kiosk</em>, <em>Adios</em>, <em>The Boba Teashop</em>, <em>Daemonologie</em>, <em>Massacre at the Mirage</em>, and <em>Terror at Oakheart</em>.</p>

 <p>All of these games are highly rated on Steam, but I can personally vouch for<em> Buckshot Roulette</em> and <em>Arctic Eggs</em>, a surreal physics sim about cooking food for your fellow dissidents at a mysterious military prison. In addition to being cheap, these indie games don’t require a hulked-out PC to play them. If you have a laptop that came out in the last decade, you can probably play them just fine.</p>

 <h2>Four free games to try this Halloween</h2> <p>Okay, if $1 a piece wasn’t cheap enough for you, there are also some free horror games out there just waiting to be claimed. <a href="https://kotaku.com/stasis-shows-how-spooky-a-point-and-click-adventure-can-1728333738">First up is <em>Stasis</em></a>, a 2015 point-and-click isometric adventure about emerging from a pod during a mysterious space voyage and figuring out what the hell is going on. &nbsp;“The game’s atmosphere is thick with tension, but it’s not trying to make you sweat the whole time, so the few moments it breaks things up and hits you with something shocking, it really works,” reads our <a href="https://kotaku.com/stasis-shows-how-spooky-a-point-and-click-adventure-can-1728333738">original review</a>. GOG is currently giving away the standard edition DRM-free for $0.00 <a href="https://www.gog.com/en/game/stasis?cjdata=MXxOfDB8WXww&amp;utm_campaign=cj&amp;utm_medium=affiliate&amp;utm_source=cj&amp;r=true">through November 2</a>.</p>

 <p>The Epic Games Store is also giving out <a href="https://store.epicgames.com/en-US/free-games">some Halloween freebies</a>. There’s <em>Bendy and the Ink Machine</em>, the first-person horror puzzle game in the style of old-time cartoons. Put up with its sometimes monotonous point-and-click problem solving and you’ll be rewarded with some neat storytelling.&nbsp;<em>Five Nights At Freddy’s: Into the Pit</em> is also free to claim right now. It takes the usual formula and turns it into a 2D pixel art adventure. Is it the best <em>FNaF</em> game? No. But it’s the cheapest.</p> <p>Finally, We Create Stuff, the team behind the acclaimed 2021 psychological horror puzzle game<em> In Sound Mind</em>, recently released a free game called <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3593490/Days_Without_Incident/"><em>Days Without Incident</em></a><em>.</em> It’s free to download and play and it’s getting some decent early Steam reviews. “This game has the same feeling as something Markiplier would have played back in the 2010s,” wrote one player. “It just oozes with old that school indie charm without relying on jump scares and loud noises every couple feet. Its definitely worth an hour of your time.”</p> <p>Sounds like a great way to spend a night pigging out <a href="https://kotaku.com/halloween-candy-price-inflation-trump-tariff-snap-2000640156">on overpriced candy</a>.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/netflix-witcher-season-4-reviews-liam-hemsworth-2000640506</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/reviews-for-netflix%E2%80%99s-witcher-season-4-are-pretty-bad.1340728/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>There has been a Witcher-sized hole in my heart for several years now. Unfortunately, the return of <a href="https://kotaku.com/netflix-witcher-season-4-liam-hemsworth-henry-cavil-1851493745">Netflix’s live-action adaptation</a> is unlikely to help fill it. <em>The Witcher</em> season 4 is finally out and bingeable on the streaming service, and almost no one seems to be happy about it.</p> <p>Liam Hemsworth has debuted as the grizzled monster hunter Geralt of Rivia. Netflix even went ahead and retconned him into old scenes for the recap. Does the <em>Hunger Games</em> star earn his keep after all the <a href="https://kotaku.com/liam-hemsworth-witcher-henry-cavill-geralt-netflix-battlefield-6-2000633232">drama surrounding Henry Cavill’s seemingly tumultuous exit</a>? Doesn’t sound like it. One of the most glowing things early watchers have to say about Hemsworth is that, while he ain’t great, he’s at least not the worst thing about season 4.</p>

 <p>It’s everything else that’s apparently a weird mess. The new episodes, which started streaming on October 30, pick up with a recovering Geralt searching a war-torn countryside for surrogate daughter Ciri who is trying out life with a group of bandits while the mage Yennefer rallies others to her campaign to take down the rogue member of the member of the&nbsp;Brotherhood of Sorcerers named Vilgefortz.</p>

 <p>The show was trending in the wrong direction even during its bumpy season 3, which was awkwardly split in half, thus I’m not entirely surprised that season 4 is the Netflix adaptation’s most poorly reviewed yet. It’s currently sitting at a positive rating of just 58 percent <a href="https://www.rottentomatoes.com/tv/the_witcher/s04">on Rotten Tomatoes</a>. Fan sentiment is even worse, with a user rating in the teens. “The problem isn’t that the show has a new lead actor; it’s that it continues to be a bloated mess,” writes Andrew Webster <a href="https://www.theverge.com/entertainment/810151/the-witcher-season-4-review-netflix-liam-hemsworth">at<em> The Verge</em></a>. “No amount of imaginative swordplay or inventive creature design can prevent the sense that The <em>Witcher</em> is now what all sword and sorcery epics fear becoming: pure bilge,” wrote Nick Hilton <a href="https://www.the-independent.com/arts-entertainment/tv/reviews/the-witcher-season-4-netflix-liam-hemsworth-review-b2854691.html">at <em>The Independent</em></a>.</p>

 <p>The problems go beyond Hemsworth, though. “The tone remains wildly uneven, lurching as it does between steeple-fingered <em>Game of Thrones</em>-y glumness and those early-90s Saturday afternoon series in which an uncommunicative hunk wanders between small communities, rescuing imperiled innocents from baddies while learning about the true meaning of friendship,” wrote Sarah Dempster <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2025/oct/30/the-witcher-season-four-review-liam-hemsworth-replaces-henry-cavill-review">at <em>The Guardian</em></a>. Solving that contradiction was what<em> The Witcher 3</em> video game did so well, and what the show has failed at more and more with each successive season.</p>

 <p>Not everyone’s so down on <em>The Witcher</em>‘s return. <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/netflix-the-witcher-season-4-review-liam-hemsworth"><em>IGN</em></a>‘s Matt Fowler called it “incomplete” but congratulated it on “more successes than missteps,” while <a href="https://www.pastemagazine.com/tv/netflix/the-witcher-season-4-review"><em>Paste Magazine</em></a>‘s Lacy Baugher called it “wildly satisfying” as a spin-off about the tormented mage Yennefer, played by the excellent Anya Chalotra. But many fans aren’t having it. “Don’t mind Hemsworth as Geralt,” <a href="https://www.rottentomatoes.com/tv/the_witcher/s04/reviews?type=user">conceded</a> one Rotten Tomatoes user. “It’s tough being second and he’s notable different to Cavill. The real issue with season 4 is the direction. It’s corndog crap. Witches on brooms, swearing birds, priests that burn children being aided by the crew of the Black Pearl, it’s just nonsense.”</p>

 <p>Beyond these eight new episodes, a season 5 is still supposedly in the works. After that? It sounds like Netflix is ready to call it. “By the time we wrap Season 5 fully, it will have been nine years of my life,” showrunner Lauren Schmidt-Hissrich <a href="https://www.dexerto.com/tv-movies/the-witcher-could-netflix-show-survive-without-geralt-henry-cavill-exit-3277462/">told <em>Dexerto</em></a>. “I think there are so many more stories to be told in <em>The Witcher</em> universe, truly.  But I also think you have to step back and accept gracefully, what is the end of this story that we’ve been telling?”</p> <p>At least by then, CD Projekt Red’s <a href="https://kotaku.com/witcher-4-ciri-trailer-gameplay-ue5-tech-demo-1851783467"><em>The Witcher 4</em></a> will probably be out. It will similarly be moving from one lead to another, focusing on Ciri instead of Geralt. Hopefully, that transition goes much smoother.</p>

              <p>The end of October is here, which means the spooky decorations are about to make way for snow, presents, and mistletoe. But before we say goodbye to the jack-o-lanterns and trick-or-treating, we can still pay tribute to the spookiest, the scariest, the ghouliest(?) of Pokémon: the ghost types.</p> <p>Over the years, ghost Pokémon have exploded in number, starting from just <a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-gastly-anime-episode-ghost-of-maidens-peak-1850892373">the Gastly line</a>, which was their sole representative in the original games, to now dozens of critters haunting the Pokémon world. Ghost-type Pokémon Pokédex entries include some of the most <a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-legends-za-horror-trailer-creepy-2000619530">terrifying lore dumps</a> in this typically all-ages series, and that’s what makes them some of the most interesting. But while we’d love to give every ghost-type friend their due, today we’ve narrowed it down to the 10 creepiest, spookiest, and most memorable lines in the first nine generations of Pokémon. That was a tough challenge, because there are some pretty remarkable ghosts in these games. But before we get to the honorees, here are the honorable mentions:</p> <ul> <li>Aegislash</li> <li>Cursola</li> <li>Dragapult</li> <li>Drifblim</li> <li>Froslass</li> <li>Galarian Marowak</li> <li>Gholdengo</li> <li>Golurk</li> <li>Hisuian Typhlosion</li> <li>Houndstone</li> <li>Mismagius</li> <li>Polteageist</li> <li>Rotom</li> <li>Skeledirge</li> </ul> <div> <p>Welcome to Exp. Share, <em>Kotaku</em> ’s <em>Pokémon</em> column in which we dive deep to explore notable characters, urban legends, communities, and just plain weird quirks from throughout the <em>Pokémon</em> franchise.</p></div>
