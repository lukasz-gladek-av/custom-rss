In the interview, he claims to have less than a million dollars in his bank account and says life was “easier” when he was broke. </p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="197298" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="Live Forever in the Universe of 'New World: Aeternum'" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="108" data-playlist="197298,197284,197260" data-current="197298"><div><p>Live Forever in the Universe of 'New World: Aeternum'</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197298/197298_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197298/197298_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197298/197298_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197298/197298_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"></video></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>Jimmy Donaldson, better known online as MrBeast, has the most subscribed-to channel on YouTube and has become famous for videos that often feature him giving away lots of money or helping people in different parts of the world.

Getting big-picture about the human condition, he added, “We were not meant to receive this kind of feedback from basically anyone, anywhere in the world.”</p><p>Elsewhere in the conversation, MrBeast claimed his job was “killing” him because he doesn’t ever stop working. “I work every hour my eyes are awake,” said the creator. </p><p>“The average person does not want to live this life…in my head just working all the time? And they would probably just ask themselves, why am I working all the time? I don’t do literally anything else.”</p><p>Making it harder for him to work, beyond the human need to sleep, is the fact that at age 15, MrBeast was diagnosed with Crohn’s Disease, he says. </p><p>“I just get sick all the time, like random rashes and things like that,” said the creator. “So it’s pretty, pretty brutal, to be honest, and then it randomly clears up sometimes and just makes you very sick, very tired. It hurts like crazy, because it gets very inflamed, and it feels like someone’s stabbing me in the gut with like a knife constantly.”</p><h2 id="h96930"><a id=""></a>MrBeast talks money, BeastGames, and being broke</h2><p>Still, despite the pain, mental health problems, and death threats, all this work has made <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/i-accidentally-ordered-burgers-from-a-youtuber-1845965201&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/i-accidentally-ordered-burgers-from-a-youtuber-1845965201">MrBeast a lot of money</a></span>, right?

Which, yeah, that’s less than I expected, though there are some really big numbers between 1 and 999,999. But while it’s clear that MrBeast has money and a lot of it, if you ask him about it, it seems like he doesn’t like being rich. </p><p>“It was like so much easier when you’re broke, if you don’t travel constantly,” said MrBeast. “Life is so easy when you just wake up in your own bed and work 15 hours compared with all this fucking bullshit where I’m like, ‘I don’t know the time zone I’m in, I don’t know what place on it’...some days I’m going to 10am, other days I’m going to 5pm.”</p><p>I’m not sure life is easier when you are poor. It really just sounds like maybe MrBeast needs to take a vacation and travel a bit less.</p><p>Speaking of money, the famous YouTuber says he lost <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/mrbeast-amazon-prime-tv-show-100-million-youtube-1851186509?_gl=1*relckg*_ga*MzQzNjkwNDM2LjE2NDY2NjQ1NzQ.*_ga_V4QNJTT5L0*MTc0MDAwMTMzMi40OTMuMS4xNzQwMDAzMjc5LjU0LjAuMA..&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/mrbeast-amazon-prime-tv-show-100-million-youtube-1851186509?_gl=1*relckg*_ga*MzQzNjkwNDM2LjE2NDY2NjQ1NzQ.*_ga_V4QNJTT5L0*MTc0MDAwMTMzMi40OTMuMS4xNzQwMDAzMjc5LjU0LjAuMA..">“tens of millions of dollars”</a></span> producing his <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/mrbeast-beast-games-amazon-prime-youtube-1851725771&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/mrbeast-beast-games-amazon-prime-youtube-1851725771">reality game show with Amazon.</a></span> Yet, he has “no regrets” about doing it, adding: “I can’t let the YouTube community down—if I fail it is over, or no streaming platforms will ever touch a creator again.”</p><p>Finally, I leave you with a statistic that seems wild and hard to believe, however also totally within the realm of possibility. MrBeast claims, based on data, that his videos sometimes reach “three percent of humans” currently alive. </p><p> .<br></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

In the suit he called Bungie’s investigation a “sham,” denied committing any fireable offenses, and suggested that Sony terminated his job as part of a ploy to deny him more than $40 million that he otherwise would have been paid due to Sony buying Bungie in 2022.

Sony’s lawyers say that these messages show a “pattern of misconduct.” The document was filed last week, according to <em>Game File. </em></p><p>In one message  Barrett asks a female Bungie employee, “Are you still in PJs?” and “[I]s it like a button down top and bottoms? Sweatpants? Lulu lemons?”</p><p>In another message, Barrett called a woman the “Holy Grail” and added:</p><blockquote data-type="BlockQuote"><p>I’m not hitting on you. I hope it doesn’t feel like that. I’m married. But I can be honest. You are the .000001 and better be treated like that forever.</p></blockquote><p>The woman replied that her boyfriend treats her “very well” and the former Bungie director replied: “He better cuz I would hit on you if he wasn’t.”</p><p>A different woman working at Bungie claims Barrett called her while drunk late at night and spent hours with her on FaceTime, despite the female employee asking him to respect her boundaries. At one point he allegedly took his phone into his bedroom and said, “I can’t believe I am lying in bed talking to [VICTIM 1].” She abruptly hung up. </p><p>Barrett’s lawyer sent this statement over to <em>Game File: </em></p><blockquote data-type="BlockQuote"><p>Sony continues to disingenuously cherry pick text messages and alleged conversations and make unsupported and conclusory statements to defame Christopher and justify terminating him to avoid paying him what he was owed under his employment agreements. It is telling that Sony does not include the full text messages as exhibits, or the full content of these conversations, and nothing in Sony’s response provides a legitimate legal or factual basis to terminate Christopher for cause.</p></blockquote><p>“Christopher is confident that when all the evidence is presented, it will be clear that Sony engaged in a scheme to strip him of his role and the equity awards he earned for his 25 years of loyal service to the company,” said Barrett’s lawyer. </p><p> .<br></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
