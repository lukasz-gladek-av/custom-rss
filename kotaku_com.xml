              <p>If you or someone you know is constantly teetering on the edge of maxing out their file storage be it on their computer or on a gaming console, in constant need to deleting the old to make room for the new, you or they may find peace by just using an external hard drive. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4989/">Right now, you can save 20% on this Seagate portable external HDD.</a> Amazon normally has it listed at $125, so the discount takes it down by a solid $25. You’re left only have to pay an even $100 for a limited time.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4989/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Xbox and PlayStation Compatible</h2>
<p>This Seagate external hard drive is compatible not just with PCs but also with your Xbox or PlayStation console. The Xbox Series X has an internal SSD with a capacity of only 1TB, while the Xbox Series S has even less with just 512GB. The PlayStation 5 base console is working with 1TB. And keep in mind that these numbers are the total capacity. Some of that space is already used up by necessary system software loaded onto it to make the consoles work, so you’re really only working with a fraction of that for game storage.</p>
<p>The Seagate portable drive can add on a whole 4TB more for storing all your games. That’s great news considering many AAA games as of late have ballooned in file size, with games like <em>Call of Duty Black Ops 7&nbsp;</em>is listed on storefronts as being over 200GB. That will take up almost half your Xbox Series S.</p>



<p>Now there is a catch. While you can download and store your games onto the Xbox Series X|S and PlayStation 5, you can’t actually play them from it. Current gen games require super fast load time with specific hardware that enables certain functionality like Xbox’s Quick Resume feature. So when it comes time to want to play you game, you have to transfer the file from the drive to the console.</p>
<p>While that’s not the most convenient thing in the world, moving files from drive to drive is still exponentially faster than needing to redownload a game from the internet. Moving from a drive is better than that. Think of it like a digital version of taking your game off the shelf and popping the disc in when you’re ready to play. The drive can be your library, and this HDD is far cheaper than an SSD would be that can support playing the games directly from. So this presents a great budget option to maximize your game storage space while minimizing what you’ll have to spend.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/one-of-the-biggest-competitive-pok%C3%A9mon-players-is-taking-a-break-because-of-fan-harassment.1333636/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Wolfe “<a href="https://kotaku.com/shiny-pokemon-scarlet-violet-tatsugiri-dondozo-wolfey-1850157723">WolfeyVGC</a>” Glick is one of the most prolific competitive <em>Pokémon</em> players in the space. He’s won the official World Championship tournament, competed in several events around the world, and has amassed millions of followers on his YouTube channel where he talks about competitive <em>Pokémon</em> and the events he attends. However, Glick says <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wmVgzNasYjI">in a lengthy new video</a> that he will likely step away from in-person events because of harassment from fans.</p> <p>The pro player says he’s had to deal with fans groping him during pictures and pushing boundaries like touching him without consent. He says this meant leaving this year’s Worlds tournament early because he wasn’t able to watch the event in peace after he’d been eliminated and that the stress he feels from these events has now started to outweigh the enjoyment of competing in the tournaments themselves.</p>

 <p>Glick also says he wants to be there primarily to compete, but the fan interactions have begun overtaking his private time at the shows and even, in some cases, prevented him from getting to the matches on time.</p>  <p>Beyond that, Glick says that he doesn’t want to make a video for this year’s Worlds tournament because it would make him “relive” the event and all the bad memories he has associated with it. For now, he’ll be taking time off from in-person events, which could affect whether or not he qualifies for 2026’s World Championship.</p>

 <p>“Even if I do qualify for the World Championships this year, it is very likely that I will not attend,” Glick says in the video. “It’s gonna depend on how the rest of the season and how the rest of these events go. But what I will say is that I do not want to have another Worlds like the one I just had. I would rather not attend than take the risk because I think that if I don’t attend Worlds there’s a chance I could come back in the future. I think if I have one more Worlds like this one, I don’t think I’m coming back.”</p>

 <p>Glick says that these “parasocial” interactions have been a problem both in-person and online. The pro claims that while he isn’t above criticism, the “vitriol” from some has become so prevalent that he’s not comfortable interacting with fans or critics online, and that the unwanted attention has included sexual harassment in online messages too.</p>

 <p>“I guess what I’m trying to say is that I feel like I’ve become more of a symbol and less of a person,” he continues. “There is a lot of responsibility and I’m very privileged to be in that position, but at the same time, I would like to be a person. Sometimes I would like to be Wolfe and not WolfeyVGC.”</p>

 <p>For now, Glick will be taking social media breaks, doing fewer videos, and even playing <a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-legends-za-review-switch-2-bugs-performance-2000637719"><em>Pokémon Legends: Z-A</em></a> in solitude rather than on stream. He signs off the video saying that he still wants to create content about competitive <em>Pokémon</em>, but that he’ll have to take time to reevaluate his approach after these “dehumanizing” experiences. But he isn’t fully walking away and says he still wants to make changes to improve his relationship with the competitive <em>Pokémon</em> space.</p>

 <p>“I always figured that if I stopped competing it would be because competition stopped being fun for me; like I lost the love of the game or maybe I wasn’t able to keep up with a new guard and it was really hard for me to never win. […] The thing I’ll say about this that is positive is that I’m still having fun. I still love competing and I’m still having a blast. If I could just do the competition part of tournaments and not everything else, that would be great for me. […] Because it’s still fun for me, I have motivation to try and fix things.”</p> <div dir="auto" data-qa="virtual-list-item" role="listitem" aria-roledescription="message" data-qa-hover="true" data-qa-unprocessed="false" data-qa-placeholder="false" id="message-list_1761270211.861699" tabindex="0" aria-setsize="-1" data-item-key="1761270211.861699"> <p>He says he’s still looking into arranging meet-and-greets where fans can chat with him in-person, but isn’t yet sure what form those will take moving forward.</p> </div> <p>“I wish that I could do more,” Glick says. “I wish there was more of me to give. I really have tried for so hard for so many years to be the person people see me as, as this symbol, as this kind of unshakable bastion in the scene, but I am only human, and I think pretending that I’m not is not doing me or you any favors.”</p>
