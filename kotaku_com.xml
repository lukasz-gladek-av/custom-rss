              <p>Sony revealed the latest games coming to PS Plus Extra in January 2026 and the headliner will be arriving just in time for anyone who still needs to catch up on Capcom’s survival horror franchise ahead of <a href="https://kotaku.com/resident-evil-requiem-9-capcom-grace-leon-2000632633"><em>Resident Evil Requiem</em></a>.<em> Resident Evil Village</em>, along with eight other games, will all be joining the PlayStation subscription library this month.</p> <p>Even if you’ve never played <em>Resident Evil Village</em>, you’ve probably encountered its fan-favorite vampire giantess <a href="https://kotaku.com/resident-evil-villages-lady-dimitrescu-was-worth-the-wa-1846848171">Lady Alcina Dimitrescu</a>. And while completing <em>Village</em> isn’t essential for anyone planning to play <em>Requiem</em> at launch on February 27, it’ll certainly be a nice option for passing the time until then. The other headliner this month is <a href="https://kotaku.com/infinite-wealth-like-a-dragon-review-kasuga-yakuza-1851190269"><em>Like a Dragon: Infinite Wealth</em></a>, the 2024 <em>Yakuza</em> game that’s a turn-based RPG and the first in the series to go outside of Japan.</p>

 <p>Here’s the full list of games for Extra and Premium tiers in January 2026:</p> <h2>PlayStation Plus Extra And Premium</h2> <ul> <li><em>Resident Evil Village</em> | PS5, PS4</li> <li><em>Like a Dragon: Infinite Wealth</em> | PS5, PS4</li> <li><em>Expeditions: A MudRunner Game</em> | PS5, PS4</li> <li><em>A Quiet Place: The Road Ahead</em> | PS5</li> <li><em>Darkest Dungeon II</em> | PS5, PS4</li> <li><em>The Exit 8</em> | PS5, PS4</li> <li><em>Art of Rally</em> | PS5, PS4</li> <li><em>A Little to the Left</em> | PS5, PS4</li> </ul> <h2><strong>PlayStation Classics (Premium Only)</strong></h2> <ul> <li> <p><em>Ridge Racer</em> | PS5, PS4</p> </li> </ul> <p>I’d like to draw quick attention to two of the smaller games above: <em>Darkest Dungeon II</em> and <em>Art of Rally</em>. Both are excellent. <em>Darkest Dungeon II</em> isn’t what some fans of the original game wanted, but it’s a neat crisis-management RPG mapped onto the roguelike structure of <em>Slay the Spire</em>. <em>Art of Rally</em> is a beautiful, minimalist, chill top down racing game. Give both a try if you haven’t already.</p>

 <p>Oh, and <em>A Little To The Left</em> is great as well, especially for couch buddies who might not normally play games. You organize stuff in unusual ways to unlock little easter eggs. It’s way cooler than it might sound.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><em><a href="https://deadline.com/2026/01/ryan-hurst-cast-kratos-prime-video-god-of-war-1236683097/">Deadline</a> </em>is&nbsp;reporting that Sony and Amazon have tapped <em>Sons of Anarchy </em>and <em>God of War: Ragnarök </em>actor Ryan Hurst to play Kratos in the <a href="https://kotaku.com/god-war-tv-amazon-ps5-release-date-trailer-1851675600">upcoming live-action <em>God of War&nbsp;</em>series</a>.</p> <p>Hurst, who played Thor in the 2022&nbsp;<em>God of War&nbsp;</em>game, will be swapping roles for the show, and will lead the series based on the storylines of the modern <em>GoW </em>games, which find Kratos interacting with (and often fighting) figures from Norse mythology. We still don’t know who will be playing his son Atreus, but it’s cool to have Hurst on as someone who is intimately familiar with the source material.</p>  <p>Along with playing Thor, Hurst’s notable credits include playing Opie in&nbsp;<em>Sons of Anarchy</em>, as well as Beta in the&nbsp;<em>Walking Dead&nbsp;</em>franchise, both in the main series and the <em>Fear the Walking Dead&nbsp;</em>spin-off show. Most recently, he has played Miles in the new Netflix western series&nbsp;<em>The Abandons</em>.</p>

 <p>If you want a quick refresher on Hurst’s acting chops, someone was kind enough to compile all his scenes as Thor in <em>Ragnarök</em>.</p>  <p>That’s the only casting news we have for now, but given that the show seems to be comfortable picking from the game’s cast, it would be interesting to see Sunny Suljic&nbsp; reprise his role as Atreus for the series, though the 20-year-old actor might be a bit too old to play the child as he appeared in the 2018 game at this point. Atreus was still a young teen by the time <em>Ragnarök&nbsp;</em>came around, however, and Suljic still looks pretty young.</p>

 <p>There were rumors that Christopher Judge, the actor who plays Kratos in the Norse <em>God of War&nbsp;</em>games, was also up for the live-action role last year, but Judge himself seemed to debunk these in <a href="https://x.com/iamchrisjudge/status/1968155387863109880">an X post</a> in September.</p> <p>The&nbsp;<em>God of War&nbsp;</em>series is coming from writer, showrunner, and executive producer <a href="https://kotaku.com/god-of-war-tv-ronald-d-moore-battlestar-galactica-1851770751">Ronald D. Moore</a>, who is best known for his work on <em>Star Trek&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Battlestar Galactica</em>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><span>Plenty of </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-legends-za-review-switch-2-bugs-performance-2000637719"><i><span>Pokémon</span></i></a> <span>fans and engineers have created working Pokédexes complete with image recognition to let you scan toys and </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-legends-za-mega-evolution-art-characters-raichu-2000659297"><span>art to identify your favorite monsters</span></a><span>. BigRig Creates and Mr. Volt have taken this a step further, creating what they’re calling the “World’s Smartest” Pokédex, capable of not only recognizing Pokémon, but giving you data about them from the games, acting as a voice assistant, and much more.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/@MrVolt"><span>Mr. Volt</span></a><span> is planning to release a video about the hardware side of things at some point in the future, but BigRig Creates has already put out a 13-minute rundown of how he accomplished all the image recognition and data dumps, and recreated a voice that sounds similar to the original anime’s Pokédex.</span></p>

  <p><span>Much of the coding under the hood draws from the </span><a href="https://pokemondb.net/"><span>Pokémon Database</span></a><span>, which includes lengthy Pokédex entries for all 1025 monsters, complete with stats, learnable attacks, locations in each game, and more. So now, the World’s Smartest dex can tell you pretty much anything you need to know about a Pokémon just by scanning an image of it. The device uses a reverse Google image search to name whatever monster you’re pointing it at, and it can identify anything from plushies to fan art.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><span>The voice, however, needed some tweaking, so BigRig Creates used his own voice to create an AI text-to-speech voice model that sounded closer to the original but didn’t rip the lines from the show. He says this was in an effort to use the tech to make something “ethical” and “homegrown” rather than training it on the performances of actors Nick Stellate and Eric Stuart from the anime.</span></p>

 <p><span>Seeing the completed dex in action is pretty impressive. It correctly identifies several Pokémon, including a Ditto disguised as a Poipole, from toys, plushes, and some hastily drawn Remoraid fan art. It couldn’t quite wrap its head around a Spinda Labubu, though. No tech is perfect, I suppose.</span></p>
