              <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/battlefield-6-bf6-open-beta-revive-medic-help-me-ea-fps-ps5-2000616628"><em>Battlefield 6</em>‘s open beta</a> launched less than 24 hours ago across consoles and PC. And already, there are numerous videos floating around that show players using cheating software that gives them an unfair advantage. This has led to a firestorm online as many PC players are upset about being forced to jump through hoops to use Secure Boot, tech designed to limit malicious activity, yet cheaters are already infesting <a href="https://kotaku.com/7-new-things-weve-learned-about-battlefield-6-multiplayer-2000616043"><em>BF6</em>‘s beta</a>.</p> <p>On August 6, the highly anticipated <a href="https://kotaku.com/battlefield-6-preview-destruction-classes-bf3-bf4-1851787384"><em>Battlefield 6</em></a> open beta went live…if you had an early access code. Yeah, not really an open beta, but whatever. And despite EA devoting a lot of resources to preventing players from cheating, including the required use of Secure Boot, <a href="https://x.com/10IQGaming/status/1953781723592048760">players began sharing videos online</a> of what appear to be people playing the beta while using wallhacks and other cheats that reveal information about enemy players that shouldn’t be available. <a href="https://x.com/vaccoin/status/1953805256195793383">One video</a> I found featured a montage, complete with music, of what appears to be one person killing dozens and dozens of other players across various matches and maps in the <em>Battlefield 6</em> open beta.</p> <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">All first-person shooters, like Counter-Strike 2, are affected by cheating ⚠️</p> <p>Despite Anti-Cheat announcements, Battlefield 6 has been affected since day one 🚫 <a href="https://t.co/cwxLPanq2N">pic.twitter.com/cwxLPanq2N</a></p> <p>— CS2 Vaccoin (@vaccoin) <a href="https://twitter.com/vaccoin/status/1953805256195793383?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">August 8, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <p><a href="https://x.com/ItsHapa/status/1953515565084967379">Another video</a> of what appears to be a <em>BF6</em> open beta cheater has racked up nearly seven million views on Twitter. The video’s popularity and the huge response to it were big enough to attract the attention of <em>Battlefield</em> producer Alexia Christofi, <a href="https://x.com/Lex_mate/status/1953572607074202062">who replied and explained</a> that the team was aware of the cheating and that she believed the player in the clip had already been banned.&nbsp; So far, the cheating appears to be only on PC, though because of crossplay, these cheaters can play against Xbox and PS5 users.</p>

 <p><em>Kotaku</em> has contacted EA about the cheating seen in the videos and asked for more information on the situation.</p> <p>Of course, there’s no way to completely stop people from cheating in a video game that can be downloaded locally to a PC or console. But what is angering many players online is that <em>Battlefield 6</em>, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/720007/call-of-duty-pc-anti-cheat-secure-boot-windows-black-ops-7">like the upcoming <em>Call of Duty Black Ops 7</em></a>, requires PC users to use Secure Boot. This is a relatively new technology that helps prevent malicious software from booting up on a Windows PC. <a href="https://www.callofduty.com/blog/2025/08/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-ricochet-anti-cheat-season-05">Here’s how Activision describes the tech</a>: “Secure Boot makes sure a PC can only load trusted software when Windows starts.”</p> <p>The problem is that on some older setups, Secure Boot requires users to screw around with their BIOS, which can cause a lot of damage to a PC if done incorrectly. I mean, look at <a href="https://help.ea.com/en/articles/technical-issues/secure-boot/">EA’s support page about Secure Boot</a> and the steps needed just to see if the feature is active or not on your computer, and you can see why it’s giving a lot of players trouble. And even if it does work, it’s a lot of hoops to jump through, and the end result is that people are still cheating. <em>BF6</em> isn’t even out yet, just in open beta, and cheaters have, in less than 48 hours, gotten wallhacks working in the game. You can understand why some players are royally upset about the whole situation.</p>

 <p>Vince Zampella, the head of Battlefield Studios, was asked about anti-cheat last week and <a href="https://youtu.be/MAA7X9J-Y8Q?t=831">said that until the “day we die, we will be fighting” cheaters</a>.</p> <p>“It’s a weird one, because you don’t want to talk about what you’re doing,” said Zampella in an interview with Gaming Interviews on YouTube. “It gives people that are trying to cheat a head start against you. It’s a huge thing in the industry, in gaming. It’s a constant arms race that we’re always putting a lot of effort into, know that. It’s something that we would stamp out completely if we could, it’s just an arms race. To the day we die, we will be fighting it.”</p>

 <p><em><strong>Updated: 8/8/2025, 4:40 p.m. ET:</strong> </em><a href="https://forums.ea.com/discussions/battlefield-6-beta-feedback-en/battlefield-6-update-on-secure-boot--cheats/12439803">EA has published a forum post</a> detailing its efforts to combat cheating in the <em>BF6</em> open beta. The company explained that Secure Boot isn’t and was never intended to be a “silver bullet” against cheating in the game. It’s just part of a larger effort to combat naughty players. EA also claims to have prevented over 300,000 attempts to cheat or tamper with <em>Battlefield 6</em>‘s open beta, and it’s received over 100,000 reports of players who might be cheating. They are now working to remove those players who are actually cheating.</p> <p>“Anti-Cheat isn’t one and done,” explained an EA rep. “It’s an ever-evolving battlefield, and what has worked for us previously or in different games doesn’t always work in all of them. I hope this helps, and please keep the reports coming in – we’ll continue cleaning up the cheaters so you can have a fair game.”</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              
              <p>I had a <i>good</i> time with <a href="https://kotaku.com/new-doom-dark-ages-review-is-it-good-xbox-ps5-game-pass-1851779839"><i>Doom: The Dark Ages</i></a> this year. Maybe it even peaked at “great” a few times. I can’t say I remember much of the story, which was a major focus of this new <i>Doom</i>, but I did have a solid 20 or so hours blasting demons and cranking up the difficulty as high as it could go. And now a new update has arrived that amps things up even further with <i>The Dark Ages</i>’ take on the Ripatorium.</p> <p><b>Read More:</b> <a href="https://kotaku.com/new-doom-dark-ages-review-is-it-good-xbox-ps5-game-pass-1851779839"><i>Doom: The Dark Ages</i>: The <i>Kotaku</i> Review</a></p> <p>The Ripatorium showed up in 2020’s <i>Doom Eternal</i>, though then it was a part of the game’s campaign and you’d have to reload a specific checkpoint if you wanted to grind it for fun or practice. <i>The Dark Ages</i>, however, reintroduces the concept as a test of your wits and fortitude that you can play as many times as you want—there’s even an endless mode if you really just want to dig in and refuse to let go. You can select up to 60 enemies from <i>The Dark Ages</i> to do battle with and it’s a ton of fun—but don’t be surprised if you end up in over your head at first.</p> <p>On my first run through the Ripatorium, I maxed out all 60 enemy slots, half of which were fodder to keep my ammo reserves up. The rest were chosen at random from whatever looked the most intimidating. That was a bad idea, as I’d soon discover, since it turns out my <i>Dark Ages</i> skills are quite rusty. That said, having several of <i>Dark Ages</i>’ biggest baddies all rush you at once is not only hilarious, it’s the kind of challenge that will call me to my ruin before I show them who’s really in charge here (me, the answer is me…eventually).</p>

You can <a href="https://slayersclub.bethesda.net/en-US/article/doom-the-dark-ages-update-2-release-notes">read the full update notes here</a>.</p> <p>The Ripatorium may have shut my cocky ass down at first, but it’s nice to have a reason to jump back into <i>The Dark Ages</i>’ neat guns-and-shield gameplay. And currently it says “Ripatorium 1.0” in the main menu, so hopefully we’ll see some nice additions to this endless mode of carnage in the future.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              
              <p>During a recent concert, pop star and former <em>American Idol</em> judge Katy Perry was asked by a fan in the audience to sing the Simlish version of “Last Friday Night” as it appeared in <a href="https://kotaku.com/the-sims-3-sucks-1826683414"><em>The Sims 3</em></a>‘s DLC “<a href="https://kotaku.com/katy-perry-is-now-making-video-games-5876893">Katy Perry’s Sweet Treats.</a>” And the singer obliged, singing a good chunk of the song live in front of a lot of people who were likely confused as to why Perry was suddenly singing in gibberish.</p> <p>Released in 2009, Maxis and EA’s <em>The Sims 3</em> was a massive hit and received plenty of post-launch DLC and updates, as is the case with nearly every major <em>Sims</em> game. One of these DLCs was a <a href="https://sims.fandom.com/wiki/The_Sims_3:_Katy_Perry%27s_Sweet_Treats">2012 Stuff Pack that was themed entirely around Katy Perry</a>. It added new clothes, hairstyles, in-game items, and locations to <em>The Sims 3.</em> It also included a new in-game song: A version of “Last Friday Night” sung in Simlish (the franchise’s made-up language) by Katy Perry. It was a pretty popular pack, and her Simlish rendition of the pop hit became a bit of a viral meme back in the day. Fast forward to August 6 of this year when–as seen in a video posted on Twitter–Perry was handed a piece of paper at a concert that contained the lyrics to that Simlish version of the song.</p> <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">there's always sth unexpected happening at katy perry’s tour cuz wdym we got Last Friday Night sims version on the setlist last night 😭 <a href="https://t.co/7cGTbVzJTw">pic.twitter.com/7cGTbVzJTw</a></p> <p>— Fadi ¹⁴³ (@TheWitnessedBoy) <a href="https://twitter.com/TheWitnessedBoy/status/1953382847382741409?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">August 7, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <p>“Oh no, I shouldn’t do this…” Perry joked as she walked up to some fans who appeared to be signaling for attention and requesting her to sing the Simlish pop song. She then added, “Let’s just go to the chorus,” likely not wanting to perform the entire song in Simlish during a live concert. To Perry’s credit, she sang the strange version of the song using the provided lyrics, despite being unable to read the small text properly without her reading glasses.</p> <p>After singing, she shouted out, “I’m sorry, you had to be there, 2009 and 10.” Which is funny, but also inaccurate, Katy Perry. You performed the Simlish version of “Last Friday Night” in 2012. There’s even a video of you singing it in a recording booth for EA! Speaking of, let’s end this blog with that video. Roll that footage!</p> <p><iframe loading="lazy" title="Katy Perry - Last Friday Night in Simlish" width="500" height="281" src="about:blank" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen="" data-rocket-lazyload="fitvidscompatible" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/sxyW6AJ-yIk?feature=oembed"></iframe></p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/gta-6-online-trailer-players-growth-release-date-2000616669</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/grand-theft-auto-online-just-won%E2%80%99t-stop-adding-new-players.1265862/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              
              <p>The sun just refuses to set on <a href="https://kotaku.com/gta-online-gtav-ps5-xbox-series-x-next-gen-review-impre-1848652706"><em>Grand Theft Auto Online</em></a>. Even with<em> GTA 6</em> delayed into next year, the current entry’s multiplayer mode is seeing an surprising surge in new and returning players. Rockstar Games’ parent company, Take-Two, just revealed the 12-year-old spin-off is 50 percent more popular than it was last year.</p> <p>“During the quarter, engagement for <em>Grand Theft Auto Online</em>&nbsp;benefited from the record-setting launch of&nbsp;<em>Grand Theft Auto VI</em> Trailer 2 and the successful release of the ‘<em>Money Fronts</em>‘ Summer content pack, which culminated in higher than expected recurrent consumer spending growth,” the company announced in its quarterly earnings report this week. “We are pleased that new player accounts<em>&nbsp;</em>for&nbsp;<em>GTA Online&nbsp;</em>grew over 50 percent year-over-year.”</p> <p>Every company that delays one of the most anticipated releases of all-time by more than six months should be so lucky. At this rate, Rockstar could push back the release of <em>GTA 6</em> from May to October 2026 and see <em>GTA Online</em> potentially double in popularity in just two years, <a href="https://kotaku.com/gta-online-future-updates-gta6-take-two-ceo-support-1851763665">merely by dropping new trailers for the sequel</a>.</p>

 <p>I guess all of those people still buying <em>GTA V</em> each month are for real. The game was the <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/matpiscatella.bsky.social/post/3lun37lnhg22k">ninth best-selling game of the year so far in June</a>. That was up from being the 15th best-selling overall in 2024. Even if that number eventually comes down by the end of 2025, it would still be incredible if<em> GTA V</em> sold&nbsp;<em>just as well</em> as it had the year prior after more than a decade of being out in the wild.</p> <p>No wonder Rockstar has been content to take its time with the sequel while everyone else selling games on consoles battles to convince <em>GTA Online</em> fans to take a chance on buying something new. Shutting <em>GTA Online</em> down for good would be terrible for Take-Two’s shareholders but it <a href="https://kotaku.com/best-selling-games-2024-hogwarts-legacy-dragon-ball-1851746095">might spread the wealth around a bit</a> and give great games from other studios a better shot at getting recognized. Or all of those people would just go play <em>Fortnite</em> and <em>Roblox</em> instead.</p>
