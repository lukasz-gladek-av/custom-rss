              <p><span>Game Freak’s established promotional pipeline for </span><i><span>Pokémon </span></i><span>games has the company using 3D renders, rather than hand-drawn art, to reveal new monsters ahead of each game’s launch. Anyone who cares about getting good assets of these new critters knows that this is the purgatory The Pokémon Company puts us through as we wait for the gorgeous illustrations we’ll get post-release, which resemble the </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-ken-sugimori-original-art-red-blue-gold-silver-1850352781"><span>old Ken Sugimori art</span></a><span> that you see featured on database sites like </span><a href="https://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Raichu_(Pok%C3%A9mon)"><span>Bulbapedia</span></a><span>. Today, January 13, we finally got the art drop for </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-legends-za-review-switch-2-bugs-performance-2000637719"><i><span>Pokémon Legends: Z-A</span></i></a><span> and its </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-legends-za-mega-dimension-review-dlc-raichu-2000653106"><i><span>Mega Dimension</span></i></a> <span>DLC. And oh boy, there’s some beauts here.</span></p> <p><span>Most of the art is of the several dozen new Mega Evolutions added in </span><i><span>Legends: Z-A </span></i><span>and its expansion, but it also includes official artwork of some of the major characters who show up later in the game and weren’t part of the initial marketing push. Notably, this includes Lysandre, Grisham, and Griselle, ex-members of the villainous Team Flare, some of the only truly “secret” characters who are crucial to some of the late game reveals. </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/the-best-video-game-characters-of-2025-2000655443"><span>Lysandre</span></a><span> in particular was kept under wraps, given he was long presumed dead after the events of </span><i><span>Pokémon X </span></i><span>and </span><i><span>Y</span></i><span>. I suppose The Pokémon Company is ripping that bandage off. You had three months to play the game, so the aged, immortal version of Lysandre we get in </span><i><span>Z-A </span></i><span>might start showing up in more marketing material now that he’s being acknowledged through official channels.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><span>But the real treat is the good art we finally have of all the Mega Evolutions, including my boy </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-legends-za-mega-dimension-evolution-raichu-x-2000652246"><span>Mega Raichu X</span></a><span>, the meme king </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-horizons-anime-mega-starmie-friede-episode-2000654235"><span>Mega Starmie</span></a><span>, and some of the lesser-known transformations that debuted in the </span><i><span>Mega Dimension </span></i><span>DLC. Click through to see them all.</span></p>

 <p><span>Yesterday, The Pokémon Company announced the </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/lego-pokemon-pikachu-date-price-mega-bloks-teaser-1851770713"><span>official Pokémon x Lego collaboration models</span></a><span>, including sets for Pikachu, Eevee, and a disgustingly expensive one of the Kanto starters. If you </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/comparing-legos-new-200-pikachu-set-to-mega-bloks-50-version-2000658904"><span>compare them to the Mega Bloks models</span></a><span>, though, you might decide to buy those cheaper sets instead.</span></p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/seagates-xbox-storage-expansion-card-drops-below-0-12-per-gb-at-a-new-year-record-low-as-amazon-clears-out-the-best-selling-ssd-2000656513</link>
            <guid>1404652</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p data-start="0" data-end="1023">Gaming has a file size problem. In recent years, we’ve seen video games reach overwhelmingly large sizes. This is particularly true for many big-budget games developed by Western AAA studios. Take <em data-start="286" data-end="308">Oblivion: Remastered</em>, for example, which has a file size of over 120GB. It’s hard to even imagine how much space <em data-start="401" data-end="422">Grand Theft Auto VI</em> will occupy when it’s eventually released. With games consuming such vast amounts of storage, it’s a challenge for players—especially since consoles like the Xbox Series X still come with only 1TB of internal storage. If you want to play more than just a few games, you’ll find yourself constantly managing space by deleting and reinstalling titles, which isn’t exactly convenient. A far better solution is to invest in a dedicated external storage drive. Seagate offers one that’s made specifically for the Xbox Series X and Series S, and it’s currently available at a significant discount for a limited time.</p>
<p data-start="1025" data-end="1395"><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6128/">Amazon is offering three versions of Seagate’s Xbox expansion card at reduced prices right now</a>. The 1TB model, typically priced at $160, is on sale for $149, giving you a $11 discount. The 2TB version has dropped from $260 to $230, saving you $30.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6128/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<p data-start="1397" data-end="1743">Since the Xbox Series X comes with just 1TB of storage, adding one of these Seagate drives will either double, triple, or even quintuple your available space for Xbox games—depending on which model you choose. This extra storage will make a huge difference if you want to keep a variety of games installed without constantly managing your space.</p>
<p data-start="1745" data-end="2146">Installing the Seagate expansion card is incredibly simple. Unlike the PS5, which requires users to open the console casing to install an SSD, the Seagate drive for Xbox Series X and S plugs directly into a dedicated slot at the back of the console. No tools are needed. Once it’s plugged in, you can select whether you want to save new games to the internal storage or to your Seagate expansion card.</p>


<h2 data-start="1745" data-end="2146">Swap Between Games With Ease</h2>
<p data-start="2148" data-end="2610">What’s more, games saved to the Seagate drive perform just as well as those stored on your Xbox’s internal storage. A major selling point of the current generation of Xbox consoles is Quick Resume, which allows you to suspend one game and switch to another without losing your progress. You can jump from a high-speed race in <em data-start="2495" data-end="2512">Forza Horizon 5</em> to a quick match in <em data-start="2533" data-end="2548">Rocket League</em>, then return to your original&nbsp;<em>Forza&nbsp;</em>race right where you left off.</p>
<p data-start="2612" data-end="2975" data-is-last-node="" data-is-only-node="">Seagate’s expansion cards are officially licensed to support Xbox’s Velocity Architecture, which powers Quick Resume. This means any game you store on the Seagate drive will benefit from Quick Resume, just like games stored on the internal drive. Whether you’re downloading a new title or moving an existing one, the experience will remain seamless and efficient.</p>
<p data-start="2612" data-end="2975" data-is-last-node="" data-is-only-node="">With lots of massive titles set to release this year such as <em>GTA VI</em> and <em>007 First Light</em>, now is a great time to expand your Xbox storage. Grab Seagate’s Xbox expansion card for as little as $160 for a limited time.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Anker Prime Docking Station (14-Port, 160W) Crashes to Lowest Price of the Year, Now Cheaper Than During Last Holidays]]></title>
            <link>https://kotaku.com/anker-prime-docking-station-14-port-160w-crashes-to-lowest-price-of-the-year-now-cheaper-than-during-last-holidays-2000659243</link>
            <guid>1404604</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Anker’s Prime Docking Station is a 14-port hub that can power your laptop and accessories and drive dual monitors from a very small footprint. It comes in a sleek, vertically oriented case that can be placed on your desk. Up front, it has ports for charging your devices, and on the back side, ports for data, video, and networking access. There is also a small LED screen that shows which ports are currently active and how power is being distributed. The device can handle both power and data transfer simultaneously, with a maximum of 160W of power distribution and 10 Gbps of data speed, making it a powerful tool for organizing your various accessories.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4389/">Click here to purchase the Anker Prime Docking Station for $170 on Amazon, discounted from its regular retail price of $270. This is a savings of $100, or 37% off.</a></p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4389/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>A quick and easy way to perform cable management with all your devices</h2>
<p>The Anker Prime Docking Station includes four USB-C ports, five USB-A ports, dual HDMI ports, an Ethernet jack, and audio jacks. The two USB-C ports on the front of the dock can deliver up to 160W of power and charge up to two devices simultaneously. Each port can provide up to 100W to a single compatible laptop, allowing you to charge your laptop while working. The rear USB-C and USB-A data ports support transfer speeds up to 10 Gbps, enabling faster transfers of large files between external storage devices and your computer. Since all your peripherals are attached to the docking station via a single upstream USB-C connection, you don’t have to unplug any peripherals when you disconnect your laptop.</p>



<p>The Anker Prime Docking Station features dual HDMI outputs for connecting multiple external monitors to your laptop. For example, you can connect two separate 4K monitors at 60 Hz, giving you ample space to spread out multiple applications across both. Alternatively, if you prefer a simple layout, you can connect a single monitor and still have the second HDMI port available for a television or projector.</p>
<p>The Anker Prime Docking Station is compatible with USB-C, USB4, and Thunderbolt laptops that support DisplayPort Alt Mode and USB-C Power Delivery, including but not limited to: many Windows 10, Windows 11, and Chrome OS laptops. Mac laptops can also use the dock; however, the two external monitors will mirror each other instead of providing a traditional three-monitor desktop environment. Note that the dock is not compatible with Linux laptops, and some gaming laptops may require their own chargers to operate at optimal levels. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4389/">At a discounted price of $170, down from $270, the Anker Prime Docking Station is an effective way to convert a single USB-C port into a powered 14-port desktop configuration.</a></p>

            <title><![CDATA[The Stranger Things Documentary Gave Season 5 Haters More Ammunition]]></title>
            <link>https://kotaku.com/stranger-things-season-5-documentary-chatgpt-reddit-2000659351</link>
            <guid>1404601</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><span>Given the very loud fallout from </span><i><span>Stranger Things</span></i><span>’ </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/stranger-things-season-5-finale-reaction-byler-acting-2000656424"><span>series finale</span></a><span> and a portion of the horror show’s fandom descending into </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/stranger-things-secret-finale-conformity-gate-explained-2000656704"><span>a mass hysteria</span></a><span> in believing that a secret ninth episode </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/stranger-things-conformity-gate-secret-netflix-crash-2000658155"><span>might fix the whole season</span></a><span>, I have to wonder if there were any conversations at Netflix about not releasing the </span><i><span>One Last Adventure: The Making of Stranger Things 5 </span></i><span>documentary that went live on the streaming service yesterday, January 12. Already, every word that series creators the Duffer Brothers had been uttering in interviews </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/stranger-things-season-5-finale-matt-duffer-interview-2000656663"><span>was being picked apart</span></a><span>, and now the conspiratorial mindset fueling that scrutiny has been given a lot of new wood to burn by the documentary.</span></p> <p><span>The two-hour documentary includes behind-the-scenes footage of the writers’ room and table readings, as well as the set of the show during shooting. In a world where </span><i><span>Stranger Things </span></i><span>hadn’t been combed through by fans looking for any proof that a secret episode was coming, it could have been viewed as a surprisingly honest look at all the moving parts a production of this scale has to contend with. But there’s a segment of </span><i><span>Stranger Things </span></i><span>fans looking for any explanation as to how it all went wrong, and the documentary sure has a few moments that fans are latching onto.</span></p>

 <p><span>Some of the things people are pointing out are mostly speculative. In one section, the Duffer Brothers are shown with what fans believe to be </span><a href="https://x.com/PopCrave/status/2010896631034707994"><span>ChatGPT</span></a><span> and </span><a href="https://x.com/SThingsMeme/status/2010679300282871909"><span>Reddit tabs</span></a><span> open on a computer while writing the script for a season five episode. The Reddit logo is pretty clear in one shot, but the ChatGPT one is more contested. Even so, these tabs being open doesn’t actually confirm anything, but detractors are running around with accusations that the Duffers used ChatGPT or relied on fan discussions on Reddit when making important creative decisions, all based on…open tabs? Let’s be serious.</span><span><br> </span></p>

 <p><span>As for more substantial stuff, a few scenes in the documentary have caught the eye of people critical of the season, and more specifically, of the Duffer Brothers. At one point during filming of the finale, Montana Maniscalco, the key production assistant on the show, says that the episode isn’t completely written yet, with the presumptive takeaway being that the Duffer Brothers must still be trying to figure out how the season is going to end this late into production.</span></p>

   <p><span>Other scenes of note include a moment in the writers’ room in which writer Paul Dichter said that there should be more monsters in the finale’s climactic battle, even going so far as to name the Demogorgon from season one as a potential foe for the </span><i><span>Stranger Things </span></i><span>crew to face in the final fight. He says it would be “crazy” if there was nothing there. Well, if you saw the finale, you know that’s exactly what happened, and it seems Dichter’s feedback was “ignored.”</span></p>

   <p><span>In another clip, Maya Hawke is seen discussing a moment her character shares with her girlfriend Vickie. Their relationship is a secret at this point in the story, and we see Hawke is saying she wants to have this conversation “in a whisper.” This, too, is being read in the most bad faith way, with the narrative being that Hawke is having to “remind” the crew about things the writers “forgot” about characters, rather than actors sharing ideas on how things should be played because they’re a part of this process, too, and might have opinions.</span></p>

   <p><span>I don’t mean to be dismissive of people who didn’t like the ending, but I have “</span><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asthkXjWWQ0"><span>played these games before</span></a><span>.” I know what it’s like to be searching for any justification for your disappointment and projecting narratives onto some pretty normal interactions in a creative space. I can’t speak for why they ignored Dichter’s note about the monsters, but Hawke’s point about tweaking that scene? That shit happens all the time in movies and TV. We had this same conversation when James Gunn and David Corenswet </span><a href="https://www.youtube.com/shorts/auz1txQ5WVc"><span>had a debate about some lines in the </span><i><span>Superman </span></i><span>movie</span></a><span>. People reacted to it as if it was a “fight,” but this is literally just something that happens when you’re collaborating with someone else on a creative project.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><span>I know the confirmation bias is too embedded in the </span><i><span>Stranger Things </span></i><span>fandom right now, with people still holding out hope that there’s another finale locked away in a vault somewhere waiting to fix everything. Y’all can keep fighting ghosts, but I do hope that the people who are still caught up in this conspiratorial cycle find their way out of it.</span></p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/dysons-carboat-handheld-vacuum-drops-to-a-record-low-now-priced-like-a-budget-cleaner-2000659256</link>
            <guid>1404550</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>If you have a car or boat, it can be difficult to keep things tidy if you don’t have an appropriately sized set of tools. A handheld vac is just what you need to save the day. We’ve found one that you’ll absolutely love using, and it won’t break the bank. The Dyson Car+Boat Handheld Vacuum delivers strong cordless suction in a compact form factor that’s perfect for tight spaces, using Dyson’s digital motor and cyclone technology to maintain consistent performance from start to finish. This handheld vacuum weighs about 4.2 pounds, making it easy to maneuver around vehicle interiors, storage compartments, and other confined areas without strain.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6749/">Head over to Amazon to get the Dyson Car+Boat Handheld Vacuum for just $229, down from its usual price of $299. That’s a discount of $70 and 23% off.</a></p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6749/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Compact Design With Serious Suction</h2>
<p>Designed specifically for mobile environments, the vacuum has super strong suction as well as a mini motorized tool that uses a rotating brush bar to lift dirt and hair from upholstery and carpets. A Crevice tool helps reach narrow gaps between seats or along trim lines, while the Combination tool transitions between a wide nozzle and soft brush for dusting hard surfaces.</p>
<p>These attachments connect directly to the vacuum body, so you don’t lose them somewhere else. Plus, the bin holds about 0.14 gallons of dirt and debris and uses Dyson’s point-and-shoot mechanism to get rid of extra dirt.</p>



<p>Cordless operation plays a major role in how this vacuum fits into real-world cleaning routines, eliminating the need to manage cords or find nearby outlets. The balanced handle design keeps weight centered in the hand, which helps during longer cleaning sessions across multiple surfaces. Two power settings let you prioritize either maximum runtime or increased suction depending on the mess you are dealing with. That means the vacuum is super flexible. It can handle loose dust, sand, pet hair, and embedded debris with confidence.</p>
<p>Battery performance remains consistent throughout the cleaning cycle, with fade-free suction designed to deliver steady airflow until the charge is depleted. Recharging is handled through the included charger, and the vacuum is ready for repeated use without complex setup. Plus, it has washable filters so you don’t have to keep spending money on things like that.</p>
<p>Beyond cars and boats, the vacuum adapts well to stairs, furniture, shelves, and other areas where larger machines feel cumbersome. The compact body makes storage simple, and switching attachments is quick when moving between different surfaces. Dyson includes a two-year warranty, adding reassurance around long-term reliability and support.If you want an easy to use vacuum that’s perfect for keeping your car or boat (or other vehicle or small space) tidy, this is a great choice to get started with.</p>
