But a new look at an improved gameplay feature in the upcoming remake, <em>Metal Gear Solid Delta</em>, might just be enough to convert this jaded fan who’s convinced the series peaked at <em>Sons of Liberty</em>. In a 12-second clip, Naked Snake can be seen swapping his camo from a foresty look to something more suitable for an urban environment in record time. It’s way faster and less cumbersome-looking than the camo-swapping of the original. Check it out:</p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="196411" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="A Typical Day On Persona 3 Reload’s Tatsumi Port Island" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="378" data-playlist="196411,196805,196055" data-current="196411"><div><p>A Typical Day On Persona 3 Reload’s Tatsumi Port Island</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196411/196411_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196411/196411_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196411/196411_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196411/196411_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/21958.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>Hell yeah, that’s a whole three seconds to swap camo with an in-game menu that looks pretty snappy. The original required you to pause the game, then select “camouflage” from a menu, then select “face” or “uniform” before choosing your desired pattern.</p><p>As I said earlier, at best I feel sorta “meh” about <em>MGS3</em>; the menu-diving the original demands of you to swap camo, eat anything, and treat your wounds is one of its biggest offenders in my opinion (alongside the boring, self-indulgent story and that god awful song). I found it very hard to stay engaged in the action when the game made me sort through menu screens so often, despite the camo being a genuinely neat idea. </p><p><em>Metal Gear Solid 4: Guns of the Patriots</em> notably eschewed the whole eating and wound-healing stuff (for the better). It would keep the camo, though. And since it took place many decades after <em>MGS3</em>, there was a sci-fi twist on it that made things much smoother. In <em>MGS4</em>, Old Snake could just lean against almost any wall and <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://youtu.be/giKSkJtuaB0&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://youtu.be/giKSkJtuaB0" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">absorb the texture via his nifty OctoCamo</a></span> which, it turns out, was inspired by the natural camouflage abilities of real-life octopi. </p><p>The natural ability of octopi was also referenced in <em>MGS4</em> via the game’s opening faux TV ads.</p><p>While some of us might be a little skeptical of this post-Kojima <em>MGS</em> future we’re entering with <em>Delta</em>, it’s nice to see Konami looking for opportunities to improve existing aspects of the game. Here’s hoping eating and wound-healing will be just as speedy in the remake, which arrives on PS5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC on August 28, 2025.</p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
