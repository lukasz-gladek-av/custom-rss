So far, there are <em>twelve</em>, and it’s absolutely bewildering.</p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="192873" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="The Week In Games: Pocket Monsters And Simulated Goats" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="133" data-playlist="192873,196165,195752" data-current="192873"><div><p>The Week In Games: Pocket Monsters And Simulated Goats</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/192873/192873_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/192873/192873_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/192873/192873_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/192873/192873_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/18337.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>Free-to-play games having multiple currencies is, again, nothing new, and it’s all by design, all a part of the psychological systems to have you desperate to top things up, keep things ticking, and if you can <em>just</em> get three more of these, then a whole other thing unlocks! And, again, the big issue here is that this is <em>Pokémon</em> doing it to an audience with a huge proportion of children, and indeed delivering it in the most byzantine way imaginable.</p><p>To discover just how bonkers this all is, on the game’s main page, there’s a button on the bottom-right with three lines. Tap that, and there’s an option below “Shop” called “Items.” Click on this innocuous little word, and the lunacy is revealed.</p><p>Let’s lay it all out:</p><ul data-type="List" data-style="Bullet"><li>Poké gold (non-paid)</li><li>Poké gold (paid)</li><li>Shinedust</li><li>Shop ticket</li><li>Special shop ticket</li><li>Premium ticket</li><li>Pack Hourglass</li><li>Wonder Hourglass</li><li>Event Hourglass</li><li>Advance Ticket</li><li>Event Shop Ticket (Meowth)</li><li>Emblem Ticket (Genetic Apex)</li><li>Rewind Watch</li></ul><p>Now, we’re being generous here, including the two types of gold as one to get to that total of 12. And if your list doesn’t have that many, that’s because you currently don’t own any of them. It’s a list that just keeps expanding, and given the specificity of the Event Shop Ticket and Emblem Ticket, we must assume that there are other types of these to come.</p><p>You might expect me here to go through explaining what each type does, but you know what? Not even The Pokémon Company seems willing to share that. That Advance Ticket’s entry reads, “This ticket cannot be used yet. Wait and see what it’s for!”</p><p>Um, no? Just tell me? It’s already annoying enough as it is.</p><figure id="" data-id="048e105d6c3449b0bf3cf18b9820490c" data-recommend-id="image://048e105d6c3449b0bf3cf18b9820490c" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The Items page in Pocket, on a blurry background." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="The Items page in Pocket, on a blurry background." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->The Pokémon Company / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="048e105d6c3449b0bf3cf18b9820490c" data-recommend-id="image://048e105d6c3449b0bf3cf18b9820490c" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The Items page in Pocket, on a blurry background." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Most of these currencies are used to buy items from specific pages of the game’s shop, which itself is laid out as if it got caught in one of those Doctor Strange spells where all the buildings and train tracks start spinning and weaving inside one another. To spend the Event Shop Ticket (Meowth), you need to go to the “Limited Time / Events” section of the shop, and then to the Event page within that, as distinct from the Premium page, Poké gold page, and the mysterious and always-empty “Other.” There’s another Other in the “Main” section of the shop, which is also empty! Is it empty of the same things? No one knows!</p><p>Special Shop Tickets are gained when you sacrifice multiple versions of full-art or better cards, which the game never explains at any point, and require you to have somehow gathered three or more of the same incredibly rare art. We’re talking about cards with a 0.3 percent (or worse, getting as low as 0.013 percent) chance of coming out of a pack here. You get <em>one</em> of those per card (I know, because infuriatingly I’ve somehow pulled three of the gorgeous Snorlax full-art card), and the cheapest item in this shop costs <em>seven</em> Special Shop Tickets. That’s for the presentation backgrounds, rather than the fancy black-and-silver sleeves, playmat or coin you might want—they cost 12 tickets each!</p><p>Oh wait! Hang on! It <em>is</em> thirteen currencies, because I completely forgot to include Pack Points! Yeah, there’s yet another system that it doesn’t even bother to remember when listing what you own. These are the points you can use to exchange for cards you might want in your deck, gained by opening packs, and only appearing—not when you’re building packs or on any of the card screens—but when you’re on the page to select a new sealed pack to open...</p><p>WHO LET ANY OF THIS HAPPEN?!</p><p>I have to stop writing now, in case I discover a fourteenth currency I’d not seen before now and have an aneurysm.</p><p>And why is it like this? To deliberately confuse you. To make sure you’re never certain which currency is one you should be holding onto and which is one that has no other purpose than to be spent there and then. And to constantly dangle numbers in front of you that could get higher if only you bought just a teensy bit of gold. Some directly, like hourglasses, where shortages can be made up by subbing in gold you own; others indirectly by only arriving if you buy the (abysmal) Premium Pass, or won by continuing playing that Event where you just ran out of hourglasses...</p><p>Next time, the <em>eight</em> different pages of Missions!</p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

That film, which I love, tells the story of a blue, pudgy alien criminal who crashes in Hawaii and befriends a little girl as he pretends to be her puppy to avoid being captured by authorities. As with all of Disney’s popular animated movies these days, <em>Lilo &amp; Stitch</em> is getting remade as a live-action film. And our first real look at the character has me nervous. </p><p>On November 8, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://x.com/DisneyStudios/status/1854968360397640011&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://x.com/DisneyStudios/status/1854968360397640011" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">the official Disney Twitter account posted</a></span> an image of Stitch as he will appear in the May 2025 live-action adaptation of the animated movie.

My first complaint is simple: He’s not blue enough! </p><p>My second complaint is that Stitch doesn’t look pudgy and round enough. One of the best parts of<em> Lilo &amp; Stitch</em> is how characters in the movie have this round and oblong appearance<span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://characterdesignreferences.com/art-of-animation-5/art-of-lilo-stitch&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://characterdesignreferences.com/art-of-animation-5/art-of-lilo-stitch" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">. It was very different from the usual house style</a></span> seen in most Disney animated flicks back in the day, and as a kid, I adored that visual. Stitch was cute and very funny, too, which also helped me fall in love with the film.</p><p>This new Stitch is giving me live-action Sonic vibes, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/sonic-movie-first-trailer-ugly-design-delay-redesign-1851446390&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/sonic-movie-first-trailer-ugly-design-delay-redesign-1851446390">but before he was fixed and made less ugly and horrible looking.</a></span> That’s not a good thing! </p><p>Now, let me just say that I’m not angry about Stitch’s new look. I’m not going to send threatening messages to people who worked on the film or start some online campaign to harass people or create videos complaining that Disney is “ruining” Stitch. </p><p>At the end of the day, this is a movie designed for kids. It ain’t for me. And if I really, really don’t like the new Stich, I can just watch the OG film and not worry about the remake. See, this is how adults handle this kind of stuff. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/a-minecraft-movie-trailer-jack-black-kids-1851640395&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/a-minecraft-movie-trailer-jack-black-kids-1851640395">You don’t need to get angry or toxic</a></span>. Just point out that something is either not for you or objectively bad and move on. </p><p><em>Lilo &amp; Stitch</em> arrives in theaters on May 23, 2025. I hope he looks more blue in the actual movie. </p><p> .<br></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

The update is bringing more loadout options, maps, and teases for mid-season zombies reveals. </p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="196049" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="This Modern Warfare 3 Gameplay Feature Spices Up A Weak Campaign" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="134" data-playlist="196049,196653,195371" data-current="196049"><div><p>This Modern Warfare 3 Gameplay Feature Spices Up A Weak Campaign</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196049/196049_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196049/196049_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196049/196049_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196049/196049_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/21580.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>It’s a lot, especially when all crammed onto a single roadmap. <em>Black Ops 6 </em>Season 01 will go live on Thursday, November 14 at 12:00 p.m. ET across PlayStation 5, PS4, Xbox Series X/S, Xbox One, and PC. In addition to the multiplayer, zombies, and Warzone content and changes coming, the seasonal update also features skins for the operator Sevati “Sev” Dumas, as well as revised battle pass with both free and premium unlocks. It is by far the most complex and overwhelming battle pass I have ever seen. </p><p>Here is a top-line overview of <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.callofduty.com/blog/2024/11/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-season-one-mp-zombies-maps-modes-announcement#Control&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.callofduty.com/blog/2024/11/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-season-one-mp-zombies-maps-modes-announcement#Control" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">everything coming to <em>Black Ops 6 </em>in season 1</a></span>:</p><blockquote data-type="BlockQuote"><p><strong>Maps</strong></p><ul data-type="List" data-style="Bullet"><li>﻿Hideout<br></li><li>Extraction </li><li>Heirloom</li><li>Racket (in-season)</li><li>Hacienda (in-season)</li><li>Nuketown Holiday (in-season)</li></ul><p><strong>Modes</strong></p><ul data-type="List" data-style="Bullet"><li>Ransack</li><li>Prop Hunt</li><li>Multiplayer Ranked Play</li></ul><p><strong>Gameplay</strong></p><ul data-type="List" data-style="Bullet"><li>Hand Cannon Scorestreak</li><li>Shadow Perk</li><li>High Roller Wildcard</li></ul><p><strong>Zombies</strong></p><ul data-type="List" data-style="Bullet"><li>Terminus (directed mode)</li><li>Liberty Falls (directed mode)</li><li>3 New Gobblegums</li><li>Citadelle Des Morts map (in-season)</li></ul><p><strong><em>Call of Duty: Warzone</em></strong></p><ul data-type="List" data-style="Bullet"><li>Maps: Area 99 (Resurgence), Urzikistan, and Rebirth Island</li><li>Gameplay: Omnimovement, BO6 Weapons, Equipment, and Perks, Prestige System, Body Shield, Dedicated Melee, Emotes &amp; Sprays, Streamlined Inventory, Mastery Camo, Killstreaks, and Wildcards</li></ul><p><strong>Weapons</strong></p><ul data-type="List" data-style="Bullet"><li>Krig C (Battle Pass AR)</li><li>Buffer Weight Stock (Attachment)</li><li>Dragon’s Breath (Attachment)</li><li>AMR Mod 4 (In-Season Event Sniper Rifle)</li><li>Cleaver (In-Season Event Melee)</li><li>Maelstrom (Event Shotgun)</li><li>Power Drill (Event Melee)</li><li>Sirin 9MM (Event Special)</li><li>Saug (Batatle Pass SMG)</li></ul><p><strong>Misc.</strong></p><ul data-type="List" data-style="Bullet"><li>Sevati “Sev” Dumas Tier 100 operator</li><li>Brightmare Bundle</li><li>Tracer Pack: The Replacer</li><li>Golaith with Companion Finishing Move</li></ul></blockquote><p>Like I said, that’s a lot! Directed Mode is a notable addition for Zombies that will take players on a more guided tour through the wave-based mode’s story beats and objectives. Then, throughout the season, Zombies will get additional content, including a new Perk-A-Cola, Field Upgrade, Ammo Mod, and 18 more Augments to research. It sounds like most of that stuff won’t be hitting until mid-December at the earliest. </p><p>In the meantime, the update to<em> Call of Duty: Warzone</em> that integrates it with <em>Black Ops 6</em> will be the biggie. The free-to-play battle royale spin-off will be incorporating the ominimovement gameplay of the latest entry in the series, as well as bringing over all of its weapons, skins, and other knickknacks. The season 1 battle pass is $10 and includes a series of instant reward unlocks, including the pink-haired operator Sev as well as a helpful XP boost. </p><p><em>Black Ops 6</em> is currently part of Game Pass on Xbox Series X/S and PC. It’s a good deal for those who like to dive in for a month or two before moving on, though died-in-the-wool COD lifers are still better off buying the whole package upfront. For those still on the fence, however,  Treyarch associate creative director Miles Leslie <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cev90rmyel2o&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cev90rmyel2o" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">has said</a></span> Microsoft’s Netflix-like subscription service has helped get more people playing <em>Black Ops 6</em> than ever before. </p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

The sequel hasn’t panned out the way Blizzard promised after it reportedly canceled the story campaign that was the whole point of a sequel. So it’s easy to look at all the changes <em>Overwatch 2 </em>has implemented and wish we could just go back to the original game. Well, it looks like Blizzard might be teasing something that will poke at the yearning veteran fans are feeling, as a rebrand of its socials has fans wondering if something like a “Classic” <em>Overwatch </em>might be in the works.</p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="196880" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="Ranking Overwatch 2 Season 10's Biggest Changes" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="218" data-playlist="196880,195460,196049" data-current="196880"><div><p>Ranking Overwatch 2 Season 10's Biggest Changes</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196880/196880_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196880/196880_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196880/196880_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196880/196880_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/22434.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>It all started today, November 8, when the <em>Overwatch </em><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://x.com/PlayOverwatch&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://x.com/PlayOverwatch" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">social channels</a></span> were updated with images spotlighting poster girl Tracer in her original game design, rather than the updated look she dons in the sequel. This was accompanied by a <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://x.com/PlayOverwatch/status/1854569505822756915&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://x.com/PlayOverwatch/status/1854569505822756915" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">series of posts highlighting different events in the last eight years</a></span> since <em>Overwatch </em>launched in 2016, as well as a new trailer set to premiere on Monday, November 11, at noon Eastern. The trailer itself includes the old school Tracer art as the thumbnail, but is otherwise pretty nondescript.</p><p>It’s unclear if this might be a proper <em>Overwatch Classic </em>similar to the <em>World of Warcraft Classic </em>Blizzard released in 2019 that brought the MMORPG back to basics or if this is in reference to the previously announced <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/overwatch-2-6v6-test-season-14-open-role-queue-date-1851680742&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/overwatch-2-6v6-test-season-14-open-role-queue-date-1851680742">6v6 test</a></span> that will allow players to engage in 12-player matches like they did before <em>Overwatch 2</em>’s release. If it’s the latter, it seems a little soon considering those tests aren’t set to begin until Season 14, which begins in December. But whatever’s going on, this mystery trailer seems to be about something old becoming new again.</p><p>Will reverting back to 6v6 put <em>Overwatch 2</em> in fans’ good graces again? Part of me wonders if the stink has just gotten too potent for some people to ever come back and stay for an extended period of time. But I’ll take anything that makes the game feel fresh again <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/overwatch-2-sombra-season-13-patch-notes-ramattra-1851673081&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/overwatch-2-sombra-season-13-patch-notes-ramattra-1851673081">instead of a giant bummer</a></span>.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
