              <p>The Nintendo Switch <a href="https://kotaku.com/nintendo-switch-2-launch-zelda-botw-anniversary-1851767489">is over eight years old</a>. It’s never seen a price cut during that time. And now it’s actually about to get <em>more</em> expensive. On Friday, the<em> Mario</em> maker warned customers that the older gaming consoles and their accessories will see price changes in the U.S. “based on market conditions.”</p> <p>Video game consoles are supposed to get cheaper as time goes on, but this console generation has bucked that trend entirely. <a href="https://kotaku.com/microsoft-xbox-series-x-s-price-increase-may-2025-1851778615">The PS5 and Xbox Series X/S</a> are all more expensive now than when they launched, and the Switch is about to join them. And update on Nintendo’s website says the Switch ($300), Switch Lite ($200), and Switch OLED ($350) will all be impacted, but the Switch 2 ($450) will remain unchanged for now. Here’s the full statement:</p> <div> <blockquote> <p>Pricing for the original&nbsp;<span>Nintendo Switch</span>&nbsp;family of systems and products will change in the United States based on market conditions, effective August 3, 2025. These include Nintendo Switch – OLED Model, Nintendo Switch, Nintendo Switch Lite and select Nintendo Switch accessories.</p> </blockquote> </div> <blockquote> <p>Other Nintendo products, including certain Nintendo Switch 2 accessories, select amiibo, and the Nintendo Sound Clock: Alarmo, will also see adjustments.</p> </blockquote> <div> <blockquote> <p>Pricing for the&nbsp;<span>Nintendo Switch 2</span>&nbsp;system, physical and digital Nintendo Switch and Nintendo Switch 2 games, as well as Nintendo Switch Online memberships, will remain unchanged at this time. However, please note that price adjustments may be necessary in the future.</p> </blockquote> </div> <p>Nintendo isn’t revealing what the actual price changes are yet. It’s also not blaming <a href="https://kotaku.com/switch-2-ps5-pro-game-console-prices-tariffs-report-1851779765">President Trump’s trade war</a> directly, but increased tariffs on imports into the U.S. are no doubt partly to blame. Depending on just how much more expensive the old Switch consoles become, it could make upgrading to the Switch 2 instead that much more appealing this fall. At least until that also gets more expensive. The company makes clear that more “price adjustments,” i.e. “price increases,” are on the table moving forward.</p>
