Generally, I haven’t paid too much attention to the developing story of Musk reportedly <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/elon-musk-poe2-diablo-4-paid-boosting-fake-controversy-1851743670&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/elon-musk-poe2-diablo-4-paid-boosting-fake-controversy-1851743670">paying people to juice his <em>Path of Exile </em>account</a></span> and having a <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/elon-musk-elden-ring-mage-worst-magic-build-twitter-bil-1848912000&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/elon-musk-elden-ring-mage-worst-magic-build-twitter-bil-1848912000">terrible build in <em>Elden Ring</em></a></span>. However, now that it has intersected with <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/overwatch-2-emre-sarioglu-freja-animated-trailer-who-is-1851771309&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/overwatch-2-emre-sarioglu-freja-animated-trailer-who-is-1851771309"><em>Overwatch</em></a></span>, a game that I have spent an ungodly amount of time playing, I have more context to understand that Musk is bad at video games, and it’s all thanks to a story from his estranged daughter, Vivian Wilson.</p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="195460" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="Overwatch 2's New Story Missions: Worth The Money?" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="122" data-playlist="195460,196880,195624" data-current="195460"><div><p>Overwatch 2's New Story Missions: Worth The Money?</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195460/195460_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195460/195460_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195460/195460_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195460/195460_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/20938.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>Wilson made an appearance on Twitch streamer and political commentator Hasan Piker’s channel March 29, and along with talking about the difficulties of growing up as Musk’s daughter, her gender transition, and the current political climate, she also talked about how her dad was a Bronze-ranked Torbjörn main in <em>Overwatch</em> who relied on his children’s skill to carry him in ranked.</p><p>“I can expose something that I think is really fucking funny,” Wilson said on the stream. “When I was like 12, he was Bronze in <em>Overwatch,</em> and me and my twin weren’t, and he would try to constantly get us to play ranked with him. I’m 90 percent sure it was just because we could carry him. I was like a 12-year-old Hanzo main who was barely in Silver. He was a Bronze Torbjörn main. He was fucking dogshit. Awful. Like, godawful. So no, I don’t believe the fucking- ‘I am a pro <em>Path of Exile</em> whatever the fuck.’ Like, no the fuck you are not. This is so cringe. Why would you even pretend to be? It’s fine not to be a gamer.”</p><p>The Bronze ranking is funny enough on its own, but the revelation that he was having such a hard time climbing the ranks as Torbjörn, arguably one of the lower-skill heroes on the roster, is also pretty good. However, nothing beats knowing he had to force pre-teens to help him climb out of the Bronze hole into the illustrious ranks of…Silver.</p><p>All of this comes after years of Musk trying to position himself as a pro-level gamer in games like <em>Path of Exile 2 </em>and <em>Diablo IV</em>, seemingly in an attempt to buy credibility in the eyes of nerd followers who will stroke his ego on X and elsewhere. As his business ventures have grown over the years, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/elon-musk-asmongold-poe-2-account-boosting-controversy-1851741223&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/elon-musk-asmongold-poe-2-account-boosting-controversy-1851741223">people have become increasingly skeptical of his claims</a></span> because one person running half a dozen companies likely doesn’t have time to be sinking hundreds of hours into grinding away at video games. Now we have another story to add to the fake gamer saga, and the evidence is really piling up. I don’t care that Musk might not be good at video games, but it’s pretty funny that he’s so desperate for people to think he is.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

It’s an incredible game for one. It was also the last entry on PS1, and the last before the series moved to a full 3D look and voice acting on the PS2. Most importantly, it was the last produced by creator Hironobu Sakaguchi before he left Square, and harkens back to the franchise’s more traditional, medieval roots. Also it features an adorable black mage named Vivi. </p><p>In the past, <em>Final Fantasy XIV</em> producer Naoki Yoshida has been coy about the rumors. “Of course, I do know there are requests for<em> Final Fantasy IX</em> to be made, but when you think about <em>Final Fantasy IX</em>, it’s a game with huge volume,” <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.ign.com/articles/yoshi-p-thinks-a-final-fantasy-9-remake-would-take-more-than-one-game&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/yoshi-p-thinks-a-final-fantasy-9-remake-would-take-more-than-one-game" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">he said last fall</a></span>, appearing to pour cold water on the rumors. “When you think about all of that volume, I wonder if it’s possible to remake that as a single title. It’s a difficult one. It is a tough question.”</p><p>July 7 will be exactly 25 years since the game shipped and Square Enix hints that fans should expect to hear more announcements leading up to it. Maybe a sneak peek of the game itself at an upcoming PlayStation or Summer Game Fest showcase will be one of them.

Will you remain friends or fall in love? Or dismantle and eat them...🍴 Your dream school romance starts here in this <em>Palworld </em>dating sim!”</p><p>Say hello to Splatterina (“I’m good with crafts and medicines”), Nurse Saya (“Huh? No drinking at school...? Don’t be so uptight”), and Katress (“You won’t be able to take your eyes off me”). There’s no release date yet but the Steam page lists a whopping requirement of  4 MB available space. </p><p>The dating sim was first mentioned last April Fools’ day, just a couple months after <em>Palworld</em> had blown up on Steam and Xbox Game Pass. It leaned into the base game’s mix of cuteness—adorable Pokémon knock-off creatures—and depravity—forced labor camps—to suggest a romantic spin-off that would turn taboos into memes. Some players claimed to be disappointed that <em>Pal♡world! ~More Than Just Pals~</em> wasn’t actually real. The Pal’s paw might have just curled to grant their  wish. <br></p><p>“Not again this  april joke feels sad,” <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://x.com/Palworld_EN/status/1906687045130653704&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://x.com/Palworld_EN/status/1906687045130653704" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">wrote</a></span> one person on X. “April joke?
