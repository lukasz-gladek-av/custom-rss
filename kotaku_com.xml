              <p>A Florida woman, who games under the name Legi0n, recently won a local&nbsp;<em>Mortal Kombat</em> tournament, taking home a prize pool of $28. That might not seem a particularly noteworthy incident, until you learn she achieved this with a five-day-old baby sleeping in her arms.</p> <p>As <a href="https://www.dexerto.com/mortal-kombat/florida-woman-wins-mortal-kombat-tournament-playing-with-newborn-baby-in-arms-3259005/">superbly reported by Virginia Glaze at <em>Dexerto</em></a>, the Juicy Game Night of Orlando Florida offers a range of fighting game tournaments for locals to take part in, within which was a <a href="https://www.start.gg/tournament/juicy-monthly-september-27th-2025/event/mortal-kombat-xl/brackets/2029391/2971575">four-person bracket</a>, competing to be the best of a very small bunch at <em>Mortal Kombat XL.</em> But what caused this to become a viral sensation was that the winner, Legi0n, was caring for her newborn baby at the time.</p> <p>You might see this as impressive, simply for the extra complication of having a whole other human being sleeping on you as you attempt to play an aggressive, competitive fighting game, and yes, it certainly is. But what is more mindblowing is that Legi0n had had a cesarean section just five days earlier, following a complicated end to the pregnancy. Honestly, it’s beyond belief she was out of bed, let alone owning at <em>MKXL</em>.</p>

 <p>It took me and my wife a full week before we were even able to get our shit together to the level of being able to leave the house, and then it was to stumble into a local coffee shop, our lower eyelids scraping on the ground, as we stared zombie-like at each other for the seventeen minutes he stayed asleep. And that was without a c-section, which I’m pretty sure is supposed to have you laid up in hospital for a good few days on its own. This person is <em>extraordinary</em>.</p>

 <p>“I only won because she coached me mid set,” <a href="https://x.com/_Legi0n_/status/1972110483789627805">Legi0n posted to her X account</a>, along with the cutest picture of her baby sleeping next to a piece of paper bearing the legend, “<em>Mortal Kombat</em>, 1st Place, $28.”</p> <p>“Sending our daughter to Dreamhack,” she continues, her prize including tickets to the event.</p>

 <p>The Juicy Game Night turns out to be where Legi0n met her husband, whom she beat during the same <em>Mortal Kombat</em> tournament she won this weekend.</p> <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">One of my buddies/long time rivals of mine were just happy to have an excuse to boot up the game. <br>You guys should check out his event <a href="https://twitter.com/CFFOSeries?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@CFFOSeries</a> and other local events from <a href="https://twitter.com/JuicyGameNight?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@JuicyGameNight</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/RetroRevivalFGC?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@RetroRevivalFGC</a>.

During her pregnancy with that daughter, she had played a lot of&nbsp;<em>Street Fighter 6</em>, meaning the game had become inextricably linked with Alcina and obviously too hard to continue to play.</p>

 <p>Their new daughter, Cereza, seems destined to be a&nbsp;<em>Mortal Kombat&nbsp;</em>girl. And her mom is, genuinely, such an inspiration. Not because she won a local fighting game tourney, but because reading through her socials, I want her to be my therapist.</p>

 <p>“I just want people to feel like no matter what they can do things that they still love even if it’s in small chunks,” <a href="https://x.com/_Legi0n_/status/1972114768849781231">she posted to X on September 28</a>. “Never feel like it isn’t worth it. I also want to be very vocal about how serious pregnancy and childbirth as a whole is. You can literally die and I almost did. Twice.”</p> <p>Also, I just want to embed this post because it’s the best damn thing:</p> <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">Also lmao at any butthurt men commenting negatively towards me living my life. I held down my hobbies, had a career level job in stem/tech as in 3D sim work, traveled frequently and entered or placed at different games in different locals or regionals over the years while doing…</p> <p>— Goonz | ♛𝕷𝖊𝖌𝖎0̷𝖓♛ ☕{@ motherhood} (@_Legi0n_) <a href="https://twitter.com/_Legi0n_/status/1972375879226683864?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">September 28, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <p>I (now) fondly remember the very difficult early days of having a baby who would only sleep while being held, doing the 1 a.m. to 6 a.m. shift while my wife tried to sleep, playing video games with the kid nestled between my arms on the desk in front of me. I could manage low-key RPGs at the very most, my all-consuming tiredness removing any hope of coordination. And—key information here—I personally had taken only a minor side-role in act of giving birth. So the maddest of props to Legi0n, my new gaming hero: I wish her all the rest it’s possible to get.</p>
