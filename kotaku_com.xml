Instead, the team’s goal is to remaster the entire game and every asset in it. And so far, it’s looking really good. </p><p>In a new behind-the-scenes trailer released on November 14, Nvidia sat down with some of the modders working on<em> Half-Life 2 RTX </em>and let them talk about why they are remastering this game and what it means to them 20 years later. (Yeah, <em>Half-Life 2</em> turns 20 on November 16.) And in the new trailer, we see a lot of <em>HL2 RTX</em> in action and it looks phenomenal. </p><p>The team’s goal isn’t to change how <em>Half-Life 2</em> plays, but instead to add a new coat of paint to the old shooter to make it look better than ever. This means remaking many props and assets to be higher quality, replacing textures with new ones that react properly to lights, and much, much more. It’s honestly one of the best looking remasters I’ve ever seen. </p><p>Nvidia says <em>Half-Life 2 RTX </em>is still in early development, so no idea when we’ll get a chance to play this mod. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://store.steampowered.com/app/2477290/HalfLife_2_RTX/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2477290/HalfLife_2_RTX/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">You can now find a new Steam page</a></span> for the mod on Valve’s storefront, which shows that while Valve isn’t officially involved, they are cool with the project.

And even though all of its many currencies and systems can make for a confusing impression, it didn’t take long for players to figure out metas. And now we can share that information with you! From the three available booster packs from the launch period of the new expansion, we’ve put together a ranking of the top eleven cards.</p><p><strong>Read More:</strong> <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/pokemon-tcg-pocket-guide-how-to-get-cards-1851689908&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-tcg-pocket-guide-how-to-get-cards-1851689908"><em>Pokémon TCG Pocket</em> Can Be Deeply Confusing At First, So Here Are The Basics</a></span></p><p>This list will be based specifically on cards from the initial expansion. We won’t be including any limited-time promo cards, although we will give a special shout-out to the Lapras ex card. If you’re interested in what to look out for from <em>Genetic Apex</em>, these are the best cards you can pull.</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="ca227c54539c92844afe0e9015d583a0" data-recommend-id="image://ca227c54539c92844afe0e9015d583a0" data-format="jpg" data-width="1080" data-height="608" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="The Alakazam card, showing the Pokémon focusing." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="The Alakazam card, showing the Pokémon focusing." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Nintendo / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="ca227c54539c92844afe0e9015d583a0" data-recommend-id="image://ca227c54539c92844afe0e9015d583a0" data-format="jpg" data-width="1080" data-height="608" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="The Alakazam card, showing the Pokémon focusing." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>Under the right circumstances, Alakazam will hit like a truck. His Psychic attack does 60 base damage plus an additional 30 damage for each energy attached to your opponent’s active Pokémon. Considering that most ex Pokémon require three or four energy to use a strong attack, Alakazam can easily dish out 150 or 180 damage.</p><p>The biggest detriment is that he will require quite a bit of work. You’ll need to evolve an Abra and then evolve a Kadabra before you can get this guy on the field. It’s a great idea to set up Alakazam on your bench while using other Pokémon in the active spot. On the other hand, it’s a bad start if you have to <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/pokemon-tcg-pocket-battles-first-turn-rules-energy-1851693195&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-tcg-pocket-battles-first-turn-rules-energy-1851693195">go first</a></span> and put an Abra in the active spot.</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="34998c0e96def2b970de9d3f27a4d9d2" data-recommend-id="image://34998c0e96def2b970de9d3f27a4d9d2" data-format="jpg" data-width="1080" data-height="608" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Gengar smiles deviously in the Gengar ex card." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Gengar smiles deviously in the Gengar ex card." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Nintendo / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="34998c0e96def2b970de9d3f27a4d9d2" data-recommend-id="image://34998c0e96def2b970de9d3f27a4d9d2" data-format="jpg" data-width="1080" data-height="608" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Gengar smiles deviously in the Gengar ex card." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>One of the more unique utility Pokémon to use is Gengar ex. The 170 HP and 100 damage attack certainly help it stand out, but its best contribution will be the Shadowy Spellbind ability. It’s only active when Gengar ex is in the active spot, but it stops your opponent from using Supporter cards. This is a great way to stop an enemy from powering up their Pokémon or from messing with yours.</p><p>Just like Alakazam, an issue here is that Gengar ex is a stage two Pokémon. You will need to evolve two times to bring it out. There is also an inherent risk as an ex card, since it could cost you two points if it’s knocked out. Charizard ex or even Gyarados can spell trouble against this troublemaker ghost.</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="866665fe55e9cae83326e6f7bb65ea2e" data-recommend-id="image://866665fe55e9cae83326e6f7bb65ea2e" data-format="jpg" data-width="1080" data-height="608" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="The Pidgeot card shows the bird grabbing hold of a Magikarp." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="The Pidgeot card shows the bird grabbing hold of a Magikarp." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Nintendo / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="866665fe55e9cae83326e6f7bb65ea2e" data-recommend-id="image://866665fe55e9cae83326e6f7bb65ea2e" data-format="jpg" data-width="1080" data-height="608" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="The Pidgeot card shows the bird grabbing hold of a Magikarp." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>Next is another fantastic utility Pokémon. Pidgeot can use its Drive Off ability once per turn to switch out your opponent’s active Pokémon to the bench. It’s like a Sabrina card you can use every turn! Best of all, it can do all this from the bench.</p><p>You might notice the pattern, but Pidgeot can take a while to come out since you’ll need to evolve a Pidgey and Pidgeotto. The only other concern is that its Wing Attack dealing 70 damage is kind of just okay. Thankfully, that is balanced out by a lax two-energy requirement.</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="3dee6dc1c29c483347240755e2267296" data-recommend-id="image://3dee6dc1c29c483347240755e2267296" data-format="jpg" data-width="1080" data-height="608" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="The Misty Supporter card shows the eponymous Water trainer confidently posing." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="The Misty Supporter card shows the eponymous Water trainer confidently posing." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Nintendo / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="3dee6dc1c29c483347240755e2267296" data-recommend-id="image://3dee6dc1c29c483347240755e2267296" data-format="jpg" data-width="1080" data-height="608" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="The Misty Supporter card shows the eponymous Water trainer confidently posing." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>That brings us to the first Supporter card on the list, and naturally, it’s Misty. This must-have for Water-type decks relies entirely on luck. You select one Water Pokémon and then keep flipping coins until you flip tails. The Pokémon will gain one energy for each time the coin flips heads.</p><p>A match’s momentum can easily switch when this card is used. Being able to fully load up a strong Water Pokémon that didn’t have any energy before is a huge game-changer. Conversely, immediately flipping tails will make this the biggest waste of a Supporter card. The sheer impact it can have cements it a spot on this list.</p><p>It also has an unproven, but certainly real bug where every time I use it I’ll only flip one head, but my opponents will get at least three when they use it. They really need to fix that.</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="0b44846aba4dd77cc0ec25f3d9b87e68" data-recommend-id="image://0b44846aba4dd77cc0ec25f3d9b87e68" data-format="jpg" data-width="1080" data-height="608" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="A large blue bird flies out of the borders of the Articuno ex card." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A large blue bird flies out of the borders of the Articuno ex card." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Nintendo / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="0b44846aba4dd77cc0ec25f3d9b87e68" data-recommend-id="image://0b44846aba4dd77cc0ec25f3d9b87e68" data-format="jpg" data-width="1080" data-height="608" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="A large blue bird flies out of the borders of the Articuno ex card." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>Speaking of strong Water-types, you can’t mention the best without including Articuno ex. A basic ex Pokémon has plenty of potential and this Legendary easily proves that. Its Blizzard attack deals 80 damage but also has the benefit of inflicting 10 damage to your opponent’s benched Pokémon. </p><p>Aside from the risk of your opponent gaining two points if it’s knocked out, the only other problem is that it takes three energy to use Blizzard. Articuno ex can make up for that with a 40-damage Ice Wing attack that only requires two energy.</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="19661a6ed0e69238211d497857c1f460" data-recommend-id="image://19661a6ed0e69238211d497857c1f460" data-format="jpg" data-width="1080" data-height="608" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="The yellow electric mouse jumps out of the Pikachu ex card." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="The yellow electric mouse jumps out of the Pikachu ex card." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Nintendo / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="19661a6ed0e69238211d497857c1f460" data-recommend-id="image://19661a6ed0e69238211d497857c1f460" data-format="jpg" data-width="1080" data-height="608" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="The yellow electric mouse jumps out of the Pikachu ex card." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>The face of the brand earns a spot here as well. Pikachu ex has access to the powerful Circle Circuit attack, which does 30 damage for every Lightning-type Pokémon on your bench. A full bench can output 90 damage as long as they’re all the correct type.</p><p>There isn’t much too much to complain about here. Circle Circuit can deal a lot of damage for just two energy. What prevents this from landing higher is that it’s entirely dependent on your bench, and 120 HP isn’t great for an ex card that can’t promise consistent damage.</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="86808c5c23a97d5bcbf6ba64d037202a" data-recommend-id="image://86808c5c23a97d5bcbf6ba64d037202a" data-format="jpg" data-width="1080" data-height="608" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Professor Oak waves in the Professor’s Research card." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Professor Oak waves in the Professor’s Research card." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Nintendo / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="86808c5c23a97d5bcbf6ba64d037202a" data-recommend-id="image://86808c5c23a97d5bcbf6ba64d037202a" data-format="jpg" data-width="1080" data-height="608" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Professor Oak waves in the Professor’s Research card." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>Professor’s Research might be on the most basic cards, but it’s invaluable no matter the deck. Playing it allows you to draw two cards to add to your hand. These 20-card decks aren’t big by any means, but there are still times when you’re not drawing what you need. This has a great chance of giving you the right card(s) or at least milling out the deck to get them sooner.</p><p>I can’t imagine putting together any deck without including this in there. Whether you play it at the beginning of a match to give yourself an advantage or use it in the climactic final turns, the card is great. </p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="6503029f5ba1db3b15a0f4a1f8a648c3" data-recommend-id="image://6503029f5ba1db3b15a0f4a1f8a648c3" data-format="jpg" data-width="1080" data-height="608" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="The Charizard ex card shows the Pokémon posing with their wings outstretched." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="The Charizard ex card shows the Pokémon posing with their wings outstretched." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Nintendo / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="6503029f5ba1db3b15a0f4a1f8a648c3" data-recommend-id="image://6503029f5ba1db3b15a0f4a1f8a648c3" data-format="jpg" data-width="1080" data-height="608" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="The Charizard ex card shows the Pokémon posing with their wings outstretched." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>Everyone’s favorite dragon-but-not-a-dragon-type creates a big presence when played on the field. Charizard ex has a tanky 180 HP and both a three-energy Slash attack and a four-energy Crimson Storm. The former deals a modest 60 damage while the latter inflicts a painful 200 that can beat anything.</p><p>This Fire-type isn’t without its setbacks. Crimson Storm’s four energy requirement is a lot to build up to and it additionally discards two Fire energy to use it. The giant pool of HP and massive damage make this a card still worth playing.</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="bb19415700b667f15d085f4c41645680" data-recommend-id="image://bb19415700b667f15d085f4c41645680" data-format="jpg" data-width="1080" data-height="608" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Sabrina poses with her arm outstretched in her Supporter card." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Sabrina poses with her arm outstretched in her Supporter card." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Nintendo / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="bb19415700b667f15d085f4c41645680" data-recommend-id="image://bb19415700b667f15d085f4c41645680" data-format="jpg" data-width="1080" data-height="608" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Sabrina poses with her arm outstretched in her Supporter card." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>Sabrina is undoubtedly the best Supporter card.

It looks cool and has an awesome movie that can make anyone cry and leave them with deep pondering thoughts. Mewtwo ex is just as beloved here thanks to it being a basic card that can inflict 150 damage with its Psydrive attack. For just two energy, it can also inflict 50 damage using a Psychic Sphere attack.</p><p>Similar to Charizard ex, Mewtwo ex’s strongest attack has the detrimental effect of discarding two Psychic energy to use. That can make Psydrive a less consistent attack to pull off. Still, the 150 damage is great for a Basic Pokémon. As you’ve probably seen, pairing him with a Gardevoir can do wonders thanks to its ability to attach one Psychic energy to the Active Spot card each turn.</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="6e3f5a3fa7f6043f7d0d8441e1c16298" data-recommend-id="image://6e3f5a3fa7f6043f7d0d8441e1c16298" data-format="jpg" data-width="1080" data-height="608" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="A large ten-pointed star Pokémon spins in the Starmie ex card." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A large ten-pointed star Pokémon spins in the Starmie ex card." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Nintendo / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="6e3f5a3fa7f6043f7d0d8441e1c16298" data-recommend-id="image://6e3f5a3fa7f6043f7d0d8441e1c16298" data-format="jpg" data-width="1080" data-height="608" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="A large ten-pointed star Pokémon spins in the Starmie ex card." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>Sitting at the top of this list isn’t a Legendary or something that requires a ton of energy. Starmie ex is a low-risk card that can deal big damage fast, making it a great inclusion for a Water-based deck. Its Hydro Splash attack only needs two energy to deal 90 damage. Another fantastic benefit it has is a zero retreat cost, meaning you can easily swap it out if you’re worried it might get knocked out soon.</p><p>The only barrier with Starmie ex is that you need to evolve a Staryu for it. That isn’t that big of an issue in the grand scheme of things. Hydro Splash is sure to knock out if not take a big chunk from most Pokémon you pit it against. At the same time, 130 HP will help it survive against most attacks thrown at it. Every Water-based deck will be elevated by including or basing itself around a Starmie ex card.</p><hr><p>There is no telling how the metas might change, but for now, these are the best cards by far.

This time around, work-for-hire spriggan Van Arkride is tasked with investigating murders  at the hands of a mysterious red monster in the City of Edith. Despite its familiarity, the setup nevertheless sets the stage for some notable change-ups in combat, returning character cameos, and a narrative time-loop mechanic.</p><p>Let’s take them in order, starting with combat. Players will still largely be working with the same structure and toolset they’re accustomed to, but <em>Daybreak II</em>’s real-time, action-oriented field combat has more options this time around, with party members able to wield Quick Arts outside of  conventional turn-based combat. Once things do switch into turn-based encounters, a new Recast timer prohibits players from spamming S-Crafts back-to-back, a strategy that dominated in the first game.</p><p>  <em>Daybreak II </em>also features a larger cast. There are more playable characters and lots of cameos. The former assassin duo from <em>Trails Into Reverie</em>, Swin and Nadia, will play big roles in the game. Others, like the martial artist Zin Vathek who appeared as far back in the series as <em>Trails in the Sky, </em>will also make appearances, fighting alongside your party for a time when the story deems it appropriate. The callbacks will be a boon for longtime <em>Trails</em> fans but will also potentially make <em>Daybreak II</em> harder to parse than the first game, which in many ways served as the most ideal jumping-on point for newcomers the series has had in years. </p><p>Perhaps most unique to <em>Daybreak II</em> is a time-loop system in which a magic artifact revives the team when they die and lets them pursue an alternate course of action to progress their journey instead. It sounds like this mechanic, which includes a menu screen showing branching story paths, will be purely a narrative device rather than one that impacts gameplay. You’ll still be pursuing every avenue in a somewhat linear fashion, and while time technically resets, your earned XP and treasure chest rewards remain intact between loops. </p><p>But much of the bread and butter of a <em>Trails </em>game is everything you’re doing in-between new dungeons and major story beats. <em>Daybreak II</em>’s European-inspired urban backdrop includes food carts you can buy stuff from and consume to get temporary party buffs, as well as to increase your gourmet rank to unlock new and better foodie benefits. Fishing, cards, cyberhacking, and other minigames <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://store.epicgames.com/en-US/news/trails-through-daybreak-ii-brings-improved-combat-more-perspectives-and-fishing&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://store.epicgames.com/en-US/news/trails-through-daybreak-ii-brings-improved-combat-more-perspectives-and-fishing" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">have also been confirmed</a></span>. And outside of main quests and character side stories, there’s  an optional endless dungeon to grind to your heart’s content. </p><p>Even if <em>Daybreak II </em>seems like mid-arc filler, NIS America rep Alan Costa said its events will be important for later games, including a direct sequel that’s already out in Japan called <em>The Legend of Heroes: Kai no Kiseki</em>. NIS also localizes Nihon Falcom’s other big RPG franchise, <em>Ys</em>, the tenth entry of which just arrived in the West back in September. Costa <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.pcgamer.com/games/rpg/nis-america-says-trails-and-ys-rpg-fans-wont-have-to-wait-so-long-for-future-english-releases-we-want-to-bring-that-timeline-down/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/rpg/nis-america-says-trails-and-ys-rpg-fans-wont-have-to-wait-so-long-for-future-english-releases-we-want-to-bring-that-timeline-down/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">has said</a></span> NIS America is trying to cut down on the time it takes to bring the games overseas without cutting corners or hurting the quality of the translations.</p><p>That doesn’t necessarily mean using AI, however. While Nihon Falcom President Kondo Toshihiro <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.4gamer.net/games/999/G999905/20241009051/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.4gamer.net/games/999/G999905/20241009051/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">appeared bullish</a></span> on the prospects of using improving AI translation capabilities to speed up development and close the gap in global release times for <em>Trails</em> and <em>Ys</em> games, NIS America, which localizes the games for English, isn’t using any AI translation in its pipeline at the moment. </p><p>“We don’t use AI for any forward-facing translations inside of our games,” Costa told <em>Kotaku</em> during the recent preview event. “Anything that Falcom decides to do on their end, obviously we have no insight or oversight or say into that. I don’t believe they used any AI  in the creation of their script for this game, but we didn’t in our use in localizing the title. So all of this is warts and all—hopefully we don’t have too many—this is all done by people.”</p><p>Though <em>Trails Through Daybreak III</em> doesn’t yet have a release date in the U.S., the second game isn’t the only <em>Trials</em> release next year. A remake of the first game in the series, <em>The Legend of Heroes: Trails in the Sky the 1st</em>, is also due out in 2025 on Switch. In addition to updating the 2006 game, it will also finally provide a clear starting point for new players on modern platforms. </p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Whoever comes next will have a tough act to follow, as Shadow’s tease at the end of <em>Sonic the Hedgehog 2 </em>was a huge moment for the live-action movies that had fans popping off in the theater. Who do we think is most likely to be burdened with this heavy responsibility? Will it be the next villain, or could it be a new ally for Sonic and his friends? I rounded up characters I think have an actual shot—even a very small one— at showing up at some point in <em>Sonic 3</em>, and am ranking them based on how likely I think they are to be the featured reveal in the big post-credits stinger.</p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="42be7cd9db584c899e8371e3f2392313" data-recommend-id="image://42be7cd9db584c899e8371e3f2392313" data-format="jpg" data-width="757" data-height="657" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="A render of Big waving." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A render of Big waving." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Sega</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="42be7cd9db584c899e8371e3f2392313" data-recommend-id="image://42be7cd9db584c899e8371e3f2392313" data-format="jpg" data-width="757" data-height="657" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="A render of Big waving." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Look, it would be a good bit. Big the Cat, the lovable oaf who debuted in <em>Sonic Adventure</em>, is beloved by fans despite mostly being a joke character in recent years. While he’s not often a playable fixture in the series, Big has been surprisingly present in several big games, to the point where I feel like he will probably show up somewhere down the line if the <em>Sonic </em>live-action universe continues to draw in ticket sales. I can already envision a scene in which Big is running around, chasing his slippery sidekick Froggy through the wreckage of whatever destruction Shadow creates in <em>Sonic 3</em>. Will it actually happen? No chance. That’s why Big is kicking off this list as the least likely hero to show up in <em>Sonic 3</em>.</p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="988dc5e5b9de95ffcef3f7f5c75c21ab" data-recommend-id="image://988dc5e5b9de95ffcef3f7f5c75c21ab" data-format="jpg" data-width="528" data-height="516" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Renders of Espio, Charmy, and Vector." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Renders of Espio, Charmy, and Vector." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Sega</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="988dc5e5b9de95ffcef3f7f5c75c21ab" data-recommend-id="image://988dc5e5b9de95ffcef3f7f5c75c21ab" data-format="jpg" data-width="528" data-height="516" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Renders of Espio, Charmy, and Vector." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Did you know the detective agency trio of Vector the Crocodile, Espio the Chameleon, and Charmy Bee already exists in the live-action <em>Sonic </em>universe?

Whether that’s <em>Sonic 4</em> or another movie down the line, Chaos is the kind of world-ending threat that these movies seem to be leading toward as they escalate and raise the stakes each time. However, I do think these movies need a marketable face to tease what’s next, and that’s why Tails and Shadow’s appearances at the end of the first two movies made sense. They were both well-known characters that you could see facilitating merchandise like figures and plushies. Chaos is exciting to long-time <em>Sonic </em>fans and I would love to see him flood a city and Sonic make some joke about how the team is “gonna need a bigger boat,” but as a post-credits stinger?

If you’ve played <em>Sonic Adventure 2</em>, you know how that story ends for Shadow: he falls to Earth from space, is presumed dead, and then is found by Eggman for his own experiments. If Shadow meets a similar fate at the end of <em>Sonic 3</em>, a robot is going to probably have to find him, right? Who better than his future teammate?</p><p>Come on, Paramount.

Silver the Hedgehog, the time-traveling telekinetic hero from the future, seems like a shoo-in for a future <em>Sonic</em> live-action movie. If he does show up, I can’t imagine him not being accompanied by Blaze the Cat, his companion from the future in his debut in <em>Sonic ‘06 </em>(though we’ll ignore the way Sega retconned her origins and decided she’s from another dimension, because we don’t need to make <em>Sonic</em> a multiverse story this early into the cinematic universe). </p><figure id="" data-id="f2a45d21bcd2c3ce46df620d37a14a05" data-recommend-id="image://f2a45d21bcd2c3ce46df620d37a14a05" data-format="jpg" data-width="548" data-height="306" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="A render of Blaze" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A render of Blaze" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Sega</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="f2a45d21bcd2c3ce46df620d37a14a05" data-recommend-id="image://f2a45d21bcd2c3ce46df620d37a14a05" data-format="jpg" data-width="548" data-height="306" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="A render of Blaze" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>I expect this pair to show up in the near future because some of the groundwork has already been laid.

The show made some embellishments to Iblis’ nature, so the next movie probably won’t be a 1:1 recreation of <em>Sonic ‘06</em>, but with both Iblis and Shadow joining the live-action universe this year, Paramount has a lot of the pieces in place to make the next movie a retelling of one of the more controversial games in <em>Sonic</em>’s portfolio. </p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="5cfe400e4114b361c9f5ca05dcdd2380" data-recommend-id="image://5cfe400e4114b361c9f5ca05dcdd2380" data-format="jpg" data-width="842" data-height="473" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="A render of Rouge." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A render of Rouge." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Sega</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="5cfe400e4114b361c9f5ca05dcdd2380" data-recommend-id="image://5cfe400e4114b361c9f5ca05dcdd2380" data-format="jpg" data-width="842" data-height="473" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="A render of Rouge." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>I can’t believe we haven’t seen Rouge the Bat in the live-action <em>Sonic </em>universe yet. Unless Paramount is deliberately hiding her in all the trailers and promotional materials, it doesn’t seem like she’ll be making an appearance in <em>Sonic 3 </em>proper despite it being a loose adaptation of <em>Sonic Adventure 2</em>, which featured the debut of the treasure-hunting spy. I was hopeful she would show up in the <em>Knuckles </em>show since she’s considered the titular Echidna’s rival, but again, that show barely had time for one CG character, much less two. So here we are, with no sign of the leader of Team Dark even after a show and a movie that would have been easy entry points. </p><p>If Rouge isn’t secretly in <em>Sonic 3</em>, I could see her debut in the live-action universe being much like the beginning of Team Dark’s story in <em>Sonic Heroes</em>. She could happen upon Shadow in stasis while looking for treasure in Eggman’s base, then one thing leads to another and the team is formed. Typing that out, I realize it seems like a stronger basis for the opening of the reported Shadow spin-off, but I do think Rouge joining the cinematic universe is a matter of when, not if. In recent games and shows like <em>Sonic Dream Team </em>and <em>Sonic Prime</em>, Rouge has been treated as a friend of Sonic, rather than being more closely tied to Shadow as she has been in most other appearances, so there’s a chance the <em>Sonic </em>movies go that route. That would be incredibly disappointing to me as a Team Dark stan, though, especially after Sega brought the band back together this year in <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/sonic-x-shadow-generations-review-levels-powers-1851676560&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/sonic-x-shadow-generations-review-levels-powers-1851676560"><em>Shadow Generations</em></a></span>.</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="48ab438853dcf84060303a1c895b08db" data-recommend-id="image://48ab438853dcf84060303a1c895b08db" data-format="jpg" data-width="713" data-height="398" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="A render of Amy." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A render of Amy." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Sega</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="48ab438853dcf84060303a1c895b08db" data-recommend-id="image://48ab438853dcf84060303a1c895b08db" data-format="jpg" data-width="713" data-height="398" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="A render of Amy." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>Unlike Tails and Shadow, I don’t see Amy Rose as the kind of character who can kickstart the narrative of a sequel on her own. She’d probably need to be paired with some other character or force in a post-credit scene, but the <em>Sonic </em>movies desperately need her after being a boy’s club for three movies. Amy is often treated as secondary to the main trio of Sonic, Tails, and Knuckles, but she’s ultimately a core part of the heroes’ dynamic and it’s about time she showed up. Paramount has omitted her for so long that I’m not sure how she’ll fit into this storyline, but someone over there needs to figure it out, and sooner rather than later. </p><figure id="" data-id="51cefc75231483be9e6daa86d36d4088" data-recommend-id="image://51cefc75231483be9e6daa86d36d4088" data-format="jpg" data-width="964" data-height="544" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="A render of Cream" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A render of Cream" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Sega</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="51cefc75231483be9e6daa86d36d4088" data-recommend-id="image://51cefc75231483be9e6daa86d36d4088" data-format="jpg" data-width="964" data-height="544" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="A render of Cream" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>If they wanted to get real bold, I could see Cream the Rabbit showing up alongside Amy, making the whole cast of anthropomorphic characters more well-rounded. Either way, I don’t see a version of events in which she shows up without Amy also being there, given the two are considered a pair not unlike Sonic and Tails. It wouldn’t be my ideal choice, but I can also see Paramount trying to package Amy, Cream, and Rouge as a girl-centric group in a call-back to the <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://x.com/mizuhano/status/989669646730067968&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://x.com/mizuhano/status/989669646730067968" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">scrapped <em>Sonic Heroes</em> team</a></span> that would have featured the three of them working together.

I do worry that setting up Metal Sonic as the next movie’s big bad could feel a little samey after Sonic facing an “evil” mirror image of himself in Shadow throughout <em>Sonic 3</em>, but it’s certainly an easier concept to explain in a family film than something like Iblis or Chaos. I hope Paramount swings for the fences and introduces something different in the next movie, but given that there’s already reason to believe Doctor Robotnik might be piecing Metal Sonic together, I fully expect the robot to make his debut in <em>Sonic 3</em>, whether that’s as an eleventh-hour villain or in a post-credits scene. </p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

As one of the first tasks of your adventure, you’ll need to make your way over to Patty’s Party Planning Place to recruit three companions. Whether you choose to take along the premade characters or create your own allies, you’ll see that each character can assume one of eight classes. With no frame of reference for how each class performs, how on earth are you supposed to choose?</p><p>Fortunately, you should know that your choices here aren’t necessarily permanent. <strong><em>Dragon Quest III</em> will eventually let you change each of your companions’ classes later on in your adventure, so your goal here is to pick the classes that will help you early on the most</strong>. In some cases, this may mean taking classes that start strong out the gate. In other cases, you may want to prioritize classes that learn valuable utility skills that the character’s second class can inherit down the line. Either way, you have some flexibility with your picks here.</p><p>To help you decide which classes will serve you best in <em>Dragon Quest III HD-2D Remake</em>, we’ve assembled a tier list that ranks their early game benefits from best to worst. Note that <em>Dragon Quest III HD-2D Remake</em> does feature new mechanics and class changes that change how jobs perform relative to previous versions of the game, so longtime fans can’t necessarily rely on their preexisting knowledge of the game. Also, <strong>please note that this is strictly a tier list of which classes to start with, not each class’s overall performance throughout the game</strong>. Some picks function much better when used as mid-game class changes, and one of the best classes in the game isn’t even available at the start!</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="bb5611116313570c9f74bd03440271eb" data-recommend-id="image://bb5611116313570c9f74bd03440271eb" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="A screenshot from Dragon Quest III HD-2D Remake.

It can inflict decent physical damage, especially since it can equip strong whips that damage entire groups of enemies. Additionally, Monster Tamer learns healing abilities in the form of <strong>Emergency Groom</strong> and <strong>Soothing Song</strong>, which offer single-target and party-wide healing respectively. Not only is this the only source of party-wide healing in the early game of <em>Dragon Quest III</em>, these also work in instances where magic is blocked since they are classified as Abilities. Monster Wrangler doesn’t scale as a healer into the later game, but it fills a powerful niche early on.</p><p>That said, <strong>it’s the new collectible monsters that elevates Monster Wrangler from good to great.</strong> As you explore the world, you’ll find friendly monsters that you can typically recruit by either using the correct item or skill to get them to talk to you. Not only do Monster Wranglers let you automatically catch monsters without fulfilling these prerequisites, collecting a large roster will grant Monster Wranglers new skills as well. This critically includes <strong>Monster Pile-On</strong>, a powerful attack that scales with the total number of monsters you’ve collected. As long as you explore and use the Monster Wrangler’s <strong>Animal Instinct</strong> Ability to track down recruitable monsters, you can easily learn this skill by the time you can change class.</p><p>If you plan to speedrun the game and don’t want to track down monsters, then Monster Wrangler admittedly won’t impress as much. Otherwise, this class covers so many early-game niches and learns such strong Abilities that it will find use in any party you stick it in.</p><h3 id="h554"><a id=""></a><strong>Mage</strong></h3><figure id="" data-id="efa6256e3359251a0234039102710656" data-recommend-id="image://efa6256e3359251a0234039102710656" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="A screenshot from Dragon Quest III HD-2D Remake.

However, <em>Dragon Quest III HD-2D</em> gives all magic users an inadvertent buff, since all level-ups will fully restore that character’s HP and MP. This means Mages can use their most powerful magic with only the slightest restraint in dungeons, since they’ll usually receive full restoration before their MP runs dry. In other words, Mage is easily a top DPS pick and one of the best damage dealers to start out with in <em>Dragon Quest III HD-2D</em></p><p>Even without this boon, Mage would still be a good starting class. It excels at damaging groups of enemies, which you’ll be dealing with way more than single targets. It’s also a great candidate to turn into the mighty Sage class thanks to its naturally high Wisdom and MP stats (see the Gadabout description later on). Mages aren’t quite as useful if you change them to any class that isn’t a magic user, but overall this is an obvious class to pick.</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="45ee390148f929f56bf7ab1878ffb3df" data-recommend-id="image://45ee390148f929f56bf7ab1878ffb3df" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="A screenshot from Dragon Quest III HD-2D Remake.

You can technically cover your healing bases by using your main character and either healing items or the Monster Tamer until you eventually get a Sage in your party. Regardless, if you’re wondering who your third party member should be, I’d suggest “have a little Priest.”</p><p>Starting with a Priest has two huge perks. First, a dedicated healer frees up the rest of your party from healing duty, including your incredibly powerful protagonist. Second, a Priest learns so many helpful support skills in the early game that it’ll make virtually any class it later changes to better. Even a Fighter can function like a <em>Final Fantasy</em>-style Paladin when it can remove a slew of status resistances and provide some backup healing when the chips are down.</p><p>Oh, and Priests can learn some basic attack magic in the form of <strong>Woosh</strong> and <strong>Swoosh</strong>, which it can easily use thanks to the aforementioned full heals on leveling up.</p><p>Do keep in mind that if you insist on using both a Mage and a Priest, you may struggle in instances where magic is sealed or you need to use physical attacks. Still, if you’d like to prioritize survival, definitely pick a Priest starting out.</p><h3 id="h556"><a id=""></a><strong>Martial Artist</strong></h3><figure id="" data-id="a381683b5db76a7044ee989a5dc60c3e" data-recommend-id="image://a381683b5db76a7044ee989a5dc60c3e" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="A screenshot from Dragon Quest III HD-2D Remake.

On one hand, they’re extremely picky with equipment, and they’re literally better off fighting bare-handed in the early game until you can find claws for them to use. On the other hand, this means you don’t need to invest a lot of gold into dressing them and you can focus on the rest of your party without grinding. Additionally, the Martial Artist only learns situationally useful skills in the early game. But despite that, skills like <strong>Flying Knee</strong> and <strong>Hawkeye Claw</strong> will come quite in handy, especially in the dungeons you’ll need to clear before you can unlock class changing.</p><p>There’s honestly not a lot to say about the Martial Artist, as its main function is to just <em>punch</em> nine times out of ten. Still, if you want a dedicated physical attacker on your team, the Martial Artist is a good starting point.</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="9e79133572fc009f3d33177e5b57ed51" data-recommend-id="image://9e79133572fc009f3d33177e5b57ed51" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="A screenshot from Dragon Quest III HD-2D Remake.

It can equip a richer variety of weapons and armor compared to the Martial Artist, but that can put more of a strain on your gold reserves unless you want to forgo loading out your other party members. Its early game skills also aren’t especially impressive, as it takes quite a few levels for it to learn strong physical attacks. The Warrior does technically fulfill a tank role for your party, but frankly the Hero already does an admiral job of filling this void throughout the early game.</p><p>Should you eventually switch one of your classes into a Warrior later on? Sure, it’s a good class! Additionally, if you’re the type of player who always likes to level grind until you get all the best equipment before heading into a dungeon, then the Warrior will likely come out ahead of the Martial Artist. Otherwise, you may want to consider one of the higher-tier options above before picking a Warrior.</p><p>DQ3-Class-Thief.jpg]</p><p>Caption: A screenshot from Dragon Quest III HD-2D Remake.

Its skills <strong>Nose for Treasure</strong> and <strong>Scoop</strong> are <em>invaluable</em> for finding hidden treasure, including the collectible Mini Medals scattered all throughout the game. <em>Several</em> hidden items have literally no visual clue for where they are unless you’re standing on top of them, so the Thief’s skills are essential for completionists. Additionally, <strong>Padfoot</strong> lowers the rate of random battles, which makes several dungeons in the game much more palatable.</p><p>So why not pick a Thief right off the bat? Long story short, it takes them a few levels to get these essential skills, and they are much stronger in battle if you let them inherit skills from another class. If you don’t mind using a weaker class in the early game of <em>Dragon Quest III HD-2D</em> and just want those key skills right away, then you should definitely start with a Thief. But for the smoothest play experience, just make Thief one of your first class changes instead.</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="a4f310c69b8158f253d5544de5ec5891" data-recommend-id="image://a4f310c69b8158f253d5544de5ec5891" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="A screenshot from Dragon Quest III HD-2D Remake.

It <em>is</em> usable, as it can inflict respectable damage and equip some strong weapons. The Merchant also can find extra gold after battles, which can be helpful early on while money is relatively scarce. You can even use the “Show” command with a Merchant in the party, which gives you a full and fun description of every item in the game. It’s a really neat touch!</p><p>The Merchant’s problem is that it offers almost no long-term benefits to your party. Sure, the Show command can let you know if an item is cursed, but that’s usually specified in an item’s description already. The skill <strong>Service Call</strong> technically lets you use Inns on-demand, but it doesn’t work in the dungeons where you’d need it the most. It does learn the powerful attack <strong>Call to Arms</strong>, but this is a later-game move and is functionally identical to the Monster Tamer’s <strong>Monster Pile-On</strong>, which is overall cheaper to use.</p><p>Merchants aren’t bad, and they are fun to use. But of all the classes in <em>Dragon Quest III HD-2D</em>, this is the easiest to skip.</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="ca02f664667e4aabadde07cfdeea5b1a" data-recommend-id="image://ca02f664667e4aabadde07cfdeea5b1a" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="A screenshot from Dragon Quest III HD-2D Remake.

Don’t bother with this until later.</p><h3 id="h560"><a id=""></a><strong>Gadabout</strong></h3><p>Please don’t start with this literal clown emoji of a class. It’s bad enough that Gadabouts learn nothing useful in the early game and contribute less damage than the classes listed above. What’s worse is that Gadabouts will literally waste turns disobeying your commands to instead pull pranks on the battlefield, all of which can stun or weaken your party members. Yes, you read that right: You will encounter instances in which having a Gadabout in your party is actually worse than not having a third party member at all.</p><p>Why does such an awful class exist in <em>Dragon Quest III HD-2D</em> to begin with? Well, if you can pull off leveling a Gadabout high enough, it can learn some useful (albeit often niche) abilities that no other classes can. Additionally, the Gadabout is the only class that can change into the Sage class without consuming the rare Words of Wisdom item. In either case, <strong>the goal with the Gadabout is to have it in your party for the least amount of time possible</strong>. Since EXP scales up sharply as you progress in your adventure, you won’t have to endure using a Gadabout for nearly as long if you save this for a class change later on.</p><p>.</p></div></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
