Not everyone has that sort of time, but it’s an outlook that certainly takes the pressure off of actually feeling like you need to get better or show progress for all those failed attempts.

As a result, I’m very excited to play <em>Bananza</em>. It looks awesome, letting DK punch and destroy everything. It also co-stars a young Pauline, who is DK’s companion in the game, riding on his shoulder and using her singing ability to help the big ape solve puzzles and destroy more stuff. I think that inclusion alone wouldn’t have broken too many people’s brains, but at one point in the Direct we briefly see Donkey Kong and young Pauline interact with Cranky Kong. And that has caused <em>chaos</em> among Nintendo lore nerds.</p><figure id="" data-id="349d77c430ac9deebe35516ebaf943a8" data-recommend-id="image://349d77c430ac9deebe35516ebaf943a8" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Screenshot of YouTube comments debating DK Bananza's place in the lore.

So seeing Pauline as a child hanging out with an aged Cranky Kong makes it hard for wiki editors and super fans to figure out how to connect <em>Bananza </em>to the other <em>Mario </em>and <em>Donkey Kong</em> games.</p><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://youtu.be/YVUidGTR8xg&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://youtu.be/YVUidGTR8xg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Over on YouTube</a></span>, there are literally hundreds of comments from many people debating how to make the lore work. </p><p>Some speculate that <em>Bananza</em> is retconning the original game.

Some <em>DK / Mario</em> purists are denouncing the game as non-canonical. Some think Pauline is actually Pauline’s daughter. Still others are expecting this to be a prequel to <em>Super Mario Odyssey</em>, and it will reveal the origins of New Donk City, where we meet an adult Mayor Pauline. </p><figure id="" data-id="f24fe3227c84434922a4e159de77b53c" data-recommend-id="image://f24fe3227c84434922a4e159de77b53c" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A screenshot shows a huge comment about DK lore.

" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>I found one YouTube comment that was over 1,300 words long and dug deep into the canonical <em>Mario </em>and<em> Donkey Kong</em> games and <em>Bananza’s </em>place in that timeline and the problems it creates.</p><h2 id="h37723"><a id=""></a>How A Young Pauline Can Meet Cranky Kong In <em>Bananza</em></h2><p>I want to help you all. So, here’s the answer you’ve been looking for. Here’s why and how Pauline, as a kid, is talking to Cranky Kong. You ready? Here you go: Nintendo doesn’t care about lore and just wants to make fun games. That’s it. Simple as that. </p><p>And honestly, that’s so nice. I love it so much. Truly, Nintendo devs couldn’t care less about canon, timelines, and <em>Donkey Kong</em> lore. They just make great games that make you smile. The company doesn’t let decades of backstory impede its ability to be creative and do new things. Pauline is a kid in this game because the people making <em>Bananza</em> thought it would be a fun idea, and Nintendo agreed. </p><p>Besides, the <em>Donkey Kong</em> lore is a mess anyway. Cranky Kong’s appearance in the Direct is seen by many as a smoking gun that reveals <em>Bananza</em> to be a reboot or a time travel story. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.mariowiki.com/Cranky_Kong#Identity_confusion:~:text=Rareware%20initially%20created,List%20of%20appearances&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.mariowiki.com/Cranky_Kong#Identity_confusion:~:text=Rareware%20initially%20created,List%20of%20appearances" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">But on the <em>Mario</em> Wiki page for Cranky, you’ll find a nearly 800-word section</a></span> about how his connection to Donkey Kong has never been consistent. Sometimes he’s DK’s grandpa, sometimes he’s DK’s dad, sometimes he might not even be related. Sometimes Nintendo has acknowledged this nonsense; other times, they just treat the current Donkey Kong as the sole big ape that long ago kidnapped Pauline. None of this has <em>ever </em>been nailed down consistently, and acting like it has is silly!</p><p>Look, I get it. I love <em>Star Wars</em> lore. I get nerdy about it, too. I’m not trying to say people can’t have fun. But far too many of the comments I’ve seen about this <em>Bananza</em> lore debate seem to be taking it far too seriously, as if Nintendo is vindictively shitting on Rare’s legacy. That doesn’t make sense considering all the references to Rare’s<em> DK Country </em>games included in the Direct. </p><p>The thing about lore is that it’s fun to ponder and discuss, but it should never be allowed to completely derail anyone’s ability to tell a new story or make something cool with classic characters. <em>Donkey Kong Bananza</em> seems like a blast. Don’t let the lore get in the way of that. </p><p> .</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
