They were nice side dishes but no grilled steak. Everyone appreciates a good potato salad or baked mac, but that’s not why they show up to the BBQ. It has been this way with Xbox for over a decade now. </p><p>There’s no shortage of great games but few are exclusive and none of them—not <em>Forza</em>, not <em>Halo</em>, not <em>Starfield</em>—have popped like the biggest exclusive blockbusters on PS5. Unable to conjure a killer app, it’s tried to buy them, starting with <em>Minecraft</em>, but the result is now that the most compelling parts of Microsoft’s portfolio are all available elsewhere.</p><p>If a family member, friend, or some stranger at GameStop asked me if they should get an Xbox, my answer would look like a spreadsheet full of if/then functions. The value proposition of Game Pass remains strong but increasingly mired in asterisks. Genre diversity abounds and there’s early console access to some of the biggest Steam hits around. There is something for everyone on Xbox if they know how, where, and when to look. My answer for whether to get a PS5 would be much simpler: <em>Horizon Forbidden West</em>,<em> God of War Ragnarok</em>, <em>Spider-Man 2, </em>a dozen remasters of <em>The Last Of Us</em>. </p><p>These are not the types of games everyone buys a $500 machine for, but they are definitely the types of games a particular kind of person might buy a $500 machine for. The type of person who buys relatively few games—a yearly <em>Madden</em> update and the new <em>Grand Theft Auto</em>—but doesn’t really discriminate between genres and has no franchise loyalty. They want the big, cinematic blockbuster with a gameplay hook just meaty enough to be fun but not so complex it starts to feel like work. These are the types of games that <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://deadgame.substack.com/p/unlocking-the-cheat-codes-to-geoff&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://deadgame.substack.com/p/unlocking-the-cheat-codes-to-geoff" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">often win Game of the Year at Geoff Keighley’s Game Awards</a></span>, and they just happen to be the type Sony spent the PS4 generation specializing in. </p><figure id="" data-id="23ed8e3a39523204422d2930f994124a" data-recommend-id="image://23ed8e3a39523204422d2930f994124a" data-format="png" data-width="1269" data-height="706" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Phil Spencer appears on stage at E3 2018.

It was a highlight at the 2024 Xbox summer showcase and now it’s canceled, despite Microsoft studios head Matt Booty <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.axios.com/newsletters/axios-gaming-859a2221-8d0f-4721-935b-0e87638a0280.html&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.axios.com/newsletters/axios-gaming-859a2221-8d0f-4721-935b-0e87638a0280.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">saying he was excited by what he’d played back in 2023</a></span>. A new <em>Fable</em>, first revealed before the Xbox Series X/S launched, remains a year out.</p><p>The Xbox 360 surged to prominence thanks in part to Bungie’s <em>Halo</em> and Epic Games’ <em>Gears of War</em>. Neither franchise has been the same under Microsoft’s in-house teams. That might be part of why the company keeps acquiring new ones rather than trying to build them itself. But the results have been just as uneven. “If that were the only reason for this wave of cancellations and layoffs, it would be a terrible shame, but a rational reality,” <em>Polygon</em>’s Oli Welsh <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.polygon.com/analysis/610779/microsoft-layoffs-perfect-dark-everwild-mismanagement&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.polygon.com/analysis/610779/microsoft-layoffs-perfect-dark-everwild-mismanagement" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">wrote last week</a></span>. “But the darker cloud hanging over the story is that Microsoft has—consistently and repeatedly, over decades—shown it has no aptitude for running the creative industry it just bought half of.”<br></p><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/latest-round-of-mass-layoffs-at-xbox-begin-with-200-job-1851785492&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/latest-round-of-mass-layoffs-at-xbox-begin-with-200-job-1851785492">A year before he began laying off thousands of staff</a></span> across Xbox’s now-sprawling empire of studios and publishers, Phil Spencer suggested Xbox’s fate was set in stone. The Xbox One generation was too disastrous to recover from. Players were now locked in. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/xbox-phil-spencer-interview-starfield-ps5-console-war-1850404446&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/xbox-phil-spencer-interview-starfield-ps5-console-war-1850404446">He called it “[the] worst generation to lose.”</a></span> That logic paved the way for Microsoft’s pivot away from hardware and toward becoming a third-party publishing platform hitched to subscription and cloud gaming. “There is no world where <em>Starfield </em>is an 11/10 and people start selling their PS5s,” he said in 2023.  “That’s not going to happen.” But <em>Starfield</em> wasn’t an 11/10 or even a 9/10, so we’ll never quite know. It was a convenient time for the quality of exclusives to stop mattering. </p><p>Having watched the Switch cruise to being the second best-selling console of all time purely on the back of first-party exclusives like<em> The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild</em>, <em>Animal Crossing: New Horizons</em>, and <em>Mario Kart 8 Deluxe</em>, I’m not convinced that the games don’t matter. When Google shut down its first-party studios in 2021, the developers there asked their boss at the time, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/fairgame-ps5-heist-shooter-haven-jade-raymond-delay-1851780961&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/fairgame-ps5-heist-shooter-haven-jade-raymond-delay-1851780961">Jade Raymond</a></span>, what that meant for the rest of Stadia, the company’s cloud gaming platform. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/gateway/gta-v-pc-next-gen-xbox-ps5-raytracing-update-free-march-1851765673&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/gateway/gta-v-pc-next-gen-xbox-ps5-raytracing-update-free-march-1851765673">According to sources present at the time</a></span>, she said something along the lines of “no gaming platform has ever succeed without strong first-party games.” If you build it, they might come. If you stop, they definitely won’t. </p><p>“I’m proud to introduce the creation of a brand new Microsoft studio, The Initiative, led by Darrell Gallagher, a visionary storyteller who has worked across some of the most iconic franchises for over 20 years,” Spencer said back at E3 2018. “This new Santa Monica studio is building a team of world-class talent to create groundbreaking new game experiences.” It was a play for GOTY blockbusters right in PlayStation’s first-party backyard. The Initiative would have “the resources, the platform, and the creative independence to take bigger risks and create  even bolder worlds.” Apparently the risks were too big and the worlds were taking too long. <br></p><p>.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://kotaku.com/xbox-perfect-dark-halo-gears-war-fable-ps5-1851785732]]></content:encoded>

I’ve only seen it offer one unconnected track at most among the listed choices. Picking Random in an online lobby <em>before</em> the recent update always resulted in a three-lap experience. After the update went live, picking Random now incorporates the chances of getting a connecting track from your current location. We don’t know what the odds are for anything, but most people are seeing the intermission tracks a lot more often.</p><p>I’m of the mindset that the function was likely bugged before. Choosing “Random” to limit the choices down to specifically closed-lap races doesn’t sound right when you think about it. This might be a case of something being fixed at the expense of being less fun. Then again, this game gives you vague settings labeled “Connected” and “Open” so who can say how the hell any of this is meant to work. <strong>For now, your safest bet for racing some simple laps online is to select an unconnected track whenever it’s a choice.</strong> If you don’t like the track or maybe don’t even get an unconnected option, go with random and pray for the best.</p><p><strong>Read More:</strong> <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/mario-kart-world-bowser-jr-wario-waluigi-koopa-shy-boo-1851785552&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/mario-kart-world-bowser-jr-wario-waluigi-koopa-shy-boo-1851785552">Here’s Every <em>Mario </em>Villain Outfit You Can Collect In <em>Mario Kart World</em></a></span></p><p>Here’s hoping that <em>Mario Kart World</em> is updated in the future to make this easier and not more difficult…again.

Sure, before that, Duke had starred in some genuinely good games in the ‘90s, like <em>Duke Nukem 3D</em>. Since then, the famous (?) character has mostly stayed dormant. (<span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://youtu.be/VIZ4v5_j6aE&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://youtu.be/VIZ4v5_j6aE" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">He did appear in a digital pinball table in 2023</a></span>.) But he’s finally back. Not in a new game, oh no, but instead as a sad crossover character in a free-to-play game featuring tanks. </p><p>Over the weekend, <em>World of Tanks</em> announced that Duke Nukem was going to be part of the game’s latest battle pass. They did so with a reveal trailer that harkens back to<em> Duke Nukem 3D</em>. It also features John St. John voicing Duke once more, a role he’s had since 1996. But this time, John barely sounds interested in what he’s reading. It’s the same lines again. At one point, Duke Nukem shouts “Shake it, baby!” at a tank. Mr. Nukem, are you okay? </p><p>Anyway, the new Battle Pass Special: Heroes’ Paths event starts on July 10 in <em>World of Tanks</em> and runs until July 21. Actual video game icon Lara Croft <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://youtu.be/4vpDPWJ9iRo&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://youtu.be/4vpDPWJ9iRo" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">is also part of the new pass</a></span>. Maybe one day her new game from <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/tomb-raider-lara-croft-crystal-dynamics-amazon-games-1849898949&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/tomb-raider-lara-croft-crystal-dynamics-amazon-games-1849898949">Amazon will actually launch</a></span>? </p><p>Neither character makes a physical appearance in the game, as <em>World of Tanks</em> is about giant tanks fighting each other. So don’t expect Duke Nukem running around killing pig cops. Instead, the devs have picked two real-world tanks and modified them to better reflect Duke and Lara. Here’s how the developers describe Duke’s tank:</p><blockquote data-type="BlockQuote"><p>[Duke’s tank is] the <strong>TS-6</strong>,<strong>&nbsp;</strong>a Tier IX U.S. assault heavy tank. A powerhouse of destruction, this tank mirrors Duke’s “all guns blazing” approach. It boasts a custom nuclear reactor, enhanced weapon systems, and aesthetic nods to Duke’s arsenal, including laser machine guns and grenade launchers. The tank’s design draws inspiration from classic Duke Nukem weapons such as the incinerator and fire extinguisher.</p></blockquote><p>No pricing information was included in the press release I received. The Heroes’ Paths battle pass is split into two chapters. One will provide 30 stages for Lara Croft, and the other will feature 40 stages for Duke Nukem. You’ll be able to unlock various cosmetics inspired by each character and their franchises. Hopefully, one of those is a good <em>Duke Nukem</em> game.</p><p> .<br></p></div></div><br/><br/>https://kotaku.com/duke-nukem-world-of-tanks-battle-pass-lara-croft-sad-1851785719]]></content:encoded>

We’ll dive into all these status effects in this guide, so bounce on down below to check it out.</p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="196452" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="Clear Your Calendar For Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="149" data-playlist="196452,196001,195273" data-current="196452"><div><p>Clear Your Calendar For Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196452/196452_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196452/196452_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196452/196452_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196452/196452_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/22004.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><h2 id="h360"><a id="1"></a>All status effects in <em>Bravely Default: Flying Fairy HD</em></h2><h2 id="h361"><a id=""></a></h2><p>Here are the status effects you’ll encounter while playing <em>Bravely Default: Flying Fairy HD</em>. </p><p><strong>Berserk</strong>: This status effect raises a character’s Physical Attack by a whopping 50 percent, but you lose control of them for a while, which means they’ll attack at random. <em>You can cure it with Esuna/Esunaga.</em></p><p><strong>Blind</strong>: This status effect reduces the accuracy of a character’s physical attacks. You can’t hit what you can’t target, you know. <em>Silver Glasses make you immune to this status. You can cure it with Esuna/Esunaga.</em></p><p><strong>Charm</strong>: This status effect removes your ability to control a character temporarily. During this time, they may heal enemies or attack your other characters. <em>Rebuff Locket makes you immune to this status. You can cure it with Esuna/Esunaga.</em></p><p><strong>Confusion</strong>: This status effect removes your ability to control a character temporarily. While under the effect, the character may randomly attack enemies and allies. <em>Peace Ring makes you immune to this status. You can cure it with Esuna/Esunaga.</em></p><p><strong>Death</strong>: This status effect kills a character outright. Ouch. <em>The Safety Ring makes you immune to this status.</em></p><p><strong>Doom</strong>: This status effect places a counter above a character’s head. When it reaches 0, that character will die. Sucks to be them!</p><p><strong>Dread</strong>: This status effect makes it impossible to use Brave or Default. How dreadful. <em>You can cure it with Esuna/Esunaga.</em></p><p><strong>Love</strong>: This status effect causes a character to fall in love with another ally. Because of this, they will receive all of the same damage and status effects of the ally they’re in love with, as well as copy the ally’s moves. </p><p><strong>Paralysis</strong>: This status effect causes a character to be unable to use any actions for a few turns. <em>The Earthing Rod makes you immune to this status. You can cure it with Esuna/Esunaga.</em></p><p><strong>Poison</strong>: This status effect causes a character to take damage on each turn. Come on, you knew this one already. <em>The Star Pendant makes you immune to this status. You can cure it with Esuna/Esunaga and Poisona. </em></p><p><strong>Silence</strong>: This status effect makes it so that a character is unable to use magic. <em>The White Cape makes you immune to this status. You can cure it with Esuna/Esunaga.</em></p><p><strong>Sleep</strong>: This status effect puts a character to sleep, rendering them incapable of using any actions for a few turns. How cozy! <em>Clothespin makes you immune to this status. You can cure it with Esuna/Esunaga.</em></p><p><strong>Status Down</strong>: This status effect reduces one of your character’s stats temporarily. <em>You can recover from this with Despell.</em></p><p><strong>Stop</strong>: This status effect renders a character unable to move, opening them up to attacks. <em>Despell will knock this out.</em></p><hr><h2 id="h362"><a id="2"></a>How long does it take for status effects to go away?</h2><p>Good news: Some of these status effects have a chance to go away on their own on the next turn. The chance of these debuffs vanishing increases, though not at the same rate for each status. Here are the following chances of recovering from certain statuses on your own (by “turn”, we mean <em>your character’s </em>turn, not just any turn:</p><p><strong>Charm</strong>: Charm follows the same pattern as Confuse for auto-recovery. </p><p><strong>Confuse</strong>: You have a 20-percent chance to recover from Confuse on your next turn. This increases by 10-percent for the next two turns, followed by a 60-percent chance. After six turns, Confuse will go away on its own. </p><p><strong>Dread: </strong>Starts at a 25-percent chance on the next turn, followed by a 25-percent chance of an automatic recovery with each passing turn.</p><p><strong>Paralysis: </strong>20-percent chance for recovery, followed by a 5-percent increase on the following turn and a 25-percent chance for each subsequent turn thereafter. </p><p><strong>Sleep:</strong> 25-percent chance for recovery on next turn. Adds an additional 25 percent chance with each proceeding turn. </p><p><strong>Stop:</strong> Starting with a 20-percent chance of recovery, the next turn sees your recovery chance increase by five-percent, then a 25-percent increase with each passing turn of yours.</p><hr><p>Now that you know what status effects to expect in <em>Bravely Default: Flying Fairy HD</em>, you’ll be far more prepared for battle. The game is available now exclusively on Nintendo Switch 2, so go save the world!  </p></div></div><br/><br/>https://kotaku.com/bravely-default-flying-fairy-hd-status-paralysis-sleep-1851785720]]></content:encoded>
