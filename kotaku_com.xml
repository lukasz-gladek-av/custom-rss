              <p>Video game piracy, the common and controversial practice of copying and sharing games without paying for them, has its advocates. One of them was Anadius, a popular fixture in the <i>Sims</i> community for his “<i>Sim 4</i> Updater” tool which allowed users to pirate the game’s many expansions. I say “was,” because the fellow has gone dark, and in his wake, all that’s left is disappointment and disagreement over the state of the work he’s left behind.</p> <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">All done! Have fun playing the game! 🙂</p> <p>— anadius (@anadius) <a href="https://twitter.com/anadius/status/1991539527018557494?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 20, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <p>“I decided to step down,” <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/PiratedGames/comments/1p28a9o/comment/npveo2e/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button">Anadius said</a> before pulling a Bilbo Baggins (<a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/the-sims/the-sims-4-legend-behind-piracy-tool-rendering-nearly-usd1-500-of-dlc-totally-free-quits-town-and-takes-his-loot-with-em-players-pay-tribute-as-copycats-immediately-try-to-charge-for-alternatives/">h/t <i>GamesRadar</i></a>). “Don’t pester my close friends, till the end I acted like an asshole I am and haven’t told them the reason why either.” His departure has sent shockwaves through the r/PiratedGames community and those who relied on his tools to play <i>The Sims 4</i>. But he didn’t take all of his toys with him; he left behind the source code for his work, enabling others to pick up the pieces and continue to sail the seven seas. Someone has already stepped in to do just that. Problem is, she’s locked these pirate tools up behind a paywall via Patreon.</p>

 <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">Simmerella has shared the news on Patreon (free) that they'll be working on a *NEW* updater, and have been given all requireed files to make that happen.</p> <p>See their announcement below:<a href="https://t.co/Zks92KogfZ">https://t.co/Zks92KogfZ</a></p> <p>— GewoonIraj (@xLOLxLOLxIRAJx) <a href="https://twitter.com/xLOLxLOLxIRAJx/status/1991842574290583784?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 21, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <p>Popular <i>Sims 4</i> modder Simmerella took over Anadius’ work. But while some pirate communities are okay with paying a certain amount of money for access to troves of pirated material, this segment of the <i>Sims </i>community isn’t too thrilled, especially considering the fact that <a href="https://x.com/impekko/status/1991922291018698781?s=20">Anadius didn’t charge for his work</a>.</p> <p>There’s another potential wrinkle in all of this: the fact that Simmerella is using a popular funding platform to more or less sell piracy services. As <i>Sims</i> creator <a href="https://x.com/SimMattically/status/1991888537718018510?s=20">SimMattically put it</a> in an X thread documenting the community reaction to the news, “you have to put your legal name and pay taxes on your Patreon earnings lmfao bless [Simmerella] and good luck.”</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/samsung-is-going-nuts-990-pro-2tb-ssd-going-for-pennies-when-you-buy-on-amazon-2000646246</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/samsung-is-going-nuts-990-pro-2tb-ssd-going-for-pennies-when-you-buy-on-amazon.1361218/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>The Samsung 990 Pro 2TB is the <strong>best-seller among internal SSDs on Amazon this Black Friday</strong>, and that makes total sense given what you’re getting. Storage speed is the single greatest determinant of whether your computer feels snappy or sluggish, as fast SSDs eliminate boot delays, application loading, and file transfer bottlenecks. This drive delivers flagship performance at pricing that makes it the best value proposition in the SSD market right now. Amazon <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4513/">has it down to $169 for Black Friday, down from $229</a>, which marks a record low that places professional-grade storage well within reach of anyone building or upgrading a PC.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4513/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>7,450 MB/s Read Speed Eliminates Storage Bottlenecks</h2>
<p>The s<strong>equential read speed of 7,450 MB/s</strong> represents the ceiling of what PCIe Gen 4 technology can do. You boot Windows in under 10 seconds, fire up applications in an instant, and transfer large files between drives in a matter of seconds-not minutes. In-game loading, when the game is loaded on this drive, is faster than on SATA SSDs or hard drives, with some titles eliminating loading screens altogether through DirectStorage support. It makes a big difference in day-to-day use, where everything from opening folders to extracting compressed files happens faster than you expect.</p>
<p><strong>Sequential write speeds reach 6,900 MB/s</strong> to handle large file creation and modification with ease. For video editors working with 4K or 8K footage, timeline scrubbing remains smooth, while render times significantly decrease. Content creators exporting large projects onto this drive find transfers complete in a fraction of the time that SATA drives normally would take.</p>



<p>The 2TB capacity allows for installing your OS, applications, and a substantial game library without relying on secondary storage. Modern games take up 50-150GB each, and with this capacity, you can store 15-40 titles depending on how large the files are. You keep the most played games installed and ready, instead of always having to reinstall and uninstall based on which one you want to play.</p>
<p>To achieve these speeds, the PCIe Gen 4 interface uses four lanes of bandwidth on compatible motherboards. The M.2 2280 form factor fits into the standard slots on modern motherboards without the need for adapters or special mounting hardware. This drive will work in older systems that have PCIe Gen 3 slots but will run at reduced speeds limited by that interface. Most motherboards from the past five years support PCIe Gen 4, making this drive compatible with the majority of current builds.</p>



<p>The <strong>thermal solution involves a heat spreader</strong> that radiates the heat during continuous operation. High-speed SSDs generate thermal energy during continuous intensive read and write operations, and proper cooling keeps performance within limits. The included spreader does its work quite effectively in most scenarios, but it’s even better with systems that have dedicated M.2 heatsinks or motherboard cooling solutions. The drive implements thermal throttling, which drops the speeds temporarily when temperatures exceed safe limits, ensuring hardware protection while continuing operation.</p>
<p>Drive management tools such as performance optimization, firmware updates, and health monitoring are available through<em> Samsung Magician</em> software. You manage remaining drive life, securely erase data, and optimize settings for different workloads. The software normally runs in the background, usually alerting you to firmware updates or potential issues before they can become a problem.</p>
<p>At $169, you get Samsung’s flagship SSD with PCIe Gen 4 speeds for 26% off, dropping pro performance down to the mid-range drive price class.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/oneplus-13-reaches-record-low-amazon-turns-it-into-serious-iphone-17-rival-this-black-friday-2000646239</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/oneplus-13-reaches-record-low-amazon-turns-it-into-serious-iphone-17-rival-this-black-friday.1361179/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Flagship iPhones and Samsung Galaxy phones rule the premium space, but OnePlus challenges both with specs that match, if not outpace, most of their offerings at significantly lower costs. OnePlus 13 has a real shot at going head-to-head with the iPhone 17 and Galaxy S25 and offers flagship performance without that flagship price tag.</p>
<p>Amazon <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5808/">dropped the 256GB model to $699 for Black Friday, down from its usual $899</a>, which is <strong>an all-time low</strong> that makes this Samsung and Apple rival affordable.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5808/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Industry-Leading Performance</h2>
<p>The <strong>Snapdragon 8 Elite is Qualcomm’s high-end chipset, fabricated on a 3nm node</strong>. It strikes an excellent balance between high performance and energy efficiency. It handles demanding tasks from 4K video editing to high-end gaming without any thermal throttling or slowdown. Benchmarks peg it above Apple’s A18 Pro in multi-core operations and somewhere around Apple in single-core tasks. In reality, apps open instantly, multitasking remains fluid even with several dozen apps open, and games run smoothly at the highest settings available with stable frame rates.</p>
<p>The 12GB RAM makes sure everything runs smoothly from casual use to pro workflows. You can switch between apps without reloading them, keep extensive browser sessions running, and open demanding apps together with no performance degradation. This amount of RAM is more than what the majority of its competitors offer in this price bracket, not to mention that Samsung demands a much higher price for the same amount of RAM in its S25 series.</p>



<p>The <strong>80W SUPERVOOC fast charging</strong> fills the battery from empty to full in about 30 minutes, eliminating the anxiety of low battery during busy days. You plug in during a quick break and gain hours of usage. This is much faster than the iPhone 17’s 27W and Galaxy S25’s 45W, giving the OnePlus a substantial practical advantage. The 50W AIRVOOC wireless charging brings fast charging convenience without cables, matching what flagship phones typically offer through wired connections.</p>
<p>The <strong>Hasselblad camera partnership works with color science and image processing</strong> to ensure pictures appear natural instead of oversaturated social media-ready. The primary sensor takes vivid photos in bright daylight or challenging low-light situations. The camera system features ultrawide and telephoto lenses that maintain consistent quality across focal lengths. Hasselblad’s involvement shows in the nuanced color reproduction and dynamic range that gives photos a more refined look compared to typical Android processing.</p>



<p>The<strong> 6.82-inch AMOLED display features a refresh rate of 120Hz</strong> which smooths out scrolling and makes touches super responsive. The screen brightness goes as high as 4500 nits under very particular conditions, well enough that it’s readable in direct sunlight when other phones would wash out. It supports HDR10+ for better contrast while watching compatible video content.</p>
<p><strong>OxygenOS offers a clean Android experience (our favorite)</strong> with some very useful customizations that don’t bloat the interface. It also comes with three years of major Android updates and four years of security patches, keeping your phone current and secure. Additional features include game mode, parallel apps that allow running multiple accounts, and expansive gesture controls to enhance daily usability.</p>
<p><strong>Battery life reaches a full day of heavy use</strong> with screen-on time exceeding 7 hours for most users. With the combination of efficient processor and large battery capacity, you are not hunting for chargers in the middle of the day. The phone handles heavy tasks such as navigation, video streaming, and gaming without frequent power management.</p>
<p>You get here flagship spec with Snapdragon 8 Elite and 80W charging at $699 which is $200 less than Samsung’s equivalent S25 and $300+ below the iPhone 17. Leading performance meets extremely fast charging and Hasselblad camera processing for true value that makes the traditional flagship pricing from Apple and Samsung increasingly hard to justify.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/ubisoft-ai-fps-temmates-genai-nfts-gameplay-snowdrop-reveal-2000646251</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/ubisoft-shows-off-new-ai-powered-fps-and-hopes-you%E2%80%99ve-forgotten-about-its-failed-nfts.1361176/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Despite the fact that many gamers seem to dislike or even outright hate AI-generated content in games, Ubisoft is pushing forward with it and now playtesting a shooter experiment built around AI-powered NPCs that can react to voice commands in real-time. Will it help the publisher regain some stability as it continues to struggle? I’m not sure. <a href="https://kotaku.com/we-live-in-hell-and-this-ubisoft-nft-that-requires-you-1848202326">All I can think about is the last time Ubisoft jumped on a tech fad with NFTs</a>.</p> <p><a href="https://news.ubisoft.com/en-us/article/3mWlITIuWuu0MoVuR6o8ps/ubisoft-reveals-teammates-an-ai-experiment-to-change-the-game">On November 21,</a> after <a href="https://kotaku.com/assassins-creed-black-flag-remake-ubisoft-sold-ai-2000646161">a delayed earnings call</a>, Ubisoft revealed <em>Teammates</em>, which the company refers to as its “first playable generative AI research project.” Built in the Snowdrop Engine, the same tech that powers games like <em>The Division 2</em> and<em> Star Wars Outlaws</em>, <em>Teammates</em> is a first-person shooter that includes an AI assistant named Jaspar and two AI-powered squadmates called Pablo and Sofia. Players can command these two to help them solve puzzles or engage in combat using “natural” voice commands.&nbsp; Meanwhile, Jaspar can help track missions, offer advice, and provide guidance when needed.</p>

 <p><em>Teammates</em> is built by the same team behind <a href="https://news.ubisoft.com/en-us/article/5qXdxhshJBXoanFZApdG3L/how-ubisofts-new-generative-ai-prototype-changes-the-narrative-for-npcs">Ubisoft’s Neo NPCs</a>, which the company showed off in 2024 at GDC. The main goal of those AI-powered NPCs was to provide characters who can “dynamically” react to players in real-time, but within guidelines established by Ubisoft designers. The company said that it had guardrails in place to help stop the AI companions from hallucinating, being overly toxic, or going completely off script. But even Ubisoft admitted <a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/ubisoft-s-first-playable-generative-ai-experience-is-an-r-d-experiment-called-teammates-">in an interview with <em>Game Developer</em></a> that <em>Teammates</em> and its tech were still rough around the edges.</p>

 <p>In interviews about <em>Teammates</em>, Ubisoft tries to make the case that this tech won’t remove the human element from video game development. I find that hard to believe, considering that over the last two years or so, the studio has <a href="https://www.blog.udonis.co/mobile-marketing/mobile-games/ubisoft-layoffs">laid off over 600 employees</a> as it cuts costs and struggles to ship games people get excited about. I’m not sure NPCs that sort of listen to you when you tell them to do something is going to turn things around for Ubisoft, but it could potentially let them gut even more of the company while pivoting to AI moonshots at a time when the company’s future has never been more uncertain.</p>

 <p>“Games of tomorrow will listen, understand, and react to players far more than today, and our research gives a glimpse of what adaptive, generative play could add on top of proven game systems,”<a href="https://variety.com/2025/digital/news/ubisoft-generative-ai-game-teammates-neo-npc-developers-1236588038/"> Ubisoft director of GenAI gameplay Xavier Manzanares told <em>Variety</em>.</a> “It’s the first time we’ve shared an experiment this early with players, but our goal is to pave the way with a strong technology layer so our creators can start imagining the value it could bring to their project and players.”</p> <p>And who even knows if Ubisoft will still be developing AI-powered content and tools in a few years? Remember, it wasn’t that long ago that Ubisoft was all in on NFTs and the metaverse. Sure, <a href="https://kotaku.com/ubisoft-captain-laserhawk-the-game-nft-crypto-1851726108">Ubisoft technically hasn’t</a> completely <a href="https://x.com/EdenOnline_exe/status/1989025366669701411">given up on either</a>. But it’s pretty clear now that the company is moving on to AI as the next big thing that it hopes can convince investors that it is on the cutting edge of the future and deserving of more money, please.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><span>Oscar Isaac, star of Guillermo del Toro’s </span><i><span>Frankenstein </span></i><span>film, signs a lot of autographs. Prior to his role as the titular doctor in del Toro’s take on the Gothic horror classic, he was Poe Dameron in </span><i><span>Star Wars</span></i><span>, Duke Leto Atreides in </span><i><span>Dune</span></i><span>, and one of the alternate Spider-Men in</span><i><span> Across the Spider-Verse</span></i><span>. This man has been made into a Funko Pop several times over, and he clearly feels some type of way about them.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>He can probably spot an autograph reseller a mile away, too. That may be what happened when someone approached him outside of the Egyptian Theater in Los Angeles yesterday and asked him to sign some </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/funko-pop-starnger-things-bitty-bankrupt-2000642395"><span>Funko Pops</span></a><span>, to which Isaac replied, “Nah, man, I’m not doing those Funkos.” </span></p>

 <p><span>The POV recording, from the perspective of the Funko Pop wielder, showed the stranger holding out a </span><i><span>Spider-Man 2099</span></i><span> Funko Pop after Isaac signs a </span><i><span>Frankenstein </span></i><span>poster from the back of a truck, then stepping away, slightly dejected after the denial.</span></p>

 <div><blockquote cite="https://www.tiktok.com/@eladiioenrrique/video/7574866863277100319" data-video-id="7574866863277100319" data-embed-from="oembed"> <section> <a target="_blank" title="@eladiioenrrique" href="https://www.tiktok.com/@eladiioenrrique?refer=embed">@eladiioenrrique</a>  <p>11/16/2025 – On Sunday, I got a last minute tip that Oscar Isaac was going to be at the Egyptian Theatre, (I know I told you this through DM but thank you again!), (you know who you are lol), so I tried to get him to sign my Spider-Man 2099 Funko Pops along with a Moon Knight Funko and a Spider-Man 2099 mini poster for my sister, of course in the video you only see the pops, but unfortunately Oscar stopped for the kid Grapher to sign Frankenstein items but he didn’t want to sign Marvel items. It was great to see him in person and honestly I don’t blame him at all, it was a long shot especially after hearing that he isn’t on good terms with Disney after that whole Kimmel incident but I was hoping he would sign the merch at least because imo he is still the most badass Miguel O’Hara and Moon Knight out there, he makes both characters, I’m sorry lol. I’m definitely going to get backlash for that lol. But anyways, thought I would share my interaction with him, and if Oscar sees this somehow, Oscar I understand and hopefully one day I can still get your autograph on the Spider-Man 2099 as well as my sister’s mini poster&nbsp;! Oh and if Disney sees this, please fix things with Oscar, we need him back in marvel, there is no Moon Knight or Spider-Man 2099 without him. <a title="spiderman2099" target="_blank" href="https://www.tiktok.com/tag/spiderman2099?refer=embed">#spiderman2099</a>  <a title="oscarisaac" target="_blank" href="https://www.tiktok.com/tag/oscarisaac?refer=embed">#OscarIsaac</a>  <a title="fyp" target="_blank" href="https://www.tiktok.com/tag/fyp?refer=embed">#fyp</a>  <a title="disney" target="_blank" href="https://www.tiktok.com/tag/disney?refer=embed">#Disney</a>  <a title="frankenstein" target="_blank" href="https://www.tiktok.com/tag/frankenstein?refer=embed">#Frankenstein</a> </p> <p> <a target="_blank" title="♬ original sound - eladiioenrrique" href="https://www.tiktok.com/music/original-sound-7574866731131292447?refer=embed">♬ original sound – eladiioenrrique</a> </p></section> </blockquote></div>   <p><span>The Funko Pop collector, known as </span><a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@eladiioenrrique?lang=en"><span>EladiioEnrrique on TikTok</span></a><span>, alleged in the caption of his video that Isaac “didn’t want to sign Marvel items.”&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><span>“It was a long shot, especially after hearing that he isn’t on good terms with Disney after that whole Kimmel incident,” he wrote, referring to Isaac’s recent </span><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XciB_FC2fzs"><i><span>GQ</span></i><span> interview</span></a><span> in which he said he’d consider reprising his role as Poe in </span><i><span>Star Wars</span></i><span> only “if they can kinda figure out [how], you know, not [to] succumb to fascism.” He was referring to ABC and Disney’s brief suspension of their late-night show host back in September after Jimmy Kimmel joked about the Trump administration’s reaction to the assassination of Charlie Kirk.</span></p>

 <p><span>It’s not clear if Isaac was refusing to sign Marvel merch specifically or if he was just refusing to sign Funko Pops in general, as they’re incredibly popular on the autograph reseller market. There are nearly 100,000 results for “signed Funko Pop” on eBay, with many of them going for a few hundred dollars. It’s now not uncommon for people like the owner of the aforementioned TikTok channel to follow celebrities around with several pieces of their respective merch in hand and ask for autographs, only to later try to flip them online for thousands of dollars.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><span>A </span><a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@eladiioenrrique/video/7570077334158511390?lang=en"><span>different video from EladiioEnrrique’s account</span></a><span> shows a horde of people waiting for pop star Miley Cyrus to sign autographs. One person has all of her vinyls taped together in a vertical stack, while another has several items hung from a hangar, all to make a mass-signing as quick and painless as possible.</span></p>

 <p><span>Most of EladiioEnrrique’s channel is just first-person POV videos of him getting celebrities to sign records, CDs, and, of course, Funko Pops. His latest video says that he got a “last-minute tip” that Isaac would be at the Egyptian Theater before rushing over to get the signatures.

              <p>For years, Sonos made its name with WiFi streaming alone, avoiding Bluetooth at all costs to keep audio quality high. It finally relented with portable speakers, realizing convenience does matter for some use cases without invalidating the core WiFi basis of what makes Sonos so great. The <strong>Era 100</strong> competes directly with Bose and Sony’s premium offerings while it currently sells for mid-range pricing that makes no sense given its capabilities. Amazon <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5807/">dropped this to $169 for Black Friday, down from $199, which is a record low</a> that puts exceptional audio within reach of anyone looking for Bluetooth speakers.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5807/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>47% Faster Processor Powers Dual-Tweeter Architecture</h2>
<p>The next-generation processor handles more complex audio processing in real time and enables features that previous Sonos speakers couldn’t support. Dual tweeters create genuine stereo separation from a single speaker, placing instruments and vocals in distinct left and right positions. This architecture produces a soundstage that fills rooms rather than feeling like sound emanates from a single point. The <strong>25% larger midwoofer extends bass response deeper than the previous generation</strong>, and gives kick drums and bass lines actual impact without needing a separate subwoofer for most music.</p>
<p>This compact design fits easily on bookshelves, kitchen counters, desks and nightstands. You place the speaker wherever you really spend time, rather than arranging furniture around audio equipment. <strong>The size makes it truly portable inside your home</strong>&nbsp;and moves from room to room as the day progresses with you. It weighs enough to feel substantial yet remains light enough to carry easily in one hand.</p>



<p>Wi-Fi streaming provides lossless audio quality from the likes of Spotify, Apple Music, Tidal, and Amazon Music. The connection also remains stable throughout a home without the dropouts that plague Bluetooth in larger spaces. You control playback through the Sonos app which aggregates all of your streaming services into one interface. AirPlay 2 support adds another streaming option for Apple users who want to send audio directly from their devices.</p>
<p><strong>Bluetooth connectivity handles quick pairing with phones</strong>, tablets, and laptops when you want simple wireless playback. You press a button on the back of the speaker, and instantly, your device finds it. This mode is great for playing podcasts, audiobooks, or music from apps that aren’t integrated into the Sonos ecosystem. The implementation of Bluetooth maintains decent quality, though Wi-Fi streaming sounds noticeably better when that option is available.</p>
<p>The Line-In Adapter includes <strong>a 3.5mm auxiliary input to connect turntables</strong>, CD players, or other analog sources. This adapter is available separately but turns the Era 100 into a powered speaker for vinyl setups or legacy audio equipment. It combines digital streaming with analog input flexibility that pure Bluetooth speakers simply can’t compete with.</p>



<p>Trueplay tuning uses your iPhone’s microphone to <strong>analyze room acoustics and then automatically adjust the speaker’s EQ</strong>. You wave your phone around the listening area for about a minute, and it makes a custom sound profile optimized for your particular space. This calibration compensates for room characteristics, such as hard surfaces that create reflections or soft furnishings that absorb sound. The difference between tuned and untuned sound is immediately noticeable, with vocals becoming clearer and bass tightening up.</p>
<p><strong>Alexa integration enables voice control</strong> for music playback, smart home commands, and general queries. The built-in microphones pick up voice commands clearly even when music plays at moderate volumes. You can add the Era 100 to multi-room setups with other Sonos speakers, creating a whole-home audio system that plays synchronized music everywhere or different content in each room. This ecosystem approach means starting with one speaker and expanding over time as budget allows.</p>
<p>For $169, you’re getting Sonos premium audio engineering, with both WiFi and Bluetooth for less than mid-range speakers elsewhere that can’t compete on sound quality. Similarly priced Bose and Sony speakers rely exclusively on Bluetooth and don’t have the multi-room capabilities that make Sonos special.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>There’s no shortage of laptops in the market, but not every powerful laptop is a gaming laptop. Standard laptops (made for everyday work and casual use) prioritize features like battery life, decent display, and lower costs. Gaming machines, on the other hand, pack high-performance components that can let you game and work on creative projects without slowing down. These options typically have stronger dedicated GPUs and CPUs, faster RAMs, and a bigger storage capacity, but as you’d expect, they can cost a pretty penny.</p>
<p>Most solid options out there with all this and more sit well over $1,500, but that changes today. Amazon has kick-started its Black Friday and Cyber Monday celebrations already with some impressive early deals across a range of categories.<a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5798/"> As part of that, the retailer has also dropped the price of the 16-inch ASUS TUF gaming laptop by 32%.</a> On a regular day, it would run you around $1,100, but you can snap it up for just $750 today. Honestly, that’s what most entry-level machines cost nowadays, which makes this offer no less than a steal. Of course, the stock is selling out fast, so there’s not much time left to save. If you have been wanting to upgrade your gaming experience for less, today is the day to make the move. In fact, this laptop can also be a great Christmas gift for a player in your life!</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5798/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Powerful GPU, Immersive Visuals</h2>
<p>There’s nothing too crazy going on with the design. The laptop looks and feels sturdy, plus comes with a subtle embossed TUF logo on its cover. The brand has thoroughly tested it to meet Military Grade testing standards, so you can expect it to handle everyday wear and tear well. Harsh conditions such as extreme temperatures, high humidity, and dirt won’t affect its performance one bit. But despite the sturdy, don’t-mess-with-me build, it’s lightweight enough to carry around easily. Take it to your office, nearby cafe, and even on some adventures without a worry.</p>
<p>Open it up and you’re greeted with a 16-inch Full HD display, which pushes immersive, detailed visuals. The 90% screen-to-body ratio gives you plenty of space to work and play. Color accuracy is excellent in all lighting conditions, making the content appear lifelike. The display also supports a 144Hz refresh rate to keep everything running smoothly, while the Adaptive-Sync technology actively reduces lag and minimizes stuttering for ultra-smooth gameplay.</p>



<p>Power is handled by an Intel Core i5 210H processor that’s paired with the underrated NVIDIA GeForce RTX 4050. The GPU offers a significant performance boost over its predecessor and is a great entry-level option for those on a budget. Then there’s a modest 16GB RAM for increased efficiency. It’s not massive, but does a good job of handling everyday multitasking and most modern titles without throwing a fit. You will also be able to store all your favorite games and creative programs without feeling limited, thanks to the massive 512GB PCIe Gen4 SSD. And since SSDs offer much faster system boot and load times, you won’t have to wait long to get on with your day.</p>
<p>Best of all, despite powerful performance, the laptop does not overheat. ASUS has packed it with Arc Flow Fans, 4 exhaust vents, 5 dedicated heat pipes, and an anti-dust filter; all of which come together to keep things cool and quiet in the background as you teach some bad guys a lesson. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5798/">There’s a lot more to like about this laptop, especially now that it’s going for just $750. The discount won’t be around forever, so it’s best to get your orders in fast.</a></p>
