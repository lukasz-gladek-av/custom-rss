              <p>Earlier this week, someone leaked what they claim to be new <em>Fallout</em>-themed merchandise that will reportedly soon be available on Target shelves around the United States. But fans think that at least one piece of leaked merch is using AI-generated imagery, aka slop.</p> <p>On September 2, a user on the <em>Fallout</em> subreddit posted a short video of them seemingly pulling out pieces of not-yet-announced <em>Fallout</em>-themed merchandise in a warehouse-like setting. The user claimed that the <em>Fallout</em> goodies would be sold at Target starting in November or December. <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Fallout/comments/1n6x4fy/the_new_items_at_target/?utm_source=embedv2&amp;utm_medium=post_embed&amp;utm_content=post_body&amp;embed_host_url=https://kotaku.com/wp/wp-admin/post.php">The original video has since been deleted</a>, possibly because the original poster was nervous about getting in trouble with Target. But <em>Kotaku</em> viewed the video before it was deleted, and the merch seemed real. And one item, <em>Fallout</em>-themed hot sauce, appears to be shipping to stores in a box that has AI-generated imagery on the back.</p> <p><a href="https://www.pcgamesn.com/fallout/generative-ai-merch">As spotted by <em>PCGamesn</em>,</a> users in the comments below the leaked Target video began focusing on peculiarities in the hot sauce artwork. In the image, a couple is seen sitting at a table eating a Deathclaw’s hand. But the man can be seen using his knife and fork to cut up a napkin. The fork looks oddly shaped, too. Others pointed out that the Deathclaw hand seems to be floating oddly above the plate. The man’s right hand also seems off. All of this would lead one to believe this new <em>Fallout</em> merch is using AI-generated artwork.</p>

   <p><em>Kotaku</em> contacted Bethesda about the leaked art, but didn’t receive a response before publication. It should be noted that Bethesda likely contracted this artwork out via another company and didn’t create the image.</p> <p>The use of <a href="https://kotaku.com/hearthstone-diablo-ai-art-blizzard-microsoft-1851787162">AI-generated slop</a> has become <a href="https://kotaku.com/xbox-microsoft-xbox-ai-generated-1851128191">more and more prevalent in marketing and advertising</a> over the last two years as companies desperate to make the line go up cut corners to prove to investors they aren’t being left behind as AI-powered tech continues to grow. <a href="https://kotaku.com/fallout-tv-amazon-ai-art-bethesda-strike-release-date-1850772308">In fact, this isn’t even the first time an official <em>Fallout</em>-related artwork</a> has been scrutinized by fans for some strange, AI-like oddities. Will a man using a terrible fork to cut up a napkin stop collectors and fans from buying this piece of <em>Fallout</em> merch? Probably not, which is what companies are counting on.</p>

              <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/007-first-light-reveals-new-james-bond-face-ps5-trailer-1851783647"><em>007: First Light,</em></a> the next game from the development studio behind <em>Hitman</em>, is launching on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, Switch 2, and PC in March 2026, as revealed during Sony’s latest State of Play.</p> <p>On September 3, <a href="https://kotaku.com/james-bond-state-play-wolverine-god-war-sony-showcase-2000622073">as previously announced</a>, Sony and IO Interactive showed off over 30 minutes of <em>007: First Light</em>, giving us our first real look at gameplay following some <a href="https://kotaku.com/007-first-light-reveals-new-james-bond-face-ps5-trailer-1851783647">teasers and trailers.</a> And at the end of the showcase—which featured Bond sneaking around, killing people, driving various vehicles, and causing mayhem—IOI revealed that <em>First Light</em> is launching on March 27, 2026 on all platforms.</p> <p>Here’s a new gameplay trailer of Bond in action:</p>  <p>Of course, because in the year 2025, <a href="https://kotaku.com/paid-early-access-pre-order-madden-star-wars-outlaws-1851596675">all games must have expensive pre-order versions and early access bonuses</a>, if you pre-order any version of the game digitally, you get to play 24 hours “early.” <a href="https://ioi.dk/007firstlightgame">What is more shocking is the $300 special collector’s edition</a> of <em>007: First Light.</em> This pricey package includes a physical copy of the game, some digital goodies, and a replica Golden Gun, as well as gold bullets and a stand to display them with. Seems a bit odd to include such a classic Bond prop in a game that, seemingly, has nothing to do with that era of the franchise, but hey, what do I know?</p>   <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/the-makers-of-hitman-are-working-on-a-new-james-bond-ga-1845713628">First announced back in 2020</a>,<em> 007: First Ligh</em>t is the long-awaited next game from IO Interactive, and it tells the tale of a younger James Bond as he completes some of his first missions. It’s been a long five-year wait for fans of <em>Hitman</em> who are hoping that <em>First Light</em> will play a lot like Agent 47’s franchise. In today’s State of Play reveal, it did indeed seem like this is very much a <em>Hitman</em>-style game, with multiple options for infiltrating areas and a big focus on stealth and problem-solving. However, the gameplay in the presentation also had moments that were marred by some nasty performance dips and a lot of motion blur. Hopefully, <em>007: First Light</em> looks better and runs well when it arrives on Switch 2, PS5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC on March 27, 2026.</p>
