              <p>Want a powerhouse laptop without having to take out a second mortgage? Most of us just can’t justify spending $4,000 on a computer, no matter how impressive the specs might be. A premium price like that puts premium computing firmly out of reach for the average professional or student. But right now, Dell has slashed the price on <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5373/">their Inspiron 16 laptop (Ryzen 7 8-core 8840U, 32GB DDR5 RAM, 1TB SSD) from $3,999 to just… $989</a>.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5373/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<p>This Dell laptop <strong>features an eight-core AMD Ryzen 7 8840U processor</strong> that will make video editing and complex spreadsheets fly, not to mention everything in between. Its architecture also supports AI-enhanced tasks which means that it’s ready for the next generation of productivity applications that are becoming the norm in professional environments. <strong>Surround that chip with 32GB of DDR5 RAM</strong>, and you get a system comfortable juggling dozens of browser tabs and background apps all at the same time.</p>



<h2>Perfect for Long Sessions</h2>
<p>The <strong>16-inch FHD+ display stretches to 1920×1200 resolution</strong> and gives you extra vertical space compared to the standard Full HD screens. That additional screen real estate makes a noticeable difference when you’re working with documents, coding, or comparing data side by side. Dell has fitted this screen with an anti-glare coating and its ComfortView technology, filtering out harmful blue light without distorting colors.</p>
<p>The backlit keyboard will let you comfortably work in a variety of places-from the coffee shop down the block to late-night home office sessions. Dell has fitted the keys with decent travel and spacing, such that typing feels natural, not cramped. The <strong>AI Copilot key offers one-touch access to Microsoft’s AI assistant</strong> for streamlined tasks like drafting emails, summarizing documents or generating content suggestions.</p>



<p>What’s more, the fingerprint reader saves you from typing passwords throughout your day and offers more secure authentication than the old login methods. The privacy camera cover gives you physical control over your webcam to put worries about unauthorized access or accidentally showing up on video calls to rest. These are not fancy features, but they safeguard your data and privacy in very practical ways.</p>
<p>The 54Whr battery keeps this laptop <strong>running through a full workday of typical use</strong>. From virtual meetings and working on documents to web browsing and content streaming, there isn’t much you can’t do on the move without having to constantly hunt for outlets. And when you do, the system allows for fast charging in order to get you back up and running quickly.</p>
<p>For $989, this configuration becomes a very compelling value for anyone who needs reliable computing power for business. Spending $3,999 initially put this kind of performance out of the reach of most buyers, and this clearance sale changes the equation entirely.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/here%E2%80%99s-how-you-make-coping-kingdom-hearts-fans-lose-their-shit.1345813/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><span>It’s tough being a </span><i><span>Kingdom Hearts </span></i><span>fan when Square Enix drops an announcement trailer for </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/kingdom-hearts-iv-4-square-enix-disney-announced-reveal-1848774720"><i><span>Kingdom Hearts IV</span></i></a><i><span>,</span></i><span> then mostly disappears for three years. These days, those waiting to hear more about Goofy and company’s next foray into the Disney/</span><i><span>Final Fantasy </span></i><span>crossover universe will lap up even the smallest of crumbs in hopes that it means a full-course meal could be waiting for them at the end of development. This week’s crumb is an Instagram story from Haley Joel Osment, the voice behind </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/kingdom-hearts-best-games-ranked-2-3-birth-by-sleep-1851494518"><i><span>Kingdom Hearts</span></i><span>’</span></a><span> key-wielding hero Sora, that implies he’s recording…something!</span></p> <p><span>On November 5, Osment posted a photo to his Instagram story of a big red sign that says “RECORDING” with the caption “Back to work” in what looks like a recording studio. Now, this could be for anything. Osment has done plenty of voice work over his decades-long acting career, and it’s not limited to playing Sora in the </span><i><span>Kingdom Hearts </span></i><span>series, which he’s done since the series’ debut in the PS2 era. Take a cursory look at his acting credits, and you’ll see he’s done a lot of voiceovers for tons of animated Marvel, DC, and </span><i><span>Star Wars </span></i><span>projects over the past few years. So it’s entirely possible he’s just doing another routine gig.</span></p>

 <p><span>But we also don’t know that this </span><i><span>isn’t</span></i><span> him gearing up for another monologue about how Sora’s friends are his power, right? </span><i><span>Kingdom Hearts IV </span></i><span>is </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/kingdom-hearts-4-screenshots-mickey-sora-release-date-1851780809"><span>still in an uncertain point of development</span></a><span>, but if Square Enix is considering a re-reveal of sorts, it’s entirely possible Osment is doing a session or two for a trailer. But let’s not jump to conclusions. Nobody would ever get themselves in a tizzy over a simple, nondescript Instagram story, right?&nbsp;</span></p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/call-of-duty-passed-on-spielberg-and-now-he%E2%80%99s-making-gremlins-3.1345810/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>35 years later, Warner Bros has finally announced it’s making a <em>Gremlins 3</em>. The new sequel will be executive-produced by Steven Spielberg, <a href="https://kotaku.com/spielberg-call-duty-movie-activision-medal-honor-2000623436">who reportedly was denied a chance to make a <em>Call of Duty</em> movie</a>, so why not help produce a new <a href="https://kotaku.com/games/gremlins-2-the-new-batch-1"><em>Gremlins</em></a> movie instead?</p> <p>On November 6, Warner Bros. Discovery chief David “I’m Bad At My Job” Zaslav <a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/movies/movie-news/warners-gremlins-3-steven-spielberg-chris-columbus-1236419932/">announced during the company’s third-quarter earnings call</a> that a third <em>Gremlins</em> movie had recently been greenlit and had some big names attached. As mentioned, Spielberg is returning to the franchise to once again be an executive producer and will be producing the sequel through his company, Amblin Entertainment. Meanwhile, the writer behind the OG 1984 <em>Gremlins</em> movie, Chris Columbus, is returning to produce and direct the flick.</p>

 <p><a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/movies/movie-news/gremlins-3-final-destination-screenwriters-1236371957/">As reported by<em> The Hollywood Reporter</em></a><em>,</em> Zach Lipovsky and Adam B. Stein are working alongside Columbus to help write the script for <em>Gremlins 3</em>. The duo previously directed this year’s smash hit horror sequel <em>Final Destinations: Bloodlines.</em></p>

 <p>Warner Bros. has set a November 19, 2027 release date for its new <em>Gremlins</em> sequel. That is 37 years after the last <em>Gremlins</em> movie, making it a true legacy sequel.&nbsp; Arriving in theaters in 1984, the original <em>Gremlins</em> was a massive box office success. On a budget of just $15 million, the Joe Dante-directed comedy-horror movie about evil little creatures who show up after some rules are broken while taking care of a cute furry mogwai made over $150 million in the US alone.</p>

 <p>However, six years later, <em>Gremlins 2</em>, also directed by Dante, only made $41 million, was ravaged by critics and fans and basically killed the franchise. In 2023, WB produced an animated series based on the dormant property and it seems the response to that was strong enough to convince the studio that <em>Gremlins</em> is still a worthwhile franchise. Let’s hope the third movie sticks to puppets and doesn’t go full CG.</p> <p>And I hope working on <em>Gremlins 3</em> will help Spielberg get over Activision denying him the chance to make a <em>Call of Duty</em> movie.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Amazon Clears Out Its Fire TV Soundbar Plus, Now Cheaper Than a Mini Bluetooth Speaker]]></title>
            <link>https://kotaku.com/amazon-clears-out-its-fire-tv-soundbar-plus-now-cheaper-than-a-mini-bluetooth-speaker-2000641681</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/amazon-clears-out-its-fire-tv-soundbar-plus-now-cheaper-than-a-mini-bluetooth-speaker.1345807/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>TVs are getting thinner and that’s terrific for aesthetic purposes but disastrous for audio quality. Those razor-thin screens don’t have any physical room for decent speakers which means most integrated audio sounds flat, tinny and lifeless.</p>
<p>Amazon definitely noticed this gap in the market and decided to create a solution that’s largely inspired by premium brands like Bose and Samsung – except the Fire TV soundbar <em>Plus</em> costs two to three times less than comparable models from those manufacturers. At the moment, <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4053/">you can score this soundbar for just $174, down from its usual $249 sticker</a>, which puts it at an <strong>all-time low</strong>.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4053/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Serious Audio Upgrades</h2>
<p>The Fire TV soundbar Plus is a fantastic soundbar that houses <strong>real home theater technology inside a single sleek unit</strong> sitting neatly below your television. This is a 3.1 channel system which means you get three forward-firing speakers combined with a built-in subwoofer for bass in one compact unit. The dedicated center channel <strong>takes care of dialogue specifically</strong> so that if people are talking in movies or shows, the conversations come across sharp and clear rather than being blurred with background music and effects.</p>
<p><strong>Dolby Atmos support brings 3D audio into the mix</strong>&nbsp;with the sensation that sound is moving around and above you rather than just blasting straight ahead. Action scenes feature helicopters flying overhead, atmospheric dramas rain from above, and much more. <strong>Support for DTS:X multi-dimensional audio processing</strong> for filmmakers and sound designers gives multiple ways to create immersive experiences that this soundbar can actually reproduce.</p>



<p>Special attention is given to the <strong>built-in subwoofer as most soundbars in this price range either forgo bass altogether or use a separate wireless subwoofer</strong> that requires floor space and its own power outlet. Amazon manages to house the sub directly within the chassis of the soundbar and with it, you gain deep, punchy low frequencies for everything from explosions to music and ambient rumble-all without adding another component to your setup.</p>



<p>Setup couldn’t be any easier since you only have to hook up the included HDMI cable to your TV’s HDMI eARC or ARC port. The same cable carries both audio and control signals, which means the remote from your television can change the soundbar’s volume for you with no unnecessary controller cluttering up your coffee table. Audio sync issues that plague some soundbar setups simply don’t happen here, since the HDMI connection keeps everything perfectly timed.</p>
<p>It’s compact enough to fit under most TVs without blocking the screen or the remote sensor and has an understated design that lets your entertainment take center stage. For the price, you’re getting tech and performance that’s regularly between $400-$600 from other established audio brands which makes this one of the single best value propositions in home audio at the moment. And for an all-time low price, it’s an even easier decision.</p>
