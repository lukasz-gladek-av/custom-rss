              <p>External storage needs have exploded as file sizes balloon with 4K video and high-resolution photos that exceed what internal drives can handle. Samsung recently launched their T9 portable SSDs with improved durability features but the performance gap compared to the T7 is minimal for most users while the price difference is substantial.</p>
<p>That makes the T7 SSD the smarter choice for anyone prioritizing value without sacrificing speed or capacity. Prime Big Deal Day<a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4613/"> has pushed the 2TB Samsung T7 down to $129 from its usual $187 price, which marks an all-time low</a> that makes premium portable storage genuinely affordable. This <strong>Prime-exclusive offer</strong> expires tonight, giving members just hours to grab what remains the most popular external SSD on the market.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4613/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>True Speed and Capacity that Matter</h2>
<p>The Samsung T7 PCIe NVMe technology<strong> can read at up to 1,050 MB/s, and write at up to 1,000 MB/s</strong>, translating to transferring a 50GB video project in just under a minute. Compare that with slower external hard drives plodding along at 120 MB/s and you know why creatives have left spinning platters behind. It makes <strong>the T7 roughly twice as fast as Samsung’s own previous T5</strong>, which is a significant leap that affects your workflow every time you transfer large files.</p>



<p>The 2TB size is just the sweet spot for the average user and offers enough storage room for full-scale libraries of videos, massive collections of photographs or complete sets of computer games without requiring frequent housekeeping. With 2TB, you never have the hassle of rotating files around or determining which ones need deleting as new material arrives. Samsung sells the T7 in capacities as high as 4TB, but the 2TB is the best-value-per-gigabyte at current price points.</p>
<p><strong>Built-in direct video recording abilities</strong> turn the T7 from just storage into a production device: Plug it into compatible cameras or smartphones and capture Ultra High Definition 4K video at 60 frames per second directly to the drive. You can use the iPhone 17 Pro’s ProRes video mode to shoot directly onto the T7 and <strong>skip the phone’s small internal storage</strong> and allowing you to capture multiple hours of professional quality video without clogging up your phone.</p>



<p>The T7’s solid aluminum unibody construction provides <strong>shock resistance with drop protection tested up to 6 feet</strong>. This metal chassis serves double duty by acting as a heatsink that dissipates the heat generated during sustained high-speed transfers, preventing thermal throttling that could slow performance. The compact design measures roughly the size of a credit card and weighs just 0,13lbs/58 grams.</p>
<p>Universal compatibility eliminates the typical hassles of formatting drives for other systems: The <strong>T7 is compatible with Windows PCs, Macs, Android smartphones, and gaming consoles</strong> via the USB 3.2 Gen 2 interface without a hitch. Samsung ships the drive with both the USB-C to C and the USB-C to A cable, providing the capability of plugging into both new and old devices without scrambling for adapters. The drive comes<strong> shipped in the exFAT format</strong>, which is read-compatible on virtually all contemporary operating systems without reformating.</p>
<p>At a price of $129 in the 2TB version, you pay approximately 6 cents per gigbyte on storage that reads the data at almost ten times the speed that the mechanical drives read the data. Keep in mind, this Prime Big Deal Day price ends tonight.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/amazon-hits-amd-hard-ryzen-7-9700x-cpu-is-now-going-for-50-less-than-the-previous-model.1319368/</guid>

              <p>Building (or upgrading) a gaming PC means making smart choices about where to invest your budget and the processor sits at the heart of everything. AMD’s Ryzen 7 9700X occupies that sweet spot in their lineup where you get serious performance without crossing into extreme enthusiast territory. This 8-core chip from the latest Zen 5 architecture delivers the processing muscle needed for modern gaming and content creation while staying within reach for most builders. Right now, Prime members <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4607/">can grab this processor for just $250 instead of its usual $359 price</a>, but there’s a catch: <strong>this Prime Big Deal Day offer expires tonight</strong>, which makes this your last chance to secure an all-time low on <strong>one of AMD’s newest desktop chips</strong>.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4607/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Perfect for Gaming</h2>
<p>The <strong>Ryzen 7 9700X packs 8 cores and 16 threads into your system</strong>, a setup that is no stranger to multitasking and still capable of providing the single-threaded performance that games require. That <strong>5.5 GHz maximum boost frequency means the CPU can increase speed when needed,</strong> accelerating frames in fast-paced games where milliseconds matter. AMD says this part can produce <strong>over 100 FPS in mainstream games</strong> which is supported by the Zen 5 design’s gains in instructions per clock cycle over the previous gen.</p>



<p>The unlockable multiplier gives enthusiasts freedom to <strong>further tune performance through overclocking</strong>. In this manner, you can increase the clock speed beyond the factory level if you have enough cooling, wringing out additional performance from the chip for work that benefits from sheer frequency. The <strong>combined 40 MB cache appears as ultra-fast memory on the very processor die</strong>, and reduces the time that the CPU is sitting idle waiting on data from the system RAM. This amount of cache is key to gaming, as the CPU is always reaching into the texture data, the logic of the game, and the asset files.</p>
<p>DDR5-5600 future-proofs your build by providing support for the newest memory standard. DDR5 has a greater bandwidth compared to DDR4 which translates into more data being transferred between your RAM and CPU per second. It pays dividends on everything from loading times in games through to video rendering, where large data sets require endless shuffling.</p>



<p>Socket AM5 compatibility matters because AMD has committed to supporting this platform through future processor generations. This means you can upgrade to <strong>newer Ryzen chips down the road without replacing your motherboard</strong>, and protect your investment in the platform. The processor <strong>supports PCIe 5.0 on compatible motherboards</strong>, doubling the bandwidth available for graphics cards and NVMe SSDs compared to PCIe 4.0.</p>
<p>The Ryzen 7 9700X is AMD’s mainstream performance option among the Ryzen 7 offerings: It is under the high-core-count offerings like the 9900X and 9950X that target content creators and professionals but over the budget-friendly Ryzen 5 chips that have 6 cores. Where that places the 9700X is in the sweet spot between gamers who want excellent frame rates and have enough oomph left over for streaming or side work like editing video.</p>
<p>Over 2,000 units have been sold in the past thirty days, and <strong>a score of 4.8 stars through virtually 1,500 reviews</strong>, buyers absolutely love what their new CPU is bringing home. You’re saving $109 off the regular price when you pay just $250, but remember that t<strong>his deal ends when the special Prime Big Deal Day ends tonight</strong>.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/samsungs-990-evo-plus-ssd-is-going-for-pennies-amazon-clears-out-its-excess-stock-at-a-record-low-price-2000633103</link>

              <p>Storage limitations can kill productivity faster than almost anything else in the digital age. Running out of space means constant file juggling, deleted projects you might need later and that dreaded warning message interrupting your workflow at the worst possible moment.</p>
<p>This is where a high-capacity internal SSD becomes essential and today is your final chance to grab an exceptional deal: <strong>Prime Big Deal Day ends tonight</strong>, and Prime members can <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4606/">get the Samsung 990 Evo Plus SSD with a massive 4TB capacity for just $199, down from its regular $327 price</a>. This all-time low represents a serious opportunity to supercharge your PC or laptop with professional-grade storage.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4606/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Why This Drive Transforms Your PC Experience</h2>
<p>The Samsung 990 Evo Plus brings performance that really changes the way you work with massive files and intensive apps. It <strong>reads sequentially at up to 7,250 MB/s and writes at up to 6,300 MB/s</strong>, figures that equate to real-world performance gains you can appreciate today. <strong>Moving a 50GB video project that can take a few minutes on a hard drive takes just seconds here</strong>.</p>
<p>Those data-transfer rates derive from Samsung’s latest-generation NAND memory technology which is the pinnacle of storage chip engineering. On the interface side, the drive is compatible with <strong>both the PCIe 4.0 x4 and the PCIe 5.0 x2 interface</strong> which translates into the drive auto-adapting to the capability of the motherboard and always providing optimum bandwidth no matter what gen the system is compatible with.</p>



<p>The 4TB capacity resolves the storage bottleneck that creative professionals and power users experience on a regular basis. Today’s game installs easily surpass 100GB, and the 4K video files and high-def photo libraries devour terabytes before you know it. This much storage on one drive obviates the need for external storage wrangling or the maintenance of multiple small drives. Samsung’s Intelligent Turbowrite 2.0 technology streamlines the way the drive approaches large file operations by providing a high-performance buffer that boosts write speed under high-workload conditions.</p>



<p>Thermal management is what distinguishes quality SSDs from the ones that throttle performance when they get hot: The 990 Evo Plus employs a nickel-coated efficiency-specific controller that enables <strong>the drive to reach optimal speed without consuming more power than the earlier generations</strong>. This is crucially important to laptop users whose battery life is critical, as well as desktop builders whoseheat build-up can cause system instability.</p>
<p>Samsung includes with every shipment their <em>Magician Software</em> suite which contains utilities that keep your SSD in top form long after installation. Drive health is monitored through tracking lifetime left and durability-based performance metrics, giving warnings before data loss is possible. Firmware updates also arrive automatically through Magician, ensuring that your drive benefits from Samsung’s newest developments and security patches. More still, the software contains further encryption utilities for safeguarding vital data as well as performance optimization tools that tailor the interaction between the drive and the OS.</p>
<p>More than 9,000 units have been sold in the last month alone and, <strong>following a 4.8-star rating through more than 7,000 reviews</strong>, the 990 Evo Plus has firmly secured itself among intensive users. At $199 per 4TB, you’re <strong>getting approximately 5 cents per gig</strong>, which is brilliant value for such performance. Note that this Prime-member deal is gone after tonight when the Prime Big Deal Day ends, so the price window is very small.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[For the Closing Hours of Prime Day, Amazon Sells Pokemon Card Packs for Just $0.10]]></title>
            <link>https://kotaku.com/for-the-closing-hours-of-prime-day-amazon-sells-pokemon-card-packs-for-just-0-10-2000633099</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/for-the-closing-hours-of-prime-day-amazon-sells-pokemon-card-packs-for-just-0-10.1319344/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Building a Pokemon card collection doesn’t have to drain your wallet and right now might be the perfect time to jump in: The trading card craze has sparked fresh enthusiasm across all generations, from kids discovering these iconic creatures for the first time to adults rekindling their childhood passion. <strong>Amazon’s Prime Big Deal Day</strong> is wrapping up today, and there’s a standout offer that everyone can grab, Prime member or not: <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4271/">this assorted lot of 50 Pokemon cards has dropped to just $5, down from its usual $10 price tag</a>. It’s an all-time low that makes expanding your collection incredibly affordable.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4271/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<p>This collection ships exactly as collectors require without the hassle of searching outlets individually at high-end premium prices. You <strong>receive 50 randomly selected cards taken from the entirety of the Pokemon universe</strong>, <strong>covering every series issued</strong>. You get regular character cards as well as energy cards, which provides usable items suitable for actual play as well as collectibles that fans love.</p>
<p><strong>Duplicates will be found in the randomized sets</strong>, but that is part of the trade that collectors appreciate as they trade the excess with buddies or utilize them towards completing certain deck layouts.</p>
<h2>What Makes This Collection Pack Worth Getting</h2>
<p>The true value here is beyond the rock-bottom price: Each lot is like a surprise package as the cards include random series which can have <strong>anything ranging from vintage Base Set designs to recent releases</strong>. Randomization is something that works favorably in the case of <strong>new collectors</strong> establishing a good base without the need to have encyclopedic information on sets that need to be targeted. For parents introducing children to the concept, it is an affordable method of giving enough cards towards building multiple decks and testing out varied strategies.</p>



<p>The 50-card quantity is just the right size for collection expansion: It’s high enough that it is something significant that you can feel like you’ve accomplished something without being too overwhelming that new collectors don’t know quite what to do with them. Advanced collectors will pick these lots up just as a way to fill missing cards they have from past-generation sets or fill out common cards, which are often needed as part of building out a tournament-legal deck. Because the sets span all generations, you’re handling the initial 151 creatures through the latest expansion sets that include recent release games.</p>
<p>At $5 for Prime Day, <strong>you’re getting roughly 10 cents per card</strong>, which seriously undercuts what you would pay buying single cards or even regular booster packs at retail stores. Because today is the final day that the Prime Big Deal Day concludes, these prices will not last.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[What’s With This New KPop Demon Hunters Song On Spotify?]]></title>
            <link>https://kotaku.com/kpop-demon-hunters-huntrix-spotify-new-song-mazatlan-by-night-2000632680</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/what%E2%80%99s-with-this-new-kpop-demon-hunters-song-on-spotify.1319260/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Ejae, Rei Ami, and Audrey Nuna are set to perform on&nbsp;<em>The Tonight Show</em> in just a few hours, which will mark the trio’s first live performance as Huntr/x, the pop stars from <a href="https://kotaku.com/kpop-demon-hunters-best-worst-songs-soundtrack-ranking-2000616633"><em>KPop Demon Hunters</em></a>. (At least, not counting <a href="https://youtu.be/LW9QJIT_T-A?si=mK7N33Yd-8Q2GEnz">a cameo in a skit</a> during this weekend’s <em>Saturday Night Live </em>in which they didn’t even perform a full song.) But in advance of that debut performance later tonight, the band has released a new song with no fanfare, one that wasn’t featured in the Netflix musical. Or at least that’s what Spotify is currently indicating. The <a href="https://open.spotify.com/artist/2yNNYQBChuox9A5Ka93BIn?si=bD2voW0ITLeASfThiMvk-g">Huntr/x Spotify account</a> posted a song called “Mazatlan By Night” on Sunday, and it’s only accumulated about 6,000 listens so far. Considering <a href="https://kotaku.com/kpop-demon-hunters-streaming-box-office-numbers-netflix-2000622381">how big <em>KPop Demon Hunters&nbsp;</em>has become</a> in the past few months, you’d think a new song from the titular girl group would have exploded in even just a few days. So what’s up with this song? Well, for one thing, it doesn’t seem to actually be a Huntr/x song.</p>

 <p>Sometimes other artists’ work will appear on a group’s Spotify page if they’re featured or if one of their songs is sampled, but I’ve listened to the <em>KPop Demon Hunters&nbsp;</em>soundtrack hundreds of times and couldn’t pick out anything from this piece that would put Huntr/x anywhere near the credits. I tried using the Shazam app, which listens to music and gives you the title, and it couldn’t identify the song as anything, much less a new song by Rumi, Zoey, and Mira. This could have been uploaded to the Huntr/x account in error, or there might be something more nefarious going on. The song’s copyright is for “Diskerux Diamond,” which doesn’t bring up any search results on Google. Well, it might bring up this article now. We’ve reached out to Universal Music Group for comment on the situation and will update the story if we hear back.</p>  <p>It’s entirely possible the account was hacked and someone uploaded this song to the Huntr/x account without authorization. Or it could have been a technical error that…somehow ended up on the Spotify page of one of the biggest groups in music right now. Sorry to the 6,000 of you that listened to it expecting something new from the girls. But hey, at least we’ll get to hear them performing “Golden” live on <em>The Tonight Show</em> in a little bit.</p>
