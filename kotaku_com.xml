              <p>No one likes to deal with low storage, and sometimes even a terabyte or two just isn’t enough to keep up with everything you need to save. If you’re after a long-term fix and your storage needs have outgrown the usual upgrade options, the Seagate Expansion 14TB external hard drive might be just what you need.</p>
<p>It usually runs you around $300, but right now, you can grab it for $230 on Amazon, after a 16% discount from its regular price. This is the lowest price we have seen it go for in a while, but the offer is going to end soon. Get your orders in before the price shoots back up!</p>

<h2>Massive Storage for All Your Old and New Files</h2>
<p>14 terabytes is no joke. That’s enough capacity to house hundreds of movies, a million photos, and numerous work documents for years to come. If your storage needs are consistently growing (as everyone else’s) and you don’t want to find yourself in the same situation every few months, this is a nice long-term solution. Think having your entire digital library – both old and new stuff – in one portable build that goes wherever you do.</p>
<p>Getting started is simple. Plug in the adapter it comes with, connect the USB 3.0 cable, and it’s ready to go. File transfers are quick as well. Grab all that you need to transfer, drag it over it, and drop. It works well with both Windows and Mac, but Mac users will need to reformat it for use with Time Machine. There are no complicated drivers or setup procedures to worry about. It literally takes a few minutes to get everything going, even if it’s your first time with an external drive.</p>



<p>You’re also getting Rescue Data Recovery Services with the purchase. In case of water damage or a natural disaster, Seagate’s team can help recover your important files in no time. Included in the box are a Seagate Expansion desktop drive, an 18-inch USB 3.0 cable, an 18W power adapter, and a quick start guide.</p>
<p>All in all, if you’re looking for a storage solution that can take care of all your old and new data, this 14TB SSD will be a great addition to your work setup. The storage capacity is massive, so you won’t have to worry about running out of space again for years to come. The offer ends soon, so be sure to act fast to grab it for less.</p>
