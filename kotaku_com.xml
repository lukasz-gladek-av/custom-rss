              <p>It’s a fairly safe bet that even if you’re a huge <em>Star Wars</em> fan, you’ve never seen these six characters from&nbsp;<em>The Phantom Menace</em> like this before. That’s because Anakin Skywalker, Queen Amidala, Qui-Gon Jinn, and the others have assumed LEGO BrickHeadz form in <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4638/">this eye-grabbing and fun LEGO Star Wars set that’s marked down by 31% in a new Prime Big Deal.&nbsp;</a></p>
<p>This cool set for kids 10 and up contains six collectible buildable characters — Anakin, Amidala, Qui-Gon, Darth Maul, Captain Panaka, and Jar Jar Binks, each with movie-authentic details in BrickHeadz form. In total there are 732 pieces, with each figure measuring over 2.5 inches high, 1.5 inches wide, and 2 inches deep. Each has its own baseplate, and some have their own accessories like young Anakin’s hammer and Darth Maul’s double-bladed red lightsaber. Once built, these unique collectible figures are more displayable than playable, and make great decorations or conversation pieces.</p>

<h2>Great Anytime Gift</h2>
<p>It’s never too early to start thinking about the holidays and knocking items off your list, but this LEGO BrickHeadz The Phantom Menace set is a terrific anytime present — birthday, great report card, or just a thoughtful gift for a young <em>Star Wars</em> fan in your life. The six BrickHeadz figures are fun for boys and girls age 10 and up to build, and then great decorations for any kid’s bedroom.</p>
<p>Even in the fun and unique-looking BrickHeadz form, the detail LEGO adds to these six figures from&nbsp;<em>The Phantom Menace</em> is exceptionally cool. Anakin Skywalker comes in his podracing outfit, while Queen Amidala’s dress comes with gem elements to snap in place. All 10 of Darth Maul’s horns are in place, and Qui-Gon Jinn’s Jedi outfit is easily recognized.</p>



<h2>Unanimous Reviews</h2>
<p>All of the Amazon reviews on the LEGO BrickHeadz The Phantom Menace collectible set are raves — it’s one of the very rare Amazon items that has a unanimous 5-star rating, but then again, how can you go wrong with Star Wars figures from LEGO? This is also a collectible set, part of LEGO’s larger 25th anniversary celebration of both&nbsp;<em>The Phantom Menace</em> being released in theaters and the first LEGO Star Wars building sets being released in stores.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4638/">The Prime Big Deal at Amazon takes 31% off the price of the LEGO BrickHeadz The Phantom Menace collectible set, bringing it from its usual $55 all the way down to just $38.</a> But, as with all of these Prime Day deals, you’re on borrowed time. Once Prime Day’s over, so is this Prime Big Deal.</p>

              <p>It’s quite the pickle. You’ve got a well-loved 2016 indie hit, and you figured it’d be nice to make it free on Steam for a bit. But then, a good while later, you decide it’s time to give it a graphical overhaul, update it with a whole new online multiplayer mode, and start charging a little bit for all that work. Except, nope. It seems there’s a limit for how many times you can switch your game from free to paid. So, as <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/beloved-co-operative-platformer-pico-park-classic-edition-has-been-accidentally-made-free-on-steam-forever">spotted by&nbsp;<em>Eurogamer</em></a>, Tecopark’s <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/461040/PICO_PARKClassic_Edition/"><em>Pico Park: Classic Edition</em></a> and its new multiplayer mode is stuck at free, and will always be.</p> <p>Japanese developer Tecopark’s&nbsp;<em>Pico Park</em> games have proven hugely popular multiplayer games over the last ten years. Alongside the&nbsp;<em>Classic</em> version, there’s 2021’s re-imagined&nbsp;<em>Pico Park</em>, and most recently 2024’s&nbsp;<em>Pico Park 2</em>. They’re all cooperative puzzle games for between two and eight players, in which you’re challenged to collect a level’s keys via collaborative platform action. As you might imagine, this can become chaotic extremely quickly as groups attempt to arrange their cute cat-like characters into stacked piles to reach platforms, or assign themselves to pressing multiple buttons at once to open doors. And in the <em>Classic</em> version, that madness could go up to as many as 10 players. Albeit, until recently, only in local multiplayer.</p>

 <p>Tecopark’s Shunsuke Miyake posted to the game’s Updates page on August 20, “I’m thinking of updating&nbsp;<em>Classic Edition</em> for the first time in nine years… Since I’m doing it anyway, I’ll update it with online support.” He added, “<wbr>I might charge a small fee for it. I recommend installing it while it’s still free.”</p>

 <p>Come September 13, that update had happened, and the game now had art that matches its two sequels, ran on monitors running over 60Hz, added Steam inputs, and most significantly, now included online multiplayer. Miyake added, “We’ll keep it free for about a week.” Which was pretty generous!</p>

 <p>Then this last weekend, a new update appeared. The title is “<em>PICO PARK&nbsp;: Classic Edition</em> is permanently free!” with the text explaining this change.</p> <blockquote><p>“I was planning to switch to a paid plan after updating the online support, but I forgot that once you switch from paid to free, I can never go back to paid! : )”</p></blockquote> <p>He then adds, “If you enjoy playing this free version, be sure to try the series (<em>PICO PARK</em>, <em>PICO PARK 2</em>) too.”</p>

 <p>The 2021 version of <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1509960/PICO_PARK/"><em>Pico Park</em></a> was an updated port of the Switch’s 2019 game (keep notes, there’s a test at the end), with all-new levels and online multiplayer, along with a bunch of new modes and ways to play. It even lets you use your phone as a controller for party gaming around one screen, rather than forcing you into the hassle of hooking up eight Xbox controllers at once.</p>

 <p>Last September’s&nbsp;<a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2644470/PICO_PARK_2/"><em>Pico Park 2</em></a> offered a brand new set of levels, along with all the previous features, including cross-platform support. Both games are extremely well received, eliciting very creative Steam reviews from people broken by their experiences. “This is the game where friendships go to DIE,” says one positive review. Another says, “this game ruined my relationships with all my friends and I am now left alone. Great game.” My personal favorite reads, “You get to see who’s stupid among your friends, then realize it was you all along.”</p> <p>And now, it seems, you can experience the original version of all this in its prettier glory, and online, for free! Poor ol’ Tecopark. For real, go buy a sequel if you enjoy it! Poor people just wanted to make a well-earned buck. Honestly, they should add it as a free game on Itch.io too, where at least people can then choose to pay for it if they want to.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/roborock-qv-35a-at-40-off-eliminates-cleaning-stress-now-cheaper-than-a-mid-range-stick-vacuum-2000633175</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/roborock-qv-35a-at-40-off-eliminates-cleaning-stress-now-cheaper-than-a-mid-range-stick-vacuum.1319806/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Roborock has built its reputation as the premium brand in robot vacuums but that prestige comes with a price tag. Most of their newer models sail past the $1,000 mark and puts serious automated cleaning out of reach for many households. The <strong>Qrevo QV 35A</strong> breaks that pattern as one of Roborock’s more accessible options, especially during Amazon’s<em> Prime Big Deal Days</em> <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4636/">where it’s dropped to $399, down from $649</a>. This <strong>Prime-exclusive deal expires tonight</strong> and gives you limited time to snag a high-end robot vacuum and mop combo.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4636/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<p>The 8,000Pa sucking power places this unit in the high-end level of cleaning power that is robust enough that it <strong>can suck out ground-in dirt from carpet fibers and snatch up debris from hardwood grout lines</strong>. Most entry-level bot vacs hover around the 3,000-4,000Pa level so this unit provides almost triple the force, which makes a major difference on carpets or homes with pets that continuously shed. The <strong>new-generation anti-tangle brushes</strong> resolve one of the pain points with owning a robot vacuum by eliminating the tendency for the brush bar to wrap around with hairs.</p>
<h2>The All-in-One Dock Does the Dirty Work</h2>
<p>The real value comes from the <strong>all-in-one docking station that handles mop washing automatically</strong>. After cleaning, the robot returns to its dock where the station washes the dual spinning mops with clean water, and removes the grime they’ve picked up. This means you’re not dragging dirty mops across your floors on subsequent cleaning sessions. The mops spin at 200 RPM and creates mechanical scrubbing action that tackles stuck-on spills and stains rather than just wiping moisture around.</p>
<p>The <strong>self-emptying dustbin is what makes the system hands-off</strong>, really. The dock self-sucks messes out of the internal dustbin on the robot into a larger bag back at the base station. You <strong>can abandon the vacuum for weeks on end</strong> as the base can accommodate as much as seven weeks’ worth of accumulated dirt and dust, depending on the size of your home and mess level. Dump the bag every month or every two months instead of dealing with a small dustbin after every cleaning pass.</p>



<p>What’s more, <strong>intelligent collision avoidance employs sensors and AI detection</strong> to steer around typical floor hazards such as shoes, wires, pet toys or unexpected spills. It illustrates the layout of your home during initial uses, and becomes familiar with the best cleaning paths and retaining room boundaries. No-go areas can be designated via the app which can be programmed to schedule varying cleaning modes per room or time of day.</p>
<p>The mop function provides real added value beyond ordinary vacuuming: The water tank maintains a stable moisture level on the spinning mops, appropriate for sealed hardwood, tile, laminate, or vinyl flooring. Water flow can be varied as appropriate to floor type or how grimy your floors become on average. Vacuum-then-mop, all in one automated pass, saves the time that would be taken on separate passages.</p>
<p>This Roborock at $399 comes with features that would be common on $800-1,000 units from the same company. Just the all-in-one dock would be a few hundred as a separate accessory on lower-end bots. This is the <strong>Prime-member deal that ends tonight</strong>, so grab yours before the price goes back up.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/lego-clears-out-harry-potter-stock-hagrids-hut-selling-for-mere-pennies-2000633202</link>

              <p>Here’s something that doesn’t happen often: a LEGO Harry Potter set on sale. These sets are among the most popular in the entire LEGO catalog and discounts are rare. When you find one with stellar reviews like this <strong>Hagrid’s Hut set</strong> (which boasts an impressive 4.9 out of 5 stars), it’s even more unusual.</p>
<p>Right now, during the final hours of Prime Big Deal Day, <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4642/">this popular set has dropped to $41 on Amazon, down from $74 (44% off) which marks an all-time low price</a>. This<strong> deal is exclusively for Prime members</strong>, and there’s no guarantee it’ll return before the holidays roll around.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4642/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<p>Hagrid’s Hut is one of the most emotive locations in the Wizarding World, the site of Harry’s initial revelations about his magical parentage and the setting of many indelible scenes across the series. For collectors and fans, recreating these scenes is one way that the magic can be brought home in tangible form. This is a masterful capture of the barely-tamed feel of Hagrid’s mountain hut with incredible attention to every little detail.</p>
<h2>Seven Characters and a Dragon Bring the Scene to Life</h2>
<p>The real magic is the character list. You get the complete roster of <strong>seven characters: Harry Potter, Hermione Granger, Ron Weasley, Draco Malfoy, and Rubeus Hagrid as mini-figures</strong>, plus LEGO interpretations of Norbert,<strong> the baby dragon, and Fang, the loyal boarhound of Hagrid</strong>. With these, kids can reproduce the iconic scene in The Philosopher’s Stone when Harry and his pals discover Hagrid openly incubating a dragon’s egg in secret.</p>



<p>The hut itself is a happy size for play and has beautifully considered design elements that make the building experience all the more fun. It’s easy to access the inside without becoming frustrated <strong>thanks to the removable roof</strong> and the building opens wide to show the detailed interior. Hagrid’s trademark oversized furniture consists of his foldout chair that are beautifully proportioned to his half-giant frame. There is an umbrella stand on which his noted pink umbrella (which actually contains his broken wand) would sit, and the key dragon egg element waits to crack open. <strong>Fang’s doghouse sits separate</strong>&nbsp;and provides depth to the scene as well as the possibility of play scenarios outdoors.</p>



<p>One particularly nice touch is the random inclusion of <strong>two gold-plated portrait elements</strong>: They are among a group of 14 collectible Hogwarts portraits that extend across multiple LEGO Harry Potter sets.</p>
<p>The <strong>collection is made up of 465 pieces</strong> and offers multiple hours of fun building time suitable for children aged 8 and above. Complexity falls just in that golden zone between challenging enough that it is rewarding without being tough enough that little builders get stuck.</p>
<p>At this all-time low price, you’re getting incredible value. Those seven characters, two buildings, and the collectible portrait pieces individually would easily merit the whole $74 price. For parents searching for a Halloween special, birthday, or early holiday gift, the deal is the best chance this year to acquire this specific set without breaking the budget.</p>
