              <p>Halloween is only a couple short weeks away, then comes Thanksgiving, the December holidays, New Years, Valentine’s Day. It never ends. Decorating your house might mean stringing up a bunch of lights only to take them down a few weeks later. Then stringing up another set of lights the glow a different color a few weeks after that? Rinse and repeat. What you need is a permanent fixture of outdoor lights for your house that work both on and off the holiday seasons. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4637/">The Govee Permanent Outdoor Lights Pro are exactly what you’re looking for. Right now, Amazon has them for as much as $280 off.</a></p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4637/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Light Show All Year Long</h2>
<p>The magic of these lights is they are multi-color LEDs. So you can string them along the underside edge of your roof or wrapped around your front porch columns. Have them glow orange and purple for Halloween, then go back to a warm white. Then make them green and red when Christmas rolls around, then back to that warm white. February hits, have them go pink, purple and red, then pivot into green for St. Patrick’s Day, and back to a warm white for the rest of Spring. You get the picture.</p>
<p>The lights are built for the outdoors, water and weather proof so you can keep them up year-round. Installation is simple. You can use the provided HB glue and clips to install each. The product page estimates each one only takes 8 seconds to do.</p>



<p>Being Alexa-supported means you can set these lights on a schedule without lifting a finger. Have them come on during specific times, or change their color just by asking you Echo Dot.</p>
<p>The Govee Permanent Outdoor Lights Pro come in three different sizes and two different colors. Well, the lights themselves can glow any color you want, but you can choose for the cables and casing to be either white or black. Get whichever better matches the facade of your home.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4637/">For the sizes, you can get a set that’s either 100 feet, 150 feet, or 200 feet long. Each length is on sale.</a> The shorter 100-foot lights are now $100 off, coming down from $440 to just $340. The medium-length 150-foot lights are down $210, dropping from $600 to just $390. Then the longer 200-foot lights are down from $760 to just $480 — saving you $280. The lights are cuttable and extendable if you need a length shorter, longer or just not exactly one of those three measurements.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Every modern military shooter doubles as a reward treadmill. Calibrate it too generously and everyone gets bored. Make the grind too steep and stingy, and players bounce off or find ways to cheat the system. A week into <a href="https://kotaku.com/battlefield-6-review-steam-ps5-campaign-multiplayer-2000633379"><em>Battlefield 6</em></a>‘s launch, the development team is tackling that problem by making the XP grind suck less but also nuking the XP farming servers currently flooding the game’s Portal mode custom matchmaking section.</p> <p>“We’ve heard your feedback around the pace of progression, especially how long it can take to unlock hardware such as gadgets, and weapon attachments,” EA announced <a href="https://x.com/BattlefieldComm/article/1979107918185157116">in a new blog post</a>.&nbsp; We know progression is an important part of feeling rewarded for your time on the battlefield.”</p>

 <p>The following changes are expected to arrive sometime in the next week:</p> <blockquote> <ul data-offset-key="71fcn-0-0"> <li data-block="true" data-editor="8qkrt" data-offset-key="71fcn-0-0"> <p><span data-offset-key="71fcn-0-0">The XP gained from match completion and the daily bonus are being increased by 10% and 40% respectively.</span></p> </li> <li data-block="true" data-editor="8qkrt" data-offset-key="35lr9-0-0"> <p><span data-offset-key="35lr9-0-0">The XP needed to unlock the first 20 attachment ranks is being reduced, so you’ll start earning useful attachments almost twice as fast.</span></p> </li> <li data-block="true" data-editor="8qkrt" data-offset-key="d2mu3-0-0"> <p><span data-offset-key="d2mu3-0-0">Please Note: For weapons that are already being progressed, the UI might display something abnormal at first, but this should resolve itself once a match is played while using that weapon.</span></p> </li> <li data-block="true" data-editor="8qkrt" data-offset-key="405lp-0-0"> <p><span data-offset-key="405lp-0-0">The assignments that required career ranks 20, 23, and 26 to begin will now require career ranks 10, 15, and 20, respectively.</span></p> </li> <li data-block="true" data-editor="8qkrt" data-offset-key="ai9re-0-0"> <p><span data-offset-key="ai9re-0-0">While this allows these assignments to be started sooner, we are aware of the frustrations regarding the challenges themselves and are actively working on reviewing them, but it will take more time to develop, test, and implement these changes.</span></p> </li> </ul> </blockquote> <p>Do they go far enough? My gut says it’s a step in the right direction but still not far enough. They’ll also come coupled with EA putting the kibosh on the community XP farm servers fans have been using to quickly rank up and unlock everything.</p>

 <h2>Nuking <em>Battlefield 6</em>‘s best XP farm</h2> <p>In <em>Battlefield 6</em>, as it is in just about every game that’s ever existed, the “right” or “fun” way to play is not the most optimized for progressing through the meta game. In order to quickly unlock some of the best weapons in the game like the PW7A2 SMG and DRS-IAR LMG, <em>Battlefield 6</em> players have been flooding the community server list with private matches against bots where they mow enemies down to grind for new rewards and levels as quickly as possible. If you’ve ever jumped into the community section of matchmaking and been met with a sea of boring bot XP farm servers or the error message “global game quota is exceeded” when you try to create your own, this is why.</p>

 <p>“After reviewing the data, we found that a large number of these servers were created primarily to earn XP, inflate player stats, and earn special accolades through defeating bots,” the development team writes. “We completely understand the motivation behind this, like faster progression and a way to test setups without pressure, but it’s led to some unintended side effects.”</p>

 <p>To combat this issue, EA has teased mysterious “adjustments” that are supposed to get rid of all the XP farms taking up server space while “further emphasizing playing with friends on both custom and verified experiences.” How will that work exactly? The developers aren’t saying yet. This change will require maintenance on the game’s backend, however, and players will need to republish all custom map experiences after it’s live.</p> <p>And don’t worry, EA knows fans are pissed about weapon bloom (bullets randomly missing if you’re too far away, even when you’ve accurately fired at the target) and other community complaints. “We have also seen your concerns on other areas of the game, including visibility, weapon bloom, vehicles not spawning, and more,” the blog post reads. “We’ll share more details on these as updates are determined.”</p>

              <p>Three days ago <a href="https://kotaku.com/borderlands-4-sale-discount-everwild-leak-helldivers-performance-2000635349">Ubisoft announced</a> that <em>Assassin’s Creed </em>head honcho&nbsp;Marc-Alexis Côté was leaving the company. “Marc-Alexis Côté has chosen to pursue a new path elsewhere outside of Ubisoft,” said a spokesperson at the time. Except, now Côté is insisting that’s not how it went down, and that he was in fact “asked to step aside.”</p> <p>Marc-Alexis Côté has been running everything <em>Assassin’s Creed</em> for almost two decades, overseeing a vast number of games in the enormous franchise. But it’s also been a tumultuous time of change for the cash-strapped Ubisoft, leading to March’s announcement of a major <a href="https://kotaku.com/ubisoft-tencent-assassins-creed-far-cry-rainbow-six-1851772796">business relationship with Tencent</a>, in which the French company took a $1.25 billion bailout from the Chinese firm. This led to the announcement of a new co-owned subsidiary that would take over the production of <em>Assassin’s Creed</em>, eventually announced a couple of weeks back as Vantage Studios. The joint-owned venture was created to take over the running of the <em>Assassin’s Creed</em> franchise, its name revealed just a couple of weeks ago. This week, <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/i-did-not-walk-away-former-assassins-creed-boss-says-he-didnt-resign-he-was-asked-to-step-aside-by-ubisoft/">according to&nbsp;<em>VGC</em></a>, an internal memo was sent to staff from Vantage’s co-CEOs Charlie Guillemot and Christophe Derennes stating that Côté was “offered a role as part of Vantage Studios’ leadership, but declined.”</p>

 <p>“Following the organizational restructuring announced in March 2025,” <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/assassins-creed-franchise-boss-departs-ubisoft">Ubisoft told&nbsp;<em>IGN</em> in a statement</a>, “Marc-Alexis Côté has chosen to pursue a new path elsewhere outside of Ubisoft. While we are saddened to see him go, we’re confident that our talented teams will carry forward the strong foundation he helped build.”</p>

 <p>But Côté has now <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7384672277055012864/">taken to his LinkedIn page</a> to claim a very different version of events. “The past 24 hours have been deeply emotional,” his statement begins, sharing that people’s messages sent to him have meant a great deal. However, he noted that a recurring theme in those messages was people’s surprise that he had “chosen” to leave <em>Assassin’s Creed</em>, “especially given the passion I still hold for it.” Except, he says, that’s not what happened. “The truth is simple: I did not make that choice.”</p>

 <p>Reading between the lines of Côté’s post, it seems that the role he was offered by Ubisoft was far more like a demotion. “Ubisoft decided to transfer the leadership of the Assassin’s Creed franchise to someone closer to its new organizational structure,” said the former boss. “A different position was mentioned, but it did not carry the same scope, mandate, or continuity with the work I had been entrusted with in recent years.”</p>

 <p>Insisting he holds no resentment, and still greatly values his time at Ubisoft, Côté is unequivocal in his position:</p> <blockquote><p>“I also owe it to my teams, past and present, to say this plainly:<br> I did not walk away.<br> I stayed at my post until Ubisoft asked me to step aside.”</p></blockquote> <p>Often when long-term leadership are let go companies will issue statements suggesting it was all amicable, not just to save face, but to offer the person leaving the dignity of not looking like they were fired. And it seems technically true that as staff were told, he&nbsp;<em>was</em> offered a leadership role, just one that wasn’t the job he’d had for 20 years and wanted to continue.</p> <p>Similarly, Ubisoft’s statement to&nbsp;<em>IGN</em> isn’t an outright lie, but just ambiguous enough to suggest the decision was Côté’s rather than its own. It’s true that after not wanting to take a likely demotion he <em>did</em> “cho[o]se to pursue a new path elsewhere,” but it’s clearly designed to make everything seem a lot more amicable and positive than it seems it really was. And the consequence of that certainly didn’t work out in Côté’s favor.</p>
