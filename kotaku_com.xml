              <p>LEGO has just rolled out its new Advent calendars, and they’re giving early shoppers a real treat. Every year it’s the same story: prices are friendliest at launch then as December gets closer, demand sends them climbing back up.</p>
<p>Right now, <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4264/">the LEGO Minecraft advent calendar (2025 edition) is going for only $38 instead of the usual $44</a>. No wonder it’s already the fan favorite among all the LEGO calendars this season, from Harry Potter to Star Wars – but <strong>Minecraft is the #1 best-seller on Amazon</strong>.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4264/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<p>LEGO just released its new Advent calendars, and they’re treating early buyers to a welcome bargain. Year after year: prices are kindest at introduction, then closer to December, demand pushes them on the rise. Currently, the LEGO Minecraft Advent Calendar 2025 is available for as low as $38 rather than its normal price of $44.99, which is its lowest ever on Amazon. No wonder it’s already the holiday favorite of all the LEGO calendars available this year, whether it’s Harry Potter or Star Wars—but Minecraft is in the spotlight.</p>



<h2>A Christmas Deal That Brings Minecraft to Life</h2>
<p>Why this set is exciting is pretty simple: children and adults like counting down to Christmas, and LEGO and Minecraft is as good a sure bet as you’re ever likely to get. Instead of a second box of chocolates, <strong>you’re getting 24 buildable surprises</strong> that extend the suspense through the morning.<strong> Constructed from 300 pieces</strong>, the set creates a full-sized Minecraft world to discover one day at a time.</p>



<p><strong>8 classic Minecraft mini-figures are shipped inside</strong>: Alex and Steve are present, of course, but you also get a Creeper, stray, drowned, zombie, snow golem, and even a villager in Santa clothes. They all come with holiday-themed accents that still fit the vibe of the holiday countdown without losing the characteristic Minecraft look.</p>
<p>What’s really cool is <strong>the way the pieces interact with one another</strong>: There’s something new every day and collectively, they build a Minecraft-themed winter village scene. That playmat background in the box acts as the glue to hold everything together so instead of having 24 separate builds, kids see their own Lego world come together over the space of a month.</p>
<p>This Advent calendar isn’t a separate collection: it’s <strong>compatible with the entire range of LEGO Minecraft</strong>. For someone who already has Minecraft Lego pieces lying around, this slots right into the existing collection. Kids can expand on their worlds, bridge scenes together or start with it and build something even bigger.</p>
<p>And there’s more than just nostalgia at play: LEGO calendars like this one don’t stick around at low launch prices. Historically, these drop right around release week before climbing steadily into mid-November, as the frenzy for Advent calendars kicks in. Waiting until December almost guarantees you’ll pay list price—or risk a sell-out altogether.</p>

              <p>After years of development hell, a couple of Ubisoft’s many non-gaming projects appear to be genuinely happening. The <a href="https://kotaku.com/splinter-cell-deathwatch-anime-netflix-2000619516"><em>Splinter Cell</em> animated series</a> begins airing next month after forever in development. Meanwhile, a year after filming was said to be completed on a <em>Watch_Dogs</em> movie, signs of life have appeared in the form of some recent reshoots and the declaration from one of the film’s actors that it’s nothing like the games.</p> <p>Post-production is obviously a lengthy process in projects bursting with CG, with most movies now enlisting the work of multiple SFX studios once shooting has wrapped. But a year without a single piece of news, early teaser, or even a leak still makes you wonder, especially as this silence came after <a href="https://kotaku.com/watch-dogs-movie-live-action-film-ubisoft-decade-later-1851575957">the extraordinary ten-year gap</a> between the <a href="https://kotaku.com/watch-dogs-isnt-out-yet-but-theres-a-movie-in-the-wo-1172993658">film’s announcement</a> and actually getting it in the can. However, news of reshoots <a href="https://screenrant.com/watch-dogs-movie-game-tom-blyth-comparison/">reported by&nbsp;<em>ScreenRant</em></a> suggests things are definitely still progressing. What’s more intriguing, however, is the claim from the movie’s lead, Tom Blyth, that the result is “very different” from the source material. “It’s not the game,” he says.</p> <p>That might immediately sound bad, because films that have wandered far from their original point tend to be aimless, meandering noise. But <em>Watch_Dogs</em> didn’t exactly have a memorable storyline, and is best remembered for its hacking within an all-consuming surveillance system, so ideally the film would lean successfully in this direction: thwarting the underground criminal world of Chicago through grey-hat hacking. It would have been great if it could have offered us this without fridging the protagonist’s niece at the start for some deeply lazy motivation, but there’s plenty there to serve as the basis for an action romp with a sci-fi edge.</p>

 <p>Blyth (speaking to&nbsp;<em>ScreenRant</em> about his current movie&nbsp;<em>Plainclothes</em>) expanded a little. “They’ve done an amazing job of making…I don’t want to spoil too much. I’m trying to pick my words carefully, but they’ve done an amazing job of making the game into a film. It feels very film. It doesn’t feel like they’ve tried to copy and paste the game onto the screen. It feels like its own thing, and it feels like the beginning of a world-building exercise.”</p>

 <p>It feels very film.</p> <p>Super-fans of the original game might be disappointed to not get a highly faithful cinematic retelling of it, but given <em>Watch_Dogs</em> released in 2014, the vast majority of people have forgotten the story entirely. An exciting movie set in the world of hacking, surveillance and untouched criminal networks sounds like it could entertain me well enough, should director Mathieu Turi do a half-decent job with it all. Turi is still something of an unknown quantity, having been AD on movies like <em>Inglorious Basterds</em> and the <a href="https://www.metacritic.com/movie/united-passions/">infamously terrible</a>&nbsp;<em>United Passions</em>, with just 2020’s&nbsp;<em>Meander</em> seeing him succeed at the helm. (His other films have not troubled the attention of critics.)</p> <p>But, if nothing else, we know the&nbsp;<em>Watch_Dogs</em> movie feels, at the least, very film.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/disney-plus-price-raising-bluey-season-4-jimmy-kimmel-2000627947</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/disney-chose-a-wild-time-to-hike-everyone%E2%80%99s-subscription-prices.1305654/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Are you ready to pay more for <em>Bluey</em>? Disney thinks so. The company has announced it’s raising prices for a bunch of its subscription tiers <a href="https://kotaku.com/disney-streaming-inside-out-price-hike-increase-when-1851614922">just a year after the last hike</a>. This reveal of the new streaming tax also comes just a day after the company announced Jimmy Kimmel <a href="https://kotaku.com/disney-announces-jimmy-kimmel-return-tuesday-boycott-back-abc-not-canceled-2000627662">would be back on the air, sorta</a>, following calls for a boycott of all Disney products after his late-night show was indefinitely pulled.</p> <p>According <a href="https://www.vulture.com/article/disney-plus-hulu-espn-streaming-price-hikes-kimmel-2025.html">t</a><a href="https://www.vulture.com/article/disney-plus-hulu-espn-streaming-price-hikes-kimmel-2025.html">o <em>Vulture</em></a>, the new prices start a month from today on October 23. At that point, four of Disney’s subscription tiers will go up in price with the largest increase a whopping 20 percent. Here are the new prices:</p> <ul> <li data-editable="text" data-uri="www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmfwpfb0i00333b78zwbaf199@published" data-word-count="32">Disney+ and Hulu Bundle (with ads) – $13 a month (was $11)</li> <li data-editable="text" data-uri="www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmfwpfb0i00333b78zwbaf199@published" data-word-count="32">Disney+ Premium (no ads) –&nbsp;$19 a month (was $16)</li> <li data-editable="text" data-uri="www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmfwpfb0i00333b78zwbaf199@published" data-word-count="32">Disney+ (with ads)&nbsp;– $12 a month (was $10)</li> <li data-editable="text" data-uri="www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmfwpflqj00383b78uboz5qhu@published" data-word-count="33">Hulu + Live TV (with ads) –&nbsp;$90 a month (was $87)</li> </ul> <p data-editable="text" data-uri="www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmfwpflqj00383b78uboz5qhu@published" data-word-count="33">Not all of the prices are going up. The Disney+ and Hulu Premium Bundle without ads will still be $20 a month and Hulu Premium without adds will still be $19. Still, I mean, $90 a month for live TV? In this economy? Why did any of us bother cutting the cord in the first place?</p>

 <p>All entertainment is getting more expensive right now. The streaming wars might as well be called the pricing wars now, except that everyone’s racing to bump prices up instead of undercut one another. Disney’s price hikes come at a weird time, and not only because it just tossed the First Amendment in the trash to appease a sunsetting authoritarian president. There’s also just not a whole lot going on with the service right now outside of the ESPN bundle with fall sports. The next phase of the MCU is delayed, <em>Star Wars</em> is on a post-<em>Andor</em> hiatus until <a href="https://kotaku.com/star-wars-mandalorian-grogu-trailer-reactions-2000627675"><em>The Mandalorian and Grogu</em></a>, and even season four of <em>Bluey</em> is nowhere in sight. A feature-length movie adaptation of the hit Australian dog cartoon isn’t due until 2027.</p> <p>Simply put, if you only watch your local football team, whose games are free to watch on broadcast television, there’s simply never been a better time to ditch Disney+. Unless you are my son, who’s excited for Halloween and keeps hounding me to watch <em>The Nightmare Before Christmas</em>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Later this year,<a href="https://kotaku.com/avatar-3-fire-and-ash-trailer-fire-clan-james-cameron-1851787146"> <em>Avatar: Fire and Ash</em>,</a> the third entry in James Cameron’s blockbuster sci-fi saga, will arrive in theaters. And as that movie hits cinemas, a big new expansion related to the sci-fi sequel will launch for Ubisoft’s <a href="https://kotaku.com/video/avatar-frontiers-of-pandora-open-world-ubisoft-far-cry-1851209744">overlooked<em> Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora.</em></a><em>&nbsp;</em></p> <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/avatar-frontiers-of-pandora-impressions-review-ubisoft-1851077773">2023’s<em> Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora</em></a> is a solid open-world game that plays a lot like <em>Far Cry</em> and features a gorgeous alien jungle to explore as a giant blue cat person, aka a Navi warrior. While the game didn’t set the world on fire at launch, it has developed a loyal following of players and received some post-launch DLC and updates. And now Ubisoft has announced a whole new expansion for the under-the-radar game that will connect it directly to the next <em>Avatar</em> film.</p> <p>The upcoming DLC, <em>From the Ashes,</em> is set to launch on December 19 for consoles and PC alongside the new movie, which arrives on the same day in theaters. It will cost $20 for people who own the main game already, and Ubisoft plans to sell a $40 version that bundles the game and the expansion together for new players.</p>

 <p>Here’s the official trailer for the new expansion, as well as Ubisoft’s plot summary:</p> <blockquote><p>“<em>From the Ashes</em> sees players embark on the journey of So’lek, a battle-hardened Na’vi warrior from the Trr’ong clan. Ambushed and left for dead by the RDA and their new allies—the ruthless Ash clan—So’lek awakens to a world in flames and his Sarentu family scattered. Driven by grief and vengeance, he sets out to reunite with and protect his loved ones.”</p></blockquote>  <p>“<em>From the Ashes</em> takes place a few weeks after the events of the upcoming film<em> Fire and Ash</em> and roughly six months after <em>Frontiers of Pandora</em> and both story packs,” the DLC’s creative director Omar Bouali <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/avatar-frontiers-of-pandora-from-the-ashes-dlc-announced-release-timed-with-fire-and-ash-movie">explained to <em>IGN</em></a>. “<em>From the Ashes</em> is set in a ravaged and occupied version of the Kinglor Forest, which includes a new sub-region, The Ravines. It mirrors the themes of the film as it sees the RDA ally with the Ash Clan, fierce Na’vi warriors who thrive on chaos and pain as they intensify their efforts to eliminate threats to their regime. So, whilst the film and expansion are set in different regions of Pandora, there is some shared DNA and we’ve worked closely with Lightstorm to ensure both pieces of <em>Avatar</em> media are complementary.”</p> <p>Shortly before the launch of the third movie and this new DLC, <em>Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora</em> will receive a big, free update. <a href="https://kotaku.com/avatar-frontiers-pandora-cheap-third-person-new-game-1851786644">As previously announced</a>, this new update will arrive on December 5 and add new game+ and a third-person camera option. Then two weeks later, this new DLC arrives. For fans of <em>Frontiers of Pandora</em>, all 46 of you out there (myself included), this is some good news and a great way to end the year. Let’s just hope the DLC and new movie are good.</p>
