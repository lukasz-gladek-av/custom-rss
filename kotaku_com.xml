              <p>Just a few weeks after launch and less than three months after it was first announced at the Game Awards, <em>Highguard&nbsp;</em>is…still alive. But its official website is suddenly down, sparking online rumors that the game is not long for this world.</p> <p><a href="https://x.com/Mr_Rebs_/status/2023787343409205651?s=20">As spotted by Rebs Gaming</a> and others, earlier today, <a href="https://playhighguard.com/">the official PlayHighguard.com website</a> was replaced with a simple static page, featuring the game’s logo and a message that says: “This site is currently unavailable.” Below that is a support email to ping about the down site. <em>Kotaku</em> has contacted Wildlight Entertainment for more information.<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/HighGuardgame/comments/1r754vn/the_website_is_down/"> It seems the site has been down since at least 7:50 am EST</a>.</p>

 <figure id="attachment_2000669742" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000669742"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000669742"><em>A screenshot of the Highguard website showing a message that it is unavailable.</em> © Wildlight / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/game-awards-trailers-recap-highguard-titanfall-apex-2000653088">The raid shooter’s big reveal as the last teaser of the night at the 2025 Game Awards</a> in December didn’t go over as planned, with people turning on the game in seconds, declaring it generic and criticizing whether the world needed another free-to-play online-only shooter. A period of radio silence followed, leading to content creators filling the void with endless amounts of negative videos and online speculation running wild.</p> <p>When <a href="https://kotaku.com/highguard-the-kotaku-review-is-it-good-free-ps5-pc-5v5-3v3-update-patch-2000664646"><em>Highguard</em></a> finally did launch in January, it kicked off with over 90k concurrent players on Steam before <a href="https://kotaku.com/highguard-layoffs-dead-game-awards-live-service-2000668192">losing nearly all of them within 48 hours</a>. Later updates and <a href="https://kotaku.com/highguard-big-update-free-shooter-future-patch-notes-wildlight-2000664584">a 5v5 mode</a> didn’t bring people back. <a href="https://kotaku.com/highguard-studio-developer-layoffs-wildlight-entertainment-2000667841">Layoffs hit Wildlight Entertainment shortly after</a>. And now that the website for the game is down, people are wondering if this is it.</p> <p><em>Developing story…</em></p>

            <title><![CDATA[This Is The Ultimate Trick Shot Of Pokémon Shiny Hunting]]></title>
            <link>https://kotaku.com/pokemon-shiny-hunting-odds-red-blue-moltres-crystal-2000669729</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><span>I’ve watched a lot of </span><i><span>Pok</span></i><i><span>é</span></i><i><span>mon </span></i><span>fans </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-shiny-odds-scarlet-violet-ivs-red-gyarados-1850248457"><span>shiny hunt</span></a><span> over the years, but somehow I’ve never actually witnessed what gaming YouTuber RaidAway just pulled off. Shiny Pokémon, the rare, alternate-colored version of the series’ monsters, were introduced in </span><i><span>Gold </span></i><span>and </span><i><span>Silver</span></i><span>, but because of how these rarities spawn in the early games, it’s possible that a Pok</span><span>é</span><span>mon who originates from the first generation games can turn out to be Shiny when they’re traded over. RaidAway encountered an example of exactly that, and he did it with not just any monster, but a Legendary one from </span><i><span>Pok</span></i><i><span>é</span></i><i><span>mon Blue</span></i><span>.</span></p> <p><span>Moltres, like the rest of the Legendary Birds in </span><i><span>Pokémon Red</span></i><span> and </span><i><span>Blue</span></i><span>, only spawns once per save file. You’ll find this flame-covered fowl late in the game at Victory Road, and if you fail to capture it the first time you approach it, you won’t get a second chance in that playthrough. Shiny hunting Legendary Pokémon is notoriously a hassle, as you have to reset your game multiple times, retriggering the same battle over and over, to see if you can find a rarer version of the most sought-after monsters in the game. RaidAway didn’t have to do that with Moltres on </span><i><span>Pokémon Blue</span></i><span>, and wouldn’t have been able to, as there was no indication that the bird was Shiny in the old game. However, when he traded it over to </span><i><span>Pokémon Crystal</span></i><span>, he saw the Moltres for what it truly was.</span></p>

 <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">I ACCIDENTALLY FOUND A SHINY MOLTRES IN POKEMON BLUE TRANSFERING TO CRYSTAL</p> <p>THIS IS THE MOST INSANE SHINY EVER.. <a href="https://t.co/cSqFR4wRN5">pic.twitter.com/cSqFR4wRN5</a></p> <p>— Rich (@RaidAway) <a href="https://twitter.com/RaidAway/status/2023570861320548712?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">February 17, 2026</a></p></blockquote>  <p><span>How is this possible? Back in Generation II, Shiny status was determined by a Pokémon’s Individual Values, which are essentially the monster’s genetic disposition toward certain stats. So if your IVs for Attack, Speed, Defense, etc. landed on a specific number combination in the back end, they’d show up in a new color. These points still existed in the first-gen games, but it wasn’t until the sequels that they gained this additional trait. So that’s why a monster traded up can still end up being Shiny, even if you can’t clock that when you catch them in </span><i><span>Red </span></i><span>and </span><i><span>Blue</span></i><span>.</span></p> <p><span>Shiny Moltres trades the yellow body of the original for a pink one, which means not only that this statistical anomaly is an impressive stroke of dumb luck, but that RaidAway also wound up with a prettier version of the bird. He explains on X that he was working on a </span><i><span>Crystal</span></i> <a href="https://x.com/RaidAway/status/2023783654636556441?s=20"><span>Living Dex</span></a><span>, which is a term for when a player has captured one of every Pokémon in one game. Typically, Shiny hunting is </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-battle-revolution-shiny-hunting-costumes-kyogre-2000667344"><span>an arduous task</span></a><span> that can take hours of banging your head against a wall until one shows up. But sometimes you get lucky and find one by accident. It’s just not often that it’s a Pokémon as rare as Moltres.&nbsp;</span></p>

            <title><![CDATA[Kingdom Come Deliverance II And The Witcher 3 Are Coming To Xbox Game Pass]]></title>
            <link>https://kotaku.com/kingdom-come-deliverance-witcher-3-xbox-game-pass-2000669707</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Two of the biggest, most popular and most utterly enormous RPGs of the recent era are coming to Xbox Game Pass in the next few weeks. First, on February 19, the Complete Edition of <em>The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt</em> arrives on Microsoft’s gaming subscription platform, followed by&nbsp;<em>Kingdom Come: Deliverance II</em> on March 3. And that’s alongside a bunch of other games of note.</p> <p>February has already seen the arrival of a preview build of RTS <em>Menace&nbsp;</em>and the arrival of&nbsp;<em>Diablo II: Resurrected&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>High on Life 2</em> to Game Pass, which is hard to sniff at (until you remember that <a href="https://kotaku.com/xbox-game-pass-ultimate-price-hike-cod-2000632122">Microsoft increased the price</a> of the subscription from $20 to $30 a month last year). But the second half of the month is much more busy, starting today with the addition of&nbsp;<em>Aerial_Knight’s DropShot</em>, and Ubisoft’s <a href="https://kotaku.com/ubisofts-avatar-game-is-so-much-better-than-fire-and-ash-2000659445">surprisingly great</a>&nbsp;<em>Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora</em>. Additionally, Obsidian’s <a href="https://kotaku.com/avowed-xbox-pc-rpg-game-pass-skyrim-review-kotaku-1851761525">wonderful RPG</a>&nbsp;<em>Avowed</em> is brought down from Ultimate to Premium, to let more people in.</p>

 <p>Coming up in a couple of days is&nbsp;<em>Death Howl</em>, a deckbuilder that was already on PC Game Pass and is now spreading its spiritual wings to console, joined by last July’s <em>EA Sports College Football 26.</em> And then there’s the rather large matter of <em>The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt</em>‘s return to Game Pass after leaving way back in 2021. This time the CD Projekt RPG is in its updated Complete Edition form. (It’s worth noting you <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/sub/124923/">can grab the same from Steam</a> for just $10 right now.)</p> <p>Another game preview arrives Feb 24 with&nbsp;<em>TCG Card Shop Simulator</em>, which hopefully won’t include regular break-ins from which to recover. The next day, PC Game Pass gets dice-rolling roguelike <em>Dice a Million</em>, and the day after that, on Feb. 26, action-RPG <em>Towerborne</em> comes out of early access as a fully finished release.</p>

 <p>Jump to March 3 (presumably February is just too short of a month to cram it all in) and two more big names get squished in. First is <em>Final Fantasy III</em>, and then the headliner, <em>Kingdom Come: Deliverance II</em>. Last year’s action-RPG from Warhorse was a smash hit, and despite the company’s CEO and director Daniel Vavra having been <a href="https://kotaku.com/my-e3-meeting-with-a-pro-gamergate-developer-1715511964">a consistently destructive</a> <a href="https://kotaku.com/we-keep-having-the-same-video-game-arguments-and-its-dr-1841027051">voice</a> in the industry, the game somehow managed to piss off all the worst people for its more progressive values. Hooray!</p>

 <p>Anyway, if&nbsp;<em>Witcher 3</em> and&nbsp;<em>KCDII</em> aren’t enough to keep you busy on top of <em>High on Life 2</em> and&nbsp;<em>Avatar</em>, I dunno how to help you.</p>
