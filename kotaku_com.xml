              <p data-start="157" data-end="888">Black Friday and Cyber Monday may have come and gone, but that doesn’t mean all the best discounts have disappeared with them. In fact, one of the strongest lingering deals right now is on the Apple AirPods 4. Even though these earbuds are just over a year old, they’re getting a surprisingly steep price cut—making this an ideal moment to grab a pair if you’ve been waiting for a sale. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6034/">The ANC-enabled AirPods 4 launched at $179, but Amazon currently has them marked down 45%, bringing the price to just $99</a>. That’s a staggering $80 off the original cost. If you prefer add on AppleCare+, the version packed with Apple’s coverage is also discounted down to just $118 (down from $208).</p>
<p data-start="890" data-end="1292">AirPods have been a staple in Apple’s lineup for years, and each generation sees subtle but meaningful refinements. The newest AirPods 4 introduce a sleeker shape with a shorter stem and intuitive quick-press controls for managing your audio. Apple has put an emphasis on all-day comfort in this redesign, aiming to make them easier to wear for longer stretches—whether you’re commuting, working, or relaxing.</p>

<h2 data-start="1294" data-end="1311">Isolate Sound</h2>
<p data-start="1313" data-end="1686">One of the biggest upgrades comes from Apple’s H2 chip, which significantly improves call quality. The chip enables advanced voice isolation that filters out background noise, ensuring the person on the other end hears you clearly, even in loud or crowded environments. Instead of competing with chatter, engine noise, or street sounds, your voice remains front and center.</p>
<p data-start="1688" data-end="1970">That same H2 chip enhances your listening experience as well. Apple’s updated acoustic architecture is designed to deliver richer audio, offering detailed highs and deeper bass for music, podcasts, and videos. The improvements make everyday listening feel more dynamic and polished.</p>
<p data-start="1688" data-end="1970">With active noise cancellation, you can reduce unwanted background noise so you can focus solely on your entertainment or phone call. The H2 chip allows the AirPods 4 to blend together ANC and Transparency Mode. If you start speaking with someone nearby, the AirPods 4 can automatically adjust the volume of what’s playing so you can hold a conversation.</p>


<p data-start="1972" data-end="2365">Another enhancement is the new interaction capabilities with Siri—Apple’s voice assistant. The AirPods 4 can interpret simple head gestures like nodding yes or shaking your head noas responses to Siri’s questions. It’s a futuristic touch, though I’m not sure which is weirder. Someone sitting across from you seeing you blankly nodding and shaking your head, or deadpan whispering “yes” or “no” to seemingly nobody.</p>
<p data-start="2367" data-end="2703">One immediately noticeable change from the previous generation is the charging port. Apple has finally moved away from the proprietary Lightning connector. The AirPods 4 charging case now uses USB-C, aligning with the broader industry standard and making charging more convenient if you already have USB-C cables for your other devices.</p>
<p data-start="2705" data-end="2995" data-is-last-node="" data-is-only-node=""><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6034/">With Black Friday and Cyber Monday now behind us, it is a pleasant surprise to see a deal this strong still available—especially on a newer Apple product.</a> If you’ve been thinking about upgrading your earbuds, the ongoing discount on the AirPods 4 is worth taking advantage of while it lasts.</p>
