              <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/phil-spencer-xbox-leaving-retirement-microsoft-2000672059">Xbox boss Phil Spencer is retiring after 12 years</a> leading Microsoft’s gaming division. His replacement is Asha Sharma, the president of Microsoft’s CoreAI Product division. And in the new Xbox head’s first memo, she promises to avoid AI slop, but makes it clear that AI will be a part of the brand’s future.</p> <p>On February 20, <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/phil-spencer-retiring-sarah-bond-out-matt-booty-promoted-as-microsoft-ai-exec-asha-sharma-named-new-xbox-boss-exclusive?utm_source=bluesky,threads,twitter">Spencer confirmed in an interview with <em>IGN</em></a> that he is stepping down from his role as CEO of Microsoft Gaming after over a decade leading Xbox. While many assumed his replacement would be Sarah Bond, the president of Xbox, that wasn’t the case. Bond is also leaving Xbox alongside Spencer. Instead, <a href="https://ignite.microsoft.com/en-US/speakers/5e943e22-f2b6-4443-b8b0-55749176a169">Sharma</a> has been chosen to lead the Xbox division, and in her first memo to the company, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/games/882326/read-microsoft-gaming-ceo-asha-sharma-first-memo">obtained by </a><em><a href="https://www.theverge.com/games/882326/read-microsoft-gaming-ceo-asha-sharma-first-memo">The Verge</a>,</em> the former head of AI at Microsoft promised “the return of Xbox” and claimed she would avoid flooding Xbox with AI slop, but that it would “evolve” and be a part of Xbox’s “future”</p>

 <p>“As monetization and AI evolve and influence this future, we will not chase short-term efficiency or flood our ecosystem with soulless AI slop,” said Sharma. “Games are and always will be art, crafted by humans, and created with the most innovative technology provided by us.”</p> <p>The new Xbox boss also promised that more great games were coming.</p> <p>“We must have great games beloved by players before we do anything,” said Sharma. “Unforgettable characters, stories that make us feel, innovative gameplay, and creative excellence. We will empower our studios, invest in iconic franchises, and back bold new ideas. We will take risks. We will enter new categories and markets where we can add real value, grounded in what players care about most.”</p>

 <p>As for future consoles, something Xbox has previously confirmed and teased, Sharma says the company will “celebrate” its fans and history with a “renewed commitment to Xbox starting with console.” Though the new boss made it clear that Xbox isn’t going back to being simply a console and the brand will continue to expand to more platforms, like mobile and streaming.</p> <p>“Gaming now lives across devices, not within the limits of any single piece of hardware,” said Sharma. “As we expand across PC, mobile, and cloud, Xbox should feel seamless, instant, and worthy of the communities we serve. We will break down barriers so developers can build once and reach players everywhere without compromise.”</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><span>After more than a decade in charge of Xbox, Phil Spencer is retiring from his position at the top of Microsoft’s Gaming Division, as laid out in a story from <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/phil-spencer-retiring-sarah-bond-out-matt-booty-promoted-as-microsoft-ai-exec-asha-sharma-named-new-xbox-boss-exclusive?utm_source=bluesky,threads,twitter"><em>IGN</em></a>. Sarah Bond, the president of Xbox, is also leaving the company. </span></p> <p>Asha Sharma previously president of Microsoft’s CoreAI product, has been promoted to CEO of Microsoft Gaming. Xbox Game Studios head Matt Booty is being promoted to chief content officer. Spencer will remain at Xbox through the summer in an advisory role.</p> <p data-cy="paragraph">“Last fall, I shared with Satya [Nadella, Microsoft CEO] that I was thinking about stepping back and starting the next chapter of my life,” Spencer said in an email to employees. “From that moment, we aligned on approaching this transition with intention, ensuring stability, and strengthening the foundation we’ve built. Xbox has always been more than a business. It’s a vibrant community of players, creators, and teams who care deeply about what we build and how we build it. And it deserves a thoughtful, deliberate plan for the road ahead.</p> <p data-cy="paragraph">“Today marks an exciting new chapter for Microsoft Gaming as Asha Sharma steps into the role of CEO, and I want to be the first to welcome her to this incredible team. Working with her over the past several months has given me tremendous confidence. She brings genuine curiosity, clarity and a deep commitment to understanding players, creators, and the decisions that shape our future. We know this is an important moment for our fans, partners, and team, and we’re committed to getting it right. I’ll remain in an advisory role through the summer to support a smooth handoff.”</p> <p data-cy="paragraph">Sharma laid out her hopes for the future of Xbox in her own email, in which she said she wants to spearhead the “return of Xbox,” and also said that she wants to commit to human-made work and reject “soulless AI slop.” The email read as follows:</p>

 <blockquote> <p data-cy="paragraph">My first job is simple: understand what makes this work and protect it. That starts with three commitments. First, great games. Everything begins here. We must have great games beloved by players before we do anything. Unforgettable characters, stories that make us feel, innovative game play, and creative excellence. We will empower our studios, invest in iconic franchises, and back bold new ideas. We will take risks. We will enter new categories and markets where we can add real value, grounded in what players care about most. I promoted Matt Booty in honor of this commitment. He understands the craft and the challenges of building great games, has led teams that deliver award-winning work, and has earned the trust of game developers across the industry.</p> <p data-cy="paragraph">Second, the return of Xbox. We will recommit to our core Xbox fans and players, those who have invested with us for the past 25 years, and to the developers who build the expansive universes and experiences that are embraced by players across the world. We will celebrate our roots with a renewed commitment to Xbox starting with console which has shaped who we are. It connects us to the players and fans who invest in Xbox, and to the developers who build ambitious experiences for it.</p> <p data-cy="paragraph">Third, future of play. We are witnessing the reinvention of play. To meet the moment, we will invent new business models and new ways to play by leaning into what we already have: iconic teams, characters, and worlds that people love. But we will not treat those worlds as static IP to milk and monetize. We will build a shared platform and tools that empower developers and players to create and share their own stories.</p> <p data-cy="paragraph">As monetization and AI evolve and influence this future, we will not chase short-term efficiency or flood our ecosystem with soulless AI slop. Games are and always will be art, crafted by humans, and created with the most innovative technology provided by us.</p> </blockquote> <p data-cy="paragraph">Booty said in his own email to staff that he was “excited” to work with Sharma and was encouraged by his early conversations with the incoming CEO.</p> <p data-cy="paragraph">“Our first conversations centered on her commitment to making great games and the role that plays in our overall success,” Booty wrote. “She asks questions, pushes for clarity, and wants our choices grounded in player and developer needs. That mindset matters as the industry around us is changing quickly: how players engage, how games are made, and how business models and platforms evolve.</p> <p data-cy="paragraph">“We have good reasons to believe in what’s ahead. This organization and its franchises have navigated change for decades, and our strength comes from teams who know how to adapt and keep delivering. That confidence is grounded in a strong pipeline of established franchises, new bets we believe in, and clear player demand for what we are building.”</p> <p><span>Spencer has been with Microsoft since 1988 and has been with the Xbox brand since 2001, helping to launch the original console against the PS2 and GameCube 25 years ago. He was promoted to the head of Xbox in 2014 shortly after the launch of the Xbox One, and has remained a face of the brand for 12 years, operating as the CEO of Microsoft Gaming since 2022.</span></p>

 <p><span>The departure comes after a long struggle to put Xbox back on top of the console gaming ecosystem. Alongside milestones like Game Pass and acquiring Activision Blizzard there have also been plenty of game delays, cancelations, layoffs, and studio closures. </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/xbox-earnings-q2-game-pass-hardware-next-gen-pc-2000663911"><span>Soft sales of the Xbox Series X/S</span></a><span> compared to the PlayStation 5 and Switch in the most recent generation pushed Microsoft to take many once-exclusive games multiplatform, doing what was once unthinkable and bringing <em>Halo</em> to Sony’s rival gaming platform.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><span>The Xbox division has reportedly been under significant pressure from Microsoft to </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/xbox-microsoft-price-hike-game-pass-layoffs-new-console-2000638546"><span>reach abnormally high profit margins</span></a><span>, which some speculate has played a part in the rise of prices for Xbox consoles and subscription services in recent years.</span></p>

              <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/bluepoint-sony-playstation-ps5-god-war-2000671390">PlayStation’s decision to shut down Bluepoint Games</a> went over very poorly with fans. Unfortunately, the bad vibes are coming right as Bungie is getting ready to launch<em> Marathon</em>. Frustrated comments are now clogging up the PlayStation social feeds as some PS5 players threaten to boycott the extraction shooter and any future live-service games from Sony.</p> <p>On February 19, Sony confirmed it was shutting down Bluepoint Games, a studio that has become well respected for its high-quality remakes and remasters of older games. The studio was caught up in<a href="https://kotaku.com/sonys-ps5-era-studio-acquisition-spree-has-been-a-disaster-2000671404"> Sony’s live-service shuffle</a> after the <em>God of War</em> online spin-off it was reportedly working on was shelved, and none of its other pitches were approved. The news upset a lot of people, including developers and fans. And now, <em>Marathon</em>, a live-service shooter from Bungie and Sony, is set to release in two weeks and has become a target for frustrated players tired of Sony’s online game push.</p>

 <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">Two weeks to go.</p> <p>Marathon, Bungie's futuristic PvPvE extraction FPS,&nbsp;launches March 5. Try the Server Slam at no cost February 26 to March 2: <a href="https://t.co/4VAZFXbut8">https://t.co/4VAZFXbut8</a> <a href="https://t.co/slN6eLb3jS">pic.twitter.com/slN6eLb3jS</a></p> <p>— PlayStation (@PlayStation) <a href="https://twitter.com/PlayStation/status/2024563449641259466?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">February 19, 2026</a></p></blockquote>  <p>On Thursday, t<a href="https://x.com/PlayStation/status/2024563449641259466">he official PlayStation account on Twitter posted</a> a boring marketing tweet hyping up players by reminding them that <em>Marathon</em> was just two weeks away and a free beta was launching even sooner. But if you check the replies, people aren’t hyped. They are the opposite of hyped. Mad players still reeling from the Bluepoint news are claiming that they will boycott <em>Marathon</em> entirely, while others are simply hoping it will flop or <a href="https://kotaku.com/concord-shutting-down-closing-servers-refunds-ps5-1851638566">calling it the next <em>Concord</em>.</a></p> <blockquote><p>“Refunded! Im not going to support any GaaS from PlayStation after closing down BluePoint Games,” said one user with a screenshot claiming to show the return.</p> <p>“This game will be a major flop for you guys! Watch us not buy this trash and destroy it with reviews. I will never forget what you did to Bluepoint,” posted another fan.</p> <p>“I’m thinking not to support this game, after today’s disappointing announcement,” said someone else on Twitter.</p> <p>“I’m definitely not playing this out of spite. Bluepoint doesn’t deserve to get shut down. If it weren’t for <em>Demon’s Souls,</em> I wouldn’t have bought a PS5 at launch,” claimed one player.</p> <p>“I hope everyone boycotts <em>Marathon</em> for you closing Bluepoint,” shared a different user.</p></blockquote> <p>And it goes on. As of 1:30 p.m. EST on February 20, the tweet has over 1,900 replies, and many of them are from fans angry with Sony and the Bluepoint news. Over on YouTube, the comments aren’t nearly as aggressively anti-<em>Marathon</em>, but you can find plenty of newer replies claiming they will boycott the game or wishing for <em>Marathon</em> to flop. It also seems like PlayStation has stopped posting on social media due to the backlash, <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/news/2026/02/sony-goes-silent-on-social-media-as-fans-turn-feral-following-bluepoint-closure">as pointed out by <em>Push Square.&nbsp;</em></a></p>

 <p>Will any of this actually hurt <em>Marathon</em>? Probably not. Angry gamers claiming they intend to boycott a popular game and then playing it anyway is a common trend, as seen in this classic image of <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/pics/comments/a40ji/modern_warfare_2_boycott_fail/">C<em>all of Duty</em> players in a boycott <em>MW2</em> group playing the game on launch day</a>.</p>

 <p>So yeah, I find it hard to believe that most offline gamers who aren’t scanning sites like <em>Kotaku</em> and Reddit daily for news and leaks even know Bluepoint is closing up or could even name the studio if asked. Still, games like <em>Marathon</em> need a dedicated playerbase that will stick around through all the updates, and often those players are the terminally online sickos out there following game accounts on Twitter and keeping up with the news. It seems that for many of these gamers, <em>Marathon</em> is exactly what they don’t want more of, and Bluepoint’s death has only galvanized them against Sony’s live-service push.</p>
