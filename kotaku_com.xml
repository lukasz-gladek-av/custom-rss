Titled “Stamp,” the project aimed to be a 2D action platformer for the PlayStation Portable where PlayStation button symbols (square, triangle, circle, X) were used to navigate obstacles and create new structures in the environment. </p><p> Triangle would hurt enemies, circle would create bouncy objects, square would create platforms, and X would act as the delete button for objects. The story, meanwhile, revolved around a hero called Stampie rescuing his bug friends and family from the nasty oil bugs that had captured them. The game would also feature a multiplayer mode with co-op puzzles or battles where players tried to outlast one another. </p><p>“It’s like <em>LocoRoco</em> mixed with <em>Freakyforms</em> from 3DS,” <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/GamingLeaksAndRumours/comments/1j927bo/a_cancelled_psp_sony_japan_studio_games_prototype/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GamingLeaksAndRumours/comments/1j927bo/a_cancelled_psp_sony_japan_studio_games_prototype/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">remarked one fan on Reddit</a></span>. “I love it and want it.”<br></p><p>But the PSP game obviously never came out. It presumably never got past certain internal review gates needed to greenlight the entire product. While it’s impossible to tell why that was from the prototype materials, the pitch deck shows the types of concerns that go into making that type of decision, at least for a small, first-party portable game back in 2010.</p><p>A production schedule estimates the time and costs to complete the game and localize it (roughly 12 months and $3 million). A business case section projects break-even points for unit sales and the expected return on investment at various levels of marketing spend. It also points to other “Kawaii taste” games on the market and their respective sales numbers to give a ballpark, including <em>Pokémon Heart Gold </em>and <em>Soul Silver</em> at 2.8 million copies and<em> LittleBigPlanet</em> at 2.5 million copies. </p><p>Much of the pitch deck is just charts showing how many copies the game would need to sell at various price points and marketing budgets in order to break even or exceed certain levels of return on investment. Apparently, the people making the call didn’t think the math panned out. The game itself seemed like a neat idea, though maybe too small stakes for where Sony’s first-party ambitions were going. </p><p>Japan Studio was ultimately shut down in 2021 and its remaining teams spun off into other divisions, including Team Asobi which produced last year’s  imaginative hit <em>Astro Bot</em>. Still, Stamp is exactly the type of smaller whimsical experiment we don’t see as often from Sony these days, in part because it no longer has a gaming handheld to sell them on. Maybe that will change if the company ships the new <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/ps5-portable-sony-playstation-handheld-switch-2-1851707119&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/ps5-portable-sony-playstation-handheld-switch-2-1851707119">portable gaming device</a></span> it’s reportedly working on. </p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

The character Bailuan is looking to the left of the camera" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p><em>Dynasty Warriors: Origins </em>is, all told, a pretty straightforward game. Talk to some guys on the overworld map, get into a battle, fight all the soldiers and capture all the bases, rinse and repeat until the game is done. Even the postgame lays a clear path forward for those who want to see and do everything the game offers. With that said, you can imagine my surprise once I realized that, with over 100 hours put into the game, I found some pretty huge secrets that I <em>totally </em>missed as I played.</p><p>It’s a shame, as some of these hidden scenes and battles are pretty awesome! So whether you’re aiming for total completion yourself, or you just want to pick the game up again, here are five secrets that you don’t want to miss.</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="85431102d5f363e9dfa173dfbc30dc23" data-recommend-id="image://85431102d5f363e9dfa173dfbc30dc23" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="A screenshot from Dynasty Warriors: Origins.

However, even after her semi-romantic date with Ziluan and her dramatic capture by Dong Zhuo, she almost completely disappears from the main story after Chapter 3. What happened with her and Lu Bu? Where did she go?</p><p>Don’t worry, these questions have answers! <strong>To uncover Diaochan’s fate and unlock her final Bond event, you must attain complete peace in the Sili Province</strong>. You’ll naturally bolster the peace gauge if you aim to unlock every story path in the game, but you’ll almost certainly need to grind skirmishes to max out the peace in this region completely. Once you achieve total peace, a letter will appear in the inn as long as you’ve progressed far enough in the story. This will lead you to one final conversation with Diaochan, uniting her and Ziluan as they discuss what the future will look like for them.</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="d382e72894616303d601d87dfcb2189e" data-recommend-id="image://d382e72894616303d601d87dfcb2189e" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="A screenshot from Dynasty Warriors: Origins.

Fortunately, it seems Koei Tecmo and Omega Force agree, as <strong>you can unlock an entire string of Bond events with Zhang Jiao by replaying Chapter One in New Game Plus.</strong></p><p>Maxing out this Bond can be a bit tricky, as you need to complete several missions that you can’t skip by visiting Shui Jing Retreat. However, once you see the first two Bond event cutscenes, you can skip to Chapter 2 to unlock the final scene.</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="37be1337b9cc242d3f4b26a7e2940820" data-recommend-id="image://37be1337b9cc242d3f4b26a7e2940820" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="A screenshot from a cinematic in Dynasty Warriors: Origins.

You can save Dian Wei in Chapter 4, save Guo Jia in Chapter 5, and completely change the final Battle of Chibi by bringing Guo Jia with you and foiling Zhuge Liang’s surprise fire attack. With all these alternate outcomes, it’s <em>incredibly </em>easy to miss one <em>technically </em>unique cutscene that <em>only </em>triggers if you <em>don’t </em>save Dian Wei but <em>do </em>save Guo Jia. I <em>hope </em>my <em>use </em>of <em>italics </em>drives <em>home</em> how much <em>fun</em> I had <em>figuring </em>this <em>out</em>.</p><p>This scene genuinely adds functionally nothing to your experience, but it is a requirement if you want 100 percent story completion.
