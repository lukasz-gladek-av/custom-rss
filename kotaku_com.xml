            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><p>A new report claims that Activision’s upcoming <a href="https://kotaku.com/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-announced-trailer-xbox-ps5-1851784008"><em>Call of Duty: Black Ops 7</em></a> will merge the franchise’s famous multiplayer with the game’s single-player campaign by having the final mission take place in a 32-player online match.</p><p>In June, Xbox and Activision <a href="https://youtu.be/uUo5gnaYB_w">officially revealed <em>Call of Duty: Black Ops 7</em></a> as the next entry in the uber-popular shooter series. The game’s first teaser trailer offered up some glimpses of its future-based campaign as well as a brief look at multiplayer and Zombies, two <em>Call of Duty</em> staples at this point. We also know the game will feature a campaign that can be played solo or with up to three other players in co-op. That’s not a first for the series, but it isn’t common. What would be a first is that, reportedly, <em>Black Ops 7</em>‘s campaign will end in a climactic mission set inside a multiplayer match.</p><p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/black-ops-7-avalon-map-campaign/">On August 14, as reported by </a><em><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/black-ops-7-avalon-map-campaign/">Insider Gaming</a>,</em> sources told the outlet that <em>Black Ops 7</em>‘s campaign will feature 12 missions, and the final one will integrate the campaign into a 32-player multiplayer experience. The mission will take place in the map “Avalon,” which has been rumored for a bit now to be a battle royale location, but is actually the setting of this odd campaign experiment.</p><div data-player-id="plTxkEoh" data-name="Video_Collapse_Autoplay_SoundOff" id="cls-video-container-n9o50j6H"> <p><em>Insider Gamin</em>g says that the final mission sounds a lot like it will be an extraction-based experience with players needing to complete objectives before exiting the level and, presumably, finishing the game’s final campaign mission, though we’ll have to wait and see just what this all looks like in practice. While I’m always happy to see <em>Call of Duty</em> trying new things and shaking up the formula, I’m not a big fan of locking the game’s final mission behind an internet requirement. Will people be unable to play the last mission in 20-30 years when the servers are dead? Hopefully there’s a backup plan for offline folks.</p> <p>The merging of campaign and multiplayer like this is reportedly part of a larger push in <em>Black Ops 7</em> to merge the game’s various modes and offer players full progression across every part of the upcoming shooter, with the idea being that regardless of where you play, even in campaign, you can level up weapons, characters, and the battle pass. That’s a neat idea that seems inspired by <em>Fortnite’s</em> universal progression and XP system, <a href="https://www.fortnite.com/news/coming-soon-progress-your-fortnite-passes-by-playing-any-experience?lang=en-US">which Epic implemented last year</a>.</p> <p><em>Call of Duty: Black Ops 7</em> doesn’t have a release date yet, but Xbox and Activision will show off the game’s multiplayer later this month at Gamescom, and that seems like a fine time to announce a launch date. If the past is prologue, I’d expect you’ll be playing <em>Black Ops 7</em> in October or November.</p> </div></div><br/><br/>https://kotaku.com/call-of-duty-black-ops-7s-final-campaign-mission-will-reportedly-be-a-big-multiplayer-battle-2000617873]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              
              <p>It feels like a long time ago that Saber Interactive and Universal announced<em><a href="https://kotaku.com/games/jurassic-park-survival--2"> Jurassic Park: Survival</a>.</em> And that’s because yeah, it’s been nearly two years! Since then, we’ve not gotten much else about the game, but earlier today, we finally got some fresh looks at <em>Survival </em>in action.</p> <p><em>Jurassic Park: Survival</em> is an upcoming first-person action-horror game set one day after the events of the original<a href="https://kotaku.com/jurassic-park-jurassic-world-rebirth-movies-ranked-1851776876"><em> Jurassic Park</em> film</a>. You play as a new character, Dr. Maya Joshi, who is left on the island after everyone else escapes. Now she has to survive (oh, I get the name of the game now) while trying to figure out a way off dino island, aka Isla Nublar. <a href="https://kotaku.com/jurassic-park-survival-fps-action-trailer-game-awards-1851083053">The game was announced 19 months ago, all the way back in December 2023</a>, and since then, we’ve not seen much about it. That changed on Thursday with a new behind-the-scenes featurette from Universal and developers Saber Interactive.</p> <p><iframe loading="lazy" title="Jurassic Park: Survival | Behind-The-Scenes Featurette" width="500" height="281" src="about:blank" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen="" data-rocket-lazyload="fitvidscompatible" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/lLuxDHCY6kw?feature=oembed"></iframe></p> <p>On August 14, the official <em>Jurassic World/Jurassic Park</em> YouTube account posted <a href="https://youtu.be/lLuxDHCY6kw">a nearly six-minute-long video</a> featuring interviews with various developers and others working on <em>Survival.</em> And sprinkled throughout this video, which is mostly focused on all the movie-accurate details in <em>Survival</em>‘s environments,&nbsp;how it connects to the film, and the new main character–are some new looks at how the <a href="https://kotaku.com/dinosaur-games-dino-crisis-jurassic-park-horror-pc-ps5-1851771664">franchise’s iconic dinosaurs</a> will appear in the game.</p>

 <p>Look at that T. rex! I love it! And we get some more glimpses of how Velociraptors and the extremely tall Brachiosaurus look in<em> Jurassic Park: Survival,</em> too. As a massive <em>Jurassic Park</em> fan, all of this has me really excited to play the game. Sadly, we still don’t have a release date for <em>Survival</em>. And I’m not feeling good about it arriving this year. In a press release shared with <em>Kotaku</em> announcing this new video, Saber Interactive explained that “<em>J</em><i>urassic Park: Survival</i><i>&nbsp;</i>won’t be present at this year’s Gamescom.” Maybe it still shows up at Geoff Kielghley’s annual Opening Night Live ceremony later this month, but I’m not holding my breath about that.</p> <p>If you want to kill some time while waiting, you can always watch the original announcement trailer from 2023. It’s pretty cool.</p> <p><iframe loading="lazy" title="Jurassic Park: Survival | Announcement Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="about:blank" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen="" data-rocket-lazyload="fitvidscompatible" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/UinsNBOTNyU?feature=oembed"></iframe></p>

<p>Birdo is one of the primary unlockable characters in<i> Mario Kart World</i>. Being a relative mainstay in the <i>Super Mario</i> spinoffs since the Gamecube era, it’s a little surprising that she doesn’t show up in the game’s roster from the start. With icons like Donkey Kong and Daisy being unlocks too, though, I suppose it isn’t much of a surprise.</p> <p>On the bright side, uncovering her doesn’t take much effort: just four short races and she’ll be in your crew! Here’s what you need to know to get this unusual creature.</p> <h2><span id="the-best-karts-for-birdo"></span>The best karts for Birdo<span></span></h2> <p>As with many other characters, Reel Racer is hard to turn down as the best match for Birdo. That said, you may want to try your hand at the Biddybuggy given its improved acceleration and handling over the Reel Racer.</p> <h2><span id="how-to-unlock-birdo"></span>How to Unlock Birdo<span></span></h2> <figure id="attachment_2000617863" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000617863"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000617863">© © Screenshot: Nintendo</figcaption></figure> <p>If you want to unlock Birdo, you just need to complete the Banana Cup! Unfortunately, if you don’t want to unlock Birdo, she will still unlock after you complete the Banana Cup. Placement doesn’t matter. Whether you win every race or never get higher than 24th, Birdo will still join your crew when the Grand Prix is concluded.</p>

 <p>Birdo is a middleweight character, like her counterpart Yoshi. That means that she is a very well-rounded character, not excelling at anything in particular, but not lacking in anything either.</p> <h2><span id="all-outfits-for-birdo-in-mario-kart-world"></span>All Outfits for Birdo in <i>Mario Kart World</i><span></span></h2> <p>In total, Birdo has two outfits to select from at launch. If you’re mad at that fact, just know that you can’t be nearly as mad as I am that Donkey Kong got a quite short end of the stick with only one outfit. Anyways, here’s a list of foods to unlock those outfits:</p> <ul> <li aria-level="1">Pro racer: pancakes, donut, cake, burger, fruit salad, curry, ice cream</li> <li aria-level="1">Vacation: takoyaki, sushi, pizza, kebab, naan, fish and chips, popcorn</li> </ul> <p>Explore the open world in free roam, or travel the Mushroom Kingdom in modes like Knockout Tour to get access to a lot of different foods and increase your chances of finding what you need to unlock these costumes. Before long, you’ll find what you’re looking for and get these costumes for Birdo’s wardrobe!</p> <hr> <p><i>Mario Kart World </i>is available now on the Nintendo Switch 2.</p>

<p>One of the greatest racers in the Galaxy, Rosalina, has made her triumphant return to <i>Mario Kart </i>in <i>Mario Kart World</i>. However, she actually isn’t available to choose at the start. You’ll have to do a little bit of searching to find her.</p> <p>Luckily, it won’t take much. Here’s what you need to do to add Rosalina to your crew of playable drivers and which kart will see her speeding ahead of the rest.</p> <h2><span id="the-best-kart-for-rosalina"></span>The best kart for Rosalina<span></span></h2> <p>Luckily, your options for getting the most out of Rosalina are pretty simple: The Reel Racer offers excellent speed to keep you at the front of the pack. The Baby Blooper isn’t a bad second choice if the poorer handling of the Reel Racer doesn’t work for you.</p> <h2><span id="how-to-unlock-rosalina-in-mario-kart-world"></span>How to Unlock Rosalina in <em>Mario Kart World</em><span></span></h2> <figure id="attachment_2000617859" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000617859"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000617859">© Screenshot: Nintendo</figcaption></figure> <p>Rosalina is unlocked after you complete the Star Cup of the Grand Prix mode, a fitting place to find the de facto queen of the cosmos. It doesn’t matter how well you do in the races; whether you walk out with a gold trophy or participation ribbon, finishing the four tracks in the Star Cup is enough to add Rosalina to your playable roster of characters.</p>

 <p>Rosalina is a heavyweight character, meaning that she can knock other racers around easier and has a higher top speed. As a tradeoff, she has worse acceleration and handling.</p> <h2><span id="all-unlockable-rosalina-costumes"></span>All Unlockable Rosalina Costumes<span></span></h2> <p>Rosalina has four unlockable costumes to find: touring, aero, aurora, pro racer. Each of these costumes can be found by eating a few different foods. Here’s a list of some of those foods and the outfits that they can unlock:</p> <ul> <li aria-level="1">Touring: Burger, Fish and chips, pancakes, milk, chicken, kebab, pizza</li> <li aria-level="1">Aero: Donuts, curry</li> <li aria-level="1">Aurora: Ice cream, bread, popcorn</li> <li aria-level="1">Pro Racer: cake, fruit salad</li> </ul> <p>Explore the open world in free roam or during your races to find as many foods as possible to dig up each costume! Remember, once you find a costume, it will permanently be unlocked for you to choose on the character select screen to choose from the beginning of any race in the future.</p> <hr> <p><i>Mario Kart World </i>is available now on Nintendo Switch 2.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              
              <p>Over the last month, players from various countries have been reporting issues with trying to use PayPal on Steam. The popular online wallet for PC gaming’s most popular storefront seemed to go into permanent maintenance mode. Now, Valve has confirmed exactly what happened: <a href="https://kotaku.com/steam-itch-io-sex-game-nsfw-censor-visa-mastercard-1851787281">a recent censorship crackdown</a> led to the loss of global PayPal payment processing in all but six currencies.</p> <p>“In early July 2025, PayPal notified Valve that their acquiring bank for payment transactions in certain currencies was immediately terminating the processing of any transactions related to Steam,” reads a new section of Steam’s purchasing issues FAQ first reported <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/valve-explain-why-using-paypal-for-steam-purchases-isnt-currently-an-option-in-a-whole-bunch-of-countries">by <em>Rock, Paper, Shotgun</em></a>. “This affects Steam purchases using PayPal in currencies <i>other than</i> EUR, CAD, GBP, JPY, AUD and USD. We hope to offer PayPal as an option for these currencies in the future but the timeline is uncertain. We are also evaluating adding additional payment methods on Steam for the customers affected by this.”</p> <p>There was no immediate explanation for <em>why</em> PayPal’s payment processing had changed, even as PC players across major countries like Norway and Mexico found themselves unable to purchase games. “Just when <em>Satisfactory</em> is finally on sale,” one player <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Steam/comments/1m15oki/why/">complained</a> on Reddit on July 16.</p> <p>But Valve has now confirmed that the changes were directly related to the ongoing censorship campaign against adult content on Steam and other PC gaming storefronts. The loss of payment processing support by one of PayPal’s banking partners “is regarding content on Steam, related to&nbsp;what we’ve previously commented on surrounding Mastercard,” a spokesperson for the company <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/valve-explain-why-using-paypal-for-steam-purchases-isnt-currently-an-option-in-a-whole-bunch-of-countries">told <em>Rock, Paper, Shotgun</em></a>. “In this case, one of PayPal’s acquiring banks decided to stop processing any Steam transactions, which cut off PayPal on Steam for a number of currencies.”</p> <p>While that campaign, initiated by an Australian anti-porn group called Collective Shout, was in response to a small slice of games that included content related to sexual abuse and incest, it’s now led to some players in certain countries being unable to buy&nbsp;<em>anything</em> from Steam.</p> <p>“Been noticing this for quite a bit now, it started off as Paypal being ‘temporarily unavailable at this time’ here in the Philippines when I was trying to purchase games a few weeks ago,” wrote another Steam user <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Steam/comments/1mjto06/paypal_no_longer_available_in_the_philippines/">last week</a>. “Today, I wanted to pick up <em>Cyberpunk</em> on sale and then I get hit with [PayPal is currently unavailable in your country]. Seriously? Does anyone know when will this payment method be available again?”</p> <p>Steam’s FAQ suggest it’s hoping to get PayPal support for these countries back in the coming months, as well as exploring alternative payment systems. In the meantime, anti-censorship advocates are continuing to flood call centers <a href="https://aftermath.site/stripe-lgbtq-steam-itch-adult-games-delisted">of companies like Stripe</a> trying to reverse the pressure on storefronts like Steam and itch.io.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              
              <p>Folks have been modding lightsabers and <i>Star Wars</i> characters into Bethesda’s various open-world games for as long as modders have been poking around in the code of the developer’s Creation Engine. But it wasn’t until <i>Starfield</i> came along that we had a Bethesda game whose setting was naturally conducive to an ultimate <i>Star Wars</i> fantasy. <i>Starfield</i>’s 1000-plus star systems, its gorgeously rendered planets and customizable ships, have begged for modders to transform this vast digital space into a simulation of that beloved galaxy, far, far away. Since its launch in 2023, <i>Starfield</i> has received numerous mods, many of which are <i>Star Wars</i>-themed. But one project, <a href="https://genesismodlist.com/"><i>Star Wars Genesis</i></a>, aims to assemble the best that modders have put together.</p> <p><iframe loading="lazy" title="An Expanding Star Wars Galaxy — Cinematic Showcase and Release of Star Wars Genesis V8" width="500" height="281" src="about:blank" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen="" data-rocket-lazyload="fitvidscompatible" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/OC7wvzsH6Kw?feature=oembed"></iframe></p> <p>I recently went through the laborious install process (made even harder if you don’t own a Nexusmods Premium account) and had a chance to chat with the project lead, DeityVengy, about what inspired the project, what it’s been like putting it all together, and what the future holds for <i>Genesis.&nbsp;</i></p> <p>First, let’s back up a bit. <i>Star Wars Genesis</i> isn’t a mod itself, but rather a collection of mods all assembled with a handy installer known as wabbajack. The process of <a href="https://genesismodlist.com/install/">installing</a> will require a Jedi Master’s level of meditative patience. It’s extensive. Needing to click through so many mods, dealing with a few that failed on install the first time (wrestling with my damn storage drives that are always virtually at capacity didn’t help), and then finally running the game with this gargantuan list took me some time. So be prepared for a lengthy and fairly involved process–and know you still may run into some issues while installing or even when you try to run it.</p>

 <p>By some miracle of the Force, I, a woman who notoriously screws up mod installs, had <i>Star Wars Genesis</i> up and running on first boot and…<i>Wow</i>. Despite some framerate issues (I’m only running a 3070ti for a mod that recommends a darn 4090), it is impressive how readily <i>Starfield</i> can be transformed into a <i>Star Wars</i> sim. Some existing planets and cities are lightly transformed from their original state. Mars, for example, and its mining city from the base game serve as Geonosis now. Tatooine, which looks like it uses one of <i>Starfield</i>’s many desert worlds, is now home to a recreation of Mos Eisley–and walking around this dreaded hive of scum and villainy feels uncanny. But it’s not only textures, buildings, and new NPC models that fill the space. There’s a dedicated questline that does an impressive job of repurposing and tweaking the base game’s main quest, Constellation, with modified voicelines that swaps the UC Vanguard for the Empire and the Freestar Rangers for the Rebel Alliance.</p> <figure id="attachment_2000617838" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000617838"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000617838">© Screenshot: Bethesda / DeityVengy / Claire Jackson / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p><i>Genesis</i> takes place in an alternate take on what happens roughly 10 years following the events of <i>Revenge of the Sith</i>. It’s a fitting spot in the timeline for DeityVengy as <i>Episode III</i> is their favorite <i>Star Wars</i> film. “I kinda grew up in the prequel era,” they told me, “and naturally I ended up liking <i>Revenge of the Sith</i>.” They credit “shows like <i>Clone Wars</i>, <i>Kenobi</i>, and <i>Ashoka</i>” with having helped rehabilitate the once-maligned prequel era. Bear in mind, though, that <i>Genesis</i> isn’t set on delivering the most lore-accurate <i>Star Wars</i> experience.</p> <p>It’s still working within the bounds of what <i>Starfield</i> has to offer, plus, as explained in <a href="https://genesismodlist.com/lore/">the project’s lore page</a>, setting this mod project in an alternate universe means the player doesn’t just need to “fight the Empire, Crime Faction 1, and Crime Faction 2” as players do in so many <i>Star Wars</i> games that try to stick more closely to the lore. “Just look at <i>Force Unleashed</i>,” DeityVengy says. “Is it canon? No. Is it better than <i>Star Wars Outlaws</i> or the <i>Jedi Survivor</i> series story-wise? Hell yes.”</p>

 <p>Some may take issue with that last assessment of the recent <i>Star Wars</i> games, but it speaks to DeityVengy’s vision of this mod project firmly being “fanon, including what [they] consider the best aspects of every era.”</p> <p>Given the name of the project, I was curious about how this all started. Where does one get the impulse and the fortitude to assemble such an ambitious collection of mods, each from different modders, into one, fully working <i>Star Wars</i> sim? The project, DeityVengy told me, “started as a simple one-off video for my YouTube channel about one-and-a-half years ago. After the initial video blew up and more people got interested in it, I just had more motivation to keep it going and started working on my mods. It really [kicked off] after I made my main quest which completely rewrote <i>Starfield</i>’s main quest, and then there was another spike recently when I replaced New Atlantis with Coruscant.”</p>

It really just forced me to be concise and organized when I was learning how to mod. Without that initial challenge, the project would be a lot less organized and a lot buggier.”</p> <p>For those of us eager to wield a laser sword (yes, I called it that), there’s a bit of disappointment awaiting you at the end of the install process. “There are a few lightsaber mods out there,” they told me, “but I really refuse to add them unless their implementation is perfect, and that’s just unfortunately not possible without Bethesda releasing their animation framework tools.” Dodging and better third-person melee animations are really what DeityVegny seems to need to make the experience of wielding a lightsaber feel as good as it presently does to touch down in Mos Eisley and chill with some Jawas.</p>

The current mod list features a full rebranding of the game’s factions. House Va’ruun, for example, are now a roaming band of Sith zealots. “I’m taking a lot of inspiration from the success of <i>Andor</i> and am keeping it as a grounded story,” they said about the upcoming faction overhauls. “The Rebellion questline that I’m working on is going to be a much more <i>Andor</i>-esque story where you’re just a regular person solving a problem for the Rebel Alliance.”</p> <p><i>Star Wars Genesis </i>is currently on version 8.2.0, with the project having started in June of 2024 and receiving regular updates since then. The next version, 8.3, is just around the corner, promising over 1,000 new voicelines for the main quest. The install page recommends waiting for this new update if you’re new to the project. At the very least, it’s a good opportunity to do a fresh install of <i>Starfield</i> in anticipation as the process of getting everything up and running is made easier when you completely clear your computer of any trace of the old install.</p> <figure id="attachment_2000617840" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000617840"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000617840">© Screenshot: Bethesda / DeityVengy / Claire Jackson / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p>I’ve only spent a couple of hours poking around in DeityVegny’s take on the <i>Star Wars</i> universe, but from the opening moments on, with the iconic sights and sounds of <i>Star Wars</i> filling my eyes and ears, it’s clear I’ll be venturing to this version of one of the most beloved fictional galaxies of all time a hell of a lot more.</p> <hr> <div dir="auto" data-qa="virtual-list-item" role="listitem" aria-roledescription="message" data-qa-hover="true" data-qa-unprocessed="false" data-qa-placeholder="false" id="message-list_1755202910.217459" tabindex="0" aria-setsize="-1" data-item-key="1755202910.217459"> <p><b data-stringify-type="bold"><i data-stringify-type="italic">Updated, 8/14/2025, 4:15 p.m. ET</i></b><i data-stringify-type="italic">:</i>&nbsp;It has been brought to our attention that&nbsp;<i data-stringify-type="italic">Star Wars Genesis</i> currently makes use of ElevenLabs AI for much of its voice acting, a fact which was not mentioned in the original published version of this story.
