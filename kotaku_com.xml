The quest chain becomes available to you at the beginning of Act 3, and lets the Samurai frontman have the keys to V’s body to tie up some loose ends left by his untimely demise. If you’re playing a V that is wholly uninterested in Johnny’s wants and views his engram as nothing more than a digital parasite, it might not make sense to follow this path. But if you’re even the least bit curious about the impact Johnny’s left on those still alive in 2077, do these quests. They’ll show you new sides of Keanu Reeves’ character, and even unlock a new ending path.<br></p><p><strong>Available in:</strong> Act 3</p><p><strong>How to acquire:</strong> Given by Johnny at the start of Act 3</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="9df0e79f1b7a31d6e37d122d8043ce06" data-recommend-id="image://9df0e79f1b7a31d6e37d122d8043ce06" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Kerry and V are shown looking down at Night City from a balcony." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Kerry and V are shown looking down at Night City from a balcony." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->CD Projekt Red / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="9df0e79f1b7a31d6e37d122d8043ce06" data-recommend-id="image://9df0e79f1b7a31d6e37d122d8043ce06" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Kerry and V are shown looking down at Night City from a balcony." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>Some of <em>Cyberpunk 2077</em>’s best writing is in the companion quests, and Kerry Eurodyne, the rocker boy and ex-right hand of Johnny in the Samurai days, is a particular standout. Kerry’s quests take a fascinating look at how art persists in a capitalist hellscape like Night City, and explore how even if you preserve yourself with expensive cybernetics, age and time come for us all. It’s just a matter of how you adapt to its passage.</p><p>That’s what makes Kerry’s quests interesting regardless of the V you’re playing, but if you’re rolling a male V, you can also enter a relationship with Kerry, which is one of the most interesting explorations of V and Johnny’s cohabitation. He’s the last companion you meet in the game so his story comes pretty late, but it’s definitely worth seeking out before you head into the endgame.</p><p><strong>Available in:</strong> Act 3 after A Like Supreme</p><p><strong>How to acquire:</strong> Phone call from Kerry</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="17304c88a409d71d17e978f9aaab38ba" data-recommend-id="image://17304c88a409d71d17e978f9aaab38ba" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Judy is shown sitting on the hood of a car in diving gear." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Judy is shown sitting on the hood of a car in diving gear." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->CD Projekt Red / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="17304c88a409d71d17e978f9aaab38ba" data-recommend-id="image://17304c88a409d71d17e978f9aaab38ba" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Judy is shown sitting on the hood of a car in diving gear." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>Judy Alvarez is one of the few unambiguously good people in Night City, and her questline, in which she attempts to fight for better working conditions for sex workers in the city, is some of <em>Cyberpunk 2077</em>’s best introspective work.</p><p>The final quest, “Pyramid Song,” is one of the most memorable in <em>Cyberpunk 2077</em>, and shows Judy wrestling with what “home” means to her when Night City has only chewed her up and spit her out. It’s a lovely conclusion to a lovely character.</p><p><strong>Available in:</strong> Act 2 after Double Life</p><p><strong>How to acquire:</strong> Phone call from Judy</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="bc7addcc96edd3071bdb06de50888411" data-recommend-id="image://bc7addcc96edd3071bdb06de50888411" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="The nomads are shown gathered around a camp fire with Night City in the background." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="The nomads are shown gathered around a camp fire with Night City in the background." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->CD Projekt Red / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="bc7addcc96edd3071bdb06de50888411" data-recommend-id="image://bc7addcc96edd3071bdb06de50888411" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="The nomads are shown gathered around a camp fire with Night City in the background." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>Much like the Johnny questline, Panam’s personal quest opens up a new ending in <em>Cyberpunk 2077</em>. But that new path is only open to you because Panam and her Nomad family opens V up to a new way of thinking. Vibing with the Aldecaldos, who have no connection to the city and are mostly just passing through, offers a perspective you don’t hear very often in <em>Cyberpunk 2077</em>. So much of the time you spend in Night City is with people who put the city and its values up on a pedestal, whereas Panam and her family have the perspective to see through its bullshit.</p><p>Panam’s questline is all about helping her get the nomads into a better position to leave Night City, and maybe by the time you’re done, you’re at least considering other possibilities for yourself.</p><p><strong>Available in:</strong> Act 2 after Life During Wartime</p><p><strong>How to acquire:</strong> Phone call from Panam</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="309233db0c8fe5f9ec83638d58eae9c7" data-recommend-id="image://309233db0c8fe5f9ec83638d58eae9c7" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="V and River are shown looking at a computer in a bedroom." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="V and River are shown looking at a computer in a bedroom." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->CD Projekt Red / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="309233db0c8fe5f9ec83638d58eae9c7" data-recommend-id="image://309233db0c8fe5f9ec83638d58eae9c7" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="V and River are shown looking at a computer in a bedroom." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>Unlike Panam, Judy, and Kerry, River is the one companion you have to go out of your way to meet. Finding the Night City cop and helping him sort through a local mystery that weaves in and out of his family life makes for one of the most interesting breaks in <em>Cyberpunk 2077</em>’s usual action. Expect a little combat and chatter, but also light adventure game mechanics and some pretty horrifying Night City lore.</p><p>This questline does, however, unmask <em>Cyberpunk 2077</em>’s weird, inconsistent framing of cops and law enforcement, even weaponizing the ACAB saying in a particularly tacky lift that I’m not wild about. But if nothing else, these quests offer, for your inspection, a layer of the game’s inherent worldview that’s worth examining and dissecting.</p><p><strong>Available in:</strong> Act 2 after Life During Wartime</p><p><strong>How to acquire:</strong> Phone call from Elizabeth Peralez</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="900670a1c9768768ed74cb62383e0c4b" data-recommend-id="image://900670a1c9768768ed74cb62383e0c4b" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="V and Jackie are shown standing in an elevator." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="V and Jackie are shown standing in an elevator." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->CD Projekt Red / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="900670a1c9768768ed74cb62383e0c4b" data-recommend-id="image://900670a1c9768768ed74cb62383e0c4b" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="V and Jackie are shown standing in an elevator." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>The trouble with “Heroes” is the quest can take different forms depending on what decisions you make during “The Heist” in Act 1. Choose to send Jackie’s body to his family or tell Delamain to wait for you with his body and you’ll be rewarded with one of the best segments in <em>Cyberpunk 2077</em>. On the other hand, if you send him to Ripperdoc Viktor Vektor you’ll experience a much worse result that is pretty bleak.</p><p>The “good” version of “Heroes” is one of the game’s best examples of how human connection can help people weather the harsh realities of Night City. The quest reflects on Jackie’s life and legacy, and lets you insert a little of your own relationship with him, too.</p><p><strong>Available in:</strong> Act 2 after The Heist</p><p><strong>How to acquire:</strong> Phone call from Mama Welles</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="69d3d472a97106d78ae61d41e4121aff" data-recommend-id="image://69d3d472a97106d78ae61d41e4121aff" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Joshua and a corpo are shown sitting at a restaurant table while he eats." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Joshua and a corpo are shown sitting at a restaurant table while he eats." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->CD Projekt Red / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="69d3d472a97106d78ae61d41e4121aff" data-recommend-id="image://69d3d472a97106d78ae61d41e4121aff" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Joshua and a corpo are shown sitting at a restaurant table while he eats." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>The questline known colloquially as “Sinnerman” is harrowing, but offers one of the most rewarding hypotheticals V will face in <em>Cyberpunk 2077</em>. It follows convicted murderer Joshua Stephenson, who has a religious awakening in prison. Here, he decides he wants to face execution by crucifixion, which will be recorded in a Braindance for millions to experience every sensation and emotion.<br></p><p>Joshua asks V to accompany him in his final days, and the drama that unfolds asks the player to question the prisoner’s faith, whether you’re just being inquisitive or outright antagonistic. It also presents you with opportunities to meddle and interrogate whether that’s your place, making for a fascinating philosophical debate with Joshua, Johnny, and ultimately yourself.</p><p><strong>Available in:</strong> Act 2 after Life During Wartime</p><p><strong>How to acquire:</strong> Phone call from Wakako Okada</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="2d9def182ef496fb2d32063a92a1b430" data-recommend-id="image://2d9def182ef496fb2d32063a92a1b430" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="The Peralezes are seen sitting in their living room." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="The Peralezes are seen sitting in their living room." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->CD Projekt Red / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="2d9def182ef496fb2d32063a92a1b430" data-recommend-id="image://2d9def182ef496fb2d32063a92a1b430" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="The Peralezes are seen sitting in their living room." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>Much of <em>Cyberpunk 2077</em> is spent either on the ground floor of Night City or dealing with corporations and gangs, but “Dream On” offers one of the best looks into the universe’s political systems. The quest starts with some detective work for mayoral candidate Jefferson Peralez and his wife Elizabeth, and rapidly escalates into a grand conspiracy involving political power in Night City. It goes some wild directions before reaching its conclusion, and hints at some larger forces working in the background of Night City that are fun to speculate about.</p><p><strong>Available in:</strong> Act 2 after I Fought The Law</p><p><strong>How to acquire:</strong> Phone call from Jefferson Peralez</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="4d958f9aceaa208dc9dbd0d4c7519b02" data-recommend-id="image://4d958f9aceaa208dc9dbd0d4c7519b02" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="V and Johnny are shown facing off in Delamain's core." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="V and Johnny are shown facing off in Delamain's core." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->CD Projekt Red / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="4d958f9aceaa208dc9dbd0d4c7519b02" data-recommend-id="image://4d958f9aceaa208dc9dbd0d4c7519b02" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="V and Johnny are shown facing off in Delamain's core." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p><em>Cyberpunk 2077</em> has a few types of collectathon quests, but the Delamain cabs ones are probably the best. The questline starts with a simple call from Delamain, the AI that runs a self-driving cab service in Night City, as several of his cars have gone MIA around the city. Each AI-powered car you round up has a distinct personality. Some are great, like a car terrified of drive too fast that you have to carefully direct back to its home base. Some are obnoxious, like one that is literally just GLaDOS from <em>Portal</em>, which was a dated reference in 2020 and even more dated now.

The quest’s conclusion ends up leading you to something far more insidious than infidelity, making for one of the prime examples of <em>Cyberpunk 2077</em> saying “well that was fucked up, huh?” and just…moving on.

The online 5v5 multiplayer sports game features a behind-the-back, third-person camera angle instead of the more traditional broadcast-like view seen in other soccer games. Each player controls one of the 10 on-field players, leading to a more fast-paced, chaotic soccer experience.<span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.vice.com/en/article/sloclaps-rematch-final-beta-stats-are-revealed/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/sloclaps-rematch-final-beta-stats-are-revealed/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"> <em>Rematch’s </em>beta two weeks ago saw nearly 2 million players hopping into the game across consoles and PC</a></span>. At one point, over 175,000 concurrent players were kicking goals together on Steam. But sadly, these players won’t be able to share the pitch with folks on other platforms at launch. </p><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://x.com/PlayRematch/status/1934529603244028143&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://x.com/PlayRematch/status/1934529603244028143" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Early in the morning on June 16</a></span>, just hours before <em>Rematch’s </em>paid early access period kicked off, Sloclap confirmed that the online soccer game won’t support crossplay at launch and didn’t give a timeline on when it will arrive. </p><p>“Crossplay between Steam, PlayStation &amp; Xbox won’t be available at launch, but it’s one of our top priorities for upcoming updates! We’ll share an ETA as soon as possible, stay tuned!”</p><p>Many people were frustrated by the short notice, and others were disappointed that they wouldn’t be able to play <em>Rematch </em>with friends on other consoles at launch or soon after. However, the developers had previously hinted that crossplay might not be available on day one. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.reddit.com/media?url=https%3A%2F%2Fpreview.redd.it%2Fdoes-rematch-have-cross-progression-and-cross-play-v0-kv8cnw0s4b6f1.jpeg%3Fwidth%3D1080%26format%3Dpjpg%26auto%3Dwebp%26s%3D59e813b8a508135e2436384fca45e0f75fcd4080&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.reddit.com/media?url=https%3A%2F%2Fpreview.redd.it%2Fdoes-rematch-have-cross-progression-and-cross-play-v0-kv8cnw0s4b6f1.jpeg%3Fwidth%3D1080%26format%3Dpjpg%26auto%3Dwebp%26s%3D59e813b8a508135e2436384fca45e0f75fcd4080" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">That warning came in March in the game’s official Discord server</a></span>, with a Sloclap rep saying the team was doing its best to get crossplay in <em>Rematch </em>ready for launch, but couldn’t guarantee it would happen. That same rep claimed it would be added shortly after launch via an update if the team couldn’t get the feature working in time. </p><p>It is a bit funny how, in 2025, the idea of an online video game launching without crossplay is news. A few years ago, crossplay was still a relatively new concept, and it wasn’t a guarantee that a multiplayer game would support letting Xbox and PlayStation people play together. Now, if your game doesn’t ship with crossplay, it’s weird, and people get mad. We all really got used to crossplay being a given in a short amount of time, huh? </p><p><em>Rematch </em>is out now on PC, Xbox, PlayStation, and PC if you paid extra for the fancier editions of the game. It launches for everyone on June 19, when it will also become available via Game Pass on Xbox. </p><p> .<br></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
