            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Amazon just cut the price on what runners everywhere call their favorite workout companion: The<a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5452/"> Shokz OpenRun Pro bone conduction headphones have dropped to $124, down from their usual $179 price tag</a>. These aren’t your standard issue earbuds that block out the world around you: they use bone conduction technology to deliver audio through your cheekbones while keeping your ears completely open. It’s a design that makes them a go-to for runners who need to stay aware of traffic, fellow joggers, and their surroundings without sacrificing their workout playlist.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5452/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>



<h2>Why Choose Bone Conduction Over Traditional Earbuds</h2>
<p>The OpenRun Pro takes a fundamentally different tack with workout audio: traditional earbuds create a seal in your ear canal which might be OK on the gym floor but becomes a serious safety hazard when you take your runs outdoors. These <strong>headphones perch on your cheekbones and transmit sound through bone conduction</strong> and leave your ear canals wide open. You hear your music, podcasts, or calls clearly while simultaneously hearing cars approaching, cyclists calling out, or someone trying to get your attention on the trail.</p>
<p>The 9th generation represents years of refinement in bone conduction technology: They’re the first Shokz headphones built to take advantage of <em>TurboPitch</em> technology, a design that confronts the main critique of bone conduction models of the past. The <strong>bass response feels full and rich rather</strong> than tinny or weak. You get clear vocals across your favorite tracks, powerful volume when you need to bear down during tough intervals, and surprisingly deep low-end frequencies that other bone conduction models struggled to deliver.</p>



<p>The physical design solves problems that plague conventional workout headphones: <strong>A wraparound titanium frame weighs almost nothing</strong> but provides serious durability. This lightweight, titanium construction flexes to fit different head sizes without creating pressure points. The frame keeps the headphones locked in position through sprints, burpees, or mountain climbs during intense training sessions</p>
<p>Battery performance matches the requirements of the most serious athletes: The <strong>ten hours of continuous playback</strong> will handle everything from marathon training runs to full days of back-to-back activities. You charge them once and don’t worry about battery anxiety for days of normal use. The Quick Charge feature proves super-practical when you forget to plug them in overnight. <strong>Just five minutes charging gives you 1.5 hours of battery life</strong>.</p>
<p>The <strong>sweat-resistant construction</strong> handles whatever your workout throws at it. These headphones resist humid summer runs, aggressive HIIT sessions, and rainy morning jogs without degradation in performance.</p>
<p>At $124, these headphones cost less than most premium traditional sports earbuds and offer better situational awareness.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/this-lenovo-ideapad-slim-3-has-dropped-down-to-just-650-2000642541</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/lenovo-clears-out-amd-ryzen-5-gaming-laptop-at-62-off-from-premium-to-practically-budget.1349893/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>With us rushing right through to the end of the year, we find ourselves only a couple short weeks before one of the biggest savings events of the year — Black Friday and Cyber Monday. This will be a great time to save on a new TV, some kitchenware, or perhaps a new laptop. Even though we’re not quite there yet, you can already find some pretty lucrative deals and discounts ahead of schedule. Take a look at this IdeaPad Slim 3 laptop from Lenovo. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5451/">Amazon has it listed at $1,700, but current 62% discount ends up taking over a thousand dollars off the top. You only have to pay $650 for a limited time.</a></p>
<p>Ok so wait a minute. How can this possibly be $1,050 off. That seems too good to be true. Well, if we take a look at the price history, we can see that this laptop has only been listed by this seller since the beginning of this month. After a few days of being full price, it got this massive cut, bringing it to the level it is now. And if we look at Lenovo’s own website, we can find a similarly-specced IdeaPad Slim 3 going for just $660.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5451/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>



<p>So what gives? Well, lots of independent sellers like to artificially inflate the base price of their products so they can give them a huge markdown, giving the illusion of a great deal. And that’s a shame because this laptop is already a great value at this price.</p>
<h2>Diving Into the Specs</h2>
<p>What you get is an ultra-slim, lightweight laptop with a 15.3-inch screen powered by an AMD Ryzen 5 7535HS processor with an integrated graphics card. The Amazon listing does call it out as a gaming laptop, but the IdeaPad Slim 3 is better suited as a general-use laptop for everyday users. It still might be able to handle some lighter games that aren’t so graphically intensive. The laptop includes a full keypad, featuring a number pad which is a welcomed addition for anyone crunching numbers all day long.</p>



<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5451/">The laptop is working with 24GB of memory and a 1TB PCIe NVMe SSD for storage. It’s got support for Wi-Fi 6 for fast and stable internet speeds.</a> The ports along the side include two USB-A slots, a USB-C slot, an HDMI so you can connect to a second display, an SD card reader (great for photographers to have handy), and a classic 3.5mm headphone and microphone combination jack.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/sony-gives-an-update-on-marathon%E2%80%98s-launch-as-destiny-2-crumbles.1349890/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><span>It’s been almost four years since </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/sony-ps5-destiny-2-bungie-playstation-microsoft-xbox-ex-1848453326"><span>Sony acquired Bungie</span></a><span>, the developers of </span><i><span>Destiny 2 </span></i><span>and the creators of Microsoft’s flagship franchise </span><i><span>Halo, </span></i><span>for a whopping $3.6 billion. Now, as we approach the fourth anniversary of that transaction, it looks like Sony isn’t satisfied with the monetary return, as the company’s CFO and Corporate Executive Officer, Lin Tao, revealed that </span><i><span>Destiny 2 </span></i><span>has not met the PlayStation maker’s expectations.</span></p>

 <p><span>In Sony’s Q2 Fiscal Year 2025 earnings call (thanks, </span><a href="https://thisweekinvideogames.com/news/destiny-2-hasnt-reached-sonys-expectations-for-bungie-acquisition-says-cfo/"><i><span>This Week in Video Games</span></i></a><span>), Tao spoke about </span><i><span>Destiny 2</span></i><span> and said that its sales and player engagement have “not reached the expectations [Sony] had at the time of the acquisition of Bungie.”&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><span>“While we will continue to make improvements, we downwardly revised the business projection for the time being, and recorded an impairment loss against a portion of the assets at Bungie,” Tao said through an English translator.</span></p> <p><i><span>Destiny 2</span></i><span> is one side of Bungie’s business right now, while the other is the upcoming extraction shooter </span><i><span>Marathon</span></i><span>, which has faced some </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/marathon-alpha-review-impressions-bungie-extraction-fps-1851777775"><span>middling reception during its testing phase</span></a><span>. For now, Sony seems intent on releasing the game within this fiscal year, meaning sometime before March 2026. </span><i><span>Marathon</span></i><span> was </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/marathon-delay-bungie-feedback-prox-chat-solo-update-1851784674"><span>indefinitely delayed earlier this year to address feedback</span></a><span>, so it has no set launch date at this time. Bungie recently concluded another testing phase in October, and </span><a href="https://thisweekinvideogames.com/news/sony-cfo-on-bungies-marathon-as-needed-we-will-make-corrections/"><span>Tao says</span></a><span> the company is in the “process of analyzing the performance against [its internal] KPIs.”</span></p>

 <p><span>“We are fully dedicated to launching the title to schedule,” Tao said. “We will assume that we will launch this within this (financial) year, and that is included in the forecast.”</span></p> <p><span>While </span><i><span>Destiny 2</span></i><span> might be struggling in Sony’s eyes, Tao did say games like </span><i><span>Helldivers 2</span></i><span> and </span><i><span>MLB: The Show 25</span></i><span> have performed well, as far as the live-service section of the business goes. </span><i><span>Ghost of Yotei</span></i><span> has also sold 3.3 million copies since its launch last month, so PlayStation games are seeing some notable success in 2025.</span></p> <p><span>Bungie has been a big pillar of Sony’s </span><a href="https://thisweekinvideogames.com/news/sony-cfo-on-bungies-marathon-as-needed-we-will-make-corrections/"><span>attempts at carving a space in the live-service games market</span></a><span>, but the studio has been mired in controversy in the years since the acquisition. From </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/destiny-3-cancel-final-shape-expansions-bungie-payback-1851612404"><span>canceled projects</span></a><span> to </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/bungie-layoffs-destiny-2-final-shape-marathon-sony-ps5-1851609905"><span>widespread layoffs</span></a><span>, Bungie has been publicly struggling for a few years now, and things are </span><a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/bungie-devs-say-atmosphere-is-soul-crushing-amid-layoffs-cuts-and-fear-of-total-sony-takeover"><span>reportedly not great privately, either</span></a><span>. CEO Pete Parsons left the studio after 23 years </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/bungie-pete-parsons-halo-destiny-2-sony-2000619244"><span>back in August</span></a>.</p>

                                                      </p><div>
              
              <p>Back in July this year, <a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-presents-legends-z-a-unite-champions-netflix-1851786687">Nintendo held a <em>spectactularly</em> bad&nbsp;<em>Pokémon&nbsp;</em>Presents</a>, during which close to nothing was announced but for a shambolic reveal that there was going to be a new Pokémon theme park opening in 2026 called PokéPark Kanto. The announcement treated us to images of cheap, plastic Pokémon toys balanced on a table. Someone used the words “where Pokémon truly exist” to describe the supposed wonders of this place, while we saw fiberglass Pokémon put near some trees. It was amazing. Anyway, jump forward four months and an official opening date has been announced, along with a video showing…animated people visiting an animated park?</p>

 <p>I am very here for this ongoing weirdness. Part of me wishes it could all turn out to be some <a href="https://kotaku.com/willy-wonka-experience-fyre-fest-glasgow-1851292959">Willy Wonka Experience-type fiasco</a>, eventually opening on February 5 to reveal a bleak, near-empty warehouse with a few 3D-printed Pokémon toys and a lady wearing a yellow tracksuit and face paint telling crying children that she’s Pikachu. I realize, given this is The Pokémon Company (and therefore Nintendo), that’s not enormously likely. But it sure is being marketed like it should be! The park itself will be a part of an enormous theme park in Tokyo called Yomiuriland, and is described as “the first ever permanent Pokémon outdoor facility.”</p>

 <p>But first, that Direct footage is still making me laugh months later:</p> <figure><figcaption>The Pokémon Company / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p>And now we can add to it a superbly made animated trailer for the park that—because it’s an animated trailer that leans into the fantasy of the place—tells us literally nothing concrete or useful whatsoever. I’m going to go out on a limb and argue that The Pokémon Company has not successfully conducted some sort of gruesome genetic modification program and successfully bred real-world Pokémon to populate their park, so I suspect that we can at the very least reject the bit where there are Eevee and Pikachu scampering down the paths, or terrifying stampedes of Rhydon and Onyx as Pidgeo fly overheard. I am, however, willing to suspend my disbelief enough to accept that something a lot like Rattata might be present.</p>

  <p>OK, so let’s be fair; the website for the park <em>does</em> show some proof of existence, albeit very sparse. Among a&nbsp;lot of cartoon images we have what look like real-life photographs of a Pokémon Center, a Poké Mart and a Gym. And then, bizarrely, <a href="https://www.pokepark-kanto.co.jp/ppark/img/about/forest-poke-02.png">the same photographs</a> of fiberglass Eevee that we saw back in July.</p>

 <figure id="attachment_2000642910" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000642910"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000642910">© The Pokémon Company</figcaption></figure> <figure id="attachment_2000642912" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000642912"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000642912">© The Pokémon Company</figcaption></figure> <figure id="attachment_2000642913" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000642913"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000642913">© The Pokémon Company</figcaption></figure> <p>So don’t get me wrong. I would hop from foot to foot in gleeful excitement if I were able to go into a real, actual, full-size Pokémon Center, where I assume I would meet Nurse Joy herself. But again, I’m getting abandoned park vibes before this place even opens.</p>

 <p>There are to be three sections: Sedge Town, Pokémon Forest, and PokéPark Entrance Plaza, which will feature a Research Lab where you start your adventure. It remains opaque exactly how the whole thing will work, but you seem to be given a choice between a Bulbasaur, Charmander or Squirtle (“No Timothy, Pikachu wasn’t one of the original starters! Stop that crying!”), and then you’re off to explore the various areas. The Pokémon Center will apparently feature Chansey and allow you to heal your Pokémon (which itself implies a lot), while the Mart seems to be primarily a refreshment area. Beyond that, there’s an Eevee-themed carousel and something called Pika Pika Paradise powered by 30 Pikachu. These both require separate ticket purchases! Meanwhile, the Gym will be used for live performances. Which seems a shame, given the chance to offer a bunch of challenges for kids to complete, right? And some of these live shows require their own separate tickets too!</p> <p>Let’s hope it’s completely brilliant, and given that it’s being added to such an established and popular park, and created by The Pokémon Company itself, it really should be. But please can we have more of this super-weird marketing before any of that happens?</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/up-your-audio-quality-with-this-dji-mic-mini-bundle-down-to-its-lowest-price-yet-2000642562</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/dji-mic-mini-bundle-is-going-for-peanuts-likely-to-sell-out-at-this-all-time-low-price-before-black-friday-hits.1349848/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p data-start="0" data-end="680">If you’re creating content for TikTok, Instagram Reels, or YouTube Shorts, there’s one simple upgrade that can dramatically improve the quality of your videos: invest in a good microphone. It might sound minor, but clear, professional audio can make the difference between a clip that feels polished and one that viewers scroll past. Many creators focus heavily on lighting, cameras, and editing but overlook how crucial sound is. Even if your audience doesn’t consciously notice poor audio, they’ll feel that something’s off—and it can make your content seem less professional overall. The truth is, nine times out of ten, the issue isn’t your camera or setup; it’s your sound.</p>
<p data-start="682" data-end="909"><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5450/">Fortunately, fixing that doesn’t require a big budget. Right now, the DJI Mic Mini two-person vlog bundle is 41% off, bringing the price down from $169 to just $99.</a> That’s a $70 savings for a serious boost in quality.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5450/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>



<h2 data-start="682" data-end="909">Always Reliable Audio</h2>
<p data-start="911" data-end="1276">These compact wireless microphones are designed for creators who want great sound without bulky gear. Each mic weighs just 10 grams, making them ultra-light and discreet on camera. They clip on easily, look clean in your shots, and are comfortable to wear even during long recording sessions. Despite their small size, they deliver impressively rich, clear sound.</p>
<p data-start="1278" data-end="1621">One of the standout features is their maximum transmission range of 400 meters. That’s nearly a quarter mile. You can move freely while recording without worrying about losing signal or sound quality. Whether you’re filming casual vlogs, outdoor interviews, or travel content, this kind of range means flexibility and freedom of movement.</p>


<p data-start="1623" data-end="2138">The DJI Mic Mini system is built to handle noisy environments. Each mic includes pro-level noise cancellation with two adjustable intensity modes. The “Basic” setting is perfect for quiet indoor recordings, while “Strong” mode helps cut through background chatter or city noise when filming outside. Plus, an automatic volume limiter prevents distortion if the audio input spikes too high. That feature alone can save you a lot of frustration during post-production. No more clipped or unusable takes.</p>
<p data-start="2140" data-end="2416">Another great perk is compatibility. The DJI Mic Minis integrate smoothly with the DJI Osmo Audio ecosystem, pairing seamlessly with devices like the Osmo Action 5 Pro without needing a separate receiver. It’s plug-and-play simplicity, designed with creators in mind.</p>
<p data-start="2418" data-end="2646">Battery life is pretty great. Each transmitter and receiver can operate for up to 10 hours on a single charge, so you can record interviews, live streams, or full-day shoots without worrying about running out of juice. Combined with the included charging case, you can expect to have a total of 48 hours of life on a single charge.</p>

              <p>Nintendo is airing a <a href="https://kotaku.com/the-super-mario-galaxy-movie-spring-2026-2000625274"><em>Super Mario Galaxy Movie</em></a> Direct this week. It will include the upcoming sequel’s first full trailer. I’m on the edge of my seat wondering how it will deal with Yoshi.</p> <p>The livestream will be available Wednesday, November 12, at 9:00 a.m. ET for the special Nintendo Direct. “Please note that no game information will be included in this presentation,” the company cautioned. Still, that gives us the rest of the day to wrap our minds around whichever new stars have been cast to bring the latest trip back to the Mushroom Kingdom to life.</p>

  <p>Most importantly, the trailer will likely reveal what Illumination and Nintendo have decided to do with Yoshi’s voice. The green dinosaur was teased at the end of the first <em>Mario Bros. Movie</em> with an egg breaking open in the sewers beneath Brooklyn, and has since been all but confirmed via promotional imagery <a href="https://kotaku.com/your-first-look-at-yoshi-in-the-mario-galaxy-movie-comes-from-a-box-of-cookie-dough-2000642406">for cookie dough</a>.</p>

 <p>But Yoshi is not like most <em>Mario Bros</em>. characters. He’s not humanoid and doesn’t talk in the games. He just shouts “Yoshi!” in an adorable buttercream voice that just melts your heart. That seems like the most obvious approach for the<em> Mario Galaxy Movie</em>, which will seemingly have something to do with the titular plumber and pals exploring new worlds in the stars.</p>

 <p>The alternative is that Yoshi talks and sounds human. Despite the horror, that seems like a non-zero possibility. I’m imagining something like Idris Elba’s version of Knuckles in the Sonic movies: a completely earnest delivery in a vaguely cockney accent that is at once both completely bizarre and yet somehow fitting. I would love for Nintendo and Illumination to really go for something wild here.</p> <p>Give us Nicholas Cage in the role of a lifetime. Even if it’s just him screaming “Yoshi!” every five minutes.</p>

              <p>We’re still a couple weeks shy of Black Friday and Cyber Monday. While you can expect to find lots of deals over that late-November weekend across consumer tech and pretty every every other category of products, that doesn’t mean you can’t find any lucrative deals right now. The Apple AirPods 4 are just over a year old and are now seeing a pretty significant discount. It’s a great time to pick up a pair if you’ve been holding out. The base model of Apple’s versatile earbuds released at the price of $129. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3769/">Right now, Amazon has them for 34% off, brining the price to just $85. You’ll end up saving yourself a good $44</a>. If you want to upgrade to the model with support for active noise cancellation, you can expect a 16% discount. That pair normally goes for $179, but the deal ends up shaving off $30 so you only have to pay $149 for a limited time.</p>
<p>AirPods have been around for a while now with Apple adding in some incremental improvements with each generation. The latest version in the Apple AirPods 4 feature a refined contour with a shorter stem and quick-press controls for music. Apple put a lot of focus on all-day comfort this time around.</p>

<h2>Isolate Sound</h2>
<p>You can expect better sound quality when it comes to calls all thanks to the new H2 chipset Apple designed. The new chip enables voice isolation to remove background noises. Folks on the other end of the call will be hearing you and only you, even if you’re in a crowded, noisy environment. The AirPods are able to eliminate sounds coming from around you so you come across perfectly clear.</p>
<p>Likewise, you can expect to better audio quality on your end because of the H2 chip. the new acoustic architecture is designed for crystal clear highs and deep bass.</p>



<p>A nice little addition to the AirPods feature set is how the buds interact with Apple’s voice assistant. Sire can now interpret basic gestures such as nodding yes or shaking your head no as a response to question. Not sure which seems weirder though for someone sitting across from you on the subway. You doing that, or you just blankly saying “Yes” or “No” allowed to no one in particular.</p>
<p>Something you can see different between the AirPods 4 and the previous model right away in a side-by-side is Apple has finally done away with the proprietary Lightning port. The case for the AirPods now charge using the now standard USB-C which is a welcome change indeed.</p>
