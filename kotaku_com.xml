And, in a series first, it comes with a mode that removes many choices, instead adhering to one “canonical” narrative path. Now Ubisoft has explained why this option was added and also clarified that you’ll still be free to kiss whoever you want even if you pick the Canon Mode. </p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="196406" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="Why This Under-the-Radar AAA Title Is More Than Just A Far Cry Clone" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="102" data-playlist="196406,195776,196165" data-current="196406"><div><p>Why This Under-the-Radar AAA Title Is More Than Just A Far Cry Clone</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196406/196406_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196406/196406_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196406/196406_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196406/196406_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/21954.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/assassins-creed-always-online-steam-deck-ubi-connect-1851767074&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/assassins-creed-always-online-steam-deck-ubi-connect-1851767074"><em>Assassin’s Creed Shadows</em></a></span>, set in feudal Japan and starring two very different protagonists, launches later this month. When fans boot it up, they’ll have an ironic choice to make: During your playthrough, do you want to make choices or not? You can play <em>Shadows </em>like most RPGs, choosing what to say to certain people to affect the outcome of a questline or story arc. Or you can choose Canon Mode, which removes such choices and tells a set story created by Ubisoft. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/assassins-creed-shadows-ubisoft-canon-mode-1851719396&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/assassins-creed-shadows-ubisoft-canon-mode-1851719396">But why is this previously confirmed Canon Mode</a></span> even in the game? Well, Ubisoft says it’s because of fan “disappointment” over the way all the dialogue options in games like<em> Assassin’s Creed Odyssey</em> and <em>Valhalla </em>prevented the creation of a single “canonical” record of how those stories played out.</p><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://gamerant.com/assassins-creed-shadows-canon-mode-creation-why/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://gamerant.com/assassins-creed-shadows-canon-mode-creation-why/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">In a recent interview with <em>Gamerant</em></a></span>, creative director Jonathan Dumont talked about the Canon Mode in <em>Shadows</em>. According to him, while many fans have loved the RPG choices in recent <em>AC </em>games, others missed the fact that there was no longer a single, agreed-upon metanarrative. </p><p>  “When we introduced a choice of characters and dialogue choices in <em>AC Odyssey</em>, many of our fans loved the idea, but some expressed their disappointment in not having a definitive and canon narrative for the game that could be embedded in the <em>AC</em> lore meta story, “ said Dumont. </p><p>“After speaking with our fans during development, we decided to add a mode that takes out all the choices for <em>Shadows </em>and that can serve as a reference story within the franchise. This way players can enjoy the more RPG style of narrative or a more linear one, if they prefer.” </p><p>It’s yet another example of how Ubisoft is extremely focused on ensuring that both old school <em>Assassin’s Creed </em>fans—who prefer linearity and stealth—and newer fans—who prefer RPG-flavored open-world action—are happy when they play <em>Shadows</em>. </p><p>For those who crave a more traditional <em>Assassin’s Creed</em> experience, you can turn on instant assassinations,  play almost entirely as classic assassin Naoe, and  turn off all dialogue choices, too. On the flip side, you can play the game like <em>Valhalla </em>and mostly fight your way through crowds of enemies with big swords while making hard decisions. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/assassins-creed-shadows-4-hour-preview-hands-on-review-1851745403&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/assassins-creed-shadows-4-hour-preview-hands-on-review-1851745403">As I experienced in my preview with the game earlier this year</a></span>, <em>Shadows </em>truly feels like an <em>Assassin’s Creed</em> designed from the ground up to make all fans happy. </p><p>However, regardless of whether you play in canon mode or not, Ubisoft will let you romance and kiss any romanceable character you desire. This was confirmed by associate narrative director Brooke Davies while speaking to <em>Gamerant</em>. </p><p> “Because Naoe and Yasuke are different people, they each have unique romance possibilities and connections,” said Davies. “None of our love stories is canon, so players can choose for themselves who—or who not—to pursue.” </p><p><em>Assassin’s Creed Shadows </em>launches on PS5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC on March 20. </p><p> .<br></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Its innovation was trading a set party of heroes for a cast of 108 total characters who could be recruited on your adventure. Combined with a world of rune-based magic and political intrigue, <em>Suikoden I </em>and <em>II</em> managed to carve out a unique lane in a crowded field, and now both games have finally been updated with modern bells and whistles for current platforms. </p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="196411" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="A Typical Day On Persona 3 Reload’s Tatsumi Port Island" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="378" data-playlist="196411,196646,196215" data-current="196411"><div><p>A Typical Day On Persona 3 Reload’s Tatsumi Port Island</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196411/196411_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196411/196411_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196411/196411_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196411/196411_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/21958.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>I’ve played around a bit with the <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/nintendo-direct-august-2024-everything-announced-1851632968/slides/24&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/nintendo-direct-august-2024-everything-announced-1851632968/slides/24"><em>Suikoden I &amp; II HD Remaster</em> collection</a></span>, which technically includes the much longer subtitle “Gate Rune and Dunan Unification Wars,” and am pleased to report two main takeaways. First, these JRPGs still have the juice, especially <em>Suikoden II</em>. The snappy turn-based combat and open-ended collect-em-all-fest holds up 30 years later, with decent storytelling and even better character writing. </p><p>Second, both games have survived the journey from low-resolution 4:3 aspect ratio to 16:9 HD <em>mostly</em> intact and looking better than ever, especially in <em>Suikoden II</em>. The character sprites remain perfectly pixelated-looking without any smoothed-over upscaling effects or muddy silhouettes. The backgrounds, never a series highlight, look crisp and get the job done. The tiling of its top-down world can feel a bit bland and repetitive, but certain scenes with more detailed shadows and lighting really pop. Most importantly, the battles still look and feel great, at least to the eyes of someone who grew up with these games back in the ‘90s. Things are less great in <em>Suikoden I</em> where some environments look weirdly flat and empty. </p><figure id="" data-id="d7e22e5989ceecc9e18004a394b766ee" data-recommend-id="image://d7e22e5989ceecc9e18004a394b766ee" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Characters fight a bug in battle.

The first game is about 20 hours long and focuses mainly on recruiting characters to aid you in your fight against the evil Scarlet Moon Empire, while the second is longer, much more narratively dense, and a bit more morally grey and complex. </p><p>Both are propelled along by random encounters and boss fights, toil made much better than in some other games thanks to <em>Suikoden</em>’s old-school but flashy turn-based formula and the fact that you’re always finding new characters with unique abilities, strengths, and weaknesses to fight alongside. Instead of just three or four characters, you get to fight with six, with front and back rows as well as synergistic combo attacks adding to the strategy. None of it felt  revolutionary at the time like the multi-cam cinematic quality of <em>Final Fantasy VII</em> battles, but it’s crunchy and well-balanced as far as conventional turn-based combat goes.</p><figure id="" data-id="ec7665b9604a75378ac2a78cc4160011" data-recommend-id="image://ec7665b9604a75378ac2a78cc4160011" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A character runs across a town.

" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>So what improvements and new quality-of-life features does the <em>Suikoden I &amp; II HD Remaster</em> collection bring to the party? Aside from the graphical overhaul and updated script (the original localized versions were far from perfect), there are standard additions like auto-saves (<span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://astrolabe.aidanmoher.com/suikoden-hd-remaster-review/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://astrolabe.aidanmoher.com/suikoden-hd-remaster-review/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">though only on a screen with a save point?</a></span>) and a menu log that keeps a record of what people have told you. There’s no mini-map but you can sprint from the start now. You can speed up fights to auto-battle through them quickly, though weirdly the music speeds up during this as well. Plus there are optional difficulty modes now. The ability to turn off timed events is coming in a day-one update (certain characters can’t be recruited if the in-game clock ticks past a certain point). </p><p>It’s unfortunate that you can’t speed up the game outside of battle, and it feels like a missed opportunity not to have the option to turn on the game’s old graphics and aspect ratio for enthusiasts who want to revisit the original experience on PS1. The inventory systems in both games are also still a pain (though not nearly as clunky as how they were left in the recent <em>Dragon Quest III HD-2D Remake</em>). An in-game gallery, museum, or other historical feature would have been a nice bonus as well, especially for the $50 price tag. The bar keeps rising for modern remasters of all-time classics, and it certainly feels like there was room for <em>Suikoden I &amp; II HD Remaster </em>to be a more comprehensive package. </p><p>It doesn’t make any major missteps, though, which can’t be said for every PS1 JRPG that gets an HD makeover. <em>Suikoden I &amp; II HD Remaster</em> presents one good game and one excellent one (it’s sacrilege to say but if you’re short on time I think you should just play<em> II</em>) with everything a modern player needs to enjoy two genre classics (well, except for maybe an option to turn off random encounters). Konami has already announced an anime adaptation of <em>Suikoden II </em>and a new <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/suikoden-star-leap-trailer-gacha-mobile-konami-date-1851767567&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/suikoden-star-leap-trailer-gacha-mobile-konami-date-1851767567">mobile spin-off called<em> Star Leap </em>that looks beautiful but has gacha microtransactions</a></span>. If this burgeoning <em>Suikoden</em> renaissance is successful, though, maybe we’ll finally get<em> Suikoden VI</em>, or at least <em>Suikoden III</em> as a PS2 classic on PlayStation 5.  </p><p><strong><em>Update 3/5/2025 2:29 p.m. ET: </em></strong><em>Added a link to Aidan Moher’s review </em><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://astrolabe.aidanmoher.com/suikoden-hd-remaster-review/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://astrolabe.aidanmoher.com/suikoden-hd-remaster-review/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>which discovered the auto-save feature is basically a lie</em></a></span><em>. </em></p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
