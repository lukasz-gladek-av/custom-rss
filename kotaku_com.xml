              <p><span>Gaming executive Larry Hyrb, aka Major Nelson, has revealed this week that he’s out at the game engine maker Unity. The Xbox veteran joined as Director of Community and Advocacy only a couple of years ago.</span></p> <p><span>“After nearly three decades of making an impact at Microsoft, I joined Unity in 2024. During my time there, I rebuilt their Community and Advocacy Team with a deliberate strategy that created a clearer, more connected experience for creators, developers, and gamers,” Hyrb </span><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/hryb_ive-always-been-transparent-with-this-community-activity-7416864352840085504-MDJc?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=member_desktop&amp;rcm=ACoAACLzsjMBiEcKGm66u9szH_XVpdQ1NU1SZcQ"><span>explained on LinkedIn</span></a><span>.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>Hyrb continued: “We brought energy back to channels that had gone quiet, restored trust, and showed up consistently where it mattered. I elevated Unity’s visibility at PAX and key industry events, strengthened relationships, and ensured Unity had a clear voice in the broader conversation.”</span></p>   <p><span>It’s not exactly clear when Hyrb was laid off or if the departure is part of a bigger wave of fresh cuts at the software company. “I’ve had invigorating conversations over the past weeks with companies in tech and non-tech spaces to discuss partnerships,” he said on </span><a href="https://bsky.app/profile/hryb.me/post/3mccuyabbv22d"><span>BlueSky</span></a><span>. “I love what I do but I also believe change is necessary. I’ll let you know where I go from here.”</span></p>

 <p><span>Major Nelson was previously an important public figure within the Xbox community. He spent almost 23 years at Microsoft, fostering the Xbox Live community and promoting the Xbox 360’s user-facing features, including the Achievement system, cloud saves, in-game messaging, and party chat.</span></p>

  <p><span>He left </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/xbox-major-nelson-larry-hryb-official-podcast-microsoft-1850642324"><span>Microsoft back in 2023</span></a><span>, a move that preceded Xbox’s pivot to being multiplatform and a </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/microsoft-xbox-game-pass-ps5-exclusives-streaming-1851722886"><span>broader marketing strategy</span></a><span> that didn’t have a single piece of hardware at its center. The brand hasn’t been as public facing, let alone as community-first, since Hyrb’s departure.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><span>Unity has had a rough several years. In 2023, Unity announced that it would install a new Runtime Fee, but was eventually </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/unity-install-runtime-fees-canceled-ceo-blog-post-price-1851647405"><span>reversed due to immense backlash from developers</span></a><span>. A few months later, then CEO </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/unity-john-riccitiello-ea-intall-fee-resign-fifa-madden-1850914295"><span>John Riccitiello stepped down</span></a><span>. In 2024, </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/unity-layoffs-1800-people-jobs-25-percent-january-2024-1851150254"><span>Unity laid off a massive chunk of its workforce</span></a><span>, eliminating around 1,800, or 25%, of its employees. Last year, Unity then </span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/report-unity-continues-layoffs-with-abrupt-communications-and-5am-emails"><span>laid off its Behavior team</span></a><span>.</span></p>

              <p><span>In a move that will surprise absolutely no one who has paid attention to </span><i><span>Pokémon </span></i><span>in the past five years, the </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-lego-sets-release-date-price-pikachu-charizard-2000658895"><span>very expensive Lego sets</span></a><span> featuring </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/comparing-legos-new-200-pikachu-set-to-mega-bloks-50-version-2000658904"><span>Pikachu, Eevee</span></a><span>, and the Kanto starters are selling out pretty fast. When Pokémon merchandise sells out, it inevitably ends up on reseller sites like </span><a href="https://www.ebay.com/sch/i.html?_nkw=charizard+lego&amp;_sacat=0&amp;_from=R40&amp;_trksid=p2332490.m570.l1313"><span>Ebay</span></a><span> for astronomical prices. What do you get when you scalp already expensive toy blocks? Prices that’ll cost you enough to buy multiple game consoles and video games.</span></p> <p><span>The set featuring Charizard, Blastoise, and Venusaur is supposed to run for $649.99, but now that pre-orders are selling out, resellers are listing the 6800+ pieces of Lego blocks for anywhere from </span><a href="https://www.ebay.com/sch/i.html?_nkw=Lego+pokemon+badges&amp;_sacat=0&amp;_from=R40&amp;_trksid=p4624852.m570.l1313"><span>$800 to over a grand</span></a><span>. Some of the listings include the Kanto Badges set that is being offered to those who bought the starters, while there are others that have only one of the three monsters for sale, despite them not being sold separately by Lego itself. I guess despite the reseller markup, if you really only wanted one of them, this would be cheaper than buying all three at retail price. Live your truth.</span></p>

 <p><span>Though that’s the most expensive of the sets, it’s not the only one that scalpers got a hold of to flip and turn a profit. The </span><a href="https://www.ebay.com/itm/257306955329?_skw=pokemon+lego&amp;itmmeta=01KEW627JW5AGPJKXJZ60CN4GG&amp;hash=item3be8b08e41:g:lnkAAeSwn0VpZm0T&amp;itmprp=enc%3AAQALAAAA8O7PUuNWmJ%2B%2BUShgI9tQz%2FpNjcghLv%2BTt%2FEVUa7n%2BFKBL3oQ%2BSztckicHbIHKISlddEAhuGmBnxMjo0MNMFFWsHQKGE3fQ6%2Bk94YIwi28ayFOVrzfonRqCks5ykLmQY8zsw60phy2xhRnY%2BCeqasoyUR3ZK%2B9hT3pqDCx%2B3Lly7uxDfgI93mX%2B4NkWiiVl6caiC8OqhC8sPU22%2FjDgWq3vrU2ZBGcrGj82jQVPb96lsqdRQ2bJdcIZcW%2BGd1nQ5VA8yrjS2KHllSMOwrbcr%2FAnsNGqlG4eG1MEBrXvydhlFpwXrepxxc5K%2BrcjjwNUMkqA%3D%3D%7Ctkp%3ABk9SR9r5iIb3Zg"><span>Pikachu</span></a><span> model is also popping up, though it is much, much cheaper than the Kanto trio. Before you hop on that one, though, do keep in mind that pre-orders for the Pikachu and Eevee models haven’t sold out in the U.S. yet, so you can still get those (very expensive) blocky boys for their original price.</span></p>

 <p><span>The </span><i><span>Pokémon </span></i><span>Lego sets will be available in stores on February 27, which marks the series’ 30th anniversary. We’ll also be expecting some major announcements from the company’s annual “Pokémon Day” stream, which usually covers games, toys, and pretty much every other facet of the franchise. </span></p>
