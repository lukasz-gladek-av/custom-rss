              <p>Is the Switch 2 doomed to be a physical graveyard of third-party game key cards? Why are so many new special edition controllers so ugly? And has Amazon really pulled the plug on its fledgling <em>Lord of the Rings</em> MMO? It‚Äôs another edition of Morning Checkpoint,&nbsp;<em>Kotaku</em>‚Äòs daily roundup of gaming news and culture.</p> <p>I don‚Äôt need any more gaming devices in my life but I‚Äôm obsessed with the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xd8eqcbZsKo">latest batch</a> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVAHh-DmDu8">of DS knock-offs</a> out of China. Nintendo is really leaving money on the table by not shipping its own legacy handhelds. I mean, people were so desperate for a new Game Boy <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JiDrCRSRUHM">they hacked the Lego one</a> so it could run games.</p>

 <h2>The Switch 2 <em>Resident Evil Requiem</em> Pro controller looks bad</h2>   <p>It‚Äôs the same dark shade as the normal Pro controller but with graphics from an in-game newspaper over the front. The words <em>Resident Evil</em> are also there but largely interrupted by the central Switch 2 logo. Truly a bummer. In other bad news, the Switch 2 version of <em>Resident Evil Requiem</em> has been confirmed to be a game key card. Rip.</p>

 <h2>Amazon Games dev suggests its <em>Lord of the Rings</em> MMO has been canceled</h2> <p>As spotted <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/amazon-have-reportedly-cancelled-their-lord-of-the-rings-mmo-again">by<em> Rock, Paper, Shotgun</em></a>, developer Ashleigh Amrine made a now-deleted post on LinkedIn about the layoffs that hinted at the game no longer being in production. ‚ÄúThis morning I was part of the layoffs at Amazon Games, alongside my incredibly talented peers on&nbsp;<em>New World</em>&nbsp;and our fledgling <em>Lord of the Rings</em> game (y‚Äôall would have loved it),‚Äù she&nbsp;<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/ashleighamrine_opentowork-gamedev-activity-7388971058642522112-H2mY/">wrote</a>.</p>

 <p>Amazon did not respond to a request for comment about whether the project has been killed. It‚Äôs always possible the company is still still looking to offload the project or just license it out to another studio. If that game ever does come to market, however, it‚Äôll probably bare no relation to whatever early prototype the <em>New World</em> devs were working on.</p>

 <h2>Xbox hardware revenue is still in freefall</h2> <p>Microsoft announced its <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/Investor/earnings/FY-2026-Q1/press-release-webcast">second quarter earnings</a> yesterday. While Azure cloud services and its AI gambles continue to pay off, the gaming division actually shrunk. Xbox gaming revenues were down $113 million with already terrible hardware numbers down 29 percent year over year.</p>

 <p>It‚Äôs worth noting that this was the same quarter when Microsoft jacked up the Xbox Series X/S consoles to $400 and $600 respectively due to Trump‚Äôs trade war. Somehow I don‚Äôt think a <a href="https://kotaku.com/next-gen-xbox-paid-multiplayer-game-pass-2000639263">more expensive PC-like next-gen console</a> with no exclusives will turn that around.</p>

But bigger-ticket changes like FOV sliders and better saving options are on the docket for upcoming patches.</p> <h2>AI slop will not replace video games</h2> <p>That‚Äôs according to Take-Two CEO Strauss Zelnick who happens to oversee some of the biggest and most critically acclaimed franchises in the world with <em>Grand Theft Auto</em>, <em>Red Dead Redemption</em>, and <i>BioShock</i>.

              <p>It would be hard to blame Nintendo for becoming used to getting its way when it comes to courts. In case after case, <a href="https://kotaku.com/nintendo-switch-piracy-reddit-mod-archbox-million-2000631966">the Japanese behemoth crushes its prey</a>, scoring millions in damages. But when it comes to the increasingly complex attempt to take down the enormous success of creature-collecting survival game&nbsp;<em>Palworld</em>, Nintendo has just taken a big blow, being denied a vital patent.</p> <p>In one of the more peculiar twists of the lengthy battle between <em>Pok√©mon</em> owners Nintendo and&nbsp;<em>Palworld</em> creators Pocketpair, Nintendo submitted a few new or revised patents to the courts to attempt to retrospectively claim rights to specific gaming mechanics. While some might very sensibly consider the idea of a gaming mechanic being something someone could patent as anathema to all of art and creativity, and to be rank hypocrisy in an industry that‚Äôs entirely built on top of mechanics created by previous generations, it‚Äôs still somehow a thing. And a thing Nintendo was rather heavily relying on in its court case against <em>Palworld.</em></p>

 <p>When&nbsp;<a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-palworld-ai-art-copyright-law-pocketpair-1851186580?_gl=1*21id2z*_ga*MTk4MjkyODk2OS4xNzExNTYxOTM0*_ga_V4QNJTT5L0*MTcyNjcwMzk2My4xODguMS4xNzI2NzA0MDI1LjYwLjAuMA.."><em>Palworld</em> first appeared in January 2024</a>, pretty much everyone‚Äôs reaction was to laugh at the absolutely blatant copies of very familiar Pok√©mon that appeared in the game. It seems Nintendo wanted to take action, but suing over pastiches of their characters is a tricky business, so eight months later <a href="https://kotaku.com/nintendo-pokemon-palworld-lawsuit-pocketpair-patent-1851654149">the company instead opted for going after&nbsp;<em>Palworld</em>‚Äòs creature-capturing mechanics</a>‚Äîthrowing an orb that then captures the animal‚Äîthat are most familiar from <em>Pok√©mon</em> games.</p>

 <p>And it only got weirder. <a href="https://kotaku.com/nintendo-pokemon-palworld-patents-lawsuit-pocketpair-1851692965">When we finally got the details of the lawsuit in November of last year</a>, it became apparent that Nintendo and The Pok√©mon Company were suing for less than $70,000, and the basis for its case were all patents the company had filed in that year,&nbsp;after&nbsp;<em>Palworld</em> had been released. Three patents were cited, the first based on throwing a Pok√© Ball to start combat, the second a tweak of an older patent to update it to capturing Pok√©mon in the wild, and the third the most extraordinary, a claim to rights for a simple transition onto rideable creatures in open worlds.</p>

 <h2>Who hunts the monster hunters?</h2> <p>Jump to today, and it seems this tactic isn‚Äôt entirely panning out. <a href="https://gamesfray.com/japan-patent-office-rejects-nintendo-application-relevant-to-palworld-dispute-cites-games-like-ark-as-prior-art-after-third-party-submission/"><em>Games Fray</em></a> noticed that the Japanese Patent Office has suggested two of these three patents are pretty dubious. The issue, it seems, is Nintendo‚Äôs attempt to update its former patents to include the more open-world elements of <em>Pok√©mon&nbsp;</em>games since 2022, despite the wealth of prior examples of such mechanics appearing far earlier in other open-world titles. According to&nbsp;<em>Games Fray</em>, the patent office cited examples like <em>Monster Hunter 4</em>,&nbsp;<em>ARK</em>, and even Pocketpair‚Äôs own&nbsp;<em>Craftopia</em>. Oh, and to really stick it home,&nbsp;<em>Pok√©mon GO</em>.</p>

 <p>Now Nintendo has to decide between abandoning this specific route in the increasingly ridiculous legal action (never forget that while&nbsp;<em>Palworld</em> was absolutely mimicking Pok√©mon designs, it just simply isn‚Äôt a similar type of game, instead focused on survival and crafting), or petitioning the patent office to accept its case.</p> <p>It‚Äôs just‚Ä¶the case is gross. Developers shouldn‚Äôt be able to patent mechanics, and had it ever been a common part of games design, we simply wouldn‚Äôt have video games. Everything you play is built on the shoulders of what came before.&nbsp;<em>Donkey Kong</em> may have an argument to be the first ever platform game, but it doesn‚Äôt exist without&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crazy_Climber"><em>Crazy Climber</em></a> and&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_Panic"><em>Space Panic</em></a>. Pocketpair deliberately provoked Nintendo, and Nintendo foolishly fell for it, and the result is years of expensive litigation for no meaningful results.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><span>This morning, Nintendo casually announced that </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/animal-crossing-new-horizons-switch-2-edition-update-free-2000640118"><i><span>Animal Crossing: New Horizons</span></i><span> is getting a Switch 2 update</span></a><span> to make it run better and use some of the device‚Äôs more powerful tech for quality-of-life improvements. Alongside this, Nintendo is also releasing a 3.0 update that includes new features, crossover items, and a whole new creator mode that exists in your character‚Äôs dreams. This is the first major update </span><i><span>New Horizons </span></i><span>has received since 2021, and at a certain point, you kind of accept that a game is probably no longer a developer‚Äôs priority and they‚Äôve likely shifted their attention elsewhere. So the reveal that a huge update is coming has reawakened the </span><i><span>Animal Crossing </span></i><span>community like a sleeper agent, and they‚Äôre in a state of disbelief.</span></p> <figure id="attachment_2000640149" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000640149"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000640149">¬© YouTube / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p><span>The Switch 2 upgrade and the 3.0 update are bringing some surprising changes to </span><i><span>New Horizons</span></i><span>, including crossover items from </span><i><span>The Legend of Zelda</span></i><span> and </span><i><span>Splatoon</span></i><span>, as well as general Nintendo memorabilia, and, oddly enough, a bunch of Lego furniture pieces. Some </span><i><span>Zelda </span></i><span>characters will even appear as villagers in the new update, which raises questions about whether or not </span><i><span>Animal Crossing</span></i><span> takes place in the </span><i><span>Smash Bros. </span></i><span>multiverse.

              <p>You don‚Äôt have to change the entire wiring in your home just to improve the lighting situation. A simple ceiling fixture swap can do the job too, and it costs way less than a full-blown lighting overhaul. Even better, we just spotted an already-affordable smart ceiling light going for way less on Amazon.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5108/">The retailer has dropped the price of the Govee Smart RGBIC LED ceiling light to just $50, thanks to a $30 discount on its usual $80 tag</a>.
