And while going back to this 20 minute show is a bit embarrassing now, it’s wild how Microsoft and Xbox really did see the future coming before the rest of the industry. </p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="197533" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="Why People Are Rushing To Sell Their Xbox Series X To GameStop Right Now" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="105" data-playlist="197533,196181,196230" data-current="197533"><div><p>Why People Are Rushing To Sell Their Xbox Series X To GameStop Right Now</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197533/197533_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197533/197533_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197533/197533_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/23065.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>But before we praise <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/xbox-celebrates-20th-anniversary-with-a-museum-that-mig-1848113162&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/xbox-celebrates-20th-anniversary-with-a-museum-that-mig-1848113162">Xbox</a></span> for predicting the online future of games and get really sad at how cosmetic microtransactions were already part of the plan in 2005, let’s make fun of this weird 20 minute infomercial that is the most ‘00s thing ever created. Here’s the full special if you’ve not seen it: </p><p>“Fact: Gaming isn’t just a hobby. It is a lifestyle,” says an unnamed narrator during a short video at the front of the special. It explains video gaming started with <em>Pong</em> and Atari,  some other stuff happened, then the original Xbox launched and don’t worry about that thing called the PlayStation. </p><p>After that, the funniest moment in the entire special happens. Remember, up until this point we didn’t know the console was to be called the Xbox 360. It was just the “Next Gen Xbox.” So young Zack, who watched this MTV special back in 2005, was excited to learn more about the next Xbox. Elijah Wood yells, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://youtu.be/LTs0AoaMYGA?t=166&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://youtu.be/LTs0AoaMYGA?t=166" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">“The future of gaming!” and points off screen</a></span>. The camera cuts to a...woman carrying a gray bag. Can you imagine the online chuds today watching this? Their heads might explode. </p><figure id="" data-id="74bd24e62beb56dfa61ab2411665a669" data-recommend-id="image://74bd24e62beb56dfa61ab2411665a669" data-format="png" data-width="639" data-height="360" data-lightbox="true" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Xbox /hunchbiscuit / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="74bd24e62beb56dfa61ab2411665a669" data-recommend-id="image://74bd24e62beb56dfa61ab2411665a669" data-format="png" data-width="639" data-height="360" data-lightbox="true" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>In reality, the woman is carrying the Xbox 360 in her shoulder bag. She saunters up to a podium and pulls out the console. Sets it up. Hits a button. Green lights turn on. And the console’s name is revealed.</p><p>The rest of special is mostly MTV nonsense, celebrities, and The Killers performing music. The only segment that is actually somewhat interesting happens about 11 minutes into the show: Sway from MTV is invited to talk to the designers behind the Xbox 360 and J Allard (one of the OG Microsoft execs behind the Xbox project.) It’s during this segment that we see a bunch of 360 prototypes and learn about why it looks the way it does. And then Allard walks Sway through the idea of buying digital content on a video game console using the internet. </p><p>Today, this is something every device can do. Back in 2005, this was the future. It was hard for young Zack to believe that one day we’d buy games digitally on a console. 20 years later, it’s clear Microsoft was on to something with Xbox Live, the marketplace, a single username that follows you from game to game, and hanging out online with friends in voice chat. Though, the moment when Allard mentions buying clothes for your digital character, I realized microtransactions were being invented in front of my eyes and got sad. </p><p>At the end of the event, Wood got on stage and signed off by saying: “I think we can all agree on one thing tonight: Xbox 360 is going to be amazing and I look forward to meeting all of you in the Xbox 360 universe.” I never met Elijah Wood online. But I do agree, the Xbox 360 was amazing and will likely be the one and only time Microsoft was at the top of the console gaming market. </p><p>&nbsp;.<br></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

These days it feels like you need a pedantic, encyclopedia-level recall of in-universe minutiae to really call yourself that, which I certainly don’t have. Like a lot of folks, I’m mostly just here for vibes and battles. But somehow <em>Andor</em> has bridged that divide and made me appreciate all of those little details that classic <em>Star Wars </em>fans are always gooning over. It did it with a single blaster I haven’t thought about in years. </p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="197562" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="THPS 3+4 Does Away With The OG 4's Career Mode, Here's Why" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="118" data-playlist="197562,197559,197556" data-current="197562"><div><p>THPS 3+4 Does Away With The OG 4's Career Mode, Here's Why</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197562/197562_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197562/197562_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197562/197562_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/23086.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p><strong><em>Spoiler Warning:</em></strong><em> If you’re not caught up on </em>Andor <em>season 2 this is your cue to turn back. The thing I’m going to share isn’t a major spoiler in and of itself, but why it works so well requires delving into some of the show’s biggest moments up through the most recent episode 9. </em></p><p>Okay, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/andor-s2-episode-7-8-9-review-vgchat-recap-star-wars-1851780084&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/andor-s2-episode-7-8-9-review-vgchat-recap-star-wars-1851780084">so near the end of the last episode</a></span>, rebel operative Vel is at the rebellion’s base on Yavin taking stock of the armaments. She notices an insignia on one of the guns and asks the group of new recruits who it belongs to. A guy in the back claims it as his own, and although his face looked really familiar, I couldn’t quite place it. The moment doesn’t linger for long and it also serves as a nod to the rebellion’s growing ranks, but I still had the nagging feeling I was supposed to recognize a deeper meaning to the exchange. </p><p>My instinct was right. While idly scrolling X over the weekend I came across a <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://x.com/RedTeamReview/status/1920875503889608810&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://x.com/RedTeamReview/status/1920875503889608810" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">post by YouTuber RedTeamReview</a></span> that used a handful of screenshots to trace the backstory of the gun in question. It turns out it’s the gun Cassian took from Syril Karn in season 1 when the latter was trying to apprehend him for the unsolved murders on Morlana One in episode 3. Later, Arvel Skeen asks Cassian where he got it ahead of the heist on the imperial base on Aldhani. Arvel notes it’s “corpo issued” and Cassian simply responds, “Didn’t get a name.” </p><p>Cassian later hides it in his apartment on the beachy resort planet of Niamos only to get captured and sent to the prison on Narkina 5. After spurring the revolt there, he escapes alongside another inmate named Ruescott Melshi. They get back to Niamos and Cassian gives him Syril’s blaster as they agree to split up for a better chance at survival and spreading the message of what happened to them on Narkina 5. Thanks to episode 9, we now know that Ruescott eventually finds his way to the rebel base on Yavin, where presumably Vel recognized the gun from when Cassian used it in the Aldhani mission. Incredible!</p><p>But somehow the best detail draws on an even more subtle throughline. While <em>Andor </em>viewers have watched Syril obsessively hunt Cassian and other “outside agitators” because of some pathological need to assert law and order, Cassian has no real idea who he even is, culminating in an exasperated “Who are you?”  that stops Syril dead in his tracks when the two finally throw down during the Ghorman Massacre. The “didn’t catch a name” from back on Aldhani hits even harder in that context, and Syril’s blaster unexpectedly ends up acting like a sort of breadcrumb trail leading us back to it. </p><p>Callbacks like this rarely net such a payoff, especially in the blockbuster IP franchises we’re now surrounded by. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/star-wars-easter-eggs-andor-season-2-first-3-episodes-1851777501&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/star-wars-easter-eggs-andor-season-2-first-3-episodes-1851777501">Most easter eggs</a></span> these days amount to simple name dropping so that anyone not in the know has to go Google what was going on until they eventually end up on a for-profit wiki so loaded up with auto-play ads and pop-ups that it crashes their browser. This is why I’ve generally defaulted to rolling my eyes at cheap lore deepcuts meant to earn credibility without actually doing the work, and why<em> Andor</em> is such a breath of fresh Chandrila air. </p><p>The show did the same thing with a moment in <em>Rogue One</em>, which all of <em>Andor</em> is leading up to, when Cassian tells Jyn Erso that “rebellions are built on hope,” a line she later repeats as the sentiment begins to take hold. Showrunner Tony Gilroy said he <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://ew.com/andor-creator-mocked-by-son-not-including-famous-rogue-one-line-11730406&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://ew.com/andor-creator-mocked-by-son-not-including-famous-rogue-one-line-11730406" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">was bullied by his son</a></span> into giving the quote an origin story in <em>Andor</em>, which is why the Ghorman bellhop ends up saying it to Cassian right before the fighting breaks out. That hope culminates in a bomb he lobs to give Ghorman’s freedom fighters a route to escape. So much of modern <em>Star Wars</em> is slavishly devoted to stale canon for no reason. <em>Andor</em> is the rare exception. </p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
