Folks craft celebrity lookalikes, themselves, and their ideal vision of the perfect hero. Personally, I’m in and out in five minutes, ready to play. But what happens if you speed through that process with your character and then find it’s subpar in gameplay? Fortunately, <em>Monster Hunter Wilds</em> won’t shoulder you with buyer’s remorse given its various settings for tweaking your character’s style.</p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="196742" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="What Is Dragonsplague?

It’s been like this for a few years, longer if you ask some people, and it doesn’t seem to be getting better anytime soon. Thankfully, <em>Spilled </em>is here. It’s a new game about a tiny boat cleaning up a big mess that at least lets us fix a digital world. </p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="197298" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="Live Forever in the Universe of 'New World: Aeternum'" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="108" data-playlist="197298,197284,197260" data-current="197298"><div><p>Live Forever in the Universe of 'New World: Aeternum'</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197298/197298_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197298/197298_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197298/197298_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197298/197298_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"></video></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://store.steampowered.com/app/2240080/Spilled/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2240080/Spilled/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>Spilled</em>, out today on PC</a></span>, is the first indie game from developer Lente. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://x.com/LenteGameDev/status/1897575001106022591&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://x.com/LenteGameDev/status/1897575001106022591" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">She lives on a boat, and this is her first release on Steam</a></span>. And in Lente’s <em>Spilled</em>, you are given the role of a sleepy little boat, tasked with cleaning up a gorgeous pixel art world using an upgradeable vacuum, water cannon, and crane. Some nasty, evil boats have been putting around and leaving black goo everywhere across various biomes and its up to you to save the day by collecting all the goo and recycling it into coins—coins that can then be used to upgrade your boat. </p><p>It’s a fairly simple concept, perfectly nailed in <em>Spilled</em>. Controlling the boat feels good and upgrading its engine to make it faster feels even better. Early on, the goo you encounter is in small patches and easy to suck up. But later on, the spills of goo you find are massive and you’ll need to go back and forth through the messes to effectively clean them. And doing this is immensely satisfying, like perfectly removing the sudsy water from a car windshield using a squeegee. Clean up an area enough  and sea critters, like whales and dolphins, will return and the water will turn blue again. </p><p><em>Spilled </em>will take most players about an hour or so to finish. Though if you want to clean every inch of its cozy world and collect all the hidden animals, you’ll likely need to spend about two hours total. It’s short, but its also packed with a lot of ideas. Every 10 minutes or so, <em>Spilled </em>was either teaching me a new way to clean stuff up—like using a water canon to remove hard-to-reach gunk on rocks—or letting me upgrade my boat again.</p><p> I’d love to see a sequel to <em>Spilled </em>that adds more levels, more ways to clean stuff up, and maybe even co-op. But for now, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/best-cozy-games-disney-dreamlight-valley-chill-relaxing-1848255535&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/best-cozy-games-disney-dreamlight-valley-chill-relaxing-1848255535"><em>Spilled</em> is a solid and gentle indie game</a></span> that lets me clean up the world for an hour, and that’s nice. I really like that. </p><p> .<br></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

The 2026 film is the next big crossover in the Marvel Cinematic Universe and will also bring Iron Man actor Robert Downey Jr. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/robert-downey-jr-rdj-doctor-doom-avengers-marvel-sdcc-1851607689&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/robert-downey-jr-rdj-doctor-doom-avengers-marvel-sdcc-1851607689">back into the fold as Doctor Doom</a></span>. But now we’re getting a long, drawn-out cast announcement confirming which MCU heroes will be facing off against Doctor Doom next year.</p><p>The stream is lingering on shots of director’s chairs featuring different actors’ names on them. The first one was Thor actor <strong>Chris Hemsworth</strong>, who was last seen in <em>Thor: Love and Thunder </em>in 2022. After several minutes of hanging out on his chair, the camera panned right to reveal a chair with <strong>Vanessa Kirby’s</strong> name printed on it. Kirby is playing Sue “Invisible Woman” Storm in <em>Fantastic Four: First Steps, </em>which will premiere on July 25. However, she was <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://deadline.com/2024/07/the-fantastic-four-first-steps-marvel-comic-con-1236021939/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://deadline.com/2024/07/the-fantastic-four-first-steps-marvel-comic-con-1236021939/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">already confirmed for the film last year</a></span>, so that’s not new. Third up is <strong>Anthony Mackie</strong>, the new Captain America, who just starred in <em>Captain America: Brave New World</em> in February. Fourth revealed is <strong>Sebastian Stan</strong>, who plays the Winter Soldier, and will star in <em>Thunderbolts* </em>on May 2.</p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="197298" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="Live Forever in the Universe of 'New World: Aeternum'" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="108" data-playlist="197298,197284,197260" data-current="197298"><div><p>Live Forever in the Universe of 'New World: Aeternum'</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197298/197298_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197298/197298_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197298/197298_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197298/197298_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"></video></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>Next is <strong>Letitia Wright</strong>, who plays Shuri, the new Black Panther who took on the title in <em>Black Panther: Wakanda Forever</em>. <strong>Paul Rudd </strong>got a tiny chair because he’s Ant-Man who can become a little guy. The camera panned back up to normal human-sized chairs, revealing <strong>Wyatt Russell </strong>will return as U.S. Agent after reprising the role in <em>Thunderbolts*</em>. <strong>Tenoch Huerta Mejía </strong>will return as Namor after playing the sea-faring villain in <em>Black Panther: Wakanda Forever</em>. <strong>Ebon Moss-Bachrach </strong>is the second of the Fantastic Four to join the cast after portraying the Thing in <em>First Steps</em>. <strong>Simu Liu </strong>will reprise his role as Shangi-Chi, which I’m sure he’s happy about considering the martial arts movie’s sequel has been pushed down the assembly line after director Destin Daniel Cretton was moved onto the next <em>Spider-Man </em>movie. <strong>Florence Pugh </strong>will return as Yelena, another one of the <em>Thunderbolts* </em>crew.</p><p>That’s all we’ve seen thus far. I mean, I guess if you want to keep something in the conversation all day, one way to do that is to drag an announcement out for hours. It seems like they’re revealing a new cast member roughly every 10 minutes. Right now, there haven’t been any surprises, so hopefully, there will be someone unexpected at some point to make these theatrics worthwhile.
