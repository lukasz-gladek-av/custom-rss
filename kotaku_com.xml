              <p>Massive game install sizes and the diminishing role of physical media continue to be frustrating. This time around, <i>Final Fantasy VII Remake</i>’s Switch 2 “physical version” is in the crosshairs. A “Game-Key Card,” <i>Remake</i>’s physical Switch 2 release contains no data itself but will initiate a massive download that’ll Kirby up a ton of the Switch 2’s otherwise generous built-in storage capacity.</p> <p>Despite having a pretty-looking case design, <i>FF7R</i> will ship on Switch 2 with a card that merely serves as a physical license to download a whopping 90GB (<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/final-fantasy-7-remake-on-switch-2-is-a-game-key-card-thatll-fill-a-third-of-your-consoles-storage-space">h/t <i>Eurogamer</i></a>), which is around a third of the spacious (or so we thought) 256GB storage capacity of the Switch 2. But as Switch 2 connoisseurs will point out, Square Enix probably didn’t have much choice. The maximum size of an actual physical Switch 2 game is only 64GB. While file compression can work wonders, <i>FF7R</i> with its <i>Intergrade</i> expansion is just too damn big to fit on a cart.</p> <p>As our comrades at <i>Eurogamer</i> wonder, however, is this Nintendo’s fault for “not offering larger game cards?”</p>

After all, the Switch 2 is clearly making a play to be the premiere place to go for AAA experiences on handhelds–and it’s got the horsepower to do it, as we’ve seen with <a href="https://kotaku.com/star-wars-outlaws-switch-2-port-patch-is-it-good-2000624465"><i>Star Wars Outlaws</i></a> and even <i>Cyberpunk 2077</i>.</p> <p>At the time of this writing, one can buy a 256GB SD card for peanuts (if peanuts is just $25 to you), so why are the Switch 2’s carts limited to just 64GB? It feels like an arbitrary decision that, if Nintendo was invested in physical media and the ability to play a game on a dedicated <i>handheld </i>device without any internet connection whatsoever, it would have made efforts to solve–especially for ambitious (and very good!) games like <i>FF7R</i>.</p> <p>And let’s be honest, 90GB isn’t uniquely large when it comes to AAA games. It’s early days for the Switch 2, so what’s this problem gonna look like as games only continue to bloom in size?</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><span>There were plenty of really exciting announcements about </span><i><span>Pokémon Legends: Z-A </span></i><span>during </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/nintendo-direct-september-2025-switch-2-mario-yoshi-pokemon-2000625264"><span>last week’s Nintendo Direct</span></a><span>, with fans especially thrilled that several Pokémon who probably should’ve gotten Mega Evolutions a decade ago would finally get them in the upcoming RPG. The </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-legends-za-mega-evolution-greninja-delphox-2000625428"><span>Kalos starters</span></a><span> and the big mouse himself, </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-legends-z-a-mega-raichu-evolution-x-y-paid-dlc-2000625371"><span>Raichu</span></a><span>, are all getting these beefed-up transformations in </span><i><span>Legends: Z-A</span></i><span> after they were each snubbed when </span><i><span>X </span></i><span>and </span><i><span>Y </span></i><span>first introduced the mechanic back in 2013. However, the excitement has quickly been replaced with annoyance, as each of these new forms has both paid and skill-based gates put on them, and the base game isn’t even out yet.</span></p> <p><span>Let’s start with the most straightforward one. Mega Raichu X and Y are part of </span><i><span>Legends: Z-A</span></i><span>’s $30 </span><i><span>Mega Dimension </span></i><span>DLC. This is a post-game story expansion that will introduce both Raichu Mega forms and involve Hoopa, the dimension-jumping mythical Pokémon, who is apparently opening up new dimensional rifts throughout Lumiose City. Paid DLC for </span><i><span>Pokémon </span></i><span>games isn’t new, as both </span><i><span>Sword </span></i><span>and </span><i><span>Shield </span></i><span>and </span><i><span>Scarlet </span></i><span>and </span><i><span>Violet</span></i><span> had them, but they weren’t announced until some time after the games launched.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>There has been some misinformation spreading, suggesting that </span><i><span>Mega Dimension </span></i><span>is a day-one DLC and that the new story content is ready to go and is being deliberately separated from the main game to squeeze out an extra $30 from fans, but that’s not entirely accurate. </span><i><span>Mega Dimension </span></i><span>is listed on the </span><a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/store/products/pokemon-legends-z-a-mega-dimension-dlc-70070000030771-switch/?srsltid=AfmBOopuIYK4FTjTcy2lS9oLVoAa_S4T9XoZ_tFt28QTadILnkf_lQnw"><span>eShop</span></a><span> as having the same October 16 release date as </span><i><span>Legends: Z-A</span></i><span>, but this is because buying the DLC grants you immediate access to a set of costumes, while the story content, and Mega Raichu X and Y, will be out “by February 28th, 2026.” Nevertheless, </span><i><span>Mega Dimension </span></i><span>raises the cost of </span><i><span>Legends: Z-A</span></i><span>’s set of new Mega Evolutions to $100 total if you’re buying the game on Nintendo Switch 2, as the game itself is $70.</span></p>

 <p><span>“Paid DLC for a 70$ game that’s not even out yet.. Are you fucking kidding me…</span><i><span>Silksong</span></i><span> is 20 dollars btw,” a user on </span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/pokemon/comments/1nf3x6g/mega_dimension_is_paid_dlc_for_pokemon_legends_za/"><span>Reddit</span></a><span> wrote in response to the announcement.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>“I missed when </span><i><span>Pokémon</span></i><span> was a full game,” another user replied. “Well into the era of scam DLCs they made full games. Even </span><i><span>Legends Arceus</span></i><span> is [a] post-pandemic full game. Sad to see them doing this shit, and this direction has me reconsidering a purchase of </span><i><span>Z-A</span></i><span>.”</span></p>   <p><span>DLC isn’t new, though, so there’s some precedent for Mega Raichu and any others added in </span><i><span>Mega Dimensions </span></i><span>that might be unveiled between now and launch to be gated behind a paywall. The Kalos starter Mega Evolutions, however, are adding a new wrinkle to completing the Pokedex that is gated behind both an additional cost and a gameplay skill check. In order to get Mega Chesnaught, Delphox, and Greninja, you’ll have to rise up the ranks in online battles, and that means you not only have to play online, but you have to win against other players. The first rub of this is that it’s another pay gate, as you’ll have to pay for an online subscription to play against other trainers through the internet. It will require at least a few months of subscribing to get all three, as each is being given out as a seasonal reward, though we don’t know how long each season will last yet. A Nintendo Online membership costs at least $3.99 a month, so you likely won’t be able to get all the Mega Evolutions the game has to offer without also spending at least $12 on a subscription.</span></p>

 <p><span>After you’ve paid to play online, you’ll actually have to defeat other players, meaning that if you’re not a skilled competitive player who is looking to get sweaty in ranked matches, you could very well not get the Mega Stones you’re paying for. This also means you won’t be able to have any of these forms on your team during your first playthrough, which is a real bummer for folks who want to have these guys by their side as they see </span><i><span>Legends: Z-A</span></i><span>’s story through.</span></p> <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">I’m actually pissed the Kalos Starters Megas are locked behind Ranked Matches.

If you’re playing the game on the original Switch, that total will be 10 dollars lower as the game itself only costs $60 on older hardware. But wowza, that’s a lot of money to be asking for when the game isn’t even out yet. That’s nearly the price of two full-priced games, which is typically what The Pokémon Company asks for when it puts out each new pair of games each generation. Maybe this is the company’s way of making up for taking a year off from a mainline RPG or DLC in 2024, or perhaps The Pokémon Company has the type of greed they talk about in the Bible. One way or another, completing </span><i><span>Legends: Z-A </span></i><span>just got much more expensive after one Nintendo Direct, and that’s not the vibe Game Freak or The Pokémon Company probably wants with the game just a month away from launch on October 16.</span></p>

            <title><![CDATA[Balatro’s Biggest Update Yet Is Taking Longer Than Expected]]></title>
            <link>https://kotaku.com/balatro-localthunk-1-1-update-delay-2025-game-development-2000625702</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/balatro%E2%80%99s-biggest-update-yet-is-taking-longer-than-expected.1298202/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>The boundary between hobbyist and professional is a tricky one–especially in creative fields. In balancing the demands of work and creative joy, LocalThunk, lone developer of 2024’s smash hit roguelike poker game <i>Balatro</i>, has announced that the anticipated 1.1 update won’t arrive this year.</p> <p>“I am working slowly,” LocalThunk said <a href="https://localthunk.com/blog/im-slow">in a blog post apologizing for the delayed update</a>, “but I like it that way.” The solo dev shared that, upon reflection, he “probably shouldn’t have announced any date for the 1.1 update at all,” stating that he “took a break from everything to do with the game for a few months until the start of 2025.” In the post, LocalThunk does as much as possible to assure folks that he ‘s committed to producing more <i>Balatro</i> in the future, but hitting a 2025 deadline for the update interfered with what he thinks is “the best version of ‘work,’” which is an approach that avoids burnout and “makes me want to come back to my keyboard every day, healthy, and hopefully just as excited about game development five years from now as I am today.” He added, “I don’t want 1.1 to be the last update this game gets.”</p> <p>LocalThunk did not share a timeline for when to expect the update, simply stating, “It’s done when it’s done.”</p>

 <p>That sounds ominous, but don’t fret. In the same post, LocalThunk shares that not only is he still “drawing my silly jokers” in a “notebook that is now teeming with ideas to implement or test in the game,” but that after finally unlocking all achievements in the game, “the <i>Balatro</i> player in me will absolutely not allow me to walk away from developing this game.”</p> <p>Rather than complaining about the delay, some fans of <i>Balatro</i> have <a href="https://x.com/magnum_d1ngus/status/1966540519703449974">shared positive</a> <a href="https://x.com/CRABnightt/status/1966527713344119110">sentiments</a> regarding the wait. “Take your time. <i>Balatro</i> is great 💜” <a href="https://x.com/butterhoops/status/1966507827670720646">reads one reply on X</a>. “The only reason people are as excited as they are for 1.1 is because you had the chance to take your time when working on <i>Balatro</i>,” <a href="https://x.com/magnum_d1ngus/status/1966540519703449974">reads another</a>.</p> <p><i>Balatro</i> was a hit last year, so it’s no surprise that folks are hungry for more. Still, it’s nice to see folks extending some grace, encouraging a dev to take their time to appropriately channel their creative energies into something meaningful and not rushed.</p>
