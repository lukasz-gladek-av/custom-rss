              <p>We might not be getting <a href="https://kotaku.com/magic-not-planning-harry-potter-crossover-despite-parent-company-announcing-major-deal-2000667292"><em>Harry</em> <em>Potter</em>-themed<em> Magic: The Gathering</em></a> cards anytime soon, but Hasbro is still finding plenty of other franchises to pump into its money-printing furnace. If you want to play FromSoftware’s next game, you’re gonna need a Switch 2. And is the next <em>Metro</em> game coming later this year?</p> <p>It’s the latest edition of Morning Checkpoint, <em>Kotaku</em>‘s daily roundup of gaming news, rumors, and culture. What’s on your <a href="https://x.com/mrpyo1/status/2021612609049395289">fake PlayStation State of Play leak wishlist</a>? For me it’s an <em>Armored Core 6</em> expansion or, better yet, an entirely new standalone game.</p>

 <h2><em>Magic: The Gathering</em> makes so much god damn money</h2> <p>Parent company Hasbro <a href="https://investor.hasbro.com/news-releases/news-release-details/hasbro-reports-fourth-quarter-and-full-year-2025-financial">revealed in its earnings this week</a> that<em> Magic: The Gathering</em> raked in $1.7 billion in revenue in 2025. That was up 59 percent from the year prior, much of it on the back of the fastest-selling set it’s ever produced: <em>Final Fantasy Universes Beyond</em>. Hasbro is sitting on a golden goose that shits cardboard, even if some investors are currently suing the company for <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/card-games/hasbro-is-being-sued-by-its-own-shareholders-for-printing-so-many-damn-magic-cards-destroying-the-long-term-value-of-the-brand/">allegedly mishandling that asset by printing too many cards</a>.</p> <p><em>MTG</em> might be as overexposed as Timothée Chalamet but it is currently paying huge dividends to Hasbro’s shareholders. With new Marvel, <em>Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles</em>, and <em>Star Trek</em> sets all planned for the coming year, the toy maker is already promising $1 billion in stock buybacks. Don’t think of it as the Wall Street equivalent of milling your deck for short-term advantage, think of it more as exiling equity for a rainy day.</p>

 <h2><em>The Duskbloods</em> isn’t coming to PC</h2> <p>FromSoftware parent company Kadokawa also released <a href="https://ssl4.eir-parts.net/doc/9468/ir_material_for_fiscal_ym13/198090/00.pdf">its earnings this week</a> in which it confirmed <em>Elden Ring</em> and<em> The Duskbloods</em> are still both set to come to Switch 2 in 2026. There’s no firm release dates yet, but <em>The Duskbloods</em> in particular “will only be available for the Nintendo Switch 2,” suggesting no timed exclusivity or parallel launch on PC.</p>

 <h2>Embracer teases a “long-awaited, major” game coming soon</h2> <p>Guess who else was doing earnings this week? The once-almighty investment vehicle/game-publishing conglomerate Embracer got people talking with its remarks to investors. “For the next financial year, we look forward to one long-awaited, major, in-house-developed and in-house-published title together with a range of important mid-sized titles,” the company said (via <em><a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/metro-and-darksiders-owner-embracer-says-it-will-soon-release-a-long-awaited-major-game/">VGC</a></em>). That points to 4A Game’s new shooter in the post-apocalyptic <em>Metro</em> series. Embracer also owns Gunfire Games, which is working on <em>Darksiders 4</em>, but that sounds like it’s farther tout.</p> <h2><em>Battlefield 6</em>‘s season 2 trailer is finally here</h2>  <p>Alongside the <a href="https://www.resetera.com/threads/battlefield-6-season-2-gameplay-trailer-and-roadmap-2-maps-new-vehicles-and-weapons-limited-time-night-modes-etc.1433695/">updated roadmap</a>, it outlines new maps, modes, and gear coming to the game starting February 17. Will two new maps per season be enough to keep players satiated? Not if they’re not big enough, and the bigger ones sound like they’re still a few months away.</p>

 <h2><em>Assassin’s Creed IV: Black Flag Remastered</em> is still out there, lurking</h2> <p>Ubisoft’s worst-kept secret just had its art book <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GamingLeaksAndRumours/comments/1r26nu9/assassins_creed_black_flag_remaster_art_book/">listed on Amazon</a>. The game was originally rumored to be coming this winter but now appears to have been delayed ahead of Ubisoft’s recent poor earnings report.</p> <div> <h2>The <em>Arc Raiders</em> domination train hasn’t lost steam</h2> <p>For every half-dozen live service stumbles, you get a durable new hit or two, and <em>Arc Raiders</em> is one of them. Publisher Nexon <a href="https://pdf.irpocket.com/C3659/YpwX/MxJ9/q7uK.pdf">revealed this week</a> that the game has sold 14 million copies so far, and reached nearly 1 million peak concurrent players across all platforms in January. Months after launch it’s still reportedly sustaining 6 million weekly active users. Those are MMO numbers, which is maybe why Embark Studios CEO Patrick Soderland recently <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-big-arc-raiders-interview-embark-boss-patrick-sderlund-talks-live-service-plans-banning-cheaters-and-the-secret-sauce-of-pve">told <em>IGN</em></a> he feels the extraction shooter needs more social hubs that are better utilized.</p> </div> <h2>ICYMI:</h2> <ul> <li><strong><a href="https://kotaku.com/reanimal-review-little-nightmares-3-horror-adventure-2000667716"><em>Reanimal</em> is a beautiful but disappointing successor to <em>Little Nightmares</em>&nbsp;</a></strong></li> <li><strong><a href="https://kotaku.com/overwatch-new-heroes-story-sigma-dialogue-sombra-talon-2000667771"><em>Overwatch</em> has come roaring back after lapsed players realize it’s good again</a></strong></li> <li><strong><a href="https://kotaku.com/diablo-2-resurrected-reign-of-the-warlock-new-class-2000667816"><em>Diablo 2</em> is getting a big new expansion like it’s 2000 all over again</a></strong></li> </ul> <h2>Watch this:</h2>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>A new report claims that following high-profile examples of rich people being killed or robbed, the wealthy elite are more nervous than ever about poor people or criminals robbing them, or worse. To defend against this, many are turning their multi-million dollar mansions into spaces that closely resemble <em>Hitman</em> levels.</p> <p><a href="https://www.wsj.com/real-estate/luxury-homes/luxury-home-security-aca080d7">A new <em>Wall Street Journal</em> report</a> shows that a lot of the richest people in the United States are on edge after events like the <a href="https://www.rollingstone.com/culture/rs-gaming/among-us-luigi-mangione-unitedhealthcare-murder-1235199846/">assassination of UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson</a> in New York City in 2024 and the shooting of Blackstone executive Wesley LePatner and others in 2025. There have also been some high-profile burglaries, including the homes of Brad Pitt, Nicole Kidman, and Kansas City Chiefs star QB Patrick Mahomes. Reportedly many rich celebs and executives are also nervous about sites that <a href="https://kotaku.com/half-life-3-leak-sgf-2025-rumor-gabe-newell-yacht-1851783832">let people track private jets and yachts</a>. To ease their fears, many of the richest people around are spending millions on adding security features like laser grids, moats, armed guards, and AI-powered cameras to their mansions.</p>

 <p>“Prior to the wide use of social media, most CEOs—whether they’re in private equity, finance or tech—no one knew their names or what they looked like, with few exceptions,” said Miami luxury real estate agent Danny Hertzberg. “Now, people are tracking them.”</p> <p>One former tech mogul turned real estate agent showed off a $15 million mansion compound in Arizona that included 32 “casino-grade cameras” and a “laser intrusion detection system” around the home’s large perimeter. The house’s front door is made out of three-inch-thick solid steel and includes 13 deadbolts. Around the house are also sour orange trees with four-inch spikes intended to deter people from sneaking around. And in front of all that is a moat. Meanwhile, inside the house is a reinforced concrete bunker with a 2,000-pound door and an air filtration system built to extremely high standards.</p>

 <p>And this is far from the only mansion being turned into a challenging <em>Hitman</em> level. <em>The Wall Street Journal</em> says roughly 45 percent of high-end homes sold last year included a reference to privacy or security. That’s up from 38 percent in 2024.</p>

 <p>In Vegas, a luxury design firm says clients are now spending $100,000 to $1.5 million just on security features like safe rooms and cameras. In Florida, another building company is working to incorporate biometric access, facial recognition, and iris scanning into its security systems.</p> <p>Meanwhile, in places like Beverly Hills, developers are contracting security firm Arsec Group to provide 24/7 armed guard for their latest collection of high-end homes inside a gated community. Mikey Arana, founder of Arsec, says many of his clients in California are increasingly worried about being followed and robbed after a night out on the town wearing pricey clothes and jewelry. &nbsp;The armed guards carry 9mm pistols and observe the property via infrared cameras.</p>

 <p>“Sometimes, unfortunately, the only way to stop violent action is with a violent response,” said Arana.</p>

              <p>We first learned that the frosty survival game <em>The Long Dark&nbsp;</em>was getting a sequel <a href="https://kotaku.com/game-awards-2024-trailers-announcements-world-premieres-1851720032/24">during 2024’s Game Awards</a>. Called&nbsp;<em>Blackfrost: The Long Dark 2</em>, the follow-up to 2017’s excellent first-person game about surviving in the Canadian wilderness was said to be coming to early access in 2026. That’s no longer the case, with developer Hinterland’s founder Raphael van Lierop now saying it won’t be out in any form this year, and as a consequence 10 full-time developers and four contractors from the studio are being let go.</p> <p>“I’m sad to share the news that I’ve made the difficult decision today to part ways with 10 of our cherished colleagues,” begins a statement from van Lierop <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/rvanlierop_some-very-sad-news-from-hinterland-today-share-7427536054947045376-f305/">posted to LinkedIn</a> (thanks&nbsp;<a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/hinterland-confirms-layoffs-after-delaying-the-long-dark-sequel"><em>Game Developer</em></a>). “We also will not extend some existing fixed-term contracts when they expire, impacting another 4 team members, bringing the total affected to 14.”</p>

 <p>The reasons given allude to wider industry issues, but suggest the primary issue is that <em>Blackfrost</em> won’t be in a state to enter early access this year, which van Lierop says “means pushing significant expected revenue out as well, and these layoffs will help us preserve the financial resources required to get the game to launch, as well as to continue supporting our other games.”</p> <figure id="attachment_2000668230" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000668230"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000668230">© Hinterland / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p>The original&nbsp;<em>The Long Dark</em> was first released in its earliest form in 2014, following a successful Kickstarter the previous year. One of the rare examples of a truly purposeful early access development, the shiver-inducing first-person survival sim then released regular significant updates, each developing its core ideas in new and interesting directions, until its splendid 2017 final version. And all of them ensured you were always likely <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-long-dark-impres-oh-ive-been-eaten-by-a-wolf">to be eaten by a wolf</a>. Its only stumble was the initial addition of its Wintermute story mode, the first two of the five chapters failing to win many over, but even these were later recreated in a far better form. Astonishingly, the fifth chapter still isn’t out, <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/305620/view/582781208710089005?l=english">last said to be arriving on March 31, 2026</a>, and van Lierop says the new layoffs will not affect its release. Planned updates for the original game that are scheduled to appear this year are also apparently unaffected.</p>

 <p>“This is a heavy, heavy day for Hinterland,” says the CEO, “and our hearts are with all those affected by today’s layoff. I’m sorry to have had to let these people go.” The statement says efforts have been made to help those affected find new work, adding, “Any development studio in the industry would be fortunate to have any single one of these team members. We are a weaker studio for losing them, and they will be sorely missed.”</p>

 <p>Being a weaker studio will surely further hinder development of <em>Blackfrost</em>, not least given the intention was never to release a finished game this year, but rather its earliest playable version. Hopefully some additional money will come in to Hinterland with today’s news that the original <em>The Long Dark</em> is finally returning to GOG, after <a href="https://www.gog.com/forum/general/the_long_dark_removal/page1">being mysteriously pulled from the store in 2018</a>. It’s <a href="https://www.gog.com/en/game/the_long_dark">on the freshly independent PC gaming store with a 25-percent discount for the next week</a>.</p>
