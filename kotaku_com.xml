However, perhaps you’re wondering if the game is on Steam? Or if you can play it with a friend via co-op? Or maybe you just want to know how much space it will take up on your Xbox’s SSD? </p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="195301" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="This Brutal Gothic Metroidvania Is Shaping up To Be Something Special" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="111" data-playlist="195301,196358,196215" data-current="195301"><div><p>This Brutal Gothic Metroidvania Is Shaping up To Be Something Special</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195301/195301_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195301/195301_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195301/195301_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195301/195301_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/20762.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>Well, all those questions and many more are answered below! </p><hr><h2 id="h2242028"><a id=""></a><strong>When Can I play <em>Avowed</em>?</strong></h2><p><em> Avowed </em>is out now! It first released via a five-day early access period for those who pre-ordered the premium edition. But that ended on February 18. </p><h2 id="h2242029"><a id=""></a><strong>Where can I play <em>Avowed</em>? </strong></h2><p><em>Avowed </em>is out now on PC and Xbox Series X/S.</p><h2 id="h2242030"><a id=""></a><strong>Is <em>Avowed </em>On PS5?</strong></h2><p>Nope! But I’d bet a dollar that it will arrive on PS5 in the future. Obsidian’s next RPG, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.gematsu.com/2024/12/the-outer-worlds-2-adds-ps5-version-launches-in-2025&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/2024/12/the-outer-worlds-2-adds-ps5-version-launches-in-2025" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>The Outer Worlds 2</em>, is coming to PS5 in 2025</a></span>. And Xbox is bringing many of its <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/xbox-ceo-phil-spencer-console-wars-over-ps5-switch-era-1851765304&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/xbox-ceo-phil-spencer-console-wars-over-ps5-switch-era-1851765304">old and new games to PS5</a></span>. So <em>Avowed </em>will likely arrive on Sony’s console one day.</p><h2 id="h2242031"><a id=""></a><strong>Will <em>Avowed </em>be on Switch 2? </strong></h2><p>No port has been announced. But if the Switch 2 can run it, I’d expect Xbox will bring it to the Nintendo’s next-gen machine in the future alongside a PS5 port, too. </p><h2 id="h2242032"><a id=""></a><strong>Is it on Game Pass? </strong></h2><p>Yup! <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/avowed-companion-barks-battles-obsidian-xbox-1851764675&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/avowed-companion-barks-battles-obsidian-xbox-1851764675"><em>Avowed</em></a></span><em> </em>is available to play via Game Pass Ultimate or Game Pass PC. </p><h2 id="h2242033"><a id=""></a><strong>Is <em>Avowed </em>On Steam? </strong></h2><p>Yes. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://store.steampowered.com/app/2457220/Avowed/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2457220/Avowed/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>Avowed </em>is on Valve’s popular digital storefront</a></span>. And you don’t need to install a seperate launcher or link your Xbox account to play it. </p><h2 id="h2242034"><a id=""></a><strong>Can I play it on Steam Deck? </strong></h2><p>Yes... <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.pcgamer.com/games/rpg/avowed-may-run-on-a-9-year-old-gpu-but-steam-deck-looks-like-a-no-go-unless-you-like-sub-30fps-upscaled-at-minimum-settings/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/rpg/avowed-may-run-on-a-9-year-old-gpu-but-steam-deck-looks-like-a-no-go-unless-you-like-sub-30fps-upscaled-at-minimum-settings/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">but be prepared for rocky performance and some major quality issues</a></span>. </p><p>Really, I’d avoid playing <em>Avowed </em>on Steam Deck. If you want to play the game on the go, you might be better off streaming it on your phone via Xbox Game Pass Cloud. </p><h2 id="h2242035"><a id=""></a><strong>Does <em>Avowed </em>support cross-save and cross-buy? </strong></h2><p>Yes! <em>Avowed </em>is an Xbox Play Anywhere game, which means you can hop between your Xbox and your PC freely, assuming your PC can run the game. The Steam version even supports Xbox cloud saves, too. </p><h2 id="h2242036"><a id=""></a><strong>How much space does <em>Avowed </em>take up?</strong></h2><p>75 GB on Xbox Series X/S. About 72 GB on PC. </p><h2 id="h2242037"><a id=""></a><strong>Does it support 60FPS on Xbox? </strong></h2><p>Yes! <em>Avowed</em> includes a performance mode that lets you play the game at 60FPS. However, this is only available on Xbox Series X and not the smaller, cheaper S console. The game also has a 30FPS mode and a 40FPS option that works with 120hz TVs. </p><h2 id="h2242038"><a id=""></a><strong>How long is <em>Avowed?</em></strong></h2><p><em>Avowed </em>will take most players about 30 to 40 hours. I was able to complete most side quests and finish all of the main quests in about 36 hours, though I was rushing to reach the end as I got closer to the finale. </p><p>If you take your time, explore each map completely, and do everything, you can easily spend over 50 hours in <em>Avowed</em>. </p><h2 id="h2242039"><a id=""></a><strong>Can you keep playing after you finish the last quest?</strong></h2><p>No! Once you reach the final big questline of the game, you are warned that there is no going back from that point. So if you want to do everything, you’ll need to save before starting the last quest and load that up later to go back and explore the world fully. Or you can just avoid the final quest while you do other things. </p><h2 id="h2242040"><a id=""></a><strong>Is <em>Avowed </em>an open-world game? </strong></h2><p>Yes, but it’s broken up into separate maps that you can explore freely as you progress through the game. </p><h2 id="h2242041"><a id=""></a><strong>Does it have co-op?</strong></h2><p>No. There is no multiplayer in <em>Avowed</em>. </p><h2 id="h2242042"><a id=""></a><strong>Can I switch from first-person to third-person?</strong></h2><p>Yup! It’s in the settings. </p><figure id="" data-id="957254442debe30537079d85b5fda23e" data-recommend-id="image://957254442debe30537079d85b5fda23e" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Xbox / Obsidian / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="957254442debe30537079d85b5fda23e" data-recommend-id="image://957254442debe30537079d85b5fda23e" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><h2 id="h2242043"><a id=""></a><strong>Is Garrus from <em>Mass Effect</em> in Avowed? </strong></h2><p>No, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/avowed-kai-mass-effect-garrus-voice-brandon-keener-1851765192&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/avowed-kai-mass-effect-garrus-voice-brandon-keener-1851765192">but his voice actor, Brandon Keener, is</a></span>, and as a result Kai is the best character in the game. </p><h2 id="h2242044"><a id=""></a><strong>Do I need to play<em> Pillars of Eternity</em> first?</strong></h2><p>Nope. However, if you do play <em>Pillars of Eternity </em>(and its sequel, <em>Deadfire</em>) first, you’ll likely pick up on the lore faster. I never played those games and within a few hours I was fully immersed in <em>Avowed </em>and its worldbuilding. </p><h2 id="h2242045"><a id=""></a><strong>Are there multiple endings?</strong></h2><p>Oh yeah. There are a lot of ways to save or control the Living Lands. </p><h2 id="h2242046"><a id=""></a><strong>Will there be any DLC for <em>Avowed</em>?</strong></h2><p>Maybe. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.gamesradar.com/games/rpg/avowed-director-confirms-the-game-follows-the-outer-worlds-lead-to-skip-new-game-plus-but-dlc-is-still-a-maybe/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/rpg/avowed-director-confirms-the-game-follows-the-outer-worlds-lead-to-skip-new-game-plus-but-dlc-is-still-a-maybe/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">That’s the official answer from Obsidian Entertainment</a></span>, the studio behind <em>Avowed</em>. Considering the team’s last few games got DLC, I’d expect some kind of expansion is in the works. For now, however, we don’t know. </p><h2 id="h2242047"><a id=""></a><strong>Is <em>Avowed </em>any good?</strong></h2><p>It’s really really really good! <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/avowed-xbox-pc-rpg-game-pass-skyrim-review-kotaku-1851761525&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/avowed-xbox-pc-rpg-game-pass-skyrim-review-kotaku-1851761525">You should read our review to find out more</a></span>.</p><h2 id="h2242048"><a id=""></a><strong>Do you have any <em>Avowed </em>tips? </strong></h2><p>Yup! <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/xbox-game-pass-avowed-rpg-tips-tricks-before-you-play-1851760887&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/xbox-game-pass-avowed-rpg-tips-tricks-before-you-play-1851760887">Click here</a></span> for plenty of non-spoilery tips! </p><h2 id="h2242049"><a id=""></a><strong>Can I punch a bear in this game? </strong></h2><p>Uh...okay, I’m going to end this here, but yes, you can do that. Not sure why you asked, but there you go. Bye. </p><p>&nbsp; .<br></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
