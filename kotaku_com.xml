Some armors require unique materials to be forged. Anyone who has a history with the series likely remembers one such material, the ominously named “Sinister Cloth,” which tasks you with laborious methods of acquiring it. While it remains a pain in <em>Wilds</em>, there some best options to follow to start snagging some of your own. </p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="196742" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="What Is Dragonsplague?

And whether Link’s first truly open-world game is calling to you for the first time, or you’re a returning veteran looking to re-explore Hyrule once again (with improved visuals and performance)there’s a substantial amount of content here. If you want to put a number to things, though, that’s going to be a bit complicated.

Doing so can <strong>stretch the game’s length to a staggering 150-200 hours</strong>. Yeah, it’s a lot. But there’s more.</p><p>If you want to complete literally everything in <strong><em>The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild</em>, you can reach beyond 300 hours of total playtime</strong>. This is obviously a task best reserved for the franchise’s most dedicated fans, as it requires an immense amount of work. But for those looking to truly absorb every morsel of <em>Zelda </em>goodness, there are months of fun to be had here.</p><p><em>The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild</em> is available now for Nintendo Switch.
