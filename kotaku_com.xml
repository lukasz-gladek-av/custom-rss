While not officially announced, it’s all but a slam dunk now that <em>Dragon Ball: Sparking Zero</em> will arrive on Switch 2, likely some time before the end of 2025. </p><p>The game came to PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC last fall with fun cinematic tag-team fights that mostly made up for its lackluster single-player  offerings. Especially notable was that local couch co-op battles were limited to a single stage. There was also a fair amount of debate around the character balancing for online competitive play, something the series hasn’t traditionally been known for but which more players expect in the modern world of ranked leaderboards. </p><p>While <em>Dragon Ball: Sparking Zero</em> is currently playable on Steam Deck, it remains to be seen how much performance it can squeeze out of the Switch 2. I have a hard time imagining it will  push beyond 30fps, but the cel-shaded art style might hold up surprisingly well in handheld mode. It would be extra neat if the Switch 2 version had special motion control options, harkening back to <em>Tenkaichi 3</em> on Wii, though I’m not holding my breath.</p><p>The game has been getting a steady stream of DLC since it released, with its first set of <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ut2y8gAv3aY&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ut2y8gAv3aY" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Daima characters joining the fighting roster last week</a></span>.

In its first weekend in theaters, the R-rated original horror film brought in more than $55 million over Easter weekend. And that’s just in the United States. It was an impressive haul, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.salon.com/2025/04/26/the-smash-success-of-sinners-could-shift-hollywoods-power-balance/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.salon.com/2025/04/26/the-smash-success-of-sinners-could-shift-hollywoods-power-balance/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">even if some tried to downplay it</a></span>. <em>Sinners</em> cost around $90 million to make, not counting marketing, so some worried that the pricey horror film wouldn’t be able to break even or make a profit. But given its continued success, I think those concerns are gone now. </p><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.boxofficemojo.com/release/rl2153611265/weekend/?ref_=bo_rl_tab#tabs&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.boxofficemojo.com/release/rl2153611265/weekend/?ref_=bo_rl_tab#tabs" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">On April 28, <em>Box Office Mojo</em> reported</a></span> that during its second weekend in theaters, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://variety.com/2025/film/news/sinners-box-office-massive-second-weekend-star-wars-revenge-of-the-sith-rerelease-scores-1236379466/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://variety.com/2025/film/news/sinners-box-office-massive-second-weekend-star-wars-revenge-of-the-sith-rerelease-scores-1236379466/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>Sinners</em> earned $45 million</a></span>. That’s just a six percent drop from its opening weekend returns. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.boxofficemojo.com/chart/smallest_second_weekend_gross_drop/?by_release_scale=super_saturated&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.boxofficemojo.com/chart/smallest_second_weekend_gross_drop/?by_release_scale=super_saturated" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">That kind of small drop is really rare these days</a></span>, especially for a live-action original film. And it’s nearly unheard for horror movies, which tend to lose momentum after the first weekend. </p><p>In comparison, <em>Megan</em> in 2023—which was a very popular horror movie—dropped nearly 40 percent in its second weekend. 2018's massively popular <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.boxofficemojo.com/release/rl1342342657/weekend/?ref_=bo_rl_tab#tabs&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.boxofficemojo.com/release/rl1342342657/weekend/?ref_=bo_rl_tab#tabs" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>Halloween</em> reboot/sequel dropped 58 percent</a></span> in its second weekend. So yeah, live-action horror hits rarely drop so little. It’s a good sign for WB and Coogler that <em>Sinners</em> will likely have some long legs going into May. Currently, the movie’s total worldwide box office score is $161 million. </p><p>Meanwhile, <em>Revenge of the Sith</em> was re-released in theaters over the weekend and shocked everyone,<span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.boxofficemojo.com/release/rl2905833473/weekend/?ref_=bo_rl_tab#tabs&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.boxofficemojo.com/release/rl2905833473/weekend/?ref_=bo_rl_tab#tabs" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"> earning an astounding $42 million globally</a></span>, with more than half that coming from the US alone. That’s wild for a movie that has been easily accessible via streaming for over a decade now. The 20-year-old <em>Star Wars</em> sequel was the second-biggest movie in the United States, behind <em>Sinners</em>, and just in front of Ben Affleck’s newly released <em>The Accountant 2</em>. </p><h2 id="h20806"><a id=""></a>Do people want new ideas or nostalgic rereleases? Yes</h2><p>Why I find this weekend’s box office results so weird is that you can easily use the same numbers to argue to very different ideas. </p><p>You can point to <em>Revenge of the Sith</em>’s big haul and suggest that audiences are less hungry for new movies than ever before, and are willing to pay theater ticket prices to watch something from 20 years ago. However, you could also point to <em>Sinners</em> having a record-breaking second weekend and suggest that audiences demand new ideas and movies. Honestly, I’d say that both takes are correct. I think people are more likely to watch comfort food over something new, but there is a demand for fresh movies from famous directors with proven track records. </p><p>I think people—as always—want good movies, or to have fun at the theater, or both. And it doesn’t matter if the film is old, new, unique, or a sequel. The secret really is: Make good movies people like. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/minecraft-movie-review-bad-jack-black-kids-movie-steve-1851775345&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/minecraft-movie-review-bad-jack-black-kids-movie-steve-1851775345">But then again, <em>Minecraft</em> crossed $800 million at the box office this weekend and that movie sucks</a></span>. </p><p>So actually, I have no idea what people want. Never mind. </p><p>&nbsp;.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
