It’s the first stage of what seems likely to be the biggest showdown since <em>Helldivers 2</em> launched more than a year ago.</p><p>Weapon customization will be the big new tool in players’ arsenals. The long-requested feature lets you level up most primary weapons by completing missions, unlocking new attachments and patterns for requisition in the process. It should allow players a much higher level of precision over how their favorite weapons look and feel, letting them mix-and-match from different sights, ammo clips, and recoil dampeners. Most importantly, it’ll give diehard recruits who have been helldiving for hundreds of hours something new to grind toward. </p><p>The latest patch also adds new enemy types to the ranks of the Illuminate. There are the Stingray jetfighters that will deploy strafing runs against players, Crescent Overseers bombarding from the skies, and Frankenstein’s monsters called Fleshmobs that sound like Cronenbergian abominations as nasty to behold as they are to try to kill. Developer Arrowhead Game Studios is also hinting at “sightings of other, even larger ships” that might emerge in the days and weeks ahead. </p><p>The new changes to <em>Helldivers 2</em>'s universe arrive just ahead of the <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/Helldivers/comments/1khq2bd/masters_of_ceremony_warbond_drops_on_may_15th/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Helldivers/comments/1khq2bd/masters_of_ceremony_warbond_drops_on_may_15th/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">new Masters of Ceremony Warbond on May 15</a></span>.

It’s the perfect set of rewards to roll out just as <em>Helldivers 2</em>'s biggest battles are about to get underway, even if the armor passives look pretty underwhelming.

Some of the highlights include more precision for SGMs, higher damage fall-off for pistols, less stamina consumed by melee attacks, and burn damage that scales against bigger enemies. But don’t worry, “The Helldiver is now slightly more resistant to being set on fire,” as well. Most importantly, the R-36 Eruptor, an old favorite, is now back on the menu thanks to a number of buffs. </p><p>All in all, it’s feeling like the best time to return to PVE  extraction shooter since the Illuminate <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/helldivers-2-illuminate-omens-tyranny-free-update-1851720355?_gl=1*1pte4dp*_ga*MTg4NjY0MzM1NS4xNzM5NDU1MDcz*_ga_V4QNJTT5L0*czE3NDcxNDA1MzEkbzE5MyRnMSR0MTc0NzE0NjE1MCRqNjAkbDAkaDA.&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/helldivers-2-illuminate-omens-tyranny-free-update-1851720355?_gl=1*1pte4dp*_ga*MTg4NjY0MzM1NS4xNzM5NDU1MDcz*_ga_V4QNJTT5L0*czE3NDcxNDA1MzEkbzE5MyRnMSR0MTc0NzE0NjE1MCRqNjAkbDAkaDA.">first arrived in <em>Helldivers 2</em> last December</a></span>.
