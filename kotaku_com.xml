              <p>Soundbars don’t have to cost close to $1,000 like the Sonos Arc Ultra to make your TV’s sound much better, especially if your current TV speakers sound weak and thin. Amazon’s <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5862/">Fire TV Soundbar is currently on sale for $99, down from its regular price of $119</a> and this is the kind of aggressive pricing that Amazon uses for all of its hardware brands (including Ring, Blink, and eero). This 2.0 speaker system has two speakers that fit naturally under most TVs without taking over your entertainment center and it makes sound fuller, dialogue clearer, and bass deeper.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5862/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Virtual surround sound that is better than its price</h2>
<p><strong>DTS Virtual:X technology</strong> makes it possible to hear sound in three dimensions from just two speakers, instead of needing several satellite speakers placed around the room. The processing looks at audio signals and makes it seem like sound is coming from different directions and heights and makes movies, shows, and games more immersive without the cost and complexity of real surround systems. <strong>Dolby Audio suppor</strong>t makes this effect even better by keeping detail and dynamic range across all kinds of content, from quiet dialogue scenes to loud action scenes.</p>
<p>The included HDMI cable makes setup quick and easy because it connects directly to your TV’s HDMI eARC or ARC port. This one cable connection sends both audio and control signals, so the soundbar turns on when you turn on your TV and responds to volume changes from your TV remote. You don’t have to mess with optical cables, figure out how to use complicated menu settings, or set up universal remotes to make everything work well together.</p>



<p>The <strong>soundbar is 24 inches long and only 2.5 inches tall</strong> so it will fit comfortably on most TV stands and entertainment consoles without blocking your TV screen or infrared remote sensors. This small profile works best with TVs that are small to medium-sized, since a big soundbar would look out of place and take up too much space. You can put it right in front of your TV stand or mount it on the wall below your TV if you want a cleaner look.</p>
<p><strong>Bluetooth makes the soundbar more useful</strong> than just for TV audio: You can also stream music directly from your phone or tablet. You can play music from Spotify, Apple Music, or any other audio app on your device without having to turn on your TV or switch inputs. The wireless connection pairs quickly and stays stable over normal room distances, so you can control playback from your couch or even another room without losing sound.</p>



<p>If you have a Fire TV device, the integration works perfectly and lets <strong>you control both your TV and audio settings with just one remote</strong>. The soundbar automatically picks up Fire TV commands and changes the volume for different types of content and it works with smart TVs and any TV that is connected to streaming media players from other brands, like Roku, Apple TV, or Chromecast, even if you don’t use Fire TV devices.</p>
<p>You can get a big improvement in sound quality for $99 instead of $119, which is about the same price as a nice dinner out. You can find budget soundbars from generic brands in this price range, but they don’t have DTS Virtual:X processing, Dolby Audio support, or the ability to work with Fire TV like Amazon’s does.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Video Game Console Sales Just Flatlined Ahead Of The Holidays As Prices Soar]]></title>
            <link>https://kotaku.com/switch-2-ps5-prices-sales-inflation-economy-2000654196</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>A new Nintendo console is on the market <a href="https://kotaku.com/light-up-the-town-cozy-christmas-holiday-lights-simulator-steam-demo-review-2000652213">this Christmas</a> for the first time in eight years, but that apparently wasn’t enough to juice overall hardware sales. According to the latest data, last month was the worst November for new video game hardware sales in the U.S. since 1995, the year the original PlayStation launched here.</p> <p><a href="https://bsky.app/profile/matpiscatella.bsky.social">Circana’s Mat Piscatella reports</a> that only 1.6 million new consoles were sold last month, including during Black Friday. That’s just a few hundred thousand more than the 1995 low of 1.4 million. Perhaps just as surprisingly, the Switch 2 wasn’t even the best-selling hardware in November. That honor went to the PS5, a console that’s five years old and ended up not benefiting from the expected <a href="https://kotaku.com/grand-theft-auto-6-delay-november-gta6-reaction-news-2000641817"><em>Grand Theft Auto 6</em></a> launch hype this year.</p>

 <p>Part of that no doubt came down to a discrepancy in Black Friday deals. Sony was aggressively discounting the all-digital PS5 by $100 while Nintendo actually got rid of its long-standing <a href="https://kotaku.com/switch-2-black-firday-sales-2025-mario-zelda-2000642413"><em>Mario Kart 8 Deluxe</em> bundle</a> for the original Switch. The Switch 2 did end up getting some surprise discounts from retailers by <a href="https://kotaku.com/switch-2-sale-cyber-monday-mario-kart-world-walmart-amazon-2000649232">Cyber Monday</a>, but that ended up falling on December 1 this year, so it doesn’t fall within this period.</p>   <p>Piscatella reports that the average price of a new console “reached an all-time November high of $439, up 11 percent compared to a year ago.” Back in November 2019 the average was just $235. That’s partly the impact from <a href="https://kotaku.com/ps5-gta-6-price-switch-2-trump-tariff-2000618881">President Trump’s trade war</a> which led Nintendo, Sony, and Microsoft to all implement multiple rounds of price increases in 2025. A new Xbox Series X, first released five years ago for $500, now costs $650 at Best Buy.</p>

 <p>Microsoft was also notable for being the only hardware manufacturer not to discount its consoles at all during the holiday season. It’s almost as if the company’s been trying <em>not</em> to sell new hardware, encouraging players instead to play its games in the cloud or on rival platforms. The Xbox ended up coming in third for the month, even as <a href="https://kotaku.com/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-sales-activision-2000652111"><em>Call of Duty: Black Ops 7</em></a> launched as November’s best-selling game (it will likely still remain behind <em>Battlefield 6</em> for the year, however).</p> <p>Is console gaming <a href="https://kotaku.com/donald-trump-administration-white-house-halo-gamestop-2000639566">just getting too expensive</a>? Is the floor <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/US/us-economy-flashes-warning-signs-new-data-analysts/story?id=128463726">secretly falling out</a> from under the U.S. economy? Why not both, Piscatella <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/matpiscatella.bsky.social/post/3ma6uq52s3c22">suggested</a>. “Correlation does not necessarily imply causation…unless it does,” he wrote when speculating about the drop-off in console sales. With Roblox free and <em>Fortnite</em> back on phones, it’s never been easier for parents to look at the $500 sticker price for a new system and say, “no thanks.”</p>

              <p>Mini computers offer a great way of enjoying powerful performance while keeping things minimal and mess-free. If you’re after a solid option from Apple, Amazon is making the upgrade quite easy.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4124/">If you act fast, you can grab the 2024 Mac mini desktop computer (16GB memory, 256GB storage) with the super-fast M4 chip for $479, after a nice 20% discount.</a> It’s rated as Amazon’s Choice at the retailer, and has plenty of good reviews backing it up. Those looking to have it delivered before Christmas should place their orders today, as delays can push the delivery past the holiday season. Not married to the Apple brand? There are plenty of other mini PCs going at a discount right now, too. We’ve been covering the best drops (across multiple retailers) out there, so be sure to check our Deals page to find the one that fits your needs and budget.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4124/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Supercharged By M4</h2>
<p>This mini, yet mighty PC is five by five inches of incredible power. Design-wise, it’s quite sleek and is made to sit nicely next to a monitor, or anywhere else, without cluttering things up. It runs on the powerful M4 chip, which delivers incredible performance for all your tasks, whether you’re working on a group project for school, editing a creative project, developing a presentation, or brainstorming ideas. The chip also makes it up to 13x faster than the fastest Intel-based Mac mini, which means you can rely on it for your everyday tasks, as well as those busy, productive days where you’re handling a bit too much at the same time. Additionally, macOS is quite convenient to use and lets you run all your favorite apps responsively.</p>
<p>Apple Intelligence integration takes the experience even further. It’s Apple’s personal AI system that lets you search, write, develop ideas, communicate, and create stuff with ease. You’re getting personalized tools for a bunch of tasks, which can help you get a lot more done throughout your day.</p>
<p>There’s a 16GB memory to keep things running smoothly. It’s not massive, but you should be able to perform some light multitasking with ease. Storage is taken care of by the built-in 256GB SSD. Again, it’s not the biggest out there, but it does a good job at housing all your important files and content in a single place.</p>



<p>The PC also includes Thunderbolt, HDMI, and Gigabit Ethernet ports on the back, plus, for the first time, front-facing USB-C ports and a headphone jack. These are enough to connect all your important peripherals without feeling limited. What’s more, the Mac mini plays nicely with other Apple devices like iPhones and iPads, too. When using it with your iPhone, for instance, you can mirror your smartphone on the monitor and control it from there. You can move things around, copy something on the iPhone and paste it on the Mac, reply to texts, take FaceTime calls, and more.</p>
<p>There are a lot of other features to like here, but to wrap it up, if you’ve been looking to upgrade your workstation by grabbing something fast and efficient, we highly recommend considering the 2024 Mac mini desktop computer. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4124/">It’s now going for $479, meaning you can save over $100 on your purchase, but only if you grab it quick.</a></p>
