            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Online PvPvE survival extraction shooter <a href="https://kotaku.com/arc-raiders-tips-solo-group-recycle-free-loadout-2000641174"><em>Arc Raiders</em> is very good</a>. But since launching last month, players have started to grow frustrated with the paid multiplayer game’s pricey cosmetics. And a silly helmet for a chicken is perhaps the best example of how paid skins and cosmetics can go oh so wrong, even in otherwise great games.</p> <p>On November 6, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ArcRaiders/comments/1oq8xpx/charging_10_for_a_chicken_helmet_that_you_only/">a post about a new cosmetic item for a chicken exploded in popularity on the <em>Arc Raiders</em>‘ subreddit</a>. In the game, each player has a chicken named <a href="https://arcraiders.wiki/wiki/Scrappy">Scrappy</a> who periodically provides them with random resources between matches. This chicken can only be seen in one menu of <em>Arc Raiders</em>, and yet, developer Embark has already created at least two different paid cosmetic looks for Scrappy. The newest chicken skin for sale is an old-fashioned diving helmet. This helmet alone costs 700 Raider Tokens, which translates to about $7, though due to the way the currency is sold in bundles, you’ll have to spend $10 to get that many tokens. The post about the helmet reached over 7k upvotes by Friday.</p>

   <p>Reaction to the helmet is a bit all over the place. Some players think it’s very dumb, but don’t mind because it doesn’t affect the game. Others feel like Embark is being greedy for charging so much for something that players will rarely see. There’s also a lot of confusion over why the cosmetics in <em>Arc Raiders</em> are so expensive. Keep in mind this isn’t a free-to-play game like <em>Fortnite</em>. To play <em>Arc Raiders</em>, you gotta spend $40. Some players assumed the fact that it’s a game you buy would shield it from free-to-play cosmetic guff, but this chicken helmet has made it clear that won’t be the case.</p>

 <p>“I understand this is a live service game, being supported for 10 years. But this is a bit ridiculous,” <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ArcRaiders/comments/1oq8xpx/comment/nnhcsdy/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button">said one user.</a> “Considering half the skins aren’t even a different base model and are priced half the cost of the damn game. It’s okay to speak up about these things, because ultimately greed destroys companies — even if just silly cosmetics.”</p>

   <p>That’s the other problem with this new chicken helmet. While it can be bought separately, it is also included in a cosmetic bundle that features an outfit for your in-game character. However, a lot of players noticed that this “new” skin looks nearly identical to a previously sold cosmetic outfit. This has led to some players claiming that Embark has done a mere palette swap and is charging players roughly $15 for the privilege of buying a similar skin all over again.</p> <p>I doubt these pricey and somewhat ugly skins and items will sink<em> Arc Raiders</em> anytime soon. The game is one of the most-played titles on Steam right now and shows no sign of slowing down. But these expensive cosmetics are a reminder that, somehow, <a href="https://kotaku.com/20-10-skins-expensive-microtransactions-halo-diablo-4-1851008769">we are truly in an era where a $15 to $20 skin is not just common</a>, but something most players seem to ignore or even accept. Just a few of these skins add up to the total price of <em>Arc Raiders</em>, which is wild. But if people are buying them… well.</p>

              <p>Almost nobody buys $4,000 laptops. They’re amazing on paper, sure, but they’re also out of reach for most people. That’s why <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5391/">when Dell’s Inspiron 16 laptop (1TB SSD, 32GB DDR5 RAM) suddenly drops to $999 from its regular $3,999 price</a>, it makes noise. You’re getting a powerful machine at a quarter of its usual price which is why this deal (freshly posted on Amazon for Black Friday) isn’t likely to last long.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5391/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>A Serious Laptop for Real Work and Play</h2>
<p>This laptop isn’t a lightweight in any sense other than how easy it is to carry: It’s designed to <strong>crush productivity tasks</strong> while staying flexible enough for entertainment, content creation or business use. At its core, you’ll find <strong>Intel’s new Core 7 150U processor</strong> which runs up to 5.4GHz with 10 cores and 12 threads. That’s a lot of power for something you can carry around all day, and you can feel it in how it handles demanding workloads or 4K streaming with zero slowdown. Paired with integrated Intel graphics, it provides a smooth experience without draining your battery too fast.</p>



<p>Dell gave this model the specs to back up that performance promise: You get <strong>32GB of high-speed DDR5 RAM</strong> to keep things running smoothly like editing video, compiling data, and jumping on a video call-all at the same time. Plus,<strong> 1TB of lightning-fast SSD storage</strong> means your laptop boots instantly, and apps open in seconds. There’s no noise, no lag, and minimal heat.</p>
<p>For one, the design itself looks and feels premium. The <strong>screen is a 16-inch touchscreen with Full HD+ resolution</strong>, supported by IPS and WVA technology, meaning users will get more vivid colors and wider viewing angles ideal for either presentation work or creative sketching. With 300 nits of brightness and anti-glare protection, you can confidently work in bright cafes or by a window without any reflections getting in the way.</p>



<p>Connectivity is another area where this laptop doesn’t compromise. It comes with all the right modern ports — USB-C, HDMI, Wi-Fi 6E, and Bluetooth 5.3 — which means pairing devices or hooking up monitors is fast and painless. The HD webcam and noise-canceling microphones make every virtual call sharper and more professional, while the backlit keyboard keeps late-night typing sessions comfortable.</p>
<p>For its class, battery life holds up solidly enough that getting through a full workday or cross-country flight without scrambling for an outlet is quite achievable. It comes with <strong>Windows 11 Pro installed by default</strong> and keeps the system stable and secure-a nice touch for those who rely on their machine daily for professional use.</p>
<p>It isn’t shy about discounts, though: Amazon has now dropped this Dell Laptop to an all-time low of $999 for Black Friday, a full 75% off its usual price. Black Friday deals this deep don’t stay live for long and this one might vanish as quickly as it appeared.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/echo-show-5-is-back-to-its-black-friday-record-low-amazons-smart-display-now-costs-pennies-2000642078</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/echo-show-5-is-back-to-its-black-friday-record-low-amazon%E2%80%99s-smart-display-now-costs-pennies.1346971/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>There’s something addictive about smart displays once you start using one: You can check the weather, set alarms, play your favorite playlists, video call friends or peek into your connected cameras-all with a quick voice command. The Amazon Echo Show 5 nails that balance between screen and speaker and makes it one of the easiest smart home upgrades you can get. Now<a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5390/"> it’s dropped to a record low of $59, down from its regular $89 price</a> which makes jumping into the Alexa ecosystem even more tempting.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5390/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>More Than a Smart Display</h2>
<p>Amazon designed the Echo Show 5 to do everything your old smart speaker can’t: The <strong>5.5-inch display may sound small, but it’s key to transforming how you interact with your assistant</strong>. You can glance at the time, watch your favorite Prime Video series, follow step-by-step recipes or see who’s at the door when paired with compatible cameras. It’s like having an assistant that also gives you context-perfect for those times when hearing isn’t enough.</p>



<p>This generation takes the experience up a notch: The sound is clearer, with twice the bass of older models, meaning your playlists and podcasts actually sound like something worth playing out loud. You can stream directly from Amazon Music, Spotify or any connected app with a nice balance between rich low tones and crisp vocals. And when it’s sitting idle, the screen doubles as a digital photo frame. You can set it to display your favorite pictures or even invite family members to share their own directly to your device. It includes <strong>unlimited cloud photo storage for Prime members</strong>, so it’s as much of a family hub as it is a gadget.</p>



<p>Then there is the way it doubles as your <strong>smart home control center</strong>: You can dim the lights, turn up the thermostat, or get a glimpse of what’s happening on the security feed-all with your voice or a tap. If you have compatible Ring doorbells and cameras, you’ll be able to view real-time footage right from the display. Alexa routines can automate your mornings, too: wake up to gradual light, a daily news briefing, and a playlist softly fading in before breakfast.</p>
<p>With Amazon, privacy remains front and center here. The Echo Show 5 incorporates several layers of protection such as a physical camera shutter and a microphone/camera off button. It is up to you when it’s listening and when it is not. The 2MP camera keeps you in touch through video calls using the Alexa app or another Echo device. It serves as a quick way to check up on family or roommates without opening up your phone.</p>
<p>Amazon is officially returning the Echo Show 5 to its all-time low price of $59 for this early Black Friday deal.</p>

              <p>We’re all now used to every big-name game coming out in five differently priced versions, each containing more in-game stuff than the last, but no matter which you choose you will still be buying the <em>same game</em>. That’s never been the case for the mainline&nbsp;<em>Pokémon&nbsp;</em>series, starting even with its very first English-language release in 1998 with <em>Pokémon Red</em> and <em>Pokémon Blue</em>, each version subtly (but to fans, crucially) different. But have you ever stopped to wonder why? The reason is wonderfully silly.</p> <p>Creating two versions of what mostly boils down to the same game is certainly not an obvious choice. It introduces a huge amount of confusion to an unaware audience, not sure which is the most recent game or whether they’re making a mistake by buying one over the other. To those familiar with the series, it’s a huge feature and selling point, and deciding which version of the game you’re going to buy and why is a big part of the experience. But given the fear of alienation and confusion, it’s hard to imagine most marketing executives would ever allow such a conceit to survive its first boardroom whisper. Yet one of the best-selling game series of all time suggests it can work out OK.</p>

 <p>But why? Well, as&nbsp;<em><a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/pokemon/nintendo-legend-shigeru-miyamoto-says-one-of-the-reasons-pokemon-red-and-green-were-made-was-because-creator-satoshi-tajiri-joked-mario-couldnt-be-surpassed-unless-fans-were-sold-2-copies-of-a-game/">GamesRadar</a>&nbsp;</em>spotted via <a href="https://x.com/Genki_JPN/status/1986266577789133097">Genki_JPN’s X account</a>, in a recent shareholders meeting Nintendo director Shigeru Miyamoto was asked if anything could ever outsell <em>Mario Kart 8</em>. This caused him to recall a conversation with the creator of the&nbsp;<em>Pokémon</em> franchise, Satoshi Tajiri, about how the monster-catching games could ever outdo the success of the <em>Mario&nbsp;</em>games. Via machine translation, <a href="https://www.nintendo.co.jp/ir/pdf/2025/251105_2.pdf">Miyamoto told investors</a>, “A long time ago, Tajiri-san, the director of <em>Pokémon</em>, joked with me that if you want to surpass Nintendo’s <em>Mario </em>you’ll have to sell two copies of the game to each customer.”</p>

 <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">In a shareholders meeting Shigeru Miyamoto shared a story about Pokémon creator Satoshi Tajiri and one of the reasons Pokémon Red and Green came to be!</p> <p>"A long time ago, Tajiri-san, the director of Pokémon, before creating the first Pokémon game, once joked to me ‘If you want to… <a href="https://t.co/YTS4AvAbu9">pic.twitter.com/YTS4AvAbu9</a></p> <p>— Genki✨ (@Genki_JPN) <a href="https://twitter.com/Genki_JPN/status/1986266577789133097?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 6, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <p>Miyamoto continued, “This was one of the reasons why <em>Pokémon Red&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Green</em> were created.”</p> <p>(In Japan, the games were originally released in 1996 as&nbsp;<em>Red</em> and&nbsp;<em>Green</em>, with a&nbsp;<em>Blue</em> later the same year.)</p> <p>For what it’s worth, it’s rarely actually worked! As phenomenally successful as the <em>Pokémon&nbsp;</em>games have been,&nbsp;<em>Mario</em> tends to beat them on each system. The two wins for <em>Pokémon</em><em>&nbsp;</em>in this match-up have been <em>Pokémon Gold </em>and&nbsp;<em>Silver</em> on Game Boy Color and <em>Pokémon</em> Ruby and&nbsp;<em>Sapphire</em> on Game Boy Advance. On the DS, 3DS and Switch, <em>Mario</em> has taken the lead each time. (There were no mainline <em>Pokémon</em> games on Wii or Wii U.) But it certainly hasn’t hurt, either, with&nbsp;<em>Sword</em> and&nbsp;<em>Shield</em> selling 26.84 million copies, and&nbsp;<em>Scarlet </em>and&nbsp;<em>Violet</em> hitting 27.15 million. It’s just that&nbsp;<em>Mario Kart 8</em> has rather rudely sold 69.56 million, <em>Super Smash Bros</em>. <em>Ultimate</em> 36.93 million, and&nbsp;<em>Super Mario Odyssey</em> 29.84 million.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><span>Sony is filing a lawsuit against an eBay seller who it accuses of selling fake PlayStation 5 accessories, such as carrying cases for the console and its various peripherals, claiming that it has made unauthorized use of the company’s trademarks.</span></p> <p><span>As </span><a href="https://thegamepost.com/sony-lawsuit-ebay-counterfeit-playstation-5-accessories-2-million/"><i><span>The Game Post</span></i></a><span> lays out, Sony’s lawsuit against eBay user “zaocuand-002” has the company seeking potentially millions of dollars in damages as it continues to target counterfeit PlayStation products being sold around the internet. eBay is but one of several platforms Sony has been combing through in its search for fake PS5 accessories, as it has also gotten into legal scraps with sellers on Amazon, Walmart, and other sites.</span></p>

 <p><span>Sony has previously targeted “dozens” of anonymous marketplace sellers in its lawsuits targeting counterfeit PS5 accessories, but this latest eBay lawsuit specifically homes in on the zaocuand-002 account which has, according to </span><i><span>The Game Post</span></i><span>, sold over 9000 items on the platform. A PS5 carrying case is specifically mentioned in the lawsuit, but this listing has seemingly been taken down after the lawsuit was filed in October. Sony’s suit demands that platforms such as eBay “shall disable and cease displaying any advertisements used by or associated with Defendant in connection with the sale of counterfeit and infringing goods using the PlayStation Trademarks</span><span>.” </span><span>Alternatively, the company requests up to $2 million “for each and every use” of the counterfeit trademark, as well as compensation for its legal fees.</span></p>

 <p><span>“Defendant created an e-commerce store operating under at least the Seller Alias that is advertising, offering for sale, and selling Unauthorized Products to unknowing consumers,” the complaint reads. “Defendant attempts to avoid and mitigate liability by operating under at least the Seller Alias to conceal both its identity and the full scope and interworking of its counterfeiting operation.”</span></p> <p><span>Sony’s been getting pretty lawsuit-happy these past few months, as the PlayStation company is also </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/horizon-lawsuit-sony-tencent-clone-knock-off-light-1851787163"><span>suing Tencent over a pretty blatant </span><i><span>Horizon Zero Dawn </span></i><span>knock-off</span></a><span>. However, the Chinese publisher claims Sony is </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/light-of-motiram-horizon-lawsuit-sony-tencent-monopoly-2000626858"><span>trying to monopolize open-world genre conventions</span></a><span> with the suit.</span></p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/elden-ring-nightreign-is-getting-dlc-in-the-next-five-months-and-i-am-so-ready-for-the-comeback.1346866/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Talk to any <a href="https://kotaku.com/elden-ring-nightreign-review-in-progress-difficulty-1851782700"><em>Elden Ring Nightreign</em></a> fan lately and you’ll find a tarnished husk eager for a reason to jump back into their favorite obsession of 2025. Even after spending hundreds of hours toiling across the same map and fighting the same bosses we’re hungry for more, especially after the game’s new <a href="https://kotaku.com/elden-ring-nightreign-hard-mode-deep-night-ranked-2000620376">Deep of Night ranked mode</a> ended up being a dud. Well, we apparently only have to wait a little longer. FromSoftware’s parent company has confirmed the game’s first official paid DLC will arrive by April 2026.</p> <p>That morsel of good news came in Kadokawa Corporation’s <a href="https://ssl4.eir-parts.net/doc/9468/ir_material_for_fiscal_ym13/190133/00.pdf">latest financial earnings report</a>. In it, the company said the <em>Elden Ring</em> spin-off exceeded sales expectations but fell off steeply in the second quarter. It’s hopeful an expansion can revive the game’s momentum the same way <em>Shadow of the Erdtree</em> did with the original game.</p>

 <p>“FromSoftware is currently developing <em>Elden Ring Nightreign DLC</em> (planned for release in FY2025), <em>Elden Ring Tarnished Edition</em> (planned for release in 2026 for Nintendo Switch 2), and <em>The Duskbloods</em> (planned for release in 2026),” Kadokawa Corporation confirmed. Is FromSoftware working on anything else for next year? <a href="https://kotaku.com/dark-souls-3-remaster-armored-core-6-fromsoftware-1851786550">Previous rumors</a> suggested it’s next game isn’t as far away as some fans might think, with hints that it could be a new <em>Armored Core</em> or a remaster for <em>Dark Souls III</em>.</p>

 <h2><em>Nightreign</em> needs a new map</h2> <p>But for <em>Nightreign</em> sickos like myself, the DLC will be more than enough to keep us occupied, at least if it’s on par with the studio’s previous expansions. What does that wishlist include? A new map, for one. I’ve grown quite <a href="https://kotaku.com/elden-ring-nightreign-tips-items-wending-grace-flask-1851782963">fond of Limveld</a> during my time there, but it represents only a small, randomized portion of the original game’s big open world. There are so many other parts that could be adapted into similarly sized, procedurally generated maps.</p>

 <p><em>Nightreign</em> is, first and foremost, a game about logistics and cost-benefit analysis. Much of that decision making has become streamlined and rote as players have become experts in all of the tradeoffs and probabilities underlying the current map. A new one, in addition to a fresh visual palette and new enemies and points of interest to draw upon, would almost feel like a sequel.</p>

 <p>Fans have also been begging for <a href="https://kotaku.com/elden-ring-nightreign-renant-summon-necromancy-faith-1851784379">more character classes</a> to try. There are currently eight in the game and most players have settled in on their favorites. Two new classes, especially ones that favor different weapons and abilities than the existing ones, would be another draw. New bosses also seem like a must for any DLC. FromSoftware has its entire Soulsborne back catalog to draw from, and the time it takes not just to learn new encounters but master them is no small investment.</p> <p>That’s especially the <a href="https://kotaku.com/elden-ring-nightreign-everdark-sovereign-libra-fissure-1851786568">case for the Nightlords</a> that cap off each run. The game currently has eight. Add four more and their Everdark variants and we’ll essentially have <em>Nightreign 2</em>. But I’ll settle for anything at this point. I just want a reason to send out party invites, round up the crew, and get our asses kicked like it’s launch all over again.</p>
