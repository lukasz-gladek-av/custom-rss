At one point a chicken enters the arena and then a baby zombie is lowered onto the chicken’s back, creating a Chicken Jockey, a rare sighting in the actual <em>Minecraft </em>game. The line and moment, which first appeared in a trailer, has quickly become a viral meme online thanks to social media and TikTok. And while most of the time people just shout out the line and laugh, some showings have reportedly become more chaotic as younger fans and teens toss popcorn, scream, and record the action. At least one of these incidents reportedly led to police being called to remove some troublemakers. </p><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://youtu.be/xjjKFmT-kDs&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://youtu.be/xjjKFmT-kDs" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">As explained in this new video from YouTuber Zyphon</a></span>, the Chicken Jockey meme has exploded in the last few days as the movie hit theaters. In the video, one particular incident is highlighted involving a large number of younger audience members tossing popcorn in the air the moment the line was uttered. </p><p>According to Zyphon and others reporting on the incident, the crowd was so rowdy and chaotic that eventually the police were called and some of the people who allegedly started the chaos were removed from the theater before the <em>Minecraft Movie </em>continued. </p><p>Outside of this incident, you can find <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.tiktok.com/search?q=chicken%20jockey&amp;t=1744062582121&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.tiktok.com/search?q=chicken%20jockey&amp;t=1744062582121" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">plenty of folks sharing clips online</a></span> of people <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.tiktok.com/@willyispr0/video/7489979161075846446?q=chicken%20jockey&amp;t=1744062582121&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.tiktok.com/@willyispr0/video/7489979161075846446?q=chicken%20jockey&amp;t=1744062582121" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">screaming and clapping and tossing popcorn around the moment</a></span> Jack Black’s Steve says: “<span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://x.com/cureflamingofan/status/1908629932005351527&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://x.com/cureflamingofan/status/1908629932005351527" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Chicken Jockey</a></span>.” Other scenes in the movie, including Steve’s introduction earlier in the film, have also become popular moments at which to scream and clap. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://x.com/shitpost_2077/status/1908953937459237198&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://x.com/shitpost_2077/status/1908953937459237198" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">One theater seems to have even put up a sign</a></span> asking people to not do it. </p><p>As for why this is happening, well, it’s a combination of factors. For one, <em>Minecraft </em>is a very popular game and it’s especially popular among younger audience members who might not regularly go to the theater. Another part of this is that a lot of these young moviegoers are irony-poisoned and believe genuine emotions and reactions are “cringe.” So they overreact to things like Chicken Jockey to mask their actual feelings about something. And of course, there’s the fact that these videos are going viral online. </p><p>Heck, I’m six paragraphs deep into writing about this shit. So if you are a young dude looking to get a hit video, why not go to the opening weekend of <em>Minecraft </em>and film your friends “freaking out” at the mention of chicken jockey? It’s easy clout. And that’s all that matters anymore. Clout and tariffs. Shit sucks. </p><p>Anyway, while I don’t mind people getting excited about movies, I’m not a fan of throwing popcorn around. That shit is uncool and is super loser behavior. People have to clean that up and many theaters are understaffed, meaning a bunch of overworked and underpaid movie theater employees now have to clean up piles of spilled popcorn before the next showing can begin. Don’t be a dick to people working hard to make sure you can enjoy a movie. </p><p> .</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

With a folklore-laden story that’s equally heartwarming and heartbreaking, as well as simple yet enjoyable gameplay, there’s an awful lot to love about this romp through the Deep South. If that sounds like your kind of thing, here are a few things to know before diving into <em>South of Midnight</em>.</p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="197298" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="Live Forever in the Universe of 'New World: Aeternum'" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="108" data-playlist="197298,197284,197260" data-current="197298"><div><p>Live Forever in the Universe of 'New World: Aeternum'</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197298/197298_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197298/197298_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197298/197298_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197298/197298_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"></video></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><h2 id="h40078"><a id=""></a>You’re rewarded for veering off the beaten path</h2><figure id="" data-id="448c476ce1fa8495ca07127255a23efa" data-recommend-id="image://448c476ce1fa8495ca07127255a23efa" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Hazel attacks an object with magical powers." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Hazel attacks an object with magical powers." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="false" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Compulsion Games</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="448c476ce1fa8495ca07127255a23efa" data-recommend-id="image://448c476ce1fa8495ca07127255a23efa" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Hazel attacks an object with magical powers." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p><em>South of Midnight</em> is a very linear experience, so you won’t encounter any open-world environments or large-scale level design during the campaign. However, that doesn’t mean there aren’t any side paths and secret locations to uncover. As a matter of fact, <strong>you can find things hidden all across this bayou adventure’s levels</strong>—if you take the time to look around, that is.</p><p>Most notably, <strong>exploration is rewarded with health upgrades and Floofs, the latter of which is <em>South of Midnight</em>’s form of experience points</strong>. You’ll find tons of these all over the place, but most of them will require you to take a detour from the main path in some way. Since they’re required for leveling up your skills, you should <strong>take the time to thoroughly explore locations so you can stock up on as many as possible</strong>.</p><p>In addition to health upgrades and Floofs, you can find some of the game’s readables (collectibles) and world-building moments hidden away in unexpected places in <em>South of Midnight</em>, too. And if you’re aiming to fully complete the game, you’ll want to take the extra time to find these and fill out your collection.</p><h2 id="h40079"><a id=""></a>Crouton is a huge help in fights</h2><figure id="" data-id="28067a07ad7fe0de300654e60291f81d" data-recommend-id="image://28067a07ad7fe0de300654e60291f81d" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Hazel attacks a monster." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Hazel attacks a monster." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="false" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Compulsion Games</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="28067a07ad7fe0de300654e60291f81d" data-recommend-id="image://28067a07ad7fe0de300654e60291f81d" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Hazel attacks a monster." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Hazel’s little stuffed buddy, Crouton, may not look very tough, but he’s no slouch in battle. He can be thrown into an enemy to briefly take control of them, giving you a temporary ally that can beat the hell out of your attackers for you. If you prioritize control of tougher enemies, you can take them out of the fight for a bit so you can work on the lower-tier foes. When Crouton’s control wears off, you’ll be in a much better position for tackling those big bads. </p><p>It’s a good idea to <strong>invest some skill points into Crouton Detonation and Crouton Surge</strong> as soon as they become available to further improve Crouton’s effectiveness with an AOE (Area of Effect) blast and higher overall damage, respectively. Who knew this little guy would be such a huge help?</p><h2 id="h40080"><a id=""></a>Don’t rush; Soak in the story</h2><figure id="" data-id="b2fdc2c44cf824591bcc4c76f8596108" data-recommend-id="image://b2fdc2c44cf824591bcc4c76f8596108" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Hazel walks into an oversized magical lab." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Hazel walks into an oversized magical lab." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="false" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Compulsion Games</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="b2fdc2c44cf824591bcc4c76f8596108" data-recommend-id="image://b2fdc2c44cf824591bcc4c76f8596108" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Hazel walks into an oversized magical lab." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Speaking of readables and world-building moments, <em>South of Midnight</em> is a story-driven title that also rewards you with lore and intriguing backstories if you take the time to invest in it. While the main campaign has plenty of compelling story beats on its own, taking the time to read notes and interact with items in the world can help build out the narrative, which will give you even more insight into the history and troubles of those in this fictional version of the Deep South. </p><hr><p><em>South of Midnight</em> is available on April 8, 2025 for Xbox Series X/S and Windows PCs.</p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
