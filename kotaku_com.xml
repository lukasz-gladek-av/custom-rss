              <p data-start="0" data-end="620">As the new year begins, it’s a natural time to think about fresh starts, new routines, and treating yourself to something that actually adds value to your daily life. This is the perfect moment to invest in a piece of tech that supports your health, productivity, and lifestyle moving forward. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6636/">Apple’s latest release, the Apple Watch Series 11, launched earlier this year and is already seeing impressive discounts of up to 25%, making it a smart and timely upgrade to kick off the year.</a></p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6636/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2 data-start="1323" data-end="1927">What’s New in the Series 11</h2>
<p data-start="1323" data-end="1927">The Apple Watch Series 11 represents Apple’s most advanced mainstream smartwatch to date. Compared to earlier generations, it brings noticeable improvements in health tracking, durability, connectivity, and overall software experience. The redesigned Liquid Glass interface gives the display a cleaner, more modern look. Enhanced Smart Stack widgets make it easier to access relevant information throughout the day, while new gesture-based controls—like a one-handed wrist flick to dismiss notifications—add convenience to everyday use.</p>
<p data-start="1929" data-end="2460">Health and fitness remain at the core of the Apple Watch experience. The Series 11 supports a wide range of biometric tracking features, including heart rate monitoring, ECG readings, blood oxygen levels, cycle tracking, and sleep analysis. A new hypertension notification feature can alert users to trends that may suggest elevated blood pressure, helping them stay informed about potential health concerns. The watch has a sleep score system, making it easy to understand sleep patterns and work toward better rest.</p>
<p data-start="2462" data-end="2810">On the software side, features like Workout Buddy provide personalized fitness insights and encouragement, helping you stay motivated and consistent with your goals. And of course, the Series 11 still includes all the familiar Apple Watch integrations, such as seamless syncing with an iPhone for calls, messages, notifications, Apple Pay, and more.</p>


<p data-start="2812" data-end="3404">From a design perspective, the Series 11 stays true to Apple’s signature sleek look. It’s available in 42mm and 46mm sizes, with a choice between aluminum or premium titanium cases. The aluminum models feature upgraded Ion-X glass, which Apple claims is roughly twice as scratch-resistant as before. With water resistance up to 50 meters and added dust protection, the watch is well suited for workouts, outdoor activities, and everyday wear. Cellular models also support 5G connectivity, allowing for faster data speeds and improved performance when your iPhone isn’t nearby.</p>
<p data-start="3740" data-end="3990" data-is-last-node="" data-is-only-node=""><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6636/">If you’re looking for a meaningful way to start the new year with something that supports healthier habits, the Apple Watch Series 11 is a compelling choice.</a> The smaller 42mm model originally debuted at $399, but it’s currently available for just $299 thanks to a 25% discount. That’s a $100 savings. If you prefer a larger display, the 46mm version is also discounted. It launched at $429 and is now priced at $329, reflecting a 23% price drop. No matter which size you choose, you’re saving the same $100 for a limited time. Apple also offers a wide range of customization options, including case finishes like jet black, rose gold, and silver, along with bands in colors such as black, light blush, and purple fog, allowing you to tailor the watch to your personal style.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/bose-restocks-the-soundlink-revolve-series-ii-speaker-at-all-time-low-to-start-2026-after-year-end-clearance-2000654996</link>

              <p>Bose makes some of our favorite audio solutions around, from soundbars to headphones, speakers, and more. Those on the hunt for a portable Bluetooth speaker that keeps you entertained with your favorite songs for hours on the go should consider <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5646/">the Bose SoundLink Revolve+ Series 2 speaker, which is currently going for a 33% discount at Amazon.</a></p>
<p>This brings the total down to just $199 from $299, saving you a total of $100. The deal applies to the black color option. The stunning silver is discounted, too, sitting at $179 right now. Note that the retailer has marked both the discounts as limited-time offers, so we’re not expecting them to last long. Grab them before it’s too late!</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5646/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Keeps the Party Going</h2>
<p>The 10W speaker looks like an adorable mini lantern. It comes with a built-in handle for portability, plus features all the essential controls right at the top for easier management. Small size doesn’t mean a compromise on performance, though. You’ll enjoy stable, rich sound for all your favorite tracks, whether you’re jamming to the latest Post Malone song or just want to have some calm music playing in the background as you wrap up those last-minute Christmas gifts.</p>
<p>Audio connection options include Bluetooth and a 3.5 mm stereo audio cable, whichever you prefer. A wireless range of up to 9 m (30 ft.) lets you move around with ease when you have your device connected to the speaker wirelessly. Pairing couldn’t be simpler. The dedicated app offers a drag-and-drop interface where you can switch between Bluetooth devices within seconds. For reference, Revolve 2 Plus can keep track of the last eight connected devices at the same time. There’s a built-in microphone, too, which lets you take calls directly from the speaker without going through the hassle of disconnecting your phone first. This also makes it easy to communicate with your voice assistant to get other things done, such as checking the schedule, creating a playlist, adjusting volume, etc.</p>



<p>Reliability comes from the speaker’s IP55 water-resistant rating. This protects it from everyday water splashes (by the pool, in the shower), plus light drizzle, ensuring the party goes on in all weather conditions. As for the battery life, a single charge gets you up to 17 hours of playtime, meaning you can go at least a couple of days without plugging it in.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5646/">It usually goes for around $300, but the current 33% discount lets you pick it up for less than $200 today.</a> Both the silver and black versions are discounted, so there are options to choose from. But again, the discount is only around for a short time, so it’s best to grab the speaker quickly. We also suggest taking a look at the delivery timeline during checkout to know if you’ll receive it before Christmas or after New Year’s. That said, we’re spotting plenty of other audio solutions going for less at Amazon, too. The retailer’s own devices are currently available at up to 60% off, which makes now a great time to stock up on some essentials, plus high-ticket items, without blowing your budget.</p>
