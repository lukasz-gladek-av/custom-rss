And if you somehow don’t own <em>Half-Life 2</em>, well, it’s free to grab over the weekend. </p><p>Perhaps the biggest new addition to the 2004 shooter <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.half-life.com/en/halflife2/20th&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.half-life.com/en/halflife2/20th" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">as part of this update</a></span> is that <em>Lost Coast </em>(a small free side-game), <em>Episode 1, </em>and <em>Episode</em> <em>2</em> are now included as part of the full <em>Half-Life 2</em> package, so you can play all of these games within <em>Half-Life 2. </em></p><p>Speaking of <em>Lost Coast</em>, ever since Valve launched that small experience it has included developer commentary in its games. However, <em>Half-Life 2</em> lacked this feature, and that’s now been rectified with this update. Valve got the ol’ gang back together and recorded nearly 4 hours of commentary for the FPS. They also did a big documentary about <em>Half-Life 2</em> and <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/preview/valve-reveals-early-gameplay-of-canceled-half-life-2-ep-1851701011?rev=1731712110253&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/preview/valve-reveals-early-gameplay-of-canceled-half-life-2-ep-1851701011?rev=1731712110253">spilled the beans on<em> Episode 3</em>'s development and cancellation, too</a></span>. </p><p>Another big feature included in this update, alongside improved gamepad controls and auto-aim, is the inclusion of Steam Workshop support. This will make it easier than ever to add new levels, guns, and mods to the extremely moddable PC game. There’s basically 20 years’ worth of mods out there that can now be migrated to the Workshop and made easier than ever to access. </p><p>Valve also updated a ton of smaller parts of <em>Half-Life 2</em>, including fixing old bugs, adding new graphical options for blood splatter, tweaking HDR settings, and more. Thankfully, if you don’t like these changes or have a mod that relies on the old version, Valve isn’t removing the OG <em>HL2 </em>from Steam. You can still download it and enjoy all your mods and old memories. </p><p>And best of all, Valve has made <em>Half-Life 2 </em>(which now includes all the <em>Episodes</em>) totally free for the next three days. You have until November 18 to grab <em>Half-Life 2</em> on Steam for $0 and you should. It’s one of the best games ever made, and the mods alone will keep you busy for the next 20 years.</p><p>If this seems familiar, that’s because back in November 2023, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/new-half-life-1-free-update-patch-25-steam-deck-maps-pc-1851031923?_gl=1*426pk2*_ga*MzQzNjkwNDM2LjE2NDY2NjQ1NzQ.*_ga_V4QNJTT5L0*MTczMTY4MTIxMC4xMTYuMS4xNzMxNzEzMDY2LjYwLjAuMA..&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/new-half-life-1-free-update-patch-25-steam-deck-maps-pc-1851031923?_gl=1*426pk2*_ga*MzQzNjkwNDM2LjE2NDY2NjQ1NzQ.*_ga_V4QNJTT5L0*MTczMTY4MTIxMC4xMTYuMS4xNzMxNzEzMDY2LjYwLjAuMA..">Valve did a similar big Anniversary update for the original<em> Half-Life</em></a></span> to celebrate 25 years of the franchise.

The update includes new commentary, quality-of-life features, Steam Workshop support, and more. However, perhaps the most exciting thing to come out of this big <em>Half-Life 2</em> celebration is a new two-hour documentary from Valve detailing the development of the famous first-person shooter and its follow-up episodes. And yes, they talk about<em> </em><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/15-years-ago-this-month-valve-announced-half-life-2-e-1846995929&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/15-years-ago-this-month-valve-announced-half-life-2-e-1846995929"><em>Half-Life 2 Episode 3</em></a></span>, the game that never came to be despite millions of players begging Valve to make it. </p><p>Here’s the documentary if you haven’t watched it yet: </p><p>At the end of the doc, after talking about <em>Episode</em>s<em> 1 </em>and <em>2</em>, numerous people who worked on <em>Half-Life 2</em> and its episodes then began talking about  <em>Episode 3</em>. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://youtu.be/YCjNT9qGjh4?t=6817&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://youtu.be/YCjNT9qGjh4?t=6817" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Valve was apparently working on an ice gun</a></span> that would let players create icy structures, pathways, and barricades during combat. Valve was also working on a blob-like monster that could split into multiple parts and go through vents and chain-link fences. However, this was all very early stuff, with <em>HL2 </em>engineer David Speyrer suggesting they were only about six months into development before plans changed. </p><p>“Even into <em>Episode 3</em>, I still don’t know what that would have been if we’d built it because it hadn’t been built,” said series writer Marc Laidlaw. </p><p>“That was the the feeling of excitement. Of something I can’t even imagine is going to happen with this team. I was not imposing a top-down, ‘This is what we must do to tell our very important tale,’ you know? It’s like, ‘Oh, we have new features, how do we use [them]? What kind of story can we do with these now?’” </p><p>According to Speyrer,<em> Episode 3 </em>was set in the Arctic—something that previously released concept art had confirmed—and he explained that the episode would focus on the missing Borealis ship referenced in both the <em>Portal</em> and <em>Half-Life</em> franchises.</p><h2 id="h147541"><a id=""></a><em>Episode 3 </em>was stopped after six months of development</h2><p>After six months of development, Speyrer says that <em>Episode 3</em> was still a “collection of playable levels in no particular order” and some story beats. He theorized that after another six months, they would have reached a “critical mass of mechanics” and at that point they could start really putting the game together for release in about a year or two, depending on “how ambitious” the team got.</p><p>Of course, that didn’t happen.<em>&nbsp;</em>In the documentary, <em>Half-Life</em> 2 devs explain that they had started to run out of things to do with the tools and features they had developed. At one point, they reference Arkane’s canceled Ravenholm episode, and how the team was struggling to do new and fun stuff with the<em> Half-Life 2</em> toolbox and engine. </p><p>“Arkane was building the Ravenholm game and even they were having trouble doing cool new stuff with this toolset, and if those guys can’t figure out a bunch of cool stuff to do with this, I think we’re running out of fuel,” said Laidlaw.</p><figure id="" data-id="7d91e32a1675fdf550ce45a874419e01" data-recommend-id="image://7d91e32a1675fdf550ce45a874419e01" data-format="jpg" data-width="3840" data-height="2160" data-lightbox="true" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Valve / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="7d91e32a1675fdf550ce45a874419e01" data-recommend-id="image://7d91e32a1675fdf550ce45a874419e01" data-format="jpg" data-width="3840" data-height="2160" data-lightbox="true" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>So everyone at Valve focused on finishing up <em>Left 4 Dead</em> and put <em>Half-Life Episode 3</em> on the back burner. And then, they felt like they had waited too long to come back and finish it.</p><p>“<em>Left 4 Dead</em> came out great,” said Speyrer. “But it took long enough—and this is  the tragic and almost comical thing about it—was it took long enough that then, by the time we considered going back to Episode 3, the argument was made like, ‘Well, we missed it. It’s too late now, you know,’ and ‘We really need to make a new engine to continue the <em>Half-Life</em> series’ and all that.”</p><p>Now, Valve feels like that was a mistake, with Speyrer adding: “In hindsight [it was] wrong. You know, we could have definitely gone back and spent 2 years to make<em> Episode 3</em>.” </p><p>Toward the end of the documentary, Valve boss Gabe Newell says that <em>Half-Life</em> <em>Alyx</em>’s ending was a somewhat “self-critical realization” that they needed to move forward with the story. </p><p>“I think that<em> Half-Life</em> represents a tool we have and promises made to customers to capitalize on innovation and opportunities to build game experiences that haven’t been [seen] previously, and I think that there are no shortage of those opportunities facing us as an industry right now,” is the final message in the doc from Newell.</p><p> .<br></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

That doesn’t mean that Denis Villeneuve’s vibes-heavy take on Frank Herbert’s novels isn’t helpful context for what’s going on in <em>Prophecy</em>, though. In fact, a working knowledge of the lore referenced in the movies provides a decent foundation for understanding the characters, motivations, and plot devices at work in the <em>Game of Thrones</em>-style prequel.</p><p><em>Dune: Prophecy</em> focuses on a religious order in Herbert’s universe called the Bene Gesserit. A group of women with mystical powers, the Sisterhood tries to manipulate political events from behind the scenes, leading all the way up to Villeneuve’s adaptations. Their plans take epochs to unfold and also revolve around, uh, eugenics. The whole thing not only offers an interesting through-line for exploring the <em>Dune</em> universe in deeper detail, but it’s also fertile soil for political intrigue, Machiavellian maneuvering, and heady sci-fi concepts that are cool to see play out on screen. Here’s a quick primer on what you need to know to catch up.</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="4bf50ca72d9e59f19611ed874f55f2ab" data-recommend-id="image://4bf50ca72d9e59f19611ed874f55f2ab" data-format="png" data-width="1057" data-height="595" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Mother Superior puts Paul's hand in a box.

Successful graduates go on to become Truthsayers for powerful families and Houses throughout the galaxy while those who show special promise are referred to as Reverend Mothers. They also try to enlist the would-be wives of emperors and other royalty in their school in order to increase their reach and power. </p><p>Beyond generally being the witches of the Dune universe, the Bene Gesserit’s larger goals is to bring about the birth of a super-being called the Kwisatz Haderach through thousands of years of genetic research and carefully arranged marriages. This ultimately ends up being Timothée Chalamet’s Paul Atreides in the movies. His mother, Lady Jessica (Rebecca Ferguson) is a member of the Bene Gesserit and the Mother Superior of that era is the one who puts his hand in the “<span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RooSqqn1FjA&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RooSqqn1FjA" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">fear is the mind killer</a></span>” box.</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="2bcb49c41ef464334f8f01a5f5f0cabc" data-recommend-id="image://2bcb49c41ef464334f8f01a5f5f0cabc" data-format="jpg" data-width="1768" data-height="994" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Jessica stands beside Paul before they leave for Arrakis.

It’s not really important <em>how</em> Reverend Mothers are able to do it, just that they can. </p><p>Of course, with great power comes great responsibility, and using the Voice <em>too</em> much would clearly bring all of their finely crafted long term plans crumbling down. Men aren’t supposed to know how to use the voice but Paul’s mother teaches him and he uses it to great and pivotal effect multiple times in the movies. </p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="75eeb9ad1ff6a7f9a8e5b2937e22722a" data-recommend-id="image://75eeb9ad1ff6a7f9a8e5b2937e22722a" data-format="jpg" data-width="1198" data-height="673" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Spice appears in the sand in Paul's hand.

Dune’s political empire, the Corrino Imperium, relies on individual houses to harvest spice from the planet’s surface, but the threat of worms and attacks by the indigenous Fremen mean the honor also comes with a lot of costs. Whoever is supposed to be in charge of the planet gets a ton of spice but is also constantly getting attacked and killed.</p><p>This makes Arrakis a consistent pain point in Dune’s delicate political order. In the movies, the planet becomes a staging ground for Paul Atreides rebellion against the Imperium and his messianic journey to terraform it into a paradise that would destroy all spice in the process. At the start of <em>Dune: Prophecy, </em>as in the start of the movies, the big question is how to get the military resources together to subdue Arrakis.</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="0baa81ae1d35badd36cedbdb308b2cf3" data-recommend-id="image://0baa81ae1d35badd36cedbdb308b2cf3" data-format="jpg" data-width="1200" data-height="675" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Dave Bautista's Rabban is dressed in black alongside other Harkonnen." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Dave Bautista's Rabban is dressed in black alongside other Harkonnen." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Warner Bros.</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="0baa81ae1d35badd36cedbdb308b2cf3" data-recommend-id="image://0baa81ae1d35badd36cedbdb308b2cf3" data-format="jpg" data-width="1200" data-height="675" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Dave Bautista's Rabban is dressed in black alongside other Harkonnen." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>In Villeneuve’s movies, House Harkonnen is portrayed by Stellan Skarsgård’s Baron, Dave Bautista’s Rabban, and Austin Butler’s Feyd-Rautha. They are all bald, pale, and sociopathically ruthless. Arrakis has been theirs to rules and harvest for generations, leading to a giant scandal when the emperor takes the planet away and gives it to House Atreides, Harkonnen’s sworn enemies.  </p><p>The Harkonnen reside on Giedi Prime, a not particularly beautiful planet made more grim by all of the over-industrialization and colosseums. While the Baron and his brood got rich from all the spice, it wasn’t always thus for House Harkonnen. The events that kick-off <em>Dune: Prophecy </em>left it very much in exile by the other powerful houses over its betrayal in the <em>Matrix</em>-like rebellion against “thinking machines” called the Butlerian Jihad. It’s basically the catalyst for everything else that happens in <em>Dune</em>.</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="bbb42fb95bc003c48d532ea71a4baf75" data-recommend-id="image://bbb42fb95bc003c48d532ea71a4baf75" data-format="jpg" data-width="1080" data-height="607" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Leto Atreides and Gurney prepare to go to Arrakis.

Residing on the watery planet of Caladan, House Atreides’ is largely considered to rule benevolently and peacefully. It’s also in good standing with many of the other powerful houses, leaving it in an uniquely advantageous and precarious place vis-a-vis the rest of the balance of power in <em>Dune</em>. </p><p>Despite prospering for generations, the first <em>Dune</em> movie sees House Atreides all but wiped out at the hands of the Harkonnen as part of a wider betrayal by the Imperium. While Paul’s journey begins in the ashes of House Atreides, during the era <em>Dune: Prophecy</em> takes place in it is very much still burgeoning power center among the rest of the Houses. </p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="e8b326882e73c0e44cf6671d33795aaa" data-recommend-id="image://e8b326882e73c0e44cf6671d33795aaa" data-format="jpg" data-width="998" data-height="562" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Javier Bardem's Stilgar guides the Fremen in Dune Part II.

In addition to using guerrilla warfare to sabatoge Spice operations, the Fremen can also ride worms and partake in experiments with worm piss and other byproducts that do all kinds of weird stuff but are also life-threateningly toxic to most people. </p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="8e8c22f0947e91e770d2ad6103b1cbcc" data-recommend-id="image://8e8c22f0947e91e770d2ad6103b1cbcc" data-format="jpg" data-width="973" data-height="548" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="People in white robes and glass masks arrive from a ship.

With complex computers outlawed following the Butlerian Jihad, ships rely on Spice-snorting pilots to calculate complex trajectories and get massive, faster-than-light fleets where they need to be. Though only mentioned in passing in the <em>Dune</em> movies, like when Paul threatens to cut off the entire Spice trade, it’s an important countervailing force to the rest of <em>Dune</em>’s political players. </p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
