It makes sense considering this game is a spin-off of <em>Story of Seasons</em>; it’s a farming game at its core. That said, you likely won’t specialize in farming for every village, but I do recommend you prioritize crops in Spring Village and Autumn Village. They both offer abundant space and the ideal climates for crop growth.</p><p>In Autumn Village, the sprawling development zone just down the hill from the shrine is large enough for a few shops, houses, and rows upon rows of crops. In Spring Village, there are multiple development zones, two of which are quite large, with enough room for tilled fields in all three.</p><p><strong>When planting crops, prioritize those with the highest return in the least amount of time.</strong> Anything over 30 gold per crop is a sound strategy, so long as they don’t take too long to mature. Some crops to prioritize include:</p><ul data-type="List" data-style="Bullet"><li>Rice</li><li>Corn</li><li>Pink Melon</li><li>Strawberry</li><li>Mandarin</li><li>Carrots</li><li>Golden Anything (Cabbage, Potatoes, Pumpkins, Turnips, etc.)</li></ul><h2 id="h570244"><a id=""></a>Herding bees</h2><figure id="" data-id="6874d2101cfa9887c858af4b05db9219" data-recommend-id="image://6874d2101cfa9887c858af4b05db9219" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A small barn for herding in Rune Factory: Guardians of Azuma." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A small barn for herding in Rune Factory: Guardians of Azuma." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Marvelous / Brandon Morgan / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="6874d2101cfa9887c858af4b05db9219" data-recommend-id="image://6874d2101cfa9887c858af4b05db9219" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A small barn for herding in Rune Factory: Guardians of Azuma." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>As you finish up the first part of Autumn Village, you’ll unlock the Herding mechanic, which allows you to construct stables in your villages and then defeat and capture monsters out in the wild. Most of these monsters will drop usable goods in the stable once you assign someone to manage the herd, and then you may sell said items.</p><p>Not all monsters are equal, though. <strong>If you want to optimize the mechanic for money-making potential, then opt for bee monsters. </strong>They’ll produce high-quality honey that sells for large sums, making you a thousandaire daily!</p><h2 id="h570245"><a id=""></a>Completing requests on the board</h2><figure id="" data-id="ff52c4fdf3e97debb48c8999eabd71c2" data-recommend-id="image://ff52c4fdf3e97debb48c8999eabd71c2" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A screenshot shows a variety of objectives." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A screenshot shows a variety of objectives." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Marvelous / Brandon Morgan / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="ff52c4fdf3e97debb48c8999eabd71c2" data-recommend-id="image://ff52c4fdf3e97debb48c8999eabd71c2" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A screenshot shows a variety of objectives." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Early on, you’ll unlock the request board. But it’s soon forgotten, as the main story pushes you in so many directions to save the gods and goddesses, restore the villages, and build relationships with men and women from around the land. When are you meant to help the villagers?</p><p>As it turns out, some of those requests pay quite well. Some offer gold, food, raw resources for crafting and construction, and even rare materials. A few pay really well, though. They’ll net you thousands of gold upon completion. The more challenging the task, the better the pay. </p><hr><p><em>Rune Factory: Guardians of Azuma</em> is available now on Nintendo Switch and Windows PCs.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://kotaku.com/rune-factory-guardians-azuma-farm-gold-monsters-teeth-1851786408]]></content:encoded>

But <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://automaton-media.com/en/news/steam-rules-updated-to-prohibit-content-that-violates-rules-set-forth-by-payment-processors-and-banks/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://automaton-media.com/en/news/steam-rules-updated-to-prohibit-content-that-violates-rules-set-forth-by-payment-processors-and-banks/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">as <em>Automaton</em> noticed</a></span>, this rule change has coincided with a purge of extreme adult games on Steam, with hundreds <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://steamdb.info/history/events/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://steamdb.info/history/events/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">marked as delisted by <em>SteamDB</em></a></span> over the last 24 hours.</p><p>We’re talking about games themed around topics like incest, rape and slavery, titles like <em>Incest Tales: Webcam Daughter</em> and <em>Reincarnation in another world going to rape All NPCs VR</em>. One franchise alone, called <em>Interactive Sex</em>, appears to have had 54 games removed, meaning you can no longer play <em>Incest Daughters Episode 4</em> or <em>Daddy Daughter Incest</em>.</p><p>That latter example (which does not feature children) has been on sale on Steam since February 28 of this year. The <em>Reincarnation</em> rape-themed VR game had been available since March 14. Both are now gone. But it’s important to note this isn’t a banhammer situation. The developer of <em>Daddy Daughter Incest</em>, EroticGamesClub, still has <em>hundreds</em> of porn games on sale on Steam, and more confusingly, these still include incest-themed games, labelled as such on the store. So it’s very hard to understand what’s happening.</p><figure id="" data-id="f17165cf4b907793187752f08b6ff863" data-recommend-id="image://f17165cf4b907793187752f08b6ff863" data-format="jpg" data-width="1016" data-height="571" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A selection of adult games on Steam." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A selection of adult games on Steam." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Valve / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="f17165cf4b907793187752f08b6ff863" data-recommend-id="image://f17165cf4b907793187752f08b6ff863" data-format="jpg" data-width="1016" data-height="571" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A selection of adult games on Steam." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>The vast majority of these games are utterly awful “visual novels,” barely interactive combinations of static images and briefly looped animated models, mostly depicting bog-standard porn-like sex acts. Most are priced at around $5, and have either no reviews or very negative remarks, the shovelware output not worth the wank. And look, I have my own opinions on these games and you have yours. I’m not here to pronounce my own boundaries, and your personal taste or distaste isn’t really relevant. Valve is very clear that it’s happy to host adult content on the store, and it offers options for customers to have all such games hidden from view. That’s why rule #3 on its guidelines says you should not attempt to distribute “Adult content that isn’t appropriately labeled and age-gated.”</p><p>The issues that I see come down to the complete ambiguity with which this new rule has been introduced. How is any developer supposed to be able to divine what might “violate the rules and standards set forth by Steam’s payment processors and related card networks and banks, or internet network providers”? Should they email Mastercard and T-Mobile to ask the corporations if they’re happy with their sex-themed tile-sliding puzzle game? (Oh god, there are <em>so </em>many sex-themed tile-sliding puzzle games on Steam.) And what are the “certain kinds” of adult content? Does everyone have to guess?</p><p>Honestly, I couldn’t care less about all these dreadful, smutty sims. They’re churned out by content factories, presumably hoping to catch the attention of horny customers, and everyone gets what they deserve when they pay $5 to watch two barely-animated custom nude models rutting back and forth. Whatever. But what concerns me is the collateral damage.</p><p>One of the real positives of Valve’s incredibly liberal approach to what it will sell is that it allows incredibly complex and difficult topics to be explored by brave developers. People regularly interrogate their own traumas through visual novels and interactive fiction, while others explore their sexual kinks via similar mediums. Victims of incest might want to create incredibly challenging games that process such experiences in healthy and productive ways—what happens here if it’s to turn out that “certain kinds” of adult themes includes such topics? And who’s deciding what’s allowed? Valve, or Visa?</p><p>And then what comes next? If we start deciding <em>this</em> is unacceptable, then where does that stop? Of course LGBTQ+ developers will be the most immediately vulnerable to such entirely ambiguous rules, where moral authority appears to have been handed to vast banking corporations.</p><p>So no, yeah, I’m grossed out by <em>Daddy Daughter Incest</em>, and don’t want to play that. (And managed not to for all the months it was available.) But that’s not the point. The point is that rules like this are deeply concerning when they’re so unclear and vague. </p><p>The UK’s Online Safety Act is a terrible, badly-constructed confusion of responsibilities, created with the pretense of protecting children, but its 250 pages are far better suited to enforcing censorship. It’s ambiguous itself, despite its enormous length—something that itself meant most politicians who voted for it had never read it. It moves responsibility for “harmful content” to internet providers and payment processors, without ever being clear what “harmful content” is, nor indeed what anyone is supposed to practically do to prevent it in the real world. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.eff.org/pages/uk-online-safety-bill-massive-threat-online-privacy-security-and-speech&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.eff.org/pages/uk-online-safety-bill-massive-threat-online-privacy-security-and-speech" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">You can read why it’s so bad here</a></span>. And while we cannot say that this is why Valve has suddenly added this confusing new rule, it’s hard not to draw parallels. And its implications become international when it means companies start trying to crack down in such confused, extreme ways.</p><p>We’ve reached out to Valve to try to get more clarity about these changes, what’s expected of developers, and whether there’s any more clear guidance on what the mysterious “certain kinds” includes. We’ll update if they get back to us.</p><p>.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://kotaku.com/steam-valve-adult-content-sex-games-online-safety-act-1851786391]]></content:encoded>

It’s entirely possible plans have changed after the creative shakeup, but Bloys says that Druckmann gave the team a “good blueprint” for the rest of the show, even if he’s not working on it himself.</p><p>“Obviously it was great to have Neil involved in the beginning,” Bloys said. “The whole reason that I wanted to do <em>Last of Us</em> is after <em>Chernobyl</em>, I said to Craig, ‘what do you want to do next?’ And <em>Last of Us</em> was what he wanted to do. That’s what was most important to me, Craig’s creative excitement about the show. It was fantastic to have Neil involved. A lot of people don’t realize that Neil has a full-time job creating video games and running Naughty Dog. It’s a really big job that he’s got. So I understand why he needs to focus on that. But I believe he’s given us a good blueprint with the show. And obviously Craig is a pro, so I think we’ll be in excellent shape. I’m not worried at all.”</p><p>Bloys isn’t worried, but I am.

One of the most important materials is Iron. It’s a raw resource found in two key zones outside of the starter area, and you’ll need plenty for base building, clothing crafting, weapons, and vehicles. I recommend designating one member of your group to farming raw resources, and pay them a pittance and a few bits of praise to keep them satisfied.</p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="197589" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="Ring Psychology: Understanding The 6 Phases Of A Wrestling Match Through Heel Era John Cena" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="659" data-playlist="197589,197586,197585" data-current="197589"><div><p>Ring Psychology: Understanding The 6 Phases Of A Wrestling Match Through Heel Era John Cena</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197589/197589_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197589/197589_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197589/197589_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/23110.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>You can scour Hagga Basin all you want, but you won’t find Iron Ore Nodes. For that, <strong>you must travel to either Eastern Vermilius Gap or Western Vermilius Gap</strong>, both directly north across a vast stretch of desert from Hagga Basin South. I learned this the hard way, but <strong>you really need a sandbike to travel across the sand here.</strong> Even crouch-walking will alert the sandworms, and they’ll consume you wholly before you can reach the other side. If you die to a sandworm, you’ll lose all of your gear and items in your inventory. Don’t do it!</p><p>Once you reach either of the Vermilius Gap regions, whip out your Cutteray Mk1, which is a key component needed to farm Iron.
