Now, over three decades later, he’s taking his leave, after helping ship dozens of legendary games and bringing many, many more to the platform from developers big and small throughout the rest of the world. His parting gift to PS5 and PS4 players is a list of 22 personal favorites for fans to dig into during <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/january-2024-game-releases-tekken-tlou-1851124958&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/january-2024-game-releases-tekken-tlou-1851124958">the January release calendar lull</a></span>. </p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="195301" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="This Brutal Gothic Metroidvania Is Shaping up To Be Something Special" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="111" data-playlist="195301,196358,196215" data-current="195301"><div><p>This Brutal Gothic Metroidvania Is Shaping up To Be Something Special</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195301/195301_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195301/195301_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195301/195301_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195301/195301_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/20762.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>Yoshida was a producer on the first <em>Crash Bandicoot</em> back in 1996 and received a special thanks in the credits of <em>Astro Bot</em> for “contributing to the creation” of the 2024 GOTY winner. During the PS3 and PS4 eras he was center stage, promoting the platform as it transformed from just a disc-playing machine into a massive distribution network for digital downloads and online gaming. His last day at Sony is January 15, though he promises he’s not retiring from the games industry entirely. </p><p>His departure will, however, mark the end of a friendlier, more fan-facing PlayStation brand. While the PS5 is more dominant than ever, the company that powers it has all but faded into the background. Gone is the era of E3 press conferences and live fanfests. Yoshida was the last familiar face from that epoch, and now he’s gone too. </p><p>To mark the occasion, January’s “monthly picks” on the PlayStation Store were personally chosen by the Sony veteran to celebrate some of the platform’s past legacy, its best exclusives, and recent indie hits from new generations of game makers. Here’s the full list of 22 recommended games:</p><blockquote data-type="BlockQuote"><ul data-type="List" data-style="Bullet"><li><em>﻿Nine Sols</em><br></li><li><em>Hades</em></li><li><em>Dead Cells</em></li><li><em>The Binding of Isaac: Repentance </em></li><li><em>Super Time Force Ultra</em></li><li><em>Doki Doki Literature Club</em></li><li><em>Sifu</em></li><li><em>Before Your Eyes</em></li><li><em>Inscryption</em></li><li><em>Persona 4 Golden</em></li><li><em>Genshin Impact</em></li><li><em>Fall Guys</em></li><li><em>Let It Die</em></li><li><em>Nioh 2</em></li><li><em>Ape Escape</em></li><li><em>Crash Bandicoot N-Sane Trilogy</em></li><li><em>Ghost of Tsushima</em></li><li><em>Returnal</em></li><li><em>Bloodborne</em></li><li><em>Sound Shapes</em></li><li><em>Journey </em></li><li><em>Shadow of the Colossus </em></li></ul></blockquote><p>Let’s note a few standouts. One is <em>Before Your Eyes</em>, a PS VR2 game about a person reflecting on their past as they make their way into the afterlife. The scenes shift every time the player blinks, underlining the fleeting nature of time and our fragile grasp on our own memories. <em>Let It Die</em>, Grasshopper Manufacture’s 2016 cult-hit survival action game about climbing a tower, is another underrated shoutout. <em>Sound Shapes</em> also deserves more love. The 2012 music-based platformer doesn’t get talked about as much these days, but it speaks to how much more diverse Sony publishing used to be in the past (<span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://x.com/mango_lychee/status/1678838942202839040&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://x.com/mango_lychee/status/1678838942202839040" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">its creator is quietly working on a new game</a></span>). </p><p>Most of the other names on the list are well-known at this point. If you haven’t already checked out <em>Nine Sols</em>, it’s a Metroidvania Souls-like in the vein of <em>Hollow Knight</em> that was one of 2024's best games. <em>Super Time Force Ultra</em>, meanwhile, is a retro shoot ‘em up in which the ghosts of prior failed runs help you out. It’s neat, pretty, and totally deserves a sequel. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://x.com/yosp/status/1878905474059554964&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://x.com/yosp/status/1878905474059554964" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Yoshida’s also playable in it</a></span>. </p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

That’s one of the selling points behind <em>The Blood of Dawnwalker</em>, a new RPG from some of the masterminds behind <em>The Witcher 3</em> and <em>Cyberpunk 2077</em>. Rebel Wolves, formed in 2022 by a bunch of ex-CD Projekt Red developers, revealed the game this week in a new teaser trailer. It looks pretty legit. </p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="196055" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="6 Things To Know Before Starting Persona 5 Tactica" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="227" data-playlist="196055,196599,196626" data-current="196055"><div><p>6 Things To Know Before Starting Persona 5 Tactica</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196055/196055_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196055/196055_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196055/196055_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196055/196055_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/21584.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>The first game in what the studio hopes will be an entire new RPG saga, <em>The Blood of Dawnwalker</em> is a narrative-driven, single-player, open-world, dark fantasy action-RPG. It’s being made in Unreal Engine 5 for PlayStation 5, Xbox X/S, and PC. The game is currently in alpha with more updates promised later in the year. That’s another way of saying it probably won’t be out for a while. </p><p>Players will step into the shoes of a young warrior-turned-vampire named Coen who uses otherworldly powers, including teleporting around like Nightcrawler, to fight off enemies and navigate a world where monsters come in all different forms. Like I said,<em> The Witcher </em>with vampire powers. Here’s the cinematic trailer with a quick look at gameplay near the end:</p><p>Rebel Wolves was originally formed by <em>Witcher 3</em> director Konrad Tomaszkiewicz after he left CDPR following an investigation into workplace bullying, which <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-05-04/top-director-leaves-embattled-game-developer-cd-projekt&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-05-04/top-director-leaves-embattled-game-developer-cd-projekt" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">he told <em>Bloomberg</em></a></span> ultimately found him not guilty of the charges. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2024-05-03/former-cd-projekt-developers-take-lessons-from-cyberpunk-debacle&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2024-05-03/former-cd-projekt-developers-take-lessons-from-cyberpunk-debacle" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Speaking to the same outlet last year</a></span>, he said he started the new studio out of a desire to go back to working in smaller teams where developers aren’t as pigeonholed into specific roles. He also said he’d be working on his empathy and prioritizing the well-being of the team. </p><p>Alongside its game announcement, Rebel Wolves also announced the hire of <em>The Blood of Dawnwalker</em>’s creative director: Mateusz Tomaszkiewicz. The CDPR veteran was a quest designer on multiple <em>Witcher</em> games, including the card-based spinoffs<em> Gwent</em> and <em>Thronebreaker</em>. He was also in charge of <em>Cyberpunk 2077</em>'s quests before later departing after the game released to do narrative consulting for other companies. </p><p>  “Throughout all my years in game development, story-driven role-playing adventures have always been something I was most passionate about,” Tomaszkiewicz said in a press release. “For me, nothing beats being able to fully immerse myself and discover handcrafted stories and worlds. There are so many fantastic RPGs out there today, however, I feel that there’s not only enough space but also a hunger among players for more captivating stories.”</p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
