              <p>On Sunday, a cameraman inexplicably walked onto the court during a <a href="https://kotaku.com/us-open-tennis-champion-does-video-game-celebration-aft-1847662401">US Open</a> first-round match between tennis pros Daniil Medvedev and Benjamin Bonzi. This led to the judge giving Bonzi a new serve, angering Medvedev and leading to a six-minute delay after he rallied the crowd to boo and yell at his opponent and the decision.</p> <p>On August 24 in New York City‚Äôs Louis Armstrong Stadium, Russian player Daniil Medvedev, who won the US Open in 2021, was losing his match against French player Benjamin Bonzi. When Bonzi went to complete his second serve, a cameraman walked onto the court. This forced the match umpire, Greg Allensworth, to stop play and demand that the man leave the court. The umpire then awarded Bonzi a new first serve, <a href="https://www.espn.com/tennis/story/_/id/46068258/bonzi-survives-medvedev-late-surge-chaotic-us-open-match">which <em>ESPN</em> reports</a> is common in professional tennis when situations like this occur. However, Medvedev wasn‚Äôt happy about the call and stormed up to Allensworth while yelling at the umpire.</p> <p>‚ÄúAre you a man? Are you a man? Why are you shaking?‚Äù is what Medvedev reportedly shouted at Allensworth. ‚ÄúHe wants to go home, guys, he doesn‚Äôt like it here. He gets paid by the match, not by the hour.‚Äù</p>

 <p>He then referenced another player who <a href="https://www.espn.com/tennis/story/_/id/43733166/reilly-opelka-calls-umpire-suspended-penalty">was fined earlier this year</a> after calling Allensworth the ‚Äúworst ump on tour,‚Äù shouting to the crowd, ‚ÄúWhat did Reilly Opelka say!?‚Äù multiple times and motioning with his arms for the audience to join in on his yelling. And they did exactly that.</p> <p>The US Open crowd jeered, booed, yelled, and chanted, delaying the match for nearly six minutes as Bonzi was unable to serve due to all the screaming and taunting. At multiple points during the yelling, you can see Medvedev cheer on the crowd, though eventually even he started asking them to quiet down. Meanwhile, during all of this, umpire Allensworth begged the crowd to quiet down, but it didn‚Äôt work. Eventually, the audience quieted down enough that Bonzi could serve. When the ball crashed into the net, the audience got even louder.</p> <p><iframe loading="lazy" title="Daniil Medvedev ignites crowd after a photographer walked on the court at match point | 2025 US Open" width="500" height="281" src="about:blank" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen="" data-rocket-lazyload="fitvidscompatible" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/oXmpP1kLyxQ?feature=oembed"></iframe></p> <p>While Medvedev rallied after the delay and Bonzi‚Äôs failed serve, he would ultimately lose the match to the French player and get knocked out of the US Open.</p> <p>‚ÄúFor me, it‚Äôs like my best victory ever,‚Äù said Bonzi afterwards, according to <a href="https://www.espn.com/tennis/story/_/id/46068258/bonzi-survives-medvedev-late-surge-chaotic-us-open-match"><em>ESPN</em></a>. He also directly blamed Medvedev for the extended delay and crowd yelling at him, saying that after the crowd reacted poorly to the umpire‚Äôs call, ‚Äúhe put oil on the fire.‚Äù</p> <div data-testid="paragraph-15"> <p>‚ÄúIt was crazy. I may have got some new fans, but also some new non-fans,‚Äù&nbsp; <a href="https://www.reuters.com/sports/tennis/media-mishap-sparks-medvedev-meltdown-russian-exits-us-open-2025-08-25/">said Bonzi, according to the <em>AP</em></a>. ‚ÄúThe energy was crazy. Thanks to all who were booing. Thanks for the energy. I‚Äôve never experienced something like that. We waited maybe five minutes before the match point, and it was crazy. There was so much noise.‚Äù</p> <p>After losing the first round match, Medvedev‚Äîwho told reporters later that he didn‚Äôt agree with the ump that the cameraman interfered long enough to warrant a new first serve‚Äîsat on the side of the court for a few minutes before grabbing a tennis racket and smashing it in anger in front of the remaining audience.</p> </div> <figure id="attachment_2000620047" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000620047"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000620047">¬©ESPN / US OPEN / Kotaku</figcaption></figure>

            <title><![CDATA[Metal Gear Solid 3 Remake Has Some Weird Shortcomings On Console]]></title>
            <link>https://kotaku.com/metal-gear-delta-3-remake-ps5-pro-performance-mode-2000620023</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/metal-gear-solid-3-remake-has-some-weird-shortcomings-on-console.1280001/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><em>Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater</em> overhauls the storied PS2 game with modern visuals. <a href="https://kotaku.com/metal-gear-solid-snake-eater-delta-remake-2000619269">It plays great on PC</a> but the console experience prior to launch is surprisingly bad. The Konami remake can‚Äôt hit a consistent 60fps on PlayStation 5 even in performance mode, and the PS5 Pro enhanced mode is especially disappointing. It might not be enough to ruin the experience but it raises concerns and has some wondering if Konami will be able to meaningfully optimize the console version with subsequent updates.</p> <p>Out August 26 for those who buy the Deluxe Edition, <em>Metal Gear Solid Delta</em> doesn‚Äôt really have a 60fps mode on PS5. Instead, it has a max target of 60fps, but spends much of the time dipping far below that. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Am0ER7iW2lo">A Digital Foundry analysis</a> shows it consistently falling to around 45fps in denser jungle areas, or even lower when swimming underwater. Things are even worse on PS5 Pro, where the <em>Metal Gear Solid 3</em> remake dispenses with having alternate graphics modes and simply smooshes everything into a single performance boost. But in order to hit higher framerates it uses a lower, sub-1080p image resolution resolution to upscale. The results are pretty grimy.</p> <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">MAJOR WARNING If you‚Äôre planning on playing Metal Gear Solid Delta:</p> <p>The game runs terribly, with PS5/XSX rendering 720p-1080p at 30-50FPS in Performance mode</p> <p>The PS5 Pro somehow runs worse &amp; looks blurrier despite using PSSR</p> <p>Another disastrous Unreal Engine 5 release. <a href="https://t.co/Lnha48T2C6">pic.twitter.com/Lnha48T2C6</a></p> <p>‚Äî Synth Potatoü•î (@SynthPotato) <a href="https://twitter.com/SynthPotato/status/1958820771364532707?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">August 22, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <p>Digital Foundry notes that quality mode on PS5 gets players better draw distances for textures and shadows, and improved global illumination for better complex lighting effects, which the jungle-based environment is full of. Unfortunately, despite hitting 30fps most of the time, the quality mode still occasionally buckles below that when blowing up barrels or during the busiest onscreen action sequences. Performance mode is even more inconsistent in terms of framerate, hitting 60fps fine in the starting area but sinking well below that at moments in larger environments. Overall it seems like nothing is quite as smooth as you‚Äôd hope or expect for what is essentially an Unreal Engine 5 makeover of an otherwise mostly unchanged PS2 game.</p> <h2><em>Metal Gear Solid 3</em> remake‚Äôs PS5 Pro mode is far from perfect</h2> <p>Then there‚Äôs the PS5 Pro‚Äôs mode which has its own issues. Namely, it‚Äôs upscaling from a lower resolution to hit a higher consistent 60fps, leading to even worse visual quality in the distance than on the base PS5‚Äôs performance mode. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a win in motion for PS5 Pro with a smarter handling of occlusion artifacts and swaying grass,‚Äù Digital Foundry reports. ‚ÄúBut if left to settle, the resolved reconstructed image on PS5 Pro seems to struggle to match the clarity of base PS5.‚Äù The enhanced mode gets even worse when you account for the PSSR-induced flickering and shimmering effects that PS5 Pro players may remember from <em>Silent Hill 2</em> remake.</p> <p>There‚Äôs still time to address many of these apparent problems, especially the base PS5 shortcomings, in a day-one patch, though time is running out with the game‚Äôs early access launch less than 24 hours away. As for the PS5 Pro experience, well we‚Äôll have to wait and see how that gets addressed in the future. None of the issues surfaced so far seem like deal breakers, but it does suggest anyone who has the option to play<em> Metal Gear Solid Delta</em> on a high-end PC instead should begin there.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><span>Music has a way of bringing people together. That‚Äôs literally the whole point of </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/kpop-demon-hunters-best-worst-songs-soundtrack-ranking-2000616633"><i><span>KPop Demon Hunters</span></i></a><span>, the anime-inspired musical phenomenon that is </span><a href="https://www.netflix.com/tudum/top10/most-popular"><span>approaching the top of Netflix‚Äôs most-streamed movies of all time</span></a><span>. Its titular trio of demon-slaying songstresses are the latest in a long line of hunters masquerading as a pop act, using the power of their fans‚Äô souls, ignited by their melodies, to push demons back to their hellish prison. A series of limited singalong screenings is both the natural conclusion to its entire thematic foundation, and a correction for the boneheaded business deals that sequestered a truly stunning animated musical to a streaming service.</span></p> <p><span>All that said, I was admittedly pretty underwhelmed with the showing I went to. I dragged my roommate and a visiting friend up from Brooklyn to the Alamo Drafthouse in Lower Manhattan dressed in Huntr/x t-shirts, with my friend having styled her hair to look like rapper Zoey‚Äôs signature buns in the film. We‚Äôd seen videos of the early screenings at Netflix‚Äôs theater in Los Angeles and heard a choir of fans, from adult cosplayers to young children, belting out every song, so we were prepared for a mini-concert to the backdrop of </span><i><span>KPop Demon Hunters</span></i><span>‚Äô stunning visuals. What we got was, well, not that.</span></p> <figure id="attachment_2000620030" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000620030"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000620030">¬© Photo by Kenneth Shepard</figcaption></figure> <p><span>The three of us were in the back row of one of Alamo‚Äôs smaller theaters as the host of the event tried her damndest to get the crowd more hyped, and Alamo should give that girl a raise for the work she was putting in. Despite the overwhelmingly adult crowd, the few kids were still the most excited to be there. It was pretty clear based on the adult to kid ratio that most of the crowd had not been dragged there by a child who had probably watched Huntr/x‚Äôs literal stan war on loop for the past two months, but even so, a lot of them were not playing into the show. They picked up their swag bag of ramen cups and photo cards of their bias, or favorite member of either Huntr/x or the Saja Boys, but the spirit of a singalong wasn‚Äôt flowing through the room. Maybe when the film actually started things would pick up? Nope.</span></p>

 <p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QGsevnbItdU"><span>‚ÄúHow It‚Äôs Done,‚Äù</span></a><span> the opening song in </span><i><span>KPop Demon Hunters</span></i><span>,</span> <span>is exactly the song that would tell you if the a singalong audience understood the assignment. The fast-paced, rap-heavy tune is so full of swagger and attitude that anyone who was going to sing should have been singing the second Rumi came in with an exhausted sigh and said ‚Äúyou came at a bad time‚Äù while the distorted guitar played underneath her. Our fellow moviegoers, however, did not. As the girls started rapping, my friend and I noticed that we were pretty much the only ones singing above a whisper. Yeah, I belted out ‚Äúfit check for my napalm era‚Äù at the top of my lungs to the ceiling through cupped hands, but it quickly became clear the audience we were with was not passing the vibe check.</span></p> <p><span>To view the situation charitably, it can be hard to get past the established social contract of a movie theater even when you‚Äôre told that you‚Äôre allowed to be rowdy. Most establishments play a whole video telling you to sit down, shut up, and turn your damn phone off before every movie they play. To Alamo‚Äôs credit, they had a video before the show that was like, ‚ÄúTurn the fuck up. Queen out. Power the Honmoon.‚Äù Well, if the world had been relying on the crowd in my theater, the demons would have overrun Manhattan by dinner time. Maybe if my friend and I had refused to be silenced by a bunch of quiet curmudgeons, a rising tide would have lifted all ships, but everyone else‚Äôs relative silence made it awkward. I‚Äôve been to movie experiences like </span><i><span>Avengers: Endgame</span></i><span> where the crowd was absolutely losing their shit, and I guess we were just dealt a bad hand this time around.</span></p> <figure id="attachment_2000620031" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000620031"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000620031">¬© Netflix</figcaption></figure> <p><span>At a certain point, my friend and I were mostly just singing along softly in our seats. By the time the bubble-gum sweetness of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=983bBbJx0Mk">‚ÄúSoda Pop‚Äù</a> began and no one was losing their shit about the demon boy band Saja Boys, it became clear to me and my friend that we were the only ones who were really buying into what we paid for, and everyone else was mostly just there to see the movie. This is valid because for most of us, this was the first time any of us had seen the film on the big screen. That‚Äôs still a mind-boggling shame.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><span>Still, even with my lukewarm crowd, seeing the movie in a theater cemented how bonkers it is that Sony was so unsure about the movie‚Äìwhich has now become a cultural phenomenon and whose music has hit </span><a href="https://www.billboard.com/lists/huntrx-golden-kpop-demon-hunters-number-1-hot-100/"><span>#1 on the Billboard top 100</span></a><span>‚Äìthat it partnered with Netflix, who shouldered much of the film‚Äôs budget for exclusive rights to distribute it. Sony </span><a href="https://www.slashfilm.com/1941507/sony-made-netflix-kpop-demon-hunters-earnings/"><span>ensured it would make a profit</span></a><span> on </span><i><span>KPop Demon Hunters </span></i><span>through the deal, but lost out on what could have been an absolute cash cow for it down the line.</span></p> <p><span>Even after all the hype and the massive viewer numbers, the people behind the movie still seem to be underestimating it. The Alamo Drafthouses in New York City had four total singalong showings, two on Saturday, August 23, and two more on the following Sunday. Those predictably sold out within days, and by the time my group left our underwhelming screening, Alamo Drafthouse had added another half a dozen to the schedule.&nbsp;</span></p>

    <p><span>Because the gremlin in my brain is still singing this movie‚Äôs soundtrack, I put my Alamo Drafthouse membership to good use and decided to use it to go see the movie again the following day for no additional cost. Worst case scenario, I get to see a movie I really love on the big screen again. Best case scenario, I find a crowd that will match my freak. I picked a showing with more seats, thus statistically more likely to have sickos, but while it was marginally better, I still felt like most of the audience wasn‚Äôt buying in, and I didn‚Äôt even have my friend with me this time as a buffer. I still yelled ‚Äúfit check for my napalm era‚Äù and sang to myself in my seat, but with the exception of one young diva who not only sang every song but recited every line, it felt like the singalong event was mostly just another chance to see a movie the way it should have been seen in the first place. It‚Äôs a shame that I scroll through my feeds and see videos of the most hype crowds singing along at screenings elsewhere and get FOMO for an event I was literally in attendance for, but at least I got the transcendent experience of hearing <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ug_pv5-r1js">‚ÄúWhat It Sounds Like‚Äù</a> booming through the Drafthouse‚Äôs sound system.&nbsp;</span></p> <figure id="attachment_2000620029" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000620029"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000620029">¬© Netflix</figcaption></figure> <p><span>There was a guy sitting next to me at the second showing who told his friends he‚Äôd only seen the first half of the movie in passing, so he braved a singalong event to see the movie for the first time on the big screen. As much as I enjoyed watching </span><i><span>KPop Demon Hunters </span></i><span>on my laptop, I‚Äôm always going to envy his experience of seeing it for the first time in that environment. There‚Äôs an entire subplot in </span><i><span>KPop Demon Hunters </span></i><span>about Rumi, the half human/half demon lead singer, being told by her caretaker Celine that she must cover up her demonic patterns and hide who she is from the world, and even her best friends. No one could possibly understand, Celine says, and it‚Äôs better to be safe than sorry. That same unsure reservation is why </span><i><span>KPop Demon Hunters</span></i><span>‚Äô victory lap of finally getting to be on the big screen is happening months after it‚Äôs already etched itself on our culture as much more than a limited-time event. Much like Celine herself, maybe some people at Sony should have had more faith in what they were making. And maybe by the time the eventual sequel comes out, New York City‚Äôs moviegoers will step the fuck up and sing along next time.</span></p>
