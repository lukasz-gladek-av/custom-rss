There are a ton of things it changes, but some of the highlights are nerfs to Afterimage and instant Sparking mode skills, DP fights have capped health bar regeneration when a fighter is on standby, and 1v1 local multiplayer now lets you select from any stage, not just the Hyperbolic Time Chamber. </p><p>The Afterimage nerf is a big one. The skill doesn’t last as long now and is cancelled out if your opponent uses Perception. Whereas before it resulted in drawn out dodge battles, it’s now easier to counter. The instant Sparking mode is another major change: the new, increased Skill Count needed to deploy them means players are less likely to be able to spam Sparking mode back-to-back-to-back. DP battles where players go in with a roster of fighters should also move more quickly and smoothly since the recovery rate for constantly swapping them has been reduced (RIP to my OG Z warrior team that eked out wins by constantly tagging in and out). </p><p>The surprise update has so far been met with <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/SparkingZero/comments/1hcdl1m/the_juxtaposition_is_wild_lol/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/SparkingZero/comments/1hcdl1m/the_juxtaposition_is_wild_lol/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">near-universal praise on the the subreddit</a></span> where just days prior the community was apoplectic about the state of <em>Dragon Ball: Sparking Zero</em> and its future prospects for keeping fans engaged.

The results were incredibly faithful to the franchise, but a poor display for a game in 2024 whose main ongoing draw is its ranked mode. </p><p>The doom and gloom metastasized in part because Bandai Namco was tightlipped about <em>Dragon Ball: Sparking Zero</em>’s roadmap, with no real indication of what feedback it was monitoring or when players could expect fixes. After all the radio silence then, this week’s big update caught many fans by surprise. It turns out <em>Dragon Ball: Sparking Zero </em>will continue to get fixes, even if they don’t necessarily come at a clip players might expect from other bigger name fighting games like<em> Street Fighter VI</em> and<em> Tekken 8</em>.<br></p><p>Of course, there’s still more work to be done. Ranked mode remains far from balanced, and players have already spotted some pretty major bugs, like one apparent issue that lets players restore extra health to standby fighters in the last minute of a match. And <em>Dragon Ball: Sparking Zero</em>’s single-player content remains shallow and disappointing. It seems possible Bandai Namco could continue adding to that part of the game as well, though likely not for free. There’s already a big slate of paid DLC planned. </p><p>For now, though, fans can enjoy a new honeymoon phase with latest <em>Dragon Ball</em> game, including as they pick through the update for all of the possible stealth changes that aren’t even mentioned, like maybe making <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/SparkingZero/comments/1hcl7n8/did_goku_ssj3_get_bulkier/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/SparkingZero/comments/1hcl7n8/did_goku_ssj3_get_bulkier/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Super Saiyan 3 Goku’s arms a bit bigger</a></span>. </p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

To accompany this news, the <em>Pocket</em> devs have revealed a rather big surprise: there’s to be a new special set of Mew-themed packs called Mythical Island, arriving in the game on December 17.</p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="196165" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="What’s Coming Out Beyond Pokémon: The Indigo Disk | The Week In Games" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="95" data-playlist="196165,196663,197298" data-current="196165"><div><p>What’s Coming Out Beyond Pokémon: The Indigo Disk | The Week In Games</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196165/196165_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196165/196165_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196165/196165_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196165/196165_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/21711.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>It was widely expected that a new set would join (rather than replace, given the game’s so-far redundant “Select Expansion” page) the launch set, Genetic Apex, at the end of January, as this would follow the three-monthly cycle of the real-world version of the TCG. But I don’t think anyone was expecting a new “Themed Booster Pack” set before the end of the year. That’s the designation given to Mythical Island, which—and I’m speculating somewhat here with ambiguous information—appears to be a smaller “special set” (it’s coded “A1a”, to Genetic Apex’s “A1”), with just Mew pack art, that’ll throw some excellent spanners into the current meta.</p><p><em>Pocket</em> has so far featured just Genetic Apex, the unfortunately named set (everyone else sees it as the codename for a <em>Wolfenstein</em>-style enemy project, right?) that has featured Pikachu, Charizard and Mewtwo. While collecting the entire set <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/pokemon-tcg-pocket-hidden-cards-odds-wonder-pick-1851689974&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-tcg-pocket-hidden-cards-odds-wonder-pick-1851689974">would take you over a year</a></span> without paying astonishing amounts of money, it’s been around long enough now that most people have the cards to <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/pokemon-tcg-pocket-best-decks-mewtwo-charizard-1851696181&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-tcg-pocket-best-decks-mewtwo-charizard-1851696181">build the decks that are dominating the meta</a></span>. In fact, if you take part in the <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/pokemon-tcg-pocket-emblem-event-sp-1851716406&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-tcg-pocket-emblem-event-sp-1851716406">fun new Emblem Event</a></span>, you’ll almost inevitably face either the Mewtwo, Charizard, Blastoise or Pikachu decks, almost without variation. So what the game really needs is a bunch of new cards thrown in to explode all that.</p><p>So hooray for news of Mythical Island in less than a week. The trailer flashes a whole bunch of new cards, including of course a Mew ex, which has a single energy 20 damage attack, but then a very Ditto-like ability for three energy (and energy of <em>any</em> type, making this a strong addition to any deck) called Genome Hacking. This lets you “choose 1 of your opponent’s Active Pokémon’s attacks and use it as this attack.”</p><p>However, I think the real game-changer is going to be an Aerodactyl ex that has an Ability to prevent your opponent from evolving their Active Pokémon. Given how much of the meta is based around such a move, this should shake things up! Better get used to evolving on the bench.</p><figure id="" data-id="4076bda49ed705f824db09785f24ab03" data-recommend-id="image://4076bda49ed705f824db09785f24ab03" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A series of Pokémon cards from the Mythical Island set." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A series of Pokémon cards from the Mythical Island set." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->The Pokémon Company / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="4076bda49ed705f824db09785f24ab03" data-recommend-id="image://4076bda49ed705f824db09785f24ab03" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A series of Pokémon cards from the Mythical Island set." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Also briefly glimpsed is a Vaporeon special art with a new Ability to transfer water energy between cards, and gorgeous special arts for Dedenne and Marshadow.</p><p>There are new Trainers, too, including Blue, who will reduce all incoming damage for a turn by 10 points, and Leaf who’ll really mess everything up by reducing retreat costs on your Active Pokémon by <em>two</em>. X Speed, step aside.</p><p>It’s hard to know if the set is very tiny, and just has the two ex cards and the two new Trainers, or if the trailer is being very selective in what it shows—infuriatingly, these <em>Pocket</em> cards don’t have the traditional numbering that shows you a set’s size.

But perhaps the most interesting reveal is the “Canon Mode,” designed to appease players who are concerned about the game’s branching storylines, given the series’ focus on synchronizing with the past.</p><p>“Choices come more into play when recruiting allies and romance [sic] some of the characters,” said Jonathan Dumont, the director on <em>Shadows</em>. “Since the fan base is divided on branching dialogues, we have incorporated an option called CANON MODE which allows you to play the game with choices already made for you, to give you a choice free experience.” Elsewhere in the thread Dumont adds, “You will still be able to switch characters in [the] open in this mode.”</p><p>This news was met with delight by those taking part in the AMA. “Wait, WHAT??? Are you serious? That’s basically what the fanbase has been asking for since 2018,” said one person. “Oh my god, amazing,” replied another. A third suggested, “Wild pitch: retroactively add this mode to <em>Odyssey</em> and <em>Valhalla</em>.”</p><figure id="" data-id="0f054038f8cb7a853b5feaa9adccb21d" data-recommend-id="image://0f054038f8cb7a853b5feaa9adccb21d" data-format="jpg" data-width="1435" data-height="807" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The choice screen for playing as Yasuke or Naoe." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="The choice screen for playing as Yasuke or Naoe." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Ubisoft</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="0f054038f8cb7a853b5feaa9adccb21d" data-recommend-id="image://0f054038f8cb7a853b5feaa9adccb21d" data-format="jpg" data-width="1435" data-height="807" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The choice screen for playing as Yasuke or Naoe." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>While there are some very loud voices that strongly believe all games should only be playable in their hardest modes, back in real life everyone approaches games very differently. Some seek super-hard, reflex-heavy combat, and want to be told the story by a fixed narrator, while others love to become embroiled in a twisting narrative on which they have huge influence but want to walk away at the sight of a boss fight. And indeed, everything in-between, outside of that, and the whole lot combined.</p><p>Ubisoft has been making some big strides in the games it <em>does</em> release regarding letting players structure a game according to their own tastes, and while it’s fair to say the publisher has led the way in this regard, many others are now following. Where once we were lucky to choose between Easy, Normal and Hard, it’s becoming more commonplace to let a player tweak specific aspects of their $70 purchase, creating the tone of game that best suits their desires. (We’re edging closer and closer to my <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/assassins-creed-origins-tourism-difficulty&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/assassins-creed-origins-tourism-difficulty" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">skippable boss fight future</a></span>.)</p><p>It seems yet another step in this direction to offer an option to those who simply don’t want to make narrative choices for whatever reason. There are many <em>Assassin’s Creed</em> die-hards who want a single, pure storyline, to make sense of the game’s reliving history through memory, and find the player-driven deviations, well, deviant. For others it could be choice paralysis—that awful fear that you might be picking the “wrong” option, and then worrying about that instead of enjoying the game.
