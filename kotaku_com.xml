              <p><span>During the best of times, </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/dragon-age-veilguard-mass-effect-n7-day-armor-location-1851692131"><span>N7 Day</span></a><span> is BioWare’s annual </span><i><span>Mass Effect </span></i><span>celebration. Sometimes the studio teases what’s to come in its science fiction universe with </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/mass-effect-teaser-n7-day-andromeda-1850999958"><span>concept art or cinematic trailers</span></a><span>, but this year sounds like it’s going to be a bit quieter. If you’ve been paying attention to all the turmoil </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/mass-effect-5-bioware-dragon-age-veilguard-dlc-layoffs-1851750767"><span>at the studio in recent years</span></a><span>, that’s probably not surprising, but BioWare is assuring fans that </span><i><span>Mass Effect 5 </span></i><span>is still in development and is the studio’s primary focus.</span></p> <p><span>In a </span><a href="https://blog.bioware.com/2025/11/07/n7-day-2025/"><span>post on the studio’s blog</span></a><span>, </span><i><span>Mass Effect </span></i><span>executive producer Mike Gamble addressed fans, more or less telling them the team doesn’t have much to show this November 7. I guess that’s what happens sometimes when you make an official community day; even when you’re not in a place to show something off, you’ve gotta say something publicly.</span></p>

 <p><span>“Like you, we’ve heard the rumors lately,” Gamble writes. “You’ve made it clear you care deeply about what’s next. So let’s start by setting the record straight: the next </span><i><span>Mass Effect</span></i><span> game is in development, and EA and BioWare remain committed to telling more stories in this universe.</span></p>

 <p><span>“The truth is, the last few years have been an incredibly busy time at BioWare. But currently, the team is heads-down and focused exclusively on </span><i><span>Mass Effect</span></i><span>. We have a lot of universe to cover, lots of features to build, and lots of romances to figure out. We’re excited by what we’re building, and we promise you: when we’re ready, it’ll be a lot of fun to show. Until then, thank you for your patience because y’all are thirsty for news and I see you looking for secret meaning in my tweets (okay, sometimes they have secret meaning).”</span></p>

 <p><span>However, despite Gamble’s suggestion that the team may not have much to show off for some time, there might be some more substantial teases coming. The blog post has a bunch of random italicized letters that, when isolated, spell “url krogan.” Krogan are one of the alien species in the </span><i><span>Mass Effect </span></i><span>universe, but it’s unclear at this point what this might be teasing. No doubt fans will be working to piece things together as the day goes on.</span></p>

 <p><span>Beyond the next game, Gamble does confirm something significant about another </span><i><span>Mass Effect </span></i><span>project: the </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/mass-effect-tv-show-movie-amazon-live-action-fallout-1851692186"><span>Amazon TV adaptation</span></a><span>. After rumors and speculation circulated on the internet that the show might be a retread of the original trilogy’s story, Gamble confirmed that it won’t be, </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/mass-effect-show-amazon-casting-characters-shepard-2000626536"><span>and thank god for that</span></a><span>.</span></p>

 <p><span>“The writers room is going strong, and we’ve got a lot figured out about how it fits within the </span><i><span>Mass Effect </span></i><span>canon, and where it sits in respect to the new game,” Gamble writes. “The show will explore a brand-new story within the universe’s timeline, and will be set after the original trilogy. It won’t be a retread of Commander Shepard’s story – because after all … that’s YOUR story, isn’t it?”</span></p> <p><i><span>Mass Effect </span></i><span>development may be ongoing, but BioWare’s pivot into a one-game studio after EA made drastic cuts to the company’s staff means that </span><i><span>Dragon Age </span></i><span>is likely in limbo. </span><i><span>The Veilguard </span></i><span>ended with a cliffhanger </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/dragon-age-veilguard-secret-ending-executors-loghain-1851700436"><span>in its post-credits scene</span></a><span>, but </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/dragon-age-the-veilguard-bioware-layoffs-mass-effect-1851784416"><span>much of the talent behind that series has been scattered</span></a><span> across other EA studios or left the company entirely. </span></p>

              <p>How come<a href="https://kotaku.com/red-dead-redemption-2-the-kotaku-review-1829984369"><em> Red Dead Redemption 2</em></a> still isn’t on current-gen consoles? Why did Konami drop its lawsuit against the anime horse game? How many players will be humiliated by Ned Flanders before the <em>Simpsons Fortnite</em> season is over? It’s another edition of Morning Checkpoint, <em>Kotaku</em>‘s daily roundup of gaming news and culture. <em>Call of Duty</em> is just a week away. We’ll find out how many people still care or if they’re still too busy recovering from their<em> Battlefield 6</em> and<em> Arc Raiders</em> hangovers.</p> <h2><em>Red Dead Redemption 2</em> is now the fourth best-selling game of all time</h2> <p>That’s another big win for meticulously rendered horse testicles and proof that painstaking craftmanship can propel your game to the top of the charts even if it’s long, often boring, and essentially feels like the Ken Burns documentary of open-world action games. Take-Two confirmed in its latest earnings report that <em>Red Dead Redemption 2</em> has now sold over 79 million units, <a href="https://kotaku.com/switch-2-sales-mario-kart-world-mk8-2000620694">pushing <em>Mario Kart 8</em> <em>Deluxe</em></a> into fifth place.</p>

 <p>But the game also goes on sale for just $20 a lot, whereas <em>Mario Kart 8</em> is rarely below full price. Take-Two says it’s still the top-selling game of the last seven years in the U.S. in terms of dollar sales. So, we’re getting <a href="https://kotaku.com/read-dead-redemption-2-nintendo-switch-port-rating-1850873886">that rumored Switch 2 and PS5 port</a> any day now, right? right??</p>

 <h2>Square Enix hit with mass layoffs</h2> <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/final-fantasy-gen-ai-square-enix-qa-bugs-2000641688">The <em>Final Fantasy</em> publisher</a> has reportedly fired 140 people across its overseas publishing operations, <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/square-enix-announces-more-layoffs-as-part-of-us-and-europe-restructuring/"><em>VGC</em> reports</a>. The company says the move will save around $20 million as it continues overhauling its gaming business after years of misfires.</p>

 <h2>Ned Flanders has killed over 33,000 <em>Fortnite</em> players</h2> <p>The friendly <a href="https://kotaku.com/fortnite-simpsons-mini-season-review-changes-new-map-short-2000640868"><em>Simpsons</em> neighbor</a> is anything but when he’s roaming the map as a deadly NPC.

            <link>https://kotaku.com/ug-gorilla-tag-vr-meta-quest-mammothor-chomamasaur-2000642046</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/forget-gorilla-tag-the-kids-have-moved-on-to-the-next-big-vr-phenomenon.1347088/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>To you or me, VR gaming may have quietly died away a few years back, after everyone played&nbsp;<em>Half-Life: Alyx</em> and had their fill of&nbsp;<em>Beat Saber</em>. But to the mysterious collective known as Gen Alpha, the format is alive and well and occupying everything. At the beginning of this year <a href="https://kotaku.com/gorilla-tag-vr-meta-quest-steamvr-free-ghosts-lucy-pbbv-1851741139">we told you about&nbsp;<em>Gorilla Tag</em></a> and its massive audience who were all simultaneously under the shared delusion that the game is haunted. But that’s old hat now, because now we have a new game you’ve almost certainly never heard of with a colossal audience: the mighty <em>UG</em>.</p> <p><em>UG</em>&nbsp;bears a lot of similarities with&nbsp;<em>G-Tag</em>, but it’s not nearly as brazen a copy as it might first appear. The older game is all about being a gorilla, and—well—playing tag. It’s a lot more involved than that, not least because of all the bloody in-app cosmetic purchases, but the key thing is that it’s a game that brilliantly understood how to make free first-person movement work in a VR game without causing nausea or discombobulating incongruence. The trick is to make the player avatar into a creature with two long arms, but no legs, propelled around by the instinctive action of pulling yourself along the ground. This works for climbing and bouncing too, resulting in a way to navigate the large, vertically interesting levels as an ape. <em>UG</em>, rather smartly, just copies this wholesale. Except here (even though everyone just looks like gorillas wearing thongs), you’re playing as a bizarro-world caveman, co-existing with dinosaurs who can be hatched from eggs, raised, saddled, and ridden upon. But most importantly: swapped.</p>

  <p>My window into this peculiar world is my now 11-year-old son, for whom we bought a Meta Quest 3A last Christmas. He’s an only child, and it seemed like a great way for him to play active games with his friends even when he’s at home. And it is! Damn, the muscles he’s built flinging his body around as he plays&nbsp;<em>Gorilla Tag</em> rather put pay to all those tiresome complaints about gaming making kids sedentary. After nearly a year of on-and-off phases of playing the game, about three weeks ago a <em>G-Tag</em> playing friend told him he needed to install something new, called <em>UG</em>, and to do it with some matter of urgency. However, because every electronic item he owns is locked down to the point of being brick-like without my permissions, he then came begging to me. I checked it over, thought it looked like yet another <em>Gorilla Tag</em> knock-off he’d bounce off in a couple of days like all the others, but given it was free, I said sure.</p>

 <p>Our lives are now very much about prying him free of his headset for brief moments in which he’s not attempting to feed chickens to an ever-growing menagerie of dinosaurs. For him and squillions of kids around the world, <em>UG</em> has become a big deal.</p>

 <figure id="attachment_2000642107" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000642107"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000642107">© ContinuumXR / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p>Quite why is really very fascinating to me, a dad looking on in bemusement (often directly, via the mobile app, where I’m instructed to cast his game to my phone so I can see the new additions to his prehistoric collection). Because while <em>Gorilla Tag</em> has a central game around which everything else is built (tag),&nbsp;<em>UG</em> does not. It’s instead a similarly designed series of large, open spaces, where players can take dinos they’ve collected to help them level up by feeding them food. Right now this food is either comically prehistoric-looking chickens or pigs, which you hold in front of your dinosaur’s foot to have it magically pop into cooked ribs and drumsticks (yes, chicken ribs and pork drumsticks), which you then feed to the beast’s mouth. As it eats its gains XP, and at level 5 will have a sudden growth spurt and become large enough to “buy” a saddle for (with in-game Bones), and then you can ride it around as your mount. There are large dinosaur bosses to fight, with very small chances of a victory seeing an egg drop as loot, but that’s about it. This is, instead, all about the trading.</p>

 <p>I should mention, there very much are in-app purchases for both cosmetics and special versions of the imaginary dinosaurs that inhabit the game, and this sucks big-time. We’ve had full-on rows over my son’s belief that $30 is a very reasonable price for a bundle, because bought separately they’d cost so much more. “THEY’RE PICTURES THAT DON’T COST <em>ANYTHING </em>TO MAKE!” I’ve yelled in exasperation, waving my arms around and adding things like, “YOU’RE TRYING TO SPEND TWENTY-FIVE POUNDS ON DRAWINGS THAT DON’T EVEN EXIST!” I don’t understand. I’m an old fool who just doesn’t get it. And it’s his money, so how is it any of my business! And so on. But that aside, there are various ways to get your own dinosaurs without paying, primary among them swapping something you have for something someone else has.</p>

 <p>To this end, the game’s main hub area has trading tables on which players can place up to five creatures they’re willing to exchange, and then each pulls a lever to seal the deal. And watching this is&nbsp;<em>extraordinary</em>. Imagine the trading floor of a financial market, but with pre-pubescent voices. It’s frantic and furious, with stakes constantly being raised as multiple people on the server start trying to outbid a player for their especially interestingly patterned version of a Grugadon. And often, this is before the kid has even suggested they’re interested in trading, just happening to have stomped by while riding their proudest dino. My son has often had to escape to a private instance (you dial a random four-digit code into a machine to do this) to get away from marauding crowds trying to scream over each other for his electric-blue Triskeletops.</p>

 <figure id="attachment_2000642108" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000642108"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000642108">© ContinuumXR / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p>The game also demonstrates plenty of the peculiar conspiratorial nonsense that pervades&nbsp;<em>Gorilla Tag</em>. Because, guys, have you heard, Mammothors are getting deleted tomorrow? No, seriously, they’re pulling them from the game. You see, this admin leaked them before he was supposed to, and now they’re taking them all out of the game. This was the BIG story the week before last, and I’d hear kids talking about it (a weird thing about the Meta Quest headset is you can hear everything if you’re in the same room, but they can’t hear you when you mock them from the couch) no matter how many different servers my kid was on. Via the magic of checking the Discord (that just recently celebrated 100,000 members), I discovered that absolutely no dinosaurs are being deleted (clearly the rumors had spread far enough that there was a need to publicly respond), and then hilariously enough, come November’s post-Halloween update, Mammothors have become the focus. Every nonsensical memetic belief seems to be based around these spurious “admins,” not least the wild theories that everyone seems to believe about “duping,” based on a bug that was eliminated from the game over a month before. It’s fascinating to observe how these rumors evolve and spread, formed from nothing at all, and how hard it can be to dispel any one of these beliefs.</p> <p>But as inaccessibly weird as it all appears to me, there is a vast audience out there, and it’s growing fast. There have been an awful lot of attempts to muscle in on the success of <em>Gorilla Tag</em> in the three years since it released, perhaps most successfully by an extremely similar game called&nbsp;<em>Animal Company&nbsp;</em>that, earlier this year, became the most popular game on the Meta store. But most others come and go as the obvious knock-offs they are. <em>UG</em> is doing something different, however. It’s been sitting at the top of the Meta charts for weeks now, and while the perennial hit <em>Beat Saber</em> still sits in second, it’s&nbsp;<em>Animal Company</em> that’s third, while <em>Gorilla Tag</em> has been dethroned to fourth place. This really seems to suggest the caveman game is siphoning players directly from <em>G-Tag</em>‘s audience. It’s interesting to note that 2022’s gorilla game has amassed 164,000 ratings over the last three years, while <em>UG</em> already has acquired 163,000 in just the three months since it released.</p> <p>But these games have mercurial audiences, and at any moment&nbsp;<em>UG</em> could become last month’s thing, forgotten in the pile of free-to-play games inside the headset, as everyone moves on to the next near-identical game. And we, the people who think we’re the normal game players, will likely not even know any of it is happening.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Online PvPvE survival extraction shooter <a href="https://kotaku.com/arc-raiders-tips-solo-group-recycle-free-loadout-2000641174"><em>Arc Raiders</em> is very good</a>. But since launching last month, players have started to grow frustrated with the paid multiplayer game’s pricey cosmetics. And a silly helmet for a chicken is perhaps the best example of how paid skins and cosmetics can go oh so wrong, even in otherwise great games.</p> <p>On November 6, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ArcRaiders/comments/1oq8xpx/charging_10_for_a_chicken_helmet_that_you_only/">a post about a new cosmetic item for a chicken exploded in popularity on the <em>Arc Raiders</em>‘ subreddit</a>. In the game, each player has a chicken named <a href="https://arcraiders.wiki/wiki/Scrappy">Scrappy</a> who periodically provides them with random resources between matches. This chicken can only be seen in one menu of <em>Arc Raiders</em>, and yet, developer Embark has already created at least two different paid cosmetic looks for Scrappy. The newest chicken skin for sale is an old-fashioned diving helmet. This helmet alone costs 700 Raider Tokens, which translates to about $7, though due to the way the currency is sold in bundles, you’ll have to spend $10 to get that many tokens. The post about the helmet reached over 7k upvotes by Friday.</p>

   <p>Reaction to the helmet is a bit all over the place. Some players think it’s very dumb, but don’t mind because it doesn’t affect the game. Others feel like Embark is being greedy for charging so much for something that players will rarely see. There’s also a lot of confusion over why the cosmetics in <em>Arc Raiders</em> are so expensive. Keep in mind this isn’t a free-to-play game like <em>Fortnite</em>. To play <em>Arc Raiders</em>, you gotta spend $40. Some players assumed the fact that it’s a game you buy would shield it from free-to-play cosmetic guff, but this chicken helmet has made it clear that won’t be the case.</p>

 <p>“I understand this is a live service game, being supported for 10 years. But this is a bit ridiculous,” <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ArcRaiders/comments/1oq8xpx/comment/nnhcsdy/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button">said one user.</a> “Considering half the skins aren’t even a different base model and are priced half the cost of the damn game. It’s okay to speak up about these things, because ultimately greed destroys companies — even if just silly cosmetics.”</p>

   <p>That’s the other problem with this new chicken helmet. While it can be bought separately, it is also included in a cosmetic bundle that features an outfit for your in-game character. However, a lot of players noticed that this “new” skin looks nearly identical to a previously sold cosmetic outfit. This has led to some players claiming that Embark has done a mere palette swap and is charging players roughly $15 for the privilege of buying a similar skin all over again.</p> <p>I doubt these pricey and somewhat ugly skins and items will sink<em> Arc Raiders</em> anytime soon. The game is one of the most-played titles on Steam right now and shows no sign of slowing down. But these expensive cosmetics are a reminder that, somehow, <a href="https://kotaku.com/20-10-skins-expensive-microtransactions-halo-diablo-4-1851008769">we are truly in an era where a $15 to $20 skin is not just common</a>, but something most players seem to ignore or even accept. Just a few of these skins add up to the total price of <em>Arc Raiders</em>, which is wild. But if people are buying them… well.</p>

              <p>Almost nobody buys $4,000 laptops. They’re amazing on paper, sure, but they’re also out of reach for most people. That’s why <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5391/">when Dell’s Inspiron 16 laptop (1TB SSD, 32GB DDR5 RAM) suddenly drops to $999 from its regular $3,999 price</a>, it makes noise. You’re getting a powerful machine at a quarter of its usual price which is why this deal (freshly posted on Amazon for Black Friday) isn’t likely to last long.</p>

<h2>A Serious Laptop for Real Work and Play</h2>
<p>This laptop isn’t a lightweight in any sense other than how easy it is to carry: It’s designed to <strong>crush productivity tasks</strong> while staying flexible enough for entertainment, content creation or business use. At its core, you’ll find <strong>Intel’s new Core 7 150U processor</strong> which runs up to 5.4GHz with 10 cores and 12 threads. That’s a lot of power for something you can carry around all day, and you can feel it in how it handles demanding workloads or 4K streaming with zero slowdown. Paired with integrated Intel graphics, it provides a smooth experience without draining your battery too fast.</p>



<p>Dell gave this model the specs to back up that performance promise: You get <strong>32GB of high-speed DDR5 RAM</strong> to keep things running smoothly like editing video, compiling data, and jumping on a video call-all at the same time. Plus,<strong> 1TB of lightning-fast SSD storage</strong> means your laptop boots instantly, and apps open in seconds. There’s no noise, no lag, and minimal heat.</p>
<p>For one, the design itself looks and feels premium. The <strong>screen is a 16-inch touchscreen with Full HD+ resolution</strong>, supported by IPS and WVA technology, meaning users will get more vivid colors and wider viewing angles ideal for either presentation work or creative sketching. With 300 nits of brightness and anti-glare protection, you can confidently work in bright cafes or by a window without any reflections getting in the way.</p>



<p>Connectivity is another area where this laptop doesn’t compromise. It comes with all the right modern ports — USB-C, HDMI, Wi-Fi 6E, and Bluetooth 5.3 — which means pairing devices or hooking up monitors is fast and painless. The HD webcam and noise-canceling microphones make every virtual call sharper and more professional, while the backlit keyboard keeps late-night typing sessions comfortable.</p>
<p>For its class, battery life holds up solidly enough that getting through a full workday or cross-country flight without scrambling for an outlet is quite achievable. It comes with <strong>Windows 11 Pro installed by default</strong> and keeps the system stable and secure-a nice touch for those who rely on their machine daily for professional use.</p>
<p>It isn’t shy about discounts, though: Amazon has now dropped this Dell Laptop to an all-time low of $999 for Black Friday, a full 75% off its usual price. Black Friday deals this deep don’t stay live for long and this one might vanish as quickly as it appeared.</p>

              <p>There’s something addictive about smart displays once you start using one: You can check the weather, set alarms, play your favorite playlists, video call friends or peek into your connected cameras-all with a quick voice command. The Amazon Echo Show 5 nails that balance between screen and speaker and makes it one of the easiest smart home upgrades you can get. Now<a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5390/"> it’s dropped to a record low of $59, down from its regular $89 price</a> which makes jumping into the Alexa ecosystem even more tempting.</p>

<h2>More Than a Smart Display</h2>
<p>Amazon designed the Echo Show 5 to do everything your old smart speaker can’t: The <strong>5.5-inch display may sound small, but it’s key to transforming how you interact with your assistant</strong>. You can glance at the time, watch your favorite Prime Video series, follow step-by-step recipes or see who’s at the door when paired with compatible cameras. It’s like having an assistant that also gives you context-perfect for those times when hearing isn’t enough.</p>



<p>This generation takes the experience up a notch: The sound is clearer, with twice the bass of older models, meaning your playlists and podcasts actually sound like something worth playing out loud. You can stream directly from Amazon Music, Spotify or any connected app with a nice balance between rich low tones and crisp vocals. And when it’s sitting idle, the screen doubles as a digital photo frame. You can set it to display your favorite pictures or even invite family members to share their own directly to your device. It includes <strong>unlimited cloud photo storage for Prime members</strong>, so it’s as much of a family hub as it is a gadget.</p>



<p>Then there is the way it doubles as your <strong>smart home control center</strong>: You can dim the lights, turn up the thermostat, or get a glimpse of what’s happening on the security feed-all with your voice or a tap. If you have compatible Ring doorbells and cameras, you’ll be able to view real-time footage right from the display. Alexa routines can automate your mornings, too: wake up to gradual light, a daily news briefing, and a playlist softly fading in before breakfast.</p>
<p>With Amazon, privacy remains front and center here. The Echo Show 5 incorporates several layers of protection such as a physical camera shutter and a microphone/camera off button. It is up to you when it’s listening and when it is not. The 2MP camera keeps you in touch through video calls using the Alexa app or another Echo device. It serves as a quick way to check up on family or roommates without opening up your phone.</p>
<p>Amazon is officially returning the Echo Show 5 to its all-time low price of $59 for this early Black Friday deal.</p>
