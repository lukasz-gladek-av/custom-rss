            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>It’s been less than a week since Larian Studios <a href="https://kotaku.com/divinity-original-sin-3-rpg-trailer-larian-bg4-game-awards-2000652714">revealed <em>Divinity</em></a>. Fans have spent much of that time <a href="https://kotaku.com/divinity-larian-trailer-turn-based-rpg-release-date-2000653105">debating whether it would be an action-RPG</a>.&nbsp;While much of the new game remains mysterious, studio head Swen Vincke isn’t trying to keep that part a secret. He recently confirmed it will indeed be a turn-based game like its other recent hits, including <a href="https://kotaku.com/baldurs-gate-3-bg3-review-dungeons-dragons-rpg-larian-1850726491"><em>Baldur’s Gate 3</em></a>. Except he’s also promising it will be “way better” than the 2023<em> Dungeons &amp; Dragons</em>-based Game of the Year winner.</p> <p>“<em>Baldur’s Gate 3</em> was a good game and I’m proud of it, but I think this one is going to be way better,” Vincke <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2025-12-16/-baldur-s-gate-3-maker-promises-divinity-will-be-next-level">told <em>Bloomberg</em></a> this week. One challenge during&nbsp;<em>BG3</em>‘s development <a href="https://kotaku.com/baldurs-gate-3-dnd-races-classes-hours-ps5-xbox-pc-1850590383">was taking the existing ruleset</a> for Wizards of the Coast’s pen-and-paper RPG and adapting it to a video game. “Here, we’re making a system that’s made for a video game. It’s much easier to understand,” he explained.</p>

 <p>Considering <em>BG3</em> is already one of the most beloved games of the last decade, surpassing it will be a tall order, but the veteran developer doesn’t seem worried. “[<em>Divinity</em>] is going to be us unleashed, I think,” Vincke said. “It’s a turn-based RPG featuring everything you’ve seen from us in the past, but it’s brought to the next level.”</p>

 <p>That “next level” includes growing development resources spread across a larger number of studios that will allow the team to make more of the game in parallel, <em>Bloomberg</em> reports. Ideally, that should cut down on the development time. Vincke said Larian is aiming for three to four years with <em>Divinity</em>, rather than the six it took to make <em>BG3</em>. It will still start in Early Access, however, and won’t be arriving anytime in 2026.</p> <p>Where will this new level of investment show up? More cinematic scenes and narrative experiments. In other words, the parts of <em>BG3</em> fans loved the most. “We’re doing a couple of things that you haven’t seen in RPGs before, I think,” the Larian cofounder said. I hope <em>Divinity</em> delivers.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Samsung unveiled its Galaxy Watch 8 earlier this year, at a not-so-friendly, but quite justifiable retail price of $350. If you’ve been wanting to upgrade but the high price tag has been holding you back, we bring good news.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6419/">Thanks to Amazon, you can now snap it up for just $250, after the retailer quite generously took a massive $100 off it</a>. The deal is open to both Prime and non-Prime members, and you’ll even get free shipping with your purchase, which means $250 is quite literally all you’ve got to pay. The deal applies to the graphite and silver color options. Additionally, Amazon is also offering a free two-month Audible trial with your purchase, which is a service that lets you buy and stream audiobooks, podcasts, and audio shows.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6419/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Blend of Fitness and Health Features</h2>
<p>At first glance, the watch looks quite similar to its predecessor, but that isn’t really the case. It features a sleek, thinner-than-ever silhouette and offers a snug fit with a sporty style. The screen is both spacious and bright, letting you view your stats, check notifications, keep an eye on the latest news, and more, comfortably throughout the day. The interface has improved, too, so using the thing is going to feel more effortless than ever.</p>
<p>Watch 8 comes packed with a range of health and fitness features. We’re talking Vascular Load monitoring that monitors your stress levels, plus an antioxidant index that uses BioActive Sensor to measure carotenoid levels in your skin. When worn at night, the watch tracks how well you sleep at night, and offers Advanced Sleep Coaching to provide you with tips and insights that can help you rest better. Based on your performance/energy levels of the previous day, it even creates a personalized Energy Score with the help of Galaxy AI. This score lets you see how ready your body is for the upcoming challenges, which you can take into consideration while planning stuff for the day. For instance, a score over 85 indicates you’re well-rested, making it an ideal day to take on the tasks you’ve been putting off. A lower score suggests you need rest, so it might be a good idea to skip an intense workout that day.</p>



<p>Fitness-wise, the watch tracks your steps and comes with a Running Coach that monitors your performance and gives you real-time feedback. There are a bunch of fitness programs built right in, which you can follow to train better. As for the battery, the life depends on how you’re using the watch, but you can expect it to last around 1-2 days. What’s more, Google Gemini integration brings an efficient AI assistant right to your wrist. You can use it to find quick answers, brainstorm ideas, get help with replies, and a lot more.</p>
<p>Connecting it to your smartphone via Bluetooth gets you all your important notifications right on the app. You can check emails or messages, plus manage music without pulling your phone out.</p>
<p>In short, if you’ve been wanting to grab the latest Samsung Galaxy Watch 8, now is a great time to make the move. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6419/">This deal lets you grab it at a nice $100 discount, for just $250.</a> There are two color options to choose from, and multiple band sizes available.</p>

              <p>It looks like the wait for&nbsp;<em>Dead Island 3</em> won’t be&nbsp;<em>quite</em> as long as that between&nbsp;<em>Dead Island</em>s <em>1</em> and <em>2</em>. Dambuster Studios, the team that took over development of the second mainline entry in the sprawling zombie series, remains at the helm for the follow-up, aiming for a 2028 release.</p> <p>As detailed <a href="https://x.com/bogorad222/status/2000827597106896907">by Timur222 on X</a>, Dambuster’s latest financial statements state that the UK-based subsidiary of Deep Silver (and thus Embracer) has moved straight on from 2024’s release of&nbsp;<em>Dead Island 2: Ultimate Edition</em> to working on the direct follow-up as its “primary focus.” Right now all developers are working on the game, while those in QA will be moving over too, once Luna and Mac versions of <em>DI2U&nbsp;</em>are out the door. The details state that “feature, character, world and story design” are all “moving at pace,” all with a view to releasing in the first half of 2028.</p>

 <p>The original&nbsp;<em>Dead Island</em> appeared in 2011, developed by Polish team Techland, and despite being a solid zombie first-person action-RPG, arrived in a mess of mistakes and controversies. Chief among them was the <a href="https://kotaku.com/this-games-special-edition-comes-with-a-statue-of-a-bik-5976075">severed torso statue of a bikini-clad woman</a> included in the game’s special edition, but <a href="https://kotaku.com/whoops-you-might-be-playing-an-unfinished-version-of-d-5837480">releasing the internal development build onto Steam</a> instead of the final game on launch didn’t really help. Still, once fixed, it was fun—nothing exceptional, but fun.</p>

 <p>Techland followed it up two years later with a standalone expansion (remember when we called those “expandalones” for a minute?),&nbsp;<em>Dead Island: Riptide</em>, but had a cooler reception given it repeated so many of the things that held the first game back from being great. There then came a crappy spin-off called&nbsp;<em>Escape Dead Island</em>, a rapidly abandoned MOBA called <em>Dead Island: Epidemic</em>, a remastering of the original, and a canned mobile spin-off that never saw a release. At the same time, Techland opted out of making&nbsp;<em>Dead Island 2</em>, instead moving on to much greater success with&nbsp;<em>Dying Light</em>, meaning Deep Silver had to find a new studio. That was German team Yager Development, best known for <em>Spec Ops: The Line</em>, with an expected 2015 release. It didn’t go well.</p>

 <p>By July 2015, Deep Silver announced they’d taken the game back off Yager and handed it to UK studio Sumo Digital (<em>Crackdown 3</em>,&nbsp;<em>Team Sonic Racing</em>), issuing annual proof-of-life statements for the project until 2019 when it was declared that it had changed developers yet again. That time it went to another UK team, Dambuster (formed from the ashes of the collapse of Crytek UK), and in 2023 it was <em>finally</em> released, some eight years later than originally intended. It was fine!</p> <p>It also sold well enough to justify continuing on, and we now know that Dambuster has been working on the third mainline entry since it shipped the remaster of the sequel. For what it’s worth, the financial report <a href="https://find-and-update.company-information.service.gov.uk/company/09140280/filing-history">filed in the UK</a> also shows that the 194-person-strong company made a profit in 2024, and is sitting on assets of over £2 million. Dambuster is owned by Deep Silver, which is owned by Plaion, which is owned by Embracer, which is owned by Cthulhu.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>For those who love to stay active in the great outdoors—whether running, swimming, cycling, hiking, or really any workout you can do outside of four walls and a ceiling—the Galaxy Watch Ultra is the ultimate companion for your wrist. Designed with fitness enthusiasts in mind, it offers a rugged build and supports a wide range of activities to help you track your fitness progress. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6412/">This outdoor-ready smartwatch is currently available at a 23% discount, dropping from its original price of $650 to a more affordable $500 during this holiday season.</a></p>
<p>When we’ve written about this watch previously, it’s discount has usually come with the caveat of needing to trade-in an old watch. Not this time though. You can just save $150 without departing with any of your current tech.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6412/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Rugged Titanium Build</h2>
<p>The Galaxy Watch Ultra boasts a durable 47mm titanium face that can withstand impacts, bumps, and the rigors of outdoor activities. This tough design ensures it stands up to the elements while maintaining a sleek appearance. The titanium comes in a few color options—titanium gray, titanium white, titanium blue, and titanium silver—so you can choose one that best suits your style. The watch also offers several band choices, including a synthetic Peakform band, and a fabric-based trail band, a more robust marine band. Though, all options for this listing come exclusively with the marine band. I’m personally a big fan of the titanium gray variant as that one’s included band is a sleek orange.</p>
<p>Along with tracking your workouts, the Galaxy Watch Ultra is able to monitor your overall health. the watch tracks your sleep and daily energy levels, providing a “physical readiness” score based on factors like the quality of your sleep, heart rate, and step count.</p>
<p>The heart rate tracking is exceptionally accurate. Powered by Galaxy AI, the watch can filter out unnecessary physical movements, allowing it to deliver more precise heart rate data to help you fine-tune your workouts for better results.</p>



<p>For an added bonus, the watch gives personalized wellness tips, offering insights based on your daily activities, sleep patterns, and heart health that can help you optimize your well-being.</p>
<p>The Galaxy Watch Ultra’s battery can go for up to 60 hours on a single charge, meaning you won’t have to worry about running out of juice before your next workout. This extended battery life is particularly useful for sleep tracking. While many other smartwatches struggle to last&nbsp; a full day, night time becomes when you might want to charge it. With those, you never end up getting to utilize the sleep features. The Galaxy Watch Ultra only needs to charge every few days you can still use it to track your sleep throughout the night. The watch can even detect potential sleep apnea.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6412/">Normally priced at $650, the Galaxy Watch Ultra is now available at a significant 23% discount.</a> Save yourself $150 as you bring the price down to $500. Whether you’re a seasoned athlete or just looking for a tough and reliable fitness watch, the Galaxy Watch Ultra is a perfect choice. Makes for a great gift for the fitness freaks in your life this holiday season.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Samsung Drops Its microSD Card Below $0.13 per GB for Holidays, the Cheapest Nintendo Switch Storage Upgrade]]></title>
            <link>https://kotaku.com/samsung-drops-its-microsd-card-below-0-13-per-gb-for-holidays-the-cheapest-nintendo-switch-storage-upgrade-2000653790</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Storage issues are common, but also avoidable. If you’re running out of storage on your Nintendo Switch 2 and often find yourself deleting some titles to make room for new ones, investing in an SD card can be a smart move.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6411/">Right now, Amazon is offering the 256GB Samsung P9 Express microSD card for just $33, after taking 40% off its usual $55 retail price</a>. Prime members get to enjoy free delivery, so they’re saving a few extra dollars on that front too. This is also the lowest we have seen this memory card drop to since its release, but as you’d expect, the deal is selling out fast. We suggest getting your orders in as soon as you can before the price shoots back up – which could be any moment now.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6411/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Spacious Capacity With Impressive Speeds</h2>
<p>Starting with the storage; you’re getting a nice 256GB of additional storage with this card, which translates into more space for the latest releases, updates, DLC, and even screenshots. You will be able to have all the titles you like installed and ready to go; no need to choose what to delete to make room for something new every few weeks. The capacity this version gets you should be enough for casual gamers who mostly play smaller indie titles. However, if you’re looking to download a bunch of large AAA games, you might want to consider grabbing the 512GB version, which is sitting at $100 at the time of writing. This will help you avoid the same old loop where you find yourself with limited storage every few weeks.</p>
<p>As for the performance, you’re looking at sequential read speeds up to 800 MB/s, which helps load games considerably faster than the brand’s standard microSD cards. That means spending less time on loading or updating, and quicker game launches. Despite the impressive capabilities, the card maintains an ideal temperature as it works, even during intense matches. That’s thanks to its Dynamic Thermal Guards, which work tirelessly to keep the card from overheating while ensuring smooth performance.</p>



<p>Best of all, the card is made to work with Nintendo Switch 2, plus it plays nicely with a range of microSD UHS-I devices, including computers, handheld consoles, tablets, and even cameras. When using it with a camera, you can expect it to capture stunning 4K video and photos like a pro!</p>
<p>You’re also getting a 6-proof protection with a 3-year limited warranty with your purchase. It’s basically temperature, drop, magnet, water, X-ray, and wearout proof, which means you’ll enjoy consistent performance 24/7. Samsung Magician software helps you keep an eye on the health of the card and monitor performance with ease.</p>
<p>All in all, if you’re looking for an easy way of boosting the overall storage of your console while still enjoying good performance, this P9 Express microSD card can be a good addition to your setup.<a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6411/"> It normally goes for $55, which is already quite affordable considering all that you’re getting, but the current 40% discount makes it even more approachable.</a> And since it works with a range of devices, now is a great time to pick a couple of these for your cameras, tablet, or even laptop – without blowing your budget!</p>
