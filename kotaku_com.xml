With danger lurking around every corner and extremely limited resources at your disposal, you’ll want to approach every moment with caution and planning. Before you set off on your journey in <em>Atomfall</em>, here are three tips to keep in mind that can help improve your chances at survival.</p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="197298" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="Live Forever in the Universe of 'New World: Aeternum'" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="108" data-playlist="197298,197284,197260" data-current="197298"><div><p>Live Forever in the Universe of 'New World: Aeternum'</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197298/197298_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197298/197298_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197298/197298_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197298/197298_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"></video></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><h2 id="h5107706"><a id=""></a>Customize your experience as you see fit</h2><p><em>Atomfall</em> was created with exploration and immersion in mind, so it avoids spelling too much out for you on its default settings. If you play without any assists, you won’t get objective markers or clearly defined tasks. Instead, you’ll need to suss out things entirely on your own, figuring out where leads are asking you to go by following written clues and your own intuition.</p><figure id="" data-id="a724042b5754c9144eae1670b2547476" data-recommend-id="image://a724042b5754c9144eae1670b2547476" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A screenshot shows difficulty options for Atomfall." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A screenshot shows difficulty options for Atomfall." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Rebellion / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="a724042b5754c9144eae1670b2547476" data-recommend-id="image://a724042b5754c9144eae1670b2547476" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A screenshot shows difficulty options for Atomfall." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>If this doesn’t sound up your alley, that’s totally okay! <strong>You can make the game feel a bit more forgiving by heading into Options &gt; Game &gt; Playstyle and turning on various assists.</strong> You can even set it up so that there are waypoint markers and hints.  This dramatically reduces how much additional work you’ll need to put into figuring out how to navigate Atomfall’s sprawling world.</p><h2 id="h5107707"><a id=""></a>Thorough exploration is the key to your success</h2><p>Regardless of how you’ve customized your playstyle, exploration remains among the most significant parts of <em>Atomfall</em>. You’ll need to check every nook and cranny of the post-nuclear English countryside for leads that will direct you to side-quests, helpful crafting materials to improve your survivability, and all-important Training Stimulants and skill manuals to bolster your skill tree.</p><figure id="" data-id="b7160c92e8b56b285eab5114fcb05795" data-recommend-id="image://b7160c92e8b56b285eab5114fcb05795" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A player comes across a Training Stimulant in a dark environment." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A player comes across a Training Stimulant in a dark environment." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Rebellion / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="b7160c92e8b56b285eab5114fcb05795" data-recommend-id="image://b7160c92e8b56b285eab5114fcb05795" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A player comes across a Training Stimulant in a dark environment." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>It’s worth noting that a lot of these things are easy to miss, so thorough observation remains key. Check for spots you can climb over or under to reach hidden rooms, and thoroughly examine every desk, shelf, and box in an area so as not to miss anything. Even just finding a few extra bullets or a piece of food can make all the difference in a game where resources are so scarce. </p><h2 id="h5107708"><a id=""></a>Stealth is your friend</h2><p>Ammo is hard to come by in <em>Atomfall</em>, so you’ll spend a lot of time in melee combat. However, this means that facing off against tons of foes at once can be extremely overwhelming. <strong>When you’re trying to conserve ammo (or simply don’t have any), you’ll want to resort to stealth.</strong> Sneaking around an enemy encampment while slowly taking out unsuspecting foes and looting their goodies keeps more ammo in your magazines and more health in your, uh, health bar. </p><figure id="" data-id="6ffc0db114ca364e08998a4abc90f8ed" data-recommend-id="image://6ffc0db114ca364e08998a4abc90f8ed" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The player sneaks up on a robot from a distance." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="The player sneaks up on a robot from a distance." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Rebellion / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="6ffc0db114ca364e08998a4abc90f8ed" data-recommend-id="image://6ffc0db114ca364e08998a4abc90f8ed" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The player sneaks up on a robot from a distance." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>If you’re not prepared with adequate resources when all hell breaks loose, though, just run far away and try again later. There’s no shame in regrouping and taking things slowly in a game designed around tense survival mechanics. Your goal is to live to see another day, after all.</p><hr><p><br><em>Atomfall</em> is available on March 27 for PS5 PS4, Xbox Series X/S, and Windows PCs.   </p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Taking place in an alternate reality following the Windscale nuclear disaster of 1957, this UK-based survival-action experience provides a large open-world experience with plenty to do and see in a radioactive England. Here’s how long it’ll take you to see what <em>Atomfall</em> has to offer.</p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="195891" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="The Week In Games: What’s Coming Out Beyond Alan Wake 2" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="156" data-playlist="195891,195301,194651" data-current="195891"><div><p>The Week In Games: What’s Coming Out Beyond Alan Wake 2</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195891/195891_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195891/195891_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195891/195891_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195891/195891_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/21406.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><h2 id="h4128030"><a id=""></a>How long does it take to finish <em>Atomfall</em>?</h2><p><em>Atomfall</em> is an open-zone game that gives you a lot of freedom in how you approach its narrative. You can follow along with the quests given to you by various NPCs, or you can choose to slaughter everyone in your path and figure things out for yourself. Moreover, the game doesn’t do a lot of hand-holding, so you’ll need to spend a lot of time paying close attention to details,studying your environment to find important items and locations. </p><p>All of this freedom helps make the overall experience of <em>Atomfall</em> fairly unique for each player. As such, each person’s playtime will differ based on how they approach the story and the options available to them. Because choices and ingenuity play such a large part in how long the game can last, it’s somewhat difficult to say exactly how long it will take someone to beat. </p><p>Generally speaking, though, if you’re the kind of person who doesn’t venture too far off the beaten path and plans to just focus on pushing through the narrative beats of the game, <strong>you’re likely to get anywhere from 10-20 hours out of your journey through <em>Atomfall</em></strong>—again, largely depending on which choices you make along the way.</p><figure id="" data-id="b757d9e24cd7a292e322363fae5a1fa3" data-recommend-id="image://b757d9e24cd7a292e322363fae5a1fa3" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The player holds a mine detector while walking through an overgrown wasteland." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="The player holds a mine detector while walking through an overgrown wasteland." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="false" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Rebellion</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="b757d9e24cd7a292e322363fae5a1fa3" data-recommend-id="image://b757d9e24cd7a292e322363fae5a1fa3" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The player holds a mine detector while walking through an overgrown wasteland." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>But, if you’re looking to see and do everything <em>Atomfall</em> has to offer, you’ll be able to squeeze quite a lot more out of this post-apocalyptic outing. Doing as much as possible in a single run can easily score you many, many more hours of gameplay than a strictly narrative-focused outing. And <strong>if you’re looking to grab every trophy/achievement in the game, you’ll need to beat it various times while following different paths</strong>. You’ll even be rewarded for finding a way to complete the game in under five hours!</p><p>There’s a ton of replay value in <em>Atomfall</em>, so you’ll be able to play through it as many times as you’d like while always seeing something new. This choice-driven, post-nuclear survival game is available on March 27 for PS5, PS4, Xbox Series X/S, and Windows PCs. </p><p>.  </p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

While they all had slightly different answers and thoughts, the general consensus was that nobody wanted to directly compete with Rockstar’s juggernaut. </p><p>“We don’t want to be anywhere near [<em>GTA 6</em>]. We are working up multiple different plans for our titles,” said an unnamed boss at a massive publisher.</p><p>Another exec at a big game company told the outlet that it’s “tough out there,” even without<em> GTA 6</em> around. “It’s immensely difficult to find free time for new games to shine,” they said, and added that free time is “the real scarcity for us, not money.”</p><p>A third executive,  in charge of a large European publisher, said “We don’t want to launch just before or just after the game. If it arrives in late October, that means you either have to launch early—which a lot of people seem to be doing with the recent glut of summer release dates.

According to the Dring, publishers he spoke to have multiple plans in place just in case. </p><p>“If we move out of 2025, what if Rockstar do, too?” said one exec. “Will we have time to push our game up? Or will we have to delay further? It’s stressful.”</p><p> .<br></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
