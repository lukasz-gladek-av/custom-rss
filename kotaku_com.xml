              <p>Star Wars remains LEGO’s most coveted license with countless sets from the franchise earning exceptional ratings from builders worldwide. The adorable R2-D2 droid exemplifies this success perfectly and boasts a 4.9 out of 5 stars across thousands of reviews. By fortunate timing, this set has just dropped to an all-time low on Amazon, and it’s flying off the shelves: <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4474/">At $79 down from its usual $99 price, this 1,050-piece building experience delivers both a satisfying construction project and a display piece</a> that captures one of cinema’s most iconic characters in brick form.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4474/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<p>No introduction is needed to any Star Wars aficionado for R2-D2. The clever astromech droid has appeared in every but the most insignificant Star Wars films and TV shows and saves the heroes with technological magic and unflinching perseverance time and again. This LEGO set remains true to R2’s charm with meticulous care for detail and playful interactive features. The completed model stands <strong>over 9 inches high, 6 inches wide, and 4 inches deep</strong>, which makes a grand impression without taking up too much of your shelf real estate.</p>



<h2>Interactive Details That Bring R2-D2 to Life</h2>
<p><strong>R2-D2’s dome head will rotate 360 degrees</strong> so that you can pose him like he’s scanning his surroundings or reacting to droids and minifigures across from him. This rotating system uses LEGO Technic parts hidden in the build to create smooth motion without loosening after extended periods. The <strong>third leg that is removable also flexes and folds</strong>, emulating R2’s movement from the films in which he transitions from his stable three-legged form to his faster two-wheeled wheel mode. An <strong>attachable periscope</strong> replica’s the sensor that sticks out of R2’s dome during recon missions and other attachable tools wink to the many various gadgets he’s dispatched throughout the saga, from arc welders to drink service trays.</p>
<p>The set includes a <strong>bonus 25th Anniversary Darth Malak minifigure</strong> and celebrates LEGO Star Wars’ quarter century milestone. Darth Malak is from the well-loved Knights of the Old Republic video game and belongs to the wider Star Wars universe beyond the films. Including him not only provides collectibility but also provides you with an option for a display other than R2-D2 himself.</p>



<p>The building <strong>experience uses 1,050 pieces</strong> and offers a number of hours of enjoyable constructing that is <strong>appropriate for 10 years and up</strong>. LEGO instruction guides guide you through the construction with numbered bags that organize pieces by build phase, precluding the overwhelming feeling of pouring all pieces into one heap.</p>
<p>For $79, you’re getting excellent value for an officially licensed LEGO set of this size and sophistication. Star Wars fans, here is your opportunity.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/luna-controller-for-pc-and-mac-is-now-2x-cheaper-than-a-sony-controller-amazon-clearing-final-stock-2000631580</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/luna-controller-for-pc-and-mac-is-now-2x-cheaper-than-a-sony-controller-amazon-clearing-final-stock.1316341/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Amazon has taken serious steps towards positioning itself in gaming, from acquiring Twitch to developing Luna, its cloud gaming service. Amazon also recognized that the Xbox and PlayStation controllers both command high prices that do not benefit all, especially if you game primarily on PC or mobile. That’s where Luna controller comes in as the smart choice: It’s designed for cross-platform gaming without the console tax, <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4473/">and right now it’s dropped to a record low of $39 from its usual $69 price for Prime Big Deals Day</a>.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4473/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<p>Luna controller was <strong>specifically built for Amazon’s Luna cloud game system</strong>&nbsp;but to call it a single-use controller would be a fallacy. This controller supports <strong>Windows, Mac, Fire TV, Fire tablet, iPhone, iPad, Chromebook, and Android</strong>, which gives you greater mobility than native controllers can. The real innovation lies in the way it connects: You can use it <strong>via WiFi, Bluetooth, or USB</strong> depending on your needs and device.</p>



<h2>Three Connection Methods for Maximum Flexibility</h2>
<p>The WiFi connection is best when you are gaming with Luna games since it skips your computer or phone completely. Traditional controllers transfer input to your device and your device forwards them to the server. Luna controller talks directly to the server and eliminates precious milliseconds. If you ever felt like your character responds slowly while cloud gaming, this setup fixes that problem.</p>



<p>For non-Luna gaming, Bluetooth mode turns it into a standard wireless controller to play with any Bluetooth-enabled device. That provides mobile gaming, emulators or Steam games on your laptop without needing a separate controller. The USB option provides a wired setup for Windows and Mac, free from any wireless interference and offering zero lag when you need every single frame in competitive gaming.</p>
<p>The <strong>screen-switiching technology provides a fluid gaming experience</strong>: You can start playing a Luna game on your Fire TV in the living room, pause while dinner is ready, then pick up where you left off on your iPad in bed that night. Progress is synced up across devices instantly and the controller just reconnects without requiring setup process.</p>



<p><strong>Tilted thumbsticks make hand position easy</strong> during extended sessions, positioned asymmetrically such as Xbox controllers (not symmetrical like PlayStation). The thumbsticks have potentiometers that track subtle motion, important when aiming in shooters or executing fine maneuvers in racing games. Easy-access bumpers are placed on the controller where your index fingers prefer to rest and the triggers at the bottom offer incremental resistance. The analog triggers read how far you’re pressing them which is useful in racing games where you don’t want to rush your throttle or in shooters where you’re attempting to sneak up on a shot.</p>
<p>For $39, you’re paying a controller that’s roughly half as much as an Xbox or PlayStation official controller but comes with some connectivity options they lack.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/this-65w-wall-charger-is-44-off-on-amazon-and-it-juices-up-your-mac-and-iphone-at-once-2000631566</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/this-65w-wall-charger-is-44-off-on-amazon-and-it-juices-up-your-mac-and-iphone-at-once.1316311/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Apple’s official 20W charger costs $20 on their website, and you get exactly one USB-C port for that price. Meanwhile, <em>Ugreen</em> is offering a deal through Amazon that’s frankly absurd: <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4472/">their 65W charger with four ports (including three USB-C) is currently 44 percent off, dropping from $42 to just $23</a>. From a value perspective, this is wild.</p>
<p>Ugreen has built its entire reputation around safety and reliability which makes this price point even more remarkable. You’re getting more than three times the power output, four times the ports, and GaN technology that makes everything safer and more efficient, all for three dollars more than Apple’s most basic single-port option.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4472/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<p>The <strong>Ugreen Nexode 65W has enough juice to charge a MacBook Air to a 51 percent level in 30 minutes</strong>, which is critical when you’re rushing out the door and notice your laptop is running on fumes. That <strong>65W rating can handle power-sucking devices like the MacBook Pro</strong>, iPad Pro or even a Steam Deck at full throttle. The <strong>charger intelligently distributes power</strong> across its four ports based on what’s connected, so you can simultaneously charge your laptop, phone, tablet, and wireless earbuds without needing multiple wall outlets or a power strip cluttering your desk.</p>
<h2>GaN Technology Makes All the Difference</h2>
<p>GaN stands for gallium nitride and it is a semiconductor material that’s replaced traditional silicon in modern chargers. GaN devices switch at much higher voltages and are quicker than silicon and generate less heat and providing more efficient electrical conversion. The payoff in real life is a charger that’s significantly smaller than earlier 65W versions and that operates cooler and safer as well. The foldable plug design means you can simply toss it into your bag without the prongs scratching your laptop or sticking anything.</p>
<p>The built-in safety features are <strong>overheating prevention and overcurrent protection</strong> which proactively monitor power flow and heat. When the charger detects something irregular, it automatically corrects or shuts off to protect your devices. This is crucial since cheap chargers can kill battery health in the long term or, worse still, cause electrical fires.</p>



<p>The four-port design changes the way you charge: <strong>Three USB-C ports and one USB-A port</strong> will accommodate pretty much every device in your life. The USB-A port is great for older accessories like Bluetooth speakers, Kindle e-readers or wireless mouse dongles that still have not upgraded to USB-C. All three of the USB-C ports have Power Delivery support, the fast-charging protocol used by iPhones since iPhone 8, Galaxy and Pixel phones, and all new laptops.</p>
<p>For $23, you’re acquiring a charging solution which can replace multiple single-port chargers yet take up less space and deliver higher performance.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/mac-mini-m4-is-going-for-pennies-apple-is-quietly-offloading-stock-on-amazon-2000631565</link>

              <p>Apple is probably the most discount-averse brand in tech. The company protects its premium image and does everything possible to avoid price cuts, at least on its official website where full retail pricing remains sacred. But something interesting is happening behind the scenes: Apple seems eager to move inventory of its excellent Mac Mini M4, which launched just a year ago and remains their latest desktop offering.</p>
<p>The performance is absolutely wild, and right now the price is exceptionally sweet. This <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4124/">Amazon-exclusive deal drops the M4 Mac Mini 256GB to $499 from its usual $599 price, and you don’t need a Prime membership to grab it</a>.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4124/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>The M4 Chip Redefines Desktop Computing</h2>
<p>The Mac Mini has always been Apple’s <strong>answer to people who want macOS power without paying for a display, keyboard, or mouse</strong> they already own. This 2024 version takes that concept and shrinks it even further while dramatically increasing performance. The computer measures just five inches by five inches, a footprint so compact it fits perfectly next to any monitor without dominating your desk space. You can store it behind a display, stash it in a cabinet, or place it wherever you’d like to have an entire desktop computer minus the bulk.</p>



<p>The <strong>M4 chip in this Mac Mini features a 10-core CPU and a 10-core GPU</strong> and with performance that makes every experience lightning-fast and fluid. The chip has <strong>16GB unified memory</strong> that operates differently than traditional RAM. Unified memory architecture has the GPU and CPU access the same pool of memory, meaning there is no data bottleneck of transferring data between various memory systems.</p>
<p>The 256GB SSD storage delivers rapid boot times and speedy application loading, but do be mindful of your own storage requirements as Mac Mini storage isn’t user-upgradeable once you’ve bought it. The SSD read and write data at speeds that’ll leave conventional hard drives looking positively ancient and that’s important when you’re dealing with large files or virtual machines.</p>
<p>Connectivity has also gotten much better in this generation: The <strong>back panel houses Thunderbolt ports, HDMI output, and Gigabit Ethernet</strong> for high-speed wired internet access. <strong>Front-facing USB-C ports and a headphone jack</strong> debuted for the first time on Mac Mini to eliminate the goofy reach-around to plug in a flash drive or place headphones. Thunderbolt capability enables daisy-chaining multiple 4K displays or connecting high-speed external storage at the same speed as the internal SSD.</p>
<p>The Mac Mini runs all your important software at lightning speed. <a href="https://gizmodo.com/download/microsoft-365">Microsoft 365</a>, Adobe Creative Cloud and thousands of other apps are optimized for Apple silicon, delivering performance way beyond many pricier Windows desktops. If you’re already working with an iPhone or iPad within the Apple ecosystem, the integration is seamless.</p>
<p>Right now, Apple’s refusal to provide discounts makes this price truly stand out in particular.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[If Gaming Is in Your DNA, This Samsung G9 49″ OLED Curved Monitor Is $700+ Off on Amazon]]></title>
            <link>https://kotaku.com/if-gaming-is-in-your-dna-this-samsung-g9-49-oled-curved-monitor-is-700-off-on-amazon-2000631621</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/if-gaming-is-in-your-dna-this-samsung-g9-49%E2%80%B3-oled-curved-monitor-is-700-off-on-amazon.1316281/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Dual monitors are yesterday’s setup. Triple monitor arrays look impressive but waste desk space and demand GPU resources just to manage bezels. The real power move is one massive ultrawide that replaces everything while delivering an experience no multi-monitor rig can match. <strong>Samsung’s 49-inch Odyssey OLED G93SC</strong> solves the fundamental problem gamers face: you need maximum screen real estate, perfect image quality, and response times fast enough to matter in competitive play. This isn’t a compromise solution: It’s the endgame display that removes every excuse between you and peak performance. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3899/">Right now it’s dropped to $879 from its typical $1,599 price on Amazon, a 45 percent discount that brings premium QD-OLED technology within reach of gamers</a>.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3899/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<p>The 49-inch curved display has 5120×1440 resolution which <strong>provides the equivalent of two 27-inch QHD monitors side-by-side</strong> without bezel interruption. That 32:9 aspect ratio dramatically reimagines the experience of games. Racing simulations wrap around your peripheral vision with opponents on each side of you simultaneously. First-person shooters give you situational awareness that is cheating-like, with flanking enemies in sight earlier than players in ordinary displays.</p>



<h2>Gamers Will Love It</h2>
<p><strong>Quantum Dot OLED is the current leader in display technology</strong>, combining OLED’s perfect blacks and infinite contrast with quantum dot color and brightness. Elder LCD screens have bleeder backlights that bleed through black areas, warping shadows and hiding enemies in the shadows. QD-OLED pixels are emitting and can be completely turned off and produce actual blacks with no light bleed. <strong>DisplayHDR True Black 400 certification</strong> means you can see into deep, rich darks but still have great highlights, so you’ll notice movement in dark corridors that other players just can’t spot on their lower-end panels.</p>
<p>The 0.03ms gray-to-gray response time is essentially click-by-click. For context, the majority of gaming monitors market 1ms response time, and a lot of LCD panels fail to even get close to actually providing that figure. This <strong>OLED screen responds 33 times faster</strong> and removes motion blur and ghosting even during high-speed camera pans or acrobatic action scenes. Combined <strong>with the 240Hz refresh rate</strong>, you get 240 separate frames per second with each frame gliding into the next. <strong>HDMI 2.1 and DisplayPort inputs</strong> provide this bandwidth in full so your GPU can send frames at full speed without disruption.</p>



<p>G-Sync and AMD FreeSync Premium Pro support guarantee the <strong>monitor works with both Nvidia and AMD graphics cards</strong>, synchronizing the refresh rate of the panel with the output from your GPU in frames. This eliminates screen tearing, stutter and input lag and produces smooth motion even when frame rates are changing during fast motion scenes.</p>
<p>The slim build is just 4.5mm thick at its thinnest, with a premium metal finish that feels expensive sitting on your desk. The height-adjustable stand means you can position the gigantic screen at perfect eye level, and the USB hub makes it simple to plug in peripherals without reaching behind to your PC.</p>
<p>At $879, this is the cheapest way to get into premium ultrawide QD-OLED gaming. This monitor normally retails for $1,599, and other ultrawides with such specs cost even more.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Many people don’t need the latest MacBook Pro with its $4,000 sticker shock but they also can’t do real work on a $300 Chromebook that chokes on anything beyond web browsing. The middle ground does exist, and HP has hit it out of the park with<strong> this 17-inch laptop that offers real productivity features without the premium price</strong>.</p>
<p>The brand appears to be clearing inventory and rather than advertising these savings on their own site, they’re unloading units under the radar on Amazon at historically low prices. This <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4476/">HP 17″ laptop (Intel Core i3, 32GB RAM, 1TB SSD, Windows 11 Pro) has been chopped from $2,399 down to $699, a 71 percent discount</a> that puts professional-grade computing in the budget of students and remote workers.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4476/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>The 17.3-Inch Display Changes Your Workflow</h2>
<p>This is driven by the <strong>Intel Core i3-N305 8-core processor up to 3.2GHz</strong> and Intel UHD Graphics. This configuration handles everyday multitasking, web surfing, document editing and media playback without frustration or lag. The i3-N305 is Intel’s energy-efficient hybrid architecture designed for laptops that balances performance and battery life by dynamically shifting workloads between the performance and efficiency cores based on what you’re doing. You won’t be rendering 4K video or playing AAA games on max settings, but for office work and streaming entertainment, this processor delivers smooth performance.</p>



<p>Screen size matters more than many people realize until they’ve actually worked on a larger display: The <strong>17.3-inch HD+ screen gives you much more workspace than standard 15.6-inch laptops</strong>, reducing the constant window juggling and tab switching that breaks your concentration. The 1600×900 resolution packs approximately 1.4 million pixels and delivers crisp text rendering and sharp graphics for documents and videos. The anti-glare coating reduces reflections from overhead lighting and windows.</p>
<p>The 32GB of RAM changes how you work by eliminating the performance limitations of heavy multitasking. You can have dozens of browser tabs open, several <a href="https://gizmodo.com/download/microsoft-365">Microsoft 365 applications</a> open simultaneously, be in video calls as you work on presentations and still have apps running in the background without noticing the slowdowns.</p>
<p>The <strong>1TB PCIe NVMe SSD provides fast and spacious storage</strong> with Windows boot times in seconds and instant app opening. PCIe NVMe technology provides read and write speeds up to 15 times faster than traditional mechanical hard drives, which transfer files quickly and make opening large documents instant.</p>
<p>At $699, you’re getting a genuinely capable laptop that performs real work without compromise.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Microsoft’s <a href="https://kotaku.com/xbox-game-pass-cancel-controversy-console-pc-2000631061">unpopular Game Pass price hikes</a> have caught the attention of Lina Khan. The former head of the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) took to social media on Friday to once again criticize the company’s acquisition of <em>Call of Duty</em> maker Activision Blizzard. “As dominant firms become too-big-to-care, they can make things worse for their customers without having to worry about the consequences,” she wrote just a day after the price of Game Pass Ultimate rose to $30 a month.</p> <p>It was Khan’s FTC during the Biden Administration <a href="https://kotaku.com/microsoft-activision-ftc-deal-court-call-duty-xbox-ps5-1850623628">that sued Microsoft to prevent the $70 billion Activision Blizzard deal</a> from going through. The regulator argued that further market consolidation in gaming would harm consumers, and ended up taking the matter to court. A judge ultimately ruled in favor of Microsoft, but that hasn’t stopped Khan and others from criticizing the outcome in the years since.</p>

 <p>“Microsoft’s acquisition of Activision has been followed by significant price hikes and layoffs, harming both gamers and developers,” she posted on X today alongside a chart showing Game Pass prices doubling since the trial concluded. “As we’ve seen across sectors, increasing market consolidation and increasing prices often go hand-in-hand.”</p>

 <h2>Microsoft promised regulators Game Pass prices wouldn’t go up</h2> <p>Khan isn’t the only one going “I told you so” this week. Shortly after the latest Game Pass price hikes were announced, players started circulating the company’s old quotes back during the Activision merger fight. The UK’s Competition and Markets Authority also tried to block the deal over pricing concerns.</p>

 <p>“Game Pass prices will not increase as a result of the Merger, and certainly will not increase to a point that offsets the substantial benefits of Activision titles coming to Game Pass on a day and date basis,” the company <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/microsoft-insists-game-pass-prices-will-not-increase-as-a-result-of-activision-merger/">claimed back in 2023</a>. “This is especially so given Game Pass will continue to be constrained by B2P [buy to play].”</p>

 <p>In the years since, Microsoft appears to have done exactly that, <a href="https://kotaku.com/black-ops-7-game-pass-call-duty-points-discount-changes-2000631483">adding <em>Call of Duty</em> to Game Pass</a> but jacking up the price as well, even though players can still choose to buy the game à la carte for $70 on console and PC.</p> <p>Microsoft might argue that $30 a month is a fair price to pay for subscription-based access to <em>Black Ops 7</em> and hundreds of other games. It’s impossible to know without access to rest of the Xbox math, most of which Microsoft stopped reporting to the public years ago. All we know is that according to Microsoft, Game Pass was profitable and generating $5 billion in revenue a year, even before the latest price hikes.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><span>In most ways, </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/digimon-story-time-stranger-the-kotaku-review-2000630341"><i><span>Digimon Story: Time Stranger</span></i></a> <span>isn’t a complicated RPG. The turn-based monster tamer’s battles are mostly straightforward, and it’s got waypoints telling you where to go for most missions. However, after spending 40 hours in the game, I do have a few quick tips for those of you heading to the Digital World now that the game is out. Grab your Digivice and let’s go.</span></p> <h2><b>You will lose access to side quests for dozens of hours</b></h2> <p><span>Easily the most frustrating thing I encountered in my first playthrough of </span><i><span>Time Stranger </span></i><span>was the way it gates side quests. Without getting into spoilers, there’s a point when the game will warn you that some of the side quests you’ve been doing will be inaccessible for an undetermined amount of time. Years of playing video games had me expecting this meant I wouldn’t be able to complete those quests until I finished the story mission I was about to embark on. As it turns out, it would be dozens of hours before I could go back to those quests. This would normally have been fine, but side quests have a lot more to offer in </span><i><span>Time Stranger </span></i><span>than just a side story and some loot. Throughout the game, you’ll get Anomaly Points that raise your Agent rank. Digivolution levels are gated behind leveling up this rank, and if you can’t complete more quests, you might be stuck at a lower rank and unable to level up your party until much, </span><i><span>much </span></i><span>later in the game. So heed this warning when you hit it, because it really fails to adequately warn you just how long it will be before you can go back to those missions.</span></p>

 <h2><b>Using items doesn’t cost you a turn</b></h2> <p><span>One of the merciful things </span><i><span>Time Stranger </span></i><span>does is that it allows you to use an item </span><i><span>and </span></i><span>attack each turn, rather than choosing between them. This means you’ll be able to heal up your team, raise stats, or remove a status effect without having to give up doing some damage as well. A lot of other turn-based RPGs tend to make you choose between these options as a strategic challenge, but you’ll be glad </span><i><span>Time Stranger</span></i><span> doesn’t when you endure one of its long, drawn-out boss fights.</span></p>

 <h2><b>Upgrading your Agent rank helps circumvent grind</b></h2> <p><span>Those Anomaly points you get for completing quests are used to upgrade your Agent rank, which enables you to unlock Agent skills on a skill tree. Some of these perks are universal, such as giving you access to new high-impact Cross Arts abilities that can benefit your whole team. However, some of them are applied only to certain Digimon with different personality types. If you go down one skill tree, you’ll be able to raise stats and experience for the friendly Digimon in your team, while another path will grant you those perks for brave Digimon. So don’t just go down these skill trees without some plan in place, as they can help you reach powerful new heights if you target specific traits and personality types. It’s much simpler than grinding random battles.</span></p>

 <h2><b>Don’t get precious about saving your Cross Art</b></h2> <p><span>Cross Arts abilities can have a wide variety of uses in battles. They can heal your team, raise their stats, or they can take a chunk of your enemy’s health bar down and leave them with debuffs for a few turns. Since they can be so impactful, you might feel like you need to hold your Cross Art for a big boss fight, but this ability charges up fast when you do pretty much anything in battle. Attacking an enemy or using an item can give you points toward your Cross Arts gauge, so it’s pretty easy to fire off multiple uses of this in a longer fight. Feel free to use it often, and keep in mind that the more actions you can do in a turn, the more charge you’ll get toward using it again.&nbsp;</span></p> <h2><b>Try to have a rideable Digimon on your team at all times</b></h2> <p><span>Some Digimon can double as both a party member and a rideable mount. I rode my Growlmon for much of the game, but when he digivolved to WarGrowlmon, he couldn’t carry me on his shoulders anymore. Thankfully, WereGarurumon stepped up and put me on his shoulder, and later, when he became MetalGarurumon, I was able to ride on his back. Riding your Digimon gets you places faster than walking on foot, but as they transform into new, stronger versions of themselves, they might lose the ability to carry you around. Just be mindful of this as you move throughout the evolution tree.</span></p>
