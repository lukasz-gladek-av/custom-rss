The rest of the studio was then mostly populated with fresh graduates. “I didn’t even have a budget when I started, because it was an internal production,” Yoshida said. The <em>Legend of Dragoon</em> team would eventually be 100 strong and  end up costing Sony $16 million. </p><p>A lot of the effort by that large team went toward the game’s infamous 30 minutes of, at the time, gorgeous CGI cutscenes. While the prerendered backgrounds and polygonal character models were looking roughly on par with what Square was doing at the end of the PS1's life, the cinematics helped elevate into a much more epic and lavish-feeling game overall. The other highlight was the timed battle mechanic that turned combat into a mini-rhythm game, an evolution of what Hasebe had created for <em>Super Mario RPG</em> (and which continues in the modern <em>Paper Mario</em> games). <br></p><p>“Eventually, we recouped that (cost), thanks to sales outside Japan,” Yoshida <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/how-sonys-most-creative-studio-rose-from-the-ashes-1458030068?_gl=1*1cb2wzs*_ga*MTc0MjY2NTg1OS4xNzQwMzc1OTc4*_ga_V4QNJTT5L0*MTc0MjgzNzczOS4yOC4xLjE3NDI4NDEwNDAuNTguMC4w&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/how-sonys-most-creative-studio-rose-from-the-ashes-1458030068?_gl=1*1cb2wzs*_ga*MTc0MjY2NTg1OS4xNzQwMzc1OTc4*_ga_V4QNJTT5L0*MTc0MjgzNzczOS4yOC4xLjE3NDI4NDEwNDAuNTguMC4w">previously told <em>Kotaku</em></a></span>. “The sales in the U.S. were very strong.” Unfortunately not strong enough to manifest a sequel or spiritual successor. Fortunately, <em>The Legend of Dragoon</em> is playable today after coming to PS5 a couple of years ago, though deep down in my heart of hearts I’m still hopeful we’ll eventually get <em>The Legend of Dragoon 2</em>. </p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Rumors have been swirling of <em>Halo:The Master Chief Collection</em> and a<em> Gears of War</em> remaster anthology coming to PS5 this year as well, leaving many fans to suspect that 2023's sprawling sci-fi RPG <em>Starfield </em>can’t be that far behind. </p><p>Microsoft hasn’t completely dispensed with exclusivity yet, however, with action adventure<em>&nbsp;</em>game <em>South of Midnight </em>arriving on Xbox next month from Compulsion Games. The Southern gothic fantasy features platforming, puzzle solving, and magical abilities inspired by Southern folklore, and while we’ll probably see it on PS5 as well at some point, as of yet no date has been confirmed. </p><p>.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

The series turns survivor’s guilt into a blood-soaked curse, punishing those who narrowly avoid tragedy with even more elaborate and grotesque ends. And what makes these deaths so chilling isn’t just the gore; it’s how often they begin with something stupidly mundane. A dropped ring. A spilled drink. A loose screw. These micro-moments cascade into horrifying Rube Goldberg machines of death, reminding us that fate doesn’t need a big reason, just a small opening. You survive the plane crash? Congratulations. Now your bathroom rug might kill you.</p><p>With the new film <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/final-destination-bloodlines-movie-trailer-1851754613?_gl=1*12jz979*_ga*MTc0MjY2NTg1OS4xNzQwMzc1OTc4*_ga_V4QNJTT5L0*MTc0MjYwNTMyMi4yMy4wLjE3NDI2MDUzMjQuNTguMC4w&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/final-destination-bloodlines-movie-trailer-1851754613?_gl=1*12jz979*_ga*MTc0MjY2NTg1OS4xNzQwMzc1OTc4*_ga_V4QNJTT5L0*MTc0MjYwNTMyMi4yMy4wLjE3NDI2MDUzMjQuNTguMC4w"><em>Final Destination: Bloodlines</em></a></span> on the way, it’s time to revisit the franchise’s most gruesome deaths, not just to relive the carnage, but to rank them by how likely they are to actually happen. A good portion of the most memorable <em>Final Destination </em>deaths are outrageous and defy any semblance of logic, while the most unforgettable ones are indelibly etched in our nightmares because of how they mirror freak accidents we’ve all read about in the news a little too closely. So say your prayers and maybe have a throw-up bucket next to you as we count down the 14 most gruesome <em>Final Destination</em> deaths, from the impossible to the frighteningly probable. </p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="d17188136f8d163b2356f8cd87fd60f9" data-recommend-id="image://d17188136f8d163b2356f8cd87fd60f9" data-format="jpg" data-width="600" data-height="338" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="A man being strangled" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A man being strangled" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->New Line Cinema</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="d17188136f8d163b2356f8cd87fd60f9" data-recommend-id="image://d17188136f8d163b2356f8cd87fd60f9" data-format="jpg" data-width="600" data-height="338" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="A man being strangled" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>The bathtub strangulation in the original <em>Final Destination</em> is the franchise at its most implausibly clumsy. After slipping in the tub, Tod Waggner (Chad Donella) becomes entangled in a clothesline that coils around his neck with the perfect amount of force and positioning to strangle him—without snapping, slipping, or triggering any kind of instinctive reaction to save himself. The setup is slow and the death is awkward, relying on a wildly improbable Rube Goldberg sequence that stretches the rules of physics and common sense. Instead of dread, it plays like a parody of what the series does best: grounding the supernatural in the everyday.</p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="be6889e4118cb9df1eb761a3579499ef" data-recommend-id="image://be6889e4118cb9df1eb761a3579499ef" data-format="jpg" data-width="600" data-height="255" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="A man crawling for his life" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A man crawling for his life" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->New Line Cinema</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="be6889e4118cb9df1eb761a3579499ef" data-recommend-id="image://be6889e4118cb9df1eb761a3579499ef" data-format="jpg" data-width="600" data-height="255" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="A man crawling for his life" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>The hospital bathtub death in <em>The Final Destination</em> is easily one of the most ridiculous scenes in the entire franchise—an unintentional comedy of errors disguised as horror. Cowboy (Jackson Walker), recovering in a hospital bed, is suddenly crushed by a full-sized bathtub that crashes through the  ceiling after an upstairs unit floods. The idea that a hospital would have an upstairs bathtub, left overflowing long enough to rot the floor and drop it like an anvil, defies every rule of logic, architecture, and basic plumbing. It’s not tension—it’s pure cartoon. The scene sacrifices realism for spectacle so hard, it’s hard not to laugh even as blood sprays across the room.</p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="462c748d3ba6d3bb5121d990e832c04d" data-recommend-id="image://462c748d3ba6d3bb5121d990e832c04d" data-format="jpg" data-width="600" data-height="400" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="A man looking to avoid danger" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A man looking to avoid danger" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->New Line Cinema</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="462c748d3ba6d3bb5121d990e832c04d" data-recommend-id="image://462c748d3ba6d3bb5121d990e832c04d" data-format="jpg" data-width="600" data-height="400" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="A man looking to avoid danger" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>The chain link fence death in <em>The Final Destination</em> is peak cartoon violence masquerading as horror. After a tire launch catapults a man into a fence, he’s instantly diced into neat chunks like CGI meat through a wire slicer. It’s flashy, sure—but so absurd it kills any sense of tension, trading plausibility for spectacle and leaving behind the eerie realism that usually makes the franchise hit harder.</p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="467da5bb45fe4c3b939bce5920af541a" data-recommend-id="image://467da5bb45fe4c3b939bce5920af541a" data-format="webp" data-width="740" data-height="494" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Man gets head cut by engine" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Man gets head cut by engine" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->New Line Cinema</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="467da5bb45fe4c3b939bce5920af541a" data-recommend-id="image://467da5bb45fe4c3b939bce5920af541a" data-format="webp" data-width="740" data-height="494" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Man gets head cut by engine" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>There aren’t many deaths in the <em>Final Destination</em> franchise that are as hilariously over-the-top as the engine fan kill in <em>Final Destination 3</em>. It plays out like a fever dream of mechanical chaos—an improbable chain reaction involving a falling wrench and an absurdly unstable shelf somehow launches an engine fan across the room with the precision and force of a cannonball. A full-speed headshot that turns a mechanic’s skull into splatter art is how the scene flatly ends. It’s ridiculous not just in execution but in concept, abandoning any pretense of realism in favor of pure shock value. The scene is memorable, sure—but only because it feels like a scene that escaped from a spoof.</p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="ecd0519d6d8f9012d32ca35cdf2b2176" data-recommend-id="image://ecd0519d6d8f9012d32ca35cdf2b2176" data-format="jpg" data-width="1200" data-height="801" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Eye surgery gone wrong" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Eye surgery gone wrong" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->New Line Cinema</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="ecd0519d6d8f9012d32ca35cdf2b2176" data-recommend-id="image://ecd0519d6d8f9012d32ca35cdf2b2176" data-format="jpg" data-width="1200" data-height="801" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Eye surgery gone wrong" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>In a film franchise built on domino-effect demises, the laser eye surgery death in <em>Final Destination 5</em> begins with an unnerving sense of believability. A routine LASIK procedure is already loaded with vulnerability—strapped to a table, unable to blink, a literal laser inches from the cornea. It’s the kind of scenario that taps into real-world anxiety, and for a few moments, the film plays it straight: a malfunctioning machine, a distracted technician, a minor tremor of instability. But just as the audience settles into the discomfort of what could be a grounded medical mishap, the sequence careens into pure ridiculousness. A flailing escape attempt leads to a misstep, sending the victim crashing through a skyscraper window to a glass-shattering death on the pavement below. It’s a tonal nosedive—from claustrophobic tension to Looney Tunes physics. While the laser to the eye flirts with genuine dread, the swan dive into a plate-glass finale reminds us this isn’t a cautionary tale—it’s cinematic chaos wrapped in a thin sheet of plausibility.</p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="e4956bb1bd28c74537372df11a591054" data-recommend-id="image://e4956bb1bd28c74537372df11a591054" data-format="jpg" data-width="740" data-height="494" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="A Man Stranding With A Decapitated Head" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A Man Stranding With A Decapitated Head" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->New Line Cinema</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="e4956bb1bd28c74537372df11a591054" data-recommend-id="image://e4956bb1bd28c74537372df11a591054" data-format="jpg" data-width="740" data-height="494" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="A Man Stranding With A Decapitated Head" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>The shrapnel decapitation in <em>Final Destination 5</em> is completely ridiculous—an industrial-strength physics-defying moment where a bolt somehow triggers a pressure blast strong enough to launch a metal shard with sniper-like precision through someone’s neck. It’s over-the-top even by the franchise’s standards, but oddly, it flirts with realism just enough to not feel entirely out of place. In the world of <em>Final Destination</em>, where death has a flair for the theatrical, this one feels like it <em>could</em> almost happen…if every safety protocol failed and the laws of physics decided to no longer matter.</p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="87331c285ceae8cde840dd6eec0da942" data-recommend-id="image://87331c285ceae8cde840dd6eec0da942" data-format="jpg" data-width="600" data-height="338" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Woman impaled by a flagpole" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Woman impaled by a flagpole" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->New Line Cinema</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="87331c285ceae8cde840dd6eec0da942" data-recommend-id="image://87331c285ceae8cde840dd6eec0da942" data-format="jpg" data-width="600" data-height="338" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Woman impaled by a flagpole" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>In the chaos-courting universe of <em>Final Destination 3</em>, the flagpole impalement stands out as a moment in which coincidence wears a clown mask and performs a high-wire act. After a runaway roller coaster premonition sets fate on a kill streak, one unlucky teen finds herself at the mercy of a derailed parade float, slippery asphalt, and gravity’s cruel sense of humor. The scene hinges on a series of increasingly far-fetched missteps: a rogue truck causes a flag to snap loose, the pole arcs through the air like a javelin of doom, and—against all odds—finds its mark mid-tumble. It’s less “freak accident” and more “physics-defying murder ballet,” the kind of kill that asks you to suspend not just disbelief, but every principle of probability. Still, buried beneath the theatrical absurdity is a kernel of nightmare fuel: the idea that a simple misstep in a seemingly harmless environment—a community celebration, no less—could end in such grotesque finality. Realistic? Only if you assume Murphy’s Law had a vendetta that day. But in the world of <em>Final Destination</em>, that’s just another Tuesday.</p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="14d34b8eac34440b539cfea6832a62cb" data-recommend-id="image://14d34b8eac34440b539cfea6832a62cb" data-format="webp" data-width="680" data-height="382" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Woman dying from tanning bed" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Woman dying from tanning bed" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->New Line Cinema</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="14d34b8eac34440b539cfea6832a62cb" data-recommend-id="image://14d34b8eac34440b539cfea6832a62cb" data-format="webp" data-width="680" data-height="382" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Woman dying from tanning bed" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>The tanning bed death in <em>Final Destination 3</em> is a perfect storm of teenage vanity, dumb luck, and over-the-top horror theatrics. Two high school girls, looking for a golden glow, end up slow-roasting inside malfunctioning tanning booths after a series of mundane mishaps—spilled drinks, a fallen coat, and a jammed door—combine into a lethal trap. The scene is pure sensory overload: crackling heat, blaring pop music, and the eerie glow of UV lights bathing their panic in an almost surreal glow. On the surface, it’s outrageous—like a twisted parody of the dangers of self-care. But beneath the chaos is a sliver of real-world dread. Tanning beds have sparked fires before, electrical systems <em>can</em> fail, and the claustrophobic idea of being trapped with no way out is a universal fear. It’s absurd, yes, but with just enough plausibility to make you think twice the next time you step into a machine that locks from the outside.</p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="b37268527207f7c2bf08d0405002fd2e" data-recommend-id="image://b37268527207f7c2bf08d0405002fd2e" data-format="webp" data-width="640" data-height="272" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="A man's head being crushed" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A man's head being crushed" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->New Line Cinema</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="b37268527207f7c2bf08d0405002fd2e" data-recommend-id="image://b37268527207f7c2bf08d0405002fd2e" data-format="webp" data-width="640" data-height="272" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="A man's head being crushed" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Amid the Rube Goldberg-level madness that defines <em>Final Destination 5</em>, the acupuncture fire death manages to be both absurdly over-the-top and uncomfortably grounded. A man, fresh from a tension-relieving acupuncture session, becomes the victim of a freak chain reaction involving spilled alcohol, a knocked-over candle, and a faulty massage table. It’s ludicrous in design—watching a human pincushion flail around a burning room before being impaled by a collapsing shelf almost plays like dark comedy. And yet, there’s a sliver of plausibility buried under the spectacle: open flames, flammable liquids, and precariously stacked furniture are real hazards. Strip away the theatrics, and you’re left with a scenario that could feasibly make its way into a fire department safety PSA. It’s death by coincidence dialed up to eleven, but it still taps into that primal fear of small mistakes snowballing into catastrophe, and a cautionary tale on why you should never stack heavy objects too high up on a shelf.</p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="eeff67a6752002edd62e8dc9503c4c6e" data-recommend-id="image://eeff67a6752002edd62e8dc9503c4c6e" data-format="jpg" data-width="974" data-height="408" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Woman with a rock in his eye" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Woman with a rock in his eye" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->New Line Cinema</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="eeff67a6752002edd62e8dc9503c4c6e" data-recommend-id="image://eeff67a6752002edd62e8dc9503c4c6e" data-format="jpg" data-width="974" data-height="408" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Woman with a rock in his eye" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Among the franchise’s catalog of elaborate fatalities, the rock-through-the-eye death in <em>The Final Destination</em> stands out for how terrifyingly ordinary it is. A woman, seated casually at a racetrack, becomes an instant casualty when a rogue tire launches a rock that punctures her skull with surgical precision. There’s no suspenseful orchestration or theatrical flair—just a flash of chaos that turns into silence. It’s the kind of moment that feels ripped from a real news headline, a split-second tragedy born of nothing more than unlucky timing and brutal physics. The realism is what makes it linger, reminding viewers that not every horror needs build-up—sometimes, it just happens.</p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="7a5b9ec7aa28860789f2f7616210531f" data-recommend-id="image://7a5b9ec7aa28860789f2f7616210531f" data-format="webp" data-width="720" data-height="480" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Young boy looking through glass" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Young boy looking through glass" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->New Line Cinema</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="7a5b9ec7aa28860789f2f7616210531f" data-recommend-id="image://7a5b9ec7aa28860789f2f7616210531f" data-format="webp" data-width="720" data-height="480" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Young boy looking through glass" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Few deaths in the <em>Final Destination</em> series feel as shockingly mundane—and thus unforgettable—as the glass pane kill in <em>Final Destination 2</em>. Tim Carpenter (James Kirk) doesn’t die in some elaborate deathtrap or fiery explosion; he’s crushed in broad daylight by a falling sheet of glass that appears almost out of nowhere. There’s no time to process, no final words—just the deafening crash and the horrifying silence that follows. What makes it so haunting is how easy it is to imagine in real life. Construction mishaps happen. People walk under scaffolding every day. It’s quick, brutal, and indifferent, and that’s exactly why it sticks with you long after the credits roll.</p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="cc9197e5765f6ed368f23eaefe3a6dc3" data-recommend-id="image://cc9197e5765f6ed368f23eaefe3a6dc3" data-format="webp" data-width="1200" data-height="675" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Woman walking backwards into the street" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Woman walking backwards into the street" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->New Line Cinema</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="cc9197e5765f6ed368f23eaefe3a6dc3" data-recommend-id="image://cc9197e5765f6ed368f23eaefe3a6dc3" data-format="webp" data-width="1200" data-height="675" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Woman walking backwards into the street" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>The death of Terry Chaney (Amanda Detmer) in the original <em>Final Destination</em> is burned into pop culture not because of gore or buildup, but because it feels like something that could happen tomorrow—and probably will. There’s no dramatic score, no final scream, just a bitter argument cut short by a city bus that turns her into a smear on the pavement. The suddenness is the point. Unlike the franchise’s usual mousetrap mechanics, this death doesn’t warn you, it reminds you. It’s fast, brutal, and so grounded in reality that for years, people flinch when standing too close to the curb.</p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="4abb88b735e0030244266ae6d57d7384" data-recommend-id="image://4abb88b735e0030244266ae6d57d7384" data-format="jpg" data-width="1400" data-height="700" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Gymnast preparing for practice" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Gymnast preparing for practice" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->New Line Cinema</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="4abb88b735e0030244266ae6d57d7384" data-recommend-id="image://4abb88b735e0030244266ae6d57d7384" data-format="jpg" data-width="1400" data-height="700" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Gymnast preparing for practice" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>If you ever wanted to know why Simone Biles is often considered the greatest Olympian of all time, you can just watch the grim reality of gymnastics displayed in <em>Final Destination 5</em>. Typically, the <em>Final Destination </em>trope of a loose screw or tipped-over cup of water starting a lethal domino effect reduces the deaths that follow to exaggerated murder fantasies. Here, gymnast Candice Hooper (Ellen Wroe), fresh off surviving the North Bay Bridge collapse, is swinging on the uneven bars when she gets blinded by the chalk dust blasted in her eye, the result of a fellow gymnast knocking it over after stepping on a falling screw. Unable to gain her balance in mid-air, she falls on her neck, snapping her spine, and dying with her legs twisted over hear ears. In gymnastics, precision isn’t only necessary for entertainment, but also for safety. Only one <em>Final Destination </em>death has felt closer to reality than this iconic one.</p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="5cf6a2070ea49911bab5748caf250cb2" data-recommend-id="image://5cf6a2070ea49911bab5748caf250cb2" data-format="jpg" data-width="600" data-height="316" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Police afraid of an incoming log" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Police afraid of an incoming log" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Warner Bros.

From there, a motorcyclist gets pinned to death between one of the logs and the bike he flew off of, a driver who survived their car flipping over is instantly set on fire when a truck comes barreling through, and waves of other drivers are killed.
