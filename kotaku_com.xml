              <div data-gpnav="columns"> <p id="appHubAppName" role="heading" aria-level="1"><em>New World: Aeternum</em> stood out as an impressive milestone for Amazon Game Studios. A hit MMO at launch, it will now be remembered as an unfortunate sacrifice on the altar of the tech giant’s coming AI transformation. The company has announced that <em>New World</em> <a href="https://kotaku.com/new-world-amazon-mmo-shutting-down-servers-2026-layoffs-new-content-2000639761">will get no more new content</a>. It’s not shutting down this instant, but it seems unlikely to last beyond 2026. Fans are understandably upset, and they’re current plastering the game’s Steam review section with colorful critiques of Amazon.</p> </div> <p role="heading" aria-level="1">A victim of the company’s newly announced retreat from AAA game development as it culls a <a href="https://kotaku.com/amazon-layoffs-lord-rings-mmo-tomb-raider-2000639620">staggering 14,000 employees</a> from its payrolls, <em>New World</em> was deemed “no longer sustainable to continue supporting…with new content updates.” The reaction on the game’s Steam page has been swift, with over 1,000 new negative reviews since Amazon informed fans it was pulling the plug.</p> <p>“Recently started playing was enjoying it, now its being shut down because Amazon being Amazon,” wrote one Steam reviewer. “Recently bought some marks of fortune to buy some in game cosmetics for a game I thought was gonna be a long lasting live-service MMORPG, especially after the general positive reception of <em>Nighthaven</em> and they are shutting down the servers lmao,” wrote another.</p> <p role="heading" aria-level="1">There’s never a good moment to reveal you’re abandoning your flagship MMO, but the news comes just a couple of weeks after the game’s season 10 Nighthaven update went live. That and the <em>Rise of the Angry Earth</em> expansion needed to access it are being made free to all players, but no one who’s recently spent money on the game buying content will be getting any refunds.</p> <p role="heading" aria-level="1">After drifting below 10,000 concurrent players on Steam during the last year,&nbsp;<em>New</em>&nbsp;<em>World</em> saw a decent resurgence this month, peaking at over 50,000 concurrents after the new content went live. Some fans are blaming corporate greed rather than any unique live-service failings on the part of<em> New World</em> and the MMO’s developers.</p> <p data-panel="{&quot;onOKButton&quot;:&quot;UserReviewShowMore( \&quot;207877192\&quot;, \&quot;recent_short\&quot; )&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;PanelGroup&quot;}">“Was fun but then amazon killed it,” a player wrote in the review section. “Bought it the same day the announced it was shutting down, screw you amazon,” wrote another. A third didn’t hold back either. “An amazing game that finally got footing and headwind only to be shutdown because Amazon wants more AI,” they wrote. “No seriously that’s the reason from Amazon for the the mass layoffs that shuttered the studio. Don’t buy it it’ll be shutdown in 8 months.”</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Good morning and good day. Welcome to Wednesday, perhaps the most meh day of the week. You ain’t not Friday, but you aren’t as bad as Monday. Anyway, welcome to latest edition of Morning Checkpoint, <em>Kotaku</em>‘s daily roundup of gaming news and culture. Today, we’re looking at a cool new box set from Nintendo, checking in on the Game Awards, getting updates for games you can’t buy anymore, and remembering how cool <em>Day of the Tentacle</em> was and still is in 2025.</p> <h2>Nintendo’s $180+ <em>Breath of the Wild</em> vinyl soundtrack release is a test</h2> <p>On October 29, Nintendo announced <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/wario64.bsky.social/post/3m4dlbecutr2k">a new 8-LP <em>Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild</em> soundtrack box set</a> featuring 134 remastered songs. The newly announced soundtrack will be available in June 2026 and can be pre-ordered starting today. The box set will also include archival artwork created by the development team.</p>   <p>This is a rare move for Nintendo, which normally doesn’t release physical soundtracks for its games in the United States. But this new box set, as well as a cheaper double LP offering up 34 select tracks from the game, is being used as a way to “gauge” how many people over here want something like this, according to Nintendo.</p>

 <p>“In the Japanese market, CD is still a pretty prominent format there, and they do a lot of video game soundtracks on CD in Japan, and they’ve been doing that for years and years,” Nintendo VP of player &amp; product experience <a href="https://variety.com/2025/gaming/news/legend-of-zelda-breath-of-the-wild-soundtrack-vinyl-1236564363/">Bill Trinen told<em>&nbsp;Variety</em></a>. “Here in the U.S., we haven’t been releasing much in the way of physical soundtracks at all. And so partly, this is a little bit about us trying to gauge and understand what is the demand for physical soundtracks in the United States. Part of this is also simply an interest in trying to bring video game music to a broader audience, and it’s part of a few steps that we’ve taken.”</p> <h2>Apple is now on the Game Awards advisory board</h2> <p>Apple’s gaming push continues, with the tech giant now becoming a member of the Game Awards advisory board alongside companies like Rockstar Games, Sony, EA, and Epic. <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/apple-has-been-appointed-to-the-game-awards-advisory-board/#google_vignette"><em>VGC</em> spotted the news</a> via the <a href="https://thegameawards.com/about">official Game Awards website,</a> which was recently updated to include Apple on the list of board members. To be clear, the advisory board doesn’t have any involvement in what games are nominated, or which ones win. So Apple won’t be helping pick this year’s Game of the Year at Geoff Keighley’s annual trailer extravaganza (featuring some awards), but it will be rubbing elbows with more of the gaming industry. How many Apple Arcade commercials will we see this year? My bet is at least two!</p>

 <h2><em>Super Mario 3D All-Stars</em> gets another Switch 2 update, still not for sale again</h2> <p>Remember <em>Super Mario 3D All-Stars</em>? It was that awesome collection of 3D <em>Mario</em> games<!--StartFragment --><span>—</span><!--EndFragment --><em>SM64, Galaxy, </em>and<em> Sunshine<!--StartFragment --><span>—</span><!--EndFragment --></em>that Nintendo launched in 2020. And then stopped selling after just six months as part of a limited-time celebration of the franchise’s 35th anniversary. Five years later, Nintendo still hasn’t made the games available again to buy on its store (well, except for <em>Galaxy</em> which recently got a remaster that costs $40 all by itself). But if you do own <em>3D All-Stars</em>, good news: It just got another update to help it run better on Switch 2. This keeps happening, <a href="https://kotaku.com/super-mario-3d-all-stars-switch-2-sunshine-gamecube-1851786291">with the collection getting an update in July,</a> and it’s extremely frustrating. Why is this package not available to buy on Switch and Switch 2 in 2025? Come on, Nintendo, let people give you money.</p> <h2>The <em>Resident Evil 2</em> remake has now sold over 16 million copies</h2> <p>The best-selling <em>Resident Evil</em> game continues to sell well.<em> Resident Evil 2</em> remake has now sold over 16 million copies,<a href="https://www.capcom.co.jp/ir/english/data/pdf/explanation/2025/2nd/explanation_2025_2nd_01.pdf"> according to Capcom’s latest financial report.</a> But interestingly, <em>Resident Evil 7 Biohazard</em> is catching up. This latest report shows the soft reboot of the horror franchise has now reached 15.9 million copies sold. With <em>Resident Evil 7</em> <a href="https://www.residentevil.com/switch2/en-us/">making the leap to Switch 2</a> in 2026, it’s likely that this entry might overtake the <em>RE2</em> remake to become the biggest game in the survival horror series.</p> <h2>ICYMI:</h2> <ul> <li><a href="https://kotaku.com/battlefield-6s-new-map-is-very-bad-2000639647"><em>Battlefield 6′</em>s new map isn’t very good and feels too small</a></li> <li><a href="https://kotaku.com/amazon-layoffs-lord-rings-mmo-tomb-raider-2000639620">Amazon is scaling down its gaming plans and laying off thousands</a></li> <li><a href="https://kotaku.com/hollow-knight-silksong-review-hornet-team-cherry-2000639568">Check out our <em>Hollow Knight: Silksong</em> review</a></li> </ul> <h2>Watch This:</h2>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/this-guy-is-the-unsung-hero-of-pok%C3%A9mon-legends-z-a.1338232/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><span>One of the best parts of </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-legends-za-review-switch-2-bugs-performance-2000637719"><i><span>Pokémon Legends: Z-A</span></i></a> <span>is that its single-city setting illustrates the power of community building and the importance of public services. Its cast of trainers come from different walks of life and all contribute something different to Lumiose City. However, we’re not here to talk about the streamer, socialite, or mob boss. We’re here to talk about the true backbone of Lumiose City’s urban redevelopment plan: the Poké Ball Collector.</span></p> <p><span>These unnamed men show up throughout Lumiose, typically next to a Pokémon Center, and if you ever see them with a yellow text bubble above their heads, you should talk to them immediately. See, these handsome gentlemen are part of the city’s clean-up crew, but they focus on a specific type of trash littered around town: Poké Balls. Every time you misthrow one of these capture devices at the local wildlife, these guys are right behind you, collecting these relics of your Pokémon training failures to give them back to you so you don’t have to buy more balls when perfectly good ones are lying around the <a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-legends-za-wild-zone-17-pyroar-alpha-memes-2000639332">Wild Zones</a>.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><span>Crucially, he will only pick up ones that miss their target, not ones that fail to capture a Pokémon because you didn’t weaken them enough in battle. But even so, that’s such a handy quality-of-life change that I’m surprised it took </span><i><span>Pokémon </span></i><span>nearly 30 years to implement. I guess it works best when your game is set in one city, and thus it makes sense to have dedicated systems and workers who can devote their shifts to this. But it’s especially helpful in a </span><i><span>Legends </span></i><span>game in which you throw Poké Balls manually and can miss your target if you’re carelessly tossing them.</span></p>

 <p><span>Now these collectors are amassing a ton of fans, and I wouldn’t be surprised if we saw them featured in other </span><i><span>Pokémon </span></i><span>media moving forward. A guy who picks up garbage and brings it back to you is just waiting for a trading card that lets you pick through your discard pile.</span></p> <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="de" dir="ltr">the true hero of Pokémon Legends: Z-A <a href="https://t.co/zGdGYjNOcs">pic.twitter.com/zGdGYjNOcs</a></p> <p>— Out of Context Pokémon (@OoCPokemon) <a href="https://twitter.com/OoCPokemon/status/1982492422689951862?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 26, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">i am not good at this game <a href="https://t.co/eVJzmun6n3">pic.twitter.com/eVJzmun6n3</a></p> <p>— Dyylas (@DylanDyylas) <a href="https://twitter.com/DylanDyylas/status/1982482065431114123?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 26, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">When nobody else got me I know unnamed ball collector man got me <a href="https://t.co/SjifPJR3zq">https://t.co/SjifPJR3zq</a> <a href="https://t.co/tuPLZWvU8w">pic.twitter.com/tuPLZWvU8w</a></p> <p>— skipppppy 🍉/COMMS OPEN!!/ (@skipppppy_art) <a href="https://twitter.com/skipppppy_art/status/1982051705798656394?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 25, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">EXTREMELY IMPORTANT UPDATE:</p> <p>HIS NAME IS LEANDRO AND HE LIKES ELECTRIC TYPES <a href="https://t.co/eOvZX2exvl">https://t.co/eOvZX2exvl</a> <a href="https://t.co/ttIRJOfVam">pic.twitter.com/ttIRJOfVam</a></p> <p>— skipppppy 🍉/COMMS OPEN!!/ (@skipppppy_art) <a href="https://twitter.com/skipppppy_art/status/1983288380118184043?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 28, 2025</a></p></blockquote>     <p><span>As far as I’m concerned, Poké Ball collectors need to become a new standard for the series alongside Nurse Joy.
