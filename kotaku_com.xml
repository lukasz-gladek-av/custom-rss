              <p><span>Ever since The Pokémon Company </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-pokopia-animal-crossing-switch-2-nintendo-direct-2000625331"><span>announced </span><i><span>Pokémon Pokopia</span></i></a><span>, the </span><i><span>Animal Crossing</span></i><span>-style life sim game has seemed a little off. Your character is helping rebuild a small town so Pokémon can live there, but the space is filled with desecrated buildings, and humans are nowhere to be found. Fans have been speculating that the cozy game might not be so cozy after all, and that it may take place in a </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-pokopia-post-apocalypse-snorlax-pikachu-fuschia-2000644400"><span>post-apocalyptic version of the Kanto region</span></a><span> from the original </span><i><span>Pokémon </span></i><span>games. Now, a leak may have confirmed this.</span></p> <p><span>A leaked map outlines the status of Kanto in </span><i><span>Pokopia</span></i><span>, with descriptions for each “area,” named after the cities and towns that once stood there. A translation posted by Pokémon leak account Centro Leaks describes these desolate areas, and each of them sounds like they’ve succumbed to the elements. Fuschia city, which fans have speculated might be the first area shown in most of </span><i><span>Pokopia</span></i><span>‘s trailers, is said to be “dried up and unfertilized fieldland.” Vermillion City, which was once occupied by Lt. Surge’s electric gym and a harbor city for ships to arrive and depart from, is roughly translated as a “constant raining electrical harbor.”&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><span>The rest of the descriptions sure do make it sound like humanity has been gone for a long time. Saffron City’s metropolitan area is “covered with plants,” Pewter City has been “abandoned” and is covered in rocks, and Lavender Town’s Pokémon Tower is now “rotten” but believed to reach heaven.&nbsp;</span></p> <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">Pokópia is post-apocalyptic Kanto CONFIRMED!</p> <p>➡️ Base game areas:<br>Area 1 – Fuscha Area – Dried up and unfertilized fieldland<br>Area 2 – Vermillion Area – Constant raining electrical harbor<br>Area 3 – Pewter Area – An abandoned mine covered by rocks<br>Area 4 – Saffron Area – Bunch of… <a href="https://t.co/JPySgYGnBW">https://t.co/JPySgYGnBW</a></p> <p>— Centro LEAKS (@CentroLeaks) <a href="https://twitter.com/CentroLeaks/status/1996007165002199320?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 3, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <p><span>Just how much </span><i><span>Pokopia </span></i><span>will reckon with this remains to be seen, but the environment isn’t the only indicator that something terrible happened in Kanto in this game. The game includes </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-pokopia-pikachu-pale-form-peakychu-white-2000644025"><span>new forms for Pikachu, Snorlax, and Smeargle</span></a><span> that have elements to their character design that imply a lot of time has passed since they last interacted with humans. I’m really curious to see how deep this game goes into its tragic “what if” storyline when it comes to Switch 2 on March 5.</span></p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/asus-goes-full-clearance-on-its-graphics-cards-as-the-geforce-rtx-5070-drops-to-a-new-record-low-2000650188</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Those looking to game better or push some creative boundaries this holiday season; we’ve got good news. The top-rated ASUS GeForce RTX 5070 just hit its lowest price ever, and it’s even better than what it dipped to during Black Friday!</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6203/">This graphics card sits at $710, but you can currently grab it for just $570 at Amazon, after the retailer took 20% off its price</a>. The deal is open to all shoppers, and there are no delivery charges to worry about. Even better, this isn’t one of those complicated-to-score discounts. You don’t need to enter any complicated coupon codes or follow long checkout steps to grab the discount. Just throw it in your cart, and the offer applies automatically. The only thing to note is that the retailer has marked the deal as a fast-selling one. That means the stock, or the drop itself, is only going to be around for a short time, and it won’t be long before we see them wrap up. It’s better to act now if you don’t want to run into last-minute disappointments later on.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6203/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Great Visuals, Even Better Performance</h2>
<p>RTX is the most advanced platform for full ray tracing and neural rendering tech that completely upgrades the way you work and play. The graphics card is powered by the NVIDIA Blackwell architecture and DLSS 4, featuring fifth-gen tensor cores for better AI performance, latest streaming multiprocessors that are optimized for neutral shader, and fourth-gen ray tracing cores specifically built for mega geometry. DLSS4 uses AI to boost FPS, reduce latency, and make the overall image quality top-notch, while the Blackwell architecture makes cinematic quality visuals at unbelievable speeds possible.</p>
<p>The 2.5 slot design of the card offers better build compatibility while maintaining cooling performance, regardless of how intense things get. Cooling mechanism includes a premium phase-change GPU thermal pad that softens under heat to fill the gaps between the GPU and thermal module effectively, resulting in superior thermal conductivity and better heat dissipation throughout your sessions. The axial-tech fans come with longer blades, alongside a barrier ring to increase the downward air pressure, while the 0db tech stops the fans automatically when the temperature of the GPU goes 50 degrees. The latter makes it easy to focus on light tasks without any distracting sound, and puts the fans back to work at 55 degrees when things start to heat up. You can also switch between Quiet and Performance BIOS profiles manually; the former offers a calmer operation, while the latter maximizes performance for resource-intensive tasks.</p>



<p>The card comes with a GPU guard that applies adhesive to secure all four corners of the GPU to keep it firmly in place. Dual-ball bearings are designed to last up to twice as long as sleeve bearings, while the protective backplate does a good job of keeping the components safe from external damage. What’s more, the Tuning tool makes overclocking, cooling control, and monitoring the performance of your card a breeze. It even comes with MuseTree, which is an AI-powered image-generation app that gives the creative inside you a boost by letting you create images, manage ideas, and unlock new inspirations as you go.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6203/">You can now grab the graphics card for just $570, after an impressive $140 discount on its retail price of $710.</a> This makes the upgrade much more affordable, but only for a short time. Don’t miss out on the chance to grab it for less, as this is one of the lowest prices we have seen the card drop to.</p>

              <p><span>God, Nintendo can be an annoying company. Not 24 hours ago, I was writing about how it made </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/mario-kart-world-update-1-4-0-patch-notes-track-volume-2000650066"><i><span>Mario Kart World</span></i><span>’s music volume options a toggle</span></a><span> that only let you choose between “normal” and “louder,” and now </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/metroid-prime-4-reviews-is-it-good-switch-2-nintendo-2000649621"><i><span>Metroid Prime 4: Beyond</span></i></a> <span>is out today and has its own obnoxious music options for players to contend with. At least </span><i><span>Mario Kart World</span></i><span>’s nonsense came at no additional cost to you. </span><i><span>Metroid</span></i><span> has paywalled basic options and features behind $30 amiibo figures.</span></p> <p><span>One of the big additions to </span><i><span>Metroid Prime 4 </span></i><span>is an open-world hub space that Samus travels through on a super cool motorcycle. Unfortunately, this area is pretty lifeless, and you only really have the rattle and hum of Samus’ bike to accompany its desolate, isolating vibes.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><span>There’s some ambient music in the background, but it’s certainly not doing much to make these sections exciting. Some open-world games, like </span><i><span>Grand Theft Auto </span></i><span>or </span><i><span>Cyberpunk 2077</span></i><span>, let you turn on a radio station while traveling to make driving segments more stimulating, but </span><i><span>Metroid Prime 4 </span></i><span>has no such option…unless you buy the </span><i><span>Metroid Prime 4 </span></i><span>Samus amiibo.</span></p>

 <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">Let me get this straight: If you pay $29.99 for the collectible Samus amiibo in <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/MetroidPrime4?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#MetroidPrime4</a>  you get to play/select music while driving the Vi-O-La bike in the otherwise quiet desert… In other words: They locked MUSIC while riding through a desert behind a $30 paywall… Am… <a href="https://t.co/qmFRbvdNhR">https://t.co/qmFRbvdNhR</a></p> <p>— Luke Stephens (@LukeStephens) <a href="https://twitter.com/LukeStephens/status/1996340617497227440?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 3, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <p><span>The figure allows you to change the music while riding your motorcycle, and paywalling such a basic feature would be maddening if it weren’t also one of the most Nintendo-ass decisions the company could have made. I think I’m more impressed by the new ways it finds to be obtuse than anything.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><span>Amiibo figures, small figurines of characters that unlock things when you tap them on a Nintendo game system were first introduced in 2014 for the Wii U and 3DS, and have always come with bonus in-game rewards that were, often items or cosmetics. Gating features that would be standard in most games is so weirdly hostile that I’m surprised Nintendo gets away with it.</span></p> <figure id="attachment_2000650512" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000650512"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000650512">© Nintendo</figcaption></figure> <p><span>For whatever it’s worth, the Samus amiibo looks great, but do keep in mind it’s not to be confused with the </span><i><span>other</span></i><span> Samus figure that includes her bike. That one won’t let you change the music; instead, it will let you change the motorcycle’s color and see how much you’ve traveled on your chopper. Good thing these things look pretty on a shelf. I’m trying to imagine what would happen if any other company charged $30 for baseline functionality. It probably wouldn’t go well!</span></p>
