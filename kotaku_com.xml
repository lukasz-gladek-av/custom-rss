              <p><span>It’s been months since Epic Games <a href="https://kotaku.com/horses-creepy-horror-game-steam-banned-before-launch-santa-ragione-2000647324">removed <em>Horses</em> from its PC storefront</a> and the two sides are still feuding about what exactly took place. Developer Santa Ragione claims it was ghosted by Epic while the </span><i><span>Fortnite </span></i><span>maker claims it’s been transparent throughout the process. Now Santa Ragione’s co-founder and studio director, Pietro Righi Riva, has responded to the response to the response, claiming Epic Games’ “vague and semi-automated statements” provided little in the way of meaningful feedback about why</span><i><span> Horses </span></i><span>was removed from the storefront.</span></p> <p><span>This latest chapter in the ongoing censorship fight began with </span><a href="https://www.gamefile.news/p/epic-has-many-plans-for-its-game?open=false#%C2%A7a-note-about-horses"><i><span>Game File’s</span></i></a><span> February 5 interview with Epic Games, in which it asked VP Steve Allison why the game was taken down. “My understanding is the trust and safety team thought </span><i><span>[Horses</span></i><span>] was worth taking a fresh look, and they determined that it indeed was against our policies on a couple fronts,” Allison said. “And so, the call came late—and we love that studio; we did their previous game as a short exclusive—but because that [trust and safety] team, that’s their job and that is, if you do the letter of the law on our policies, it is what it is.”</span></p>

 <p><span>For context, Epic Games’ content ratings </span><a href="https://dev.epicgames.com/docs/epic-games-store/requirements-guidelines/content-ratings/content-guidelines"><span>guidelines</span></a><span> state that games “with Adults Only (AO) ratings cannot be distributed on the Epic Games Store.” They do make an exception for games that only carry AO ratings “because they use blockchain, NFT, or cryptocurrency technology.” </span><i><span>Horses </span></i><span>is also not available through Steam for similar reasoning, but can be purchased on GoG and itch.io.&nbsp;</span></p> <div><blockquote data-bluesky-uri="at://did:plc:5w4wqifosubfhezsqepobxtn/app.bsky.feed.post/3mebdquhjts2k" data-bluesky-cid="bafyreieobrr7wsfjrlwzargszax3mipgo43vus3xdgurceeb4qayvzrpxq"> <p lang="en">Epic made provably incorrect statements about the game’s content, refused to provide details supporting their claims, and has not shared their claimed AO IARC certificate, which normally includes a link for the developer to appeal. They do not ‘love that studio’, they have effectively ghosted us</p> <p>— <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/did:plc:5w4wqifosubfhezsqepobxtn?ref_src=embed">Santa Ragione (@santaragione.com)</a> <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/did:plc:5w4wqifosubfhezsqepobxtn/post/3mebdquhjts2k?ref_src=embed">2026-02-07T11:44:28.467Z</a></p></blockquote></div>  <p><span>On February 7, Santa Ragione rejected Allison’s claim in a post </span><a href="https://bsky.app/profile/santaragione.com/post/3mebdquhjts2k"><span>on Bluesky</span></a><span>. “Epic made provably incorrect statements about the game’s content, refused to provide details supporting their claims, and has not shared their claimed AO IARC certificate, which normally includes a link for the developer to appeal. They do not ‘love that studio’, they have effectively ghosted us,” stated Santa Ragione.</span></p>

 <p><span>Today, Epic Games followed up on Santa Ragione’s post in a statement to several publications, including </span><i><span>IGN </span></i><span>and </span><i><span>PC Gamer</span></i><span>. “Our team played the game and found it violated the Epic Games Store’s Content Guidelines, specifically the ‘Inappropriate Content’ and ‘Hateful or Abusive Content’ policies,” communications manager Brian Sharon said.</span></p>

 <p><span>“We did a secondary check by filling out the ratings questionnaire for the game ourselves and the content got an Adults Only (AO) rating – which we do not allow on the Store. Because this wasn’t an official submission, we do not have a certificate to share with the team. We did give the developers context around the policies they violated. When they appealed, we reviewed the content again, and let them know the decision was appropriately applied and will remain in place.”</span></p> <h2>A cloud of confusion still hangs over <em>Horses</em>‘ last-minute rejection</h2> <p><i><span>Kotaku </span></i><span>reached out to Santa Ragione for clarification regarding the “incorrect statements” they alluded to in their initial Bluesky post. “On Dec 1, 24 hours before release, Epic sent us what looked like an automated notice saying that they were unable to distribute </span><i><span>Horses</span></i><span> on the Epic Games Store because their review found violations of the Epic Games Store Content Guidelines, specifically the ‘Inappropriate Content’ and ‘Hateful or Abusive Content’ policies,” replied Pietro Righi Riva. “They went on to specify that their policies prohibit content which ‘contains explicit or frequent depictions of sexual behavior or not appropriately labeled, rated, or age-gated,’ and content that promotes abuse and animal abuse.”</span></p>

 <p><span>Riva further explained that they responded to Epic Games’ first notice to appeal within “28 minutes,” on the basis that “all nudity in the game is completely censored via pixelation” and that “the content presented does not in any way promote abuse and animal abuse.” After Epic Games’ second review of </span><i><span>Horses</span></i><span>, Riva told us that “No additional information or context was ever provided. We emailed them twice since to plead for a resubmission and find a solution but never received a reply.”</span></p> <p><span>“I do not think that those two vague and semi-automated statements would qualify as ‘contacting us twice.’ Their initial message suggested there was a path to ‘make updates to our product to ensure compliance’ but never explained what that would entail or what specifically needed change in the first place,” Riva concluded.</span></p> <p><span><em>Horses</em> has received </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/horses-review-steam-epic-games-ban-horror-ride-race-2000651442"><span>a range of reviews</span></a><span> since it launched, but one thing many critics seems to agree on is that there is nothing in the game nearly as scandalous as Epic and Valve banning it would imply. Adding to the confusion and skepticism is that PC gaming storefronts have been under extra pressure recently from payment processers at the behest of pro-censorship activists to crackdown on NSFW content. For all the controversy, Epic and other storefronts still haven’t made it clear precisely what they found so objectionable about the content in</span><i><span> Horses</span></i><span>.&nbsp; </span></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-lego-sets-release-date-price-pikachu-charizard-2000658895"><i><span>Pokémon’s</span></i><span> first Lego sets</span></a><span> are launching later this month for the series’ 30th anniversary, but some reviewers and creators have gotten early access to the sets and are building them for coverage. These models are made up of hundreds or thousands of pieces, and sometimes, Lego sneaks an easter egg or two into the build. This is the case with the </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-year-of-eevee-prismatic-evolutions-plush-1851732914"><span>Eevee</span></a><span> model, which has a hidden reference to the Pokémon’s various evolutions.</span></p> <p><span>Eevee’s whole schtick is that it’s able to evolve into one of several evolutions depending on certain conditions, including the time of day, the use of a certain evolution stone, or whether or not it knows a Fairy-type move. Each form is pretty distinct, with each carrying a different color scheme, elemental theme, and shape. While Eevee’s eight evolutions aren’t getting their own Lego sets (yet), the Eevee model’s innards are a nod to each of them.</span></p>

   <p><span>As TikToker and Lego creator Bricks By Mind demonstrates, the inside of the Eevee model includes colored bricks that correspond to each of its evolutions. Parts of it are made up of yellow, orange, and blue bricks that resemble the colors of the electric Jolteon, flaming Flareon, and water-wielding Vaporeon, respectively. Meanwhile, the inside of the head has a brick for each of the other evolutions stacked next to one another behind its eyes. This includes the aforementioned three, but also blocks for the Ice-type Glaceon, Grass-type Leafeon, Psychic-type Espeon, Dark-type Umbreon, and Fairy-type Sylveon. It’s a neat touch.</span></p> <p><span>Thankfully, the Eevee model is the cheapest of the </span><i><span>Pokemon </span></i><span>Lego sets, and will only run you $59.99 compared to the $200 Pikachu one, or the staggering $649.99 you’ll have to pay for the Charizard, Venusaur, and Blastoise one, when they all launch on February 27.</span></p>

            <title><![CDATA[Atreus And Everyone Cast In The God Of War TV Show (So Far)]]></title>
            <link>https://kotaku.com/god-of-war-amazon-show-cast-kratos-atreus-mimir-actor-2000666932</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><span>Amazon is making a live-action adaptation of </span><i><span>God of War</span></i><span>, specifically the 2018 game set in Norse mythology. The show hasn’t begun shooting yet, but the casting announcements are trickling out as Amazon and Sony prepare to move ahead with production. Some actors fans will recognize from other shows and movies as well as the games, but so far only one is reprising their role from the actual Santa Monica Studio’s franchise. Let’s run down who we know is in the</span><i><span> God of War </span></i><span>TV show thus far.</span></p> <h2><b>Ryan Hurst as Kratos</b></h2>  <p><span>Leading the show will be </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/god-of-war-live-action-series-amazon-kratos-ryan-hurst-2000659874"><span>Ryan Hurst as the god of war himself</span></a><span>. Hurst played Thor in the games, so he’s familiar with the source material, though the familiar casting wasn’t without </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/god-of-war-casting-kratos-ryan-hurst-amazon-tv-series-2000660584"><span>a little bit of controversy</span></a><span>, as this will be the first time Kratos is not portrayed by a Black actor. Outside of playing Thor in </span><i><span>Ragnarok</span></i><span>, Hurst has also played Opie in </span><i><span>Sons of Anarchy</span></i><span> and Beta in the </span><i><span>Walking Dead </span></i><span>franchise. Most recently, he has played Miles in the new Netflix western series </span><i><span>The Abandons</span></i><span>.</span></p>

 <h2><b>Callum Vinson as Atreus</b></h2>  <p><span>The co-lead of the series will be child actor Callum Vinson as Kratos’ son Atreus. One of Vinson’s most high-profile roles hasn’t actually premiered yet. He’s playing a young Jason Vorhees in </span><i><span>Crystal Lake</span></i><span>, a </span><i><span>Friday the 13th </span></i><span>prequel coming to Peacock later this year. But beyond that, he’s also appeared in series like </span><i><span>Poker Face</span></i><span>, </span><i><span>Chucky</span></i><span>, and voiced Piglet in recent iterations of </span><i><span>Winnie the Pooh</span></i><span>. That’s a pretty decent resume for someone so young.</span></p> <h2><b>Alastair Duncan as Mimir</b></h2>  <p><span>One of the other game actors coming back to </span><i><span>God of War </span></i><span>for the show is Mimir actor Alastair Duncan, who is, thus far, the only performer reprising their existing role from the games for the show. Duncan’s voice performance was already one of the stand-outs in the </span><i><span>God of War </span></i><span>games, so I’m sure he’ll crush it again on TV.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <h2><b>Danny Woodburn and Jeff Gulka as Brok and Sindri</b></h2>  <p><span>Rounding out our known heroes are Danny Woodburn and Jeff Gulka as the bickering dwarven brothers Brok and Sindri, respectively. Woodburn has been in shows like </span><i><span>Seinfeld</span></i><span>, </span><i><span>Conan the Adventurer</span></i><span>, </span><i><span>Bones</span></i><span>, and recently appeared as Zoltan in Netflix’s </span><i><span>Witcher </span></i><span>series. Gulka, meanwhile, has worked on shows like </span><i><span>X-Files </span></i><span>and </span><i><span>Stargate</span></i><span>.</span></p>

  <h2><b>Max Parker as Heimdall</b></h2>  <p><span>It looks like the show will be playing with the timeline of the games a bit, as Heimdall is set to appear in the first season, though he didn’t appear in the games until </span><i><span>Ragnarok</span></i><span>. </span><i><span>Boots </span></i><span>actor Max Parker will portray the evil bastard. He has also led </span><i><span>Vampire Academy </span></i><span>and </span><i><span>Blood, Sex &amp; Royalty</span></i><span>.&nbsp;</span></p> <h2><b>Ólafur Darri Ólafsson as Thor</b></h2>  <p><span>With Hurst playing Kratos this time around, someone else has to pick up Mjölnir for the show. Icelandic actor Ólafur Darri Ólafsson will portray the god of thunder. </span><i><span>Severance </span></i><span>fans will likely recognize him as Mr. Drummond, where he was a very intimidating presence throughout the second season. Not a bad pick for </span><i><span>God of War</span></i><span>’s version of Thor.</span></p>

 <h2><b>Mandy Patinkin as Odin</b></h2>  <p><span>Odin, who, again, was an enigma throughout the first Norse </span><i><span>God of War</span></i><span>, will be showing up early in the Amazon series, as well. Storied actor Mandy Patinkin will be playing the all-father, and I’m eager to see him fill the shoes left by Richard Schiff, who played him in </span><i><span>Ragnarok</span></i><span>. Patinkin, on top of having a long history in theater collaborating with legends like Andrew Lloyd Webber, has also been in plenty of films and television across his decades-long career, including his iconic role as Inigo Montoya in </span><i><span>The Princess Bride</span></i><span>.</span></p> <h2><b>Teresa Palmer as Sif</b></h2>  <p><i><span>Warm Bodies </span></i><span>actor Teresa Palmer has joined the cast as Sif, the wife of Thor and mother of Magni, Modi, and Thrúd. Palmer has most recently led the TV series </span><i><span>The Last Anniversary</span></i><span>, </span><i><span>Mix Tape</span></i><span>, and </span><i><span>The Family Next Door </span></i><span>last year.</span></p> <p><span>That’s all we know so far, but if you’ve played the Norse </span><i><span>God of War</span></i><span> games, you know they’re packed with characters. We still haven’t heard who’s being cast for Freya, Baldur, Angrboda, and many, many others. The </span><i><span>God of War </span></i><span>show is currently in pre-production, with the 2018 game’s director Cory Barlog on board as an executive producer, but there’s no set release date yet.</span></p>
