              <p>Cutting the cord on cable TV has never been easier, but choosing the right streaming device can feel overwhelming with so many options flooding the market. Amazon launched its Fire TV Stick lineup years ago to compete directly with established players like Roku and Google’s Chromecast, and the battle for your living room has been fierce ever since.</p>
<p>Here’s the twist: while Amazon’s own <a href="https://kotaku.com/amazon-just-launched-new-gadgets-yet-the-fire-tv-stick-4k-is-practically-free-at-50-off-2000630324">Fire TV Sticks are hitting record low prices</a> during Prime Big Deal Days, <strong>the retail giant is pushing Roku devices even lower</strong> to clear out remaining inventory from its biggest rival. The Roku Streaming Stick HD has dropped from $29 down to $17, the Streaming Stick 4K fell from $49 to $29, and the Streaming Stick Plus landed at $24 instead of $39.</p>

<h2>Understanding the Differences in Roku’s Lineup of Streaming Sticks</h2>
<p>The <strong>entry-level Roku Streaming Stick HD</strong> is the least costly model at $17, ideal if <strong>you’re working with an older TV that tops off at 1080p resolution</strong> or just don’t worry about 4K content. It streams high-definition content effortlessly on all major platforms such as Netflix, Hulu, HBO Max and thousands of other channels. Its included Roku Voice Remote allows you to search for shows by speaking instead of painstakingly entering using an on-screen keyboard, averting frustration when you’re trying to locate that one film whose name you just couldn’t quite manage to recall. It hooks up via HDMI and is powered from your TV’s USB port or from the included adapter.</p>



<p>Upgrading from the base model to the <strong>Roku Streaming Stick 4K</strong> for $29 unlocks significant visual gains if you own a 4K TV. This model is HDR (High Dynamic Range) and Dolby Vision capable, two technologies that achieve massive picture quality improvements beyond resolution bumps. HDR provides greater dynamic range between blacks and whites which results in more realistic pictures with higher-contrast levels. Dolby Vision does one better and adjusts brightness and colour dynamically on a scene- or even frame-by-frame basis, and it looks fantastic in supported content from services like Apple TV Plus, Netflix, and Disney Plus. Long-range Wi-Fi in the specs means that this stick should maintain stable connections even if your router is in another room or on another floor, reducing infuriating buffering that ruins key narrative points.</p>
<p>The <strong>Streaming Stick Plus</strong> at $24 is a tempting compromise with 4K and HDR support but no support for Dolby Vision, so it is relatively less capable in its ultimate picture quality compared to the Streaming Stick 4K, but importantly still much more capable compared to the HD-only base model. There is only real-world practical differentiation in the non-Dolby Vision versus HDR pictures largely on high-end TVs with excellent panel technology, so if your 4K TV is an economy or mid-range model from several years ago, you’re unlikely to see much differentiation in the pictures versus the Plus model and the full 4K model. The Plus model does, however, come with the Voice Remote and has the same massive library of streaming services, free live TV services in the form of the Roku Channel, and private listening in the form of the Roku smartphone app.</p>
<p>Each of these three models gives you access to the Roku platform which is still one of the best streaming interfaces. Installation takes just a minute or two: <strong>stick the stick in your TV’s HDMI port, connect it to your network and start viewing</strong>. compact size makes these sticks disappear completely behind your television with no apparent clutter.</p>
<p>With these aggressive discounts and the fact that non-Prime members have access to these deals, now is truly the perfect time to upgrade your streaming setup.</p>

              <p>Gaming laptops usually come at high prices, and for anything decent in the market below $1,500, it’s like looking for a needle in a haystack. These systems have powerful hardware to support demanding games and creative tasks and that’s why they’re normally that costly. But if you need the best of everything without wasting your savings, Amazon’s <em>Prime Big Deal Days</em> is the place to make it happen.</p>
<p>This Lenovo gaming laptop that is equipped with an <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4489/">AMD Ryzen 5 7535HS processor, 40GB DDR5 RAM, and 1TB PCIe SSD is literally amazing today: It was lowered from its regular price of $1,699 to only $649</a>, translating to a <strong>massive 62% off</strong> and setting an all-time low for the configuration.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4489/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Gaming That Challenges Higher-End Machines in Performance</h2>
<p>The AMD Ryzen 5 7535HS processor is the power behind this laptop’s fantasstic performance. With <strong>6 cores and 12 threads running at 3.3GHz base clocks that turbo up to 4.55GHz</strong>, this chip edges ahead of Intel’s i7-11800H in several use cases. What does it mean for you? High-definition video editing becomes doable instead of infuriating, programming development environments launch and respond quickly even with multiple programs launched at once and tasks such as rendering in interior design or 3D modeling become doable. The 3MB L2 cache and 16MB L3 cache enable the processor to quickly call up frequently used data and minimize lag when you’re in the middle of intense multitasking sessions.</p>



<p>Complementing this processor is <strong>40GB of DDR5 SDRAM</strong> which is a huge improvement from previous DDR4 technology. DDR5 is faster for data transfer and more efficient with power so your laptop stays cooler and more quickly processes information. With 40GB readily available, you can use memory-intensive programs such as <a href="https://gizmodo.com/download/adobe-premiere-pro">Adobe Premiere</a>, <a href="https://gizmodo.com/download/adobe-photoshop">Photoshop</a>, or several virtual machines and never see slowdowns. <a href="https://gizmodo.com/download/google-chrome">Chrome</a> users who have dozens of tabs up will love never again confronting that nasty “page unresponsive” message. The <strong>1TB PCIe NVMe SSD is storage that is blazingly fast</strong>, boots Windows in seconds, loads games near-instantly, and leaves you plenty of space for your entire game library.</p>



<p>The 15.3-inch display provides 1920×1200 resolution for a little more vertical screen real estate compared to typical Full HD displays. This additional vertical screen real estate is priceless when editing documents. Color accuracy is ensured from wide viewing angles with the IPS panel and you work just fine in brightly lit rooms or in front of windows due to the 300 nits brightness rating. Eye strain is lessened during long gaming sessions or working marathons with the anti-glare finish. With 45% NTSC color gamut coverage and a refresh rate of 60Hz, the display navigates daily gaming effortlessly. C<strong>asual to intense gaming, esports games, and creative programs are taken in their stride by the built-in AMD Radeon 660M processor</strong>.</p>
<p>Port selection accounts for all contingencies: two USB-A ports functioning at USB 3.2 Gen 1 levels (5Gbps) for the traditional accessories, one USB-C that doubles for both USB Power Delivery 3.0 for fast charging and DisplayPort 1.2 for attaching high-resolution external displays, an HDMI 1.4 for more display connections, a headphone jack for audio equipment and an SD card slot for speedy file imports from cameras.</p>
<p>Windows 11 Professional is backed up by enterprise-grade features such as BitLocker encryption and remote desktop, while the built-in Copilot AI PC feature is your intelligent aide available from its dedicated keyboard shortcut. There is even a 720p HD camera that has a privacy shutter for users who value their security.</p>
<p>With this Prime Day deal on Amazon, you’re getting gaming-level performance at a cost below that of the majority of business budget laptops.</p>
