The free-to-play third-person hero shooter has quickly become one of the biggest games of the year, with hundreds of thousands of players logging in every day, just on Steam alone. And now, just a few weeks after launch, developer NetEase has announced the first major in-game event for <em>Marvel Rivals</em>, and as you might expect, it’s Christmas-themed. </p><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://youtu.be/Be5Err7ygLs&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://youtu.be/Be5Err7ygLs" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">On December 16, NetEase released a trailer</a></span> for “The Winter Celebration,” a new update arriving on all platforms.

That trailer contains four Jeff the Landsharks fighting four other Jeffs in a mode that seems tailored to annoy people who hate this tiny healer. Meanwhile, as someone who loves Jeff and plays with him a lot, I’m very excited about this new mode and Jeff’s adorable ski outfit. </p><p>Interestingly, this new limited-time holiday mode looks to basically be a knock-off version of Nintendo’s <em>Splatoon</em>. Four Jeffs take on four other Jeffs to spray snow across the map and try to cover as much of it as they can before the time runs out. So it looks like NetEase is willing to pull from other games beyond <em>Overwatch </em>for “inspiration.” </p><p> .<br></p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Read on for a recap of everything we’ve gleaned thus far about Naughty Dog’s next game.</p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="195928" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="How Alan Wake 2 Builds Upon The 'Remedy-Verse'" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="190" data-playlist="195928,195922,196345" data-current="195928"><div><p>How Alan Wake 2 Builds Upon The 'Remedy-Verse'</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195928/195928_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195928/195928_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195928/195928_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195928/195928_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/21446.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><h2 id="h10344"><a id=""></a><strong>What is <em>Intergalactic: The Heretic Prophet</em> about?</strong></h2><p><em>Intergalactic </em>follows a space-faring bounty hunter named Jordan A. Mun who ends up stranded on a planet called Sempiria. Communication with the planet has been dark for over 600 years, and no one has left its orbit in all that time. Jordan goes to Sempiria in search of members of the Five Aces crime syndicate, apparently because she’s in desperate need of the bounty. They seemingly have history, as in Jordan’s ship, we see a photo of her and what appears to be other members of the group, though the specifics of her relationship with them are unconfirmed. Once she reaches the planet’s surface, she’s faced by hostile robots and likely other dangers.</p><p>That’s the gist of what we know of the main plot, but as far as the larger world of <em>Intergalactic</em>, director Neil Druckmann explained to <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/12/arts/intergalactic-heretic-prophet-naughty-dog-druckmann.html&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/12/arts/intergalactic-heretic-prophet-naughty-dog-druckmann.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>The New York Times</em></a></span><em> </em>that Jordan’s story will also include some kind of fictional religion at the center and explore “what happens when you put your faith in different institutions.” Druckmann also said that <em>Intergalactic </em>takes place in an alternate future in which space travel had become pretty advanced by the 1980s. That’s why you’ll notice several retrofuturistic elements in Jordan’s space ship, including a CD player on which she spins “It’s a Sin” by the Pet Shop Boys and a CRT television on which she watches anime.</p><p><em>Intergalactic</em>’s reveal trailer definitely feels like it’s cut from the same cloth as <em>Uncharted </em>and <em>The Last of Us</em> in terms of being a “prestige” cinematic story-driven game, and Druckmann says much of the team’s inspiration came from anime like <em>Akira </em>and <em>Cowboy Bebop</em>. Fans have even noted that some details in the trailer appear to be homages to <em>Akira</em>, from Jordan’s red jacket to the CD player in her ship.</p><h2 id="h10345"><a id=""></a><strong>Who’s involved?</strong></h2><p>While we only know the broad strokes of the game’s story and haven’t seen any actual gameplay yet, we do know a fair number of the key personnel attached to <em>Intergalactic</em>. Druckmann is the creative director after leading both <em>The Last of Us </em>games and <em>Uncharted 4</em>, with Naughty Dog veterans Matthew Gallant and Kurt Margenau both acting as game directors.</p><p>Jordan is played by actor Tati Gabrielle, who Naughty Dog fans may recognize from her role in the <em>Uncharted </em>movie as mercenary leader Jo Braddock, a character who kinda felt like a stand-in for <em>Uncharted 4</em> and <em>Lost Legacy</em>’s antagonist-turned-ally Nadine Ross. By the time <em>Intergalactic </em>is out, fans will likely be even more acquainted with her, as she plays Nora in <em>The Last of Us</em>’ upcoming second season.</p><p>Outside of Gabrielle, we know a few other actors who will make an appearance in <em>Intergalactic</em>. Halley Gross, the co-writer and narrative lead on <em>The Last of Us Part II</em>, will play AJ, Jordan’s agent, as seen in the announcement trailer. <em>The Big Sick </em>and <em>Eternals </em>actor Kumail Nanjiani will appear as Colin Graves, one of the Five Aces Jordan is hunting. <em>Better Call Saul </em>actor Tony Dalton is also playing a member of the Five Aces, but the character’s name is unknown right now. Troy Baker, who plays Joel in <em>The Last of Us </em>games and <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/the-last-of-us-ep-8-david-scott-shepherd-nolan-north-1850181044&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/the-last-of-us-ep-8-david-scott-shepherd-nolan-north-1850181044">James in the HBO series</a></span>, is also <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/troy-baker-neil-druckmann-naughty-dog-indiana-jones-1851707293&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/troy-baker-neil-druckmann-naughty-dog-indiana-jones-1851707293">confirmed to play a character in <em>Intergalactic</em></a></span>.</p><p>Lastly, the duo of Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross are composing music for the game. The two have written countless scores for films over the years, with some recent standouts including <em>Challengers </em>and <em>Queer</em>. This marks their first time working on a video game score together.</p><h2 id="h10346"><a id=""></a><strong>What’s the plan for the future?</strong></h2><p>Druckmann told <em>The New York Times</em> that Naughty Dog had been restructured as “an IP powerhouse” following <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/sony-playstation-layoffs-london-studio-closure-1851289547&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/sony-playstation-layoffs-london-studio-closure-1851289547">layoffs</a></span> over the past year, and the studio is aiming for <em>Intergalactic </em>to become a big new franchise for PlayStation. Whether or not that comes to pass will depend on how the first game does, but given Sony’s propensity to milk games for spin-offs and external media, I wouldn’t doubt that Sony wants <em>Intergalactic </em>to spawn sequels and maybe some TV or movie adaptations. Naughty Dog is already <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.naughtydog.com/blog/intergalactic_the_heretic_prophet_announcement&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.naughtydog.com/blog/intergalactic_the_heretic_prophet_announcement" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">presenting the game as a “franchise”</a></span> in its official announcement, so it sounds like expectations for this one are pretty high. We’ll see how it all pans out at some point in the coming months or years, as right now we don’t know when <em>Intergalactic </em>will actually make its way to our PlayStation 5s.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Following the reveal of the game’s first trailer at The Game Awards 2024 last week, the studio confirmed that the character’s previous actor,  Jo Wyatt, has been replaced by Ciara Berkeley. She performs the role in the new trailer and will be Ciri’s voice for the entire game, and potentially any further sequels. <br></p><p>  “Ciara Berkeley was cast as Ciri for <em>The Witcher IV </em>Cinematic Reveal Trailer,” a CDPR spokesperson told <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.thegamer.com/the-witcher-4-ciri-voice-actor-jo-wyatt-recast-rumours/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.thegamer.com/the-witcher-4-ciri-voice-actor-jo-wyatt-recast-rumours/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>The Gamer</em></a></span> in a statement. “Ciara is a talented actress who impressed us with her enthusiasm and vocal acting skills, and in this trailer we believe she truly brought Ciri to life in a way that is both faithful to the character and exciting for fans of the series.”</p><p>Ciri, a princess with mystical blood and magic powers turned witcher under the tutelage of her adopted family, was playable at various points in<em> The Witcher 3</em> as Geralt tried to track her down amid an impending interdimensional apocalypse. She was still a young person growing up throughout her journey, with the 2015 blockbuster serving as a sort of coming-of-age tale for her. </p><p>In <em>The Witcher 4</em> trailer, Ciri’s tone is much less innocent, hopeful, and enthusiastic. Now a veteran monster slayer in her own right, she sounds hardened by the cruel world around her and the burden of constantly making the “lesser of two evil” trade-offs that the games and the Polish fantasy novels they’re adapted from are known for. Berkeley performs the role well, though I’ll miss Wyatt for sure. </p><p>Geralt, on the other hand, who is voiced by Doug Cockle across the existing <em>Witcher</em> trilogy, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/witcher-4-geralt-ciri-open-world-rpg-trailer-voice-date-1851720593&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/witcher-4-geralt-ciri-open-world-rpg-trailer-voice-date-1851720593">will return in some form</a></span> with the same actor at the helm.

But worry not, <em>Silo</em> fans: the superb adaptation of Hugh Howey’s novels has been <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.gamesradar.com/entertainment/sci-fi-shows/hit-apple-tv-plus-show-silo-gets-renewed-for-two-final-seasons-to-tell-the-complete-story-of-hugh-howeys-sci-fi-book-series/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.gamesradar.com/entertainment/sci-fi-shows/hit-apple-tv-plus-show-silo-gets-renewed-for-two-final-seasons-to-tell-the-complete-story-of-hugh-howeys-sci-fi-book-series/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">officially confirmed</a></span> for a full four-season run.</p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="197298" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="Live Forever in the Universe of 'New World: Aeternum'" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="108" data-playlist="197298,197284,197260" data-current="197298"><div><p>Live Forever in the Universe of 'New World: Aeternum'</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197298/197298_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197298/197298_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197298/197298_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197298/197298_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"></video></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>First self-published in 2011, Hugh Howey’s short story “Wool” became a word-of-mouth phenomenon. Eventually spawning three novels known as the Silo series, these are the basis for Apple’s <em>Silo</em>, the story of a post-apocalyptic society living in a colossal underground—well—silo. Written by <em>Justified</em>’s Graham Yost, and starring Rebecca Ferguson (<em>Dune</em>), David Oyelowo and Tim Robbins, its second season is currently being released weekly on Apple TV+, and damn, it’s so good.</p><p>While the timing might seem a little awkward given the similarity of <em>Silo</em>’s setting to <em>Fallout</em>’s post-disaster underground societies, the two shows play out very differently. While Amazon’s <em>Fallout</em> adaptation has certainly given more attention to bunker life than the games usually do, <em>Silo</em> doesn’t afford anyone the option to go outside. Any who try are seen falling dead only moments after committing the heinous heresy of leaving the silo.</p><p>The result is utterly compelling, the complex nature of the hierarchical systems of the silo existing in conflict with the mysteries that lie behind its walls (and mirrors),  all oriented around Ferguson’s Juliette Nichols. She’s a mechanic, born high up but living down low, unable to escape the consequences of her parents’ actions, and unafraid of the blasphemy rules around owning “old tech,” essentially anything with a CPU.</p><p>I love it. Having read the short story so long ago, the show has offered the most extraordinary realization of the scenario, with stunning performances, beautiful direction, and the most incredible set design. Given recent trends, I’d normally know better than to get attached to such an excellent sci-fi show!</p><h2 id="h2059"><a id=""></a>It’s tough to be sci-fi</h2><p>It’s been a brutal couple of years for fantasy and sci-fi fans. Netflix cancelled <em>Shadow and Bone</em>, <em>Welcome to Eden</em>, <em>1899</em>, and <em>Kaos</em>, while Disney+ snuffed out <em>The Acolyte</em>, and Apple TV+ barely gave the adored <em>Time Bandits</em> a chance to shine, as well as killing off <em>Constellation</em>. Let alone <em>What We Do in the Shadows</em>, <em>Superman &amp; Lois</em>, <em>Andor</em>, <em>Arcane</em>, <em>The Boys</em>, and <em>The Umbrella Academy </em>all coming to intended ends either now or next season. It’s becoming a real issue that <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://variety.com/2023/tv/news/frequent-tv-series-cancellations-affect-viewership-1235553780/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://variety.com/2023/tv/news/frequent-tv-series-cancellations-affect-viewership-1235553780/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">people just aren’t watching new streaming shows</a></span> because the chances of them getting canceled are so high, it’s not worth the emotional investment.</p><p>So it’s a real joy to learn that Apple has renewed <em>Silo</em>, not just for a third season  but for a fourth as well, with the intention that the show wrap up at that point. After all, by then it’ll have run out of books and short stories to adapt.</p><p>In Apple’s press release, the company quotes series creator Graham Yost explaining, “With the final two chapters of <em>Silo</em>, we can’t wait to give fans of the show an incredibly satisfying conclusion to the many mysteries and unanswered questions contained within the walls of these silos.” Which is another enormous relief, given how this isn’t a <em>Lost</em> or a <em>From</em>—not getting answers here, when they’re tangibly available to those in the know, would be agony. (Or you could read the books, I suppose.)</p><p>Ferguson, who not only does the vast amount of the show’s heavy lifting through her astonishing performance, is also a hands-on executive producer on the program. She adds, in rather unfortunate press-release-ese, “I have always felt passionately about telling the entire story contained within Hugh Howey’s books, so I couldn’t be happier that audiences around the world have enthusiastically embraced the show. I cannot wait to dive into these final two thought-provoking seasons that will beautifully conclude this dystopian tale.” </p><p>If you’ve access to the catacombs of Apple TV+, definitely give <em>Silo</em> a watch. It’s worth noting that as of the last month, Apple’s stuff can now be accessed via Amazon Prime in the U.S. and UK, making it a far less arcane streamer to find.</p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Does such an eagerly awaited release live up to the hype? Is it full of anomalous bugs that mar the overall experience? Only the user reviews on Steam can provide such insights!</p><p>Of course, with so much strife pulling the development team in multiple directions, it would make sense that the open-world survival game felt half-baked to some, missing features to many, and downright buggy to most. That said, despite its flaws, there’s a genuinely exceptionally good time to be had in <em>Stalker 2</em>. But that’s just my opinion, and you’re here for everyone else’s!</p><p>On the positive side of the spectrum, the Steam user reviews for<em> Stalker 2</em> vary greatly, ranging from jokes and memes to declarations of undying support and love. More than a few user reviews claim this is the ultimate nostalgia trip back to childhood, while others can’t thank the team at GSC Game World enough for their work.</p><p>But it’s not all roses. On the negative review front, people claim it’s an excellent game but a terrible <em>Stalker </em>title. They point toward the lack of an A-Life system, initially announced for the game but didn’t make the cut, along with countless soft-locks, crashes, and game-breaking bugs.</p><p>Most agree that <em>Stalker 2: Heart of Chornobyl</em> required a little more time to cook, but what’s available now is surprisingly excellent despite its flaws. If you’re on the fence about the open-world survival game, then here’s your look at<em> Stalker 2</em>, as told by Steam reviews!</p><hr><figure id="" data-id="271d9e5b8fcc52dd0a79bf82d7836335"

Drawing on everything from the German Expressionist techniques of the 1922 classic <em>Nosferatu: A Symphony of Horror</em> to the grotesque transformation of Bill Skarsgård into the demented clown <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/pennywise-is-excited-about-getting-his-ass-kicked-1839988581&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/pennywise-is-excited-about-getting-his-ass-kicked-1839988581">Pennywise</a></span> in the recent <em>It </em>films, Eggers’ <em>Nosferatu</em> continues a storied horror legacy.</p><p>To fully appreciate the beauty behind the brutality of <em>Nosferatu</em> when it arrives in theaters on Christmas Day, it’s essential to familiarize yourself with its inspirations. The dreamlike visuals, the grayscale color palette that conveys a pervasive gloom, and the tight framing that creates an unsettling sense of confinement will all feel strikingly familiar if you explore these 12 must-watch films before immersing yourself in Eggers’ latest masterpiece.</p></div></div><div><p>An adaptation of the classic fairy tale, Jean Cocteau’s <em>Beauty and the Beast</em> is set in the 18th century and features a visual style that feels both sumptuous and nightmarish. The decadent costumes resemble Lily-Rose Depp’s beautiful gowns in <em>Nosferatu</em>, with plumes of silk, flowing skirts, and tight bodices. The black-and-white cinematography has a sharp, surreal quality, illuminating the piercing whites of the Beast’s eyes. The monochrome visuals are so stark they seem dreamlike—note the scene set in a pitch-black hallway lit by tiny, twinkling lights from candelabras. Like <em>Nosferatu</em>, <em>Beauty and the Beast</em> is a monster movie that is beautiful to look at, even in all its darkness.</p></div><div><p>Before seeing <em>Nosferatu</em>, you should brush up on the origins of German Expressionism, as these filmmaking techniques are still being used today. Watching Robert Wiene’s silent movie about a murderous hypnotist, you can observe the sort of visuals that continue to influence horror movies like <em>Nosferatu</em>, such as chiaroscuro lighting (heavy contrasts of light and shadow), jagged, angular buildings, and twisted, disorienting backgrounds. The scenes feel even creepier due to the older camera technology, the scratches on the film, and the eerie glow of the film stock. You can clearly see where Eggers, as well as directors like Tim Burton, draw their inspiration from.</p></div><div><p>During an appearance on Alamo Drafthouse’s YouTube series <em>Guest Selects</em>, Eggers praised Jack Clayton’s <em>The Innocents</em> as “one of the best—perhaps the best—gothic ghost movies ever made.” The film follows a governess who fears her children are possessed. Eggers mentioned that he watches the movie a couple of times a year for inspiration, and it’s evident that much of its essence will influence <em>Nosferatu</em>. Eggers was particularly inspired by Freddy Francis’ cinematography, which uses special glass filters to create a cocoon-like effect and tight framing that makes the spaces feel oppressive. In every shot, Clayton carefully positions the actors against the intricate architecture of the sprawling mansion, which dominates the scene to suggest an otherworldly presence lurking within the walls. The film is visually stunning yet deeply unsettling.</p></div><div><p>Talent and a penchant for horror clearly run in the family. Lily-Rose Depp, who stars in <em>Nosferatu</em>, follows in the footsteps of her father Johnny Depp, who was also part of a classic horror retelling: Tim Burton’s <em>Sleepy Hollow</em>, based on Washington Irving’s tale of the headless horseman. Both films are historical, set in the 18th and 19th centuries, and are filled with elaborate gowns, ripped bodices, stuffy waistcoats, and tailored trousers. They also share a grim, Gothic, grayscale color palette. Tim Burton emphasizes the vividness of red blood, making it stand out as it spills in buckets. Despite these visual similarities, the two films convey different tones: Burton’s film has a more cartoonish, whimsical vibe, while <em>Nosferatu</em> appears to be more sensuous and classical.</p></div><div><p>Gary Oldman chews the scenery as Vlad the Impaler, a warrior who loses his beloved wife to suicide, and later as the older Count Dracula, complete with a ridiculous wig resembling giant orbs. There are strong performances from Winona Ryder and Anthony Hopkins, though not so much from Keanu Reeves. Francis Ford Coppola’s <em>Dracula</em> adaptation is hypersexual and goofy in the weirdest ways—more colorful and splashy than Gothic and dark. For some, this ostentatious style suits a character who thrives on decadence and desire. With over-the-top dialogue and dramatics, combined with camerawork that whirls and twirls through Dracula’s lavish castle, it’s an epic adaptation worth watching. It even includes stylish visual homages to the original <em>Nosferatu: A Symphony of Horror</em>.</p></div><div><p><em>Nosferatu</em>’s Count Orlok is not the first terrifying character Bill Skarsgård has transformed into; he also portrayed Pennywise the Clown in the recent adaptation of Stephen King’s epic novel <em>It</em>, which follows a group of children confronting an alien entity that haunts their Maine town of Derry over several decades. As Pennywise, Skarsgård immersed himself in the role not only through grotesque prosthetics—featuring a bulbous head, buck teeth, yellow eyes, clown makeup, and a twisted smile—but also through his unsettling physicality. His movements are eerily fluid, and his voice, initially light and fluffy like cotton candy, can shift instantly to become gruff and menacing. This commitment to transforming his physicality will likely be on display again in <em>Nosferatu</em>, and watching <em>It</em> offers just a glimpse of how demonic Skarsgård can be.</p></div><div><p><em>The Lighthouse</em> is another Eggers film you should catch up on. Shot in stark black-and-white and filled with salty sea dog language, it immerses you in its claustrophobic island setting, surrounded by tantalizing mermaids and flocks of seagulls—one of which meets a violent end. In this isolated and stormy space, Willem Dafoe and Robert Pattinson’s lighthouse keepers slowly descend into madness, creating a dizzying spectacle of cursing, heavy drinking, farting, and simmering sexual tension. The ending leaves a haunting final image that lingers long after the credits roll.</p></div><div><p>Eggers made a striking debut with <em>The Witch</em> in 2015, immediately establishing himself as a distinct new filmmaker. From this film, you’ll quickly get a sense of what to expect from him: folkloric tales of darkness with a Gothic aesthetic and antiquated dialogue. <em>The Witch</em> immerses you in the mundane, rigid daily life of Puritan New England, as a family accuses their daughter of witchcraft following the disappearance of their youngest son. Eggers carefully and methodically builds the tension, uncertainty, and mistrust, culminating in a mystical and deliciously sinful finale. After watching it, you’ll never look at a goat the same way again.</p></div><div><p>Another important influence on Eggers is Bela Lugosi’s portrayal of Count Dracula in Tod Browning’s 1931 version of the tale. Lugosi’s take on the world’s most famous vampire became the quintessential archetype—mysterious and monstrous, yet debonair and hypnotic, with a regal cape, a transfixing stare, and the ability to glide through his castle like a ghost. The film exudes a Gothic elegance that is more seductive than frightening, a quality <em>Nosferatu</em> may draw upon in its own way.</p></div><div><p>Eggers told <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.empireonline.com/movies/news/robert-eggers-nosferatu-same-castle-werner-herzog-exclusive/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.empireonline.com/movies/news/robert-eggers-nosferatu-same-castle-werner-herzog-exclusive/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>Empire</em> magazine</a></span> that he has been “consciously not watching” Werner Herzog’s version of <em>Nosferatu</em>, though he did end up shooting at the same castle, Pernštejn Castle in the Czech Republic. It seems Eggers is avoiding this version because it’s another filmmaker’s interpretation of the original, and he doesn’t want to cloud his own vision. However, for us as the audience, it’s fascinating to watch and compare the original silent film, Eggers’ adaptation, and Herzog’s version. Herzog’s <em>Nosferatu</em> is highly stylized, with every frame resembling a slowly moving painting. Eschewing the shadow-drenched visuals typical of the genre, Herzog often bathes Klaus Kinski’s Count Dracula in bright light, highlighting his pale white skin and sunken eyes. Much of the terror comes not from what is hidden but from what is revealed. This approach contrasts sharply with Eggers’ darker, more somber aesthetic, offering a compelling study in how different directors can interpret the same iconic story.</p></div><div><p>There’s some meta casting in Robert Eggers’ <em>Nosferatu</em>, as Willem Dafoe, who plays Professor Albin Eberhart von Franz, also portrayed actor Max Schreck in <em>Shadow of the Vampire</em>, a fictionalized account of the making of <em>Nosferatu: A Symphony of Horror</em>. In <em>Shadow of the Vampire</em>, Max Schreck takes his role as the prowling vampire a little too seriously—so much so that he might actually be a vampire. This clever premise leads to humorous moments about method acting, with Schreck skulking around the set creepily and even eating bats, while John Malkovich’s F.W. Murnau gleefully captures it all on camera. The film builds to a chilling finale where fiction and reality blend in the most horrifying and violent ways, adding an unsettling layer to Dafoe’s connection to the <em>Nosferatu</em> legacy.</p></div><div><p>A key film to watch before Eggers’ <em>Nosferatu</em> is, of course, the 1922 original directed by F.W. Murnau, <em>Nosferatu: A Symphony of Horror</em>. In <em>Nosferatu</em>, you can see the German Expressionist techniques that have influenced countless horror films since, such as exaggerated, theatrical gestures and the use of tilted camera angles. So many images from the film remain powerful and unforgettable, from Orlok’s shadow creeping across the wall as he stalks his prey to the ravishing Ellen clutching her heart and collapsing into bed. Perhaps most striking of all is the image of Max Schreck as Count Orlok standing motionless in a hallway, his eyes bulging and his sharp claws outstretched. It’s thrilling to witness the infancy of the horror genre in <em>Nosferatu: A Symphony of Horror</em>, a silent film that, even over a century later, continues to send shivers down spines with its blend of terror and artistic innovation.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
