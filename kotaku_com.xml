            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        <p><i><span>Reanimal</span></i><span> is a beautifully rendered haunted house that lacks the scares or activities to warrant a visit. The narrative around this game has been that developer Tarsier is about to take a big swing, but I don’t see it. Not only are they playing it safe, but I think this is a diluted version of the formula they themselves established with </span><i><span>Little Nightmares I </span></i><span>and</span><i><span> II</span></i><span>.</span></p> <p><span>Developer Tarsier’s brand of horror, seen in the first two </span><i><span>Little Nightmares </span></i><span>games, has always been on the more tolerable side, with no jump scares and minimal combat. This remains true here. But historically, what the studio has excelled at is creating wonderfully horrid monster design, cartoonish body horror, and unsettling environments, combined with two key ingredients: tension and casual environmental puzzle-solving. </span><i><span>Reanimal</span></i><span> offers little of either as its brother-sister duo seek out their missing friends in an attempt to escape a treacherous island.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><span>At least the overall structure for </span><i><span>Reanimal</span></i><span> works in its favor. It involves taking your boat to different spots around the island and entering various areas to rescue your friends. This setup breaks up the pacing nicely, and it feels good to finish a mission and exit near the entrance, back at your boat. There’s just something satisfying about coming out on the other side of things, literally and metaphorically.</span></p> <figure id="attachment_2000667725" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000667725"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000667725">Tarsier Studios</figcaption></figure> <p><span>That’s mostly where the game’s strengths end, however. The de-emphasis on puzzles feels like an intentional creative choice, as there are only about a dozen throughout the game. The problem is that nothing replaces them. As an adventure game, </span><i><span>Reanimal</span></i><span> never picks a thing to excel at, nor does it diversify its gameplay enough to justify the lack of exceptionality in any single area. Its story is too vague to be worth playing for the narrative. The production values make </span><i><span>Reanimal</span></i><span> look good when glancing at screenshots and clips, but actually walking, running, and hiding in its environments feels more like trudging through a simple set than navigating a hostile world.</span></p>

 <p><span>I don’t hold my breath when I’m hiding from an enemy because they barely look for me. Nothing feels like a close call, just success or failure. I don’t feel the threats in front of me, even when they kill me. I’m not being hunted. Instead, I walk in and out of a hunting ground for short periods of time.&nbsp;</span></p> <div>           <ul>                           <li>                 <p>Back-of-the-box quote:</p>                 <p>"Seeing scares without feeling scared."</p>               </li>                                         <li>                 <p>Developer:</p>                 <p>Tarsier Studios</p>               </li>                                         <li>                 <p>Type of Game</p>                 <p>Horror adventure</p>               </li>                                         <li>                 <p>Liked:</p>                 <p>The visuals and the ending.</p>               </li>                               </ul><ul>                                         <li>                 <p>Disliked:</p>                 <p> The lack of tension and underutilized spaces.</p>               </li>                                         <li>                 <p>Platforms:</p>                 <p>PlayStation 5, Nintendo Switch 2, Xbox Series X and S, PC (played).</p>               </li>                                         <li>                 <p>Played: </p>                 <p>Rolled credits in about 6 hours.</p>               </li>                                     </ul>         </div>  <p><i><span>Reanimal</span></i><span> gives you bigger areas to explore than Tarsier’s previous games, but does nothing with all that extra space.</span> <span>Rooms are deeper, and there are wider outdoor areas to run in. You dock onto small beaches, walk through an abandoned playground, and race across an open field, to name a few. It sells you spectacle but doesn’t deliver on gameplay.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><span>In the opening hours, I wasted a lot of time running around looking for surprises, interactables, and collectibles. It wasn’t worth it. Often when I’m running through a grassy lot, going down a decrepit hallway, or checking the edges of a room, it turns out to be for nothing. And when I am rewarded, it feels more like a happenstance than a discovery because for every time my instincts were right, there were many more times they were wrong. And as much as I love the cosmetic masks you can find if you poke around, it just wasn’t worth it after a certain point. It’s worth noting, though, that there’s also concept art to find, statues to light, coffins to find, and numerous other secrets to discover. They just weren’t worth pursuing to me.&nbsp;</span></p> <figure id="attachment_2000667721" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000667721"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000667721">Tarsier Studios</figcaption></figure> <p><span>I beat </span><i><span>Reanimal</span></i><span> solo but played the first two of its nine chapters again in local co-op (online co-op is also an option). The extra set of eyes helped me find two things I’d missed the first time, but neither of us felt accomplished with our discoveries. In </span><i><span>Reanimal</span></i><span>, you’re not rewarded for your observation skills; you’re rewarded for your ability to run your hands over the walls.</span></p>

 <p><span>The real thing to do in </span><i><span>Reanimal</span></i><span> is to keep going. There’s little friction and even less intrigue because you’re not asked to do much.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>Many of the spaces in </span><i><span>Reanimal</span></i><span> feel less like the products of a dying or disturbed society and more like an underfurnished apartment. The first town I went to was particularly guilty of this.&nbsp;</span></p>  <p><span>You enter a room with a few long tables in the center and a couple of knocked-over bookshelves against the walls. Your first time here, you just walk through it. The second time, a tall, lanky enemy with contortionist movement and a fedora appears. He’s the first major enemy in </span><i><span>Reanimal</span></i><span> and is known as Sniffer.</span></p> <p><span>He crawls out of a body that’s seated at the head of the table, and since he was on top of it, I ran under the table. Nearby, there’s a door with a few wooden planks attached to it. The first time, I tried to escape while he was glancing under the table, but he caught me. It was then that I realized all I had to do was wait for a few seconds. He looks under the table twice, and then he stands up and ponders for a full 30 seconds before leaving the room completely. With Sniffer gone, removing the planks was just a matter of interacting with them, then waiting for the animation to finish.</span></p>

 <figure id="attachment_2000667723" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000667723"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000667723">Tarsier Studios</figcaption></figure> <p><span>Moments like this demonstrate the ways in which </span><i><span>Reanimal </span></i><span>leaves tension on the table. You’re rarely asked to do anything during these escapes besides run, hide, or wait. You aren’t sneakily accomplishing something while a monster’s back is turned, outside of a few cart pushes.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>Tarsier could have gotten away with largely abandoning environmental puzzle-solving if finding or getting to the hiding spots were more challenging. </span><i><span>Reanimal</span></i><span>’s larger layouts also led the studio to largely do away with the verticality that helped make some of </span><i><span>Little Nightmares</span></i><span>’ chase sequences so memorable. Tarsier abandons old ideas without picking up any new ones. The result is a really limited experience.</span></p>

 <p><i><span>Reanimal</span></i><span> feels like a weak Disney theme park ride; you appreciate the artistry that went into the spectacle, but it’s not particularly fun.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>One of the most disappointing enemy encounters I experienced occurred when I entered a laundromat where I could spot Sniffer ironing human skins, surrounded by piles of rags, bodies, and a few rows of washing machines. The solution was to hide in the machines while he looked around, and then run when given the opportunity, opening a vent on the other side of the room to head to the next area. Upon reaching the second room, which contains rows of tubs, hanging bodies, and two washers in the corner, the solution was to avoid rather than evade. Sniffer enters the room and, after getting caught by him a few times, I went back to the first room. Sniffer never followed me there, and when I returned to the second room, he had opened the door to the third room. The whole section was quite literally just a lot of back and forth.&nbsp;</span></p> <figure id="attachment_2000667724" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000667724"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000667724">Tarsier Studios</figcaption></figure> <p><span>A similarly odd design decision reveals itself when Sniffer rides a tricycle towards me, and I flee. After a few feet, his hands reach out to grab me, but they miss, and I escape. I then go back immediately to find that only his tricycle remains. I still don’t know what the point of that sequence was. It wasn’t scary, and it would’ve been threatening if he committed to tormenting me, but he didn’t. So much of Sniffer’s behavior makes it feel like he’s a scare actor in a haunted house who really needs to get to his next mark because they’re short-staffed.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><span>Good horror is as much about what isn’t there as what is. It’s the anticipation. It’s the shadow or the screech that turns out to be nothing. It’s the way your senses can get fooled. It’s the fear that you can’t trust your own perception. And just when you’re sweating over it all, the monster appears—or worse, you never even see it coming. </span><i><span>Reanimal</span></i><span>’s approach to horror is much more straightforward, to its detriment.</span></p>  <p><span>Many of </span><i><span>Reanimal</span></i><span>’s setups are predictable, and my ability to see a threat coming makes it less impactful when it arrives. One of the earliest examples occurred when I had to grab a wheel at the end of a shelf-lined hallway. On those shelves were boxes, many of which had human skin suits draped over them. It was obvious that the second I grabbed the wheel the skins would attack me, and they did.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>Even when </span><i><span>Reanimal </span></i><span>does manage to surprise, it fails to capitalize on it. For instance, in town there’s a movie playing at the theater. The second time you see the movie, the silhouette of Sniffer appears behind the screen. But that doesn’t amount to anything, and a few moments later you see him on the aforementioned tricycle.&nbsp;</span></p> <figure id="attachment_2000667722" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000667722"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000667722">Tarsier Studios</figcaption></figure> <p><span>Another such disappointment occurred whenever the game made use of striking visuals, but failed to make the most of them. </span><i><span>Reanimal</span></i><span> draws on a dark color palette, leaning on blue, grey, and brown to create a dreary atmosphere. But at one point, I reached the top of a long ladder and saw a huge, vibrant, densely packed field of orange flowers. I ran toward the unknown as the figure in the background slowly came into focus the closer I got. There was real potential in that uncertainty, but it turned out it was just a barn with a simple rescue mission that took a few minutes. A beautiful setup that amounted to very little.</span></p>

 <p><span>The game’s design also discourages exploration by failing to visually differentiate between what’s on the critical path and what’s optional. Too often it’s a matter of picking between two doors. In these instances, I found myself opening each door, assessing each room, then taking a guess as to which was optional. These steps don’t take too long, but given the long animations they’re a pain to repeat. This, combined with the generally unrewarding open spaces, discouraged me from exploring once I got halfway through the game.</span></p> <p><span>Early on, </span><i><span>Reanimal</span></i><span> introduces some basic combat mechanics like the ability to swing at sandy humanoid enemies and throw weapons back at bosses, but even that is just welcome busywork to offset a boring experience.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><span>The highlight of </span><i><span>Reanimal</span></i><span> is its final hour</span><i><span>,</span></i><span> which includes sequences that differentiate themselves from the rest of the game by putting you in the position of being both the hunter and the hunted. And the conclusion helps give some meaning to the repeated images you see throughout the adventure that hint at its larger story.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>If anything, this bright spot only highlighted my disappointment with the game even more because I know Tarsier can make a good game. Unfortunately, a handful of highs and a nice ending don’t redeem the hours I spent meandering from place to place, unmotivated and unamused.</span></p>      </div></div><br/><br/>https://kotaku.com/reanimal-review-little-nightmares-3-horror-adventure-2000667716]]></content:encoded>

              <p>PC parts, <a href="https://kotaku.com/target-employee-shows-pc-game-memory-part-price-increases-shortage-ram-ssd-2000663863">in particular memory, have skyrocketed in price over the last few months</a>, thanks largely to AI companies rushing to build massive datacenters. But at least a few people are skipping the store and diving into their local garbage dump to find PC parts, including one person who found a few hundred dollars’ worth of RAM in the trash.</p> <p><a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/hardware/memory/redditor-scores-usd500-worth-of-ddr4-at-local-dump-and-now-im-wondering-if-every-landfill-is-actually-a-goldmine/">As spotted by <em>PC Gamer</em>,</a> Reddit user <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/pcmasterrace/comments/1qznbxp/major_score_at_the_dump_today/">Ringosbigfuckingnose (lol) shared a few images</a> of their most recent haul after scavenging through their local dump. They claim to have found 64 GB of DDR4 RAM, worth an estimated $500 if bought new. Pretty damn good considering all they had to do was scrounge through some junk. The user also says they found a 10th Gen Intel i7 CPU and a solid Asus motherboard.</p>

   <p>“I check my local dump pretty regularly for older (486/early Pentium era) hardware, but every now and again ill find a busted up [all-in-one] desktop I can get a bit of DDR4 to upgrade my laptop with or something like that,” said Ringosbigfuckingnose. The user said the new PC parts will provide a “major upgrade” to their current RIG.</p> <p>In the replies, other Reddit users started sharing stories of PC parts and computer junk they had found in the dump, and if this sounds too hard to believe, well, I’ll throw this in: Last year, I found a full gaming PC tossed into a shared dumpster. It contained a 3060ti GPU and 32GB of RAM, plus an ugly neon case and some other parts that barely looked touched. Was quite a score. Of course, please be careful if you decide to go dumpster diving for PC parts. Laws vary from place to place, not all dumps are open to the public, and jumping into a private dumpster on someone else’s property is a big no-no. So don’t do that.</p>

 <p>As to why people are even resorting to checking the dump for PC parts, things are getting bad out there. <a href="https://kotaku.com/nvidia-rtx-3060-returning-2026-dram-shortage-gpus-expensive-prices-2000656687">Over the last few months,</a>&nbsp;<a href="https://kotaku.com/the-10-biggest-gaming-disappointments-worst-news-game-key-cards-gta-6-delay-2000655356#:~:text=Playing%20Video%20Games%20Is%20Becoming%20A%20Very%20Expensive%20Hobby">PC gaming and memory have become more expensive</a>. This is largely thanks to AI hyperscalers and&nbsp;<a href="https://kotaku.com/asus-rog-ally-price-increase-nvidia-amd-ai-ps6-delay-2000656448">tech giants gobbling up PC parts to build datacenters</a>; it’s becoming&nbsp;<a href="https://kotaku.com/amd-gpu-prices-radeon-ps5-xbox-steam-machine-2000645803">quite pricey and challenging</a>&nbsp;for your average person to buy PC RAM, graphics cards, or even an SSD for a console. Even the prices on prebuilt PCs from companies like HP, Dell, and Asus will increase by 15 to 20 percent,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/3021660/computer-prices-could-go-up-by-20-due-to-ram-shortage-pc-makers-warn.html">according to&nbsp;<em>PC World.</em></a>&nbsp;It’s very likely that this will start&nbsp;<a href="https://kotaku.com/switch-2-price-increase-nintendo-ram-shortage-2000658946">causing problems for console makers, too.</a> So if you see gamers roving your local dump, now you know why.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[8 Things We Just Learned About The Animal Crossing-Like Pokémon Pokopia]]></title>
            <link>https://kotaku.com/pokemon-pokopia-ditto-viva-pinata-snap-how-long-to-beat-2000667732</link>
            <guid>1432420</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><i><span>Pokémon</span></i><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-pokopia-release-date-switch-2-multiplayer-ditto-2000660646"><i><span> Pokopia</span></i></a> <span>is a few weeks away, and a bunch of outlets who got some hands-on time with the game just published previews of the Switch 2 life sim and town builder. A lot of what folks got to play lines up with stuff we already know, but there are also a few new details that round out our understanding of the game’s town management and make its setting sound like a pretty sizable, living world. Here’s a few things we noticed.</span></p> <h2><b>The game seems kinda gross (complimentary)</b></h2> <p><span>In </span><i><span>Pokopia</span></i><span>, you play as a Ditto who transforms into a human and is able to help various other Pokémon around a town you’re all working to rebuild. Because of Ditto’s malleable form, it’s able to change its body to use certain attacks that can help you build structures, break down materials, and perform other handy actions. But it also sounds like Ditto keeps its inventory inside its body, which means it’s constantly puking up items to help build the town and shifting its body in ways that would be horrifying if the game weren’t so cute.</span></p>

 <p><span>“</span><i><span>Pokopia </span></i><span>is a masterclass in physical comedy,” Jesse Vitelli writes on </span><a href="https://www.restart.run/articles/pokemon-pokopia-preview-hands-on"><i><span>Restart</span></i></a><span>. “It’s in the way your character animates when using moves like Water Gun, which have Ditto recoiling as the water spits from its mouth, or growing large, vine-like hands to pick up plants. Your Ditto is expressive but cold at the same time, making it feel like a member of a Vaudeville act. Using Ditto’s inhuman abilities to present physical comedy gags helps </span><i><span>Pokopia’</span></i><span>s personality shine through. Your inventory, for example, is held within Ditto’s body. Extracting anything causes them to regurgitate it onto the field, like some sort of gelatinous cube bag of holding.”</span></p> <h2><b>There’s a bit of </b><b><i>Viva Piñata</i></b><b> in this game</b></h2> <p><i><span>Animal Crossing </span></i><span>and </span><i><span>Dragon Quest Builders </span></i><span>have been easy points of reference when talking about </span><i><span>Pokopia</span></i><span>, but based on what folks have played, it sounds like the game will also have shades of Rare’s cult classic life sim </span><i><span>Viva Piñata</span></i><span>. In that game, you had to curate your garden so its wild animals would be attracted to the space and want to live there. That seems to be how you’ll get Pokémon to come live in your town in </span><i><span>Pokopia</span></i><span>, too.</span></p>

 <p><span>“What surprised me most, though, was the way it reminded me of one of my favorites, the cult classic </span><i><span>Viva Piñata</span></i><span>,” says Steve Watts at </span><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/pokemon-pokopia-borrows-pieces-of-animal-crossing-minecraft-and-viva-pinata/1100-6538062/"><i><span>GameSpot</span></i></a><span>. That’s because the core mission at the heart of </span><i><span>Pokémon Pokopia</span></i><span> is building new habitats that will attract the attention of particular Pokémon, similar to tending to your garden in </span><i><span>Viva Piñata.</span></i><span> In the early game, at least, these tended to involve arranging a small set of elements in a particular order. Tall grass near the water will attract a Squirtle, while building a campfire will bring around a Charmander. When you’ve fulfilled the right conditions, you’ll see a rustling in the grass and then go meet your new Pokémon pal. From then on, they’ll live in your community, and you can build more structures like a bed to make their stay more comfortable.”</span></p>

 <h2><b>We might be rebuilding humanity’s world, as well</b></h2> <p><span>A dark cloud has hung over </span><i><span>Pokopia </span></i><span>since it was first announced, in that it seems like the game </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-pokopia-post-apocalypse-snorlax-pikachu-fuschia-2000644400"><span>may take place in a post-apocalyptic world</span></a><span> where humanity has disappeared. This is shown in how characters like Professor Tangrowth mention having not seen humans walking around in a long time, and in that a lot of the environments we’ll be fixing up for Pokémon to live in are made up of dilapidated human structures like a Pokémon Center. According to the previews, we’ll be rebuilding these as well, and they’ll act as a hub for assignments and tasks.</span></p>  <h2><b>There’s some </b><b><i>Pokémon Snap </i></b><b>vibes</b></h2> <p><span>We’ve already seen that Ditto will have a camera to take selfies and photos, but it sounds like </span><i><span>Pokopia </span></i><span>is actually game-ifying this to some extent. Fans of the photography game </span><i><span>Pokémon Snap</span></i><span> will be delighted to know that </span><i><span>Pokopia </span></i><span>has photo ops that give you in-game rewards for stumbling upon them in the world.</span></p>

 <p><span>“While wandering the Pokémon suburbs, I was alerted that there was a Pokémon photo opportunity nearby,” Watts writes. “I didn’t even know that photography was a mechanic at this point, but I followed the waypoint into one of the houses to find an Audino singing happily while taking a shower. I brought up the camera and snapped a picture, and was rewarded with a message telling me that I successfully captured the photo op. The game had guided me into a strange moment of wholesome Pokémon voyeurism.”</span></p> <h2><b>The soundtrack has some old favorites</b></h2> <p><span>The </span><i><span>Pokémon </span></i><span>series has a lot of recognizable tracks from over the course of its 30 years, and it sounds like </span><i><span>Pokopia </span></i><span>is pulling from all that history in its soundtrack, with a lot of the game’s </span><i><span>Pokémon </span></i><span>personality and vibes come through in the sound design.</span></p> <p><span>“Aside from the foreshadowed desolation, what struck me most about </span><i><span>Pokopia </span></i><span>was how relaxing its interpolations of classic </span><i><span>Pokémon </span></i><span>songs were and how expressive the game’s monster animations are,” Charles Pulliam-Moore wrote at </span><a href="https://www.theverge.com/games/876285/pokemon-pokopia-hands-on-preview"><i><span>The Verge</span></i></a><span>. “Though the game isn’t voice acted, Pokémon’s faces charmingly convey the emotions they’re feeling — sometimes they’re excited to talk to you, sometimes they’re in a bad mood and need cheering up — as you visit them in their new homes.”</span></p>

 <h2><b>Ditto’s story sounds pretty fucking sad</b></h2> <p><span>While the core premise of a </span><i><span>Pokémon </span></i><span>world without humans is sad enough, it sounds like our transforming hero will have their own heartbreaking backstory. According to previews, the human form Ditto takes is meant to be a facsimile of their long-lost trainer who Ditto has been separated from. With no idea what happened to them, Ditto will try to use this form to ask their fellow ‘mons for information.</span></p> <p><span>“No one else knows what Ditto’s trainer looks like, so Ditto transforming into the trainer it misses is essentially asking the other Pokémon, “Do you know this human being?” Again, so cute, so melancholic, and I love it,”&nbsp; Casey Defreitas says at </span><a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/pokemon-pokopia-the-final-preview"><i><span>IGN</span></i></a><span>.</span></p>

 <h2><b>It will take anywhere from 20-40 hours to hit credits</b></h2> <p><span>Like most life sims, </span><i><span>Pokémon Pokopia </span></i><span>will have a lot to do beyond its main story, but if you’re just trying to hit credits, it will take anywhere from 20-40 hours to reach them.</span></p> <p><span>“The main motivation for this game is typically not to go to the end roll [credits],” chief director Takuto Edagawa told </span><a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/pokemon-pokopia-will-take-20-40-hours-to-beat-on-average-and-theres-more-after-the-credits-says-director"><i><span>IGN</span></i></a><span>. “The whole concept is to create the world with Pokémon and live with the Pokémon. However, as an average, it’ll be about 20 to 40 hours, but it would really depend on how the players play the game. There’s more things to experience after the end roll [credits]. So it depends on what you mean by contents, but I believe that players are encouraged to and will be motivated to continue to play the game.”</span></p> <h2><b>There will be periodic events to keep people coming back</b></h2> <p><span>Part of this “motivation” to keep playing is that </span><i><span>Pokopia </span></i><span>will have some events that take place on specific days, which might have people coming back even after they’ve seen the main story through, according to </span><i><span>IGN</span></i><span>’s preview.</span></p>

 <p><span>There will also be motivation for players to log in intermittently. </span><i><span>Pokémon Pokopia</span></i><span> Producer Kanako Murata of The Pokémon Company said “When you play day-by-day, there may be something that, on a specific day, something special that might happen in the game.</span></p> <p><span>There’s still a fair bit of mystery around </span><i><span>Pokopia</span></i><span>, especially in regards to its potentially dark setting, but we won’t have to wait too much longer to uncover its secrets, as the game is coming to Switch 2 on March 5.</span></p>
