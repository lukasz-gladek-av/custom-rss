A24 announced <em>Elden Ring </em>is the latest hit game slated to get a live-action adaptation, with Ex Machina and <em>Civil War</em>’s Alex Garland signed on to direct. What exactly the result will be is anyone’s guess, and fans aren’t quite sure whether to praise the sun or get ready for a flop.</p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="195502" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="The Most Sought After Elden Ring Sword Has A Storied History" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="307" data-playlist="195502,195624,196773" data-current="195502"><div><p>The Most Sought After Elden Ring Sword Has A Storied History</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195502/195502_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195502/195502_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195502/195502_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195502/195502_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/20979.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>The brutal but massively acclaimed 2022 action-RPG has sold over 30 million copies, making it a straightforward choice for Hollywood to take a shot at in terms of the financial upside. But while some game movies have recently hit big at the box office, like <em>Sonic</em>, <em>Mario</em>, and <em>Minecraft</em>, others aimed at more mature audiences—like <em>Borderlands</em>—have been epic failures. </p><p>The <em>Elden Ring</em> project doesn’t have a tentative release date yet and about the only other thing we know so far is that the production team includes some combination of: Peter Rice, Andrew Macdonald, Allon Reich, Vince Gerardis, and George R. R. Martin. That last name is important not just because he’s the author behind the <em>Game of Thrones</em>, but also because he collaborated with FromSoftware on <em>Elden Ring</em>’s story and world building. </p><p>Precisely how much he was involved remains up for debate. Martin seems happy to involve himself in any creative endeavor that will delay him from finally finishing the last two books in his<em> Song of Fire and Ice</em> fantasy series, <em>The Winds of Winter </em>and <em>A Dream of Spring</em>. <em>Elden Ring</em> fans, a famously chill bunch, aren’t sure how to feel about the whole thing. </p><p>Garland has been on a writing and directing blitz. Following his acclaimed sci-fi horror <em>Ex Machina</em> and his adaptation of the <em>Annihilation</em> books, he’s recently put out the American political horror flick <em>Civil War</em>, this year’s Iraq invasion movie <em>Warfare</em>, and a bunch of <em>28 Days Later </em>spin-offs. How would his horror chops influence <em>Elden Ring </em>on the big screen? </p><p>Given it’s an A24 production, there’s a good chance Garland and company will have a lot of latitude with the mood of an <em>Elden Ring</em> movie and how it’s shot, with more artistic license than a conventional game adaptation aimed at a mass audience might be offered. And of course there’s whatever role publisher Bandai Namco will play in all of this, as well as FromSoftware itself. Director Hidetaka Miyazaki has been integral to the studio’s unique brand of storytelling, including <em>Elden Ring</em>, but has no confirmed role in the adaptation at the moment.</p><p>You should actually watch an interview <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iJUab499PVA&amp;pp=0gcJCdgAo7VqN5tD&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iJUab499PVA&amp;pp=0gcJCdgAo7VqN5tD" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Garland did with Naughty Dog’s Neil Druckmann</a></span> if you want to get a good sense of how he thinks about storytelling in games and movies. I can imagine a very stoic, near wordless script that focuses an <em>Elden Ring</em> movie primarily on the mythology and horror of The Lands Between, which is in some ways comparable to zombie Camelot. </p><p> FromSoftware’s boss creature designs, extravagant and larger-than-life, seem like a challenging fit for a live-action production without a Disney-level budget for special effects. Then again, the team on <em>Godzilla Minus One</em> proved you don’t need tons of money to make an incredible-looking monster movie. I wonder if Guillermo del Toro was offered a shot at <em>Elden Ring</em> and passed. It certainly seems more up his alley than Garland’s. </p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Joel (Pedro Pascal) and Ellie (Bella Ramsey) are standing on a hill with the Jackson settlement they’ll call home in the distance. Ellie, unconvinced by Joel’s story about raiders massacring the Firefly revolutionaries who were looking to make a cure for the cordyceps fungus, asks the smuggler to swear that everything he said is true. Joel hesitates and then says that he swears. However, rather than keeping the now-iconic hard cut to black on Ellie’s skeptical face as she says “okay,” season two shows her walking down the hill and leaving Joel in an uncomfortable silence. This unnecessary addition to a scene that was once perfect is a pretty concise encapsulation of the season’s biggest problems. But it’s hardly the most egregious example in this episode.</p></blockquote><p><strong>Read more: </strong><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/last-of-us-hbo-max-season-2-episode-1-recap-review-s2e1-1851775994&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/last-of-us-hbo-max-season-2-episode-1-recap-review-s2e1-1851775994"><em>The Last Of Us</em> Season Two, Episode One Recap: Everybody Hates Joel</a></span></p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="526b76c549bc47afd349ae47beb8810d" data-recommend-id="image://526b76c549bc47afd349ae47beb8810d" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Joel raises his hands while looking at something off-screen." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Joel raises his hands while looking at something off-screen." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->HBO</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="526b76c549bc47afd349ae47beb8810d" data-recommend-id="image://526b76c549bc47afd349ae47beb8810d" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Joel raises his hands while looking at something off-screen." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><blockquote data-type="BlockQuote"><p>Welcome back to another recap of <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/last-of-us-season-2-hbo-max-show-review-joel-ellie-abby-1851774661?_gl=1*1u3tm7o*_ga*MTU0OTQ4NzYzMi4xNjcwODY1MjIy*_ga_V4QNJTT5L0*czE3NDgwMDcyNTYkbzk0JGcxJHQxNzQ4MDA3NjIxJGo1NyRsMCRoMCRkaTEwRWRDMnVEUktfZ0tnQ1QyVW5aNnFubXp0OG5sdTZDUQ..&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/last-of-us-season-2-hbo-max-show-review-joel-ellie-abby-1851774661?_gl=1*1u3tm7o*_ga*MTU0OTQ4NzYzMi4xNjcwODY1MjIy*_ga_V4QNJTT5L0*czE3NDgwMDcyNTYkbzk0JGcxJHQxNzQ4MDA3NjIxJGo1NyRsMCRoMCRkaTEwRWRDMnVEUktfZ0tnQ1QyVW5aNnFubXp0OG5sdTZDUQ.."><em>The Last of Us</em> season two</a></span>.

However, I don’t think I have it in me this week. I’ve been dreading writing a recap for the sixth episode of this season because it is exactly the kind of sentimental, dramatic episode of television that often captivates audiences and gets award show buzz, but it is also one of the most nauseating adaptations of the original work the show has given us yet. This is where all of showrunner Craig Mazin’s odd creative choices collide like the gnarliest 10-car pileup you’ve ever witnessed, and the result is the absolute bastardization of the most important scene in all of <em>The Last of Us Part II</em>.</p></blockquote><p><strong>Read more: </strong><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/last-of-us-season-2-episode-6-recap-museum-porch-scene-1851781187&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/last-of-us-season-2-episode-6-recap-museum-porch-scene-1851781187"><em>The Last Of Us</em> Season Two, Episode Six Recap: Days Of You And Me</a></span></p></div></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

There are ruins across the water, a small abandoned dock down the hill, and behind you, an entire city. But where do you go, what do you do, and why should you care about delivering a necklace of all things? There’s a lot the game doesn’t tell you, and we aim to fix that.</p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="196742" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="What Is Dragonsplague?

Enemy level scaling is an age-old issue that folks complained about back in the Xbox 360 days, and yes, it’s still problematic in <em>Oblivion Remastered</em>. Every enemy you face scales alongside you, so they’ll grow in power as you level up. It makes for a challenging RPG, to say the least. Thankfully, this version of the game altered how leveling works slightly, so you can place points into three Attributes each time you gain a rank.</p><p>To avoid becoming overwhelmed, don’t opt for an entirely passive playthrough, though. It won’t work well to just avoid fights. Instead, mix and match your skills by, say, choosing Mercantile <em>and </em>Blade. After all, anyone traveling the roads of Cyrodiil could benefit from a hidden knife.</p><h2 id="h108319"><a id="2"></a>Stealing is lucrative, so long as you can find a fence</h2><figure id="" data-id="5afe24d11d6123366e28487a85e84896" data-recommend-id="image://5afe24d11d6123366e28487a85e84896" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Ongar the fence of Bruma in Oblivion Remastered" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Ongar the fence of Bruma in Oblivion Remastered" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Bethesda / Brandon Morgan / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="5afe24d11d6123366e28487a85e84896" data-recommend-id="image://5afe24d11d6123366e28487a85e84896" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Ongar the fence of Bruma in Oblivion Remastered" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>If you’re playing a stealth-focused character, specifically a thief making a living robbing everyone in sight, you’ll soon learn that selling stolen goods proves problematic in Cyrodiil. Every stolen item is marked with a red hand, meaning it’s illicit goods, and no merchant worth their weight in gold will touch said items. You need a fence!</p><p>You won’t find a fence out in the wild, not easily. Instead, join the Thieves’ Guild to unlock Ongar the World-Weary, a fence in Bruma, who will buy stolen items. It’s the earliest and easiest fence unlock in the game.</p><h2 id="h108320"><a id="3"></a>The main story is an easy way to level up (it’ll also cause Oblivion gates to spawn)</h2><figure id="" data-id="28ac296efc011f17bd2ba4ccbf97f232" data-recommend-id="image://28ac296efc011f17bd2ba4ccbf97f232" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="An Oblivion Gate in Oblivion Remastered" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="An Oblivion Gate in Oblivion Remastered" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Bethesda / Brandon Morgan / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="28ac296efc011f17bd2ba4ccbf97f232" data-recommend-id="image://28ac296efc011f17bd2ba4ccbf97f232" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="An Oblivion Gate in Oblivion Remastered" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Yes, the entire prologue is the game’s way of introducing you to the overarching story, of the fates and of political intrigue, and Daedric portals wiping clean the land. But once you exit the sewer, it’s quickly forgotten in favor of the expansive open world.</p><p>It may be tempting, but don’t ignore the main quest (unless you want to delay when Oblivion gates spawn)! </p><p>Follow the main quest and take back Castle Kvatch, in which you’ll pass through an Oblivion Gate and enter the Daedric Realm. <strong>Once you complete this task, Oblivion Gates will open across the land, outside of each major city, and where you least expect them to: Out in the wild</strong>. They’re easy loot and leveling opportunities, especially if you’re playing a combat-oriented class!</p><hr><p><em>Oblivion Remastered</em> is available now on PS5, Xbox Series X/S, Windows PCs, and Game Pass.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
