              <p>America’s most fashionable and fantastic pig, <a href="https://kotaku.com/the-muppets-were-always-adult-1724411134">Miss Piggy</a>, is finally getting what she has long deserved: Her very own feature film. It only took those in charge of <em>The Muppets</em> five decades.</p> <p><a href="https://deadline.com/2025/11/miss-piggy-movie-cole-escola-jennifer-lawrence-emma-stone-1236607843/">As spotted by <em>Deadline</em></a>, Jennifer Lawrence recently spilled the beans on a Miss Piggy movie that she and Emma Stone are producing and developing. The news was shared during an interview on Bowen Yang and Matt Rogers’ <em>Las Culturistas </em>podcast<em>.&nbsp;</em></p> <p>“I don’t know if I can announce this, but I’m just going to. Emma Stone and I are producing a Miss Piggy movie, and [Cole Escola] is writing it,” said <em>X-Men</em> and <em>Hunger Games</em> star Lawrence. The actor didn’t reveal any plot details during the interview, but when asked if she and Stone would appear in the film replied: “I think so, we have to.” Comedian and writer <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cole_Escola">Escola</a> has become a big sensation following the release of their hit Broadway play <em>Oh, Mary!&nbsp;</em></p>

 <p>Disney and The Jim Henson Company have yet to officially announce the <em>Muppets</em> spin-off movie starring Miss Piggy.</p> <p>If the movie actually happens, it would mark the character’s first solo outing since the famous pig debuted on <em>The Muppet Show</em> back in 1976. The Muppets franchise recently celebrated its 70-year anniversary. And in September, it was announced that Seth Rogen was leading the charge on a new <em>Muppet Show</em> reboot.</p> <p><a href="https://deadline.com/2025/09/the-muppet-show-disney-plus-seth-rogen-sabrina-carpenter-pilot-1236546510/">Meanwhile, <em>Deadline</em> reports</a> that Disney is working on a Sabrina Carpenter-led <em>Muppets</em> special that is set to air in 2026, just in time for the 50th anniversary of the original TV show.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/assassins-creed-shadows-sales-ubisoft-politics-culture-war-2000641428</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/report-ubisoft-details-its-battle-to-overcome-assassin%E2%80%99s-creed-shadows-%E2%80%98haters%E2%80%99.1344949/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Last year, <em>Assassin’s Creed Shadows</em> became a target for right-wing culture warriors ranging from <a href="https://kotaku.com/assassins-creed-shadows-woke-stop-killing-games-1851786587">random shareholders</a> <a href="https://kotaku.com/assassins-creed-shadows-yasuke-backlash-racist-elon-1851539007">to Elon Musk</a>. In a recent video shown at Paris Games Week, Ubisoft reportedly tried to take back ownership of the narrative surrounding the attacks and demonstrate a potential playbook for dealing with haters online. How much of it is just spin remains to be seen, but it’s an unusual move for a company that usually shrinks from controversy.</p> <p>The video’s existence <a href="https://www.gamefile.news/p/paris-video-assassins-creed-shadows">was reported by <em>Game File</em></a>, including a partial transcription of what it said and additional comments from CEO Yves Guillemot after it was shown to gaming industry members during an event at the conference. The brief presentation detailed the company’s version of events, positioning the game’s unexpected delay last year as a bold move.</p>

 <p>Instead of shying away from criticisms lobbed from certain corners of the internet that Ubisoft was “virtue signaling” by featuring the story of African samurai Yasuke, it doubled down on polishing the game and highlighting the elements that made it<em> Assassin’s Creed</em>. So the theory goes, anyway.</p>

 <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">Ubisoft has stopped sharing sales data with Circana who reports the software &amp; hardware sales in the us.</p> <p>First image the top selling games of 2025 as of June including AC Shadows, second image top selling games of 2025 as of July without Shadows.</p> <p>Mat from Circana confirmed this <a href="https://t.co/4WuKoSgRhP">pic.twitter.com/4WuKoSgRhP</a></p> <p>— JorRaptor (@Jorraptor) <a href="https://twitter.com/Jorraptor/status/1960794645308252467?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">August 27, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <p>“With our allies beside us, we found confidence again: To stand tall, to take risks, to speak up, even against the loudest haters,” the narrator of the marketing video says, according to <em>Game File</em>. “And by the time<em> Assassin’s Creed Shadows</em> launched, thanks to our fans, momentum was finally on our side.”</p>

 <p>Guillemot elaborated on the pivot in a conversation afterwards. “We were initially surprised by the extent of the attacks,” he said, according to <a href="https://www.gamefile.news/p/paris-video-assassins-creed-shadows"><em>Game File</em>‘s translation</a>. “And we quickly realized that it was a battle, a battle with our fans, to demonstrate that we were, in fact, more of a video game than a message.”</p>

 <h2><em>Assassin’s Creed Shadows</em>‘ sales figures are in stealth mode</h2> <p>It’s an echo of something the cofounder said shortly after announcing the game’s delay. “I want to reaffirm that we are an entertainment-first company, creating games for the broadest possible audience, and our goal is not to push any specific agenda,” he told investors last year in an apparent attempt to beat the allegations of the company’s worst critics. <a href="https://kotaku.com/assassins-creed-game-cancel-reconstruction-black-slave-2000633318"><em>Game File</em> also reported</a> that the company canceled an <em>Assassin’s Creed</em> set in post-Civil War America over concerns about political unrest.</p>

 <p>Ubisoft did hit back at critics earlier this year. The official <em>Assassin’s Creed</em> account <a href="https://x.com/assassinscreed/status/1897048261619540235">dunked on one of the most high-profile social media accounts</a> leading a campaign against the game. But developers working on the game were <a href="https://kotaku.com/assassins-creed-shadows-antiwoke-ubisoft-rpg-1851770511">reportedly also advised</a> not to post about <em>Assassin’s Creed Shadows</em>‘ release to avoid becoming a target of the harassment campaign.</p> <p>How has this all worked out for Ubisoft? It’s hard to tell. <em>Shadows</em> was well reviewed at launch and sold well in its first few months. It was the third top-grossing game in the U.S. as of June, but Ubisoft has stopped sharing public sales data in the months since and hasn’t officially confirmed <a href="https://twitter.com/Jorraptor/status/1960794645308252467?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1960794645308252467%7Ctwgr%5Edbaadbf897184f93beb9cf56c0dee354ed10b92a%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fkotaku.com%2Fwp%2Fwp-admin%2Fpost-new.php">exact sales figures</a>. It must have been happy enough with the results to move ahead with other delays. Ubisoft told investors earlier this year that a slate of unannounced upcoming blockbusters <a href="https://kotaku.com/far-cry-7-assassins-creed-hexe-ghost-recon-delay-1851780674">would take longer than expected to ship</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><em>Dicey Dungeons</em> came out <a href="https://kotaku.com/dicey-dungeons-is-a-good-entry-point-for-deck-builders-1837283279">way back in 2019</a>, a fact that blew my mind when I went to go double-check it today. That feels like a lifetime ago, but the deckbuilding roguelike itself still feels surprisingly fresh. Developed by Terry Cavanagh (<em>Super Hexagon</em>, <em>VVVVVV</em>), it combines two of my favorite things, turn-based combat and getting burned on RNG re-rolls, into a great dice battling game that too often goes overlooked. Somehow it’s currently just $3 on Switch.</p> <p>The premise is basically “what if you took a traditional turn-based dungeon game and ran every action through a jumble of chaos?” You collect equipment in the form of cards which dictate what actions you can take, and dice which are used to activate the cards. Some cards can only work with certain dice, and certain abilities will be stronger or weaker depending on the rolls you link them with. It’s a multi-layered math problem that sounds like homework in theory but is actually quite straightforward to navigate and slickly implemented in practice.</p>

 <p>There’s a bit of <em>Slay the Spire</em>, a bit of <em>Balatro</em>, and a whole lot of Cavanagh’s own clever design work going on. It’s not the only great Switch indie game on sale right now, though. A whole bunch of them are super cheap for the next week or so:</p> <ul> <li><em>Sifu</em> – $10 (75 percent off)</li> <li><em>What Remains of Edith Finch</em> – $4 (80 percent off)</li> <li><em>The Pathless</em> – $10 (75 percent off)</li> <li><em>Haiku, the Robot</em> – $4 (80 percent off)</li> <li><em>Ashen</em> – $10 (75 percent off)</li> <li><em>Dredge</em> – $10 (60 percent off)</li> <li><em>Gorogoa</em> – $4.50 (70 percent off)</li> <li><em>Citizen Sleeper</em> – $6 (70 percent off)</li> <li><em>Blasphemous</em> – $6.25 (75 percent off)</li> <li><em>Dicey Dungeons</em> – $3 (80 percent off)</li> <li><em>Darkest Dungeon</em> – $7.50 (70 percent off)</li> <li><em>Kentucky Route Zero: TV Edition</em> – $10 (60 percent off)</li> <li><em>Risk of Rain 2</em> – $6.25 (75 percent off)</li> </ul> <p>I’ve already sung <em>Dicey Dungeons</em>‘ praises, but I want to give another special shoutout to <a href="https://kotaku.com/haiku-the-robot-hollow-knight-silksong-review-metroidva-1848910676"><em>Haiku, the Robot</em></a>. This is another one that was easy to miss when it came out a few years back. It’s a retro-styled Metroidvania that has some neat ideas but doesn’t overstay it’s welcome. There’s fun combat, some light platforming, and a great soundtrack. Plus a grappling hook. But it’s not an overwhelming maze or a gauntlet of brutal boss fights. It’s inspired by <em>Hollow Knight</em> but a much friendlier version of that formula, while still feeling authentic and charming. At just $4, it’s also a steal.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Wow, There Are Way Too Many Nintendo Apps]]></title>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/wow-there-are-way-too-many-nintendo-apps.1344850/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Today, <a href="https://kotaku.com/nintendo-store-app-play-time-session-switch-3ds-wii-u-2000641372">Nintendo launched a new Store app</a> for mobile phones that lets you wishlist, search for, and buy Switch and Switch 2 games on your phone. And that’s neat, but uh, why is this a separate app? Why does Nintendo keep insisting that you need one app to listen to music, another one to handle parental controls, and yet a few more to buy games, get news, and manage your Switch 2 console? It’s getting ridiculous.</p> <p>On November 5, the Nintendo Store App was released on mobile phones, letting users check out the Switch and Switch 2 eShop and even dig into some really interesting playtime data that the Mario maker has been collecting for years. Yet, <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/developer/nintendo-co-ltd/id1062496488">it also means Nintendo now has five separate non-gaming apps</a>.</p>

 <ul> <li>Nintendo Switch App</li> <li>Nintendo Music App</li> <li>Nintendo Today!</li> <li>Nintendo Switch Parental Controls</li> <li>Nintendo Store App</li> </ul> <p>Want to see which of your friends are online or manage your screenshots? <a href="https://kotaku.com/nintendo-switch-2-app-update-screenshots-upload-qr-code-1851782946">Use the Switch mobile app</a>. Want to buy a Switch 2 game on your phone? Well, download the newly released store app and use that. Also, the store app just opens a browser when you try to buy a game, so it’s not even that useful. Want to manage your console’s parental controls? Guess what, buddy? Go download another app. Curious about any new Nintendo news or announcements today? Fuck you, go download yet another app. Perhaps you wish to enjoy some music from your favorite Switch game, <em>Animal Crossing: New Horizons.</em> <a href="https://kotaku.com/nintendo-music-app-update-nes-games-donkey-kong-1851786691">Oh, you already know what I’m going to tell you: Download another app</a>.</p>

 <p>It’s all so strange and unnecessary. All of these apps feel barebones and not very useful because individually, each one only offers a few options and features. I’d much rather have a single Nintendo Switch app on my phone that contains a store, a little news section, and a way to manage my console and friends list. Breaking that out across three apps is silly. I’d even shove the parental controls into the main Switch app, too. This is mostly how Steam, Xbox, and PlayStation handle it, though Sony and Microsoft <em>also</em> break out parental controls into separate apps like Nintendo.</p> <p>Anyway, I’m excited for Nintendo to announce another new app next year that lets me change the visual settings on my Switch 2 and then another app that lets me manage my saves. I want 18 different Nintendo apps that I bounce between by 2030!</p>
