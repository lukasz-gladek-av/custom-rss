Those remaining exist in isolated equatorial environments with climates resembling the one in which they once thrived.</p><p>The three most colossal creatures within that tropical biosphere hold the key to a drug that will bring miraculous life-saving benefits to humankind.</p><p>Johansson plays skilled covert operations expert Zora Bennett, contracted to lead a skilled team on a top-secret mission to secure genetic material from the world’s three most massive dinosaurs.</p><p>When Zora’s operation intersects with a civilian family whose boating expedition was capsized by marauding aquatic dinos, they all find themselves stranded on an island where they come face-to-face with a sinister, shocking discovery that’s been hidden from the world for decades.</p></blockquote><p><em> Jurassic World Rebirth i</em>s directed by Garth Edwards (<em>Rogue One</em>, <em>Monsters</em>) and written by OG<em> Jurassic Park </em>screenwriter David Koepp. The new sequel is set to hit theaters on July 2 and stars Scarlett Johansson, Jonathan Bailey, and Mahershala Ali. </p><p> .<br></p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
