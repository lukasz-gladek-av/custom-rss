              <p>A smart way to seriously level up your aerial photography and filming game is by grabbing a solid drone camera. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4729/">The DJI Mini 3 Fly More Combo with DJI RC does a great job at that, and you can get your hands on this feature-packed bundle for less right now.</a></p>
<p>Amazon has dropped the price by 20%, bringing it down to $575. That’s almost $150 in savings, and you’re quite literally getting everything you need to start – three intelligent flight batteries, a dedicated controller with a built-in screen, a two-way charging hub, a shoulder bag, and more.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4729/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>4K HDR Recording, Plus a Solid Battery Life</h2>
<p>This is a lightweight drone, so it’s easy to carry around in the wild. It records in 4K HDR and supports Dual Native ISO, which means excellent visuals are a given, whether you’re shooting on a bright, sunny day or in the shadows. You can shoot vertically just as well, so it’s also great if you like sharing your stuff on social media and don’t want to bother with editing or cropping. Wind resistance pushes up to 38kph (Level 5), and there’s a 3-axis mechanical gimbal to let you shoot even with the breeze.</p>
<p>You will also be able to explore properly. This is made possible with the 10km max video transmission range that displays a live HD feed with minimal lag on the DJI RC’s built-in 5.5-inch HD screen, regardless of the distance. Then there are a bunch of handy features that make shooting less stressful. For instance, QuickShots take care of camera movements with built-in preset patterns; no need to worry about manual controls.</p>



<p>Of course, there’s nothing more frustrating than an almost-dead battery high up in the air. Here, you’re looking at up to 114 minutes of total flight time with the three included intelligent batteries. Larger areas and longer shoots won’t really be an issue. And since you’re also getting a two-way charging hub thrown in with your purchase, it’s going to be easy to juice everything back up between flights.</p>
<p>Those using a drone camera for the first time will appreciate features like Auto Takeoff, GPS Return to Home, and Precise Hovering. All of this makes it quite easy to get started confidently.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4729/">All in all, this Fly More Combo packs a lot of value for the price. This deal lets you snag it for 20% less than the retail price, but it won’t last too long.</a></p>

              <p>Getting kids started with Pokemon card collecting can get expensive fast when you’re buying individual booster packs at the store for $5 to $7 each with only 10 cards inside. Building up enough cards to actually trade with friends or organize by type requires buying multiple packs and suddenly you’ve dropped $50 without even getting any rare cards.</p>
<p>Amazon just slashed <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4271/">the price on their 50-card Pokemon bundle from $10 down to just $5, which works out to 10 cents per card</a>. This is the perfect starter pack for kids beginning their collection and (smart) parents are ordering four or five bundles at once to give their kids a substantial trading base right from the start.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4271/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Random Pokemon Cards</h2>
<p>The <strong>set includes 50 cards randomly selected from all Pokemon series</strong> from the old beginning of the card game in the original 1999 base set to the new releases. The set will comprise a variety of Pokemon character cards with some old favorites like <em>Pikachu</em> and <em>Charizard</em> to new generations kids are accustomed to from existing games and television programs. The <strong>set includes Energy cards too</strong> which are required to play the game as opposed to collecting the cards.</p>



<p>The random nature of the selection makes each package different and builds anticipation as you open the package because you never quite know what you’ll be receiving. This element of mystery replicates the booster pack buying experience at the market but you’ll be receiving five times the number of cards for the same cost. The randomness keeps kids getting Pokemon from various evolutionary levels, types, and power levels to introduce them to the depth of the Pokemon universe as opposed to receiving multiple copies of the same handful of characters.</p>
<p><strong>Duplicates happen within one set </strong>or across sets if you buy a bunch of sets at one time. This is actually a benefit rather than a flaw for children assembling collections, since replicas become desirable trade material. When your kid has two or three of the same card, they can trade the spares with others who need that particular Pokemon to fill out their set or construct a superior deck. Learn the value of negotiation, social interaction, and value exchange within the context of something enjoyable, not educational.</p>



<p>Each of the Pokemon cards features the character’s hit points (HP), attacks with costs in energies along with values of damage, weaknesses, resistances, and retreat costs. The cards with energies show the single type with the Pokemon energies that the children recognize. The cards are the same size, girth and quality as cards found in booster packs that can be purchased at retailers.</p>
<p>Buying four or five bundles makes economic sense because 50 cards is actually the beginning of a serious collection. Buying four or five bundles puts kids right out of the gate with 200 to 250 cards that instantly put together a substantial-looking collection. They can then construct dozens of finished decks with different Pokemon types, a slew of duplicates with which to trade, yet still retain a display collection of their very favorites. At $5 per pack, buying five packs still costs a grand total of $25, the same as buying five single booster packs at the store that would net you the same 50 cards anyway.</p>
<p>For $5 rather than $10, this is the cheapest Amazon has ever sold this set at.</p>

              <p>This past week, Amazon ran its seasonal Prime Day-adjacent sales event. The October one has been given the clumsy name Prime Big Deals Days, but don’t let that fool you. The deals were quite good, but unfortunately the event has come to a close. If you missed out on grabbing yourself something cool at a discount, no need to worry.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Amazon noticed there wasn’t much happening in October. September has Labor Day, November has Black Friday, but October was always quiet. That’s why it created its own shopping holiday: Prime Big Deal Days. The event officially ran from October 7 to 8, but even though it’s over, many of the best deals are still live. From lawnmowers and vacuums to laptops, Amazon seems in no rush to pull those discounts just yet. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4730/">This Acer Aspire 15 slim laptop has a pretty affordable starting price to begin with at $350. For the sale, Amazon has chopped off 20% which saves you a whopping $70. That brings the price you pay down to just $280.</a></p>
<p>So what’s this laptop working with? The Acer Aspire Go is powered by an 8-core, Intel Core 3 processor N355 with an integrated Intel graphics. It’s got 8GB of memory an 128GB of UFS storage. It’s a great little workhorse designed for browsing the internet, sending emails, and writing up Word docs. Sorry, you’ll have to go with something a little more powerful if you’re looking to play CyberPunk 2077 in ultra-high settings.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4730/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Portable and User-Friendly</h2>
<p>The laptop measures in at 15.6 inches with a super narrow bezel to maximize the screen real estate while keeping the computer compact. It displays in a resolution of up to 1080p Full HD which is plenty at that size. For bouts where you’re find yourself on the laptop for multiple hours at a time, you can turn on Acer BluelightShield. This reduces the levels of blue light to help less the effects of blue light exposure. Keep your eyes from feeling strained so you can get your work finished up.</p>



<p>As far as connectivity is concerned, you have a number of different ports along the sides of the Acer Aspire 15. Along the left, you’ll find two USB-C ports, one USB-A port, and an HDMI 2.1 slot so you can display on a second monitor. On the right side, you have one more USB-A port so you can connect to wired accessories like a mouse or external SSD. The laptop has Bluetooth 5.1 and Wi-Fi 6 support so you can utilize fast internet speeds when on a Wi-Fi 6 network.</p>
<p>Video call with colleagues, family or friends thanks to the on-board 720p HD web camera. It can capture high-quality footage even in low light conditions, plus can reduce noise and amplify your voice using AI.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4730/">Right now, Amazon has the Acer Aspire 15 slim laptop on sale for just $280 even after Prime Big Deal Days.&nbsp;</a></p>

              <p>LEGO Star Wars sets have become hot collectibles that fly off shelves even among people who’ve never seen a single movie. The appeal goes way beyond fandom: these are legitimate display pieces that look expensive sitting on a desk or shelf, and they provide hours of meditative building that actually helps you unwind after work.</p>
<p>This particular <em>Millennium Falcon</em> model celebrating the 25th anniversary of the Lego Star Wars line has a perfect 4.9 out of 5 stars from nearly 1,800 reviews and ranks as one of Amazon’s best-selling sets even at full price. Right now, <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4190/">Amazon has dropped it from $84 to just $67, which is the lowest price this set has ever been</a>.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4190/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Our Favorite Star Wars LEGO Set</h2>
<p>This isn’t one of the gigantic 7,500-piece LEGO sets that occupies half your dining room table for a month: The <strong>build with 921 pieces is big enough to be a true project but small enough that you can tackle it over a long weekend</strong> or a couple of easy evenings. The completed model is <strong>5 inches high, 9.5 inches long, and 7.5 inches wide</strong> which is a nice size to sit nicely on a bookshelf.</p>
<p>The model builds the Millennium Falcon as seen in <em>A New Hope</em> with true-to/detail features such as the characteristic cockpit offset to the right side of the vessel, the disc-shaped satellite dish resting on top, and the four-laser cannons placed at the upper and lower panels. The plates of the exterior embody the worn, lived-in appearance of the galaxy’s fastest hunk of junk with the greebling and textured panels that give depth and realism to the classic saucer form.</p>



<p>The included display stand is what elevates this from a toy to a legitimate decorative piece: The stand angles the ship at a dynamic tilt that makes it look like it’s banking through space during a chase sequence. This angled presentation adds visual interest and creates the impression of motion, which is way more engaging than a flat horizontal display. The stand includes a printed nameplate that reads <em>“Millennium Falcon”</em> along with a special 25th Anniversary Lego Star Wars commemorative brick, marking this as part of the anniversary collection.</p>
<p>In the $67 rather than $84 range, this offers a 20% savings as the lowest price this anniversary set has seen since release.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/amazon-forgot-to-end-this-prime-day-deal-15-6%e2%80%b3-portable-monitor-still-goes-for-peanuts-2000634484</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/amazon-forgot-to-end-this-prime-day-deal-15-6%E2%80%B3-portable-monitor-still-goes-for-peanuts.1323571/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>It’s easy to feel cramped up when you’re working or gaming on a single screen. An easier (and cheaper) solution than upgrading your entire setup is to add a second display, and bonus points if it’s portable. The 15.6-inch MNN portable monitor is an excellent option to consider for this, and right now, you don’t have to pay the full price for it.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3959/">It was already quite affordable at $90, but currently it sits at just $60 on Amazon after a 33% discount.</a> This discount is a limited-time one, so act fast to grab it while the offer is still live.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3959/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Slim, Portable Build With Impressive Visuals</h2>
<p>You’re getting a 15.6-inch 1080p IPS panel, which is the same as many full-sized laptop screens. Resolution pushes to 1920×1080 for a sharp, vibrant display, regardless of what you’re using it for. Visuals are pretty much consistent from any angle, and the matte finish helps cut down on reflections, so using it in brighter settings won’t be a problem. And since these specs match what you’ll find on many built-in laptop screens, you really won’t feel a drastic difference when switching between your main display and this one.</p>
<p>There are also multiple display modes for different tasks. We’re talking Extended Mode for a larger screen space, Second Screen Mode for a dual-monitor setup, Portrait Mode to use it as a vertical display, and more. Maybe go with the extended option while playing a game, and the portrait mode when you’re reading something!</p>



<p>Connectivity options include two full-feature USB-C ports and a mini HDMI port, meaning you can connect it to your laptop, PC, smartphone, tablet, MacBook, gaming console, or even a Switch. Just note that your device needs to support USB-C DP Alt Mode or HDMI output. If it does, a single USB-C cable that comes included in the box should be enough to handle both power and video.</p>
<p>The monitor itself is quite lightweight and easy to carry around. You’re also getting a scratch-proof smart cover made of durable PU leather exterior. It not only protects the screen from everyday wear and tear, but also doubles as a stand that you can use to easily prop the monitor up.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3959/">Altogether, this is quite an affordable option to consider if you’ve been wanting to invest in a second screen that works with a range of devices</a>. It goes with you wherever you go, and there are no compromises on the visual quality.</p>
