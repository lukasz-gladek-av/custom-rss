              <p>Sure, you can use your regular laptop for gaming, but those machines won’t really give you the immersive experience you’re hoping for. Even the supposedly powerful machines can struggle when it comes to demanding titles, which is why if you want to game seriously or maybe even work on creative tasks, you need hardware that’s specifically built for this.</p>
<p>Asus makes some of the best options out there, and right now, you don’t have to break the bank to grab one.<a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5058/"> Currently, the Asus TUF F16 Gaming laptop is going for just $1,660, thanks to a 54% discount on its $3,599 list price.</a> <strong>That’s a rare discount on this 2025 model, but it doesn’t end here</strong>. The bundle also includes an accessory box with a whole bunch of essentials to help you get started – for absolutely free. This is one of the biggest drops we’ve seen on a high-performance gaming laptop this year, but we don’t expect the discount to last long. Snag it up before the retailer pushes the price back up.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5058/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Brilliant, Immersive Graphics, Paired With a Fast Processor</h2>
<p>Asus has packed the machine with Intel’s latest 14th Gen i7-14650HX processor that can clock up to 5.2GHz. This ultra-fast processor is paired with 32GB of DDR5 RAM that keeps slowdowns at bay, even when you’re playing heavier titles or working with resource-intensive applications. There’s a 1TB SSD for storage, so housing all your essentials won’t be a problem.</p>
<p>Graphics are handled by the NVIDIA GeForce RTX 5060 GPU. Expect better frame rates, real-time ray tracing, and sharper visuals for an immersive experience. The 16-inch FHD+ IPS display takes the visual experience even further with a 165Hz refresh rate, Adaptive-Sync, and 100% sRGB color gamut that brings content to life.</p>



<p>Best of all, unlike most powerful gaming laptops out there, this machine stays quiet and cool while working. It features dual Arc Flow fans, full-width heat sinks, and built-in dust filters that make sure you enjoy consistent performance even during intense sessions. Connectivity-wise, you get Thunderbolt 4, USB-C 3.2, three USB-A ports, an HDMI 2.1 output, RJ45 Ethernet, and a 3.5mm headphone jack.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5058/">The free accessory bundle includes a gaming mouse, an RGB mechanical feel gaming keyboard, a six-pack cable organizer, and Windows 11 Pro pre-installed</a>. That’s all you need to get started right away! But again, just be sure to grab the offer before it expires for good.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Today marks a monumental moment for the saga of video games: it is the 20th anniversary of the release of Strangelite’s <em>Starship Troopers</em> PC game. On October 28, 2005, the world received a truly terrible game based on a truly excellent film, a concept that modern audiences couldn’t even hope to understand. A phenomenon I truly miss. What ever happened to the wildly incongruous video game adaptations of action movies?</p> <p>In the late 1980s and early 1990s, every Hollywood action outing would receive a tie-in video game. Publishers would have a side-scrolling platformer or 2D action game ready to accompany any major movie, no matter how utterly inappropriate or gloriously irrelevant it might be. And no, we’re not talking about some obscure, backwater companies you’ve never heard of—we’re talking the biggest names in the industry. Thus it was that in 1989 you could visit your local gaming store and pick up a copy of Activision’s <em>Die Hard</em>, developed by&nbsp;<em>Tribes</em> legends Dynamix, or the abysmal NES release <em>Who Framed Roger Rabbit</em> made by [double-checks notes] Rare.</p>

 <p>These tie-ins weren’t exactly famous for sticking particularly closely to the films on which they were based. While the <em>Die Hard</em> I mention above is very much set in Nakatomi Plaza, another version was made for PC Engine and TurboGrafx-16 that, incredibly, has you battling through jungles and rivers to reach the Nakatomi building in scenes that would feel more at home in a game set during the Vietnam war. More normally, however, these games were primarily about stripping out all nuance, subtlety, and subversion to create a straight-faced action game.</p>

 <figure id="attachment_2000639579" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000639579"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000639579">© Ocean / Mobygames</figcaption></figure> <p>Who can forget Ocean Software’s 1988 Amiga tie-in <em>RoboCop</em>, for instance, a surprisingly great side-scrolling action game ported from an arcade machine release? A beloved game it might have deservedly been, but it’s perhaps fair to say it might have somewhat missed the satirical elements of Paul Verhoeven ‘s film. Or perhaps the best example of all time: 2004’s <em>Fight Club,</em> released for PS2 and Xbox. And yes, that’s right, 2004. You aren’t losing your mind, David Fincher’s deeply subversive and satirical film was released in 1999, and this—wait for it—<em>fighting game</em> came out a full five years later. Was it, too, a treatise on the self-destructive psyche of male violence? No, it was not. It was a game about the actual fight club, the men beating the shit out of each other, and had you winning fights to rise up the ranks, until you’re eventually able to unlock Limp Bizkit’s Fred Durst as a playable character. I’m not making that up. It took an anti-capitalist, anti-violence film and said, “I like the bit where the man punched the other man.”</p>

 <p>There are obviously a squillion examples of truly horrendous movie tie-ins, like the notorious <em>E.T.</em> disaster or 2003’s&nbsp;<em>Charlie’s Angels</em> flop, but my favorite examples are always the ones that just woefully miss the point of their subject matter. And that’s why 2005’s&nbsp;<em>Starship Troopers&nbsp;</em>has such a fond place in my heart.</p>

 <p>Once again, no, you aren’t slipping loose from time. Paul Verhoeven’s wonderful&nbsp;<a href="https://kotaku.com/helldivers-2-starship-troopers-movie-disney-1851269272"><em>Starship Troopers</em></a> was released to theaters in 1997, a full eight years before Empire Interactive released this outstandingly terrible video game tie-in. The anti-war film certainly was, and still is, willfully misunderstood. That’s not because there’s any ambiguity, but because a lot of people aren’t very clever, misunderstanding its loudly telegraphed satire as a sincere representation of militaristic campaigning, seeing its excoriating portrayal of the modern military’s fascistic core as some sort of enthusiastic thumbs up for Nazism. Whether furious because they thought it was endorsing fascism, or delighted to think it was, people failed to understand this film from impressively diametric positions. (We can put aside the much-debated nature of the book on which the film mostly wasn’t based, given Verhoeven’s vision was clearly distinct and—given his childhood in Nazi-occupied Holland—not exactly in favor of the obvious baddies.)</p>

  <p>But the film isn’t exactly a work of subtlety. From its gruesomely silly “WOULD YOU LIKE TO KNOW MORE?” propaganda commercials to its sequences directly spoofing movies like <em>Platoon</em> and <em>Full Metal Jacket</em>,&nbsp;<em>Starship Troopers</em> wears its furious satire on its sleeve. Verhoeven’s genius in films like this and&nbsp;<em>RoboCop</em> (heck, even&nbsp;<em>Total Recall</em> if you look beyond the cheesy veneer) isn’t delivered quietly, but rather with unavoidable brutality. Which is all to say, no, this was never a film about brave Americans fighting off the cruel bug armies. Can you sense the foreshadowing?</p>

 <p>My favorite thing about the&nbsp;<em>Starship Troopers</em> PC game was the way it would lock up my PC, forcing hard reboots. This offered merciful little moments between having to play the game for the review I was writing at the time. Created by a British studio called Strangelite (who would go on to be bought by Rebellion and folded into the teams developing the <em>Sniper Elite</em> games), the game made its failure to comprehend its source material apparent before you’d even taken it out of the box. “Hesperus, a planet perilously close to Earth, has fallen to the bug menace,” it stated, ensuring you knew that a) it wasn’t going to try to recreate the events of the movie, and b) woefully didn’t realize that the Bugs never were a “menace.” That was kinda the point.</p> <figure id="attachment_2000639575" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000639575"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000639575">© Empire Interactive / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p>The game, a first-person shooter, was meant to be about taking on vast hordes of the arachnoid Bugs, desperately fighting to survive against the odds. Although those odds would often turn in your favor when all the dozens of identical enemies would choose to attack a nearby rock instead of you, kindly standing still while you shot them all in the side. It was a spectacular clusterfuck of atrocious graphics, dismal load times, lines of voice dialogue overlapping each other incoherently, and then to really drive home how bad this all was, super low-quality clips of the movie played at you to point out what it wasn’t portraying. (This reminds me of an utterly awful movie you hopefully never saw called <em>Carrie 2: The Rage</em>, that frequently included clips of Brian De Palma’s 1976 masterpiece to make sure you had constant context for just how outrageously terrible this sequel really was.)</p> <p>It sucked. That’s the point I’m trying to make.&nbsp;<em>Really</em> sucked. And you know what? I kind of miss that, a bit.</p>

 <p>Of late, we keep getting movie/TV tie-ins—albeit often years or decades later—that are really good! Games like 2023’s&nbsp;<a href="https://kotaku.com/robocop-rogue-city-new-game-2023-review-shooter-rpg-pc-1851000568"><em>RoboCop: Rogue City</em></a>, and 2022’s <a href="https://kotaku.com/tmnt-shredders-revenge-review-tribute-game-dotemu-multi-1849077972"><em>TMNT: Shredder’s Revenge</em></a>, that embrace the point of the source material in a winsome fashion. Which is brilliant, and bring it on! But there’s definitely a part of me that wishes 2025 could have seen a side-scrolling beat ’em up based on <em>One Battle After Another</em>, or a <em>Kpop Demon Hunters</em> platform game about collecting microphones. Where’s my egregiously misguided <em>The Fantastic Four: First Steps</em> third-person action game that tries to recreate major scenes from the film through minigames? We didn’t even get a top-down racing sim based on&nbsp;<em>F1 The Movie</em>.</p> <p>So happy 20th birthday,&nbsp;<em>Starship Troopers</em>, you colossal pile of shit. You were one of the last of your kind.</p>

              <p>What would <em>Shadow of the Colossus</em> have been like as an online game? Will <em>Civilization 7</em> finally be good before its one-year anniversary? And what lesson will publishers relying on game key cards for Switch 2 take from <em>Pokémon Legends: Z-A</em>‘s juggernaut physical sales? It’s the latest edition of Morning Checkpoint,&nbsp;<em>Kotaku</em>‘s daily roundup of gaming news and culture. Are you brave enough to <a href="https://x.com/mega64/status/1982951652811518329">spend a night in the Xbox haunted house</a>? The prices keep going up and the games keep leaving.</p> <h2><em>Pokémon Legends: Z-A</em> had the biggest physical launch since <em>Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom</em></h2> <p>That’s with around 6 million copies sold globally, <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/matpiscatella.bsky.social/post/3m46ottuejc2c">according to Circana</a>. <em>The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom</em> sold 10 million copies at launch despite being Nintendo’s first $70 game, with millions of those being physical copies as well despite the overall shift to digital games in recent years. At the time, the 2023 Switch hit pushed “new physical video game software spending” to its highest May total since May 2014.</p>

 <p>This tells us what we’ve already known: some franchises can still buck the trend when it comes to the disappearance of physical games, especially on Nintendo’s platforms. But the question remains: are controversial Switch 2 game key cards a way to satisfy that same demand, or a clumsy band-aid the company’s better ripping off sooner rather than later?</p>

 <h2><em>Call of Duty</em> is still trying to rain on <em>Battlefield 6</em>‘s parade</h2> <p><em>Black Ops 6</em> multiplayer and Zombies is once again going free from <a href="https://twitter.com/CallofDuty/status/1982928103417753961?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1982928103417753961%7Ctwgr%5E11d055f620a693ec5cf2b2fa9081b608928c48f7%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ign.com%2Farticles%2Factivision-announces-call-of-duty-black-ops-6-multiplayer-and-zombies-go-free-again-today-just-as-ea-launches-battlefield-battle-royale-redsec">October 28 through November 3</a>. Is that just a fun Halloween treat from Activision, or another attempt to trick players out of engaging with <em>Battlefield</em>‘s latest content drop? The EA competitor’s new, free-to-play battle royale mode is coming later today. <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-trails-far-behind-battlefield-6-on-steam-preorders">Data firm Alinea Analytics projects</a> that Call<em> of Duty: Black Ops 7</em> has sold under 200,000 pre-order copies so far on Steam, compared to <em>Battlefield 6</em>‘s million pre-orders during the same pre-launch period.</p>

 <h2><em>Civilization 7</em> is still trying to turn the corner</h2> <p>The embattled 4X strategy sequel will get a boost from the addition of a feature players have wanted since launch. Firaxis’ latest <a href="https://civilization.2k.com/civ-vii/news/civ-vii-update-check-in-oct-27/">status update on the status of its updates</a> says it’s currently testing lots of big changes, including an option to play as the same civilization throughout an entire match. One of the game’s big departures was forcing players to swap during age transitions. It’s by far one of the most unpopular new mechanics. Meanwhile, Tide of Power update 1.3.0 arrives next week with pirates and an overhaul of the game’s sea power dynamics.</p>

 <h2><strong><span dir="auto"><em>Shadow of the Colossus</em> started as an online co-op game because the dev loved <em>Battlefield 1942</em></span></strong></h2> <p>Creator Fumito Ueda reflected on the iconic 2005 PS2 game’s legacy in a recent interview <a href="https://news.denfaminicogamer.jp/interview/251027y#i-3">with <em>Denfaminico Gamer</em></a>. “<span dir="auto">Speaking personally, I used to play</span><span dir="auto">&nbsp;<em>Battlefield 1942</em></span><span dir="auto"> a lot at the time,” he said. “I was really impressed by the fact that all the characters on the screen were players, and I felt like, ‘This is the future of gaming.’ </span>I was really drawn to the energy and live feeling of online games, but at the same time, the feeling of excitement and disappointment over winning and losing gradually faded away.”</p> <p><span dir="auto">He continued, “I used to enjoy the excitement of competing against other people, but as I got older, I began to seek a different kind of immersion.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><span>Yesterday, the Trump Administration, in all its brain-rotting glory, posted </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/donald-trump-halo-gamestop-console-wars-meme-ai-images-2000639237"><span>an AI mockup of the president in Master Chief armor</span></a><span> as it declared that the man, who has likely never played a moment of </span><i><span>Halo </span></i><span>in his life, had ended the console war. This whole thing started because retail chain GameStop made a joke about the bitter feud between PlayStation and Xbox players finally ending, thanks to the impending arrival of </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/halo-remake-campaign-evolved-playstation-cross-play-2000638951"><i><span>Halo: Campaign Evolved </span></i><span>on PS5</span></a><span>. For some reason, the administration jumped in, presumably because someone on staff pays attention to video game news and only views the world through a memetic lens. Now, in what I can only assume is further committing to the bit, the White House has put out a statement declaring not only that&nbsp; Trump has ended a war, but that he is “hugely popular” with gamers.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>In a statement issued to journalist and ex-</span><i><span>Kotaku </span></i><span>editor </span><a href="https://www.patreon.com/posts/exclusive-white-142217261?utm_medium=clipboard_copy&amp;utm_source=copyLink&amp;utm_campaign=postshare_creator&amp;utm_content=join_link&amp;fbclid=PAZnRzaANtDVtleHRuA2FlbQIxMQABpz3WlKQSLeaQPnwHSgd_8kbdaOk9khYlDlkGwojXSUxrjZoBTQMEypzyzDjJ_aem_4-XJdI-3mwtRpkA9nPgsXQ"><span>Alyssa Mercante</span></a><span>, the White House said that he is the only leader “fully committed to giving power to the players,” which is a reference to GameStop’s tagline. So, taking this at face value, the Trump administration is claiming credit for Microsoft bringing its longest-running series to PlayStation, and saying that under his presidency, gamers are thriving.</span></p>

 <p><span>“Yet another war ended under President Trump’s watch—only one leader is fully committed to giving power to the players, and that leader is Donald J. Trump,” the statement reads. “That’s why he’s hugely popular with the American people and American Gamers.”</span></p>

 <p><span>Putting aside that this is obviously just some White House goon taking the piss out of a situation for the meme, the fact of the matter is, the video game industry has been </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/ps5-gta-6-price-switch-2-trump-tariff-2000618881"><span>thrown into a tailspin by the Trump administration</span></a><span>. The president’s </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/switch-2-price-trump-tariffs-vietnam-china-trade-war-1851774438"><span>tariffs have increased console prices</span></a><span> across the board, with </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/nintendo-switch-2-prices-pro-controllers-tariffs-amiibo-2000614471"><span>Nintendo</span></a><span>, </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/ps5-console-price-increase-sony-america-august-21-2000618873"><span>Sony</span></a><span>, and Microsoft all raising their respective price tags on systems and accessories over the course of 2025. Xbox </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/xbox-series-x-s-price-hike-raise-trump-tariff-microsoft-2000627228"><span>even did it twice</span></a><span>, though it does sound like Microsoft’s internal shifts </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/xbox-microsoft-price-hike-game-pass-layoffs-new-console-2000638546"><span>have contributed to that</span></a><span> as well.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>Trump has done tangible damage to the video game industry in the past 10 months, and yet, there’s an odd, concerted effort within his administration to brand him as some kind of gamer-friendly leader. This includes dumb shit like these memes, but also the Department of Homeland Security’s use of imagery from video games and anime, such as </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/department-homeland-security-halo-ice-pokemon-video-dhs-2000639308"><i><span>Halo</span></i></a> <span>and </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-responds-to-dhs-video-using-the-original-animes-theme-2000628222"><i><span>Pokémon</span></i></a><span>,&nbsp; to try and recruit people to ICE. Misinformation and fascist rhetoric is the Trump administration’s M.O., however, so they’re counting on people to clap and cheer at stupid posts of the president dressed as a character they like while he simultaneously undermines the very industry they’re a fan of. Anyone who falls for this isn’t paying attention, and if a fascist playing AI-generated dress-up as Master Chief is enough to get you to ignore this on top of all the bigger problems happening because of this idiot’s nationwide ego trip, we are well and truly fucked.</span></p>
