The idea was to offer a more powerful version of the Chromebook to those who wanted that extra oomph. And before Christmas, Google sent me a new Chromebook Plus from Acer so I could check out this device’s gaming capabilities. After a few weeks with it, I’m happy to report that this is a solid laptop that I might buy in the future. But it’s not a great way to play most games.</p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="197298" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="Live Forever in the Universe of 'New World: Aeternum'" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="108" data-playlist="197298,197284,197260" data-current="197298"><div><p>Live Forever in the Universe of 'New World: Aeternum'</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197298/197298_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197298/197298_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197298/197298_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197298/197298_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"></video></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>The Acer 516 GE is the specific <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://blog.google/products/chromebooks/chromebook-plus/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://blog.google/products/chromebooks/chromebook-plus/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Chromebook Plus</a></span> I was sent to review. And before I leap into my issues with streaming on it, I should clarify that the device itself is sleek, modern, has a solid battery life, and never gave me any technical issues. Watching videos, writing, and surfing the web using the Acer Chromebook Plus was a very enjoyable experience. </p><p>In the past, I’ve used Chromebooks and didn’t enjoy it. The stripped-down ChromeOS-powered laptops have been around for a decade or so now, but whenever I touched one, I always walked away disappointed by the lack of performance and function. </p><p>Now, in 2025, as more apps are web-based and mobile hardware has become incredibly fast, using a Chromebook isn’t painful. In fact, while using the Acer 516 GE I would forget it was a Chromebook, as many things I do every day on a computer—check my email, chat with co-workers, read news, and write stories—are done through a browser anyway. As a result, I never had a problem using the Acer 516 GE. Well, until I tried to play games. </p><figure id="" data-id="12fed492be1ba3a93a07c1d4adb1f9c9" data-recommend-id="image://12fed492be1ba3a93a07c1d4adb1f9c9" data-format="jpg" data-width="2900" data-height="1000" data-lightbox="true" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Acer / Google</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="12fed492be1ba3a93a07c1d4adb1f9c9" data-recommend-id="image://12fed492be1ba3a93a07c1d4adb1f9c9" data-format="jpg" data-width="2900" data-height="1000" data-lightbox="true" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>The <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.acer.com/us-en/chromebooks/acer-chromebook-plus-516-ge-cbg516-2h&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.acer.com/us-en/chromebooks/acer-chromebook-plus-516-ge-cbg516-2h" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">516 GE Chromebook Plus</a></span> is marketed heavily as a gamer-focused device. Google sent it to me, a writer at <em>Kotaku</em>, because its supposedly a gamer-friendly device. But if you know anything about ChomeOS and Chromebooks, you know that these things can’t play high-end games. The solution? The power of the cloud.</p><p>That’s the big selling point of the 516 GE. You don’t have to download games or worry about tech requirements. Just log into your preferred game streaming service and play stuff like<em> Cyberpunk 2077</em> or <em>Fortnite </em>instantly. And maybe, in another five years, this promise will become a reality, but for now streaming games is still a bad way to play stuff. </p><p>I tried <em>Fortnite, Cyberpunk 2077, </em>and <em>Gears 5</em> using different methods including Game Pass, Nvidia Geforce Now, and Amazon Luna. And while some were better than others, none of them matched the experience of playing a game natively on a device like a console or PC. </p><figure id="" data-id="afe4301ec93c83e2acd32ccf9b069fd3" data-recommend-id="image://afe4301ec93c83e2acd32ccf9b069fd3" data-format="png" data-width="1195" data-height="682" data-lightbox="true" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Acer / Google</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="afe4301ec93c83e2acd32ccf9b069fd3" data-recommend-id="image://afe4301ec93c83e2acd32ccf9b069fd3" data-format="png" data-width="1195" data-height="682" data-lightbox="true" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Now, you can install Steam on the 516 GE (it has a speical built-in feature to allow this) and using what I assume is Proton, I was able to play some 2D games like <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/balatro-poker-roguelike-worth-it-is-it-good-review-pc-1851283124&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/balatro-poker-roguelike-worth-it-is-it-good-review-pc-1851283124"><em>Vampire</em> <em>Survivors </em>and <em>Balatro</em></a></span><em> </em>just fine on the 516 GE. But that’s not impressive in a world where my phone can do that, too. No, the big selling point of this device is being able to play high-end, AAA video games on the go with no downloading and without having to shell out thousands of dollars on a dedicated gaming laptop.</p><p>Sadly, in 2025, even with Google Fiber internet (which I have), the 516 GE can’t remove the lag, choppiness, and visual artifacts that you encounter when streaming games. </p><p>So, if you are looking for a powerful Chromebook that can play some basic 2D games and retro stuff (I was able to get <em>Turok </em>running on it without any issues) then the 516 GE is worth checking out. Just don’t expect it and its game-streaming capabilities to replace your Switch, Steam Deck, or PS5 anytime soon. </p><p> .<br></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Take-Two might not need the extra money, but raising the price of<em> GTA VI</em> could give cover to other companies to raise their prices as well. The increasingly hollowed-out middle ground could go from charging $40 and $50 to $60 and $70, so the reasoning goes. Then again, in the current zero-sum environment, raising the cap could also just drive even more money away from smaller companies and lesser-known franchises. </p><figure id="" data-id="bd6b415eb1ea39c5ee1ec569ba6c6f8c" data-recommend-id="image://bd6b415eb1ea39c5ee1ec569ba6c6f8c" data-format="png" data-width="1192" data-height="848" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A screenshot shows how much of the gaming market is dominated by the top franchises.

" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>This isn’t the first time someone’s brought up the idea of <em>GTA VI </em>potentially breaking the current $70 price barrier. Take-Two CEO Strauss Zelnick has been <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/take-two-ceo-no-pushback-70-price-sega-zelda-gta-vi-2k-1850456925&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/take-two-ceo-no-pushback-70-price-sega-zelda-gta-vi-2k-1850456925">asked about it on investor calls in the past</a></span> and responds by saying the company always wants to overdeliver in terms of quality and value. That noncommittal response certainly doesn’t close the door to <em>GTA VI </em>being $80 or even $100, and Take-Two was one of the first companies to push existing games into $70 territory with the launch of the PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X/S.</p><p>Before that, premium boxed games had been $60 since the launch of the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-11-09/game-prices-go-up-to-70-the-first-increase-in-15-years?sref=P6Q0mxvj&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-11-09/game-prices-go-up-to-70-the-first-increase-in-15-years?sref=P6Q0mxvj" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">remaining stagnant for roughly 15 years</a></span> even while most other things around them got more expensive, including development budgets. When <em>GTA 3</em> came to PS2 back in 2001, it was $50. If it were <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.bls.gov/data/inflation_calculator.htm&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.bls.gov/data/inflation_calculator.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">adjusted for inflation</a></span>, it would cost $90 today. And in fact many big blockbusters, like <em>Call of Duty: Black Ops 6</em> and <em>Assassin’s Creed Shadows</em>, already have $100 versions for those players who want limited-edition skins, premium battle passes, extra in-game items, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/paid-early-access-pre-order-madden-star-wars-outlaws-1851596675&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/paid-early-access-pre-order-madden-star-wars-outlaws-1851596675">and early access to play ahead of the official launch</a></span> (the ultimate edition of <em>Monster Hunter Wilds</em> is even more at $110). </p><p>In his analysis, Ball points to a number of reasons why companies are so hesitant to raise game prices, or at least now use a one-size-fits-all approach to selecting them. The mere fact that game prices have historically not changed much has reinforced how “sticky” they are and leads to outsized player scrutiny any time price hikes are discussed. Other factors are competition from the rise of free-to-play games like <em>Fortnite </em>and <em>Genshin Impact</em> and the desire to reach as big a player-base as possible for battle passes, DLC, and other paid add-ons down the road. Plus it’s no secret how many people are already trained to wait just a few months for major discounts on everything but the best-selling games. </p><p>Nintendo recently showed that price hikes aren’t the end of the world when done smartly. It charged an extra $10 for <em>The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom</em> despite still being on the same hardware as the $60 <em>Breath of the Wild</em>. The game still went on to sell over 20 million copies and it also didn’t mean that <em>Pikmin 4</em> was all of a sudden going to cost $70 too (though it certainly would have still been worth it). <em>Baldur’s Gate 3</em> was only $60 on PC, but could have been another obvious contender for an $80 or even $100 game.</p><p>“I don’t love the artificiality of pricing structures post retail,” Larian Studios head of publishing, Michael Douse, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://x.com/Cromwelp/status/1828078408397623473&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://x.com/Cromwelp/status/1828078408397623473" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">wrote online last year</a></span>. “Use the inflated base price to upsell a subscription, and use vague content promises to inflate ultimate editions to make the base price look better. It all seems a bit dangerous &amp; disconnected from the community. I think a game should be priced accordingly with its quality, breadth &amp; depth. I’m not against higher prices, but this arbitrary uniformity just doesn’t make sense to me. It feels so unserious.”</p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
