Signing up in 2020, she said the relationship was ideal since it allowed her to maintain her privacy and focus on streaming as Ironmouse while the agency handled the business side of things. That seemed to go fine until recently, when VShojo allegedly stopped paying out funds it owed to the Vtuber and the charities she had supported. </p><p>“I believe that I am owed a significant amount of funds which I have not been paid,” Ironmouse said. “And most importantly, the Immune Deficiency Foundation is owed over half a million dollars from VShojo. I really wish that I could tell you more, but right now I have been advised to wait for legal proceedings. As of right now, I am an independent VTuber.”</p><p>The Vtuber suffers from an immunodeficiency disorder called CVID (Common Variable Immunodeficiency) and has frequently spoken about the importance of <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/twitch-ironmouse-streamer-most-popular-female-vtuber-vs-1848576685&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/twitch-ironmouse-streamer-most-popular-female-vtuber-vs-1848576685">the support provided by the  Immune Deficiency Foundation</a></span>. Ironmouse said she’s helped raise over $4 million for the organization over the years, with last year’s subathon expected to donate an additional $515,000 in money paid directly by fans through Twitch. While that money has allegedly never been paid out, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://tiltify.com/@ironmouse/ironmouse&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://tiltify.com/@ironmouse/ironmouse" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">a new Tiltify campaign</a></span> with a goal of $1 million for the foundation has already raised over $850,000. </p><p>VShojo did not immediately respond to a request for comment. </p><p>Ironmouse isn’t the only Vtuber currently speaking out against the agency. “I have been lied to from the company a lot about the situation,” Vtuber Kson <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://youtu.be/cBxw80mZoWI&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://youtu.be/cBxw80mZoWI" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">recently said</a></span>. “My payments stopped last September. I was asking what’s going on for a long time, multiple times. All they said was, ‘It’s going to be paid,’ and it was never paid, and I think it will never be.”</p><p>Vtuber Kuro also announced she’s leaving VShojo yesterday. “I didn’t want to say anything until its finalized but since people keep making assumptions, no I am not staying here I’ve already submitted a leave contract and had that meeting 11 days ago,” she <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://x.com/K9_KURO/status/1947656711524798886&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://x.com/K9_KURO/status/1947656711524798886" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">wrote on X</a></span>. “The only reason I still have the VShojo brand logo on here still is because they have to remove it themselves, as an associate u can not remove it yourself (same with everyone other member) in any case I’m just waiting for the contract to be all fulfilled and done but I guess I’m an indie now LOL.” </p><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.vshojo.com/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.vshojo.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Of the 13 Vtubers listed on VShojo’s website</a></span>, the majority have all posted messages announcing they’re taking breaks from streaming or explaining that they are cutting ties with the talent agency.

Users will be notified of their involvement via email and can opt in or out of the beta. One big feature being added in the update is the ability to have your PS5 controller sync up to multiple devices and switch between them quickly, no resyncing needed. It’s a nifty feature present on current-gen Xbox controllers and will make it easy to use your PS5 gamepad wirelessly on both your PC and console. But the more interesting news is an upcoming PS5 feature Sony is calling “Power Saver.” </p><p>Power Saver won’t be active in the beta, but will go live for everyone in the future. If users turn the optional feature on, the PS5 console will “scale back performance” while playing certain games in order to lower its power consumption. If games don’t support the feature, it won’t kick in. </p><p>Sony doesn’t go into great detail about what “scale back performance” means, but it does mention in some small print text at the bottom of the post that Power Saver won’t support VR games and that some “gameplay features may be limited.” To me, that seems to imply that you won’t be able to run some games at higher framerates when using Power Saver. And because VR demands high framerates to work, that would make Power Saver unusable. I also wonder if we might see some games turn off raytracing or other intense visual options when Power Saver is activated. </p><p>“At [Sony Interactive Entertainment], we are committed to Sony’s <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.sony.com/en/SonyInfo/csr/eco/RoadToZero/gm_en.html&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.sony.com/en/SonyInfo/csr/eco/RoadToZero/gm_en.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">‘Road to Zero’ environmental plan</a></span>, launched in 2010, which includes achieving net-zero greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions by 2040,” said Sony in the blog post. “We are always exploring how we can contribute to these goals through our products and services.”</p><p>Sony says it will share more details in the near future about Power Saver mode and how it will impact games as we get closer to the option going live. </p><p> .<br></p></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://kotaku.com/ps5-feature-power-saver-limit-performance-beta-update-1851786790]]></content:encoded>

Now, the studio has held a livestream to talk about the game’s <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://persona5x.com/news/details/000170xtpbmman.html&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://persona5x.com/news/details/000170xtpbmman.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">1.2 update</a></span> that goes live tomorrow, and players are saying the team hasn’t actually fixed anything, and in some cases, is only making things worse.</p><p>Some changes the patch brings about do acknowledge issues players have complained about; it adds more login rewards and gifts in response to players getting fewer rewards during their play time, for instance. However, while some rewards were rebalanced to be more in-line with the Chinese version, the patch doesn’t do anything on top of that to compensate for the accelerated schedule, nor does it implement higher chances to pull rare characters in the game’s gacha systems. A major point of contention is that characters are not being added to standard banner (basically the baseline pool of characters you can get when rolling for new Phantom Thieves to add to your party) until they have been in the game for six months. According to the stream, this is because the team wants to “act out of consideration for players” who use premium currency to acquire highly sought after characters, which fans have interpreted as the team saying they want to continue to incentivize players to pay up if they want a better chance of getting those characters.</p><p>“Straight up ‘we only care about people who spend money,’” nightoftheghouls <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/personaphantomx/comments/1m78qnk/truly_a_do_you_not_have_phonesor_surprise/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/personaphantomx/comments/1m78qnk/truly_a_do_you_not_have_phonesor_surprise/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">wrote on Reddit</a></span>. “You aren’t supposed to say the quiet part out loud guys.”</p><p>What remains to be seen is if this will be standard procedure for the game moving forward, or if it’s just being applied to some characters released in the game’s first month while the devs continue to adjust its monetization and release roadmap. Fans worry this might make the game a bigger money and time investment while the accelerated rollout is still in place, and create a grindier game with less payoff.</p><p>“So now not only do we have an insane release pace of new characters, we will not be able to get any of the ‘Standard’ characters going forward until at least 5 months from now?” N0tZekken <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/personaphantomx/comments/1m783mr/the_12_livestream_didnt_tackle_any_real_problem/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/personaphantomx/comments/1m783mr/the_12_livestream_didnt_tackle_any_real_problem/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">wrote in another Reddit thread</a></span>. “Keep in mind that they can actually pull it off for every new character, and they could actually make it worse. What’s preventing them from increasing this to a year if sales are not satisfactory? Wouldn’t be the first time we’ve been lied to in the face by Sega/Atlus.”</p><p>The comments on the live stream VOD are filled with similar disappointment, with several viewers expressing the idea that if the game were to just roll out exactly as it did in China, many of their issues would be fixed. But for now, non-Chinese players are dealing with an accelerated, FOMO-driven game that’s been changed in ways that offer no real benefit. Well, none for players, at least. Atlus stands to gain a lot by forcing players into situations where spending real-world money is the easiest fix. </p></div></div><br/><br/>https://kotaku.com/persona-5-phantom-x-livestream-marian-review-bomb-gacha-1851786799]]></content:encoded>
