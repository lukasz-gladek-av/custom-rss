New console-defining IPs have yet to arrive (maybe <em>Intergalactic: The Heretic Prophet</em>?) and the live-service money pit Sony went all in on has accomplished little while tying up some teams for years. </p><p>Anchored by both<em> Death Stranding 2</em> and<em> Ghost of Yotei</em>, it would be farfetched to call 2025 a bad year for PlayStation games, but it’s certainly still feeling like a lighter one overall for the platform. Despite big third-party releases like <em>Monster Hunter Wilds</em> and <em>Assassin’s Creed Shadows</em> early in the year, the second half feels lighter than it should for where we’re at in the PS5's lifecycle. Momentum should be building back up to another end-of-the-generation crescendo as developers squeeze every last optimization out of the hardware. It still feels like we’re waiting for the cavalry to arrive. </p><p>Enter Xbox. A steady <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/ps5-xbox-exclusivity-helldivers-spiderman-switch-2-1851787122&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/ps5-xbox-exclusivity-helldivers-spiderman-switch-2-1851787122">stream of multiplatform releases</a></span> and ports of prior exclusives is currently doing some very heavy lifting on PS5. Over half of the top 10 bestselling games on the console in the last quarter were from Microsoft, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://bsky.app/profile/matpiscatella.bsky.social/post/3lv6vqqhmyc2w&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://bsky.app/profile/matpiscatella.bsky.social/post/3lv6vqqhmyc2w" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">according to a new chart</a></span> shared this week by Circana director of game research Mat Piscatella.<em> Forza Horizon </em>5 and <em>The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion Remastered</em> were numbers two and three, while <em>Doom: The Dark Ages</em> and <em>Indiana Jones and the Great Circle</em> held down the sixth and eight spots, respectively. (Perennial chart-toppers <em>Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 </em>and <em>Minecraft</em> also put in work.)<br></p><p> Xbox games will continue bolstering the PS5's lineup throughout the year. <em>Gears of War: Reloaded </em>brings the franchise to PlayStation for the first time next month alongside <em>Senua’s Saga: Hellblade II</em>, with<em> The Outer Worlds 2</em> providing a big sci-fi RPG shooter for the fall. There’s also the Microsoft-published<em> Ninja Gaiden 4</em>, and any other fall releases the company hasn’t gotten around to announcing yet. How long before the rumored <em>Starfield </em>port arrives as well? And is there a version of <em>Halo</em> that comes to PS5 sooner than an upcoming remake of <em>Halo: Combat Evolved</em>?<br></p><p>No modern console is singularly defined by its first-party exclusives anymore (unless you’re Nintendo), but at a time when PlayStation Studios has temporarily stalled, long-time rival Xbox has turned out to be an unexpectedly fortuitous pillar helping to hold up the PS5 as it nears its twilight years. It’s all thanks to a multiplatform strategy that seemed unthinkable just a few years ago. If Microsoft had kept all of its recently acquired toys exclusive, as seemed increasingly likely as recently as 2023, this year might have felt like an especially dire one for PS5 players. Instead, Microsoft’s expensive new mega-publishing apparatus has helped the console recover from a series of self-inflicted fumbles. </p><p>.</p></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://kotaku.com/ps5-best-selling-forza-horizon-elder-scrolls-oblivion-1851787356]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>The gaming world hasn’t talked enough about how it feels to get good at the original <em>Ninja Gaiden</em> for the NES. I mean, I get it, it’s a notoriously brutal example of “Nintendo Hard” difficulty. I still have nightmares about those endlessly respawning birds that boomerang relentlessly around protagonist Ryu Hayabusa. Yet with enough time, practice, and memorization, it’s possible to lay those hordes of 8-bit foes low in a split second of precise button presses. Once overwhelming challenges give way to the intoxicating realization of “whoa, did I just <em>do </em>that?” where your hands react faster than your brain can process what’s going on. If it weren’t for the next threat lurking right around the corner, you’d just sit there in awe of how absolutely cool you felt.</p><p>I bring this up because The Game Kitchen’s <em>Ninja Gaiden: Ragebound</em> is a pure distillation of “whoa, did I just <em>do </em>that!?” with virtually none of the trial-and-error frustration that its predecessors demanded. Even if the developers hadn’t gone on record and <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.nintendolife.com/features/i-cant-believe-this-is-happening-the-game-kitchen-on-reviving-ninja-gaiden&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.nintendolife.com/features/i-cant-believe-this-is-happening-the-game-kitchen-on-reviving-ninja-gaiden" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">proclaimed their love for the series</a></span>, that deep level of mechanical understanding about what makes vintage <em>Ninja Gaiden </em>awesome would have been evident just from a few minutes of playing <em>Ragebound</em>. This team <em>gets it</em>.</p><p><em>Ninja Gaiden: Ragebound </em>makes its homage to its NES predecessors obvious from the jump. Opening with the fatal duel between Ryu’s father and the mysterious gray ninja that series fans will remember from the first console <em>Ninja Gaiden</em>, our story begins with Ryu taking up the Hayabusa family’s sword and heading to the United States on a quest for revenge. However, <em>Ragebound </em>immediately strikes its own path by instead following the story of Ryu’s protege Kenji, who stays at home to deal with the <em>rather small matter</em> of a demon invasion. That’s right, Ryu sticks around for a tutorial and a tricky boss fight that’ll put new players in their place, but afterwards he’s out for virtually the entire adventure. Vengeance waits for no one.</p><figure id="" data-id="7c24e25e4cf33a51a5e918c38acaec11" data-recommend-id="image://7c24e25e4cf33a51a5e918c38acaec11" data-format="jpg" data-width="2560" data-height="1440" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A gameplay screenshot shows a blue-clad ninja attacking a large blue monstrous figure of some sort on a wooden structure in the water.

Just as The Game Kitchen had to carve its own vision for <em>Ninja Gaiden </em>with respect to the works that came before it, so too do we follow a hero who carves his own destiny using the skills of his master. You’ll miss a few references and leitmotifs if this is your first <em>Ninja Gaiden</em>, but otherwise it’s perfectly accessible to newcomers.</p><p>Kenji’s path eventually crosses with Kumori, a kunoichi of the Black Spider Clan that stands opposed to the Hayabusas. Extenuating circumstances force Kenji and Kumori into an unholy alliance, and the two embark on a journey that sees them facing off against both man and demonkind alike. The beats from here on out share similarities to those of the first <em>Ninja Gaiden</em>, even if <em>Ragebound </em>is a self-contained side story. The <em>Ninja Gaiden </em><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://jisho.org/search/gaiden&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://jisho.org/search/gaiden" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Gaiden</a></span>, if you will.</p><h2 id="h623920"><a id=""></a>You’re that ninja</h2><p>While Kenji may be Ryu’s student, he plays just as fluidly as his master ever did. Whether he’s climbing walls, dodge rolling to pass through otherwise unavoidable attacks, or bouncing off enemies mid-air to execute sick aerial combos, every button press feels impeccably responsive. And despite the impressive range of attack and movement options Kenji has at his disposal, they’re all made possible through a simple control scheme that wouldn’t feel out of place in an actual SNES game.<em> </em>Aside from a few <em>very </em>specific quirks (does my aerial attack have a cooldown?), I always felt in complete control while playing <em>Ragebound</em>.</p><p>And trust me, I needed every tool in the toolbox to succeed. The earliest levels aren’t afraid to litter the screen with bad guys to take down, giving me little time to react before I’d take damage. Yet nine times out of ten, before my eyes could register everything that was happening, I’d perform a flurry of jumps, rolls, and slashes that’d clear the screen instantly. It’s not like I just relied on one tried-and-true strategy either, as I’d intuitively try attacks that just felt cool to do in the moment, often leading to huge payoffs.</p><p>While I’d like to chalk this up to my hardcore retro gaming skills, those consistent feelings of being <em>so cool </em>are a testament to how impeccably balanced <em>Ragebound </em>is. For instance, most enemies can be killed in a single strike, but there are also bulkier foes who won’t go down from one single, standard slash. Meanwhile, there are also glowing enemies who can grant Kenji a supercharged attack that cleaves right through these more imposing adversaries. This setup incentivizes you to think about the order in which you wish to take out your opposition, and even in chaotic situations, spotting a graceful way to navigate the fray and deploy those supercharged attacks on more formidable foes felt easy and natural. It helps that <em>Ragebound</em> features such fluidly animated pixel art that reading enemy attacks and telegraphs is a cinch. I didn’t master every encounter right off the bat, but I’d have a good idea of what I should have done differently to avoid a hit or keep my combos going.</p><p>Most importantly, <em>man</em>, does <em>Ragebound</em> feel as good as it looks. The sounds of cutting through small fry never get old, and those moments when the action stops just as Kenji uses a supercharged attack to slice a huge foe clean in half <em>really </em>convey the weight of the blow. I rode a consistent stream of “whoa, did I just <em>do </em>that!?” highs, whether or not I’d practiced a stage before. There were moments where I was completely immersed in a flow state, feeling just the right amount of adrenaline coursing through my veins as I played out ninja-based power fantasies I’d never actually realized I had.</p><p>And for all the ways in which its design elegantly encourages precision, I also always felt I had ample room to make mistakes, and <em>Ragebound </em>barely dwells on deaths before throwing Kenji back in the action. Rather than encouraging mastery through failure, the game feels <em>so </em>rewarding when played well that I never wanted to settle for a victory by the skin of my teeth. It helps that each stage looks and feels so distinctive that there’s nary a repetitive challenge to be found, even when bosses reappear later in the game. I could do without the two short vehicle-based autoscroller stages, but other than that, it’s all bangers here.</p><h2 id="h623921"><a id=""></a>I can’t believe it’s not Tecmo</h2><p><em>Ninja Gaiden: Ragebound</em> brilliantly evolves the gameplay of its vintage 2D predecessors in a way that feels fresh, modern, yet familiar all at once. I do wish I could say the same about its storytelling. I get that plot typically isn’t a priority in retro revivals like this, but the first <em>Ninja Gaiden </em>on the NES was a trailblazer when it came to narrative. The original manga-style cutscenes are well-directed given their vintage and limitations, and the story aimed high with surprise deaths, big plot twists, and a climactic finale. It’s nothing mind-blowing nowadays, but you just weren’t getting this kind of storytelling in stage-based action games back in 1989 (settle down <em>Astyanax </em>fans, I see you).</p><p><em>Ragebound </em>does start strong in this regard. The Game Kitchen utilizes its signature art style from <em>Blasphemous</em> to weave together some impressive cinematics that pay loving homage to the series’ origins. However, once the game enters its third act, the story mostly devolves into small quips between frenemies Kenji and Kumori with little else to keep the narrative exciting. I’d go as far as to say that 1989’s <em>Ninja Gaiden</em> actually makes <em>Ragebound</em> feel simple by comparison. There’s the occasional twist, but I never felt especially connected to what was happening on screen.</p><figure id="" data-id="9c62723dbd47cf9c1f7ef907bc91d058" data-recommend-id="image://9c62723dbd47cf9c1f7ef907bc91d058" data-format="jpg" data-width="2560" data-height="1440" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="An image from a cutscene shows the blue-clad ninja looking distraught, his head in his hand.

An older man sits across from him." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>It’s a shame, because <em>Ragebound</em> ends on a note that <em>should </em>have been meaningful and impactful had the buildup been better executed. The moment in question didn’t linger in a way that let me sit with what had happened either, which made the entire ending feel like clumsy tonal whiplash. Even completely disregarding the story, I thought <em>Ragebound </em>ended an act too soon. The set pieces in the end convey more “rising action” than “climax of the story,” a problem that I’m sure is observable by even the most dedicated cutscene skipper. By the time I hit the final boss, I was thinking less “oh this is <em>it</em>!” and more “oh, <em>this </em>is it?” It’s a bummer of a way to end an otherwise strong journey.</p><h2 id="h623922"><a id=""></a>It’s Blasphemously good</h2><p>I could certainly nitpick at <em>Ninja Gaiden: Ragebound</em> more. Hitboxes occasionally felt a little too big. I didn’t love a few of the enemy types near the end. The unlockable hard mode modifies an early game boss in a way that felt way too rigid, creating an awkward difficulty spike that the rest of that playthrough never wound up matching again.</p><p>Still, a few grievances and an underwhelming finale haven’t stopped me from returning to <em>Ninja Gaiden: Ragebound</em>, even after I’d seen everything I’d need to write a review. The moment-to-moment action just feels <em>so good</em>, and there’s enough variety between stages to make mastering each one a unique, worthwhile challenge. I’ve never fancied myself a high score chaser or a speedrunner, but all I can think about as I write this is picking up my controller and chasing max ranks on stages. Not because I have anything to prove or unlock, but because I want to see what other combos or tricks I can pull off. In a modern gaming landscape where we often need a slow drip-feed of rewards as encouragement to keep playing, it’s refreshing to see a game with such high replay value simply because it’s that tight and concise. Just the act of play is its own reward.</p><p><em>Ninja Gaiden: Ragebound </em>captures virtually everything that made 2D action games of yesteryear awesome while ironing out all the rough edges synonymous with that era of gaming. It looks spectacular, controls like a dream, and boasts levels that are worth experiencing over and over again. It does end too soon for its own good, and its short runtime may throw some people off. Aside from that, however, the developers at The Game Kitchen have proven themselves to be masters of their retro-inspired craft with this one. <em>Ninja Gaiden: Ragebound </em>is a worthy successor to its NES predecessors, without a boomerang bird in sight.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://kotaku.com/ninja-gaiden-ragebound-review-2d-blasphemous-1851787265]]></content:encoded>

However, players only control Donkey Kong this time around, with his usual sidekicks like Diddy and Dixie taking on supporting roles as non-playable characters. What does that mean for the prospect of co-op, though? Let’s talk about it.</p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="196165" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="What’s Coming Out Beyond Pokémon: The Indigo Disk | The Week In Games" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="95" data-playlist="196165,196646,196452" data-current="196165"><div><p>What’s Coming Out Beyond Pokémon: The Indigo Disk | The Week In Games</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196165/196165_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196165/196165_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196165/196165_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196165/196165_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/21711.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><h2 id="h614024"><a id=""></a>Does <em>Donkey Kong Bananza</em> even have co-op?</h2><p>If you’re looking to play <em>Donkey Kong Bananza</em> with a friend or family member, I’ve got some exciting news: <strong>The game features a co-op feature</strong>! One other player can join up and help you beat levels, but it just might not be in the way that you think. But what can you do with it? </p><p><strong>Co-op in <em>Donkey Kong Bananza</em> doesn’t split the screen and give a second player full control of their own DK-like hero in the game world.</strong> Instead, it allows them to control Donkey Kong’s adorable companion Pauline as she rides along his shoulder. Because of this, the second player is rather limited in their moveset, not getting to experience the rolling, punching, or general sense of momentum that comes from playing as the game’s titular star.</p><p>However, that doesn’t mean that Pauline is useless. She’s anything but! While controlling Pauline, <strong>the second player can copy materials around a level, then shout that material at enemies or obstacles to deal damage</strong>. This can help with clearing paths, and it’s especially helpful for dishing out damage to bosses.</p><p>You can play <em>Donkey Kong Bananza</em> via local co-op or online. Even cooler, <strong>by using GameShare, you can temporarily allow your friend or family member (especially young children) to join your game with their own Switch or Switch 2, even if they don’t own the game themselves</strong>. Whoever’s controlling Pauline also doesn’t have to worry about abilities cooling down. They can spam away, which can make the game even more fun and chaotic.

We’ve compiled the top ten highest selling cards in the split sets.</p><p>It was <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/pokemon-tcg-black-bolt-white-flare-zekrom-reshiram-1851786202&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-tcg-black-bolt-white-flare-zekrom-reshiram-1851786202">obvious that Black Bolt and White Flare’s special black Zekrom and white Reshiram cards were going to be popular</a></span>, but perhaps not <em>this</em> popular. I’ll save the prices for the slideshow, but if you pull one, things are sweet. However, what I wasn’t expecting was that the red Victini card—found in both sets—would match them for cost.</p><p>Black Bolt and White Flare are Pokémon’s first English-language foray into a real-world split set. That means there are squillions of cards unique to each pack type—a situation made all the more confusing and frustrating by this being a so-called “special set” where packs cannot be bought separately, only as part of collection boxes and Elite Trainer Boxes. It seems likely that this extra layer of difficulty in getting hold of the cards, in a situation where that was already close to impossible thanks to scalpers, could be driving up resale prices.</p><p>And that sucks. Kids who just want to buy the pretty card of their favorite Pokémon are unable to buy product in stores, and are wildly priced out of buying them as a single. We’re even seeing some of the more common Illustration Rares going for over $100. To put this in context, usually when I compile these pieces, the tenth-most-expensive cards are usually around the $20 mark, sometimes even less. In this top ten, we’re not going to drop below $77. It’s all completely out of control, and given The Pokémon Company isn’t planning on easing back any time soon—September sees the start of the crowd-pleasing <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/pokemon-tcg-cards-mega-evolution-leak-lucario-latias-1851786474&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-tcg-cards-mega-evolution-leak-lucario-latias-1851786474">Mega Evolutions sets</a></span>—it’s hard to see it getting better.</p><p>Still, if you managed to find some packs to open and pulled any of the following, you’re damned lucky. Rather than compiling two separate lists, I’ve combined the two sets together and picked the highest prices from both sides. I’ll mark which set each is from, in case you’re chasing.</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="6f92d53c1b703001ced1b6efe24927b0" data-recommend-id="image://6f92d53c1b703001ced1b6efe24927b0" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="720" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="N’s Plan Special Illustration Rare - Black Bolt" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="N’s Plan Special Illustration Rare - Black Bolt" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->The Pokémon Company / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="6f92d53c1b703001ced1b6efe24927b0" data-recommend-id="image://6f92d53c1b703001ced1b6efe24927b0" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="720" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="N’s Plan Special Illustration Rare - Black Bolt" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>I find myself incapable of reading “N’s Plan” without parsing it as “Nsplaining,” and now assume the guy is always telling female trainers how to look after their Pokémon. This card is such an interesting evolution of the more usual trainer full-art cards, given life and tone and detail, plus that incredible out-of-focus ferris wheel in the background. Still though, it makes no sense <em>at all</em> that this currently sells for <strong>$74</strong>.</p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="f98ca74d18e69b872f20875ec75f6caf" data-recommend-id="image://f98ca74d18e69b872f20875ec75f6caf" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="720" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Keldeo ex Special Illustration Rare - White Flare" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Keldeo ex Special Illustration Rare - White Flare" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->The Pokémon Company / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="f98ca74d18e69b872f20875ec75f6caf" data-recommend-id="image://f98ca74d18e69b872f20875ec75f6caf" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="720" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Keldeo ex Special Illustration Rare - White Flare" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>The prettiest card in all the land, Keldeo just squeaks by Black Bolt’s far more plain N’s Plan by a dollar. I’m delighted it’s doing so well, because it’s the loveliest. Artist Yuu Nishida is one of the best on the roster, since starting on Shining Fates in 2021. In any previous year, this card would likely cost you about 20 bucks, and I’d seriously consider buying one. But in this broken timeline it’s going for a whopping <strong>$75</strong>.</p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="86a47271a5844e959309a4e9809b4a25" data-recommend-id="image://86a47271a5844e959309a4e9809b4a25" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="720" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Hilda Special Illustration Rare - White Flare" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Hilda Special Illustration Rare - White Flare" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->The Pokémon Company / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="86a47271a5844e959309a4e9809b4a25" data-recommend-id="image://86a47271a5844e959309a4e9809b4a25" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="720" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Hilda Special Illustration Rare - White Flare" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Well, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/pokemon-tcg-black-bolt-white-flare-zekrom-reshiram-1851786202/slides/5&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-tcg-black-bolt-white-flare-zekrom-reshiram-1851786202/slides/5">I called this one</a></span>. The “inevitable waifu card” storms in at <strong>$85</strong>, although to be fair, it’s also a lovely depiction of a bunch of enormous Pokémon. Hilda is a good card to have in your deck if you’re playing a line that needs evolving, but you can pick up the regular version for cents.</p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="0bf9766b7ce4e628231998e2cbaf4d1e" data-recommend-id="image://0bf9766b7ce4e628231998e2cbaf4d1e" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="720" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Hydreigon ex Special Illustration Rare - White Flare" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Hydreigon ex Special Illustration Rare - White Flare" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->The Pokémon Company / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="0bf9766b7ce4e628231998e2cbaf4d1e" data-recommend-id="image://0bf9766b7ce4e628231998e2cbaf4d1e" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="720" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Hydreigon ex Special Illustration Rare - White Flare" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>This was obviously going to be a popular card—just look at it—but I’m surprised it’s not <em>more</em> popular. You’ll see we’re about to encounter the really big cards from this set, dominating the top half of the prices, but I cannot understand why it’s not ahead of what’s to come next. This is the sort of card that could have seen $200 or $300 itself in a set with fewer big hitters, and I wonder if with time, it’ll build up momentum. For now, it’s yours for <strong>$99</strong>.</p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="1ef157dbdaf97bdd2bde96a898b6bffc" data-recommend-id="image://1ef157dbdaf97bdd2bde96a898b6bffc" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="720" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Seismitoad Illustration Rare - Black Bolt" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Seismitoad Illustration Rare - Black Bolt" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->The Pokémon Company / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="1ef157dbdaf97bdd2bde96a898b6bffc" data-recommend-id="image://1ef157dbdaf97bdd2bde96a898b6bffc" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="720" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Seismitoad Illustration Rare - Black Bolt" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>OK, I love the art. It’s spectacular. And perhaps that’s purely what’s behind the enormous prices being fetched for a card that’s far easier to pull than any of those above. Shinji Kanda’s art is stunning, and has gained a lot of love and attention since Lost Origin’s <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.serebii.net/card/lostorigin/186.shtml&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.serebii.net/card/lostorigin/186.shtml" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Giratina V</a></span> (a card that will still cost you $500).</p><p>But the fact is, this is an Illustration Rare, not a Special Illustration Rare, and as such should pull far more often, which you’d imagine would lower prices. Goodness knows where this would be if it were harder to find. Right now, it’s selling for <strong>$180</strong>, and that price is only trending upward.</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="601a3a62331a6381b598f15ce5c3b5f6" data-recommend-id="image://601a3a62331a6381b598f15ce5c3b5f6" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="720" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Reshiram ex Special Illustration Rare - White Flare" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Reshiram ex Special Illustration Rare - White Flare" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->The Pokémon Company / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="601a3a62331a6381b598f15ce5c3b5f6" data-recommend-id="image://601a3a62331a6381b598f15ce5c3b5f6" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="720" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Reshiram ex Special Illustration Rare - White Flare" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>God, it really is a testament to the mindblowing quality of art in this set that this isn’t the highest priced card. It’s <em>astonishing</em>, possibly artist Kawayoo’s best ever across 217 illustrated cards over 16 years. This is the same person who gave us Silver Tempest’s stunning <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.serebii.net/card/silvertempest/186.shtml&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.serebii.net/card/silvertempest/186.shtml" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Lugia V</a></span>, but I think the Reshiram knocks it out of the park. It also helps that this is one of the flagship Pokémon in the set, pushing prices even higher. And how much? Grit your teeth: <strong>$219</strong>.</p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="e1d6ed415d7e1c881d2e0a2563ffd9d7" data-recommend-id="image://e1d6ed415d7e1c881d2e0a2563ffd9d7" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="720" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Zekrom ex Special Illustration Rare - Black Bolt" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Zekrom ex Special Illustration Rare - Black Bolt" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->The Pokémon Company / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="e1d6ed415d7e1c881d2e0a2563ffd9d7" data-recommend-id="image://e1d6ed415d7e1c881d2e0a2563ffd9d7" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="720" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Zekrom ex Special Illustration Rare - Black Bolt" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>Look, there’s only about ten bucks in it, but I still feel a need to complain that this Black Bolt Zekrom card is outpricing its White Flare equivalent Reshiram.

This is an alternative art version of a basic card that is currently priced at $0.15, and it’s not even an especially good card to have in your deck.</p><p>This sounds like I’m building up to shaking my head in disbelief at the ridiculous price, and that’s partially true. However, it’s so much stupider than that.</p><p>Victini here appears in <em>both</em> sets of cards—it’s the only card that does. Even the basic version is only in Black Bolt.
