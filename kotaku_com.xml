            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Earlier this week, a post on the official <i>No Man’s Sky</i> subreddit highlighted what clearly looks like some digital theft. Some premium cosmetics in the free-to-play survival game <i>Once Human</i> look virtually identical to teleporters in space exploration game <i>No Man’s Sky</i>.</p> <p>While a circular object that can teleport someone has been a staple of science fiction since at least the film <i>Stargate</i>, the more you look at these two 3D assets, the more similarities you’ll spot; they’re virtually indistinguishable save for a different color theme. Managing director for <i>NMS </i>dev Hello Games, Sean Murray, was one of the many internet denizens who took note (<a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/survival/no-mans-sky-lead-responds-to-reports-of-stolen-assets-in-fellow-open-world-survival-game-once-human-says-the-jokes-on-them-because-theyre-actually-unfinished/">h/t <i>GamesRadar</i></a>). Though instead of expressing outrage, he’s taken a more playful approach, pointing out an oversight in the original design.</p>

 <p>“Jokes on them” <a href="https://x.com/NoMansSky/status/1995953990958547164?s=20">Murray wrote on X</a>, “we forgot to LOD those rivets 😅”</p> <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">jokes on them – we forgot to LOD those rivets 😅 <a href="https://t.co/XYvgdFXLas">https://t.co/XYvgdFXLas</a> <a href="https://t.co/KXRD3F5X1i">pic.twitter.com/KXRD3F5X1i</a></p> <p>— Sean Murray (@NoMansSky) <a href="https://twitter.com/NoMansSky/status/1995953990958547164?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 2, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <p>So if the assets are indeed ripped from <i>No Man’s Sky</i>, it will come with some very unoptimized geometry for <i>Once Human</i> to wrestle with.</p>

 <h2>The heck is a LOD?</h2> <p>“LOD” stands for “<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Level_of_detail_(computer_graphics)">level of detail</a>.” Various objects in any given 3D game will have different LODs depending on how far away from the object a viewer is. The further you are, the less detail there is on the object. This aids in rendering and stress on the machine producing the geometry. There’s no sense in having a fully detailed 3D object if you’re many miles away. Here’s <a href="https://youtu.be/w0bKkGqV5JQ">a video demonstrating the technique</a> in <i>Breath of the Wild</i>:</p>   <p>So next time you’re playing a massive open-world game, now you know why objects look a little funny from a vast distance—especially if you’re playing <i>Once Human</i> and looking at some allegedly stolen assets.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/where-winds-meet-ai-npc-llm-chatgpt-steam-2000650074</link>
            <guid>1371664</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Whether we wanted it or not, we’ve stepped into a world where AI is increasingly sneaking into our games. Free-to-play multiplayer Steam hit <i>Where Winds Meet</i> is one of the latest examples, using an LLM-based chatbot for many of its NPCs that players can talk with. Or flirt with. Or “socially” engineer into completing quests without actually doing the work by talking to them like Solid Snake.</p> <p><b>Read More:</b> <a href="https://kotaku.com/arc-raiders-leaper-kill-spaceport-trials-into-the-fray-2000649665">Open-World RPG <i>Where Winds Meet</i> Has It All: Evil Geese, AI Chatbots, And A $40,000 Skin</a></p> <p>Developed by Chinese-based Everstone Studio, <i>Where Winds Meet</i> is a veritable Mulligan stew of countless modern gaming conventions, as well as AI NPCs that trade scripted, canned lines of dialogue for, in theory anyway, a more dynamic and unpredictable experience. Others might describe it as lifeless. I’m inclined to agree, but the tech isn’t without its amusing quirks and exploits. One such player seems to have proven this by flirting with the tech until it…well, it did something <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/wherewindsmeet_/comments/1pd0pgi/removed_by_moderator/?embed_host_url=https://www.thegamer.com/where-winds-meet-ai-npc-flirting-reply/">raunchy enough for a Reddit mod to take it down</a> (<a href="https://www.thegamer.com/where-winds-meet-ai-npc-flirting-reply/">h/t <i>The Gamer</i></a>).</p> <p>Though the screenshot taken by Reddit user Oglokes24 is now in horny jail, we can glean some context clues from the comments. The flirting seemed to involve Okglokes24 lying to an NPC to say that “her husband died” and, well, whatever it was, one user replied: “You should be locked up.” “Sex minigame when?” reads another comment. “Ban incoming,” states another.</p> <p><i>Kotaku</i> has reached out to Oglokes24 about the contents of the now-deleted screenshot.</p> <h2>AI…Chatbots?</h2> <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/chatgpt-ai-discord-clyde-chatbot-exploit-jailbreak-1850352678">Since LLMs hit the web</a>, folks have been finding all sorts of ways to trick them into doing things they’re not supposed to. Insert that tech into a game, and it’s no surprise that people are finding ways to get it to do things it’s not really supposed to. That includes some clever players realizing that if you talk to <i>Where Winds Meet</i>’s AI chatbots as Solid Snake would, by restating various phrases back to the NPC as a question, you can bypass certain quest win conditions.</p> <p>In a Reddit post documenting the so-called “<i>Metal Gear</i> method” (<a href="https://www.pcgamesn.com/where-winds-meet/npc-chatbots-gaming">h/t <i>PCGamesN</i></a>), a user was able to end a quest just by rephrasing everything the NPC said back as a question.</p> <figure id="attachment_2000650075" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000650075"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000650075">© Screenshot: Everstone Studio / Hakkix</figcaption></figure> <p>Based on comments from other players, the tech behind these pseudo-sentient NPCs isn’t as sophisticated as something like ChatGPT, so it’s a bit easier to find ways to screw with it. While I admit the prospect of interacting with NPCs via natural language is neat, I certainly am unwilling to trade thoughtful, well-written characters for this junk.</p>

              <p>I’m a humble man with simple needs. It turns out what I really look for in games is a really good bumpity-bumpity-bumpity noise while sliding down a flight of stairs. If it weren’t already <a href="https://kotaku.com/arc-raiders-extraction-shooter-constantly-dying-2000649095">packed with a squillion other good reasons</a>, this would still be enough on its own to have me booting up <em>Arc Raiders</em>.</p> <p>Let’s not mince words: sliding down a flight of stairs is great. From bumping down the carpeted steps on my bottom as a child, to launching myself down headfirst on a sleeping bag as a teenager, it’s an ideal way to spend a wet afternoon before a trip to the ER. As an adult, however, my significantly less resilient frame tends to object to such antics, and falling down the stairs has become the stuff of nightmares, likely to bruise a bone such that I’ll complain for a month. So thank goodness for <em>Arc Raiders</em> and its simulation of the joyful action.</p>

 <figure id="attachment_2000650070" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000650070"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000650070">© Embark Studios / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p>In&nbsp;<em>Arc</em>, like so many first- and third-person shooters, when you hit the crouch/crawl button while sprinting, it plunges your character into a sliding skid that is primarily programmed into most games to look cool. However, in Embark Studio’s extraction shooter, the action has multiple benefits. First and foremost, there’s the looking cool, but beyond this, skidding is a fast way to descend hills without draining your stamina. In fact, you can actually regain stamina during a skid, and when well-timed, it’s the perfect means of escape from a feisty gang of angry drones. Run, crouch, and slide down the dusty slopes, then regain enough energy to sprint off into a nearby doorway at the bottom.</p>

 <p>But it’s not until you attempt this move at the top of a flight of steps, whether they’re in a concrete bunker or from a metal walkway, that you discover the utter life-affirming joy that’s on offer here. Sliding down steps is the smoothest, most satisfying movement in a video game since&nbsp;<em>Kingdom of Amalur: Reckoning</em>‘s forward roll. Its perfection is a combination of factors that I shall lay out for you, scientifically:</p>

 <ol> <li>It’s not just a gimmick, but a very effective means of movement, especially when trying to escape danger</li> <li>It’s an uninterrupted and effortless slide with no tiresome movement penalty at the end</li> <li>You go “ba-dada, ba-dada, ba-dada” as you bump down the stairs at such speed in the most rewarding aural element in all of gaming history</li> </ol> <p>Sometimes when I’m playing, I’ll see other players just running down stairs and not sliding, and I worry. I worry that either they&nbsp;<em>don’t know</em>, and thus the vital necessity of this article. Or far, far worse, they&nbsp;<em>do&nbsp;</em>know and yet choose not to. These are broken people, and we need to have a way to report them not for bad play, but for the emotional support they so desperately deserve.</p> <p><em>Arc Raiders</em>‘ stair slides are a deep pleasure in difficult times, a sublime all-rewarding action that delivers both function and form, and it would be a sin against all that is positive not to celebrate them.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/bose-flex-bluetooth-speaker-drops-to-all-time-low-on-amazon-now-cheaper-than-budget-options-2000650056</link>
            <guid>1371613</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Amazon is still running Cyber Monday prices well into December, so people who missed the first sales rush can still get the <strong>Bose SoundLink Flex</strong> at a lower price. This portable <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5691/">Bluetooth speaker is now $119 instead of the regular $149 price</a>&nbsp;which means that premium Bose audio is now available at a mid-range price, where you would normally find speakers with bad sound quality.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5691/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Great Sound</h2>
<p>The SoundLink Flex has PositionIQ sensors that can tell if you’ve put the speaker upright, flat, or hanging from its utility loop. It then automatically changes the audio output to keep the sound quality at its best no matter how the speaker is positioned. This awareness of space is important because speaker drivers send sound in a certain direction, and what sounds balanced when you’re standing up can sound muddy or thin when the speaker tips over. The onboard processing changes the audio profile in real time, so the speaker works the same whether it’s on a picnic table, in your shower, or clipped to your backpack while you hike.</p>
<p>Bose designed the acoustics around a custom transducer and two passive radiators that give the small enclosure (3.6 by 7.9 by 2.1 inches) a surprising bass response. The passive radiators vibrate in sync with the active driver, which makes the low-frequency output go beyond what the small cabinet volume would normally produce. This bass emphasis doesn’t drown out the mids and highs because Bose tuned the frequency response to keep vocals and instruments clear even at high volumes. With complex music, you’ll be able to hear the different parts clearly instead of everything blending together into a mushy mess like cheaper portable speakers do.</p>



<p>The IP67 rating means that this speaker is truly waterproof, not just splash-proof like many of its competitors claim. It can also protect against dust and submersion up to one meter deep for 30 minutes. After a day at the beach, you can rinse it off under the faucet or let it float in the pool without worrying about water damage. The outside is covered in silicone, which protects against scratches, rust, and UV damage when the device is outside for a long time.</p>
<p>Bluetooth 5.3 lets you connect to your paired device wirelessly up to 30 feet away and uses less power than older versions of Bluetooth. This helps the battery last longer between charges, up to 12 hours. Bluetooth 5.3 has more bandwidth, which means that audio compression artifacts that can make sound tinny or distorted on lower-quality speakers are less likely to happen. With multipoint pairing, two devices can connect at the same time. This means that you and a friend can take turns controlling music without having to keep disconnecting and reconnecting through Bluetooth settings.</p>



<p>The speaker charges through USB-C instead of the older micro-USB standard which means you can use the same cable that charges new phones and laptops to charge the speaker. The battery can charge quickly to a partial charge when you need to leave but forgot to charge it overnight. The speaker is only 1.3 pounds, so you can easily fit it in a daypack without adding too much weight or bulk.</p>
<p>The SoundLink Flex is a strong competitor with brands that can’t match its combination of sound quality and durability because it costs $119, which is a lot less than what you’d normally pay for Bose audio quality. The $30 off might not seem like much compared to some holiday deals, but Bose doesn’t often offer big discounts on its speakers, so any price drop is important.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 Had A Big Launch, Game Pass Helped Make It Even Bigger]]></title>
            <link>https://kotaku.com/clair-obscur-expedition-33-game-pass-xbox-goty-2000650073</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Would <a href="https://kotaku.com/clair-obscur-expedition-33-rpg-review-in-progress-1851777402"><em>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</em></a> have been just as big without <a href="https://kotaku.com/game-pass-2025-new-releases-doom-fable-ninja-gaiden-1851746651">a Game Pass deal</a>? Sandfall creative director creative director Guillaume Broche doesn’t seem to think so. On Wednesday, Microsoft crowned the RPG its most popular third-party Game Pass launch of 2025, and Broche thinks the marketing and word-of-mouth from subscribers trying the game for free helped propel it to being one of the year’s biggest hits.</p> <p>“Fresh from sweeping the Golden Joysticks and poised to do the same at The Game Awards, Sandfall Interactive’s phenomenal debut RPG is one of the most buzzed-about releases of the year, so it should surprise no one when we announce that <em>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</em>&nbsp;is the biggest new third-party game launch on Xbox Game Pass of 2025,” Microsoft announced <a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2025/12/03/clair-obscur-expedition-33-game-pass-biggest-launch/">in a new blog post</a>. “That’s based on the number of unique users in the first 30 days of its availability, which means a huge number of Xbox players joined Maelle, Gustave, Esquie, and the gang on their journey right from the beginning.”</p>

 <p>If that sounds a bit like Xbox trying to steal some credit for the game’s success, Broche doesn’t seem to think it’s completely unwarranted. “From being there to announce our game back in Summer 2024, to coming to the studio for the Developer Direct video in January, Xbox helped us get the word out there and reach a lot of players,” he said.</p>

 <p>Being on Game Pass also let “a lot of people try our game when maybe they might not have before.” The turn-based RPG genre has a lot of fans, but sometimes it might put people who prefer more real-time action games off. Game Pass lowered that barrier of entry. They could just try it and see how it feels. So a lot of curious players could start the game, explore Lumière and the early game, and realize there’s a lot to enjoy here, even if they weren’t expecting it at first.”</p>

 <p>That was back in April when Game Pass was still just $20 a month. If <em>Clair Obscur</em> were coming out today, players would need to shell out <a href="https://kotaku.com/xbox-game-pass-gets-massive-price-hike-yet-amid-big-changes-2000630604">$30 a month</a> to have that same barrier to entry lowered. The Game Awards frontrunner is a good example of a Game Pass deal working out for everyone involved, but is it just the exception that proves the rule? As the service gets more expensive and deals for most indie releases get smaller, it’s unclear if Game Pass can keep a good thing going or will <a href="https://kotaku.com/xbox-game-pass-cancel-controversy-console-pc-2000631061">continue to enshitify</a>.</p> <p>Microsoft says the service is profitable and generated $5 billion in revenue, but it also hasn’t released new subscriber numbers in over a year. Maybe the platform will land another <em>Clair Obscur</em>-sized hit out of nowhere in 2026, or maybe this year will be remembered as the one that Game Pass peaked in.</p>
