If successful, it would be a big move for Sony, gaining names as big as <em>Elden Ring</em>, <em>Dark Souls</em>, and <em>Danganronpa</em>, and be a strike back against Microsoft’s recent major purchases.</p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="195502" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="The Most Sought After Elden Ring Sword Has A Storied History" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="307" data-playlist="195502,194718,193534" data-current="195502"><div><p>The Most Sought After Elden Ring Sword Has A Storied History</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195502/195502_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195502/195502_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195502/195502_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195502/195502_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/20979.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p><em>Reuters</em> reports that “two sources familiar with the matter” informed them that Sony is in talks to purchase Kadokawa, a company that reported $1.7 billion in revenue in 2024. The news network adds, “The talks between the two sides are ongoing and, if successful, a deal could be signed in the coming weeks, the sources said.”</p><p>Kadokawa is a Japanese media conglomerate that owns a huge array of businesses, across manga, anime, tourism, video streaming, and some of the most significant names in Japanese games development. That includes Spike Chunsoft, the developer behind <em>Danganronpa</em>, <em>Mystery Dungeon</em>, and most recently, <em>Dragon Ball: Sparking! Zero</em>, as well as Acquire, co-developers of <em>Octopath Traveler </em>and, intriguingly, the developers of the just-released Nintendo exclusive, <em>Mario &amp; Luigi: Brothership</em>.</p><p>It would also be another capturing of territory in the anime space, with companies like Doga Kobo, ENGI, Glovision, and many others, alongside the <em>Anime News Network</em>, and a vast swathe of Japan’s manga publishing houses. With Sony already owning Crunchyroll and Funimation, there are obvious concerns over Sony’s dominance in this area.</p><p>Of course, the headline name is FromSoftware, responsible for <em>Dark Souls</em>, <em>Armored Core</em>, <em>Bloodborne</em>, and <em>Elden Ring</em>. It would be a massive coup for Sony to own those names, and of course raise massive questions about whether it would see some of the most popular games in the world becoming PlayStation exclusives.
