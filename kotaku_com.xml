Discovery announced that <em>Guardians of the Galaxy</em> director James Gunn and producer Peter Safran were taking over all DC movies and TV shows moving forward. The pair would be co-CEOs of the newly formed DC Studios division. Then, in December 2023,<em> Aquaman and the Lost Kingdom</em> landed in theaters as the last movie officially released as part of the Zack Snyder era of DC. The first project created by Gunn and Safran as part of the new DCU was the animated show <em>Creature Commandos</em>, which ended its first season earlier this month. According to Gunn, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://gizmodo.com/james-gunn-dc-slate-info-flash-aquaman-justice-league-1850051467?_gl=1*447nv2*_ga*MzQzNjkwNDM2LjE2NDY2NjQ1NzQ.*_ga_V4QNJTT5L0*MTczNzQ4MzczMi4zMDkuMC4xNzM3NDgzNzM1LjU3LjAuMA..&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://gizmodo.com/james-gunn-dc-slate-info-flash-aquaman-justice-league-1850051467?_gl=1*447nv2*_ga*MzQzNjkwNDM2LjE2NDY2NjQ1NzQ.*_ga_V4QNJTT5L0*MTczNzQ4MzczMi4zMDkuMC4xNzM3NDgzNzM1LjU3LjAuMA..">everything after C<em>reature Commandos </em>(and the show itself)</a></span> is canon unless specified otherwise. Everything else isn’t. That makes it sound so simple. But it ain’t that simple. </p><h2 id="h33132"><a id=""></a>Are <em>Suicide Squad</em> and <em>Peacemaker </em>canon in the DCU?</h2><p>On January 20, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://bsky.app/profile/jamesgunn.bsky.social/post/3lg6v5b55jk22&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://bsky.app/profile/jamesgunn.bsky.social/post/3lg6v5b55jk22" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">James Gunn was asked about a plot point</a></span>, the death of Rick Flag in the non-canon film<em> The Suicide Squad</em>, which is mentioned in<em> Creature Commandos</em>. And the director and CEO of DC Studios explained that moving forward, only <em>Creature Commandos</em> is “pure canon.” Some older stuff, like his 2021 movie <em>The Suicide Squad,</em> could be considered an “<span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://bsky.app/profile/jamesgunn.bsky.social/post/3lg6v5nvtnk22&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://bsky.app/profile/jamesgunn.bsky.social/post/3lg6v5nvtnk22" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">imperfect memory</a></span>” of what happened. Also, the 2022 show <em>Peacemaker </em>is “almost entirely consistent” with the new canon, but just ignore the scenes involving the Justice League at the end.</p><p>Okay, so let’s recap: What’s canon in the DCU? <em>Creature Commandos</em>, all the shows and movies that come out afterward,<span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/superman-trailer-james-gunn-krypto-dog-lex-luthor-1851725124?_gl=1*xwqb6a*_ga*NzE0NzM5NTc5LjE3Mjk4Njg5MzU.*_ga_V4QNJTT5L0*MTczNzQ3NTczNC4xNDQuMS4xNzM3NDg1ODY1LjYwLjAuMA..&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/superman-trailer-james-gunn-krypto-dog-lex-luthor-1851725124?_gl=1*xwqb6a*_ga*NzE0NzM5NTc5LjE3Mjk4Njg5MzU.*_ga_V4QNJTT5L0*MTczNzQ3NTczNC4xNDQuMS4xNzM3NDg1ODY1LjYwLjAuMA.."> like 2025's <em>Superman</em></a></span>, and <em>some </em>parts of<em> Suicide Squad</em> and most (but not all of) <em>Peacemaker</em>. That’s it, right? Well, no. It gets more complicated! </p><p>In 2023, before <em>Aquaman</em>, DC released <em>Blue Beetle</em>. The movie was a massive box office flop and it isn’t part of the new DCU. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.thewrap.com/blue-beetle-first-character-dc-universe-james-gunn/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.thewrap.com/blue-beetle-first-character-dc-universe-james-gunn/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">But the <em>Blue Beetle</em> hero featured in the movie <em>is</em> in fact part of the DCU</a></span>, and the actor who played him will return in the future in an <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://deadline.com/2024/06/blue-beetle-animated-series-dc-studios-1235973196/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://deadline.com/2024/06/blue-beetle-animated-series-dc-studios-1235973196/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">animated series</a></span> that will reference the movie, but will be a canon adventure in the DCU. </p><p>Oh and speaking of confusing, the <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.cbr.com/james-gunn-peacemaker-season-one-isnt-canon/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.cbr.com/james-gunn-peacemaker-season-one-isnt-canon/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">second season of <em>Peacemaker</em></a></span><em> </em>starring John Cena will be part of the DCU even though the first season is sort-of-but-not-actually canon. </p><p>To summarize: The DCU canon consists of <em>Creature Commandos</em>, all future DC movies and TV shows (except some stuff like <em>The Batman 2</em>), the Blue Beetle character but not the movie he appeared in, parts of <em>The Suicide Squad</em>, and most of <em>Peacemaker’s </em>first season but not really and all of its second season. Got it? Well, if not, just reread this thing or tweet at James Gunn. I’ve tried my best to explain it all and my head hurts so I’m going to go take a nap. </p><p>&nbsp; .<br></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

A tooltip will eventually let you know that you can break boxes around the map to earn additional Materials, but by the time it gives you this information, you may have already passed up a handful of them. </p><p>So, hey, I just figured I’d let you know to <strong>keep an eye out for boxes with a glow around them</strong> because I’m a nice guy who wants you to be able to afford to buy the first Magic Vial from the Craftery, which will net you an extra Relic slot. You’re welcome. No, really, don’t sweat it.</p><h2 id="h60119"><a id="yolvan"></a>Put Yolvan to good use</h2><figure id="" data-id="fd2e211b684edf2259ade60666005773" data-recommend-id="image://fd2e211b684edf2259ade60666005773" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A homunculi fires a projectile at an enemy." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A homunculi fires a projectile at an enemy." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Adglobe / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="fd2e211b684edf2259ade60666005773" data-recommend-id="image://fd2e211b684edf2259ade60666005773" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A homunculi fires a projectile at an enemy." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>During the game’s opening hour or so, you’ll fight Yolvan and earn him as a Homunculi that you can equip. Since he fires projectiles, <strong>assign Yolvan to your shoulder button attack slot so that you can hold his attack down</strong> while you use melee attacks, too. This can massively improve the speed at which you deplete the Break Gauge of basic enemies, allowing you to pummel them into submission.</p><p>When the Craftery begins selling Mixed Parts (pretty early on), make sure to buy some and use them to <strong>purchase Yolvan’s Eviscerate ability</strong> to make him even more of a force to be reckoned with. Holding down the button for this ability will unleash a tornado attack that stuns several enemies at once while dishing out surprisingly good damage in the process. Since it can hit multiple enemies at once, it’s a pretty great upgrade over his basic attack in most scenarios.</p><h2 id="h60120"><a id="muninn"></a>Always keep Muninn out</h2><figure id="" data-id="348a9af92abbaf67eaa8aa59458e813f" data-recommend-id="image://348a9af92abbaf67eaa8aa59458e813f" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A flying homunculi accompanies the protagonist." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A flying homunculi accompanies the protagonist." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Adglobe / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="348a9af92abbaf67eaa8aa59458e813f" data-recommend-id="image://348a9af92abbaf67eaa8aa59458e813f" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A flying homunculi accompanies the protagonist." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>You’ll get Muninn when exploring the Magicite Mine. This Homunculi can be equipped and summoned to accompany you passively. Unlike most Homunculi, this means you don’t have to press any buttons to make Muninn attack. Instead, it will fly around behind you and occasionally auto-attack foes.</p><p>While this Homunculi doesn’t deal significant damage, it does help to chip away at the Break Gauge of your enemies without you having to micromanage any cooldowns or remember to press any buttons. </p><p>And, of course, if you’d like Muninn to bug off, just hit the assigned button again to send it packing. But, like, why would you not want the help? Are you too good for a friendly owl pal? Don’t be like that.</p><h2 id="h60121"><a id="helix"></a>Don’t miss the Helix Crystal Relic</h2><figure id="" data-id="132302d0e3fdcba175087133be7055fb" data-recommend-id="image://132302d0e3fdcba175087133be7055fb" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A screenshot shows the location of a relic." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A screenshot shows the location of a relic." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Adglobe / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="132302d0e3fdcba175087133be7055fb" data-recommend-id="image://132302d0e3fdcba175087133be7055fb" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A screenshot shows the location of a relic." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>You’ll start the game with only a handful of replenishable healing wards, so a bit of passive healing sure would be nice, right? Luckily, you can grab the Helix Crystal early in the game, which will heal you for 3% of your total health every time you defeat an enemy. It may not sound like much, but there are a lot of enemies that are fairly easy to defeat along your path, so it certainly adds up. </p><p>When you’re ready to get it, play until you get the Lower Stratum Key a few hours in, then fast-travel back to the Abandoned Attuner Tent. Head left from the Abandoned Attuner Tent, and open the door to access the Magicite Mine. Inside, head down the slope and all the way to the left until you encounter a rather large foe. Defeat him and grab the Helix Crystal.</p><h2 id="h60122"><a id="difficulty"></a>Lower the difficulty if you’re struggling to git gud</h2><figure id="" data-id="806a571fa9f69ca79cafa616dc7c06cd" data-recommend-id="image://806a571fa9f69ca79cafa616dc7c06cd" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A screenshot shows difficulty options." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A screenshot shows difficulty options." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Adglobe / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="806a571fa9f69ca79cafa616dc7c06cd" data-recommend-id="image://806a571fa9f69ca79cafa616dc7c06cd" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A screenshot shows difficulty options." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>While <em>Ender Magnolia</em> is designed to challenge you, it’s perfectly fine if you decide you’d like to reduce the degree to which it does so. Luckily, <strong>you can adjust the difficulty when resting at a Respite</strong>. You can opt to select from multiple presets, or you can manually adjust various aspects of enemy difficulty, such as health, attack frequency, and more. Do what feels right to you. I’m not here to judge.</p><hr><p><em>Ender Magnolia: Bloom in the Mist</em> is available now for PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Xbox One, Xbox Series X, Nintendo Switch, and PC.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

They also explain one line that’s still in the film that doesn’t make much sense without all the scenes it was referencing.</p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="196123" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="What’s Coming Out Beyond The Day Before | The Week In Games" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="125" data-playlist="196123,195859,196805" data-current="196123"><div><p>What’s Coming Out Beyond The Day Before | The Week In Games</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196123/196123_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196123/196123_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196123/196123_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196123/196123_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/21655.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><figure id="" data-id="afpvuwnfoibrncd6upmy" data-recommend-id="image://afpvuwnfoibrncd6upmy" data-format="png" data-width="800" data-height="88" data-lightbox="true" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><span data-id="afpvuwnfoibrncd6upmy" data-recommend-id="image://afpvuwnfoibrncd6upmy" data-format="png" data-width="800" data-height="88" data-lightbox="true" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Originally, Jim Carrey’s burnt-out version of the mad scientist Doctor Eggman was going to be moonlighting as a live streamer. Having been bested by Sonic and friends twice in the previous films, the Egghead was going to have pivoted to talking to his adoring fans and promoting energy drinks that were probably not good for you.</p><p>There are two scenes that would have had Eggman interrupting the plot to stream to his followers. They contain some funny gags, such as Agent Stone enthusiastically spamming heart emojis on his boss’ stream because <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/sonic-movies-eggman-robotnik-agent-stone-stobotnik-gay-1851738189&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/sonic-movies-eggman-robotnik-agent-stone-stobotnik-gay-1851738189">he’s clearly in love with him</a></span>, but still, it’s easy to see why these scenes were cut. In the context of the already busy movie, they likely would have just interrupted the flow and momentum of the action, and frankly, there’s already plenty of Carrey’s antics to go around (maybe too much). But seeing them now does contextualize one line that still made it into the final movie during Carrey’s final monologue.</p><p>At the end of the film, Eggman sacrifices himself to save Earth as he helps Shadow move the self-destructing Eclipse Cannon out of the planet’s orbit. But before he does, the doctor streams a goodbye message to Agent Stone after carelessly tossing him aside earlier in the movie. When he does so, he opens the stream with “This is Dr. Ivo Robotnik dedicating my final live stream to one very special henchman: Agent Stone.”</p><p>The use of the word “final” implies that there were others which, in the finished film, seems a little odd because we hadn’t seen Eggman streaming prior to this moment. While it makes sense that these scenes were deleted, the real shame is that we didn’t get to see Agent Stone yearning and nursing Eggman back to health after the end of <em>Sonic the Hedgehog 2</em>. Stobotnik shippers are not taking it well, but at least we’re seeing it now thanks to the digital release.</p><p>These scenes are fun to see, but the most interesting behind-the-scenes content coming out of Paramount right now are the new pieces of concept art which may have <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/new-sonic-3-concept-art-may-clear-up-that-confusing-pos-1851743775&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/new-sonic-3-concept-art-may-clear-up-that-confusing-pos-1851743775">answered some of the lingering questions from <em>Sonic 3</em>’s post-credits scene</a></span>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
