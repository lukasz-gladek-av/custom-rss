              <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/clair-obscur-expedition-33-rpg-review-in-progress-1851777402"><em>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</em></a> has now sold over 5 million copies and the developers at Sandfall Interactive are celebrating that milestone by teasing a free new update for the critically acclaimed RPG. When it arrives, the mini-expansion will add new locations and bosses, giving players fresh targets for their increasingly broken builds.</p> <p>Sandfall hasn’t announced a release date yet for the new<em> Clair Obscur</em> content but confirmed it won’t be paid and should be available to players across PS5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC at the same time.&nbsp;Here’s everything fans can expect from the free update:</p>

 <blockquote> <ul> <li>A new, playable environment, taking the characters of<em>&nbsp;Expedition 33</em>&nbsp;to a brand-new location with new enemy encounters and surprises to discover.</li> <li>Challenging, new boss battles for late-game players to overcome.</li> <li>New costumes for each member of the Expedition, giving even more customization options for players throughout their adventure.</li> <li>New text and UI game localizations into Czech, Ukrainian, Latin American Spanish, Turkish, Vietnamese, Thai and Indonesian, bringing the total number of supported languages to 19.</li> <li>Plus, even more surprises fans can look forward to.</li> </ul> </blockquote> <p>“The response to our game has been nothing short of incredible,” creative director Guillaume Broche said in a press release. “We spent years working on our dream project, and to know it has resonated with fans around the world in such a powerful way is both wonderful and overwhelming. We’re so grateful to our fans for their love of the world we created, for sharing their own fan art and music covers, for wearing their best Baguette cosplays to conventions, and for being incredibly supportive of our game. We hope the update we’re working on will act as a ‘thank you’ to those fans for their support–please be patient while our team work hard on bringing you something worth the wait.”</p> <p>On many people’s shortlist for GOTY, <em>Clair Obscur</em> arrived with little fanfare back near the start of 2025 and quickly made waves thanks to its great storytelling and excellent twist on traditional turn-based combat. Sandfall Interactive’s developers have been on a victory tour ever since, including visiting a number of top game companies in Japan <a href="https://kotaku.com/final-fantasy-clair-obscure-expeidition-33-turn-based-1851786927">like Square Enix</a>. In addition to the update, we already know the team is <a href="https://kotaku.com/clair-obscur-expedition-33-sequel-sandfall-interactive-2000620688">planning to work on a sequel</a>. Now all we need is confirmation that it’ll come to Switch 2 at some point.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><span>Last night on </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/wordle-jimmy-fallon-game-show-host-nbc-savannah-guthrie-2000632667"><i><span>The Tonight Show</span></i></a><span>, the singing voices of </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/kpop-demon-hunters-best-worst-songs-soundtrack-ranking-2000616633"><i><span>KPop Demon Hunters</span></i></a> <span>performed together for the first time. Ejae, Audrey Nuna, and Rei Ami’s voices have been heard by millions of people in the musical and its soundtrack, but other than a brief cameo on last weekend’s </span><i><span>Saturday Night Live</span></i><span>, we hadn’t heard them perform together outside of the studio. While I would have loved for it to be on a stage that wasn’t in proximity to Jimmy “We don’t know what fascism is on this show” Fallon, hearing the voices of Huntr/x absolutely nail the anthemic “Golden” on stage was delightful. What a victory lap.</span></p> <p><span>The performance was set to footage from the movie, including both of the major scenes in which the group sings “Golden” in the musical. It starts with footage from the music video premiere that debuts the song to the public, and ends with Huntr/x’s performance of the song at the Idol Awards in the film’s third act. Catch me feeling sentimental seeing this performance, as it echoes the movie itself, in which fans had to wait for quite some time to hear Huntr/x perform the song live because of all the demon-hunting drama going on behind the scenes. But also, as many fans point out in the comments, this is the first time Ejae, the voice of lead singer Rumi, has performed live in many years. She has primarily worked behind the scenes in the music industry, and now she’s finally getting to sing her #1 song to an audience of millions.</span></p>   <p><span>Elsewhere in the show, Fallon revealed to the group that the </span><i><span>KPop Demon Hunters </span></i><span>soundtrack has gone platinum, having sold one million copies in the U.S. alone. What a special night, and hopefully there are more to come. It would be great to hear more songs from the movie down the line. I’m crossing my fingers for a performance of “What It Sounds Like” with a choir backing the girls up.</span></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>LEGO is one of those brands that pretty much anyone can enjoy. Doesn’t matter if you’re just a kid or a kid at heart in an adult-sized body. Building a LEGO set piece by piece is fun, peaceful, and rewarding all at the same time. Plus at the end, you have some sick Marvel or Star Wars toy to play with or display. The only problem is LEGO can be crazy expensive, and the rare times they do go on sale, it’s not that hefty of a discount or sells out in minutes. We’ve been greeted with a rare exception though thanks to Prime Big Deals Days. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4616/">Amazon has the LEGO Star Wars Ahsoka Ghost and Phantom II spaceships for 30% off. The set is normally priced at $160, but that discount brings it down to just $112</a>. You’ll end up saving a whole $48.</p>
<p>The Ghost is the main spaceship helmed by the heroes of the <em>Star Wars Rebels</em> animated series in the Spectres rebel cell’s long fight against the forced of the Galactic Empire. Later, when Disney announced an Ahsoka series, we all knew that would mean seeing more characters and iconography from the animated Star Wars canon. Sure enough, we got the Ghost in live action. And now, in LEGO.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4616/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>2 LEGO Star Wars Ship</h2>
<p>This 1,394-piece set contains both the modified VCX-100 light freighter known as the Ghost and its auxiliary vessel the Phantom II (first one was destroyed at Reklam Station so it does not come in LEGO form).</p>
<p>The Ghost included two lever-activated spring-loaded shooters, a cockpit with a removable front which can fit two minifigure pilots, two hatches that open up, plus a turret with a hood that can fit a minifigure working the gun.</p>
<p>The Phantom II shuttle also has an opening LEGO minifigure cockpit plus a storage compartment. I can even connect to the Ghost freighter.</p>



<p>The full build measures in at over 4.5 inches high, 13.5 inches long ,and 10.5 inches wide. It’s not ginormous like some of the Death Star or Star Destroyer builds but it’s no Happy Meal toy either.</p>
<p>The build becomes easier when using the LEGO Builder app. You can view each step with a 3D digital version to see all those weird angles that don’t print well in the instruction booklet, allowing you to zoom in and rotate the model around. You can even save your progress if you need to walk away from your build partway through.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4616/">For Prime Big Deals Day, save $48 on the LEGO Star Wars Ahsoka Ghost and Phantom II spaceships.</a></p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/jackery-explorer-1500w-generator-is-now-60-off-amazon-is-clearing-out-stock-just-before-winter-2000633138</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/jackery-explorer-1500w-generator-is-now-60-off-amazon-is-clearing-out-stock-just-before-winter.1319533/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Power outages and off-grid adventures share a common problem: <strong>keeping your essential devices charged and running when wall outlets aren’t available</strong>. Portable power stations solve this by packing serious battery capacity and multiple charging ports into a format you can actually move around, and Jackery’s <em>Explorer 1000</em> has become the benchmark in this category.</p>
<p>The company has made aggressive pricing moves during Prime Big Deal Day to make this 1500W power station affordable: It started the event at $449, dropped to $399, <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3722/">and has now hit $349, down from the standard $799 price</a>. This Prime-exclusive offer expires tonight when the promotional event closes, giving members just hours left to secure this pricing.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3722/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Capacities and Outputs that Fulfill Your Needs</h2>
<p>The Explorer 1000 is home to a 1070Wh LiFePO4 battery which means usable runtime that you can plan your adventures around. This <strong>battery will charge a laptop about 10 times, power a mini-fridge about 13 hours</strong> or keep your phone powered for weeks. LiFePO4 chemistry is notable because these batteries have substantially longer lifespan compared to the common lithium-ion battery and last about 4,000 charge cycles before the battery’s capacity falls as low as 70%.</p>
<p>The <strong>1500W AC output powers large appliances</strong> that small power stations cannot handle. You can power power tools in a work site, use a space heater when camping, or maintain a coffee maker percolating when the power goes out. Peak surge capability of 3000AW addresses the initial power surge when motors have a startup, such as the brief increase when a compressor on a refrigerator comes on.</p>



<p>Multiple output choices meet varied device charging demands all at once: The <strong>100W USB-C Power Delivery port charges laptops, tablets, and smartphones</strong> at full speed without the need for large AC adapters. Older devices work with<strong> the traditional USB-A ports, and the AC outlets</strong> take regular plugs for anything from cameras and drones to electric blankets.</p>
<p>The <strong>one-hour fast charging capability</strong> is a major improvement over earlier portable power stations that required eight hours or more to fully recharge. Using the included AC adapter, you can take the Explorer 1000 v2 from empty to full in about 60 minutes, which makes it practical to top up during lunch breaks or between activities.</p>
<p>For just $349, you’re getting professional-level portable power at half the cost. This Prime Big Deals night price goes away tonight.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[At Just 1 Cent per GB, WD 14TB External Hard Drive Is Practically Free Storage]]></title>
            <link>https://kotaku.com/this-14tb-external-hard-drive-selling-for-just-170-may-be-the-last-one-you-ever-need-to-buy-2000632682</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/at-just-1-cent-per-gb-wd-14tb-external-hard-drive-is-practically-free-storage.1319500/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Anyone of a certain age remembers being absolutely blown away when the first 100GB hard drives hit the market in the early 2000s. <em>So much space</em> — how could we possibly fill it? Today you would need several of those 100GB hard drives — 1,400 of them, to be precise — to equal the immense capacity of this <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4579/">Western Digital Elements 14TB external hard drive that’s selling on Amazon right now for just $170 in a killer Prime Day deal.</a></p>
<p>Care for a little more future shock? Those first 100GB external hard drives sold for around $275 when they were released in 2002. So the 14TB of storage space in this $170 Western Digital desktop drive would have cost you roughly $385,000 not <em>all</em> that long ago. Still wondering how good of a deal this one is?</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4579/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Huge, Fast, Safe</h2>
<p>All of that vast space on this WD Elements drive would be only minimally useful if the drive was slow — imagine how many days it would take to move 14 terabytes of data on or off of a pokey drive. But this one has a USB 3.0 interface (also works with USB 2.0) for speedy data transfers. It’s plug-and-play for Windows computers, and getting it ready for a Mac requires only a quick and simple formatting.</p>
<p>The drive itself isn’t pocket-sized like so many of the external hard drives we see today — it’s <em>fourteen terabytes</em> — so expectations should be modulated. But it’s a sleek-looking black device that resembles a book when standing on your desk at a modest 6.53 inches tall, 1.89 inches wide, and 5.31 inches deep. It does require an AC power source, but beyond that, the included USB cable is all you need.</p>



<h2>Who’s This For?</h2>
<p>Better question: Who <em>isn’t</em> this for? Reliable backup storage is a critical need for anyone who has sensitive or valuable files on their laptop or desktop, and that’s basically everyone who owns a computer. It’s beyond inadvisable to not have some form of backup system in place, and the WD Elements drive is almost certainly big enough to back up every single computer in your home. It’s especially valuable if you’ve converted irreplaceable files like family photos or home movies to video format and need to have a safe place to keep them.</p>
<p>When everything else seems to skyrocket in price over time thanks to inflation, it’s good to see something as valuable as digital storage go in the opposite direction. Even so, this Amazon Prime Day deal on the 14TB Western Digital Elements USB 3.0 external hard drive is borderline ridiculous. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4579/">At 39% off, it’s just $170 for more space than you’ll probably ever need.&nbsp;</a></p>
