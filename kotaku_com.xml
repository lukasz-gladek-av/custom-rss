              <p><i><span>2XKO</span></i><span>, Riot Games’ free-to-play </span><i><span>League of Legends</span></i><span> fighting game, released on PC, PS5 and Xbox Series consoles yesterday after roughly 18 months of closed beta tests. While it’s too early to comment on the overall quality of </span><i><span>2XKO’s</span></i><span> gameplay, PlayStation 5 players aren’t too impressed with its performance.</span></p> <p><span>After roughly 18 months of closed betas and “Alpha Lab” playtests, Riot Games has finally released its beginner-friendly, free-to-play (but microtransaction-heavy) fighting game </span><i><span>2XKO </span></i><span>in full. There’s no critical consensus regarding </span><i><span>2XKO</span></i><span> yet. At launch there aren’t even <a href="https://www.metacritic.com/game/2xko/">any reviews of the console version</a>.&nbsp; B</span><span>ut I sunk a couple of hours into it this morning and can confirm that it’s still just as good as it was during the last closed beta.</span></p>

 <p><span>Little caveat there: I played on PC. </span><i><span>2XKO </span></i><span>has technically been available on PC in early access since October 7, 2025, but only officially launched on Xbox Series S/X and PS5 on January 20. This is relevant because, according to the numerous posts that have popped up on the r/2XKO subreddit over the past 24 hours, the PS5 version of the game has a few performance-related issues.</span></p> <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">2XKO on PS5 might be the roughest I’ve ever seen a fighting game launch. Extreme screen tearing in fights, lags in matches and in lobbies, horrible monetization.</p> <p>There’s a great fighting game here but it’s dying by 1000 cuts. <a href="https://t.co/w4jT0pyN5m">pic.twitter.com/w4jT0pyN5m</a></p> <p>— reyna cervantes (@Jfcdoomblade) <a href="https://twitter.com/Jfcdoomblade/status/2013843486512947644?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 21, 2026</a></p></blockquote>  <p><span>As detailed in the most active PS5-related </span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/2XKO/comments/1qinnhu/game_runs_like_total_ass_on_the_ps5/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button"><span>thread</span></a><span> on the subreddit, titled “Game runs like total ass on the ps5,” PlayStation players have reported that they’re experiencing crashes, frequent FPS drops and, most commonly, heavy screen tearing.</span></p>

 <p><span>“I’m not having FPS drops (though I’m on PS5 Pro), but the screen tearing is horrendous,” writes user </span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/2XKO/comments/1qinnhu/comment/o0t6r6l/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button"><span>trugay</span></a><span>. “It’s the worst I’ve ever seen on a console title. It makes this a fairly disappointing release. I’m enjoying the game and its mechanics, but this is really dampening the experience.”</span></p>

 <p><span>Over on Twitter, user </span><a href="https://x.com/Jfcdoomblade/status/2013843486512947644"><span>Jfcdoomblade</span></a><span> uploaded a clip of the FPS drops in action and stated that “2XKO on PS5 might be the roughest I’ve ever seen a fighting game launch.”</span></p> <p><span>Oddly enough, I was unable to find any similar complaints from Xbox Series users. In fact, the only Xbox-related </span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/2XKO/comments/1qir40k/having_a_blast_on_xbox_so_fun/"><span>thread</span></a><span> I could find was from one user gushing about how much fun they’re having.</span></p> <p><span>It’s important to note here that the screen tearing issue can’t be properly replicated through recorded footage, as screen tearing occurs through the monitor used to display the image. PS5 owners have theorized that the screen tearing issue in </span><i><span>2XKO </span></i><span>may only occur when the game is played on a 120hz screen.</span></p>

 <p><span>If you’re confused as to why the same issue isn’t popping up for PC players who are using 120hz monitors, PS5 users have </span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/2XKO/comments/1qinnhu/comment/o0tfyys/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button"><span>further theorized</span></a><span> that this may be due to an issue with how v-sync has been implemented on the PlayStation 5 version of </span><i><span>2XKO</span></i><span>.</span></p>

              <p>The very first design for Pokémon mascot Pikachu was a delightfully chubby little fellow. Chunkachu, as it’s lovingly known, was Mitsuhiro Arita’s original drawing for the 1996 Japanese Pokémon card, and it gave the yellow mouse a lot more to love than he has in most modern renditions. To celebrate the 30th anniversary of <em>Pokémon</em> this year, Takara Tomy is releasing a proper chungus of a plushie in that original design.</p> <p>It’s going to be a very busy year for&nbsp;<em>Pokémon</em>. 2026 is the 30th anniversary of not only the release of the very first&nbsp;<em>Pokémon</em> games, Japan’s <em>Pocket Monsters </em><em>Red</em> and&nbsp;<em>Green</em> on February 27 of 1996, but also the very first Japanese <em>Pokémon TCG</em> cards with October 20, 1996’s 1st Starter &amp; Expansion Pack, meaning the celebrations are going to last the whole year. And that’s a very good excuse to remember how Pikachu used to look, both in the game and on the cards, before he got the Mounjaro.</p>

 <figure id="attachment_2000661887" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000661887"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000661887">© Tomy / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p>The new plush comes not from The Pokémon Company and isn’t available on its various Pokémon Center stores, but rather is being sold by toy giant <a href="https://takaratomymall.jp/shop/g/g8202602097181/">Takara Tomy</a>, and currently only in Japan. The extremely cuddle-able stuffed toy is 7,480 yen, or about $47, which isn’t too bad for a 40 cm tall cuddly. At the time of writing it’s sold out on Tomy’s site, though more expensive options for purchase still seem to pop up on <a href="https://www.amazon.co.jp/dp/B0GG8Y6125?th=1">Amazon’s Japanese site</a>.</p> <p>Chunkachu has been celebrated across the decades in <em>Pokémon</em>, not least with the design of the monster’s <a href="https://www.serebii.net/card/vmaxclimax/46.jpg">VMAX incarnation</a>, as well as <a href="https://www.serebii.net/card/25thanniversarycollection/1.jpg">updated versions of the original artwork</a> appearing during the 25th anniversary celebrations. But for the most part, the far more slimmed-down rendition of Pikachu is the recognizable emblem of the entire franchise. And fair enough—name a beloved cartoon character that didn’t look all kinds of weirdly different in their first form than the version we got used to. Oh my dear god, original Garfield.</p> <figure id="attachment_2000661873" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000661873"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000661873">© Jim Davis</figcaption></figure>
