This included the source code for the OG <em>Fallout</em>. Cain complied, which made it awkward when Interplay called a few years later asking if he had <em>Fallout’s </em>source code still. He thought it was a trap; turns out, Interplay had actually lost the code for it and <em>Fallout 2</em>. And <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/tim-cain-fallout-obsidian-lgbtq-pride-month-gay-history-1850501928&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/tim-cain-fallout-obsidian-lgbtq-pride-month-gay-history-1850501928">Cain</a></span> had assumed that due to Interplay’s “destroy it all” policy, the source code for the old RPGs were lost and destroyed. Thankfully, that’s not the case. </p><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.videogamer.com/news/fallout-1-fallout-2-source-code-isnt-actually-not-lost-reveals-former-interplay-founder/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.videogamer.com/news/fallout-1-fallout-2-source-code-isnt-actually-not-lost-reveals-former-interplay-founder/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">On May 5, <em>Videogamer </em>reported</a></span> that it had heard from Interplay founder and game designer Rebecca Heineman that she had the source code for both <em>Fallout </em>and its sequel, as well as many other Interplay classics. She started preserving every Interplay game after working on the studio’s <em>10 Year Anthology: Classic Collection </em>and realizing how poorly the company’s past work was being saved for the future. </p><p> “I made it a quest to snapshot everything and archive it on CD-ROMs,” Heineman explained. “When I left Interplay in 1995, I had copies of every game we did. No exceptions. When I did MacPlay, which existed beyond my tenure at Interplay, every game we ported, I snapshotted. It included <em>Fallout 1 </em>and <em>2.</em>” </p><p>Heineman confirmed to <em>Videogamer </em>that Cain’s comments about Interplay demanding all employees who leave the studio destroy all assets or face possible “litigation” in the future was true. She just didn’t follow those orders. And while she doesn’t have Caine’s lost and destroyed design docs and notes, she does have the source code for <em>Fallout </em>and <em>Fallout 2</em> safely secured on a high quality Blu-Ray disc.</p><p> “Interplay had a reputation of threatening ex-employees with litigation if they were ‘poached’, and if they had assets taken home,” she told the outlet. “However, they had no legal leg to stand on which was why a suit was never filed on anyone. [If] they did have a legal leg to stand on, I would have been sued into last week.”</p><p>As for why Heineman hasn’t released the code to the internet, she says that could only happen with permission from Bethesda (now the owners of <em>Fallout</em>) as they are still selling <em>Fallout </em>and <em>Fallout 2</em> today. </p><p>“I need expressed permission to release, despite the source code being pretty much obsolete,” said Heineman. “I [haven’t] gotten around to asking them. They are on my list.” She is a busy woman, working on bringing back MacPlay and porting more games to Mac. But hopefully, when she does ask, Bethesda is cool with her sharing these important pieces of game history online. </p><p> .<br></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

But now that they’ve confessed their feelings and decided to live a life of mutual domesticity with a kid on the way, the reaction has been somewhat mixed. Like most criticism laid at the show’s feet, it has to do with how showrunner Craig Mazin has chosen to change the storyline up for the show compared to the game on which it’s based.</p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="195618" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="Unboxing The Baldur’s Gate 3 Collector’s Edition" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="376" data-playlist="195618,197551,197550" data-current="195618"><div><p>Unboxing The Baldur’s Gate 3 Collector’s Edition</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195618/195618_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195618/195618_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195618/195618_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195618/195618_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/21110.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>In <em>The Last of Us Part II</em>, Dina and Ellie’s relationship begins in much happier circumstances. This is before <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/last-of-us-hbo-max-show-joel-death-abby-kills-reaction-1851777068&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/last-of-us-hbo-max-show-joel-death-abby-kills-reaction-1851777068">Joel’s death at the hands of Abby</a></span>, and so it’s not heightened by the explosive life-or-death circumstances seen in the show. The two’s budding romance is pretty much conflict-free for the first several hours of the game. Dina is a ride-or-die, ready to help Ellie cross state lines for her revenge tour in Seattle, and most of their time together on the first day in the city is about getting to know each other better in this new romantic context. The first time there’s real tension between the girls is when Dina reveals that she is pregnant with her ex-boyfriend Jesse’s baby. By this point, they’ve been traveling for weeks to reach the city, and Dina suspected she was pregnant for at least some of the trip. Ellie is furious at her for keeping this information from her, saying that they could have turned around and gotten her back home, going as far as to call her a “burden” in a fit of anger.</p><p>The two reconcile the next morning, but the scene illustrates how Ellie’s violent conquest is distorting everything else in her life. She’s concerned for Dina, but frustrated at how this development threatens to derail her revenge. Ellie comes off as boorish and dismissive of her girlfriend’s condition, and it stings hearing something so callous come out of her mouth in the heat of the moment. Compare that to the show’s take on this reveal:</p><p>Ellie is jazzed about being a parent in HBO’s version of the scene. Some fans similarly share the excitement of the mothers-to-be. Part of this is no doubt because viewers have been waiting for weeks for these two to seal the deal, but Ellie actor Bella Ramsey’s humorous “I’m gonna be a dad” line has become its own meme. It’s a sweet scene, and cuteness is enough to win over most people’s hearts.</p><p>But isn’t it all a little too perfect? That’s the argument some <em>Last of Us </em>fans are making, looking at the scenes side-by-side.</p><blockquote data-type="BlockQuote"><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.tiktok.com/@ackvvrman/video/7500789433646484766&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.tiktok.com/@ackvvrman/video/7500789433646484766" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">TikTok</a></span> user tambor wrote, “I’m trying real hard to defend the show and understand their choices, but why is Ellie so joyous after Joel’s death?”</p><p>“I know everybody’s gonna love this change because it’s funny, but them removing all of the conflict and relationship development and combining it into one happy-go-lucky fairytale moment is annoying,” TikTok user char said in the comments.</p><p>“I didn’t like this change [because] it was one of the stepping stones of Ellie losing herself to revenge,” TikTok user Invader wrote. “I hope they can still flesh this out correctly.”</p></blockquote><p>Part of me reads this as another example of the show being scared to let its leads be unlikeable. The adaptation has taken a lot of the thornier aspects of the original story out to endear viewers to characters like Abby and Joel. The second season was forthcoming with Abby’s motivations, seemingly in an effort to help viewers warm up to her after the <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/last-of-us-part-2-abby-laura-bailey-threats-grounded-1851222035&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/last-of-us-part-2-abby-laura-bailey-threats-grounded-1851222035">ludicrous backlash</a></span> toward her when <em>The Last of Us Part II </em>launched. The show also <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/last-of-us-tlou-hbo-show-finale-joel-lies-ellie-part-ii-1850209559&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/last-of-us-tlou-hbo-show-finale-joel-lies-ellie-part-ii-1850209559">bent over backwards to justify Joel’s violent actions</a></span> in season one, so this isn’t a recent tonal shift for HBO’s recreation. Ellie’s curt reaction to Dina’s pregnancy is hardly the most reprehensible thing she’ll do before she leaves Seattle, but if the show’s already pulling its punches on this, it doesn’t bode well for how down-and-dirty it’s going to be when things get much, much worse for our funky little lesbian.</p><p>If nothing else, the show needed a little bit of levity after the <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/last-of-us-tv-season-2-episode-joel-abby-death-reaction-1851777264&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/last-of-us-tv-season-2-episode-joel-abby-death-reaction-1851777264">brutal past couple of weeks</a></span>.
