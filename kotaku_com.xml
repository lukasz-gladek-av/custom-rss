Presumably, in this story, the crown-wearing elephant is supposed to be the mascot for the store, but given she doesn’t speak (as the characters of <em>A Way Out </em>characters do) it’s hard to know for sure. The only way the players can interact with Cutie is if one of the game’s two heroes, Zoe, uses her gravity whip to pull pieces from her body, yoinking off say her leg or ear, and throwing them around.</p><p>If you’ve never played <em>It Takes Two</em>, this probably seems like a pretty innocuous scene. You can pick up and throw plenty of things in this portion of the game, so why would an elephant mascot be any different? However, if you’re a fan of <em>It Takes Two</em>, you know this is a reference to one of the most surprisingly horrific moments in a mostly family-friendly game.</p><p>In <em>It Takes Two</em>, an estranged married couple’s daughter casts a magic spell, transforming her mother and father into toys. The pair, the game’s two protagonists, are convinced that if they can make their daughter cry the spell will be broken. To do this, they make the decision to destroy one of her favorite toys, an elephant queen named Cutie. The game revels in how uncomfortable this scene is to play. Cutie’s adorable voice gives her an air of innocence: she’s nothing but sweet to her killers before she realizes what they’re planning to do, and then her pleas for her life are painful to listen to. She’s torn apart in the scrap, including losing the ear and leg you can yank off in <em>Split Fiction</em>, and it all ends with you cruelly dropping her off the side of a bookshelf.</p><p>The scene is infamous for its drastic tone shift, shockingly requiring you to straight-up torture this child’s toy, listening to it beg for its life throughout. So you can imagine how seeing Cutie again in <em>Split Fiction </em>might be retraumatizing to longtime players of Hazelight’s co-op games.</p><p>Thanks, Hazelight for the collective trauma, I guess? At least the rest of <em>Split Fiction </em>is great to make up for it.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://kotaku.com/pokemon-tcg-pocket-grind-thanks-battle-trick-1851769030<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>If you’re fighting to stay on top of <em>Pokemon TCG Pocket</em>’s <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/pokemon-tcg-pocket-triumphant-light-arceus-leak-rank-1851766589&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-tcg-pocket-triumphant-light-arceus-leak-rank-1851766589">onslaught of card updates</a></span>, then you’ll know a simple “Thanks!” goes a long way. Up to five times a day, any player that presses the “Thanks” button after a battle or a Wonder Pick will grant the recipient a shiny new Shop Ticket to use. Collect enough Shop Tickets, and you can exchange them for valuable Trainer Cards (Professor Oak is the GOAT), Accessories, and perhaps most importantly, stacks of Hourglasses every month. You’re going to want as many packs as you can get for free, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/pokemon-tcg-pocket-free-player-spend-money-1851723336&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-tcg-pocket-free-player-spend-money-1851723336">especially if you’ve vowed to never spend money on the game</a></span>. But that’s still a lot of effort for scant rewards—so here’s a neat trick for speeding it all up.</p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="196165" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="What’s Coming Out Beyond Pokémon: The Indigo Disk | The Week In Games" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="95" data-playlist="196165,196663,197298" data-current="196165"><div><p>What’s Coming Out Beyond Pokémon: The Indigo Disk | The Week In Games</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196165/196165_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196165/196165_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196165/196165_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196165/196165_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/21711.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>You can almost completely circumvent that daily grind while still lapping up all the daily Shop Tickets you can, because the <em>Pokemon TCG Pocket </em>community has created a way to quickly and efficiently trade those “Thanks!” between each other. Months into the mobile game’s existence, this community-driven initiative is still going as strong as ever based on my testing. If you’d like to give and receive thanks while spending the least effort possible, say hello to your newest lifehack (lifehack is still a thing people say, right?).</p><h2 id="h1604408"><a id=""></a><strong>How the Thanks channel works in Pokemon TCG Pocket</strong></h2><p>Truthfully, this couldn’t be easier to participate in. All you have to do is…</p><p><strong>1:</strong> Go to the “Battle” menu.</p><p><strong>2: </strong>Select “Versus.”</p><p><strong>3:</strong> Select “Private Match.”</p><p><strong>4: </strong>Enter the password “<strong>THANKS</strong>”. As far as I can tell, this isn’t case sensitive. “Thanks” or “thanks” should also work.</p><p><strong>5:</strong> Press “Battle!” You should be matched with an opponent after a short wait. You may need to sit in the queue for longer if you’re playing at off-hours (like late at night), though in my testing I’ve quickly found opponents at any time of day.</p><p><strong>6:</strong> <strong>Once the battle has started, concede immediately</strong>. It doesn’t matter if you or your opponent does this, but both of you will (hopefully) be on the same page.</p><p><strong>7:</strong> Click through the results, and <strong>make sure to press “Thanks!” for the battle once you see the prompt</strong>. Your opponent should do the same.</p><p>That’s the process in its entirety! Just repeat until you get all the Shop Tickets you need, and make sure you use any stocked up booster packs or Wonder Picks so you can complete your daily missions. Because this channel specifically exists to quickly trade thanks, you should have more luck here than if you just conceded a bunch of random matches. Congrats on gaming your daily grind!</p><p>Do note, however, that this is a community-driven trick that is subject to change depending on how the game is updated in the future. In other words, your mileage with the thanks channel may vary. On a similar note, it bears repeating that <strong>you should make sure you press “Thanks!” whenever you finish a match in this channel</strong>. No, you’re not going to get sent to jail if you forget to press the button once or twice, but repeatedly taking advantage of the community is, to quote my Kindergarten teacher, not a nice way to play with others. Also, stop putting Lego in your mouth.</p><h2 id="h1604409"><a id=""></a><strong>But won’t this ruin competitive battling?</strong></h2><p>Well, this trick has been around for several months now, and Random Matches are still abundantly easy to find, so no. Also, Ranked Battles will come to the game by the end of March, so competitive players almost certainly have nothing to worry about here.</p><hr><p>In fact, if you fancy yourself a competitive player, I still suggest fitting in Random Matches when you can, just to see what cards are dominating the landscape. After all, practice makes perfect, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/pokemon-tcg-pocket-darkrai-ex-cyrus-guide-1851766515&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-tcg-pocket-darkrai-ex-cyrus-guide-1851766515">even if your Darkrai deck is still picking up wins left and right</a></span>. But if you’re about ready to go to sleep and don’t want to stare at your phone for another 45 minutes, then just enter into a Thanks battle and call it a day.</p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

But what if Aloy was also controlled by an AI program and could patiently chat with you during her adventures, answering all of your inane questions like “where can I find salmon bones to upgrade my pouches?” That’s the type of thing Sony appears to be experimenting with in a recently leaked GPT demo that teases one of the more horrifying possibilities for gaming’s future. </p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="196742" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="What Is Dragonsplague?

It was run on PC but apparently can work on PS5 as well.</p><p>Sony’s own internal Emotional Voice Synthesis (EVS) system is apparently used to generate Aloy’s voice responses, and its Mockingbird technology is used to crudely animate her lips. The result sounds cold and robotic and the  lip movements are somewhere between a bad dub and <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQr4Xklqzw8&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQr4Xklqzw8" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Will Smith eating spaghetti</a></span>. As far as a rough tech demo goes, however, it’s both silly and deeply chilling. “This is just a glimpse of what is possible,” Raghoebardajal said during the video which has since been removed by a copyright strike company representing Sony. </p><p>Sony’s experiment has already drawn heavy criticism from some fans and game developers on social media. “I was lead to feel very confident that Sony wouldn’t do anything like this lol,” wrote Alanah Pearce, who previously worked on narrative at Sony Santa Monica. “Finally saw the Aloy NPC and I have so many issues with it I don’t know where to start,” wrote ‪Anna Megill‬, a writer on the follow-up to <em>Cyberpunk 2077</em> at CD Projekt Red. “I’d rather speak to the heap of twisted limbs that Miyazaki called an insult to life itself.”</p><p>Companies have been exploring generative AI and large  language model (LLM) applications in gaming for years now.

It feels like we’re still a long way from those technologies dramatically upending gaming and everything else, as some of their biggest advocates claim they will, but it’s also not hard to see how that could happen at some point and how much that might suck.</p><p>Many video game performers, including Ashly Burch who voices Aloy in the <em>Horizon </em>games, have been <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/voice-actor-strike-sag-aftra-troy-baker-ai-cod-mw-3-1851604153&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/voice-actor-strike-sag-aftra-troy-baker-ai-cod-mw-3-1851604153">on strike for better AI protections</a></span> for over a year now. The fear is that companies will steamroll talent with bad contracts that let them do whatever they want with the performances captured, including feeding them into algorithms to fuel additional AI-generated performances for free. Actors would not only lose out on pay but creative control over which of their performances are used and how. </p><p>It can seem like a theoretical fear until you watch something like Sony’s own experimentation with an Aloy chatbot. It’s not hard to imagine a future in which, instead of a robotic Aloy fumbling her lips to answer basic questions about the game, it’s a near-perfectly-animated character ad-libbing responses in a voice indistinguishable from Burch’s. Instead of being an avatar for an authored story by other people, Aloy simply becomes another vessel keeping players engaged through endlessly convincing but completely empty conversations. </p><p>In that version of gaming’s future, the ultimately compelling version of the character is one aimed exclusively at boosting PlayStation player metrics like daily active users and session length. It might not be the type of game that wins awards but it could be the one, like algorithmic feeds on Instagram and TikTok, that keeps people endlessly logged on. You know, a kernel of the entire thing that went haywire and ruined the planet in the <em>Horizon</em> games, and which Aloy has spent hundreds of hours fighting to fix. </p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
