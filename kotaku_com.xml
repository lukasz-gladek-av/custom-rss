              <p>We’ve just entered the sixth year of the latest console generation. Can you believe it’s already been that long? The Xbox Series X/S are now fully matured. Their libraries are more robust than ever, full not just of cross-gen ports and sequels but brand-new series as well. How do the games measure up?</p> <p>While platform barriers are starting to come down and its getting harder to tell the consoles apart in many respects, the Xbox Series X/S still has a few remnants left of a unique identity. This list combines the nuances around exclusivity and first-party games with the great games that are playable on Xbox Series X/S whether they originated there or not. Simply put: if you just got your first Xbox Series X/S and haven’t already played these games before, what follows are the top “must plays” for the platform.</p>

 <p>Yes, the Xbox Series X and S are basically souped-up Xbox Ones, which means you’ll rarely be pressed for awesome games to play. A good rule of thumb is this: If it was playable on the Xbox One, it’s playable on the Xbox Series X and S. (To that end, <a href="https://kotaku.com/the-12-best-games-for-the-xbox-one-1500422046">here’s our list of the best games for the Xbox One</a>.) There’s also the matter of a little service called Game Pass.</p> <p>For $30 a month, you can also access Microsoft’s subscription library, including first-party exclusives and a rotating slew of third-party hits. (Hey, look, <a href="https://kotaku.com/the-12-best-games-on-xbox-game-pass-1841477023?_ga=2.146372340.1373133010.1689166215-2090935794.1654779924">here’s our list of the best games on Game Pass</a>.) With all that in mind, here are the best games for the Xbox Series X and the Xbox Series S.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/kpop-demon-hunters-best-worst-songs-soundtrack-ranking-2000616633"><i><span>KPop Demon Hunters</span></i><span>’ music</span></a><span> comes from the mind of Ejae, who also provides the singing voice for Rumi, the lead singer of the movie’s titular girl group. As such, there are demos for every song in the film with Ejae singing just about every part. This includes songs like “Your Idol,” which Rumi doesn’t perform at all in the finished film, so when we get to hear these demos, it’s like listening to an alternate version of the movie in which the girls of Huntr/x were the demons singing songs to capture the hearts and minds of the masses.</span></p> <p><span>Ejae has played snippets of the demo version of “Your Idol” before, but this is the first time we’ve heard this much of it. The singer/songwriter was </span><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bM2qmgJZPek"><span>part of an event</span></a><span> where she and co-songwriter Mark Sonnenblick talked about the making of </span><i><span>KPop Demon Hunters</span></i><span>’ soundtrack and played a couple of demos for the audience. This included the Grammy-nominated “Golden” and the original “Your Idol” recording, which has some different lyrics than those heard in the film. Even if it only includes the first verse, it’s really cool to hear Rumi’s voice singing a </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/kpop-demon-hunters-jinu-death-memorial-anime-expo-rumi-2000620346"><span>Saja Boys</span></a><span> song. I’d take an EP of the Saja Boys singing Huntr/x songs and vice versa, but I’d settle for full releases of Ejae’s original demos as bonus tracks.&nbsp;</span></p>

   <p><i><span>KPop Demon Hunters</span></i><span>’ soundtrack did get a Deluxe Edition release, but its new additions are mostly just acapella and instrumental tracks. If Taylor Swift can release dozens of versions of her albums, what’s the harm in Netflix and Sony putting out another version of the soundtrack that includes these old demos?</span></p> <p><span>For now, Ejae seems to be gearing up for her own solo debut after the success of the film. She released </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/kpop-demon-hunters-new-song-ejae-in-another-world-video-2000638832"><span>her first single, “In Another World,”</span></a><span> last month, and will hopefully be writing songs for the </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/kpop-demon-hunters-2-sequel-netflix-release-date-2029-2000641414"><span>upcoming </span><i><span>KPop Demon Hunters </span></i><span>sequel</span></a><span> in the near future.</span></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>If there’s one thing I really appreciate about <em>Deadpool VR</em>, out now exclusively on Quest 3 and Quest 3S virtual reality headsets, it’s how the first-person action-shooter lets you know right away what it is.</p> <p>The opening minutes of the game feature Neil Patrick Harris as Wade Wilson aka Deadpool, carrying out his wild plan to use a jeep filled with explosives to blast open a hole in a large aircraft taken over by an evil group of ninjas. If you like what this opening offers, the rest of the game only gets better. But if you can’t stand Deadpool or prefer VR games that feature interactivity, you’ll likely be ripping the headset off in minutes.</p> <h2>What is <em>Deadpool VR</em>?</h2> <p>Developed by Twisted Pixel and published by Meta, <em>Deadpool VR</em> is, as the name very clearly states, a virtual reality game in which you star as Deadpool as he gets sucked into a bonkers intergalactic reality show and quickly agrees to do evil villain Mojo’s bidding while getting as many viewers as possible. If he pulls it off, he’ll be a famous star. If he fails, he’ll be canceled, which in Mojo’s world equals death.</p>

  <p>Well, actually, to get to this part of the game, you’ll have to slog through the opening level set inside an occupied Shield helicarrier that Deadpool is being paid to rescue from the Hand Clan. And this part sucks, and is the worst bit of <em>Deadpool VR.</em> Prepare for a lot of dark grey corridors filled with the same enemies. And because Deadpool is very hard to kill, you rarely feel in danger in this section.</p>

 <p>The game is also very, very slow about offering up more ways to kill and interact with stuff during this elongated intro. So you spend a lot of time flailing your swords at baddies and watching them crumple in unsatisfying ways, or slowly walking around empty rooms. At one point, Deadpool himself pipes up to point out how dull the ship is and how easy the enemies are, and while it did make me chuckle, it didn’t change the fact that this part sucked a lot.</p>

 <h2>Swords are great, guns are bad</h2> <p>Thankfully, after a fun boss fight that combines all the tools you acquire during the intro, like a grappling hook and grenades, you are sucked into Mojo’s World. This is when the actual game starts. From here on out, <em>Deadpool VR</em> is about tracking down targets for Mojo, fighting lots of baddies as stylishly as possible to gain more viewers, and then using the cash you earn from your antics to buy new weapons and cosmetics.</p>

 <p>While combat in<em> Deadpool VR</em> isn’t groundbreaking for virtual games, it works well enough and has some solid mechanics. I especially liked being able to toss a gun at a bad guy, which reloads it and bounces it back to Deadpool. Fun stuff! I also liked being able to divekick stunned enemies to pop their heads off. Oh, and flinging Deadpool’s swords at enemies is wonderful. They fly with a lot of speed, autotarget just enough that you always feel cool doing it, and pin their targets to nearby walls.</p>

 <p>However, all the guns feel weak, and enemies don’t respond to hits in a way that feels satisfying. Picking up a shotgun, I was excited to blast fools away. But it doesn’t do that at all, and it often took more than one shot with it to take down people, who then didn’t go flying back in an explosion of blood. Boo! This is a <em>Deadpool</em> game, guns should blow people up and feel awesome and powerful.</p>

 <p>And you’ll get your fill of all the good and bad of <em>Deadpool VR’</em>s combat and then some because many fights go on way, way too long. At least during these bigger encounters, you can easily fill your special meter, letting you activate a special attack that uses various Marvel character weapons, like Gambit’s cards. During these sections, the game plays different licensed tracks, and I’ll admit I bobbed my head and smiled as I used playing cards charged with energy to slice down a dozen ninjas in a level set in Japan.</p> <h2>Shut the hell up, Deadpool</h2> <figure id="attachment_2000645535" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000645535"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000645535">©Marvel / Meta</figcaption></figure> <p>But throughout all of this, Neil Patrick Harris is voicing Deadpool, and it is a drag. He often sounds as if he walked into the booth and did one take while reading the script for the first time and called it a day. Often his voice sounds lifeless, his quips lack emotion, and he delivers jokes as well as a kid trying to explain why that one moment in the latest MrBeast video was so damn funny.</p> <p>What’s odd is that there are times when NPH actually delivers some genuinely funny lines with emotion and care. But they happen so infrequently that it makes me think he or whoever was in charge of directing his performance decided that for most of the game, Deadpool should be disconnected and nonchalant. It doesn’t work and just makes the few moments where he does come alive feel out of place. And the writing doesn’t help, with a lot of jokes and material being the kind of dialogue that would get cut from the first draft of a Ryan Reynolds-led <em>Deadpool</em> movie. I’d say the ratio of jokes that actually got a laugh out of me was about 1 in 5.</p>

 <p>I don’t even hate Deadpool! In fact, I really liked the last two movies and that Xbox-360-era game. If someone like me was struggling with some of the writing and with NPH’s performance, I’m not sure how people who truly despise Deadpool will handle playing <em>Deadpool VR.</em> Having your head strapped into a hot machine that screams Deadpool lines directly into your ear for hours might be like torture for them.<em> *shudders.*&nbsp;</em></p> <p>Ultimately, if you mostly like Deadpool, you own a Quest 3 or Quest 3S VR headset, and you don’t mind playing through levels that lack the interactivity seen in games like <em>Half-Life: Alyx</em>, I’d recommend <em>Deadpool VR</em>. But be prepared for a bleh intro, bad jokes, and performance hiccups that can make the game chug hard. I have a strong VR stomach and powered through these moments, but others might not make it without feeling sick. And if you hate Deadpool, well, you’ll probably feel sick for a whole other reason. So to Deadpool haters, I’d advise staying away from <em>Deadpool VR.</em> Doubt I needed to warn you anyway.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-legends-za-review-switch-2-bugs-performance-2000637719"><i><span>Pokémon Legends: Z-A</span></i><span>’s</span></a><span> new line of </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-mega-evolutions-best-worst-designs-legends-z-a-2000625459"><span>Mega Evolutions</span></a><span> has had both highs and lows. The Switch RPG’s wave of superpowered transformations has its fair share of undisputed bangers like Mega Drampa, who turns from its wise old dragon form into a younger, battle-ready one, and Delphox, who defies gravity while flying on a witch’s broom. Still, there are a handful, like the </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-legends-za-mega-starmie-jokes-memes-videos-art-2000638556"><span>long-legged Mega Starmie</span></a><span>, that have split the community. Another of those less widely beloved Megas is Feraligatr, one of the game’s starter Pokémon, though some fan artists have been creating their own interpretations that show the design isn’t beyond salvage; it just looks kind of dumb as it’s presented in-game.</span></p> <figure id="attachment_2000642463" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000642463"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000642463">© The Pokémon Company</figcaption></figure> <p><span>When Feraligatr mega evolves, it gains a large red dorsal fin on its back that, when combined with the new spikes on its arms, creates what resembles a giant Totodile mascot head. A lot of Mega Evolutions have elements of a Pokémon’s previous evolutions, like Mega Raichu’s fur reverting to Pikachu’s signature yellow or Mega Chimecho growing a massive Chingling-shaped ornament. Mega Feraligatr’s big Totodile head is one of the most extreme examples of a Mega Evolution following this design philosophy. However, it ends up looking absurd because the giant fin on Feraligatr’s back stays flipped open like a toilet lid.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><span>According to the Pokédex, this giant Totodile mask can bite down 10 times harder than Feraligatr’s actual jaw, so it makes sense that the water dragon would keep its fake jaw as extended as possible until it attacks. Poor guy runs around with this flapping fake jaw behind it, but as fan artists and animators have discovered, one small tweak actually improves the design significantly: just put the hood down.</span></p> <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">mega Feraligatr but the Totodile head doesn't flip back <a href="https://t.co/wLeCXyMCzh">pic.twitter.com/wLeCXyMCzh</a></p> <p>— doodlelotl (@Doodlelot) <a href="https://twitter.com/Doodlelot/status/1980380003952169372?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 20, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">making renders of Mega Feraligatr and it would be my favorite new design if it permanently leaned into the camouflage look like this instead of the toilet seat lid <a href="https://t.co/cotsIVL85C">pic.twitter.com/cotsIVL85C</a></p> <p>— Lewtwo (@Lewchube) <a href="https://twitter.com/Lewchube/status/1983534993638089104?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 29, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">Mega Feraligatr but it actually commits to the Totodile disguise <a href="https://t.co/eviPglsE9Y">https://t.co/eviPglsE9Y</a> <a href="https://t.co/TXlOHfRaLw">pic.twitter.com/TXlOHfRaLw</a></p> <p>— Yisuno ⚝ | MEGA ENJOYER (@TheYisusOne) <a href="https://twitter.com/TheYisusOne/status/1990072615533228531?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 16, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <p><span>No matter how you slice it, Mega Feraligatr’s design looks pretty silly, but it’s much easier to buy when it looks like the alligator is using the fake head as a type of camouflage rather than as if it’s&nbsp; sporting an unclosed toilet. Maybe when Mega Feraligatr appears in games and media outside of </span><i><span>Legends: Z-A</span></i><span>, The Pokémon Company will give it different idle animations that could help communicate the idea better than what we’ve got. For now, we’ve got fan artists who are singlehandedly turning folks around on the design.</span></p>
