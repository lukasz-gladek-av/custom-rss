            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><span>Remember that </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/across-the-spider-verse-spider-man-lego-teen-animate-14-1850506788"><span>scene in </span><i><span>Spider-Man</span></i><span>: </span><i><span>Across the Spider-Verse</span></i></a> <span>that showed a Lego version of Peter Parker living his best blocky life? If you didn’t know, that segment was animated entirely by then 14-year-old animator Preston Mutanga, who caught the filmmaker’s attention after he recreated the movie’s first trailer in the style of a Lego movie. It’s been two years, and the now 16-year-old Mutanga is still hard at work building scenes and trailers from Lego blocks. His recent projects include making the </span><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kaY7pJbYDy8"><i><span>Grand Theft Auto 6</span></i></a><span> and </span><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rl_VFCX_iaM"><i><span>Stranger Things</span></i></a><span> trailers look like something right out of a kid’s toy box, but it’s his latest incredible videos that have really caught my eye: faithful remakes of scenes from </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/kpop-demon-hunters-best-worst-songs-soundtrack-ranking-2000616633"><i><span>KPop Demon Hunters</span></i></a><span>, done in such spectacular fashion that they could have been an official collaboration between Sony, Netflix, and Lego.</span></p> <p><span>Mutanga has uploaded two videos featuring the Lego versions of Huntr/x to his TikTok account. One is a snippet of one of the coolest parts of the movie’s first musical number, “How It’s Done,” which shows the group skydiving down onto a blocky version of Seoul and kicking some demon booty on the way down.&nbsp;</span></p>   <p><span>The second is less action-packed but longer, and lets Mutanga add a cute nod to his </span><i><span>Spider-Man </span></i><span>roots. It’s a scene, maybe a third of the way into the movie, after the demonic Saja Boys boy band has started getting their flirty, sexy demon claws into the hearts and minds of the world. They’ve weakened the Honmoon barrier between the real and demon worlds, and the girls are trying to figure out what to do while maintaining their Kpop girl group cover. Their manager, Bobby, comes in to give them an update on their rivals’ newfound virality, and as he scrolls through videos of the Boys’ fans dancing to their hit song “Soda Pop,” a familiar webslinger briefly appears on his phone.</span></p>   <p><span>Mutanga’s incredible work speaks for itself, but I will say I sure hope someone over at Lego or Sony is ready to give this kid a job when he’s of age.&nbsp;</span></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>When, earlier this week, <a href="https://kotaku.com/gamescom-onl-2025-resident-evil-silent-hill-silksong-2000618460">Gamescom Opening Night Live</a> kicked off with the reveal of a new <a href="https://kotaku.com/the-first-five-minutes-of-bubsy-is-all-the-bubsy-we-nee-1749075286"><em>Bubsy</em></a> game, many online, myself included, went “Oh no…” as we shook our collective heads. But despite the last few <em>Bubsy</em> games being bad, it seems this new one,<em> Bubsy 4D</em>, might actually be…good? In fact, it might even be awesome. Really. Seriously.</p> <p>Back in the early ’90s, Bubsy starred in a handful of fairly <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bubsy#History">well-received 2D platformers</a>. But then in 1996, the <em>Bubsy</em> series made the leap to 3D, and everything went south. People hated <em>Bubsy 3D</em> and to this day, it is still called one of the worst platformers ever made. Then, in the last decade, we started getting new <em>Bubsy</em> games. They were also bad. <a href="https://youtu.be/PecXsy5-0yw"><em>Really</em> bad.</a> But now, a few years after Atari bought the franchise, <em>Bubsy 4D</em> is here, and it just might turn things around for the hopping feline.</p> <p><em>Bubsy 4D</em> is being made by <a href="https://www.fabraz.com/">Fabraz</a>, a renowned indie studio that has made a name for itself developing fun, innovative, and colorful 3D and 2D platformers that feel amazing to play, like <em>Demon Turf</em> and <em>Slime San</em>. And since announcing the game earlier this week at Gamescom, the studio has started releasing gameplay of <em>Bubsy 4D</em>, and it looks wonderful!</p>

 <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">Because a lot of people were curious: Here's me playing the same Bubsy 4D level without trying speedrun it. <a href="https://t.co/Xcm6mygpS8">pic.twitter.com/Xcm6mygpS8</a></p> <p>— Fabraz: Demon Tides ➡️ Gamescom (@Fabrazz) <a href="https://twitter.com/Fabrazz/status/1958646093031366982?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">August 21, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <p>In new gameplay shared from the Gamescom demo, we can see <em>Bubsy 4D</em> in action, and the game looks vibrant and slick. Movement and jumping look snappy, but there’s some weight to Bubsy, so it’s not too floaty. I’m also a fan of<a href="https://x.com/Fabrazz/status/1958190420598366399"> Bubsy’s personality in the videos released so far, too</a>. Another wild fact about this new <em>Bubsy</em> game: It contains fully voiced, 3D animated cutscenes.</p> <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">Fun fact, Bubsy 4D has fully voiced cutscenes cus' why not! <a href="https://t.co/DrL6A75f9x">pic.twitter.com/DrL6A75f9x</a></p> <p>— Fabraz: Demon Tides ➡️ Gamescom (@Fabrazz) <a href="https://twitter.com/Fabrazz/status/1958456027675795909?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">August 21, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <p>I can’t believe I’m saying this in the year of our lord 2025, but I’m very excited about a <em>Bubsy</em> game. Everything I’ve seen of Fabraz’s<em> Bubsy 4D</em> looks incredible. And people who have played the demo at Gamescom seem positive about how it plays and feels, which is only making me more excited for this sequel. <a href="https://x.com/Fabrazz/status/1958916894548803679">There’s also an outfit that blurs Bubsy’s private parts</a> and is a reference to Sonic. <a href="https://x.com/Fat_Bard/status/1958938923507306765">Even the game’s music sounds great!</a> So yeah, I want to play<em> Bubsy 4D</em> right now. But I can’t. Which makes me very sad. Damn you, Bubsy!</p> <p><em>Bubsy 4D</em> is set to launch on consoles and PC… eventually. <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3237970/Bubsy_4D/">You can wishlist it now on Steam.&nbsp;</a></p>

            <title><![CDATA[Peacemaker Season 2 Officially Removes Zack Snyder’s Justice League From The DCU]]></title>
            <link>https://kotaku.com/peacemaker-season-2-justice-league-gang-scene-reshoot-2000619550</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/peacemaker-season-2-officially-removes-zack-snyder%E2%80%99s-justice-league-from-the-dcu.1278486/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><span>John Cena has a brief cameo in this summer’s </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/superman-israel-palestine-woke-clark-kent-punk-rock-1851786212"><i><span>Superman</span></i></a><span> as Peacemaker, the foul-mouthed mercenary the wrestler-turned-actor has played since 2021’s </span><i><span>The Suicide Squad</span></i><span>. That movie was part of the old DC Comics shared universe (DCEU), so it seemed odd that Cena’s character would appear in James Gunn’s new take on Superman, considering he was, ostensibly, part of a different multiverse. Well, </span><i><span>Peacemaker</span></i><span>’s second season premiered last night, and through a reshot scene, has plucked the antihero from one universe into another without making a huge stink about it.</span></p> <p><span>In Peacemaker’s first season finale, Cena’s character met up with the Justice League from the previous film universe, including Jason Momoa’s Aquaman and Ezra Miller’s Flash. The rest of the team was mostly obscured in shadows and only seen as silhouettes, but Momoa and Miller’s presence makes it clear they’re likely accompanied by Henry Cavill’s version of Superman, who portrayed the superhero from 2013 to 2023. This ties Peacemaker to the old continuity, which again complicates Cena’s appearance in </span><i><span>Superman</span></i><span>.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>Season two’s premiere episode, “The Ties That Grind,” addresses this with an opening sequence called “Previously in the DCU,” which recaps the previous season with one major change. Rather than calling the Justice League for help as he did in the finale, this section is reshot and redubbed to instead show the Justice Gang featured in </span><i><span>Superman</span></i><span> arriving on the scene. Nathan Fillion and Isabela Merced reprise their roles as Guy Gardner and Hawkgirl, while silhouettes of Superman, Supergirl, and Mister Terrific are also shown but obscured in shadow, like in the original scene.</span></p>

 <p><iframe loading="lazy" title="Peacemaker Season 2 Replaces Justice League With Justice Gang!" width="422" height="750" src="about:blank" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen="" data-rocket-lazyload="fitvidscompatible" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/iAoxS56AJw4?feature=oembed"></iframe></p> <p><span>In a roundtable interview with outlets like </span><a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/peacemaker-season-2-how-james-gunns-dcu-addresses-that-season-1-justice-league-cameo"><i><span>IGN</span></i></a><span>, Gunn said that while fans might have expected a more convoluted multiversal explanation that pulled Peacemaker from one continuity to another, the director said he’d rather go with a simple approach.</span></p> <p><span>“Could I make it so that Peacemaker is the DCEU Peacemaker, even though he’s not really the DCEU Peacemaker, and he walks through that portal, and that’s where the DCEU Peacemaker is?” Gunn said. “I could have, but people are like, ‘How are normies going to understand it?’ And no, the answer is, normies don’t give a shit. Normies don’t care about all this canon stuff so intimately.”</span></p> <p><span>“It doesn’t matter if it’s not completely consistent in the past. So I thought the simple way was really the best, which is just saying, yeah, this world is a little different. We know there’s universes, and this is the universe in which everything was exactly the same as Season 1, except for the Justice League.”</span></p> <p><span>Some fans might be annoyed at the handwavey nature of this change, but it’s probably a good thing </span><i><span>Peacemaker </span></i><span>didn’t have to spend a whole episode throwing its hero through the multiverse to justify him showing up in future projects. Now it can just get back to what it actually wants to do rather than wasting all those precious, costly minutes of runtime, not to mention the precious time of us viewers. New episodes of </span><i><span>Peacemaker </span></i><span>premiere on HBO Max on Thursday nights at 9 p.m. Eastern.</span></p>
