              <p>Black Friday was weeks ago, but December is still Amazon’s busiest month for sales with new deals coming out every day. This <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6256/">Lenovo V15 G2 laptop is on sale for a record low of $599 instead of its usual price of $2,599</a> and you won’t find any discounts even close to this on Lenovo’s official site. This laptop has <strong>32GB of DDR4 RAM and a 1TB PCIe SSD</strong> which makes it a useful everyday machine that can handle work and entertainment without costing a lot of money.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6256/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Why This Memory Setup Makes a Big Difference</h2>
<p>In the budget laptop market where 8GB is still common and 16GB is a nice upgrade, the 32GB RAM capacity really stands out: This extra memory space lets you keep a lot of browser tabs open at the same time as Office apps, video conferencing software, photo editing tools, and background processes without them slowing down.</p>



<p>The 1TB PCIe SSD has enough space for large document libraries, photo collections, downloaded courses, and application installations without needing external drives or heavy cloud management.<strong> PCIe interface technology makes reading and writing much faster than older SATA SSDs</strong> which means that Windows boots up in seconds and apps start right away when you click on them. This storage capacity matters for students storing lecture recordings and project files, professionals managing client documents and presentations, or families sharing one laptop across multiple users with different needs.</p>
<p>The <strong>Intel Celeron N4500 processor is good enough for everyday computing tasks</strong> and uses little power, which is good for battery life when you’re in class or working away from an outlet. This dual-core chip has a 4MB cache and can boost speeds up to 2.8GHz and it has enough power for web browsing, editing documents, working with spreadsheets, streaming video, and making calls. The processor can’t handle video editing, 3D rendering, or modern gaming beyond simple games, but it can handle regular school and office tasks without too many delays.</p>
<p>The 15.6-inch FHD display at 1920×1080 resolution shows text crisply enough for extended document work without causing eye strain, and the anti-glare coating reduces reflections from overhead lighting or windows. The thin bezels make the most of the screen space in the chassis and gives it a modern look that doesn’t look cheap even though it is. Dolby Audio processing through two speakers makes video calls sound clear and YouTube and Netflix sound good enough.</p>



<p>Wi-Fi 6 support makes wireless connections faster and works better in networks that are crowded with a lot of devices trying to use the same bandwidth at the same time. This new standard makes it easier for multiple people to stream content, play games, and make video calls at the same time in dorms, offices, or homes. Bluetooth 5.2 works better with wireless devices like mice, keyboards, and headphones than older Bluetooth versions as it has a longer range and more stable connections. The selection of connections meets real-world needs with <strong>USB-A ports for older devices, USB-C ports for newer accessories, HDMI ports for external monitors</strong> or projectors, and an ethernet jack for wired connections when Wi-Fi isn’t available or reliable.</p>
<p>This huge discount off the normal listing price makes a well-configured laptop with lots of RAM and storage affordable while still keeping specs that would normally cost $800–900 elsewhere. You’re getting twice as much memory and storage as most other budget laptops, and the machine’s useful life will be longer than that of cheaper options because it has modern connectivity standards.</p>

              <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/nintendo-switch-2-metroid-prime-4-mario-120fps-perfomance-mode-2000650994"><em>Metroid Prime 4 Beyond</em></a> is more mature than your average Nintendo-published first-party game. So players were expecting some violence, sci-fi monsters, and guns. What they might not have been expecting was for so many of the puzzle game’s doors to look like, umm, well…</p> <p>As with past <em>Metroid</em> games from Nintendo, a lot of <a href="https://kotaku.com/heres-how-to-fix-metroid-prime-4s-silliest-control-decision-2000651021"><em>Prime 4</em>‘</a>s presentation is inspired by H.R. Giger’s designs from the classic sci-fi movie <em>Alien</em>. This is especially evident in <em>Metroid Prime 4</em>‘s first large level, <a href="https://kotaku.com/metroid-prime-4-impressions-first-level-volt-forge-titanfall-2-factory-2000650657">Volt Forge</a>, which contains a lot of Giger-esque architecture and environmental details. But other parts of <em>Prime 4</em>, like the famous artist, seem inspired by other parts of human anatomy, like vaginas. What I’m trying to say is there are a lot of doors in this game that might make your more prudish grandparents uncomfortable.</p>    <p>“Lotta vaginas in this game,” bluntly, but accurately, <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/aidanmoher.com/post/3m7733nyj4k2a">declared critic Aidan Moher on Bluesky</a>. And he’s right! In the early portions of <em>Prime 4</em>‘s campaign, you’ll encounter a few different doors that seem inspired by vulvas.&nbsp; Fans online are now sharing screenshots of doors that look very vaginal online.&nbsp; Some are large, and some are small. <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/mildlyvagina/comments/1pe7opb/the_doors_in_metroid_prime_4/">One of these doors</a> even popped up on a subreddit dedicated to highlighting objects and locations that look a bit like vaginas.</p>   <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">Why is all the discourse on Metroid Prime 4 about Miles and not how all the doors are extremely vaginal?

              <p>Netflix’s co-CEO, Ted Sarandos, doesn’t believe that the streaming giant is a negative force in the film industry. Instead, the soon-to-be owner of Warner Bros.&nbsp; believes Netflix is more of a savior.</p> <p>Netflix announced its <a href="https://kotaku.com/netflix-warner-bros-deal-batman-hbo-max-2000650875">$82 billion bid to gobble up Warner Bros</a>., the legendary film and media company, earlier today. If it clears regulatory hurdles, the deal will position the supreme ruler of streaming services as a God Emperor of a massive TV and film catalog, as well as the properties belonging to Warner Bros. Games, which include the Lego games, as well as DC adaptations like the <i>Arkham </i>series of <i>Batman</i> games, and the <i>Mortal Kombat</i> games.</p> <p>During an interview with <i>Time </i>magazine editor-in-chief Sam Jacobs <a href="https://variety.com/2025/film/news/netflix-ceo-ted-sarandos-movie-theaters-outdated-1236376565/">earlier this year</a>, Sarandos was asked point-blank: “Have you destroyed Hollywood?”</p> <p>“No,” Sarandos replied, “we’re saving Hollywood.”</p> <p>The CEO then casted doubt on the role of movie theaters moving forward. Though the streaming giant will need to premiere some films in theaters to be considered for certain awards, Sarandos doesn’t see the theater experience as something accessible for most folks. He said:</p>

 <blockquote><p>If you’re [fortunate enough to live in] Manhattan, and you can walk to a multiplex and see a movie, that’s fantastic. Most of the country cannot.</p></blockquote> <p>It’s a bit of an odd statement considering that cars exist. Still, Sarandos sees the industry’s reliance on theaters as an arbitrary limitation he’s happy to dispense with, much to the displeasure of Hollywood veterans <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-academy-awards-mean-nothing-to-me-if-they-dont-mean-theatrical-avatar-director-james-cameron-says-netflix-films-should-not-qualify-for-the-oscars-because-theyre-not-in-theaters">like <em>Avatar</em> creator James Cameron</a>.</p>

 <p>The industry remains concerned over the impact Netflix is likely to have should its purchase of Warner Bros. go through. <a href="https://kotaku.com/netflix-warner-bros-deal-batman-hbo-max-2000650875">According to <i>A Shot</i></a>, the Director’s Guild of America, led by director Christopher Nolan, is going to meet with the streaming company to address “major concerns.”</p>

 <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">The Directors Guild of America, led by president Christopher Nolan, plans to meet with Netflix to address major concerns regarding the streamer’s acquisition of Warner Bros. <a href="https://t.co/EcwdZ0A0Qz">pic.twitter.com/EcwdZ0A0Qz</a></p> <p>— A Shot (@ashotmagazine) <a href="https://twitter.com/ashotmagazine/status/1996978975311364261?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 5, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <p>Theaters have been in a bit of a bind ever since the global pandemic made it hard to convince people to leave their homes to go see a movie. Should Netflix’s Warner Bros. acquisition go through, it’s all the more likely that even fewer movies may hit the literal big screen.</p> <p>And with that, let’s <a href="https://youtu.be/wKiIroiCvZ0">reflect on some wise words</a> about experiencing movies from one of the all-time greats.</p>
