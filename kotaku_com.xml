              <p>Cary-Hiroyuki Tagawa was an actor that everyone would immediately recognize, but perhaps many would struggle to name. Known best for his portrayal of Shang Tsung in 1995’s ridiculous <em>Mortal Kombat</em> movie, and then for voicing the character in the games since 2013, Tagawa had multiple other defining roles across an extraordinary career. <a href="https://deadline.com/2025/12/cary-hiroyuki-tagawa-dead-mortal-kombat-actor-1236636368/"><em>Deadline</em> reports</a> he died on December 4, following complications from a stroke.</p> <p>It’s hard to think of a more iconic role than Shang Tsung, the evil sorcerer in Paul W.S. Anderson’s hokey and adored 1995 adaptation of the <em>Mortal Kombat</em> video game series, as well as 2013’s web series <em>Mortal Kombat: Legacy</em>&nbsp;(then once more in 2015’s <a href="https://lostmediawiki.com/Mortal_Kombat_X:_Generations_(lost_production_material_for_unreleased_web_series_based_on_game_franchise;_2015)">abandoned promotional web series, <em>Mortal Kombat X: Generations</em></a>). But Tagawa had broad range, known more recently for his leading role as the noble and conflicted Nobusuke Tagomi in Amazon’s <em>The Man in the High Castle</em>, as well as roles as diverse as Krull in Tim Burton’s <em>Planet of the Apes</em>, Hiroki Watanabe in&nbsp;<em>Lost in Space</em>, and multiple guest roles on a number of popular TV series. He also displayed a splendid lack of brand loyalty when he appeared in 2010’s atrocious movie version of <em>Tekken</em>! (As well as its straight-to-video sequel.)</p>

 <p>Tagawa was also a voice actor, portraying Valco in <em>Star Wars: Visions</em>, The Swordmaker in Netflix’s animation <em>Blue Eye Samurai</em>, and Alrich Wren in&nbsp;<em>Star Wars: Rebels</em>, among many others. He was a contributor to video game voice roles, too, again most notably reprising his role as Shang Tsung in various <em>Mortal Kombat</em> games, including&nbsp;<em>Mortal Kombat 11</em> and its various DLCs. The actor is also heard in <em>World of Warcraft: Legion</em>, and 2003’s <em>Batman: Rise of Sin Tzu</em> as the eponymous criminal. Oh, and rather brilliantly, he appeared in the extraordinary mess of 1997’s FMV game <em>Soldier Boyz</em>, a game that claimed to be co-directed by Darren Aronofsky, given the footage was lifted from an HBO TV show.</p> <p>The Toyko-born actor trained in martial arts as a child, before studying karate at university. His first movie appearance was Bernardo Bertolucci’s Oscar-winning <em>The Last Emperor </em>in 1987, before going on to appear in 150 other roles. Tagawa died on Thursday morning, surrounded by his family, aged 75. RIP.</p>

              <p>Upgrading your work or everyday laptop doesn’t have to break the bank; especially if you know where to look for one. Black Friday and Cyber Monday are over, but there’s still one last chance left to save big on a premium laptop, and bag some freebies with your purchase while you’re at it.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6240/">The 17.3-inch HP touchscreen laptop, which usually sits well over $2,600, is currently going for just $770 at Amazon, after a whopping 70% off its usual price.</a> It’s the lowest we have seen it drop to in a month, and the retailer is also throwing in a bunch of useful accessories for absolutely nothing. <a href="https://gizmodo.com/download/windows-11-pro">Windows 11 Pro</a> also comes pre-installed, so you’re saving a good chunk on that front, too. Be sure to grab yours fast, as we don’t expect the discount to stay around for long. In fact, it might not even make it into the weekend.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6240/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Massive Display, Fast Performance</h2>
<p>You’re getting a massive 17.3-inch Brightview HD+ touch display that brings content to life in stunning 1600 x 900 resolution. 1.4M pixels come together to deliver every detail with incredible accuracy, while the slim bezel and 16:9 aspect ratio offer quite a lot of room to work and play. You can stream your favorite shows, create presentations, and even play some of your favorite titles; all without feeling cramped. There’s an HP TrueVision 720p HD, paired with temporal noise reduction and an integrated dual array digital microphone for better video calls. Additionally, audio quality is just as great, thanks to the built-in Dual-stereo speakers.</p>
<p>For power, HP has packed the laptop with a 6-core AMD Ryzen 5 7530U Processor that is capable of hitting speeds up to 4.5 GHz. It’s more than enough to speed through a bunch of work and creative tasks without a hint of lag. The 16GB RAM isn’t massive, but still modest enough to keep things running smoothly, especially when you’re trying to multitask. You will be able to work with different applications at the same time – think catching up on Slack, hopping on a meeting with Zoom, working on a PowerPoint project – without slowing down. Storing all your important data in a single place is made easy with the built-in 512GB SSD. It should be enough for most users out there, unless you’re trying to store an entire gaming library on it. And since the storage is expandable, you always pair it with an SD card or an external hard drive to get the space you need. SSDs are also much faster than traditional drives, so you’re going to enjoy faster boot and load times as well.</p>



<p>The battery is solid, and HP Fast Charge gets it back up and running in no time when you’re running low. As for the freebies, you’ll get Windows 11 Pro pre-installed, a CD/DVD drive, a cleaning cloth, a wireless mouse, and a 256GB Micro SD. That’s everything you need to get started right away.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6240/">If you’ve been looking to grab a solid laptop without blowing your budget, this 17.3-inch HP touchscreen laptop is an excellent option to consider, especially at its current price</a>. You’re paying $770 for features that are usually reserved for high-end models. We recommend the machine to work professionals, students, creatives, and even casual users. Make sure you get your orders in quick, because the deal could expire at any moment now.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><span>December 4th is Dragon Age Day, the unofficial day fans of BioWare’s fantasy RPG anthology celebrate the series. Last year, the studio earnestly participated. </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/dragon-age-veilguard-4-review-dreadwolf-rook-action-rpg-1851681954"><i><span>Dragon Age: The Veilguard</span></i></a> <span>was only about a month old at the time, so BioWare </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/dragon-age-veilguard-character-creator-free-download-1851713224"><span>released the game’s incredible character creator for free</span></a><span> and </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/dragon-age-veilguard-popular-choice-stats-romance-1851713958"><span>broke down early player choices</span></a><span> on social media. This year? There wasn’t a peep from the studio on the matter. Not even a single mention of the franchise that once won “Best Game” at the Game Awards.</span></p> <p><span>If you look at BioWare’s </span><i><span>Dragon Age </span></i><span>social accounts, the last time the studio used the game’s </span><a href="https://x.com/dragonage"><span>X account</span></a><span> was to repost an ad for </span><i><span>The Veilguard</span></i><span> on the EA Play subscription service on August 28. The developer’s </span><a href="https://blog.bioware.com/"><span>official blog’s</span></a><span> last post was on November 7, celebrating </span><i><span>Mass Effect</span></i><span>’s equivalent “holiday,” N7 Day, which </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/mass-effect-5-n7-day-bioware-blog-teaser-url-krogan-2000642122"><span>had a small update on the upcoming fifth game</span></a><span> and the Amazon television series. You’ll find no such post about </span><i><span>Dragon Age</span></i><span>. BioWare has admitted it’s become a one-game studio after massive layoffs </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/mass-effect-5-bioware-dragon-age-veilguard-dlc-layoffs-1851750767"><span>back in January</span></a><span>, so there is no fifth </span><i><span>Dragon Age </span></i><span>game in the works, but the silence also casts a shadow on the RPG series’ past.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><span>If you’re only passively paying attention, it might make sense for the studio to not make a big deal about a series without a sequel it’s actively promoting. But for fans and the developers who spent decades working on </span><i><span>Dragon Age</span></i><span>, it’s another insult to beloved games that seemed to sometimes get the short end of the stick over their troubled development.</span></p>

 <p><span>In the months since BioWare was gutted of veteran talent and </span><i><span>Dragon Age: The Veilguard was </span></i><span>thrown under the bus by parent company Electronic Arts, developers have been candid about how the </span><i><span>Dragon Age </span></i><span>team felt like it </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/dragon-age-veilguard-anthem-mark-darrah-youtube-bioware-1851779569"><span>wasn’t treated fairly by the broader company</span></a><span>. </span><i><span>The Veilguard</span></i><span>’s messy production saw the game rebooted from a live service no one wanted into a single-player RPG that, miraculously, came out feeling like the character-driven epics BioWare is associated with despite being a decade in the works.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><span>After the game didn’t reach internal projections out of the gate, EA downsized BioWare and has focused the company exclusively on </span><i><span>Mass Effect</span></i><span>, and implied that </span><i><span>The Veilguard </span></i><span>may have reached a broader audience if it </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/dragon-age-veilguard-mass-effect-5-bioware-live-service-1851756169"><span>had stayed a live service game no one asked for</span></a><span>.</span></p>

 <p><span>So perhaps it’s for the best that BioWare didn’t acknowledge</span><i><span> Dragon Age </span></i><span>this year. If the company had even made a tweet or blog post expressing its love for the world of Thedas and pride in having brought it to life, the messaging would have come across as tone-deaf after the hell its team reportedly went through.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>At least this way, the fans and creatives who made these games get the day to themselves, without it being co-opted by a studio and publisher that treated them like second-class citizens. Now, </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/dragon-age-the-veilguard-bioware-layoffs-mass-effect-1851784416"><span>the </span><i><span>Dragon Age </span></i><span>team gets the final word</span></a><span>.</span></p>

            <guid>1374235</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>There are so many great games out there to play but so little space on the Nintendo Switch to download them all. The system’s built-in capacity fills up quickly, especially if you prefer digital purchases. Fortunately, expanding your available space is not only possible, but simple, affordable, and officially supported. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6239/">Samsung’s microSDXC memory card, designed specifically for the Nintendo Switch family of systems, is currently part of a limited-time sale at Amazon.</a> The 1TB model, normally priced at $122, has dropped to just $85, giving players a substantial 30% discount on one of the best storage upgrades available.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6239/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2 data-start="772" data-end="824">Support a Massive Library of Nintendo Switch Games</h2>
<p data-start="826" data-end="1187">If you’ve owned a Switch for a decent length of time, you’ve likely hit your storage limit. Even the Nintendo Switch OLED model, released in 2021, includes only 64GB of internal storage. The original 2017 Switch offers just 32GB, and with a portion of that dedicated to essential system files, you really have only about 25GB free for games.</p>
<p data-start="1189" data-end="1601">To put that into perspective, <em data-start="1219" data-end="1262">The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom</em> comes in just over 16GB. That’s a reasonable file size compared to blockbuster games on other platforms, but on a Switch, it takes up a significant chunk of your available storage all by itself. Two or three larger games can easily fill an entire console, forcing you to constantly delete and redownload titles as you want to revisit.</p>
<p data-start="1603" data-end="2132">This is why a large-capacity microSD card is almost mandatory. By adding the Samsung microSDXC card, you expand your Switch’s storage by up to 1TB. That’s more more than 30 times the internal space of the base model system. With that much room, you can download huge first-party adventures, tons of indie favorites, and even bulky third-party releases without worrying about shuffling files around. For most players, it’s enough space to last for years.</p>


<p data-start="2134" data-end="2704">The Samsung 1TB microSDXC card delivers read and write speeds of up to 180 MB/s, which is more than sufficient for the Nintendo Switch. It’s reliable, fast, and optimized for smooth performance while launching games or transferring data.</p>
<p data-start="2134" data-end="2704">And we haven’t even talked about the best part yet. This SD card has Shadow the Hedgehod on it. This whole lineup of Samsung microSDs features a Sonic character. The 128GB model is marked red with Knuckles, the 256GB one marked orange for Tails, and the 512GB card is accented blue with Sonic. And then at the full 1TB, we have the ultimate lifeform himself in black—Shadow the Hedgehog.</p>
<p data-start="2134" data-end="2704">It’s inherently very silly to me to put anything remarkable on the outside of a microSD card designed for the Nintendo Switch. That’s mainly because you’ll look at it once, pop it into your console, then never look at it again. I guess you can rest easy knowing Shadow is looking after your digital copies of <em>Super Mario RPG</em> and <em>Snipperclips</em>.</p>
<p data-start="2706" data-end="3132">Do note that this microSD card is&nbsp;<strong>not compatible</strong> with the newly released Nintendo Switch 2. The new console requires faster read and write speeds that you can find on an express microSD. This particular lineup of microSD cards are, however, still compatible on any of the first generation of Nintendo Switch consoles. This includes the Nintendo Switch, the Nintendo Switch Lite, and the Nintendo Switch OLED.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/metroid-prime-4-reviews-is-it-good-switch-2-nintendo-2000649621"><em>Metroid Prime 4</em></a> starts with a bang, but it didn’t really impress me much. However, everything changed once I reached the game’s first real playground, a Giger-esque otherworldly factory filled with robots, puzzles, electrical dangers, and a cool motorcycle.</p> <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/fans-who-pre-ordered-metroid-prime-4-six-years-ago-have-seen-their-entire-lives-change-2000645936">Nearly a decade after it was first teased</a> and 18 years after <em>Metroid Prime 3,</em> Retro and Nintendo have finally released <em>Metroid Prime 4: Beyond</em> for Switch and Switch 2. Over here at <em>Kotaku</em>, we didn’t get an early copy of the sci-fi action adventure FPS like many other sites. So I’ve been playing it today on Switch 2, taking my first power-suited steps into this latest entry in the beloved <em>Metroid Prime</em> series. Two things struck me right out of the gate while playing <em>Prime 4:</em> This game looks really nice. And the opening hour is meh.</p>

  <p><em>Metroid Prime 4</em> is a gorgeous game, even if <a href="https://kotaku.com/metroid-prime-4-beyond-graphics-comparison-switch-2-ugly-2000650585">some online don’t think it looks realistic or detailed enough</a>. What Retro has pulled off here is at times stunning and always runs at a flawless 120FPS at a crisp resolution, too. It might not be as sharp as something like <em>Black Ops 7</em> running on a PS5 Pro or as detailed as<em> Assassin’s Creed Shadows</em> on a Series X, but <em>Prime 4</em> nails it where it matters, using art style and smart graphical tricks to create something that looks wonderful on my big dumb 4K 120hz television.</p>

 <p>I especially love the lighting and <em>Prime 4</em>‘s HDR implementation, with dark areas not looking washed out and bright lights popping off the screen. It’s easily the best-looking Switch 2 game around.</p> <p>However, visuals weren’t enough to win me over during <em>Prime 4</em>‘s first hour. The game starts off with an action-packed tutorial and then a slow exploration of an alien world, where you meet a very annoying Galactic Federation soldier who, along with the game itself, practically holds Samus’ hand through most of the first part of <em>Prime 4</em>. It’s not bad, per se, but I wasn’t excited to play more. Thankfully, you ditch that annoying dude and set off to visit the game’s first real area, Volt Forge.</p>

 <figure id="attachment_2000650677" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000650677"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000650677">©Nintendo / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p>This is where <em>Prime 4</em> gets <em>really</em> good. I won’t spoil too much, as it’s an experience I don’t want to ruin for anyone. But what makes Volt Forge so excellent is how it blends everything great about <em>Metroid Prime</em> into one haunting and large level. There are boss fights that utilize your various tools and weapons. It has puzzles that feel just challenging enough that solving them is satisfying, but not so annoying as to be a brick wall. And some incredible music, too. And to my surprise, Volt Forge even gets a bit creepy at points. Don’t expect jump scares or worry that <em>Prime 4</em> is a horror game; it never goes that far, but I enjoyed the change in pace from the opening level.</p>

 <p>Maybe the most unexpected part of Volt Forge is that it reminds me of <em>Titanfall 2</em> and <a href="https://youtu.be/A2W0LfUXFQo?t=1740">that game’s much-praised level set inside a large factory</a>. Again, I won’t spoil exactly what happens in Volt Forge that reminded me of that level from Repsawn’s excellent sci-fi mech shooter, just know that the factory Samus is exploring is far from broken down. So you might want to be careful.</p> <p>And at the very end of Volt Forge, you unlock <em>Prime 4</em>‘s motorcycle, which handles fine enough and feels great to drive. I have no idea if the rest of the game will match Volt Forge’s quality or if I’ll enjoy the more open-ended hub desert where the motorcycle is primarily used. It’s possible that everything after this will be terrible. For now, though, <em>Metroid Prime 4: Beyond</em> was able to overcome its so-so opening hour and win me over with a creepy and dangerous trip through an alien factory.</p>

              <p>LEGOs are fun to build on your own, and even more enjoyable when doing it with friends. If you’re a fan of the galaxy far, far away or have a little one who just can’t seem to stop talking about the identity and origin of Supreme Leader Snoke, there’s a way to bring an important part of Star Wars to your living room this holiday season.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6238/">The LEGO Star Wars: Attack of the Clones Jango Fett’s Starshipset, which usually goes for around $70, just dropped to $56 at Amazon</a>. That’s after the retailer slashed 20% off its retail tag, making the purchase quite affordable. The offer can be grabbed by both Prime and non-Prime members.

<h2>Great for All Ages</h2>
<p>The set is made for ages 9 and up, and comes with a total of 707 pieces. It’s not massive, which is great if you’re planning to grab it for kids and don’t want to overwhelm them with a large project. It’s going to be one of those fun sets that can be brought to life by dedicating just a few hours during the weekend. Since the holiday season is upon us, everyone in the family can join in; maybe by the fireplace with some hot chocolate. Play the Star Wars theme song in the background to get in the feels!</p>
<p>You’ll be building Jango Fett (with dual blasters and jetpack), who is <em>a simple man trying to make his way in the universe</em>, young Boba Fett learning all about family trade, and tall Kaminoan Lama Su minifigures, plus the stunning starship. The attention to detail on the starship is incredible, since it features authentic rotating wings, four stud shooters, and a seismic charge-dropping function for some cool, explosive escapes just in the asteroid chase scene. There’s also an opening cockpit for two minifigures to jump in for some adventures across the Outer Rim, as well as a mobile service cart with ammunition storage. The latter doubles as a display stand.</p>



<p>Once built, the starship is going to measure over 3.5 in. (9 cm) high, 8 in. (21 cm) long, and 8.5 in. (21 cm) wide. It’s going to look stunning on its own, but you can always pair it with others in the LEGO Star Wars collection for a bigger setup that spans multiple star systems. The set also comes with a detailed instruction book that’s going to take younger fans through each step one by one. It’s quite easy to follow, so kids will be able to build on their own. For even more assistance, you can install the LEGO Builder app, which offers digital, 3D instructions. Kids can zoom in from every angle, track their progress, and save sets. The app also makes it easy to build with friends. In this mode, it divides tasks between everyone on board, so everyone can complete their own.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6238/">The current discount brings the price of the starship model to just $56. You’re saving a nice 20% on a set any Star Wars fan is going to love and cherish.</a> If you like it, don’t wait too long to grab it. Once the discount is gone, we can’t say whether it will be back anytime soon.</p>

              <p data-start="140" data-end="945">Laptops often get more praise than they deserve. While they’re convenient for mobility, nothing quite compares to a well-designed desk setup with large monitors, a responsive mechanical keyboard, and the comfort of a dedicated workspace. Such an environment not only boosts productivity but also creates a place you’ll genuinely enjoy returning to whenever it’s time to focus. One of the best ways to power a setup like this is with the Apple Mac Mini. Despite being a desktop machine, it’s still compact enough to take with you when needed. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4124/">Even better, the 2024 version of Apple’s compact desktop is currently discounted by 17% on Amazon, dropping the price from $599 to $499.</a> If you’ve been considering an upgrade, this is an ideal moment to treat yourself while saving a whole $100.</p>
<p data-start="947" data-end="1618">The discounted model is the 2024 Apple Mac Mini equipped with Apple’s M4 chip, which features a 10-core CPU and 10-core GPU. The device is sold in 256 GB and 512 GB variants, although the higher-capacity version is currently selling for over $700. Alongside that storage, the system includes 16 GB of RAM. The M4 processor is the star of the show here, giving this compact desktop a tremendous performance boost. Apple claims it can operate up to 13 times faster than the fastest Intel-based Mac Mini. That makes the machine suitable for everyday productivity as well as demanding creative tasks like photo or video editing.</p>

<p data-start="1620" data-end="2060">In terms of connectivity, the 2024 Mac Mini packs a generous selection of ports and wireless options. You’ll find three Thunderbolt 4 ports, two USB-C ports, HDMI, and Gigabit Ethernet, along with Wi-Fi 6E and Bluetooth 5.3 for fast and stable wireless connections. Apple may have phased out the headphone jack on the iPhone years ago, but it remains present on the Mac Mini, giving you the convenience of wired audio whenever you want it.</p>
<p data-start="2062" data-end="2748">The desktop comes loaded with macOS 15.1 Sequoia, which continues Apple’s emphasis on privacy and security. It includes an upgraded Secure Enclave to help safeguard your personal data and system integrity. MacOS supports a wide variety of software, from productivity essentials to creative tools. You can use the full Microsoft 365 suite, Adobe Creative Cloud applications, Zoom, and thousands of other programs. In fact, the App Store offers more than 15,000 apps, many of which are optimized specifically for the M4 chip.</p>


<h2>Better With Apple Accessories</h2>
<p data-start="2750" data-end="3035">To enhance your experience even further, you can pair the Mac Mini with other Apple accessories. It works seamlessly with the Apple Studio Display and integrates perfectly with peripherals like the Magic Keyboard with Touch ID, offering a smooth and cohesive setup across your devices.</p>
<p data-start="3037" data-end="3278"><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4124/">For a short time, Amazon is selling the 2024 Mac Mini with the M4 chip for $499, an even $100 reduction from its standard price.</a> AppleCare+ isn’t included, but you can add three years of coverage for a combined total of $588—that’s at a $120 discount.</p>
