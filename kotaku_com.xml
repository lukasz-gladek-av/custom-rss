            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>There are ways in which <a href="https://kotaku.com/hollow-knight-silksong-steam-review-bomb-chinese-translation-2000623496"><em>Hollow Knight: Silksong</em></a> can be a bit more difficult than its predecessor. For players new to the Metroidvania Soulslike series, it can feel a bit like taking a plunge in a cold lake: bracing but unpleasant. The game’s first boss fight is against the Bell Beast. If you’re feeling a bit daunted at first, the good news is that the giant arthropod is easy to defeat once you’ve got the pattern down.</p> <h2>Where do I find <em>Silksong</em>‘s first boss?</h2> <p>The Bell Beast is located early in the game in The Marrow. You can’t get to him until you unlock the Silk Spear ability next door in Mosshome. After getting it, there’s a silk obstacle in The Marrow you can cut through to unlock the way to the Bell Beast’s layer.</p>  <p>Glad you asked? While many <em>Silksong</em> players probably won’t have much trouble with this guy, this is a judgement-free zone with the sole goal of trying to help as many <em>Hollow Knight</em> players break through that first barrier and be able to continue their journey to the Citadel.</p>

 <p>The Bell Beast has two phases and four attacks. In the first phase he’ll just appear from underground and run across the screen or jump over your head. If he’s running across, you can jump over him and hit him 2-3 times from the back before he burrows back under. If he’s about to jump over you, just stand in the middle of the screen underneath the peak of the arc and hit him in the back again.</p> <figure id="attachment_2000624024" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000624024"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000624024">Team Cherry</figcaption></figure> <p>The second phase is where things get slightly trickier. First, he’ll come up from the ground and spawn two bells that roll across opposite sides of the screen. These are easy to enough to jump over and get a few hits in. Later, he’ll start shaking the whole cavern and have bells drop from the ceiling that bounce while he’s rotating through his other three attacks. Sometimes these bells bounce toward you. Sometimes they bounce away.</p>

 <p>If you stand close to where they drop, they’ll miss you completely no matter which direction they’re going. Plus they disappear before the second bounce. But watch out because during this phase he’ll also spawn bells each time he comes out of the ground.</p> <h2>He keeps killing me in three hits!</h2> <p>Brutal, right? Even though he’s <em>Silksong</em>‘s first boss, Bell Beast, like everything else in the game, hits pretty hard. That leaves little time to memorize his attack pattern and not much room for error once you do. The biggest general tip for the boss fight, like lots of encounters in <em>Silksong</em>, is just to stay calm. Don’t move around more than you have to and don’t overreact to flashy attacks.</p> <p>Imagine instead of a giant, harrowing roly-poly bug constantly trying to squash you, he’s just a rectangle-shaped hit box moving around the screen in very predictable ways. Save at a bench nearby, hit enough enemies to have a full roll of silk to bind with/heal yourself at the start of the fight, and then stick to dodging each of the four attacks as they come. You’ll get to the end of the fight thinking, “How is he still alive?” but then after a few more hits he’ll be liberated and become your new best friend.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/hollow-knight-silksong-steam-review-bomb-chinese-translation-2000623496"><i><span>Hollow Knight: Silksong</span></i></a><span> is a tough game. Its bosses hit hard, your early arsenal of abilities can feel quite limiting in combat encounters, and its volatile level design can send you accidentally tumbling down into a chasm and losing an hour of progress. But while these kinds of challenges were arguably all to be expected from a sequel to the challenging original, there’s one brand of platforming segment whose sheer difficulty is catching players off guard, especially if they miss an optional upgrade early on in the game.</span></p> <p><span>Hornet, the needle-wielding hero of </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/hollow-knight-silksong-how-long-completionist-achievement-2000623157"><i><span>Silksong</span></i></a><span>, starts off the game with a downward diagonal aerial strike that is used as both an anti-air attack as well as a platforming tool in sections where she must basically bounce on pods to get some verticality and reach higher areas of the map, using her needle as a pogo stick. By default, this attack has a diagonal slant that makes it difficult to precisely strike these pods and position yourself in an optimal way to reach the next one. Though there’s an available, optional upgrade that can make traversing this section much easier, many players miss it,, and because getting through these sections without it is hard but not impossible to pull off, a lot of fans think these are simply mandatory skill checks for your timing and positioning, and are uploading clips of themselves trying, failing, and crashing out.</span></p>       <p><span>The thing is, these sections don’t have to be </span><i><span>as </span></i><span>hard as some folks have been making them out to be, but </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/silksong-demo-hands-on-price-hollow-knight-pax-west-2000621695"><i><span>Silksong</span></i><span>’s non-linear nature</span></a><span> means not everyone is finding the upgrade that makes them significantly easier. Crests are equippable items you’ll find throughout </span><i><span>Silksong </span></i><span>that allow you to swap between different builds, and the Crest of the Wanderer swaps out Hornet’s diagonal air attack for a standard downward strike similar to the one the Knight can perform in the original </span><i><span>Hollow Knight</span></i><span>, allowing you to more easily and precisely pogo your way through these sections. Getting them isn’t an easy task, however, as you’ll have to unlock a few areas, abilities, and items to do so. Here’s </span><i><span>IGN</span></i><span>’s</span> <span>rundown of how to find the Crest of the Wanderer:</span></p>  <p><span>Keep in mind that this will also cut down the range on Hornet’s attacks, so you’ll have to get in closer in combat. Switching out crests is all about give and take, so it’s up to you to decide which perks and drawbacks are worth it to you. But if you, like many others, are tired of falling into lava and spike pits while you’re trying to pogo on these pods, now you know there is a better way.</span></p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/seagates-5tb-xbox-game-drive-costs-less-than-the-4tb-like-getting-1tb-free-3-year-rescue-included-2000623483</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/seagate%E2%80%99s-5tb-xbox-game-drive-costs-less-than-the-4tb-like-getting-1tb-free-3-year-rescue-included.1291506/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Game file sizes just keep growing bigger and bigger, but consoles struggle to keep up. Just look at the Xbox Series X|S. The more robust Series X has an internal SSD with storage totaling 1TB. With the Series S, you get about half that at 512GB. Not all of that is usable storage though as much of it is holding the system software needed for your Xbox to work in the first place. Then we have games come out like last year’s&nbsp;<em>Call of Duty Black Ops 6</em> with a file size in the triple digits. If you play more than three or four games, you’re going to be in a constant struggle of deleting and redownloading software as you bounce between games.</p>
<p>Luckily, their are external options. <strong>The Seagate Game Drive for Xbox comes with a crazy 5TB of storage</strong> to put all of your file size worries to bed.<a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3958/"> It normally goes for $150, but right now it’s 13% off which brings the price down to just $130.</a> You’ll save a good $20 (which just so happens to be exactly enough to hop into&nbsp;<em>Hollow Knight: Silksong</em>).</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3958/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>More Gaming Ahead</h2>
<p>Ok so here’s the catch. This is an HDD, not an SSD. Hard disk drives are notably slower than solid state drives. So much so that the Seagate game drive is incapable of playing Xbox Series X|S games directly from it. You’ll have to move the game file from the HDD to your Xbox’s internal storage in order to play it—sort of the digital version of taking your game disc off the shelf and popping it into the console.</p>
<p>Transferring the files can be much faster than redownloading from Microsoft’s servers otherwise would be, especially if you live in an area with unreliable bandwidth.</p>



<p>The good news is that if you’re still playing a bunch of Xbox One, Xbox 360, or original Xbox titles, they can be loaded and played directly from the drive. The drive is also compatible with Xbox One and Xbox 360 directly if tho9se consoles still get regular action in your place.</p>
<p>The HDD is portable as well. You can have your games loaded onto it, then take it over to a friend’s house. Pop it into their Xbox and you’ll be able to load up or move over your games onto their console. The drive is simple plug and play making it pretty straight forward to use.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3958/">Right now, you can save $20 on the Seagate Game Drive for Xbox for a limited time. Get it for just $130.</a></p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/elon-musk-favorite-game-deus-ex-conspiracy-2000624003</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/deus-ex-writer-says-the-fact-elon-musk-loves-it-is-its-%E2%80%98worst-legacy%E2%80%99.1291470/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Great fiction can’t fix bad people. That’s one takeaway from the fact that <a href="https://kotaku.com/elon-musk-grimes-cyberpunk-elden-ring-twitter-1850858252">Elon Musk seems to love</a> the classic sci-fi immersive sim <em>Deus Ex</em> despite it being a game precisely about how people like him are ruining the world. One of the game’s writers recently explained how that’s the worst part of its legacy.</p> <p>Released in 2000, <a href="https://kotaku.com/deus-ex-25-years-ion-storm-looking-glass-warren-ellis-1851784985"><em>Deus Ex</em> follows</a><a href="https://kotaku.com/deus-ex-25-years-ion-storm-looking-glass-warren-ellis-1851784985"> anti-terrorism operative JC Denton,</a> who uses his cybernetic enhancements to uncover the conspiratorial forces trying to take control of a world ravaged by social upheaval, economic collapse, and a plague. It’s both an investigation of how propaganda shapes society and what it means to be human, in addition to being a really clever stealth action game about hacking people’s private email.</p> <p>“That kind of political weight and social satire is a real common thread between <em>Deus Ex</em> and <em>Dishonored</em>,” Austin Grossman, who co-wrote the Warren Spector-directed hit with Sheldon Pacotti and Chris Todd, <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/fps/deus-exs-influence-on-elon-musk-may-be-its-longest-worst-legacy-says-its-writer/">recently told <em>PC Gamer</em></a>. “It is the thing that Elon Musk likes, creepily. It is creepily in Elon Musk’s worldview. So that may be its longest, worst legacy.”</p>

 <p>Musk has repeatedly called <em>Deus Ex</em> one of his <a href="https://x.com/elonmusk/status/1321245225755512832">favorite games ever</a>. When the pandemic began in early 2020, he even described it as feeling <a href="https://x.com/elonmusk/status/1241104391706304512?">like something from the game’s plot</a>. Musk also happens to be one of the world’s richest people, on track to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/09/05/business/elon-musk-tesla-pay-trillionaire.html">become the first trillionaire</a>, whose tech empire includes companies trying to implant devices <a href="https://www.npr.org/2024/01/30/1227850900/elon-musk-neuralink-implant-clinical-trial">directly into people’s brains</a>. Reading the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/deus-ex-at-20-the-oral-history-of-a-pivotal-pc-game">oral history of <em>Deus Ex</em>‘s creation</a>, there’s little doubt the <a href="https://kotaku.com/elon-musk-poe2-diablo-4-paid-boosting-fake-controversy-1851743670"><em>Diablo</em> cheater</a> would have been considered <a href="https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/are-we-the-baddies">one of the baddies</a> in its world.</p> <p>“It’s bizarre that Elon Musk would not recognize where he actually sits in the<em> Deus Ex</em> universe, because it is not in the JC Denton role,” Grossman said. “Musk plainly imagines he’s the JC Denton of this world—a plainspoken everyman, standing up to the elite. As is obvious to everyone, Musk is the one with power and he’s just pathologically incapable of honest introspection.”</p> <p>He continued, “I would say Musk is like a<em> Deus Ex</em> villain, except that the franchise doesn’t have any villains as whiny and self-servingly delusional as he’s shown himself to be.”</p>

              <p>How old is the TV in your living room? Is it absent of any smart features and streaming apps? Or maybe it is a smart TV, but you’re just not a fan of that particular manufacturer’s user interface (I’m looking at you LG with your wannabe Wiimote motion controls). You don’t need to be locked down to whatever your TV was capable of just out of the box. Pick up a Roku streaming stick for basically nothing and now you’ve got an intuitive, reliable way to stream content and navigate the apps. Usually, you can find<strong> the 2025 Roku Streaming Stick Plus with 4K and HDR support</strong> for $40. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3957/">However, right now Amazon is running a limited time deal that’s bringing its price down by 27% to just $29.</a></p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3957/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Jump Right In</h2>
<p>With a Roku streaming stick, you’ll have access to tons of different apps like Netflix, Hulu, and HBO Max (or whatever they’re deciding to call it this week). Customize the home screen to your preferences, putting the apps you use most frequently front and center. You’ll even be able to watch a good handful of Roku originals at absolutely no added cost. The service has shows like <em>Dinner Budget Showdown</em>,&nbsp;<em>Celebrity Family Food Battle</em>,&nbsp;<em>Martha Cooks</em>,&nbsp;<em>Emeril Cooks</em><em>,&nbsp;</em>and I’m sure a bunch of other stuff that aren’t cooking shows.</p>



<p>This streaming stick from Roku is capable of streaming content in 4K resolution and in HDR, so you won’t be sacrificing any image quality by making the jump from your 4K HDR TV’s interface to the more user-friendly Roku Plus. The streaming stick can even by synced up with your TV so it automatically turns on and off with one press. You can even control volume and navigate your Roku all with just the one remote. It even has a voice buttons which makes searching for your favorite TV shows or movies even easier. Just hold the button, say, “<em>My Cousin Vinny</em>,” and the next thing you know, you’ll be watching Marisa Tomei bang her foot on the ground as her biological clock ticks <em>like this</em>.</p>
<p>The Roku Streaming Stick Plus is designed to be unobtrusive. It’s compact form factor doesn’t block any other neighboring HDMI inputs. It’s powered by USB-A so you can just plug that end of it right back into your TV to run it. The whole thing will stay out of sight and you’ll avoid and extra cable running out, adding to the clutter.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3957/">Right now, you can grab the Roku Streaming Stick Plus for nearly 30% off for a limited time.</a></p>
