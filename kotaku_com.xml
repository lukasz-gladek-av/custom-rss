In those articles, it was revealed that Facebook permitted certain accounts to bypass company policies, dragged its feet in dealing with human trafficking networks on the platform, and ignored its own internal research into the harm Instagram was doing to teens’ mental health. Since the first <em>Social Network</em> created Oscar-worthy drama out of the Winklevoss twins suing Zuckerberg for allegedly stealing their idea—and the Facebook head honcho being a dick to co-founder and former friend Eduardo Saverin—this follow-up will surely have more than enough material to remind us how deleterious the company has been to the world at large.</p><p>It’s important to note that while the film is titled <em>The Social Network Part II</em>, sources told <em>Deadline</em> the movie will not be a direct sequel to the original film. There hasn’t even been any confirmation of Eisenberg returning to reprise his role as Zuckerberg, or that any of the original cast members will appear. What is reported is that the film will touch on Facebook’s influence on the 2020 U.S. presidential election.
