It takes inspiration from Blizzard’s game in plenty of ways, from general game modes to its style of monetization. Another way it takes inspiration is in its characters.</p><p>Some hero abilities in <em>Marvel Rivals</em> are clearly taken right from <em>Overwatch </em>characters. Many characters are pretty conceptually similar as well. For instance, Hulk comes to mind as a very similar concept to D. Va, both heroes have a “transformation” to make them immensely more powerful. That can be useful to keep in mind if you’re coming into <em>Rivals</em> fresh from <em>Overwatch</em> and want to roll with characters that feel familiar. </p><p><br>Luckily for you, we’ve put together a collection of five  characters so similar to <em>Overwatch </em>characters that many will find themselves right at home when jumping in. <br></p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="37c379b421ddaefada7bc64cdc0fbf8a" data-recommend-id="image://37c379b421ddaefada7bc64cdc0fbf8a" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="720" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Widowmaker and Black Widow are juxtaposed together." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Widowmaker and Black Widow are juxtaposed together." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Blizzard / Marvel Games / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="37c379b421ddaefada7bc64cdc0fbf8a" data-recommend-id="image://37c379b421ddaefada7bc64cdc0fbf8a" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="720" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Widowmaker and Black Widow are juxtaposed together." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Yes, if you can believe it, the two characters with “Widow” in their name play incredibly similar. Black Widow’s sniper will be incredibly familiar to Widowmaker veterans, and she has a movement ability to help get her into the perfect sniper position. Their close-quarters combat varies a bit, and they have different Ultimates, but Black Widow is an easy main for former Widowmaker players.</p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="4fb0fbcd7b18aa84f34a15c5883ce65a" data-recommend-id="image://4fb0fbcd7b18aa84f34a15c5883ce65a" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="720" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Hanzo and Hawkeye are juxtaposed together." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Hanzo and Hawkeye are juxtaposed together." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Blizzard / Marvel Games / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="4fb0fbcd7b18aa84f34a15c5883ce65a" data-recommend-id="image://4fb0fbcd7b18aa84f34a15c5883ce65a" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="720" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Hanzo and Hawkeye are juxtaposed together." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Another obvious Avengers parallel, Hawkeye and Hanzo are natural counterparts. Their abilities differ a bit, though. Hawkeye’s slashing abilities are unique to his kit, and his Ultimate is something completely new. However, the similarity in their main bow and arrow shots is undeniable. Hanzo mains should absolutely be running to try Hawkeye as their first character in <em>Marvel Rivals</em>.</p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="680a98443b5a6fb2c8c7c9b7418144e6" data-recommend-id="image://680a98443b5a6fb2c8c7c9b7418144e6" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="720" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Junkrat and Squirrel Girl are juxtaposed together." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Junkrat and Squirrel Girl are juxtaposed together." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Blizzard / Marvel Games / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="680a98443b5a6fb2c8c7c9b7418144e6" data-recommend-id="image://680a98443b5a6fb2c8c7c9b7418144e6" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="720" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Junkrat and Squirrel Girl are juxtaposed together." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Squirrel Girl is already proving to be a force to be reckoned with in <em>Marvel Rivals</em>, just like her very similar counterpart, Junkrat. Squirrel Girl’s primary fire grenade launcher is similar to Junkrat’s. And the similarities go far beyond the main weapon. She has a traversal ability to bounce on her tail to give her extra height, not too dissimilar from Junkrat. In addition, her secondary fire helps stun people. While it’s more active than Junkrat’s Steel Trap, these two abilities work in much the same way. Overall, Junkrat fans may find a lot of muscle memory transfers over to Squirrel Girl.</p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="1016d60f24097e92d2cec965a43f1aa3" data-recommend-id="image://1016d60f24097e92d2cec965a43f1aa3" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="720" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Winston and Venom are juxtaposed together." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Winston and Venom are juxtaposed together." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Blizzard / Marvel Games / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="1016d60f24097e92d2cec965a43f1aa3" data-recommend-id="image://1016d60f24097e92d2cec965a43f1aa3" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="720" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Winston and Venom are juxtaposed together." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Winston is a tank that <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/the-problem-with-overwatchs-dive-meta-1796828151&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/the-problem-with-overwatchs-dive-meta-1796828151">dominated <em>Overwatch</em>’s infamous dive meta</a></span>, and Venom has a lot of similar shades. Both are tanks that rely on leaping headfirst into trouble. Once they’re in the enemy backlines, their primary attacks are both short range “beams” that don’t do heavy damage but can really add up over time. Venom’s other abilities are more focused on self-sustaining than providing specific cover for teammates, but if you played Winston in <em>Overwatch</em>, a switch from the simian to the symbiote may be in order for you.</p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="f60c3bf9239ab582c8ad72ed762fd3fe" data-recommend-id="image://f60c3bf9239ab582c8ad72ed762fd3fe" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="720" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Baptiste and Rocket Raccoon are juxtaposed next to each other." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Baptiste and Rocket Raccoon are juxtaposed next to each other." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Blizzard / Marvel Games / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="f60c3bf9239ab582c8ad72ed762fd3fe" data-recommend-id="image://f60c3bf9239ab582c8ad72ed762fd3fe" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="720" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Baptiste and Rocket Raccoon are juxtaposed next to each other." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Rocket Raccoon plays like a much simpler version of <em>Overwatch</em>’s high-flying support, Baptiste. Like Baptiste, Rocket fires healing grenades with a secondary fire, and uses a traditional ballistic weapon as their primary. They also have a powerful ability that requires a lot of trigger discipline: Immortality Beacon for Baptiste, and the B.R.B. for Rocket. Finally, both have a damage-boosting Ultimate ability. While Baptiste’s is a screen, Rocket’s shoots damage boosting beams surrounding his device.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Outside some brief mentions in-game, the most information I can find on it was just a bunch of players in the official Discord asking questions and occasionally getting an evaluated guess of an answer from a fellow player. But after some rigorous testing and cross-references with other materials, I’ve put together a handy breakdown of everything you need to know about Season Bonuses.</p><h2 id="h8277"><a id="whatis"></a>What is a Season Bonus?</h2><p><strong>Season Bonuses are class-specific buffs provided to a set of characters: </strong></p><ul data-type="List" data-style="Bullet"><li><strong>Vanguards get extra health </strong></li><li><strong>Duelists get a damage boost </strong></li><li><strong>Strategists get a healing bonus</strong>&nbsp;</li></ul><p>Each of the characters receiving these bonuses is involved in Team-Up Abilities. More specifically, each one serves as an anchor or initiator for them.</p><p>We’re assuming that this isn’t just a massive coincidence and the characters mentioned above were chosen for their Team-Ups role. The yellow symbol for Season Bonus is also used to infer to Team-Up Anchors after all. Adjusting these bonuses could be a way to motivate players to use these characters, or perhaps be a method of balancing on the developer’s part. Something that ties into both of those is the presumption that Season Bonuses will only last throughout the season. </p><p>The next season could adjust the values of these bonuses or provide them to entirely different characters. If these are indeed meant to be tied to Team-Ups, we could also see the debut of new ones and potentially the shelving of others. Again, we can only make guesses about Season Bonuses since we don’t have a proper explanation. Fingers crossed we have a detailed breakdown come time for Season One.</p><h2 id="h8278"><a id="activate"></a>How to activate a Season Bonus</h2><figure id="" data-id="522818f18a5795f8d58c6ce1dcd161aa" data-recommend-id="image://522818f18a5795f8d58c6ce1dcd161aa" data-format="jpg" data-width="3840" data-height="2160" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The Hero Profile page for Groot, shows his Team-Up Anchor Season Bonus in the bottom left." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="The Hero Profile page for Groot, shows his Team-Up Anchor Season Bonus in the bottom left." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Marvel Games / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="522818f18a5795f8d58c6ce1dcd161aa" data-recommend-id="image://522818f18a5795f8d58c6ce1dcd161aa" data-format="jpg" data-width="3840" data-height="2160" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The Hero Profile page for Groot, shows his Team-Up Anchor Season Bonus in the bottom left." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>There is a good chance that the first time you saw mention of a Season Bonus was while you were picking a hero to play.
