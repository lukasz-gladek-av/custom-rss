              <p>Good morning, or good afternoon, or good whenever you are reading this. <em>Kotaku’s</em> Morning Checkpoint is back once more to share some news and other stuff with you. Today, that includes a wild story about a gaming convention gone wrong, more information on maps in <em>Battlefield 6</em>, a new union at Blizzard, a look behind the scenes on <em>Superman</em>, and an interview with the madman who hosts Dropout’s <em>Game Changer.&nbsp;</em></p> <h2>A gaming convention in Tampa, Florida was a complete shitshow</h2> <p>The National Gaming Expo, held last week, sounds like it was a horrible and mostly empty experience, according to a new <em>IGN</em> report. According to many who attended, the convention was poorly managed, had very little to offer, and inside the convention center were animals to pet instead of new games to play. Seriously. <em>IGN</em> reports that fans paid $40 for a single-day ticket or $90 for the weekend, and now everyone wants their money back. Also, the guy allegedly in charge of running the whole event has a history of putting on crappy conventions and recently got out of prison in the Dominican Republic. <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/gta-actor-says-disastrous-florida-gaming-convention-put-the-con-in-comic-con">You should read the full report because it’s truly a wild story.</a></p> <h2><em>Battlefield 6</em> dev says bigger maps are included in the full game</h2> <p>The lead producer on <em>Battlefield 6,&nbsp;</em>David Sirland, <a href="https://x.com/tiggr_/status/1954994293934055475?">replied to a fan</a> complaining that the maps featured in the recent beta were too small and confirmed that the game contains bigger maps beyond what was featured in the playtest.</p> <p>“Speed is a factor of map size,” said Sirland on Twitter. “We picked these maps to make sure we hit the full-octane version of <em>Battlefield</em> on the head – and made everyone see we can handle that too. Large maps exist, and the tempo scales accordingly; you’ll be able to see soon enough!” The <em>BF6</em> beta returns August 14 for one final weekend.</p> <h2>Over 900 Blizzard developers are now unionized A new version of the <em>GTA: The Trilogy</em> arrives on Switch</h2> <div role="listitem" data-qa="virtual-list-item" data-qa-unprocessed="false" data-qa-placeholder="false" id="message-list_1755093591.754199" tabindex="0" aria-setsize="-1" data-item-key="1755093591.754199"> <div role="document" aria-roledescription="message" data-qa-hover="true"> <div dir="auto" data-qa="message_content" role="presentation"> <p>Blizzard’s Story and Franchise Development team is the latest part of the company to form a union. <a href="https://cwa-union.org/news/releases/blizzards-story-and-franchise-development-workers-form-latest-video-game-union#:~:text=These%20workers%20will%20be%20the,industry%20after%20Microsoft%20acquired%20Activision">According to a press release</a> from the Communication Workers of America (CWA), Blizzard’s in-house cutscene creators voted “strongly in favor of union representation” with the CWA. Parent company Microsoft has already recognized the union. These devs join over 3,000 unionized workers at Microsoft-owned studios, <a href="https://kotaku.com/overwatch-2-blizzard-team-4-union-microsoft-1851779922">which include the <em>Overwatch 2</em> development team</a>, as well as groups within Zenimax and Raven Software.</p> <h2><em>Stalker 2</em> is upgrading to a new version of Unreal Engine 5</h2> </div> <p>On August 12, <em>Stalker 2</em> developers GSC Game World announced plans to update their popular post-apocalyptic open-world shooter to a newer version of Unreal Engine 5, which should help the game run better and be more stable on more PCs.</p> <p>“Our main mission in the near future is upgrading the game to Unreal Engine 5.5.4,” <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1643320/view/525350789598676383?l=english">said the devs in a Steam post</a>. “This will bring new features and tools to make the Zone an even better place, but more importantly, bringing the latest Unreal Engine 5 optimizations will lead to better stability and performance.” Other changes mentioned in a new road map include tweaks to the game’s “A-life System,” new missions, a reworked stamina system, and new night vision devices.&nbsp; GSC is aiming to bring these changes to <em>Stalker 2</em> by the end of the year, but admits that upgrading to a new version of UE5 could cause some delay.</p> <h2>A new version of the <em>GTA: The Trilogy</em> arrives on Switch?</h2> <p>Rockstar Games may have quietly released a new version of its controversial <em>Grand Theft Auto</em> remaster collection for the Nintendo Switch. Previously, the collection required users to download <em>Vice City</em> and some updates for<em> GTA III</em> and <em>San Andreas</em>. Now, <a href="https://nintendoeverything.com/gta-the-trilogy-definitive-edition-nintendo-switch-physical-release/">however, people have spotted what could be a new physical version</a> of the <em>GTA Trilogy</em> that appears to lack any warnings on the front indicating you’ll need to download the games. However, until people actually get their hands on this supposedly new version, we won’t know for sure.</p> <h2>ICYMI:</h2> <ul> <li><a href="https://kotaku.com/game-changer-dropout-sam-reich-interview-season-7-comedy-design-2000617191">We interviewed Sam Reich, <em>Game Changer’</em>s host, about how the show creates its games</a></li> <li><a href="https://kotaku.com/aol-dial-up-shut-down-youve-got-mail-sound-internet-2000617225">AOL dial-up is ending, reminding you that, hey, AOL dial-up service was still a thing in 2025</a></li> <li><a href="https://kotaku.com/chuck-e-cheese-arcade-snow-day-stuck-fire-department-burbank-2000617154">A woman got her arm stuck in a machine at Chuck E.

To me, this is two people who care a lot about what they are making, who don’t agree on a point about it, and both are passionately trying to solve the problem. I love it. In a time when so many movies feel sterile, it’s nice to see some passion behind the camera.</p> </div> </div>

              <p>You can hardly log onto <a href="https://kotaku.com/playstation-live-service-concord-marathon-smoothly-2000616270">your PlayStation 5 or PS4</a> these days without seeing a banner for another massive 75 percent off sale. Sony’s latest discount event is pegged to Gamescom 2025, which kicks off next week, and it has some surprisingly decent deals. If you’ve been pining for a hundred hour RPG to whittle away the final days of summer, you’re in luck. A bunch of them are currently 50 percent off.</p> <p><a href="https://t.co/WRVXMm2mRb">The current Gamescom sale</a> is running through August 27 and, I’m guessing, will probably be refreshed after the expo gets underway, <a href="https://kotaku.com/gamescom-2024-e3-microsoft-gaming-show-1851638178">starting with Geoff Keighley’s Opening Night Live showcase</a> on August 19. In the meantime, here are the best RPG discounts that are currently part of the sale:</p> <ul> <li><em>Bloodborne</em>: $10 (50 percent off)</li> <li><em>Persona 5</em>: $10 (50 percent off)</li> <li><em>Monster Hunter Rise</em>: $10 (75 percent off)</li> <li><em>Chrono Cross: The Radical Dreamers</em>: $8 (60 percent off)</li> <li><em>Fell Seal: Arbiter’s Mark</em>: $7.50 (75 percent off)</li> <li><em>Valkyria Chronicles 4</em>: $10 (80 percent off)</li> <li><em>Final Fantasy XII: The Zodiac Age</em>: $20 (60 percent off)</li> <li><em>Tales of Arise</em>: $20 (50 percent off)</li> <li><em>Soul Hackers 2</em>: $15 (75 percent off)</li> <li><em>Grandia HD Collection</em>: $20 (50 percent off)</li> <li><em>Dungeon Encounters</em>: $12 (60 percent off)</li> <li><em>Unicorn Overlord</em>: $24 (60 percent off)</li> <li><em>Star Ocean: The Second Story R</em>: $25 (50 percent off)</li> <li><em>Persona 3 Reload</em>: $32 (55 percent off)</li> <li><em>Shin Megami Tensei V: Vengeance</em>: $27 (55 percent off)</li> </ul> <p>A couple of things to note for those picking through this list. Is <em>Bloodborne really</em> an RPG? It’s primarily an action game, sure, but you also fight things to level up your stats, so obviously yes. It’s an all-timer and deserves to be in everyone’s library, and this is about as cheap as it gets. Personally, I prefer <em>Persona 3 Reload</em> to <em>Persona 5</em>, though the latter is a bit more dense, fully-featured, and less grindy. <em>Final Fantasy XII</em> is one of my favorite late-night summertime hangs, and <em>The Zodiac Age</em> remaster is excellent. It’s structured very much like a single-player MMO, so you can mostly just run around exploring the beautiful world and its incredible soundtrack while your party does all the tedious auto-battling.</p> <p>Then there are some picks that are more borderline. I wasn’t impressed with the<em> Chrono Cross</em> remaster on the whole, <a href="https://kotaku.com/chono-cross-radical-dreamers-sale-discount-ps5-cheap-1851499822">but some updates improved things since it released</a> and at $8 it’s a perfectly good way to experience a PS1 classic with modern convenience features. <em>Fell Seal</em> is also a bit of an acquired taste. It’s one of many indie clones of <em>Final</em> <em>Fantasy Tactics</em> floating around out there, but arguably the strongest in terms of its deep, customizable job system and actually challenging combat. And at just $15, <em>Soul Hackers 2</em> is also a bargain. While not nearly as good as the rest of the Atlus RPGs on this list, there’s plenty of weird, old-school PS2 charm to admire in it. It’s a sequel to 1997’s <i>Devil Summoner: Soul Hackers</i> and, by God, does it play like it: Archaic, grindy, and repetitive. But if you want a meaty dungeon crawler with unique, stylish vibes, it hits just fine.</p>
