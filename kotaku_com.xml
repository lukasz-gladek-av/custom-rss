I called it one of the best games in the series and the best-looking open-world game I’ve ever played. Set in feudal Japan, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/ubisoft-assassins-creed-shadows-delay-march-february-1851736266&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/ubisoft-assassins-creed-shadows-delay-march-february-1851736266"><em>Shadows</em></a></span> quickly became the second best-selling game of the year so far. And now, after the dust has settled, Ubisoft has revealed a months-long roadmap that includes new features, quests, options, gear, and even big parkour improvements. </p><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.ubisoft.com/en-us/game/assassins-creed/news/3rJiU861lAyWTYpvH3cfmY/assassins-creed-shadows-post-launch-roadmap-update-a-first-look-at-whats-coming-next&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.ubisoft.com/en-us/game/assassins-creed/news/3rJiU861lAyWTYpvH3cfmY/assassins-creed-shadows-post-launch-roadmap-update-a-first-look-at-whats-coming-next" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">On Wednesday</a></span>, Ubisoft published a short video detailing all the upcoming content and updates planned for <em>Assassin’s Creed Shadows. </em>Most of the updates will be completely free, including a planned series of regular “Story Drops” that will add new quests, abilities, and activities while also providing more backstory for fan-favorite side characters. The first one lands in early May. </p><p>For fans of doing sick parkour leaps across buildings and up walls, Ubisoft is improving your parkour toolbox in a later May update that will add height-gaining back-ejects, fully re-animated height-gaining side-ejects, and a completely new parkour move called the Vertical Ledge Jump. This last one will let both characters jump straight up to grab low overhangs without needing a wall. Ubisoft also promises that “more little parkour tricks and improvements” will be added throughout 2025.</p><p>Another part of <em> Shadows’ </em>roadmap is a series of community-focused updates adding content and options based directly on player feedback, including the ability to toggle different in-game filters on and off as well as certain visual effects and character headgear during cutscenes.</p><figure id="" data-id="61b78b3ae42d610fbddc5875629509c2" data-recommend-id="image://61b78b3ae42d610fbddc5875629509c2" data-format="jpg" data-width="960" data-height="540" data-lightbox="true" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Ubisoft</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="61b78b3ae42d610fbddc5875629509c2" data-recommend-id="image://61b78b3ae42d610fbddc5875629509c2" data-format="jpg" data-width="960" data-height="540" data-lightbox="true" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Ubisoft also says it has more surprises to reveal in the future and that this roadmap isn’t everything it has planned, but just the highlights that they wanted to let fans know about.  </p><p>Lastly, <em>Assassin’s Creed Shadows</em> will receive its first paid expansion—<em>Claws Of Awaji</em>—later this year, seemingly sometime after June. It will add a new region to the world as well as a new weapon for Naoi: A bow staff.</p><p>That’s a lot of content and updates! It sounds like come this time next year—assuming Ubisoft sticks to this schedule—<em>Asssassin’s Creed Shadows </em>will be a much bigger and better game, which is impressive considering how excellent the game was at launch last month.</p><p> .<br></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

This game acted as a successor to the <em>Dirt </em>series, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colin_McRae_Rally_and_Dirt&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colin_McRae_Rally_and_Dirt" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">which itself had connections to the studio’s earlier <em>Colin McRae Rally</em> franchise</a></span> that started all the way back on the original PlayStation. But the more disappointing news for fans is that Codemasters is done making rally games altogether. </p><p>As announced in the Wednesday update, Codemasters is “pausing” all current development on future dirt racing rally games, effectively killing the <em>Dirt/Colin McRae </em>rally franchise after two decades and 10+ entries. The last entry in the <em>Dirt </em>franchise,<em> </em><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/games/dirt-5-year-one-edition?_gl=1*170ur3a*_ga*MTc0MjY2NTg1OS4xNzQwMzc1OTc4*_ga_V4QNJTT5L0*MTc0NjAyMjg5NS41OC4xLjE3NDYwMzc2NTQuNjAuMC4w&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/games/dirt-5-year-one-edition?_gl=1*170ur3a*_ga*MTc0MjY2NTg1OS4xNzQwMzc1OTc4*_ga_V4QNJTT5L0*MTc0NjAyMjg5NS41OC4xLjE3NDYwMzc2NTQuNjAuMC4w"><em>Dirt 5</em>, launched in 2020</a></span>.  <em>Kotaku </em>has reached out to EA for more information. </p><p>“For now, we are pausing development plans on future rally titles,” explained Codemasters. “Our [World Rally Championship] partnership was a culmination of sorts for our Codemasters journey with off-road racing, spanning decades through titles like <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/games/colin-mcrae-rally?_gl=1*1yt714s*_ga*MTc0MjY2NTg1OS4xNzQwMzc1OTc4*_ga_V4QNJTT5L0*MTc0NjAyMjg5NS41OC4xLjE3NDYwMzc2NTQuNjAuMC4w&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/games/colin-mcrae-rally?_gl=1*1yt714s*_ga*MTc0MjY2NTg1OS4xNzQwMzc1OTc4*_ga_V4QNJTT5L0*MTc0NjAyMjg5NS41OC4xLjE3NDYwMzc2NTQuNjAuMC4w"><em>Colin McRae Rally</em></a></span>, and <em>Dirt</em>. We’ve provided a home for every rally enthusiast, striving tirelessly to push the boundaries and deliver the exhilarating thrill of driving on the ragged edge. We’ve brought together incredibly talented racing developers, worked with some of the sport’s icons, and had the opportunity to share our love of rallying. Thank you to all the fans who have and continue to be part of our rally journey.”</p><p>The studio promised fans that EA Sports <em>WRC </em>will continue to be “available” to new and existing players, so thankfully it doesn’t sound like the team’s last rally game will be delisted and shut down anytime soon. Still, it’s a shame to see the studio stepping away from rally racing after nearly 30 years of excellent games in a genre that is often ignored by other studios and publishers.</p><p>Codemasters will continue to develop other racing games, like EA’s yearly <em>F1 </em>series and possibly (hopefully) future entries in the track racer franchise <em>Grid</em>. </p><p> .<br></p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
