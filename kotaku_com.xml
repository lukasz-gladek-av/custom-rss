Yet that’s exactly what players discovered after the update went live today, with many breezing through their previous time trial records thanks to their newfound acceleration.</p><p> <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://x.com/RookieMK/status/1950394963055038924&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://x.com/RookieMK/status/1950394963055038924" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">A new clip</a></span> from RookieMK racing against their previous time trial ghost perfectly encapsulates the change:</p><p>While <em>Mario Kart World</em>’s big open map and Knockout Mode get the most attention for bringing fresh ideas to the long-running series, the Switch 2 racer is just as notable, if not more so, for how it reinvents the moment-to-moment gameplay by infusing it with a bit of <em>Tony Hawk’s Pro Skater</em>. Players can now wall-run, grind off rails, and glance off mid-air objects to pick up extra speed boosts. </p><p>The most skilled players are thus effectively racing like they have a secret stash of Mushrooms. The new patch takes things even further, in particular increasing the speed boost after landing from ramp jumps and other mid-air tricks. “You get a ton of extra momentum,” YouTuber svcTyler said in <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OeT-NV0hkXk&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OeT-NV0hkXk" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">a new video</a></span>. “So much momentum to the point that it’s completely trivialized every currently existing world record in the game.”</p><p>  The <em>Mario Kart World </em>records page shows exactly that. Only two new world record times were <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://mkwrs.com/mkworld/recent.php&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://mkwrs.com/mkworld/recent.php" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">posted on July 29</a></span>. Today, there’s been dozens. Nintendo’s stealth change has completely revitalized the speedrunning race, at least until all of the new optimal times get posted and players have to go back to eking out marginal improvements in times. </p><p>.</p></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://kotaku.com/mario-kart-world-patch-update-speed-boost-records-1851787380]]></content:encoded>

Who asked for this? Amazon for starters, which is investing an undisclosed amount in the company behind Showrunner. But even the startup’s CEO, Edward Saatchi, doesn’t sound entirely convinced by the pitch. “Maybe nobody wants this and it won’t work,” he <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://variety.com/2025/digital/news/netflix-of-ai-amazon-invests-fable-showrunner-launch-1236471989/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://variety.com/2025/digital/news/netflix-of-ai-amazon-invests-fable-showrunner-launch-1236471989/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">told <em>Variety</em></a></span>.</p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="195579" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="This Narrative Adventure About Doomed Teenage Dinosaurs Feels Too Real" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="178" data-playlist="195579,197260,197589" data-current="195579"><div><p>This Narrative Adventure About Doomed Teenage Dinosaurs Feels Too Real</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195579/195579_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195579/195579_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195579/195579_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195579/195579_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/21074.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>Billed as “Netflix for AI,” Showrunner is the work of a small, dozen-person start-up called Fable cofounded by Saatchi, who previously specialized in VR entertainment for Oculus. The platform is in beta right now, with users experimenting on “making” episodes for two shows: a <em>Family Guy</em>-looking tech satire called <em>Exit Valley</em>, and a sci-fi romcom about a husband and wife who get transported to another world while fighting at IKEA.</p><p>Early users are currently on the company’s Discord serving up AI prompts like “Ali G meets Joe Biden and Asks him if he wants to buy some feet pics from this super hot chic he knows.” Others include Joe Rogan and Donald Trump arguing about the Epstein files. None of them are actually funny. Of all the ways you could spend time on the internet, watching cringe slop on Showrunner might currently be one of the worst. But that may not even be the point.</p><p> “The ‘<em>Toy Story</em> of AI’ isn’t just going to be a cheap <em>Toy Story</em>,” Saatchi told <em>Variety</em>. “Our idea is that ‘<em>Toy Story </em>of AI’ would be playable, with millions of new scenes, all owned by Disney.” He seems to feel that the interactivity of rapidly sharing, refining, and iterating on prompts gives Showrunner a level of interactivity more reminiscent of video games than traditional TV or  YouTube. </p><p>According to Fable, the goal is to charge users monthly fees to make the shows. Some of that money will in turn go to companies like Disney, who it’s currently in talks with for licensing rights. There are also reportedly guardrails in place to keep the AI-generated shows somewhat narratively consistent and prevent copyright infringement. </p><p>Considering that all of the content already looks like it’s ripping off Fox animated sitcoms, we’ll see how that goes. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/midjourney-ai-disney-lawsuit-copyright-marvel-star-wars-1851784340&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/midjourney-ai-disney-lawsuit-copyright-marvel-star-wars-1851784340">Disney and other Hollywood studios</a></span> are already suing one AI company for allegedly stealing their IP. <br></p><p>.</p></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://kotaku.com/netflix-ai-family-guy-rick-morty-showrunner-fable-1851787372]]></content:encoded>
