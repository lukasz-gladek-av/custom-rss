They’re expensive and  limited, which is why some longtime fans hate them.

Fans were ravenous. </p><p>“The Secret Lair website is currently experiencing extremely high traffic and wait times may be longer than usual,” Wizards of the Coast <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://x.com/MTGSecretLair/status/1932106751882481848&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://x.com/MTGSecretLair/status/1932106751882481848" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">announced</a></span> just five minutes after the <em>Final Fantasy</em> X Secret Lair drop went on sale. “Please monitor the queue page for real-time updates, including product availability in your region.” Long waits and payment processing bugs ensued. It was enough to make some people want to quit the hobby altogether.</p><p>“To get on the site exactly at 11:00am then wait three hours in the check out queue and watch every single thing be bought under me,” <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/magicTCG/comments/1l7ol7r/scalpers_for_the_final_fantasy_secret_lair_make/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/magicTCG/comments/1l7ol7r/scalpers_for_the_final_fantasy_secret_lair_make/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">wrote</a></span> one collector on the MTG subreddit. “Then going on eBay and seeing hundreds of scalpers.” Some people were already reselling full<em> Final Fantasy</em> X Secret Lair sets  for $400 on eBay.

It’s worth remembering that Wizards doesn’t make any money from the second-hand market. Outside of wanting to gin up FOMO to artificially inflate demand, there’s no reason for the company not to just print as many cards as people actually want to buy. </p><p>That seemingly sound logic doesn’t appear to be applying to the regular <em>Final Fantasy</em> Universes Beyond set either, at least not yet. Officially launching on June 13, there’s no word on when re-prints for the best-selling expansion ever will start pouring back into stores. Rumors have suggested as early as July while others have suggested a worst-case scenario of <em>Final Fantasy MTG</em> cards <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/magicTCG/comments/1l7d5z8/no_final_fantasy_reprints_expected_until_q4_2025/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/magicTCG/comments/1l7d5z8/no_final_fantasy_reprints_expected_until_q4_2025/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">being sold out until the mid-fall</a></span>. Maybe by then the scalpers will have moved on to other sets. </p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

I’m not sure the revered director ever uttered the words “unrecorded night” in public before his death, yet the mere possibility of it existing made every diehard Lynch fan reflexively try to figure out what it was about. According to Deming, the series was going to continue Lynch’s focus on Los Angeles, which started with films like <em>Mulholland Drive</em> and <em>INLAND EMPIRE</em>.</p><p>“It was definitely a really interesting… mystery,” he explained. “To me, this was another LA canon for him, and one that sort of mixed in filmmaking and Old Hollywood a bit.”</p><p>One thing Deming is definitive about is that <em>Unrecorded Night</em> “was definitely not <em>Twin Peaks</em>,” the surrealist drama series the reclusive genius is most known for. Lynch previously pointed to his <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.theguardian.com/film/article/2024/aug/05/david-lynch-says-he-is-too-ill-to-direct-films-in-person&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/article/2024/aug/05/david-lynch-says-he-is-too-ill-to-direct-films-in-person" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">declining health</a></span> and disheartening <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://pitchfork.com/news/73313-david-lynch-says-he-is-done-making-movies/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://pitchfork.com/news/73313-david-lynch-says-he-is-done-making-movies/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">changes in the movie industry</a></span> as reasons for him never making movies again. Even so, he was still a filmmaker at his core, as Deming implied they didn’t know how many episodes <em>Unrecorded Night</em> was going to be, since the script was written as one long story rather than an episodic one. “I really love the feature stuff, but he was like, ‘I’m not going to make any more movies. I’m just going to make longer stories because I love the longer story.’”</p><p>Unfortunately for all of us, Deming revealed that they had only scouted locations to film once before COVID-19 hit, which doused any momentum the series had of being created before Lynch’s death. I’m sure there are legions of fans willing to give up their firstborn child to get a copy of that script for a final dive into one of the most eccentric creative minds of our time. But whether it’s released to the public or not, it’s good to know that Lynch was committed to cinematic storytelling until his dying day.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
