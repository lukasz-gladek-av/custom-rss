            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/best-fps-shooters-2025-borderlands-battlefield-doom-first-person-shooter-2000653497">A good first-person shooter</a> doesn’t need to look hyper-realistic, include actual military weaponry, or feature massive levels. Really, all a shooter needs to nail in order for it be considered damn good in my book is simple: Moving and shooting in it should feel great. That’s it. And sadly, recently released “Y2K arena movement shooter” <em>Don’t Stop GirlyPop</em> doesn’t accomplish that, despite a wild and memorable art style and soundtrack.</p> <p><em>Don’t Stop GirlyPop</em> is an indie FPS starring a super soldier of compassion and kindness trying to fight back an alien invasion of corporate-obsessed evil bastards who want to steal and exploit the very love you defend. So you do like any soldier of love and hope would: You grab a wild shotgun that you can freely bedazzle and start blasting fools.</p>

  <p>The FPS is built entirely around moving fast and killing lots of enemies in various arena encounters. Shooting shit is 80 percent of this game, and on paper, that sounds like a great video game to me, a person who loves boomer shooters and most FPS adventures. However, to achieve max speed in <em>GirlyPop,</em> you must repeatedly slam, jump, and dash. And you’ll want to go fast in this new <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2610650/Dont_Stop_Girlypop/">FPS launching on Steam on January 29</a>, because the faster you move, the more damage you do and the more quickly you heal. The problem is that repeating this bunnyhopping-like maneuver requires pressing three different buttons over and over and over again, and it quickly started to tire my fingers out.</p> <p>Worse, when I was at top speed during fights, I felt out of control and not in a fun way. Instead, it made fights turn into a blur of neon colors and random shapes. Slowing down, while it made combat easier to parse, also made me a sitting target. And you move so slow in this game when you aren’t bunnyhopping around that not speeding through fights and platforming sections is a drag.</p>

 <h2>Bad combat, but good music</h2> <p>And as I ping-ponged around the bizarre low-poly arenas that make up most of <em>Don’t Stop GirlyPop</em>‘s world, I often struggled to spot baddies as their models are often made up of thin shapes roughly collected into something that resembles an enemy. If I had a nickel for each fight that lingered on because a few flying bastards were hiding in the garish textures or low-poly environment around me, I’d have enough money to buy a small soda. When I did find them and shoot, I’d often be unsure if they were even taking damage until they died, making guns feel weak in the process.</p>

 <p>But don’t get me wrong, I enjoy how <em>GirlyPop</em> looks! A lot. The mismash of 2000s-era tech and game visuals with bright pink colors and oddly shaped levels is a standout element of the game. It reminds me of some of the weird mods I’d play back in the day in games like <em>Unreal Tournament </em>and <em>Half-Life.</em> It’s just a shame that <em>Don’t Stop GirlyPop</em> sometimes goes too far with how much digital junk and neon it tosses on the screen, such that it can become downright unplayable until the action calms down a tad. A more successful example of a game tapping into this same era of gaming is <a href="https://kotaku.com/quake-2-brazilian-drug-dealer-3-favela-steam-review-fps-boomer-shooter-weird-2000628167">last year’s <em>Brazilian Drug Dealer 3, </em></a>which isn’t nearly as hard to look at when combat happens.</p> <figure id="attachment_2000663627" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000663627"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000663627">©Kwalee / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p>At least, throughout all of this, the music slaps. A few of the battle tracks got stuck in my head long after I stopped playing, which is a very good sign that you’ve made some awesome tunes. I just wish the game’s later levels were as rad as the music. Instead, the more I played, the more I started to dislike my time with <em>GirlyPop</em> as areas became messier and harder to navigate, like I was playing someone’s first draft and not a finished level.</p>

 <p><em>Don’t Stop GirlyPop</em> is an example of a shooter that oozes style and has some cool ideas, like using a flip phone to communicate with your handler, a woman who appears in live-action video clips on your phone’s screen. But its visuals get in the way, and its combat is too focused on chaotic speed and screen-obscuring effects. Perhaps I could still enjoy all of this if the guns were satisfying to use and the enemies fun to kill, but more often than not, I wasn’t sure if I was doing well in a fight or if my guns were even hitting anything. So I’m sorry to say I stopped playing <em>GirlyPop</em> before the game ended. But hey, at least I’ll have the music to jam out, too.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Sony Pushes Its Latest ANC Headphones to a Record Low, the WH-1000XM6 Is Now Priced Below the XM5’s Original Cost]]></title>
            <link>https://kotaku.com/sony-pushes-its-latest-anc-headphones-to-a-record-low-the-wh-1000xm6-is-now-priced-below-the-xm5s-original-cost-2000663639</link>
            <guid>1418404</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Techies and audiophiles are both notoriously fickle crowds, and they love a good debate about the best this or the best that. But they’re overwhelmingly on the same page when it comes to over-ear noise-cancelling headphone: Sony’s WH-1000XM6 are hands-down the very best you can find on the consumer market. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5917/">That’s very relevant right now, because these otherworldly cans are back down to their holiday pricing at Amazon, with a limited-time deal dropping them to just $398.</a></p>
<p>When the WH-1000XM6 headphones dropped last May, our compadres at Gizmodo called them “damn near perfect,” and they were far from alone in that opinion. Sony had set an extremely steep bar for itself when they announced a successor model to the wildly popular WH-1000XM5 headphones, but they cleared that bar with plenty of room to spare by taking all of the WH-1000XM5’s best features and upgrading them even further.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5917/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>No Faults Found</h2>
<p>When Sony went back to the drawing board, their opening move was to give the WH-1000XM6 an improved foldable design to make them even better travel companions. The headband was widened for greater comfort, a 10-band EQ was added to the Sony Sound Connect app for a deeper level of customization, and the battery life was boosted to an almost unheard of 30 hours even while the best-in-class active noise cancellation is engaged.</p>
<p>But the real draw to the Sony WH-1000XM6 wireless headphones is, of course, that noise cancellation. To quote the opening words of every KISS concert: <em>“You wanted the best, you got the best.”</em> Sony’s new QN3 processor is joined by 12 upgraded microphones and AI Noise Optimization to create the absolute best Active Noise Cancellation of any set of wireless headphones anywhere. That title was probably held previously by — you guessed it — Sony’s WH-1000XM5. But those had “only” 8 microphones, and its QN1 processor gets absolutely blown out of the water by the QN3, which is fully 7x faster and therefore far more effective in eliminating external sounds.</p>



<h2>You’re In Control</h2>
<p>Toggling between ANC and Ambient Sound, which allows in enough outside noise for you to be aware of your surroundings, is a simple one-button action in the upgraded interface of the WH-1000XM6. Between the buttons built into the cans and the exceptionally robust set of controls that reside in the Sound Connect app, there are more modes and adjustments available to you than you’ll ever use, but better too many than too few.</p>
<p>The word on the street is that Sony won’t be releasing a WH-1000XM7 wireless headphone in 2026, meaning you can feel free to <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5917/">grab the WH-1000XM6 for just $398 during this limited-time Amazon deal</a> with full confidence that you’re getting the absolute best noise-cancelling over-ear wireless headphones on the market.</p>

              <p>A team lead at beleaguered Ubisoft has claimed (thanks <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ubisoft-employee-suspension/"><em>Insider Gaming</em></a>) that he’s been placed on a three-day unpaid disciplinary suspension after he made public remarks criticizing the publisher’s recent return-to-office mandate. David Michaud-Cromp says he was told by bosses that this was because of “an alleged breach of the duty of loyalty.”</p> <p>In amongst <a href="https://kotaku.com/ubisoft-earnings-layoffs-delays-canceled-ai-2000661869">last week’s shock announcement</a> that Ubisoft was cancelling a number of games (including the&nbsp;<em>Prince of Persia:</em> <em>The </em>Sands<em> of Time</em> remake), delaying others, and restructuring itself such that even more studios would be closed, was a demand that all employees return to their local Ubisoft office five days a week. After this new plan was sprung on 15,000 staff at the same time as it was made known to the public, Michaud-Cromp took to his LinkedIn account on January 23 to vent.</p>

 <p><span><span dir="ltr">“So… Ubisoft wanna bring back 5 days in the office… because they ‘believe in collaboration,'” wrote the Ubisoft Montreal level design team lead, “but c’mon, we’re not completely stupid… we very well know why you want to go back to 5 days in the office… (Spoiler alert: it’s not about efficiency or collaboration).”</span></span></p> <p>Michaud-Cromp is not alone in his criticism of Ubisoft’s declaration that all employees must now return to working full-time in offices. Many Ubisoft staff took to the company’s internal message board to vent their feelings, <a href="https://kotaku.com/ubisoft-stock-restructure-layoffs-cancel-delay-2000662684">as seen and reported on by&nbsp;<em>Kotaku</em> last week</a>, not least because Parisian employees in particular had only recently completed negotiations to ensure they could maintain two work-from-home days a week.</p>

 <p>It seems Michaud-Cromp’s initial comments did not go down well with his bosses. He now claims that his remarks have led to being disciplined. “P<span><span dir="ltr">rofessional update,” he wrote on LinkedIn. “Ubisoft informed me today of a three-day unpaid disciplinary suspension, effective Tomorrow.” He says this was “presented to me as being related to public comments I expressed regarding the company’s return-to-office policy,” alongside the astonishing phrase, “and based on an alleged breach of the duty of loyalty.” He concluded, “I am sharing this information for transparency purposes. I take note of the decision and will make no further comment at this time.”</span></span></p>

 <p>Ubisoft’s latest plan to try to <a href="https://kotaku.com/ubisoft-share-price-crash-prince-of-persia-ai-2000662169">reverse its rapid decline</a> is a restructuring that will simplify development via the creation of a collection of “creative houses,” which appears to be further consolidation of its many teams around the world, and thus another raft of inevitable job losses. In its <a href="https://staticctf.ubisoft.com/8aefmxkxpxwl/59b4Z0RNls45UDTVV6gBNR/801a91a599b337779106af51cf08e539/Ubisoft_Jan_PR_draft_vF.pdf">announcement</a> (a pdf) it adds, “To support the effective implementation and operation of this new model, the Group also intends to return to five days per week on site for all teams, complemented by an annual allowance of working-from-home days.” Why? “This evolution is intended to strengthen collaboration, including constant knowledge sharing, and the collective dynamic across teams.” Um, what? “In-person collaboration is a key enabler of collective efficiency, creativity and success in a persistently more selective AAA market.”</p> <p>Staff appeared to receive this with some hefty cynicism, including Michaud-Cromp’s. Another staff member told <em>Kotaku</em> the move was being made “with zero justification, zero documents, zero internal studies proving RTO increases productivity or morale, nothing.”</p>

 <p>Due to covid, when everyone was forced to work from home, it became apparent how flexible work arrangements actually lead to <a href="https://www.kcl.ac.uk/news/study-shows-working-from-home-has-potential-to-significantly-boost-productivity">improved</a> <a href="https://www.apollotechnical.com/working-from-home-productivity-statistics/">productivity</a>, but bosses at many big companies whose roles are perhaps somewhat threatened by this revelation <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2024/sep/16/amazon-in-person-office-policy">have been pushing back</a>.</p> <p>Ubisoft staff are deeply unimpressed by this new announcement and the threat of yet another round of job losses, and <em>Kotaku</em> has seen at least five unions representing Ubisoft workers call for a three-day strike by all employees in February.</p> <p>We have reached out to both Ubisoft and Michaud-Cromp for further comment.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[If You Need a Mini Gaming PC Instead of the Mac Mini, This KAMRUI Hyper H2 Is 40% Off on Amazon]]></title>
            <link>https://kotaku.com/if-you-need-a-mini-gaming-pc-instead-of-the-mac-mini-this-kamrui-hyper-h2-is-40-off-on-amazon-2000663599</link>
            <guid>1418338</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>If you’re not a fan of bulky and noisy PCs taking over your entire workstation, switching to a mini PC makes sense. These offer reliable performance for everyday tasks in a much smaller (and quieter) form factor. Today is a great time to pick one up, all thanks to Amazon.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6916/">The retailer is offering the Kamrui Hyper H2 mini PC for $460 right now, after knocking a whopping 40% off its usual $769 price</a>. And as if that wasn’t enough, you’ll also enjoy an extra 5% discount at checkout with free delivery, which brings the overall price down even further. But as you’d expect, it’s a limited-time offer that expires soon. If you’ve been eyeing a portable, yet powerful mini PC, this is your chance to upgrade for less.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6916/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Impressive Performance</h2>
<p>The PC is compact, so can easily fit into tighter spaces and cluttered desktops. You can even mount it under the desk or behind the monitor for a cleaner setup. Performance, however, is seriously impressive. The thing runs on a 14450HX processor with 10 cores (6P + 4E), and turbo speeds up to 4.8GHz. Expect roughly 60% higher multi-core performance than the i5-12450H and up to 180% higher than the i7-1185G. Translation? Smooth performance for everyday tasks such as browsing, streaming, and light office work, along with headroom for demanding projects that require more resources.</p>
<p>There’s a modest 16GB of DDR4 memory to keep things running smoothly as you use the PC for a variety of needs. It’s not massive, but it still lets you multitask through busy days without experiencing slowdowns. Storage, on the other hand, is taken care of by a high-speed 512GB M.2 NVMe PCIe Gen4×4 SSD, which offers enough space to house larger files, media libraries, games, and more. What’s even better is that both the memory and the storage capacity are expandable, with support for up to 64GB of DDR4 RAM and as much as 4TB of NVMe SSD storage, if your needs grow in the future. Basically, you won’t have to rely on external solutions with this at hand.</p>



<p>The system is capable of supporting a triple-display setup with HDMI 2.0, DP 1.4b, and a full-featured USB-C port that also supports DisplayPort Alt Mode, 10Gbps data transfer, and 15W power delivery. With this, you can use your primary screen to get work done, while the others for team meetings and displaying reference material. Other connectivity options include Wi-Fi 6 (802.11ax), Bluetooth 5.2, Gigabit Ethernet, two USB 3.2 Gen2 ports (10Gbps), and USB 3.2 Gen1 ports (5Gbps). This selection makes it incredibly easy to connect all your essential peripherals like printers, keyboards, mice, and more, without feeling limited.</p>
<p>Kamrui has also packed the PC with a dual-fan cooling system, which is paired with full copper heat sinks and dedicated aluminum heatsinks to ensure consistent performance, even under heavy loads. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6916/">There’s a lot more to appreciate about this mini PC, especially now that it’s down to just $460.</a> This 40% discount makes the purchase a lot more affordable, but it won’t be around forever. It’s best to grab the offer soon, as it could wrap up any moment now.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/anker-steam-deck-docking-station-was-already-a-value-pick-now-its-at-its-lowest-price-ever-after-another-discount-2000663623</link>
            <guid>1418311</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>When Valve released the Steam Deck, it reset expectations for what portable PC gaming could look like. I mean, they did just copy Nintendo’s homework with the Switch design, but that misses the bigger point. The Steam Deck didn’t ask players to rebuild their libraries or buy special versions of games. Gamers can take their existing Steam collections on the road. That single decision helped create an entirely new class of hardware: handheld gaming PCs. Sure, we’ve always had gaming laptops, but the appeal of being able to easily pick-up and play on a dedicated piece of gaming hardware is undeniable.</p>
<p>As impressive as the Steam Deck is in handheld form, its screen can feel limiting in certain situations. A 7.4-inch display works great on a commute or during travel, but it doesn’t always suit relaxed couch gaming. Sometimes you want to stretch out and play on a large television, the same way consoles have done for years. Thanks to docking solutions, the Steam Deck can handle that role with ease. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6915/">One suitable option comes from Anker, and it’s currently discounted by 10%.</a> The dock usually sells for $33, but a $3 price cut brings it down to a clean $30 for a short time. Sure, it’s not the greatest discount ever, but $30 for a Steam Deck docking station is an absolutely fair value.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6915/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>See Every Detail</h2>
<p>Once connected, the Steam Deck can output to an external display at up to 4K resolution and 60Hz over its HDMI port, a major step up from its native 1280 × 800 handheld resolution. That extra clarity makes a noticeable difference on large TVs and monitors. The dock also works with other devices, including other handheld PCs like the ASUS ROG Ally, Lenovo Legion Go, and even tablets such as the iPad.</p>
<p>The dock supports up to 100W USB-C Power Delivery, keeping the Steam Deck charged while it’s connected to a display. Then when you’re ready to take it on the road, it’ll be at full charge.</p>



<p>It comes with a few built-in USB-A and USB-C ports which allow for wired controllers, keyboards, or other accessories. An integrated Ethernet port supports speeds up to 1,000Mbps, offering a more stable connection for online games and faster downloads compared to Wi-Fi.</p>
<p>The compact design makes the dock easy to pack, great for traveling. You can play handheld on the way to your destination, then dock it to a hotel or Airbnb TV later. The open-face design also allows tabletop use, letting the screen sit at a comfortable angle while you play with a controller, no TV required.</p>
