            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Boring gaming setups are no fun. If you’re looking to add a bit more energy and character to your desk space, gaming lights can make a big difference. There are a bunch of different options in the market to consider, but if you’re looking for something smarter that’s easy to control and also offers creative freedom, we recommend checking out the Govee RGBIC gaming neon rope lights.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5057/">These are flexible, bring life to every setup, and can now be yours for less. Amazon is being generous with a 25% discount on these, which brings the price down to just $75 from its original $100 tag.</a> That’s a nice $25 drop, but the offer might not be around for long. Take advantage of the discount while it’s still live, and while supplies last.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5057/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Millions of Colors to Choose From</h2>
<p>These Govee lights get you 42 independent light segments and 252 LED beads across the 10-foot strip. The inverted illuminated lighting technology removes the typical glare and spotting you often see with traditional LED strips for a smoother glow that’s easier on the eyes. The strip is also flexible, meaning you can shape it around the edge of your desk and even resize it according to your needs using the 12 designated cut points.</p>
<p>Once the strip is all set, you can use the Govee Home app to access 16 million color options, 64+ preset scenes, 11 music modes, and much more. Switching between these literally takes seconds, and you can play around with the modes to get the setup of your dreams. Not in the mood to bother with the in-app controls? Pair your lights with Alexa or Google Assistant and use voice commands to manage the lights.</p>



<p>For an even more immersive experience, you can consider grabbing an AI Gaming Box that syncs your lights with what’s happening on-screen. It’s definitely more of an add-on, but worth it if you’re looking to build a full setup that makes you feel like you’re a part of the game.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5057/">All-in-all, these lights offer a great way to improve your current desktop setup</a>. They add personality to any space, and you have a wide range of colors, plus patterns to choose from. Feeling some boost of energy? Go for vibrant colors. Want to relax while streaming your favorite show? Warm tones should work best. Snag the deal while the 25% discount is still available.</p>

              <p>What would <em>Shadow of the Colossus</em> have been like as an online game? Will <em>Civilization 7</em> finally be good before its one-year anniversary? And what lesson will publishers relying on game key cards for Switch 2 take from <em>Pokémon Legends: Z-A</em>‘s juggernaut physical sales? It’s the latest edition of Morning Checkpoint,&nbsp;<em>Kotaku</em>‘s daily roundup of gaming news and culture. Are you brave enough to <a href="https://x.com/mega64/status/1982951652811518329">spend a night in the Xbox haunted house</a>? The prices keep going up and the games keep leaving.</p> <h2><em>Pokémon Legends: Z-A</em> had the biggest physical launch since <em>Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom</em></h2> <p>That’s with around 6 million copies sold globally, <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/matpiscatella.bsky.social/post/3m46ottuejc2c">according to Circana</a>. <em>The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom</em> sold 10 million copies at launch despite being Nintendo’s first $70 game, with millions of those being physical copies as well despite the overall shift to digital games in recent years. At the time, the 2023 Switch hit pushed “new physical video game software spending” to its highest May total since May 2014.</p>

 <p>This tells us what we’ve already known: some franchises can still buck the trend when it comes to the disappearance of physical games, especially on Nintendo’s platforms. But the question remains: are controversial Switch 2 game key cards a way to satisfy that same demand, or a clumsy band-aid the company’s better ripping off sooner rather than later?</p>

 <h2><em>Call of Duty</em> is still trying to rain on <em>Battlefield 6</em>‘s parade</h2> <p><em>Black Ops 6</em> multiplayer and Zombies is once again going free from <a href="https://twitter.com/CallofDuty/status/1982928103417753961?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1982928103417753961%7Ctwgr%5E11d055f620a693ec5cf2b2fa9081b608928c48f7%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ign.com%2Farticles%2Factivision-announces-call-of-duty-black-ops-6-multiplayer-and-zombies-go-free-again-today-just-as-ea-launches-battlefield-battle-royale-redsec">October 28 through November 3</a>. Is that just a fun Halloween treat from Activision, or another attempt to trick players out of engaging with <em>Battlefield</em>‘s latest content drop? The EA competitor’s new, free-to-play battle royale mode is coming later today. <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-trails-far-behind-battlefield-6-on-steam-preorders">Data firm Alinea Analytics projects</a> that Call<em> of Duty: Black Ops 7</em> has sold under 200,000 pre-order copies so far on Steam, compared to <em>Battlefield 6</em>‘s million pre-orders during the same pre-launch period.</p>

 <h2><em>Civilization 7</em> is still trying to turn the corner</h2> <p>The embattled 4X strategy sequel will get a boost from the addition of a feature players have wanted since launch. Firaxis’ latest <a href="https://civilization.2k.com/civ-vii/news/civ-vii-update-check-in-oct-27/">status update on the status of its updates</a> says it’s currently testing lots of big changes, including an option to play as the same civilization throughout an entire match. One of the game’s big departures was forcing players to swap during age transitions. It’s by far one of the most unpopular new mechanics. Meanwhile, Tide of Power update 1.3.0 arrives next week with pirates and an overhaul of the game’s sea power dynamics.</p>

 <h2><strong><span dir="auto"><em>Shadow of the Colossus</em> started as an online co-op game because the dev loved <em>Battlefield 1942</em></span></strong></h2> <p>Creator Fumito Ueda reflected on the iconic 2005 PS2 game’s legacy in a recent interview <a href="https://news.denfaminicogamer.jp/interview/251027y#i-3">with <em>Denfaminico Gamer</em></a>. “<span dir="auto">Speaking personally, I used to play</span><span dir="auto">&nbsp;<em>Battlefield 1942</em></span><span dir="auto"> a lot at the time,” he said. “I was really impressed by the fact that all the characters on the screen were players, and I felt like, ‘This is the future of gaming.’ </span>I was really drawn to the energy and live feeling of online games, but at the same time, the feeling of excitement and disappointment over winning and losing gradually faded away.”</p> <p><span dir="auto">He continued, “I used to enjoy the excitement of competing against other people, but as I got older, I began to seek a different kind of immersion.

            <link>https://kotaku.com/donald-trump-administration-white-house-halo-gamestop-2000639566</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/white-house-claims-trump-is-%E2%80%98hugely-popular%E2%80%99-with-gamers-despite-sky-high-console-prices.1336723/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><span>Yesterday, the Trump Administration, in all its brain-rotting glory, posted </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/donald-trump-halo-gamestop-console-wars-meme-ai-images-2000639237"><span>an AI mockup of the president in Master Chief armor</span></a><span> as it declared that the man, who has likely never played a moment of </span><i><span>Halo </span></i><span>in his life, had ended the console war. This whole thing started because retail chain GameStop made a joke about the bitter feud between PlayStation and Xbox players finally ending, thanks to the impending arrival of </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/halo-remake-campaign-evolved-playstation-cross-play-2000638951"><i><span>Halo: Campaign Evolved </span></i><span>on PS5</span></a><span>. For some reason, the administration jumped in, presumably because someone on staff pays attention to video game news and only views the world through a memetic lens. Now, in what I can only assume is further committing to the bit, the White House has put out a statement declaring not only that&nbsp; Trump has ended a war, but that he is “hugely popular” with gamers.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>In a statement issued to journalist and ex-</span><i><span>Kotaku </span></i><span>editor </span><a href="https://www.patreon.com/posts/exclusive-white-142217261?utm_medium=clipboard_copy&amp;utm_source=copyLink&amp;utm_campaign=postshare_creator&amp;utm_content=join_link&amp;fbclid=PAZnRzaANtDVtleHRuA2FlbQIxMQABpz3WlKQSLeaQPnwHSgd_8kbdaOk9khYlDlkGwojXSUxrjZoBTQMEypzyzDjJ_aem_4-XJdI-3mwtRpkA9nPgsXQ"><span>Alyssa Mercante</span></a><span>, the White House said that he is the only leader “fully committed to giving power to the players,” which is a reference to GameStop’s tagline. So, taking this at face value, the Trump administration is claiming credit for Microsoft bringing its longest-running series to PlayStation, and saying that under his presidency, gamers are thriving.</span></p>

 <p><span>“Yet another war ended under President Trump’s watch—only one leader is fully committed to giving power to the players, and that leader is Donald J. Trump,” the statement reads. “That’s why he’s hugely popular with the American people and American Gamers.”</span></p>

 <p><span>Putting aside that this is obviously just some White House goon taking the piss out of a situation for the meme, the fact of the matter is, the video game industry has been </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/ps5-gta-6-price-switch-2-trump-tariff-2000618881"><span>thrown into a tailspin by the Trump administration</span></a><span>. The president’s </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/switch-2-price-trump-tariffs-vietnam-china-trade-war-1851774438"><span>tariffs have increased console prices</span></a><span> across the board, with </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/nintendo-switch-2-prices-pro-controllers-tariffs-amiibo-2000614471"><span>Nintendo</span></a><span>, </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/ps5-console-price-increase-sony-america-august-21-2000618873"><span>Sony</span></a><span>, and Microsoft all raising their respective price tags on systems and accessories over the course of 2025. Xbox </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/xbox-series-x-s-price-hike-raise-trump-tariff-microsoft-2000627228"><span>even did it twice</span></a><span>, though it does sound like Microsoft’s internal shifts </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/xbox-microsoft-price-hike-game-pass-layoffs-new-console-2000638546"><span>have contributed to that</span></a><span> as well.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>Trump has done tangible damage to the video game industry in the past 10 months, and yet, there’s an odd, concerted effort within his administration to brand him as some kind of gamer-friendly leader. This includes dumb shit like these memes, but also the Department of Homeland Security’s use of imagery from video games and anime, such as </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/department-homeland-security-halo-ice-pokemon-video-dhs-2000639308"><i><span>Halo</span></i></a> <span>and </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-responds-to-dhs-video-using-the-original-animes-theme-2000628222"><i><span>Pokémon</span></i></a><span>,&nbsp; to try and recruit people to ICE. Misinformation and fascist rhetoric is the Trump administration’s M.O., however, so they’re counting on people to clap and cheer at stupid posts of the president dressed as a character they like while he simultaneously undermines the very industry they’re a fan of. Anyone who falls for this isn’t paying attention, and if a fascist playing AI-generated dress-up as Master Chief is enough to get you to ignore this on top of all the bigger problems happening because of this idiot’s nationwide ego trip, we are well and truly fucked.</span></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Laptops come in all sizes and specs. If your everyday routine involves some heavy multitasking, working with creative apps, gaming with friends or hopping on video calls frequently, you need a machine that won’t slow you down. Think at least 30GB RAM, a spacious solid state, and a powerful processor that’s made to handle whatever your productive days throw at it. Sure, the market’s full of options, but finding one that’s powerful and reasonably priced? That’s the tricky part, but we’ve got good news.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5055/">We just spotted the 16-inch Lenovo IdeaPad Slim 3 on Amazon for just $799, after a massive 73% off its regular price.</a> You’re getting premium, high-end specs for less than $800, which makes it feel like a steal. Just note that the discount is only around for a short time. We recommend getting your orders in before the retailer pushes the price back up to $3,000.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5055/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Heavier Workloads Won’t Be a Problem</h2>
<p>Ideapads are sleek laptops, but they don’t compromise on performance; at all. Here, you’re getting a powerful Intel Core i7-13620H chip that packs 10 cores and 16 threads with clock speeds up to 4.9GHz. It’s made for heavier workloads and even surpasses Intel’s Ultra 7 255U in benchmark comparisons, but that’s not it. The processor is paired with a massive 40GB of DDR5 RAM, which makes it easy to power through demanding tasks without a hint of lag. Using a bunch of different apps at once, hopping between tabs, taking video calls while also presenting – none of that is going to slow you down.</p>
<p>Then there’s the 2TB PCIe SSD that offers plenty of space to store all your data, plus ultra-fast boot times and quicker file access. The display is a 16-inch WUXGA (1920 x 1200) IPS anti-glare panel that delivers sharp, vibrant visuals in all lighting conditions. The 300-nit brightness and 45% NTSC color coverage keep things easy on the eyes, even during longer usage.</p>



<p>Connectivity-wise, you’re covered with Wi-Fi 6, Bluetooth 5.2, a USB-C port (with PD and DisplayPort), two USB-A ports, HDMI, a headphone/mic combo jack, and even a full-sized SD card reader. The machine runs on Windows 11 Pro, which is a great option for both students and work professionals alike.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5055/">There’s a lot more to like about the Lenovo Ideapad 3, especially now that it’s down to $799</a>. Snag it up for less while the offer is still live.</p>

However, SSDs used with the PS5 does require additional cooling. If you’d like to use this SSD with your PS5 console, it’s recommended you pick yourself up a heatsink.
