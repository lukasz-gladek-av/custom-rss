              <p><span>There were two things I wanted most out of </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-legends-za-review-switch-2-bugs-performance-2000637719"><i><span>Pokémon Legends: Z-A</span></i><span>’s</span></a> <a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-legends-za-mega-dimension-review-dlc-raichu-2000653106"><i><span>Mega Dimension </span></i><span>DLC</span></a><span>: </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-legends-za-mega-dimension-evolution-raichu-x-2000652246"><span>Mega Raichu</span></a><span> and the return of Latias to my party. The dragon/psychic monster has been a favorite of mine for over 20 years, and she’s been a mainstay of my team in every game she’s featured in. Latias is flying around the Hyperspace Lumiose City featured in </span><i><span>Mega Dimension</span></i><span>, but I still haven’t caught her yet. Why? </span><i><span>Mega Dimension</span></i><span>’s maddening grind makes catching her and several other Legendary monsters a game of chance, harkening back to some of the more frustrating capture mechanics of </span><i><span>Pokémon</span></i><span>’s past that the series</span> <span>has mostly gotten away from.</span></p> <p><span>Latias, along with several other Legendary Pokémon who aren’t tied to the main plot, is gated behind a mechanic called Special Scans. These allow you to find rare pockets of </span><i><span>Mega Dimension</span></i><span>’s Hyperspace that include powerful trainers to battle, valuable loot, and, in some cases, Legendary monsters you won’t be able to find anywhere else. All of that is well and good, but the mere act of acquiring a Special Scan is already such a time sink that the randomization of what follows makes the whole process an almost insulting waste of your time.</span></p>

 <p><span>To get a Special Scan, you have to grind through </span><i><span>Mega Dimension</span></i><span>’s various mini-quests in Hyperspace. These are typically simple objectives like beating trainers in the Battle Zones, capturing a certain number of Pokémon, or finding loot in the mirrored city. Each of these gives you intel points to contribute to the scan, and it’ll take multiple runs through Hyperspace to reach the appropriate number.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><span>The problem is that the results of Special Scans are randomized. You </span><i><span>might</span></i><span> find a Legendary Pokémon, but you may also find a battle zone full of powerful trainers that can’t give you anything beyond more intel points to do another Scan, or you could stumble into an area of Hyperspace filled with Pokémon you’ve already caught. Sometimes, if you’re lucky, you’ll find a repeat of one of the Rogue Mega Evolution boss fights, which remain one of the best parts of </span><i><span>Legends: Z-A</span></i><span>, but if you’re trying to find the monsters you need to fill the Pokédex, even those feel like a barrier you can’t get around.</span></p>

 <figure id="attachment_2000654219" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000654219"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000654219">© The Pokemon Company / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p><span>There’s no way to game the system and manipulate these scans to lead you where you want to go, and even if they do take you to a Legendary Pokémon’s lair, there’s no guarantee that you’ll go back to Lumiose City with one in a Poké Ball. I’ve put more than 20 hours into </span><i><span>Mega Dimension</span></i><span> and have only found two Legendary Pokémon through these methods, and neither of them was Latias. When I happened upon Virizion’s home after hours of grinding and acquiring one of these scans, I searched every square inch of the space for grass/fighting antelope, and couldn’t find it before the time limit ran out. These Special Scan portals close behind you after you leave, willingly or not, so I spent all that time grinding and battling through Special Scan areas with nothing of value in them to get to this point, all for nothing.</span></p>

 <p><span>Gating Legendary monsters behind chance is bad enough, but making it a lengthy grind to even roll the dice artificially inflates an already hefty expansion that relies on the grind to fill out the time between its better moments. If your sole value determination for a video game is how much time it takes up, </span><i><span>Mega Dimension </span></i><span>offers that with reckless abandon. If you want to feel like you’re accomplishing something rather than wasting your time, Special Scans are one of the most annoying things </span><i><span>Pokémon </span></i><span>has implemented in years.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>In some of the earlier generations, certain Legendary Pokémon were roaming encounters you had to essentially track and follow throughout a region, hoping that you’d stumble upon them in a random battle. This mechanic was notoriously derided, and the series has largely moved away from it, but Special Scans feel like that design philosophy magnified in a way that kills momentum so thoroughly that I’m not sure if I’ll ever actually complete the </span><i><span>Mega Dimension </span></i><span>Pokédex. I guess I can live with that, but I’m pretty fucking sad that my girl Latias is waiting for me in Hyperspace, and we might not get to reunite until another game.</span></p>

              <p>The chances are you’ll know developers Butterscotch Shenanigans from their&nbsp;<em>Crashlands</em> games—enormous open-world action games in which you fight, loot and craft your way to victory. However, if you’re an indie game developer, it’ll be their <em>Coffee with Butterscotch</em> podcast that’s most familiar, the long-running show dissecting everything indie for years. But today I draw your attention toward them for something far, far sillier:&nbsp;<em>How Many Dudes</em> is a forthcoming…I’m not sure there’s a genre title for this…game that asks, how many dudes does it take to kill 30 toddlers and a duck-sized horse? So yes, I spoke to them to see what on Earth is going on.</p> <p>Butterscotch Shenanigans was created by three brothers—Seth, Sam and Adam Coster—and was originally best known for fun, experimental and superbly animated mobile games, like <a href="https://www.bscotch.net/games/flop-rocket"><em>Flop Rocket</em></a>&nbsp;and <em><a href="https://www.bscotch.net/games/quadropus-rampage">Quadropus Rampage</a></em>. That is, until <a href="https://kotaku.com/the-last-game-i-make-before-i-die-fighting-cancer-by-m-1758326409">Sam Coster was diagnosed with stage 4b lymphoma</a>, and the three decided that was the moment to work on something bigger and more substantial. The result was <em>Crashlands</em>, and it proved successful enough, after creating platform game&nbsp;<em>and</em> engine&nbsp;<a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/792710/Levelhead/"><em>Levelhead</em></a>, for the team to move on to <em>Crashlands 2</em>.</p>

 <p>With Sam in remission (and, I’m delighted to report, now officially cancer free!), that sequel was a four-and-a-half-year project, with another six months of updates and new content after launch, leaving the three siblings and their newer colleagues really ready to do something else. Something smaller. Something incredibly dumb. Thus <em>How Many Dudes</em>.</p>

 <figure id="attachment_2000654200" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000654200"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000654200">© Butterscotch Shenanigans / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p>The game plays something like an auto-battler, in which you gather an ever-growing group of dudes who must fight teams of enemies of various bizarre natures. You begin the game with a single dude, tasked with fighting a group of 10 toddlers. Yup, right out of the gate. At this stage you’re essentially an observer, watching the battle play out before you, and you’ll either be relieved or horrified to learn you’ll definitely win. As a result you gain $100 to spend on items you can deploy during battles, and also get to select a new dude to add to your team. In that first choice you can pick between a Knight Dude or a Paladin Dude, and obviously each of the many, many dudes has their own stats and skills. From then on, it’s all about picking the right dudes, deploying the right skills at the correct moments, and trying to save enough money to buy revives for all who fall in battle.</p>

 <p>Having played an early build of <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3934270/How_Many_Dudes/">the demo being released today</a>, I chatted with Seth Coster about why I’d just spent so long punching crowds of toddlers to death.</p> <p>“First of all, those toddlers are gonna be fine,” Coster assured me. “I have it on good authority that they’re happily munching on hay in a farm upstate.” So that’s a relief. But I still wondered how they got here. What process brings a creative team to an idea like this? “In the past, when starting a new game, we would start by asking what we wanted to play, and then we would try to bring that into the world. It has always worked for us in terms of quality—we’ve found that we can make whatever game we set ourselves on, and we can make it at a high level of polish and fun.”</p>

  <p>Despite this, and despite routinely high review scores, Butterscotch Shenanigans has found it tough to get much attention. “It has always been very difficult to get players, press and streamers to notice our games and talk about them,” says Seth. “And I don’t blame them; there are a trillion games out there!” As a result, the team decided to try a new approach this time. “What can people not stop talking about?” they asked themselves, eventually landing on the internet debate about “how many dudes it would take to beat up a gorilla.”</p>

 <p>“We didn’t even have an idea of what the game would be,” notes Seth, “we just wanted to make it about that. From there we iterated fast with no real roadmap or plan—we prototyped the game during the Game Maker’s Toolkit Jam, so there wasn’t really time to overthink it.”</p>

 <p>Five days later they’d created something that felt to them like a mix between <em>Balatro</em> and&nbsp;<em>TABS</em>, a “roguelike thing,” and people’s response to the jam entry was really positive. “We thought we might’ve just struck gold. Or at least copper.”</p> <p>As bizarre as it all sounds, from what I’ve played this appears to be true. While the first couple of rounds where you have little role might seem strange, it ramps up quickly as your decisions have more effect on the results. Which types of dudes you choose to recruit strongly changes your experience in any run, along with the upgrades and bonuses you pick, and with each battle lasting less than 30 seconds, it’s a quick and bloody process.</p> <figure id="attachment_2000654202" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000654202"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000654202">© Butterscotch Shenanigans / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p>So how do you go about deciding the rules here? Who does the research to identify the correct amount of power and skill necessary to win in a fight with 30 duck-sized horses? “An anchor point in the game is the Regular Dude,” explains Seth Coster. He’s the one you start with, the average dude. “Everything in the game is orientated around him—how hard he can hit, and how many hits he can take. So when we’re designing a new enemy, we just ask, ‘Do we think this thing hits twice as hard as a Regular Dude? Five times as hard? TEN? And how many hits can it take compared to a Regular Dude?'”</p>

 <p>So yes, a horse “can probably take lot of punches.” (I hope my mum doesn’t read this article.) A horse-sized duck is the game’s first boss fight, for instance. “Weight classes exist for a reason, and horses are HUGE,” observes Seth. “Plus you gotta get past its flailing legs. Our sophisticated calculations have shown that a horse has 35 times the HP of a Regular Dude, which equates to about 70 seconds worth of regular punches.” Uh-huh. “Trust me, the math is sound.”</p> <p>I wondered, given the nature of that bar discussion topic of how many people it might take to fight a hundred worm-sized tigers and so on, whether the game might also pitch the enemies against one another to decide other natural questions. Who would win in a fight between a horse-sized duck and 100 toddlers? “The game isn’t about the answer,” says Seth very wisely, “it’s about the question. Because the answer to the question can only be, ‘It depends.’ The reason there’s ever a debate about ‘who could win in a fight’ is that the debate is actually about assumptions. How much prep time do the various parties have? If we’re talking about mythical creatures (like lion-sized ants), what kids of liberties are we taking with their capabilities?”</p>

 <p>He’s not done. “If we’re talking about Dudes versus a gorilla, what kinds of Dudes are we talking about? Olympic gymnasts? MMA fighters? Accountants? Marines? And do the Dudes have prep time, or are they just all thrown into the ring with the gorilla without warning?”</p> <p>I’m regretting the question.</p> <p>“The fun of the debate isn’t in having an answer, it’s about exploring all the possibilities. So that’s really what the game has ended up being about! We have LOTS of different types of Dudes in this game, each with their own unique capabilities and limitations. And then we throw them into the ring with a whole bunch of weird opponents to see what happens.”</p> <p>So <em>will</em> the game let the enemies fight, too? No, I’m not asking again. Moving on, I wondered what motivated this return to a smaller, sillier idea, after the success of the <em>Crashlands</em> games. Was it something Butterscotch had missed?</p>

  <p>“Certainly!” says Seth. “When you work on one thing for longer than it takes to get a college degree, you go a little crazy. But also, that one thing tends to take on an outsized importance. When you’re committing that many resources to something, you start to get in your own head about how everything has to be perfect. Especially if you’re trying to make a game that has a big story and lots of world-building.”</p> <p>But in this case? “<span><em>How Many Dudes </em>exists for one reason only: to be fun and stupid. It’s not trying to say anything important. It’s not trying to be anything other than what it is: a goofy game. So whenever we think of something that makes us chuckle, we just throw it in there. We don’t have to ask about the story implications, or whether it ‘fits’ with the world, or how it’s going to integrate into some larger vision for the game.”</span></p> <figure id="attachment_2000654199" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000654199"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000654199">© Butterscotch Shenanigans</figcaption></figure> <p>Butterscotch Shenanigans has always been a very mobile-forward developer, but also one that charges a price for its games instead of littering them with ads and IAPs. Given just how dire things feel in mobile spaces for premium games, I wondered if this is still viable. “I’m not gonna lie…” says Coster. “It’s rough. Over the past nine years, our mobile revenue for new premium launches has declined by about 90 percent. I’m not sure whether others are experiencing the same thing, but that’s one data point for you. On the flipside, Google Play Pass and Apple Arcade do offer much clearer paths to success for a premium game—provided you can get into either of them.”</p> <p>This is why the company has shifted to cross-platform launches. “We plan to launch <em>How Many Dudes</em> on Steam, Google Play and the App Store,” says Seth, “and maybe Xbox if the Game Pass team reads this article and wants to give us a call…”</p>

 <figure id="attachment_2000654203" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000654203"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000654203">© Butterscotch Shenanigans / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p>I highly recommend those&nbsp;<em>Crashlands</em> games, by the way. They feel perfect on a tablet, playable in short bursts, and come with hours and hours of stuff to do. And their daunting scale certainly does suggest a daunting amount of work. Do those games put pressure on the studio to have to match them, or even go bigger, spend more, raise ambitions ever-higher? “There are always expectations and demands,” says the Coster brother, “but that comes with the territory. Players will never stop asking for more sequels and more features and more updates, but that’s just them expressing that they love a thing and want more of it. In a weird way, those player demands don’t create pressure; they just create guidance on possible next steps.”</p> <p>The real pressure, says Coster, comes from within the team. Previous games have been about proving something to themselves, proving they’re capable of making long-lasting “hobby games” (<em>Levelhead</em>) or big and intricate games (<em>Crashlands 2</em>). “But in both cases, those were pressures we put on ourselves.&nbsp;<em>How Many Dudes</em>, on the other hand, feels pretty light by comparison. We’re not out to prove anything about our skills or capabilities. We’re just making something fun.”</p> <p><em>You can get <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3934270/How_Many_Dudes/">the&nbsp;How Many Dudes demo right now from Steam</a>, and go slaughter ducks and toddlers to your heart’s content.</em></p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/amazon-sells-its-tv-soundbar-3-times-cheaper-than-direct-rivals-now-at-record-low-before-christmas-2000654172</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Soundbars don’t have to cost close to $1,000 like the Sonos Arc Ultra to make your TV’s sound much better, especially if your current TV speakers sound weak and thin. Amazon’s <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5862/">Fire TV Soundbar is currently on sale for $99, down from its regular price of $119</a> and this is the kind of aggressive pricing that Amazon uses for all of its hardware brands (including Ring, Blink, and eero). This 2.0 speaker system has two speakers that fit naturally under most TVs without taking over your entertainment center and it makes sound fuller, dialogue clearer, and bass deeper.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5862/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Virtual surround sound that is better than its price</h2>
<p><strong>DTS Virtual:X technology</strong> makes it possible to hear sound in three dimensions from just two speakers, instead of needing several satellite speakers placed around the room. The processing looks at audio signals and makes it seem like sound is coming from different directions and heights and makes movies, shows, and games more immersive without the cost and complexity of real surround systems. <strong>Dolby Audio suppor</strong>t makes this effect even better by keeping detail and dynamic range across all kinds of content, from quiet dialogue scenes to loud action scenes.</p>
<p>The included HDMI cable makes setup quick and easy because it connects directly to your TV’s HDMI eARC or ARC port. This one cable connection sends both audio and control signals, so the soundbar turns on when you turn on your TV and responds to volume changes from your TV remote. You don’t have to mess with optical cables, figure out how to use complicated menu settings, or set up universal remotes to make everything work well together.</p>



<p>The <strong>soundbar is 24 inches long and only 2.5 inches tall</strong> so it will fit comfortably on most TV stands and entertainment consoles without blocking your TV screen or infrared remote sensors. This small profile works best with TVs that are small to medium-sized, since a big soundbar would look out of place and take up too much space. You can put it right in front of your TV stand or mount it on the wall below your TV if you want a cleaner look.</p>
<p><strong>Bluetooth makes the soundbar more useful</strong> than just for TV audio: You can also stream music directly from your phone or tablet. You can play music from Spotify, Apple Music, or any other audio app on your device without having to turn on your TV or switch inputs. The wireless connection pairs quickly and stays stable over normal room distances, so you can control playback from your couch or even another room without losing sound.</p>



<p>If you have a Fire TV device, the integration works perfectly and lets <strong>you control both your TV and audio settings with just one remote</strong>. The soundbar automatically picks up Fire TV commands and changes the volume for different types of content and it works with smart TVs and any TV that is connected to streaming media players from other brands, like Roku, Apple TV, or Chromecast, even if you don’t use Fire TV devices.</p>
<p>You can get a big improvement in sound quality for $99 instead of $119, which is about the same price as a nice dinner out. You can find budget soundbars from generic brands in this price range, but they don’t have DTS Virtual:X processing, Dolby Audio support, or the ability to work with Fire TV like Amazon’s does.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Video Game Console Sales Just Flatlined Ahead Of The Holidays As Prices Soar]]></title>
            <link>https://kotaku.com/switch-2-ps5-prices-sales-inflation-economy-2000654196</link>
            <guid>1386109</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>A new Nintendo console is on the market <a href="https://kotaku.com/light-up-the-town-cozy-christmas-holiday-lights-simulator-steam-demo-review-2000652213">this Christmas</a> for the first time in eight years, but that apparently wasn’t enough to juice overall hardware sales. According to the latest data, last month was the worst November for new video game hardware sales in the U.S. since 1995, the year the original PlayStation launched here.</p> <p><a href="https://bsky.app/profile/matpiscatella.bsky.social">Circana’s Mat Piscatella reports</a> that only 1.6 million new consoles were sold last month, including during Black Friday. That’s just a few hundred thousand more than the 1995 low of 1.4 million. Perhaps just as surprisingly, the Switch 2 wasn’t even the best-selling hardware in November. That honor went to the PS5, a console that’s five years old and ended up not benefiting from the expected <a href="https://kotaku.com/grand-theft-auto-6-delay-november-gta6-reaction-news-2000641817"><em>Grand Theft Auto 6</em></a> launch hype this year.</p>

 <p>Part of that no doubt came down to a discrepancy in Black Friday deals. Sony was aggressively discounting the all-digital PS5 by $100 while Nintendo actually got rid of its long-standing <a href="https://kotaku.com/switch-2-black-firday-sales-2025-mario-zelda-2000642413"><em>Mario Kart 8 Deluxe</em> bundle</a> for the original Switch. The Switch 2 did end up getting some surprise discounts from retailers by <a href="https://kotaku.com/switch-2-sale-cyber-monday-mario-kart-world-walmart-amazon-2000649232">Cyber Monday</a>, but that ended up falling on December 1 this year, so it doesn’t fall within this period.</p>   <p>Piscatella reports that the average price of a new console “reached an all-time November high of $439, up 11 percent compared to a year ago.” Back in November 2019 the average was just $235. That’s partly the impact from <a href="https://kotaku.com/ps5-gta-6-price-switch-2-trump-tariff-2000618881">President Trump’s trade war</a> which led Nintendo, Sony, and Microsoft to all implement multiple rounds of price increases in 2025. A new Xbox Series X, first released five years ago for $500, now costs $650 at Best Buy.</p>

 <p>Microsoft was also notable for being the only hardware manufacturer not to discount its consoles at all during the holiday season. It’s almost as if the company’s been trying <em>not</em> to sell new hardware, encouraging players instead to play its games in the cloud or on rival platforms. The Xbox ended up coming in third for the month, even as <a href="https://kotaku.com/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-sales-activision-2000652111"><em>Call of Duty: Black Ops 7</em></a> launched as November’s best-selling game (it will likely still remain behind <em>Battlefield 6</em> for the year, however).</p> <p>Is console gaming <a href="https://kotaku.com/donald-trump-administration-white-house-halo-gamestop-2000639566">just getting too expensive</a>? Is the floor <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/US/us-economy-flashes-warning-signs-new-data-analysts/story?id=128463726">secretly falling out</a> from under the U.S. economy? Why not both, Piscatella <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/matpiscatella.bsky.social/post/3ma6uq52s3c22">suggested</a>. “Correlation does not necessarily imply causation…unless it does,” he wrote when speculating about the drop-off in console sales. With Roblox free and <em>Fortnite</em> back on phones, it’s never been easier for parents to look at the $500 sticker price for a new system and say, “no thanks.”</p>

              <p>Mini computers offer a great way of enjoying powerful performance while keeping things minimal and mess-free. If you’re after a solid option from Apple, Amazon is making the upgrade quite easy.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4124/">If you act fast, you can grab the 2024 Mac mini desktop computer (16GB memory, 256GB storage) with the super-fast M4 chip for $479, after a nice 20% discount.</a> It’s rated as Amazon’s Choice at the retailer, and has plenty of good reviews backing it up. Those looking to have it delivered before Christmas should place their orders today, as delays can push the delivery past the holiday season. Not married to the Apple brand? There are plenty of other mini PCs going at a discount right now, too. We’ve been covering the best drops (across multiple retailers) out there, so be sure to check our Deals page to find the one that fits your needs and budget.</p>

<h2>Supercharged By M4</h2>
<p>This mini, yet mighty PC is five by five inches of incredible power. Design-wise, it’s quite sleek and is made to sit nicely next to a monitor, or anywhere else, without cluttering things up. It runs on the powerful M4 chip, which delivers incredible performance for all your tasks, whether you’re working on a group project for school, editing a creative project, developing a presentation, or brainstorming ideas. The chip also makes it up to 13x faster than the fastest Intel-based Mac mini, which means you can rely on it for your everyday tasks, as well as those busy, productive days where you’re handling a bit too much at the same time. Additionally, macOS is quite convenient to use and lets you run all your favorite apps responsively.</p>
<p>Apple Intelligence integration takes the experience even further. It’s Apple’s personal AI system that lets you search, write, develop ideas, communicate, and create stuff with ease. You’re getting personalized tools for a bunch of tasks, which can help you get a lot more done throughout your day.</p>
<p>There’s a 16GB memory to keep things running smoothly. It’s not massive, but you should be able to perform some light multitasking with ease. Storage is taken care of by the built-in 256GB SSD. Again, it’s not the biggest out there, but it does a good job at housing all your important files and content in a single place.</p>



<p>The PC also includes Thunderbolt, HDMI, and Gigabit Ethernet ports on the back, plus, for the first time, front-facing USB-C ports and a headphone jack. These are enough to connect all your important peripherals without feeling limited. What’s more, the Mac mini plays nicely with other Apple devices like iPhones and iPads, too. When using it with your iPhone, for instance, you can mirror your smartphone on the monitor and control it from there. You can move things around, copy something on the iPhone and paste it on the Mac, reply to texts, take FaceTime calls, and more.</p>
<p>There are a lot of other features to like here, but to wrap it up, if you’ve been looking to upgrade your workstation by grabbing something fast and efficient, we highly recommend considering the 2024 Mac mini desktop computer. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4124/">It’s now going for $479, meaning you can save over $100 on your purchase, but only if you grab it quick.</a></p>
