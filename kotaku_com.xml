It also teased a devastated New York City.

Reportedly, <em>BF6 </em>will arrive on October 10. The game will be available in two versions: A standard edition and a “Phantom Edition.” This Phantom Edition will be digital only and will include additional in-game content, likely cosmetics. Neither version will provide early access. Pre-orders will go live on July 31. </p><p><em>Battlefield 6</em>'s prices were also leaked, but they are in Euros, and it’s not clear yet how that will translate to the United States and other regions. At the very least, it appears the Phantom Edition will cost $30 more than the standard release. </p><p>Billbil-kun also reports that there will likely be an open beta for<em> Battlefield 6</em> available in August. This follows months and months of closed alpha testing. </p><p>We won’t have to wait long to find out how much of this report and its data-mined information is accurate. Tomorrow, on July 24, EA and its team of studios working on <em>Battlefield 6</em> will unveil the first trailer for the game, and we’ll likely be told its official release date and more. </p><p> .<br></p></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://kotaku.com/bf6-battlefield-6-leak-october-launch-early-access-beta-1851786824]]></content:encoded>

I think we increased production runs on it 4x pre-release. It was substantially by many, many very high double-digit percentages ahead of any other production run we’ve ever done, and we left the market wanting more.”</p><p>That might come as a surprise to fans who have struggled to find <em>MTG</em> booster packs and Commander decks for the <em>Final Fantasy</em> set, with stock selling out during advance pre-order periods and then being marked up over MSRP at some locations by the time it hit store shelves. But critics who sometimes claim that Wizards of the Coast artificially limits supply to drive hype and engagement should be happy to know that the company intends to keep selling new <em>Final Fantasy </em>stock for a while yet. </p><p>“Our expectation is there’s going to be a nice long tail of backlist for the product. Likewise, we’re still selling <em>Lord of the Rings</em> product today,” Cocks said. “So even though we hit $200 million in December of ‘22 for<em> Lord of the Rings</em>, we sold a substantial percentage of that in the several years following and we expect <em>Final Fantasy</em> to be no different. It’s partially what’s powering our backlist, which already in, like, five and a half months in the year did more than we’ve ever done in any year prior.” Hasbro chief financial officer Gina Goetter added, “We’re continuing to produce this set. We think the set itself is going to have a huge long tail.” </p><p>While the rarest and most expensive cards in the set were only available in Collector Boosters, the initial print run of which is basically all sold out, regular cards in the set will continue to become available and hopefully drive down prices on some of the more sought-after standard cards. One of those is Vivi Ornitier, a mythic Legendary Creature from<em> Final Fantasy IX</em>. It’s a powerful card that synergizes well with lots of mana-hungry, spell-based decks and has been hovering around $45 for weeks now. Other examples include Knights of the Round and Bahamut summons. Unlike with standard <em>MTG</em> sets, fan interest in the cards for their own sakes, combined with their limited availability, is currently fueling <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/golden-chocobo-mtg-final-fantasy-price-foil-restock-1851784836&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/golden-chocobo-mtg-final-fantasy-price-foil-restock-1851784836">a particularly brutal reseller market for collectors</a></span>. </p><p>One upside is that those who just want to have fun playing with the cards can collect them much more cheaply in<em> Magic The Gathering Arena</em>, the video game adaptation for PC and mobile. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/baldurs-gate-4-d-d-mtg-arena-commander-g-i-joe-1851703869&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/baldurs-gate-4-d-d-mtg-arena-commander-g-i-joe-1851703869">It’s due for an update at some point in the future</a></span>, though Cocks also noted that the app only accounts for a small slice of the current fanbase. “Only 15-or-so percent of the player base plays on something like <em>Arena</em>,” he said. <br></p><p>.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://kotaku.com/final-fantasy-mtg-magic-gathering-vivi-stock-1851786817]]></content:encoded>

Monolith Soft’s flagship RPG series has consistently pushed the limits of Nintendo’s hardware, cramming massive and lush worlds into hardware that’s roughly a generation behind the home console competition. The results are typically impressive, if not a bit compromised. <em>Xenoblade Chronicles 2</em> in particular could suffer from some dips in image quality due to dynamic resolution scaling, and performance wouldn’t necessarily hold at 30 FPS either.</p><p>I’m not 100% sure these issues are <em>totally </em>smoothed over after watching <em>Xenoblade Chronicles 2</em> run on my Switch 2 with my naked eye, but they’re at least greatly minimized. Overall, the experience is just better on the new hardware. The resolution doesn’t appear to dip in the game’s usual trouble spots, and the frame rate didn’t take noticeable hits either. I do hope the <em>Xenoblade</em> series can get proper Switch 2 upgrades, as the game could clearly look way sharper if it wasn’t capped at such a low resolution (especially in handheld mode). That said, this series also contains over 500 hours of content if you intend to 100-percent each game, so I think it’s perfectly okay to get started on it now.</p><h2 id="h576957"><a id=""></a>4: <em>Super Mario RPG</em></h2><figure id="" data-id="dc84c8e9b71cb406f91abd0cdaa3cf44" data-recommend-id="image://dc84c8e9b71cb406f91abd0cdaa3cf44" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="720" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A screenshot of Super Mario RPG for the Nintendo Switch.

That said, the remake of the game <em>is</em>, and it didn’t always hold at a 60 FPS throughout its runtime on the original Switch. This is most noticeable in the game’s opening, but you can feel the occasional slowdown elsewhere too.</p><p>Fortunately, the Switch 2 smooths over these trouble spots effortlessly. Between the remaster of <em>Paper Mario: The Thousand-Year Door </em>and the all new <em>Mario &amp; Luigi: Brothership</em>, the past few years have been great for <em>Mario </em>RPG fans. That latter title benefits from the Switch 2 hardware too! If you’ve never tried these quirky adventures, you’re in for a treat whether you’re a casual gamer or a hardcore RPG nut.</p><h2 id="h576958"><a id=""></a>5: <em>Bayonetta 3</em></h2><figure id="" data-id="bdda8603fb00605e4e0d7511a7755052" data-recommend-id="image://bdda8603fb00605e4e0d7511a7755052" data-format="jpg" data-width="2550" data-height="1434" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A promotional screenshot of Bayonetta 3.

On the original Switch, <em>Bayonetta 3 </em>generally targeted 60 FPS but usually didn’t hit it. Instead, the game would hover in the 50 FPS range and could drop <em>way </em>lower during certain attack animations. It’s not unplayable by any means, but obviously there’s room for improvement.</p><p>Which is <em>exactly </em>what <em>Bayonetta 3</em> on the Switch 2 serves up. Not only do you get those smooth 60-FPS graphics (where it’s possible in the game), but the Switch 2 even fixes some audio desync bugs that could pop up in the original sometimes. Load times are way faster too. If we weren’t limiting this list to Switch-exclusive games, <em>Bayonetta 3</em> would still be one of the most improved games on Nintendo’s next generation hardware.</p><p>As was the case with <em>Xenoblade Chronicles</em>, it would still be nice for <em>Bayonetta 3</em> to get a proper Switch 2 upgrade. If nothing else, the visuals would pop if the resolution was raised, especially in handheld mode. But even if that never comes to pass, there’s no denying that <em>Bayonetta 3</em> is better than it’s ever been before.</p><p>.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://kotaku.com/switch-2-games-run-better-upgrade-bayonetta-hyrule-xeno-1851786809]]></content:encoded>

Signing up in 2020, she said the relationship was ideal since it allowed her to maintain her privacy and focus on streaming as Ironmouse while the agency handled the business side of things. That seemed to go fine until recently, when VShojo allegedly stopped paying out funds it owed to the Vtuber and the charities she had supported. </p><p>“I believe that I am owed a significant amount of funds which I have not been paid,” Ironmouse said. “And most importantly, the Immune Deficiency Foundation is owed over half a million dollars from VShojo. I really wish that I could tell you more, but right now I have been advised to wait for legal proceedings.

Ironmouse said she’s helped raise over $4 million for the organization over the years, with last year’s subathon expected to donate an additional $515,000 in money paid directly by fans through Twitch. While that money has allegedly never been paid out, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://tiltify.com/@ironmouse/ironmouse&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://tiltify.com/@ironmouse/ironmouse" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">a new Tiltify campaign</a></span> with a goal of $1 million for the foundation has already raised over $850,000. </p><p>VShojo did not immediately respond to a request for comment. </p><p>Ironmouse isn’t the only Vtuber currently speaking out against the agency. “I have been lied to from the company a lot about the situation,” Vtuber Kson <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://youtu.be/cBxw80mZoWI&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://youtu.be/cBxw80mZoWI" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">recently said</a></span>. “My payments stopped last September. I was asking what’s going on for a long time, multiple times. All they said was, ‘It’s going to be paid,’ and it was never paid, and I think it will never be.”</p><p>Vtuber Kuro also announced she’s leaving VShojo yesterday. “I didn’t want to say anything until its finalized but since people keep making assumptions, no I am not staying here I’ve already submitted a leave contract and had that meeting 11 days ago,” she <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://x.com/K9_KURO/status/1947656711524798886&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://x.com/K9_KURO/status/1947656711524798886" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">wrote on X</a></span>. “The only reason I still have the VShojo brand logo on here still is because they have to remove it themselves, as an associate u can not remove it yourself (same with everyone other member) in any case I’m just waiting for the contract to be all fulfilled and done but I guess I’m an indie now LOL.” </p><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.vshojo.com/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.vshojo.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Of the 13 Vtubers listed on VShojo’s website</a></span>, the majority have all posted messages announcing they’re taking breaks from streaming or explaining that they are cutting ties with the talent agency.
