<p>If you‚Äôre pining for the days when games like <i>F-Zero</i> and <i>WipEout</i> offered up blistering fast races, then Nintendo Switch 2 launch title <i>Mario Kart World</i> might feel a little slow for you. Worry not, speed demon, as there‚Äôs another racer in the launch lineup that might just tickle your fancy. Enter: <i>Fast Fusion</i>.</p> <p>The fourth title in the Fast franchise, <i>Fast Fusion</i> takes everything that has worked well for the series over the past few generations and pumps it up to 4k / 60 fps to provide one of the Nintendo Switch 2‚Äôs most attractive and heart-pounding gameplay experiences. Here‚Äôs how long it‚Äôll take you to experience this face-melting thrill ride in its entirety, what machines are best, and more.</p> <h2><span id="how-many-tracks-are-in-fast-fusion"></span>How many tracks are in <i>Fast Fusion</i>?<span></span></h2> <p>At launch, <i>Fast Fusion</i> offered 12 different tracks, with half of them originally from 2015‚Äôs Wii U title <i>Fast Racing Neo</i>. In late June of this year, developer Shin‚Äôen Multimedia released the first of its promised free updates that added an additional six tracks. The update also added a new rendering option and new music.</p>

 <h2><span id="what-are-some-of-the-best-machines/vehicles-in-the-game"></span>What are some of the best machines/vehicles in the game?<span></span></h2> <p>Of the 15 vehicles, or ‚Äúmachines‚Äù as the game refers to them, Kamagori, Spaarc, Guang Zhou, Mueller, Cebra, Mech Guyva, and Rochdale &amp; Ziro are all excellent choices. That said, if you‚Äôre just starting out, the Cebra is a good way to get a feel for the game.</p> <h2><span id="how-many-people-can-play-at-once"></span>How many people can play at once?<span></span></h2>  <p><i>Fast Fusion</i> supports up to eight players when playing online, and four people can play via split-screen locally on the same Switch 2.</p> <h2><span id="how-long-does-it-take-to-beat-fast-fusion"></span>How long does it take to beat <i>Fast Fusion</i>?<span></span></h2> <p><i>Fast Fusion</i> demands that you become adept at rapidly dodging obstacles, alternating between color modes to match on-track speed boosts, and managing your own personal boost meter. Races in <i>Fast Fusion</i> are extraordinarily fast, and a mere one or two mistakes can cost you the whole race.</p>

 <p>Success and completion in <i>Fast Fusion</i> will come down to how well you can master these intriguing mechanics and overcome its Championship mode. There are multiple cups to beat on your way to finishing this mode, but you can‚Äôt just eek your way through them with placement.</p> <p>Instead,<i> Fast Fusion</i> requires you to purchase the Championship mode cups using currency you earn from racing. Since this currency is also used to purchase new vehicles, you‚Äôll probably need to repeat some cups a few times to have enough to unlock everything you need to overcome future cups.</p>

 <p>When you mix <i>Fast Fusion</i>‚Äòs challenging gameplay with a reliance on currency over placement, you get a game with a playtime that is hard to nail down. But if you‚Äôre skipping new vehicle purchases and focusing solely on unlocking and finishing cups, <b>you can probably see the end of the Championship mode in 2-3 hours</b>.</p> <p>There‚Äôs more to do after you complete Championship mode, however. You can check out Time Attack mode to see how quickly you can clear tracks, or dive into Super Hero mode for a significantly more challenging racing experience. And though <i>Fast Fusion</i>‚Äòs multiplayer functionality leaves a bit to be desired thanks to lack of matchmaking, it can still be a fun diversion with friends.</p> <p>All-in-all, <i>Fast Fusion</i> is a fast, frenetic racing title that offers Nintendo Switch 2 owners something truly nerve-rattling (in a good way) to play on their new hardware. For only $14.99, you could make considerably worse decisions while perusing the eShop.</p> <hr> <p><i>Fast Fusion</i> is available now exclusively on Nintendo Switch 2.</p>

              <p><em>Roblox</em> is possibly the most popular gaming platform on the planet‚Äîfar more popular than you might think. <a href="https://kotaku.com/grow-a-garden-roblox-5-million-active-users-record-pc-1851781824"><em>Grow a Garden</em></a>, a game built within the app, recently had 21.9 million concurrent players, dwarfing the likes of <em>Fortnite</em> and&nbsp;<em>Counter-Strike 2&nbsp;</em>by multiple times. And that‚Äôs despite being an application recently described as <a href="https://kotaku.com/roblox-hindenburg-report-pedophile-hellscape-for-kids-1851668649">‚Äúa pedophile hellscape for kids.‚Äù</a> Well, it can now add another similar accolade to its collection, as the entire state of Louisiana has announced it‚Äôs suing&nbsp;<em>Roblox</em>, calling it ‚Äúa breeding ground for sex predators.‚Äù</p> <p>Louisiana attorney general Liz Murrill announced the action via X, explaining that she‚Äôs coming after the gaming platform due to its ‚Äúlack of safety protocols,‚Äù and the claim that this results in danger for children. Which, in most circumstances, might come across as all-too-familiar hyperbole from a member of government looking for a moral panic to latch onto. It‚Äôs just, in the case of <em>Roblox</em>, it‚Äôs something that‚Äôs been demonstrated to be true <a href="https://kotaku.com/its-shocking-just-how-shady-roblox-actually-is-1847522070">over</a> and <a href="https://kotaku.com/roblox-child-account-safety-settings-danger-1851680045">over again</a>. But no matter the accuracy, the question remains: What is the actual, practical purpose of this suit?</p> <p>‚Äú<em>Roblox</em> is overrun with harmful content and child predators,‚Äù says Murrill, ‚Äúbecause it prioritizes user growth, revenue, and profits over child safety. Every parent should be aware of the clear and present danger poised to their children by <em>Roblox</em> so they can prevent the unthinkable from ever happening in their own home.‚Äù</p> <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">üö® BREAKING: Today I‚Äôm suing Roblox ‚Äì the #1 gaming site for children and teens ‚Äì and a breeding ground for sex predators.</p> <p>Due to Roblox‚Äôs lack of safety protocols, it endangers the safety of the children of Louisiana. Roblox is overrun with harmful content and child predators‚Ä¶ <a href="https://t.co/p98Sq8vvMb">pic.twitter.com/p98Sq8vvMb</a></p> <p>‚Äî Attorney General Liz Murrill (@AGLizMurrill) <a href="https://twitter.com/AGLizMurrill/status/1956081394083409932?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">August 14, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <p><a href="https://aglizmurrill.com/Article/322">The longer statement</a> goes on to describe the motivation behind the suit.</p> <blockquote><p>‚ÄúBecause there is no age minimum and requirement to verify age or parental permission once you sign-up, users can easily say they are younger or older than their actual age ‚Äì allowing child predators to pose as children and for children to bypass any age requirement.</p> <p>Once registered, users have access to millions of games such as sports, role-playing, naval, fashion, and comedy. Other games which have existed on the platform including Escape to Epstein Island, Diddy Party, and Public Bathroom Simulator Vibe are not as innocent. These games and others are often filled with sexually explicit material and simulated sexual activity such as child gang rape.‚Äù</p></blockquote> <p>Again, every muscle in my body wants to type out why this Republican AG is wrong and how she‚Äôs willfully misinterpreting the facts to condemn a topic she doesn‚Äôt understand‚Ä¶but, well, <a href="https://kotaku.com/roblox-child-account-safety-settings-danger-1851680045">I‚Äôve tested it all for myself</a>, and it‚Äôs true. You can absolutely sign up as being any age up to 17 without any verification requirements, and passing as over 17 isn‚Äôt a herculean effort. But there‚Äôs little need, since many of the violent and sexual games are simply marked as suitable for teens so there‚Äôs no restrictions to playing them. Oh, and despite my own son not being allowed to use <em>Roblox&nbsp;</em>(I am the&nbsp;<em>meanest</em> father), his friends do and so I get to hear about ‚ÄúDiddy Party‚Äù and the like far more often than anyone could want.</p> <p>Changes were made toward the end of 2024 that added new options for parents, allowing them to prevent their under-13s from being able to use in-game chat features, and that stopped children under 9 from accessing teenage content. However, it‚Äôs more extraordinary that even these most basic levels of protection hadn‚Äôt been included for the app‚Äôs first 18 years. And even in the wake of these changes, there‚Äôs still nothing to stop a 13-year-old from accessing very adult content or having un-monitored text communication with anyone. (As a parent of a 10-year-old who plays <em>Gorilla Tag</em> on his VR, I‚Äôm acutely aware how much more pernicious text chat is than audio.)</p> <p>Teenage privacy and online communication is a massively fraught and complex subject, one for each family to wrestle with among themselves, but it remains the case that <a href="https://kotaku.com/roblox-hindenburg-report-pedophile-hellscape-for-kids-1851668649">investigations into&nbsp;<em>Roblox</em></a> have found groups ‚Äúopenly trading child pornography and soliciting sexual acts from minors,‚Äù even when signed in using under-13 accounts.</p> <p>Now, obviously the vast majority of the 80 million people who play&nbsp;<em>Roblox</em> every day are fine, even if they‚Äôre having their precious youths wasted on <a href="https://kotaku.com/steal-a-brainrot-roblox-empire-review-popular-memes-1851787027">Italian Brainrot memes</a>. I think what most people are after is just more effort on the parts of the owners to better protect young users from the <a href="https://www.wafb.com/2025/04/17/man-accused-kidnapping-10-year-old-he-met-roblox-discord/">very obvious harms that are possible</a>. Although given some of <a href="https://kotaku.com/roblox-boss-kids-child-labor-exploit-indonesia-slum-1851387795">the awful things those owners are wont to say</a>, hopes for common sense aren‚Äôt high.</p> <p>It‚Äôll be interesting to see what this peculiar lawsuit is intended to achieve. It seems more like attention-seeking noise than anything practical. The article cites the same Hindenburg Research investigation we‚Äôve linked above, and then mentions a recent case in Livingston Parish where a home was raided after someone was trying to lure children via <em>Roblox </em>(we haven‚Äôt been able to verify this, and even <a href="https://aglizmurrill.com/Files/Article/322/Documents/RobloxLawsuit.pdf">the text of the official lawsuit</a> doesn‚Äôt cite any evidence), before stating, ‚ÄúFor these and other reasons,&nbsp;<em>Roblox</em> is in violation of Louisiana law.‚Äù</p> <p>Which laws?</p> <p>‚ÄúThe State is seeking permanent injunctive relief and prohibiting them from:</p> <ul> <li>Engaging in any activity in violation of Louisiana Unfair Trade Practices Act:</li> <li>Representing that Roblox has adequate safety features</li> <li>Restitution to the State of Louisiana</li> <li>Attorney‚Äôs fees</li> <li>All additional civil penalties allowable under law</li> <li>All additional damages allowable under law‚Äù</li> </ul> <p>Presumably there‚Äôs a hope that this will force Roblox, the company, to take its responsibilities more seriously, given it cannot control its distribution on a state-by-state level. However, it seems more likely the kerjillion-dollar company will just settle to make it all go away.</p>

              <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-legends-z-a-link-play-multiplayer-switch-2-1851787158"><em>Pok√©mon Legends: Z-A</em></a> is the first game in the franchise to move from turn-based battles to real-time combat, and it sounds like it will take some getting used to. The first gameplay was revealed to content creators and critics ahead of the 2025 Pok√©mon World Championships in Anaheim, California, where it became clear developer Game Freak is unafraid <a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-legends-z-a-switch-trailer-mega-evolution-az-1851766880">to change-up some decades-old formulas</a>.</p> <p>The demos were brief, split between 10 minutes of regular trainer battles and 10 minutes of a raid-like encounter against a Mega Evolution Abso. Unlike <a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-legends-arceus-alpha-pokemon-tone-nintendo-swit-1848478468">in 2022‚Äôs<em> Arceus</em></a>, <em>Pok√©mon Legends: Z-A</em> has you move around a battle in real-time, telling your Pok√©mon which moves to use or when to get out of the way at will. <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/features/hands-on-pokemon-legends-z-a-proves-legends-is-still-pokemons-most-exciting-series/"><em>VGC</em> noted</a> that you can even sneak up on enemy trainers to get an advantage in battle, while <a href="https://www.theverge.com/games/759788/pokemon-legends-z-a-battle-real-time-preview"><em>The Verge</em> compared</a> the Mega Evolution showdown to ‚Äúa classic 3D&nbsp;<em>Zelda&nbsp;</em>boss.‚Äù Your trainer can even take damage herself during these battles.</p> <p>You can see what they‚Äôre describing in some of the hands-on footage from <a href="https://serebii.net/">Serebii <em>Pok√©mon</em> expert</a> Joe Merrick:</p>

This lets you use any attack an unlimited number of times, but only once its meter is full. ‚Äú<em>Legends: Z-A</em> didn‚Äôt feel like a full action game to me, but kind of more like an MMO, with its casting times, cooldowns, and behind-the-scenes math happening,‚Äù writes Casey DeFreitas.</p> <p>Like everyone else, <a href="https://www.cnet.com/tech/gaming/pokemon-legends-z-a-hands-on-trying-out-real-time-and-mega-evolution-fights/"><em>CNET</em> demoed</a> the game on <a href="https://kotaku.com/nintendo-switch-2-impressions-launch-games-comparison-1851785748">Switch 2 in docked mode</a> and noticed ‚Äúno performance hiccups.‚Äù Nevertheless, <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/pokemon/pokemon-legends-z-a-hands-on-with-overhauled-battles-and-denser-exploration-im-shocked-at-how-fundamentally-fresh-this-could-feel/"><em>Gamesradar</em> was</a> underwhelmed by the urban playground <em>Pok√©mon Legends: Z-A</em>&nbsp; takes place in ‚ÄúThe streets and rooftops are bare and lack personality and, while appearing to be a bustling metropolis, Lumiose City is strangely quiet. The limited character animations are also quite noticeable,‚Äù writes Michael Leri. ‚ÄúIt does make me wonder if the game is underwhelming in these areas because<em> Z-A</em> is still chained to the archaic original Switch compared to its more powerful successor.‚Äù</p> <p>While <em>Pok√©mon Legends: Z-A</em> might still be visually hemmed in by the franchise‚Äôs history, it sounds like the city‚Äôs map still shows it being densely packed with points of interest. Combined with reworked moves to cater to the real-time flow of combat and mechanics like collecting orbs of energy in fights to trigger your own Pok√©mon‚Äôs Mega Evolutions, it feels like at the very least, this year‚Äôs release, the first new one in three years, is taking some fresh risks.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              
              <p>Once more unto the breach. Morning Checkpoint, <em>Kotaku‚Äôs</em> daily round-up of news, interesting stuff, and more, is here. This morning we‚Äôre looking at a second screen for the Switch 2 and a wider Steam, we‚Äôve got good news about that new <em>Mafia</em> game, and the devs behind<em> Battlefield 6</em> are making some changes to the beta. Oh, and don‚Äôt worry, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hspBUfY8IKs">we‚Äôre getting a new video game based on <em>Chicken Run</em></a>. I know everyone was waiting for that.</p> <h2><strong>Rush in the <em>BF6</em> open beta isn‚Äôt a great experience</strong></h2> <p>The<a href="https://kotaku.com/oh-thank-god-the-battlefield-6-open-beta-is-back-2000617797"><em> Battlefield 6</em> open beta is back for its second and final weekend</a>, and that‚Äôs great. This weekend also sees a new mode join the fun, Rush, which is a classic <em>BF</em> mode. Sadly, Rush in the beta is bad. I played a few matches last night and didn‚Äôt enjoy it. Maps are too small, points are too close, and attackers are at a big disadvantage when trying to blow up the MCOM stations.</p> <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">MCOM Timer Changes to Rush</p> <p>We've just made a change to Rush: the MCOM timer is now reduced from 45 to 30 seconds to better the balance between attacking and defending players.</p> <p>We‚Äôll continue to monitor and are ready and able to make further balance adjustments.</p> <p>‚Äî Battlefield Comms (@BattlefieldComm) <a href="https://twitter.com/BattlefieldComm/status/1956257348684583143?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">August 15, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <p>EA seems to get that Rush isn‚Äôt working, and a few hours after the beta went live, <a href="https://x.com/BattlefieldComm/status/1956257348684583143">the team changed how long it takes to blow up an MCOM station with a bomb</a>. Previously, it took 45 seconds, which gave defenders plenty of time to run in and defuse it. Now it takes 30 seconds, which should help. But if this mode is going to join my rotation in the full game in October, more changes will have to be made.</p>

 <h2><strong>Steam game pages are getting wider&nbsp;</strong></h2> <p>Don‚Äôt be alarmed if soon store pages on Steam look a bit wider. <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/groups/steamworks/announcements/detail/532106189043925406">Valve is testing out some new options</a> for developers and publishers that will let them customize and alter how store pages for games look on the popular digital storefront. Valve is also testing out the option to let devs upload high-quality videos to the store page instead of just gifs. Hopefully this makes store pages look nicer and doesn‚Äôt turn Steam into a giant mess.</p> <h2><strong><em>Mafia: The Old Country</em> is selling really well</strong></h2> <p>2K‚Äôs linear action game <em><a href="https://kotaku.com/mafia-old-country-review-is-it-good-worth-playing-2000617529">Mafia: The Old Country</a></em>&nbsp;has received fairly good reviews and seems to be a hit with fans of the franchise. But more importantly for the bean counters at 2K, the new <em>Mafia</em> sequel, which is actually set before all the other games in the series, is selling like hotcakes. <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/vginsights_mafiatheoldcountry-hangar13-2k-activity-7361305503299186688-QyHf/">According to some data shared by Sensor Tower</a>, <em>The Old Country</em> has already sold 800,000 units in just two weeks. PS5 and PC are the biggest platforms for the game. Hopefully this is good news for Hangar 13, and they can avoid layoffs.</p> <h2><strong><em>Hardspace: Shipbreaker</em> devs now own the franchise</strong></h2> <p><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1161580/view/836099892906557718?l=english">On August 14</a> Blackbird Interactive, developers behind spaceship salvage sim <em>Hardspace: Shipbreaker,</em> announced that it had bought back the rights to the game and the franchise from publisher Focus Entertainment. The devs also announced that they were now working on multiple projects within the <em>Hardspace</em> universe and promised a small <em>Shipbreaker</em> update in the future that will tweak some things to reflect the new ownership.</p>

 <p>‚ÄúWe‚Äôre eternally grateful for [Focus Entertainment‚Äôs] partnership and willingness to work with us so we could take ownership of the <em>Hardspace</em> IP,‚Äù said Blackbird Interactive.</p> <h2><strong>WNBA stars will be able to play with NBA stars in <em>2K26</em></strong></h2> <p>While women players from the WNBA have been a part of the <em>NBA 2K</em> series for a few years now, the latest game in the franchise will let them compete against NBA stars for the first time ever. <a href="https://nba.2k.com/2k26/courtside-report/myteam/">This will be possible only in <em>NBA 2K‚Äô</em>s popular (and profitable) MyTeam mode</a>. The women players will be available in all MyTeam game modes.</p> <h2><strong>Wait a minute, is that a Switch 2 dual-screen patent?&nbsp;</strong></h2> <p>People have spotted what appears to be a new patent from Nintendo for a dual-screen attachment or accessory for the Nintendo Switch 2. Of course, companies patent all sorts of stuff and then never do anything with it. So don‚Äôt expect Nintendo to announce this tomorrow, next month, or ever.
