              <p>Last year, a trailer leaked for a cancelled multiplayer<a href="https://kotaku.com/spider-man-pc-port-august-2022-ps4-ps5-steam-sony-plays-1849011465"><em> Spider-Man</em> game</a> that was being developed by Insomniac. It seemed cool. So cool in fact, that it seems to have inspired folks to try and use mods to make online web-swinging with friends a reality. And one such mod is now out, and it looks great.</p> <p>On August 26, <a href="https://comicbook.com/gaming/news/marvels-spider-man-co-op-multiplayer-mod-pc/">as spotted by <em>ComicBook</em></a>, a new PC-only mod has been released online that allows people to play Marvel’s <em>Spider-Man Remastered</em> with up to six other players. The mod was developed by <a href="https://www.patreon.com/hbgda">modder hbgda and is available to those who subscribe to the creator’s Patreon</a>. You can see what the mod looks like in action below, courtesy of a video shared by popular creator Kami on TikTok and Twitter.</p> <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">Spider-Man Remastered just got a working multiplayer mod on PC and it's amazing.</p> <p>Probably the closest thing we're going to get to The Great Web. <a href="https://t.co/6FeT3JEBbz">pic.twitter.com/6FeT3JEBbz</a></p> <p>— KAMI (@Okami13_) <a href="https://twitter.com/Okami13_/status/1960452836887568680?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">August 26, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <p><a href="https://youtu.be/VqjYrZ2WvCM"> There are also multiple YouTube videos of the multiplayer <em>Spider-Man</em> mod in action</a>, and it looks surprisingly stable for something as ambitious and wild as this. Sure, it’s not perfect, but considering<em> Marvel’s Spider-Man</em> on PC was never designed to support multiplayer, let alone seven people running and swinging around the map at the same time, the fact that this mod is not only playable but looks extremely polished is incredibly impressive.</p>

 <p>Watching footage of hbgda’s mod in action has me hankering to install <em>Spider-Man</em> on my PC and try this out. It also makes me sad that we never got Insomniac’s online multiplayer Spider-Man game. <a href="https://kotaku.com/spider-man-2-the-great-web-online-co-op-game-trailer-1851329786">It was reportedly going to be called <em>Spider-Man: The Great Web</em></a> and would have involved hopping between dimensions alongside your friends. Sadly, <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2023-12-22/playstation-employees-at-insomniac-studio-fear-identity-theft-after-massive-hack">according to <em>Bloomberg’s</em> Jason Schreier</a>, the game was canceled long before the trailer for it leaked in 2024 in the wake of the December 2023 <a href="https://kotaku.com/insomniac-hack-wolverine-ps5-spider-man-3-venom-sony-1851120403">Insomniac data breach.</a></p> <p>While it’s very possible the game wouldn’t have had much staying power, which is a problem for a live-service video game, I would have loved to have been able to invite my pals to swing around NYC with me and cause some chaos. At the very least, I hope we see Insomniac add a multiplayer mode to a future Spider-Man game. Doesn’t have to be something elaborate, just something that looks like this mod, but which is playable on PS5, too.</p> <p>For now, if you want to swing around New York City as Spider-Man with some other Spider-People, your only option is to download this mod and set it up on your PC.</p>

              <p><span>I want to like </span><i><span>The Paper</span></i><span>, the upcoming </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/office-spin-off-first-look-the-paper-nbc-peacock-teaser-1851780331"><i><span>Office </span></i><span>spin-off premiering on Peacock</span></a><span> next month, but it sure knows how to make a bad impression. The show’s first trailer was </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/the-office-paper-trailer-peacock-release-date-oscar-2000616348"><span>miraculously devoid of jokes</span></a><span>, but I was willing to give it the benefit of the doubt and hope that its true brilliance would shine in sequences too long to come through clearly if shoved into a two-minute teaser. Well, we now have our first clip of the show, and unfortunately </span><i><span>The Paper </span></i><span>continues to come across like the work of people trying desperately to emulate </span><i><span>The Office</span></i><span> without understanding what made it work.</span></p> <p><span>The scene Peacock put out today shows Ned Sampson (Domhnall Gleeson), the new editor-in-chief for the </span><i><span>Toledo Truth-Teller</span></i><span>, trying to impress people on the newspaper’s office floor by looking like he and his staff are having a very enthusiastic meeting in one of the private rooms. Important people are watching, and Ned wants them to think that things are going swimmingly and that the team is energized and synergized. But instead of just actually having a meeting, he instructs his employees to pantomime a productive one so the suits outside will think he’s running a productive ship.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>As unfunny as it is, it works. Good for him. I hope he can follow up that content meeting with actual content. But what is the joke here? </span><i><span>The Office </span></i><span>had absurd sequences that lasted long enough to be uncomfortable, but they were laced with one-liners, had pointed criticism of its office of assholes, or at least made you cringe from second-hand embarrassment. This whole charade doesn’t go anywhere. It’s just a couple of people being confused, most of the group playing along, and a suit being successfully hoodwinked. No punchline.</span></p> <p><iframe loading="lazy" title="The Paper | New Series Sneak Peek | Peacock Original" width="500" height="281" src="about:blank" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen="" data-rocket-lazyload="fitvidscompatible" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/xbuaBS3LtWA?feature=oembed"></iframe></p> <p><i><span>The Paper</span></i><span>’s 10-episode season premieres next week on September 4, and I really hope that Peacock is just holding back the good stuff. I don’t need the spin-off to be exactly the same as the original, but it would be nice if it didn’t feel so sauceless. </span></p>

              <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/overwatch-2-wuyang-trial-trailer-story-gameplay-voice-2000616929"><i><span>Overwatch 2</span></i><span>’s 18th season</span></a><span> began this week, and it’s overhauling every hero’s Perks. These are buffs and tweaks to each character’s abilities that the player chooses between over the course of a match. Cassidy, the gunslingin’ cowboy of the roster, has a pretty packed season between his new fire-based mythic weapon and being the face of the </span><a href="https://x.com/PlayOverwatch/status/1960039614049059292"><span>Luka Dončić collaboration event</span></a><span>, but his greatest boon is that his new perk is absolutely busted.</span></p> <p><span>One of Cassidy’s new perks is called Silver Bullet, and it replaces his rapid-fire “Fan the Hammer” secondary fire with a piercing shot that inflicts Bleed on its target. So not only does it shoot through enemies, but it inflicts damage over time on them as well. You can also zoom in when using it for more precision, which is always helpful for a hitscan hero. Its cooldown resets when you use his dodge roll, so you can pop these suckers off in rapid succession and do some real damage. Combine it with his mythic weapon Blazing Sun and you’ve got a fireworks show going on over the payload. However, it looks like it might be busted, as players found that if you press both primary and secondary fire at the same time, the damage is doubled.</span></p> <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">So there is a bug with silver bullet that if you aim it and like instantly cancel it with roll and shoot in quick succession it does like double the damage it's supposed to <a href="https://t.co/QyNcbfmSQk">pic.twitter.com/QyNcbfmSQk</a></p> <p>— Kaladin (@KaladinMeow) <a href="https://twitter.com/KaladinMeow/status/1960502342706717042?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">August 27, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <p><span>Fans are calling this latest patch one of </span><i><span>Overwatch 2</span></i><span>’s buggiest, but I guess when you’re overhauling a system like Perks there’s bound to be stuff that falls through the cracks. Wrecking Ball, the mech-piloting hamster tank, has been temporarily removed from standard play while Blizzard </span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Overwatch/comments/1n0ylfz/comment/navcxot/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button"><span>fixes a game-breaking bug</span></a><span> that gave him too much momentum when moving while grappled to an object, and Hazard is able to use his block ability forever, rather than having to stop for a cooldown as he’s supposed to.</span></p>    <p><span>As indicated by the comments on @mi7supp’s video above, some players are reporting issues with Venture and Ashe as well. Hopefully Blizzard will have these squashed in the coming days. While it’s not a great start to the season, </span><i><span>Overwatch 2 </span></i><span>has a lot going on in season 18, including a </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/overwatch-2-season-18-persona-collaboration-skins-joker-2000619195"><i><span>Persona </span></i><span>collaboration</span></a><span> that will add new skins and cosmetics based on Atlus’ high school social sim RPGs.</span></p>
