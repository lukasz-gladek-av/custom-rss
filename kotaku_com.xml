              <p>Forza Horizon 5 hit the PlayStation 5 storefront earlier this year. You best dip in to experience one of the best racing games of the generation. And if you want to make the experience extra special, get yourself the right tool to make it feel like you’re really behind the wheel—because you’re really be behind the wheel. A wheel. The Logitech G923 racing wheel and pedals for PlayStation consoles, PC, and Mac is heavily discounted at the moment. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6381/">The pair is normally sold for $400 at Amazon, but right now, it’s been brought down by 30%.</a> That cuts out a whole $130, bringing the price to just $280 for a limited time.</p>
<p>Not on PlayStation yourself? You’re an Xbox kid? Say no more. Amazon also has the same Logitech G923 racing wheel and pedals kit but for Xbox consoles.&nbsp; If you’re on PC, you get your pick of the litter. Either model will work for you. Just decide which you like better. Xbox’s AXYB setup, or PlayStation’s X, square, circle, triangle setup.</p>
<p>This racing kit is designed for ultra-realism. It’s all built out of premium materials. Brushed metal wheel with a hand-stitched black leather cover and polished metal petals.&nbsp; That’s nicer than what the wheel of my actual car looks like.</p>

<h2>Fully Immersive Racing</h2>
<p>You need the weight of a real wheel in your hand to translate to full immersion with your racing game. Your movements are processed by the wheel at 4,000 times per second, ensuring you have the best control over your in-game car, and the provide feedback through the hardware to make it feel like you’re really putting rubber to the pavement. You’ll feel every little bump along the racetrack like you would in the seat of a real race car.</p>
<p>The wheel has a programmable dual clutch, allowing you to kick out of the starting line clean and fast. It simulates a real race car launch assist when playing with games that support it.</p>



<p>The pedals are pressure sensitive, allowing you to brake slowly or immediately like you would driving a real vehicle.</p>
<p>The levels of force feedback and wheel sensitivity is fully customizable. You can make any tweak you need from major to minor right in the Logitech G Hub app, which can be launched with one button press on the controller.</p>
<p>Now, pockets of the gaming community love to get their hands on weird controllers to speed run notoriously difficult games with them. Folks have become Elden Lord on a DDR pad or slain Crota with a Rock Band drum set. Are you one of these gamers? Maybe you can be the first to dethrone Grandmother Silk with a racing wheel and pedal kit. Just got to set your mind to it.</p>
