To convince people to buy a PlayStation 5, Sony’s new ad announces that the PS5 Slim Digital Edition will be marked down to $380. </p><p>Normally, a <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://direct.playstation.com/en-us/buy-consoles/playstation5-digital-edition-console-model-group-slim&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://direct.playstation.com/en-us/buy-consoles/playstation5-digital-edition-console-model-group-slim" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">PlayStation 5 Slim Digital Edition costs $450</a></span>. So this is a discount of $70. (I’m not factoring in things like shipping, tax, etc.) This new temporary discount, which ends on December 24, means that you can now buy a PS5 Slim and a digital game while paying about the same (or less) than you would normally for a game and a new PS5. That’s nice. </p><p>However, keep in mind that this deal is only on the PS5 Slim Digital Edition. So if you want a PS5 with a disc drive, you’ll have to either buy that console or buy a disc drive separately. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/ps5-pro-disc-drive-cost-selling-out-where-to-buy-amazon-1851646276&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/ps5-pro-disc-drive-cost-selling-out-where-to-buy-amazon-1851646276">And uh, good luck with that</a></span>. It should also be noted that the Slim doesn’t come with a vertical stand. You’ll need to buy that separately.</p><p>Finally, let’s not forget that when the digital-only PS5 initially launched, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/ps5-out-in-u-s-on-nov-12-costs-500-for-main-model-1845081999&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/ps5-out-in-u-s-on-nov-12-costs-500-for-main-model-1845081999">it was just $400.</a></span> Then, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/sony-playstation-ps5-slim-all-digital-disc-drive-price-1850914803&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/sony-playstation-ps5-slim-all-digital-disc-drive-price-1850914803">Sony raised its price after the launch</a></span>. So when you factor that in, this means the PS5 Slim that Sony is selling during the holidays is only $20 less than it was four years ago. Bleh. </p><p>Also, this deal doesn’t apply to the recently released <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/ps5-pro-price-disc-drive-sony-why-1851657354?_gl=1*rhztje*_ga*MzQzNjkwNDM2LjE2NDY2NjQ1NzQ.*_ga_V4QNJTT5L0*MTczMTQyMDM2Mi4xMDMuMS4xNzMxNDMwODY4LjQ2LjAuMA..&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/ps5-pro-price-disc-drive-sony-why-1851657354?_gl=1*rhztje*_ga*MzQzNjkwNDM2LjE2NDY2NjQ1NzQ.*_ga_V4QNJTT5L0*MTczMTQyMDM2Mi4xMDMuMS4xNzMxNDMwODY4LjQ2LjAuMA..">PS5 Pro, which still costs an eye-watering $700</a></span>. It might be Christmastime, but Sony ain’t discounting its newest and most expensive console anytime soon. Do you want ray tracing this holiday season? You gotta pay up. </p><p> .<br></p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

They include Switch bundles, $20 to $30 off games ranging from <em>Super Mario Odyssey</em> to <em>Animal Crossing: New Horizons</em>, and discounted controllers. Here’s the full list so far:</p><blockquote data-type="BlockQuote"><p><strong>Hardware</strong></p></blockquote><blockquote data-type="BlockQuote"><ul data-type="List" data-style="Bullet"><li> Switch <em>Mario Kart 8 Deluxe</em> Bundle - $300 (normally $380)</li><li>Switch OLED <em>Mario Kart 8 Deluxe</em> Bundle - $350 (normally $430)</li><li>Switch Lite Hyrule Edition w/ Online + Expansion Pack - $210 (normally $250) </li></ul><p><strong>Games</strong></p><ul data-type="List" data-style="Bullet"><li><em>The Legend of Zeld: Tears of the Kingdom</em> - $50 (normally $70)</li><li><em>Super Mario Maker 2</em> - $40 (normally $60)</li><li><em>Animal Crossing: New Horizons - </em>$40 (normally $60)</li><li><em>Pikmin 4</em> - $40 (normally $60)</li><li><em>Nintendo Switch Sports - </em>$40 (normally $60)</li><li><em>Kirby and the Forgotten Land</em> - $40 (normally $60)</li><li><em>﻿Super Mario Odyssey </em>- $30 (normally $60)</li><li><em>Pikmin 1 + 2 </em>- $30 (normally $60)</li></ul><p><strong>Accessories</strong></p><ul data-type="List" data-style="Bullet"><li> Neon Red and Neon Blue Joy-Con controllers - $60 (normally $80)</li><li>Switch Pro Controller - $50 (normally $70)</li><li><em>Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom</em> Switch Carrying Case - $15 (normally $25)</li></ul></blockquote><p>As has become something of a seasonal tradition, the <em>Mario Kart 8 Deluxe</em> bundle is back in pole position, with both base Switch and OLED variants that essentially include the hit party racing game for free as well as a year of Switch Online. The Expansion Pack portion is missing though, which is a shame since that’s what includes access to all of the <em>Mario Kart 8 DLC </em>for free (otherwise it’s $30 extra).</p><p>In fact, Nintendo is pushing Switch Online memberships big-time as part of its Black Friday deals this year. The Hyrule Edition Switch Lite, which looks fantastic, will be bundled with a year of Switch Online + Expansion Pack for $40 off. The subscription includes access to dozens of games from the NES, SNES, Nintendo 64, Game Boy, Game Boy Advance, and Sega Genesis libraries. </p><p>When it comes to games, there’s no noteworthy deals on anything that got released this year or even in late 2023 like <em>Super Mario Bros. Wonder</em> or<em> Super Mario RPG</em>. Then again, $20 off <em>Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom</em> isn’t bad by Nintendo’s normally stingy standards. While it never got DLC, the game’s world is so massive, it still essentially feels like a forever game. I have over 100 hours in it and still haven’t seen everything. </p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
