              <p><span>Rockstar Games has just launched the Cfx Marketplace, described as “a curated digital storefront” which will allow a select group of creators “to share and sell” mods for both </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/grand-theft-auto-5-gta-6-mod-ai-npc-legal-youtube-1850749678"><i><span>Grand Theft Auto V</span></i></a><span> and </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/red-dead-redemption-2-mod-video-npc-memories-blurbs-2000631070"><i><span>Red Dead Redemption II</span></i></a><span>.</span><span><br> </span><span><br> </span><span>Rockstar Games, and by extension its parent company Take-Two Interactive, has a harsh and often litigious relationship with its modding community. Although the developer has never truly been supportive of modding efforts for its games, Rockstar’s laser-focused approach to issuing </span><i><span>GTA</span></i><span>-related takedown notices took root in 2019, following a string of DMCA takedowns for mods on both ModDB and GTA5-Mods.</span><span><br> </span><span><br> </span><span>As a user on the </span><a href="https://gtaforums.com/topic/974338-take-two-vs-the-gta-modding-community-2021-ee-edition/#comments"><span>GTA Forums explained</span></a><span>, this new wave of takedown notices was attributed to a change in Rockstar Games’ user agreement in 2019 that banned modding, while the previous 2017 agreement had no such provision. (That previous user agreement has since been “excluded from the wayback machine” and therefore can no longer be found online.)</span></p> <figure id="attachment_2000659827" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000659827"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000659827">Rockstar Games / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p><span><br> </span><span>Since then, Take-Two’s legal team has been ruthless in their legal pursuits against a string of </span><i><span>Grand Theft Auto </span></i><span>mods. In 2025 alone, the mod teams behind </span><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/gta-5-liberty-city-preservation-project-shut-down/"><span>Liberty City Preservation Project</span></a><span> (a mod which transplanted </span><i><span>GTA IV’s</span></i><span> map into </span><i><span>GTA V</span></i><span>), a </span><a href="https://www.tomshardware.com/video-games/browser-run-copy-of-grand-theft-auto-gets-taken-down-by-dcma-take-two-says-dos-zone-infringed-companys-intellectual-property-rights-despite-disclaimers-and-requirement-to-own-original-copy-of-title-to-run-full-game-online"><span>web browser port</span></a><span> of </span><i><span>GTA: Vice City</span></i><span>, and </span><a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/playable-gta-6-map-mod-project-vice-is-no-more-following-take-two-copyright-strike"><span>Project Vice</span></a><span> (which modded </span><i><span>Grand Theft Auto VI’s</span></i><span> leaked map data into </span><i><span>GTA V</span></i><span>) were all issued DMCA takedown notices by Take-Two Interactive.</span><span><br> </span><span><br> </span><span>However, in spite of all this, Rockstar Games announced an exception to their “policy on mods” in 2022, following the ever-growing popularity of Cfx.re’s </span><i><span>Grand Theft Auto V</span></i><span> and </span><i><span>Red Dead Redemption II</span></i><span> roleplay servers FiveM and RedM. Then, in 2023, Rockstar Games revealed </span><a href="https://www.rockstargames.com/newswire/article/8971o8789584a4/roleplay-community-update"><span>that Cfx.re was</span></a><span> “now officially a part of Rockstar Games.”</span><span><br> </span><span><br> </span><span>Funnily enough, in 2015, Rockstar Games banned the Rockstar Social Club accounts of several of the members behind FiveM. Rockstar Games then </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/rockstar-allegedly-bans-modders-for-making-alternative-1723093679"><span>issued an official statement</span></a><span> which explained that the FiveM project “is an unauthorized alternate multiplayer service that contains code designed to facilitate piracy.”</span></p>

 <h2>The <em>GTA</em>&nbsp;mods will be monetized</h2> <p><a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/rockstar-launches-official-marketplace-for-mods"><span>Earlier this week</span></a><span> on January 12, Cfx announced the </span><a href="https://forum.cfx.re/t/introducing-the-cfx-marketplace/5369289"><span>Cfx Marketplace</span></a><span>, which they described as “a curated digital storefront where talented FiveM/RedM creators can share and sell their work.” Although the marketplace is clearly aimed at </span><i><span>GTA V</span></i><span> and </span><i><span>RDR II</span></i><span> server owners, the official news post states that “there’s something for every server and every player,” including “purchasable props, scripts, maps, and much more.”</span><span><br> </span><span><br> </span><span>The marketplace features a handful of mods that are free to download, as well as mods that require a </span><a href="https://marketplace.cfx.re/packages/6187491-onx-eup-police-ems-clothing-pack"><span>$23.99 recurring monthly fee</span></a><span> and bundles that cost </span><a href="https://marketplace.cfx.re/packages/6187491-onx-eup-police-ems-clothing-pack"><span>upwards of $467.99</span></a><span>. For the time being, Cfx has only partnered with a “select group” of modders for its initial launch. It’s also not clear exactly how much of a cut Take-Two Interactive is getting from these purchases.</span><span><br> </span><span><br> </span><span>It could be argued that the creation of the Cfx Marketplace is Rockstar Games’ attempt at providing a space for server owners to find mods that are immune to takedown notices, as, according to commenters on Cfx’s news post, dozens of paid, non-Rockstar-authorized mods have been banned in the past for featuring third-party assets.</span><span><br> </span><span><br> </span><span>The timing is also somewhat suspicious, as this “initial launch” looks a lot like a trial run for a </span><i><span>Grand Theft Auto VI</span></i><span> mod marketplace to me. I’d also be curious to find out exactly how much of a cut, if any, Rockstar Games and Take-Two are getting from these purchases, although said information is seemingly absent from any of the official Cfx Marketplace news posts.</span></p>

            <title><![CDATA[Forza Horizon 6 Will Take Fans To Japan Soon According To New Leak]]></title>
            <link>https://kotaku.com/forza-horizon-6-leak-release-date-may-xbox-direct-2026-ps5-japan-2000659807</link>
            <guid>1405858</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Next week, <em>Forza Horizon 6</em> is set to be one of the main focuses of Xbox’s upcoming Dev Direct Showcase. But thanks to an in-game leak, we don’t have to wait until then to find out when the open-world racer will launch. And thankfully, we’ll be speeding around Japan soon when <em>Horizon 6</em> arrives in May.</p> <p>On January 14, <a href="https://x.com/XBOXF10/status/2011429719800180925/photo/1">Xbox Infinite</a>, an Xbox news account based in Saudi Arabia, posted a screenshot on Twitter of what it claims to be an ad for <em>Forza Horizon 6</em> that popped up ahead of schedule. The ad claims that <a href="https://kotaku.com/forza-horizon-6-location-microsoft-tokyo-game-show-2000628658"><em>Forza Horizon 6, </em>which was officially announced in September 2025,</a>&nbsp;will be available to play four days early, on May 15, for those who pre-order the Premium Edition of the game. This implies that <em>Horizon 6</em>‘s actual release date is May 19. <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/forza-horizon-6s-release-date-may-have-been-revealed-early-by-an-in-game-ad/"><em>VGC</em> reports</a> that its sources have confirmed this release window as accurate.</p>

 <p>“Discover the breathtaking landscapes of Japan in over 550 real-world cars and become a racing Legend in <em>Forza Horizon’</em>s biggest open world driving adventure yet,” reads text included in the ad. Here’s the list of what else you get for pre-ordering the Premium Edition, according to this leaked promo:</p>

 <blockquote><p>• Early Access – Play 4 days early, starting May 15<br> • VIP Membership<br> • Welcome Pack<br> . Car Pass<br> • Time Attack Car Pack<br> • Italian Passion Car Pack (coming post-launch)<br> • 2 Premium Expansions (coming post-launch)</p></blockquote> <p><a href="https://x.com/XBOXF10/status/2011452908550926481">According to Xbox Infinite,</a> the leaked ad appeared as they were playing a different <em>Forza</em> game. <em>Kotaku</em> can’t confirm if the ad is real, but we’ve seen things like this before, and <em>VGC</em> corroborating the release window seems to verify this is a real leak.</p>

 <p>It also makes sense that it popped up now, just a week before the Dev Direct event. Some wires got crossed, it seems, but we can likely expect the release date and more to be confirmed on January 22 at the showcase. Also expected at the event is <em>Pokémon</em> studio <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/pokemon-developer-game-freak-reveals-beast-of-reincarnation-at-xbox-games-showcase">GameFreak’s AAA action RPG </a><em>Beast of Reincarnation,</em> as well as a deep dive into the oft-delayed <em>Fable</em> reboot. <em>Forza Horizon 6</em> is launching on Xbox, PC, and Game Pass, with a PS5 port rumored to arrive at a later date.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[A Detail About GTA 6′s Super Secret Multiplayer Just Got Accidentally Revealed]]></title>
            <link>https://kotaku.com/gta-6-multiplayer-one-detail-leak-court-docs-player-count-32-rockstar-2000659780</link>
            <guid>1405855</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>We’ve learned a new detail about <em>Grand Theft Auto 6′</em>s multiplayer via the ongoing court case over <a href="https://kotaku.com/gta-6-rockstar-games-union-busting-delay-2000640525">Rockstar Games’ firing of over two dozen employees</a>, despite the <em>GTA</em> maker’s lawyer trying to keep the info secret.</p> <p>While Rockstar has started to share more information about <a href="https://kotaku.com/gta-6-release-date-red-dead-2-2000658151"><em>Grand Theft Auto 6</em></a>, launching this November, it has basically said nothing about the upcoming open-world game’s multiplayer mode. Following the massive success of <em>GTA Online, GTA 6</em> will likely feature a similar, possibly bigger, online spin-off. But what that will look like, how it will work, and when to expect it (<em>GTA Online</em> launched a few weeks after <em>GTA V</em>), well, we have no idea. But hey, at least I can confirm to you that <em>GTA 6</em>‘s online mode will support at least 32 players.</p> <p>This new, tiny detail comes from the ongoing court case between Rockstar Games and over two dozen employees it fired back in October 2025. The company claims they were let go after sharing confidential information in a Discord server. The devs and the Independent Workers’ Union of Great Britain claim it was an act of union-busting. <a href="https://kotaku.com/rockstar-wins-initial-ruling-against-fired-gta-6-devs-we-regret-that-we-were-put-in-a-position-where-dismissals-were-necessary-2000658984">On Monday</a>, an employment tribunal in the UK ruled that Rockstar won’t have to pay fired employees back pay during the case. But during this hearing, as reported by <em><a href="https://youtu.be/dnuipPQDd_w">People Make Games</a>,</em> Rockstar was forced to share some of the messages from the devs, which included a detail about<em> GTA 6′</em>s online mode that Rockstar’s legal spokesperson wasn’t comfortable reading out loud because it was extremely confidential.</p>

  <p>In October, one fired employee sent a message in Discord claiming Rockstar didn’t want more than five people taking time off for any reason, as it made it harder to fill playtest sessions of the online mode with 32 players. “Not sure how that was difficult,” added the developer, as seen in court docs by <em>PMG</em>. Someone else replied: “Sounds like you have multiple studios of QA testers, surely someone can manage to organise a 32 player session and let people have their time off.”</p>

 <p>And that’s it.&nbsp;<span>As I mentioned, it’s not a significant detail and not surprising either, as&nbsp;<em>GTA Online</em> currently supports 32 players online (30 players and</span> 2 spectators).&nbsp; And we also don’t know for certain if <em>GTA 6</em>‘s online mode will support exactly 32 players at release, or if other modes, like a possible freeroam mode, might support even more or fewer players. Still, it is a detail about <em>GTA 6</em>‘s barely-talked-about multiplayer mode that Rockstar was apparently so determined to keep hidden that it got nervous about it in court and allegedly fired someone over sharing it in a Discord chat.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><span><a href="https://kotaku.com/everything-you-need-to-know-animal-crossing-kappn-update-switch-2-2000654252"><em>Animal Crossing: New Horizons’</em> 3.0 update</a> is out now—a day earlier than expected for many players. While the free update is out now, the Nintendo Switch 2 upgrade is still unavailable, and likely won’t be out until that version’s official release date of January 15.</span></p> <p><span>The reason the 3.0 update dropped early is assumed to be because it’s already January 15 in certain time zones, like New Zealand. The paid Switch 2 upgrade, though, is seemingly tied to timing in different regions; once it hits midnight where you are, it’ll be available for purchase. To access the free update, just update your <em>Animal Crossing: New Horizons</em> game from the Switch homepage. Once the game launches, you’ll know the update is live because Isabelle will shout out the new hotel opening.</span></p>

 <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">Animal Crossing: New Horizons Version 3.0 is NOW AVAILABLE for download on Nintendo Switch &amp; Nintendo Switch 2! 🎉 🎉 🎉 <a href="https://t.co/ukHHOS1HJC">pic.twitter.com/ukHHOS1HJC</a></p> <p>— Animal Crossing World 🏝️ (@ACWorldBlog) <a href="https://twitter.com/ACWorldBlog/status/2011394946977149116?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 14, 2026</a></p></blockquote>  <p><span>Fans have been prepping for months ahead of the content update, which was announced late last year. The announcement itself was a huge surprise—Nintendo’s 2.0 update was the last major release in 2021, and was widely expected to be the last update for the game. The new update adds a bunch of new content, like the Kapp’n family hotel, located on the pier. </span></p>

 <p><span>But players are also </span><span>excited for quality-of-life updates that make the whole experience better, like bulk crafting and the <a href="https://kotaku.com/animal-crossing-3-0-update-prep-restart-island-resetti-2000658987">Resetti clean-up service</a> for quickly resetting portions of the island. The Switch 2 upgrade uses the new console’s hardware capabilities to support mouse controls and larger multiplayer groups.&nbsp;</span></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><span>Though we’re getting further and further away from the release of </span><i><span>Stranger Things</span></i><span>’ </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/stranger-things-season-5-finale-reaction-byler-acting-2000656424"><span>divisive final season</span></a><i><span>, </span></i><span>fan scrutiny, speculation, and criticism only seems to be getting turned up, with one of the latest narratives being that creators the Duffer Brothers used ChatGPT to write the finale that’s got a subset of fans so mad, they’re crossing their fingers for </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/stranger-things-conformity-gate-secret-netflix-crash-2000658155"><span>a secret finale that will fix it all</span></a><span>. Now the director of the documentary that inadvertently gave rise to these accusations has offered her own comment on them, and although she may have intended to dismiss any such concerns, her words are unlikely to have that effect.</span></p> <p><span>The genAI accusations were born out of a shot in the </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/stranger-things-season-5-documentary-chatgpt-reddit-2000659351"><i><span>One Last Adventure </span></i><span>documentary </span></a><span>about the making of the final season in which some fans believed they saw tabs for the chatbot open in a web browser while the Duffers were working on the script. </span><a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/tv/tv-features/stranger-things-5-documentary-director-interview-chatgpt-1236472338/"><i><span>The Hollywood Reporter</span></i></a> <span>interviewed documentary director Martina Radwan about the two-hour film, and naturally, the topic of these ChatGPT rumors came up. In the ensuing exchange, Radwan doesn’t confirm or deny the allegations that the Duffers used ChatGPT as a writing tool, but her comments probably won’t help quell the notion.</span></p>

 <p><span>Interviewer Tony Maglio asks Radwan point blank if she’s aware of any ChatGPT use by the Duffers while they were writing the </span><i><span>Stranger Things </span></i><span>season 5 scripts, and she pretty unambiguously says “no.” The lead-up to that answer, though, is…well, let’s just read it.</span></p>

 <blockquote><p><span>Maglio: You’ve got super fans pausing and zooming in on individual frames of your documentary. One allegedly shows one of the Duffers with a ChatGPT tab open on their computer. Did they use ChatGPT in your presence, and if so, what for?</span></p> <p><span>Radwan: I mean, are we even sure they had ChatGPT open?</span></p> <p><span>Maglio: I’m personally not, but the internet seems sure.</span></p> <p><span>Radwan: Well, there’s a lot of chatter where [social media users] are like, “We don’t really know, but we’re assuming.” But to me it’s like, doesn’t everybody have it open, to just do quick research?</span></p> <p><span>Maglio: I do.</span></p> <p><span>Radwan: How can you possibly write a storyline with 19 characters and use ChatGPT, I don’t even understand.</span></p> <p><span>Maglio: I don’t think many fans truly believe the Duffers had gen-AI write their scripts, I think it’s more of an aversion to the use of the technology in general in Hollywood.</span></p> <p><span>Radwan: Again, first of all, nobody has actually proved that it was open. That’s like having your iPhone next to your computer while you’re writing a story. We just use these tools … while multitasking. So there’s a lot going on all the time, every time. What I find heartbreaking is everybody loves the show, and suddenly we need to pick it apart.</span></p> <p><span>Maglio: So just to button-up the topic: You didn’t witness an unethical use of generative-AI in the writers room?</span></p> <p><span>Radwan: No, of course not. I witnessed creative exchanges. I witnessed conversation. People think “writers room” means people are sitting there writing. No, it’s a creative exchange. It’s story development. And, of course, you go places in your creative mind and then you come back [to the script]. I think being in the writers room is such a privilege and such a gift to be able to witness that.</span></p></blockquote> <p><span>Radwan asking, “Doesn’t everybody have [ChatGPT] open?” has </span><a href="https://x.com/SThingsMeme/status/2011358226487582816?s=20"><span>put off a lot of people</span></a><span>, both in and out of the </span><i><span>Stranger Things </span></i><span>online drama. Because, no, we don’t all have ChatGPT open. I’ve never used the thing, and neither have a lot of people. Some of us don’t need a chatbot to tell them how to write, think, or do their research for them. Radwan is still adamant that she never saw the Duffers using ChatGPT to write the script, but the implication that they were using the tech at all is still just ammunition some can use against a finale they didn’t like.</span></p>

 <p><span>Even if the Duffer Brothers were to look into a camera and swear up and down they didn’t use ChatGPT, I don’t know that it would be enough for some of the more conspiratorial </span><i><span>Stranger Things </span></i><span>fans who are now </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/stranger-things-season-5-finale-matt-duffer-interview-2000656663"><span>taking pretty much any potshot</span></a><span> they can at the show. </span></p>
