              <p>PC gamers know that the hunt for the best processors for their rigs usually boils down to speed and cores, and they also know an unlocked processor can be pushed beyond its factory-set limits for maximum performance. A sneaky-good unlocked gaming processor just hit Amazon’s sale shelf — <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6341/">the AMD Ryzen 7 5800XT, an unlocked chip ready to be overclocked, is just $183 after a 27% price drop.</a></p>
<p>The next-gen chips bring fatter spec sheets and sexier reviews, but the 5800XT’s 8 cores and 16 threads built on AMD’s proven-winner Zen 3 platform brings a base clock speed of 3.8GHz which can be boosted all the way to 4.8GHz. It’s loaded with 32MB of L3 cache and 4MB of L2, with PCIe 4.0 support, DDR4-3200 memory compatibility, and — very important for a chip that’s going to get a ton of overclocking — AMD’s Wraith Prism cooler to prevent heat-related failure.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6341/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Second Life</h2>
<p>If you’re building your own rig from scratch, the 5800XT is a solid midrange choice to build around, and this Amazon deal makes its price virtually unbeatable. You’ll be saving hundreds of dollars by skipping the next-gen chip and still enjoying power and speed suitable for online gaming.</p>
<p>The ideal shopper for this deal, however, might be anyone with an older and slower PC who’s caught between gutting out another year or two with a subpar machine, or biting the budgetary bullet and going all-in on an all-new machine. The latter choice could run you well into the high hundreds or even low four figures. But by opting for the 5800XT for just $183 and doing a quick, easy swapout, that older machine probably gains years of new life as a much faster and more efficient gaming rig.</p>



<h2>More Than Gaming</h2>
<p>The 5800XT is listed as a gaming processor, and it definitely lives up to that label. But the 36MB of cache is impressively generous, and the 5800XT also supports DDR4-3200 memory, which means it will be able to transder data with the same great speed it games with. Data access speeds are also well above average, so whatever PC you add the 5800XT to will also be more than capable of being a productivity workhorse or media center for streaming and storage.</p>
<p>PCIe 4.0 compatibility on X570 and B550 motherboards is the final piece if the puzzle for this great Amazon deal on the Ryzen 7 5800XT processor, because it future-proofs your new build or revamped PC by giving it compatibility with next-gen components without forcing you to overspend on an entirely new machine or a next-gen processor. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6341/">This deal is the best $187 brain transplant you can perform on an older PC</a>, or the best $187 nerve center around which to build an entirely new machine from scratch.</p>

              <p>Jim Ward, sometimes know as James Kevin Ward, was a voice actor and radio host, best known for providing the wonderful voice of&nbsp;<em>Ratchet &amp; Clank</em>‘s buffoonish antihero Captain Qwark. It was <a href="https://x.com/StephMillerShow/status/1998881395167604759">announced</a> last night (via&nbsp;<a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/news/2025/12/jim-ward-voice-of-ratchet-and-clanks-captain-qwark-has-passed-away"><em>PushSquare</em></a>)&nbsp;that he has died at the age of 66.</p> <p>Jim Ward was perhaps more recently most recognized as a co-host on the nationally syndicated talk radio program,&nbsp;<em>The Stephanie Miller Show</em>, but to video games players it’s almost certainly Captain Qwark who would first come to mind. The hilarious character, all bravado and little talent, was so deftly performed by Ward such that he was<em>&nbsp;just</em> likable enough to be both a glorious antagonist, then later a hilariously useless ally, across most of the series of games.</p>

 <p>However, Ward was recognizable in so many other games, as well as his many TV and movie roles (especially as Doug Dimmadome and Chet Ubetcha in&nbsp;<em>Fairly Odd Parents</em>). In 1998 he was the voice of Hector LeMans in&nbsp;<em>Grim Fandango</em>, became a regular in multiple <em>Star Wars</em> games, appeared as <em>FEAR</em>‘s Rodney Betters,&nbsp;<em>Diablo III</em>‘s Belial, as well as roles in&nbsp;<em>Metal Gear Solid 3</em>,&nbsp;<em>Batman: Arkham Knight</em>, and&nbsp;<em>BioShock 2</em>, among many dozens of others.</p>

 <p>Ward had retired in 2021, due to a combination of precocious Alzheimer’s and an extremely serious case of covid-19 that had left him paralyzed for months. After a slow recovery from the sickness, he had entirely lost his memory. (Rather wonderfully, despite this, he apparently would still perform voices and entertain his family.) This obviously meant <a href="https://www.playstationlifestyle.net/2021/05/12/ratchet-clank-jim-ward/">he was unable to reprise his role</a> for 2021’s <em>Ratchet &amp; Clank: Rift Apart</em>, where he was replaced by <span data-testid="hero__primary-text">Scott Whyte, but his voice has continued appearing in more recent games such as&nbsp;<em>The Elder Scrolls Online</em>‘s&nbsp;<em>Gold Road</em> expansion and last year’s remaster of <em>The Thing</em>.</span></p> <p>Ward’s death was publicly announced by his former radio colleague Stephanie Miller, who quoted from an email sent to her by Ward’s wife on December 10. “One of the saddest messages I have ever received,” she began, quoting, “<span>Our wonderful ‘voice deity’ as Steph anointed Jim Ward, passed away today at 10:45AM. Can you let Steph know? Thanks, Janice.”</span></p> <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">One of the saddest messages I have ever received from the amazing Mrs Jim Ward:<br> Our wonderful “voice deity” as Steph anointed Jim Ward, passed away today at 10:45AM. Can you let Steph know? Thanks, Janice</p> <p>— Stephanie Miller (@StephMillerShow) <a href="https://twitter.com/StephMillerShow/status/1998881395167604759?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 10, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <p>RIP Jim Ward. We wish all the best to his surviving family and friends.</p>
