              <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/wordle-new-york-times-crosswords-josh-wardle-app-ios-an-1848455748"><i><span>Wordle</span></i></a><span>, the word-guessing game that has been a daily fixture in </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/new-pope-american-leo-wordle-words-with-friends-gamer-1851779977"><span>many people’s lives</span></a><span> since 2021, had a more difficult word than usual today, December 19. I don’t play </span><i><span>Wordle</span></i><span>, so I didn’t think much of it when my coworkers were chatting about how tough today’s word was. That is, until I looked outside of the </span><i><span>Kotaku </span></i><span>Slack and to the rest of the internet, where I saw that </span><i><span>Wordle</span></i><span> players were absolutely crashing out about today’s word.&nbsp;</span></p>  <p><span>The word for today is “myrrh,” which, for those who don’t know about the cool shit Jesus was given when he died, is a “fragrant gum resin obtained from various Arabian and African trees and used in perfumery, medicines, and incense.” For a lot of players, the go-to </span><i><span>Wordle</span></i><span> strategy is to start by guessing vowels as a basis and then filling in consonants based on where the vowels fall. As you can see, myrrh has no vowels, so players were already at a disadvantage. Many tried and failed to figure out the word, and it just about ruined their day.</span></p>

What I wasn’t expecting was some of the other responses I came across that we elected not to share here. I know edgy humor and wild comparisons are common in most gaming spheres, but I did not expect some of the vile shit I saw </span><i><span>Wordle </span></i><span>players calling the game’s developers. So if you’re down to see some truly off-the-wall, excessive reactions to a simple word game, you can search for that yourself.</span></p>

 <p><span>At any rate, maybe they’ll bring “myrrh” back to </span><i><span>Wordle </span></i><span>when </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/wordle-jimmy-fallon-game-show-host-nbc-savannah-guthrie-2000632667"><span>Jimmy Fallon’s game show</span></a><span> version comes along, and we’ll see someone crash out on live television.</span></p>
