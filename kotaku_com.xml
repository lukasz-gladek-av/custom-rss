It’s easy to recommend it to anyone willing to shed a tear. Though the game seems to function primarily as an allegory for pollution and protecting the planet, it can also hit particularly hard for those of us who have lost pets, as it deals with love, loss, grief, and rebirth in ways that are certain to cut you deeply if you let it. But it’s not just there to drain you. Rather, it serves as a meaningful reminder of the love and memories our companions leave behind. </p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="196663" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="The Top 10 Most Played Games On Steam Deck: February 2024 Edition" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="429" data-playlist="196663,196086,195301" data-current="196663"><div><p>The Top 10 Most Played Games On Steam Deck: February 2024 Edition</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196663/196663_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196663/196663_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196663/196663_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196663/196663_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/22220.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>As such, the game’s trophy and achievement list even asks you to complete multiple tasks related to soothing and caring for Neva, your titular wolf-like companion, throughout the game’s brief runtime. Eventually, you’ll also have the option to earn the “Memories” trophy or achievement as you begin closing out your adventure late in the game. </p><p>Unfortunately, there are no clues as to how to obtain the “Memories” trophy or achievement in <em>Neva</em>. You’re largely left to your own devices to figure it out. However, if you’d like to know where to go and how to get it, read on for a (<strong>mostly</strong>) spoiler-free explanation of where to find and complete this final optional task in the game.</p><figure id="" data-id="97ff336391ae4b9df780dab87a54f9f0" data-recommend-id="image://97ff336391ae4b9df780dab87a54f9f0" data-format="png" data-width="1600" data-height="176" data-lightbox="true" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><span data-id="97ff336391ae4b9df780dab87a54f9f0" data-recommend-id="image://97ff336391ae4b9df780dab87a54f9f0" data-format="png" data-width="1600" data-height="176" data-lightbox="true" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><h2 id="h93246"><a id=""></a>How To Get The ‘Memories’ Trophy Or Achievement In <em>Neva</em></h2><p>The “Memories” trophy or achievement can be obtained in the Spring section of <em>Neva</em>, which is the final segment of the game. Spring consists of only one short chapter, so if you’ve already completed the game, simply reload it to start it from the beginning.</p><p>You’ll have to follow your companion around for a bit, first to the left and then to the right, as you make your way through the very linear level. Eventually, you’ll come to a broken bridge. As you cross it, you can notice a large, red tree beneath. When you’re able to drop down under the bridge, do so, then head over to the red tree.</p><figure id="" data-id="86ea5504578ffb2492281c40447998f4" data-recommend-id="image://86ea5504578ffb2492281c40447998f4" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A large tree stands underneath a bridge." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A large tree stands underneath a bridge." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Nomada Studio / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="86ea5504578ffb2492281c40447998f4" data-recommend-id="image://86ea5504578ffb2492281c40447998f4" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A large tree stands underneath a bridge." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>If you stand beneath the red tree for a few moments, the camera will zoom in just a bit and Alba will begin to sing. Shortly after, you should get the notification for receiving the “Memories” trophy or achievement.</p><p>If you’ve been completing all of the other trophies or achievements throughout <em>Neva</em>, “Memories” will mark the final missable one on your journey. Just continue forward a bit further to reach the very end of the game. Grab a tissue.</p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
