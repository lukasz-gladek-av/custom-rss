              <p>Most people don’t have $2,000 sitting around for a MacBook and frankly, you might not even need that kind of firepower for everyday computing. HP’s 14-inch AI <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5460/">2025 laptop just hit an all-time low of $379 on Amazon, slashed from its usual $1,099 price tag</a>. The kicker is that <strong>Windows 11 Pro and a year of Office 365 come pre-installed</strong>, and those two software packages alone would normally cost you close to what you’re paying for the entire laptop at this discount.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5460/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>



<h2>Budget Pricing Meets Modern Computing Power</h2>
<p>The Intel N150 processor keeps things running smoothly whether you’re browsing the web, editing documents or streaming videos without the lag that’s so common in cheaper laptops. This chip isn’t going to render 4K video projects in seconds but it launches apps quickly and handles multiple browser tabs without grinding to a halt. You get responsive performance during video calls and enough processing muscle to run Office applications alongside your email and a dozen Chrome tabs.</p>
<p>This laptop features 16GB of DDR4 RAM which makes a big difference when you’re jumping between applications: you can have email open and edit a presentation while streaming music in the background, running antivirus scans, without everything slowing to a crawl. It really means that <strong>Windows 11 runs the way Microsoft intended it to</strong> with smooth transitions and instant app switching.</p>



<p>The <strong>storage setup combines 128GB of universal flash storage with a 256GB microSD card</strong> for a total of 386GB. The UFS storage handles your operating system and most used programs quickly thanks to its high read and write speeds, while the microSD card is there for documents, photos, and media files. In this way, this two-storage solution will keep your system running fast and gives you space for thousands of documents.</p>
<p>Unlike the Home edition, <strong>Windows 11 Pro includes enterprise-level security features</strong> and offers remote desktop capabilities. The Pro version lets you encrypt your hard drive with BitLocker, join corporate domains, and access your computer remotely when you’re traveling. You’ll also get Office 365, which gives you the full Microsoft productivity suite, including Word, Excel, PowerPoint, Outlook, and OneDrive cloud storage, right out of the box. That <strong>subscription generally costs $99 per year alone, while Windows 11 Pro typically adds $199 to a laptop’s sticker price so you’re basically getting the hardware for $80</strong> after accounting for the software value.</p>



<p>A dedicated <strong>AI key for Copilot puts Microsoft’s AI Assistant</strong> just a button-press away. You can ask it to draft emails for you, summarize long documents, generate creative content, and even give tips for troubleshooting without opening a browser or digging through menus. This integration speeds up the workflow when you need fast answers or want to automate repetitive tasks.</p>
<p>The Sky Blue finish adds some nice personality to what’s otherwise a sea of gray and black finishes in the market. It also saves you from having to buy peripherals separately because it includes a Redragon mouse, and it is remarkably lightweight, easy to carry from home to office or coffee shop. You get a full computing package with the $379 asking price, capable of handling daily productivity tasks, coming loaded with premium software and even putting in modern features like AI integration and Wi-Fi 6.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/lego-quietly-offloads-obi-wan-kenobis-starfighter-now-selling-for-pocket-change-on-amazon-2000643056</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/lego-quietly-offloads-obi-wan-kenobi%E2%80%99s-starfighter-now-selling-for-pocket-change-on-amazon.1350607/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>LEGO’s Star Wars line is the brick giant’s most popualr franchise but the company rarely discounts these sets on its own website. Amazon just changed the game by dropping <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5459/">Obi-Wan Kenobi’s Jedi Starfighter to an all-time low of $25, down from its regular $29 price tag</a>. This <strong>282-piece set</strong> from <em>Attack of the Clones</em> gives you the iconic blue starfighter, three minifigures including a debut character and enough playability to keep young Jedi entertained for hours.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5459/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>



<h2>A Starfighter That Delivers on All Fronts</h2>
<p>The build itself captures the <strong>sleek design of Obi-Wan’s Delta-7 Aethersprite-class interceptor</strong> impressively well considering the compact size. You get retractable landing gear that actually works, and gives kids the satisfaction of transforming the ship from flight mode to landed position via a simple mechanism. The cockpit opens smoothly to fit the <strong>Obi-Wan minifigure</strong>, complete with <strong>his blue lightsaber</strong> that stores in dedicated clips on the exterior when he’s flying. Two stud shooters mounted on the wings let you recreate those intense space battles from the Geonosis sequence, and fires with enough force to knock over other LEGO creations without being dangerous.</p>



<p><strong>R4-P17, Obi-Wan’s faithful astromech droid</strong>, gets a special attachment point on the wing where you can place the head of the droid. This detail mirrors how the droid integrates directly into the starfighter in the movies and provides navigation and repair capabilities during missions. The Taun We minifigure marks her first appearance in any LEGO set, which matters to collectors who track these releases. She’s the <strong>Kaminoan</strong> who greets Obi-Wan at the cloning facility and her inclusion adds a narrative element beyond just the starfighter itself.</p>



<p>The finished model <strong>measures 10 inches long, 5 inches wide, and just over 2.5 inches tall</strong>, which makes it substantial enough to display on a shelf without taking up half your bookcase. The proportions work well for swooshing around during play sessions, and construction feels solid enough to survive typical handling from seven-year-olds. LEGO designed this set with a balance between structural integrity and the ability to actually play with it rather than creating a fragile display piece that falls apart if you look at it wrong.</p>
<p>At 282 pieces, you’re looking at<strong> roughly an hour or two of building time</strong> depending on experience level. The instruction booklet breaks everything down into clear steps with color-coded sections so younger builders won’t get frustrated trying to figure out which tiny piece goes where. This piece count hits the sweet spot where it’s engaging enough to feel like an accomplishment but not so overwhelming that kids lose interest halfway through.</p>
<p>The $25 price works out to less than nine cents per piece so this is a pretty comfortable margin below the average LEGO price. Star Wars sets are typically a bit more expensive than average because of the licensing fees, so it’s not common to find one below the usual retail price.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/sony-announces-cheaper-ps5-thats-only-for-japan-2000643085</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/sony-announces-cheaper-ps5-that%E2%80%99s-only-for-japan.1350604/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>During Tuesday’s <a href="https://kotaku.com/playstation-state-of-play-japan-marvel-dragon-quest-2000643049">Japan-focused State of Play</a>, Sony announced a new, cheaper Japanese-language-only PlayStation 5 Digital Edition console that will be available exclusively in Japan. It’s likely a reaction to tariffs in the United States, inflation in Japan, and Nintendo’s own cheaper Japan-only Switch 2.</p>

 <p>On November 11, at the very end of PlayStation’s latest State of Play broadcast, Sony Interactive Entertainment CEO Hideaki Nishino announced “something very special” for gamers in Japan: A Japanese-language-only PS5 console that will cost ¥55,000 yen, which is roughly $350 USD. That same console, <a href="https://kotaku.com/ps5-console-price-increase-sony-america-august-21-2000618873">following a price increase earlier this year</a>, now costs $500 in the United States. Currently, the digital-only PS5 in Japan costs roughly ¥73,000. So if you live in Japan and know the language, you can save quite a bit of money buying this<a href="https://blog.ja.playstation.com/2025/11/12/20251112-ps5/"> cheaper, Japanese-only version of the PS5, which goes on sale on November 21</a>.</p>   <p>As to why Sony is releasing a cheaper, Japan-only PS5, there are a few factors. One of the big ones, <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/f6edb22a-0b19-4073-9e28-ec29b096dde3">as reported by the <em>Financial Times,</em></a> is <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2025/11/07/japanese-real-wages-takaichi-abenomics-inflation-boj-policy.html">rising inflation and the yen losing value</a> in Sony’s home country. And since, as Dr. Serkan Toto, CEO of Tokyo-based game industry consultancy Kantan Games <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/nintendo-will-sell-a-cheaper-330-switch-2-in-japan-thats-region-locked/">told <em>VGC</em></a>, many gamers in Japan don’t care about their consoles being region-locked or restricted to Japanese only, this is a way for Sony to offer a cheaper console to one of its key markets.</p>

 <p>It also makes it harder for resellers and people outside of Japan to snatch up PS5 consoles at a cheaper price, a factor that led to Nintendo offering its very own <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/nintendo-made-a-much-cheaper-japanese-language-only-nintendo-switch-2-and-even-duolingo-is-poking-fun">Japan-only Switch 2 console earlier this year</a>.</p> <p>And yeah, that’s another likely reason for a Japan-only PS5: <a href="https://www.vgchartz.com/article/466071/ps5-outsells-switch-2-ps5-tops-80m-worldwide-hardware-estimates-for-september-2025/#:~:text=by%20over%2051%2C000.-,2025%20year%2Dto%2Ddate%2C%20the%20Nintendo%20Switch%202%20has%20sold%209.24%20million%20units%2C%20the%20PlayStation%205%20has%20sold%20an%20estimated%208.21%20million%20units%2C%20the%20Nintendo%20Switch%201%20has%20sold%203.31%20million%20units%2C%20and%20the%20Xbox%20Series%20X%7CS%20has%20sold%201.69%20million%20units.,-Monthly%20Sales%3A">The Switch 2 is doing very well in the country</a>, and the OG Switch is holding its own, too. Sony’s pricey PS5 is likely too much for consumers in Japan who are struggling with inflation. A cheaper, <a href="https://blog.ja.playstation.com/2025/11/12/20251112-ps5/">region-locked PS5</a> that can’t be easily resold on the grey market could be a big hit in Japan and help Sony regain some ground. It also marks Sony’s first region-locked console since the PlayStation 2.</p> <p>Of course, one more factor in all of this is the ongoing tariffs enacted by President Donald Trump. These tariffs led to Sony raising the price of all PS5 consoles in the United States earlier this year, and a Japan-only PS5 can help the company focus on its local market without having to pay high tariffs or deal with outside buyers. Who had “Region-Locked Consoles Return In 2025” on their horrible bingo card?</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Pixel 9 Now Priced Like Budget Android Phones, Amazon Strikes Hard at Google]]></title>
            <link>https://kotaku.com/pixel-9-now-priced-like-budget-android-phones-amazon-strikes-hard-at-google-2000643048</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/pixel-9-now-priced-like-budget-android-phones-amazon-strikes-hard-at-google.1350553/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Amazon just delivered a serious blow to Google by chopping <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5365/">the Pixel 9 128GB down to an all-time low of $544 on its own platform</a>. This unlocked smartphone is normally $799, but you <strong>can currently get it for 32% off</strong> which places Google’s flagship in the same price bracket as mid-tier Android devices. The irony isn’t lost here: Amazon is making Google’s premium phone more affordable than Google ever has.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5365/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>



<h2>Google’s Flagship Gets the Budget Phone Treatment</h2>
<p>The Pixel 9 is equipped with a <strong>large 6.3-inch Actua display</strong> for sharp visuals-be it when scrolling through social media or watching videos on a commute. This screen size comes as a sweet spot: big enough for comfortable viewing and compact enough to be managed by one hand when you juggle coffee and groceries. Display technology ensures colors pop without the oversaturated look that some phones push just a bit too hard and gives you an accurate representation whether editing photos or simply browsing.</p>
<p>Under the hood, you get 128GB of storage (which works out to about 30,000 photos) or several dozen apps, before you have to start thinking about cloud backup. In many ways, the<strong> 24-hour battery life</strong> lets you leave your charger at home without anxiety for a full workday and into an evening out. Google achieved this by combining power management on its processors with display optimization that adapts to whatever you’re doing, whether that’s reading email or streaming content.</p>



<p>Where the <strong>Pixel 9 really earns its keep is in the camera system</strong>: The heavy lifting is done through Google’s computational photography which means the phone is processing multiple exposures in milliseconds to create shots that look professionally edited straight out of the camera app. Night photography becomes actually useable rather than a grainy mess, thanks to algorithms that brighten shadows while keeping highlights in check.</p>
<p><strong>Integration with Gemini</strong> places Google’s AI assistant right into the core of your workflow: You can ask it to summarize long email threads, draft responses with a specific tone, or pull information from your photos and documents without having to jump between apps. This is not just a repackaged voice assistant; it understands context from your screen and can help with tasks like planning trips by scanning flight confirmations and suggesting activities based on your destination.</p>



<p>What’s great is that <strong>unlocked means you are not tied to any carrier’s payment plan</strong> or restrictions. You can switch providers without dealing with unlock requests or compatibility issues, and international travel is easier, as you can just pop in a local SIM card. This flexibility alone can save you hundreds over a two-year period compared to locked alternatives that charge premium rates for roaming.</p>
<p>Right now, you’re paying just $565 for flagship specs and Google’s best camera tech; that’s less than what many mid-range phones sell for.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Everything We Saw At PlayStation’s Japan-Centric State Of Play]]></title>
            <link>https://kotaku.com/playstation-state-of-play-japan-marvel-dragon-quest-2000643049</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/everything-we-saw-at-playstation%E2%80%99s-japan-centric-state-of-play.1350547/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Today, Sony held a State of Play showcase to talk about upcoming PlayStation 5 games, but this one was a little different. This one was specifically focused on Japan-developed games, as well as projects from other Asian studios. The State of Play Japan showcase was hosted by <em>Ys&nbsp;</em>actor Yuki Kaji, and was only streamed in Japanese, even in other territories. It did have English subtitles, though, so if you want to watch the 40-minute presentation, you can do so below. If you just want the highlights, though, we’ve got you covered.</p>

  <h2><em>Dragon Quest VII Reimagining</em></h2>  <p>Kicking off the show was&nbsp;<em>Dragon Quest VII Remastered</em>. I don’t know why I was surprised that the trailer was in English. I guess I just assumed the “Japanese audio with English subtitles” extended to the trailers as well. But anyway, we saw a pretty story-heavy trailer of this from-the-ground-up reimagining of <em>Dragon Quest VII</em>. The game is coming out on February 5.</p>

 <h2><em>inKONBINI: One Store, Many Stories</em></h2>  <p>Next up is a management sim&nbsp;called&nbsp;<em>inKONBINI: One Store, Many Stories</em>, in which the player runs a corner store. You’ll manage your merchandise, chat with customers, and collect stuff from the vending machines in April 2026.</p>

 <h2><em>Coffee Talk Tokyo</em></h2> <p>The next entry in the coffee shop social simulator series&nbsp;<em>Coffee Talk&nbsp;</em>is&nbsp;<em>Coffee Talk Tokyo</em>, which is exactly what it sounds like. You’ll make coffee for patrons in a cyberpunk Tokyo on March 5.</p> <h2><em>BrokenLore</em></h2>  <p>Two new games in the&nbsp;<em>BrokenLore </em>horror series are coming. The first is <em>Unfollow</em>, which is all about the dark side of social media. It’s coming on January 16. The next entry will be called <em>BrokenLore: Ascend</em>, and will have a focus on vertical climbing movement. It will launch next summer.</p>

  <h2><em>Fatal Frame II: Crimson Butterfly</em></h2>  <p>Sony decided to get a bunch of spooky stuff out of the way at once, as next up is a remake of <em>Fatal Frame II: Crimson Butterfly </em>helmed by <em>Dead or Alive </em>and <em>Ninja Gaiden </em>developer Team Ninja.&nbsp;Yeah, that shit looks as creepy as it did on the PS2. The remake will launch on March 12.</p>

 <h2><em>Dynasty Warriors: Origins</em></h2>  <p>Koei Tecmo also showed off a new DLC for&nbsp;<em>Dynasty Warriors: Origins </em>called <em>Visions of Four Heroes</em>. It launches on January 22.</p> <h2><em>Gran Turismo 7</em></h2>  <p>Oh hey, at least one of the teams under PlayStation Studios is here for the show. Polyphony Digital showed up with the <em>Gran Turismo 7 Power Pack</em>, which will add new racing modes to the game later this year.</p>

 <h2>Rapid-fire announcements</h2>  <p>Next up we saw a few smaller games like <em>MotionRec</em>, a sci-fi puzzle platformer,&nbsp;<em>Wandering Sword</em>, an HD-2D RPG set in ancient China, the PS4 and PS5 release of <em>No Sleep For Kadame Date –&nbsp;AI The Somnium Files</em>, and <em>Tokyo Xtreme Racer.&nbsp;</em></p>

 <h2>Bandai Namco’s DLC minute</h2>  <p>Bandai Namco had a few DLCs to announce for some of its games. First up was&nbsp;<em>Once Upon a Katamari</em>, which is getting two DLC packs with new levels, cosmetics, and music. <em>Pac-Man World 2: Re-Pac&nbsp;</em>is getting&nbsp;<em>Sonic the Hedgehog&nbsp;</em>levels, which are available today.&nbsp;<em>Digimon Story: Time Stranger</em>‘s first DLC includes a new story chapter that adds five new Digimon to the roster, and is coming this winter. <em>Super Robot Wars Y</em> is getting its first collab DLC, which adds characters from&nbsp;<em>Kamen Rider</em>.</p> <h2><em>Monster Hunter Wilds</em></h2> <p><em>Monster Hunter Wilds&nbsp;</em>is also getting some DLC. The Free Title Update 4 will launch on December 16, and adds more monsters to hunt and additions to the RPG’s endgame.</p> <h2><em>Sonic Racing: Crossworlds</em></h2> <p>Because the crossover slop never ends,&nbsp;<em>Sonic Racing: Crossworlds&nbsp;</em>is getting more crossover characters as DLC from&nbsp;<em>Nights</em> and <em>Super Monkey Ball</em>. It’ll also get Tangle and Whisper, some lesser-known <em>Sonic&nbsp;</em>characters. Oh yeah, and the Spongebob pack is coming on November 19. Blah.</p>

 <h2><em>Never Grave: The Witch and the Curse</em></h2>  <p>Next up is&nbsp;<em>Never Grave: The Witch and the Curse</em>, an action platformer that looks like the kind of thing you’d play if&nbsp;<em>Hollow Knight: Silksong&nbsp;</em>just wasn’t enough torment for you. The game will launch on March 5.</p> <h2><em>Blazblue: Entropy Effect X</em></h2>  <p>I see Arc System Works’ logo and I perk up. The studio is making a new entry in the <em>Blazblue: Entropy Effect </em>subseries with <em>Entropy Effect X</em>. The action platformer has the team’s incredible visual flare and looks super challenging. It will launch on February 12.</p>

 <h2>More rapid fire game updates</h2>  <p>Nextt we got another series of bite-sized looks at some smaller games. First up is twin-stick shooter/platformer <em>Damon and Baby</em>, followed by a new Prinny-infested action RPG from the <em>Disgaea </em>team called <em>Kyouran Makaism</em>.&nbsp;<em>Fate Trigger</em>, a fast-paced hero shooter featuring ten distinct playable characters, wrapped up the segment.</p> <h2><em>Octopath Traveler 0</em></h2>  <p>Damn. The host mentioned a beloved Square Enix series and my&nbsp;<em>Kingdom Hearts&nbsp;</em>copium started up. But no, instead we got a new look at <em>Octopath Traveler 0</em>. It sure looks like one of those! Square Enix has released a demo that will allow you to carry over your saved data to the main game when it launches on December 4.</p> <h2><em>Marvel Tokon: Fighting Souls</em></h2>  <p>Now that’s the Arc System Works game I wanted to see. The studio’s upcoming&nbsp;<em>Marvel&nbsp;</em>game is putting an anime fighter spin on the comic book icons.&nbsp;<em>Marvel Tokon: Fighting Souls&nbsp;</em>is getting a new beta test that will include new stages and add Spider-Man and Ghost Rider as playable characters. The test will take place from December 5 to 7.</p>

 <h2><em>Elden Ring Nightreign</em></h2>  <p>Bandai Namco wasn’t done with DLC, actually.&nbsp;<em>Elden Ring Nightreign&nbsp;</em>got its own special little segment for its&nbsp;<em>The Forsaken Hollows&nbsp;</em>expansion. If you and your friends are ready to head back into The Lands Between, you can do so December 4.</p> <p>Oh, that was the end? Alrighty then. RIP to the&nbsp;<em>Kingdom Hearts&nbsp;</em>fans who were holding their breath. We’ll do this whole song and dance again at The Game Awards.</p>
