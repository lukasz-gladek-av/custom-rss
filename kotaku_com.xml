              <p>Over the last few years, it feels like there has been a large increase in the <a href="https://kotaku.com/reeses-peanut-butter-cups-now-with-hard-bits-1776649563">number of limited-time Reese’s Cup variations</a> and gimmicks. Many of these have been bad. But the newest crossover featuring Oreo cookies is the first time I’ve tried one of these oddball concoctions and enjoyed it. But only when RNG was on my side.</p> <p><a href="https://www.facebook.com/reeses/posts/you-asked-we-crushed-it-reeses-oreo-cups-are-coming-this-september/1218885443616524/">Released this month, the new Reese’s Oreo cup</a> isn’t simply a <a href="https://kotaku.com/halloween-candy-ranking-worst-best-list-chocolate-bar-1851679251/38">Reese’s cup</a> with some Oreo bits shoved inside. Well, okay, sure, it is mostly that, but the Reese’s cup itself is half milk chocolate and half white chocolate. As someone who is a big fan of the white chocolate Reese’s Cup, I was very happy about this choice. It also makes sense as the Oreo cookie bits, in theory at least, should blend with the white chocolate to create something similar in taste to an actual Oreo cookie.</p> <p>And then you have the classic Reese’s peanut butter filling, which is fine by me as I love that stuff more than real peanut butter. So does this all come together into a winning creation? Well, you know the answer already, I said it in the first paragraph. But yes, it’s pretty dang good!</p>

 <p>The cookie bits add a nice and crunchy texture to each cup, and the darker, more bitter flavor of the Oreo cookie cuts through the peanut butter, so they complement each other in a way that a lot of other gimmicky flavors have been lacking. But that Oreo-ness also doesn’t overpower the entire cup, something that can also happen. (Looking at you, fudge-filled Reese’s Cups.) Instead, the cookie bits and the rest of the cup blend together perfectly. The white chocolate top of the cup also helps add a bit of sweetness and creaminess to the candy, which does sort of recreate the taste of an Oreo that has been dipped in peanut butter. I would know how that tastes, as I’ve done that many times before.</p> <figure id="attachment_2000623478" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000623478"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000623478">©Reese’s / Oreo</figcaption></figure> <p>There is an asterisk, though, next to my “Pretty Dang Good!” appraisal of the new Oreo Reese’s abomination. It all depends on how much Oreo is in your Reese’s Cups. I bought four of the King Size version and three of them had a lot of cookie bits and were fantastic. But one had barely any inside the peanut butter, so you were left with a cup that was just half white chocolate and half milk chocolate. Not a horrible fate, but disappointing if you were expecting some Oreo goodness.</p>

 <p>For those of you out there who miss the <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=crunchy+cookie+cup&amp;rlz=1C1ONGR_enUS955US955&amp;sourceid=chrome&amp;ie=UTF-8#imgrc=D8sfDROw0w3ReM&amp;imgdii=EKOEBjAnc7XWNM">Crunchy Cookie Reese’s Cup from the ’90s</a>, this might be your best bet for re-experiencing that fan-favorite flavor that is no longer sold by Reese’s. From my memory, it’s not quite the same thing, but it’s awfully close. And in the absence of Reese’s bringing it back, this will do just fine for all of you longing for the sweet return of the Crunchy Cookie cup.</p> <p>One last note: If you do buy some of these, stick ’em in the fridge. The one I stuck in the fridge and tasted a few hours later was even better. I mean, Reese’s Cups in general are better cold, but these in particular taste wonderful. The cold stiffens up the chocolate more and adds even more crunch. It’s nice. I can’t buy any more or I’ll eat them all.</p>
