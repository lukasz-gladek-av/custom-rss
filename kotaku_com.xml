              <p>Didn’t get a chance to grab a solid tablet during Black Friday? Don’t worry. Cyber Monday is here, slashing prices across all popular categories, and offering one last chance to save massively before the holiday season begins.</p>
<p>We’ve been spotting tons of great options going for less, and if you’re after something that covers all the basics while staying under the $100 mark, <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6135/">the Lenovo Tab One is an excellent option to consider. It’s now sitting at just $90, after a nice 25% discount, and there are no delivery charges to worry about either.</a> It’s not every day you get to grab an impressive screen while also saving on shipping, so get your orders in sooner rather than later. The tablet is going to be pushed back to its retail price of $120 at midnight, which is why it’s best to act fast.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6135/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Bright Visuals, Even Better Sound</h2>
<p>We won’t label it as a massive tablet. You’re getting a modest 8.7-inch display, which isn’t overwhelmingly large; just enough for a comfortable viewing experience on the go. The display pushes vibrant visuals, while the 480 nits of brightness ensure exceptional visibility in all lighting conditions. Of course, visuals alone aren’t enough for an immersive streaming experience, which is why Lenovo packs the tablet with dual Dolby Atmos speakers for bold, rich audio. Translation? Brighter content, paired with an even better sound that brings your favorite content to life.</p>
<p>Performance is taken care of by the MediaTek Helio G85 processor, plus a 60Hz refresh rate, both of which come together to ensure a smooth, lag-free experience. You won’t exactly be able to multitask on this tablet, but it holds up well for casual use like browsing, streaming, video calls, etc. In fact, it’s a great option for kids, too. Google Kids Space support lets you introduce your little ones to teacher-approved content based on their interests. Subscribe to YouTube Kids, and you’ll have instant access to thousands of age-appropriate videos and hundreds of books, all ad-free.</p>



<p>Storing all the media content and programs you want won’t be an issue, thanks to the massive 64GB of storage, which is quite rare to find in this price range. If you’re purchasing it for your kids, you can pre-install a bunch of kid-friendly apps and games to keep them entertained for hours. There’s an included folio case to protect your tablet from the inevitable daily wear and tear. The built-in stand lets you prop it up wherever you like, however you prefer it. Place it on your workstation, a cafe, or even your bed for some late-night streaming sessions. As for the battery, a single charge gets you around 12.5 hours of unplugged YouTube streaming. It’s also designed to recharge faster than previous models, so it should be back at it in no time when running low. And since the tablet is compact, you don’t have to get a dedicated bag to carry it. Just toss it in your purse or backpack, and you’re good to go.</p>
<p>To wrap it up, this tablet isn’t a powerhouse. It’s made to do all the basic tasks, and it does those well. We especially recommend it for kids/teenagers wanting to have their own device. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6135/">The current deal brings it down to just $90, which is pretty cheap for a tablet from a known brand.</a> It’s also one of the lowest we have seen it drop to in a long while, but the offer ends soon. Grab yours before it’s too late.</p>

              <p>Whether you’ve accepted the PvP nature of PvPvE extraction shooter <i>Arc Raiders</i> or not, getting betrayed still sucks. Getting stabbed in the back always feels unnecessarily mean <i>and</i> there’s no direct way to get some revenge, as the odds of you running into and recognizing the same person in a future game are pretty low.</p> <p>But a new community resource hopes to change that.</p> <p>Enter <a href="https://speranzabounties.com/">Speranza Bounties</a>, a fan-made site that does just what you think it does: publicly tracks troublesome rats up to no good out there in the Rust Belt (<a href="https://www.polygon.com/arc-raiders-bounty-hunting-fansite/">h/t <i>Polygon</i></a>). Not only can you check to see what active bounties are on deserving players, which includes information such as what bad deeds they committed (extraction camping, lying, bait and switches, etc), but you can also post your own. All you need is a player’s Embark ID, which you can find by looking at who killed you in the post-game carnage report.</p>

 <p>Speranza Bounties keeps track of all bounties for 30 days, after which they expire. So if you find yourself on this naughty list, just lay low for about a month. The site also awards you with titles for taking down a player with an active bounty.</p>

 <h2>PvP could use a little extra love in <i>Arc Raiders</i></h2> <p>I’ll gladly get sent back to Speranza on this hill: PvP belongs in <i>Arc Raiders</i>. We don’t need exclusive PvP modes or maps or a PvE mode.</p> <p>That said, every time I get downed by another player, damn do I wish there was someway to exact revenge. While it’s a neat social experiment to wrestle with that impulse, I think tools like Speranza Bounties (as well as the fictional Speranza Watchlist) show that some added social elements to PvP, such as a bounty system or user-facing behavior report system that isn’t strictly punitive could add more ways to interact with the PvP element of this otherwise fantastic game.</p> <p>And no. I do not have a bounty on my head.</p> <p>…yet.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/ioi-promises-that-of-course-it-is-going-to-make-a-new-hitman-game-2000649142</link>
            <guid>1369429</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Good morning! I hope you enjoyed a lot of turkey. I did. I celebrated two Thanksgivings. Double the fun, double the calories. Anyway, welcome back from holiday break, and let’s get right into Morning Checkpoint, <em>Kotaku’s</em> daily round-up of gaming news and other stuff you might care about. And please, nobody mention turkey. I’m done with it until next year.</p> <h2>There Will Be Another <em>Hitman</em> Game, Says IOI</h2> <p>IO Interactive is currently wrapping up <em>007: First Light,</em> which is set to launch in March of next year. While some are excited, there are plenty of <em>Hitman</em> fans who are worried that perhaps Agent 47 and his deadly franchise have entered extended retirement. That’s not the case.</p>

 <p>“So of course there will be more <em>Hitman</em>,” <a href="https://variety.com/2025/gaming/news/hitman-eminem-slim-shady-mission-io-interactive-ceo-interview-1236595901/">IO Interactive CEO Hakan Abrak told <em>Variety</em>.</a> “But right now, I think we need to get to the other side of this year and next year you’ll get more news about <em>Hitman</em> co-op, because I think co-op is a really, really good extension to the universe, and will introduce very interesting mechanics and combinations in <em>World of Assassination.</em> But we will, after that, be talking about the next <em>Hitman</em> — because, of course, there’s going to be a next <em>Hitman</em>.”</p>

 <h2><em>Zootopia 2</em> had one of the best opening weekends ever</h2> <p><em>Zootopia 2</em> hit theaters over the holiday weekend, and it broke a whole bunch of records on its way to earning an impressive $556 million. <a href="https://deadline.com/2025/11/zootopia-2-box-office-records-1236631348/">As reported by <em>Deadline</em></a>, Disney’s new animated sequel had the largest opening for an animated movie in history, was the fourth-biggest opening in movie history ever, and now also holds the record as Disney’s biggest animated movie opening. And that’s just <em>some</em> of the records it smashed.</p>

 <h2>A bunch of Xbox games are nominated for PlayStation Game of the Year awards</h2> <p>On Monday, <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/12/01/ps-blog-game-of-the-year-awards-2025-polls-are-now-live/">Sony announced</a> that fan voting for this 2025’s PlayStation Blog Game of the Year Awards was now open. And if you peruse the categories, you’ll notice that an awful lot of games are from studios or publishers owned by Xbox, including <em>Call of Duty: Black Ops 7, The Outer Worlds 2,</em> and <em>Forza Horizon.</em> In fact, four of the games nominated for the blog’s top honors, Best PS5 game of 2025, are from Xbox-owned studios. Video games in 2025 are so weird now, y’all.</p>

 <h2>Oops, some <em>GTA 6</em> animations have leaked</h2> <p>A demo reel containing what appears to be <a href="https://x.com/GTAVI_Countdown/status/1995234091856478416"><em>GTA 6</em> animations</a> was uploaded by an animator who worked on the highly anticipated open-world game. Fans quickly spotted the animations and started sharing them online. Of course, the video has since been deleted, but that hasn’t stopped the animations from spreading on social media and Reddit.</p> <p>The clips show a man loading an electric bike into a bike rack and a woman jumping out of a pickup truck. Not the most exciting stuff, but fans who have been waiting for over a decade for<em> GTA 6</em> will take anything they can get their hands on between now and the game’s launch on November 19, 2026.</p> <h2>ICYMI:</h2> <ul> <li><a href="https://kotaku.com/the-perfect-thanksgiving-plate-2000648127">What’s the perfect Thanksgiving plate?&nbsp;</a></li> <li><a href="https://kotaku.com/indie-games-pc-steam-wishlist-black-friday-thanksgaming-2000648371">Here are some good indie games!</a></li> <li><a href="https://kotaku.com/2025-best-games-monster-hunter-split-fiction-avowed-1851767689">The best of 2025 (so far…)</a></li> </ul> <h2>Watch this:</h2>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/seagate-goes-beyond-ssds-dropping-2tb-external-hard-drive-to-0-03-per-gb-for-playstation-xbox-pc-and-mac-2000648968</link>
            <guid>1369360</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Storage issues are more common than you think, and they affect almost everyone now and then; from work professionals to creatives, students, gamers, and even casual users. If you’ve been looking to expand the capacity of your PC, Mac, or console, we just spotted a deal that lets you do it for less.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6133/">Thanks to Cyber Monday, Amazon is offering the Seagate 2TB portable external hard drive at a 19% discount.</a> It usually sits at an already-affordable retail price of $80, but this $15 discount is making the upgrade even more approachable. It’s available to all shoppers, whether you have a Prime membership or prefer shopping without it. The only catch? The offer is selling out fast, and it expires tonight. You only have a few more hours left to save, so it’s better to grab yours without wasting more time. Once it’s gone, we don’t expect it to be back at this price anytime soon.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6133/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Offload Files, House All Your Important Data</h2>
<p>Starting off with the capacity; you’re getting a nice 2TB of additional storage for your device. That’s enough to offload a bunch of files you don’t use as frequently to free some space on your internal storage, plus house all your important data. Think thousands of photos, hundreds of videos, heavy presentations, creative projects, long research papers, and never-ending spreadsheets. You’ll even be able to throw in some gaming titles. The 2TB capacity is enough for most users who don’t just want to rely on their internal storage for day-to-day use, but if it feels limited, Seagate is offering plenty of other options at a discount, too.</p>
<p>This HDD plays nicely with Windows or Mac computers, and the drag-and-drop functionality lets you transfer files across both with ease. It’s a traditional hard drive, so the speeds won’t be as fast as an SSD, but still not too bad for casual use. Getting started couldn’t be simpler. It’s preformatted for Windows and Mac, so all that you need to do is connect the drive to your device using the 18-inch USB 3.0 cable. Your device will recognize the HDD automatically, without requiring any specific software installation. It shouldn’t take more than a few minutes for it to get up and running!</p>



<p>It’s also quite portable, which makes it easy to carry your entire digital library of documents and games with you, wherever you go. Just plug it into any computer, and access all the important stuff in seconds. This is great for anyone working remotely, and even for those relying on two devices at the same time. You won’t need to transfer files to both your PC and your laptop; the drive does it all.</p>
<p>In short, if you’ve been wanting to invest in a storage solution that’s both reliable and easy to carry around, this deal lets you do that for less. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6133/">On a regular day, you’d pay around $80 to enjoy the same features, but Amazon’s Cyber Monday sale lets you pick the solution up for just $65.</a> If 2TB is more than what you need, there’s a 1TB option available, too. Creatives looking for more space can consider the 4TB or 5TB versions, or go all out with the massive 8TB or 12TB options. There’s plenty to choose from, but we highly recommend grabbing yours fast. The deal ends soon, and you don’t want to be disappointed at the very last minute. It’s also a good idea to stock up on anything else you missed grabbing during Black Friday, whether it’s tech gadgets or entertainment upgrades.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[There’s A Scene In Zootopia 2 That Convinced Me Disney Read The Abortion Comic]]></title>
            <link>https://kotaku.com/zootopia-2-nick-judy-relationship-romance-abortion-comic-2000649147</link>
            <guid>1369357</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><span>Being </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/disney-movies-best-worst-ranking-frozen-moana-tangled-1851708848"><span>a </span><i><span>Zootopia </span></i><span>fan</span></a><span> on the internet is like being god’s strongest soldier fighting the uncaring deity’s toughest battles. You can’t talk about how much you like </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/disney-plus-ai-generated-user-videos-ugc-sora-mickey-2000644077"><span>Disney’s</span></a><span> politically-charged take on the animal kingdom without it somehow veering into the topic of furry porn or a buckwild fan comic about aborting a fox/rabbit hybrid.</span></p> <p><span>Despite </span><i><span>Zootopia </span></i><span>not really getting into cross-species romance, something that has followed the franchise since the 2016 original is that a large, very loud side of the internet ships ex-con fox Nick Wilde and his bunny cop bestie Judy Hopps, and there’s no shortage of art, fanfiction, and fan theories about the two pining for one another. Infamously,, someone wrote a viral fan comic starring the two in which their relationship unravels over Judy wanting to abort their fox/rabbit hybrid baby that has become such a prominent meme in pop culture that it </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/I_Will_Survive_(comic)"><span>has its own Wikipedia page</span></a><span> After seeing </span><i><span>Zootopia 2 </span></i><span>twice, I’m pretty confident someone at Disney has read that comic or is at least aware of it, and all the other nasty things y’all have been saying about these two for nearly a decade. Disney may not be looking directly into the abyss, as a lot of big studios </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Legal_issues_with_fan_fiction"><span>won’t read fan works</span></a><span> for fear of potential legal trouble if their stories end up overlapping with something an admirer wrote or drew, but </span><i><span>Zootopia 2 </span></i><span>has all the makings of a movie almost winking at its fans in an hour-and-a-half-long metatexual tease. Despite this, the studio refuses to give WildeHopps shippers the catharsis they so desperately crave.</span></p>

  <p><i><span>Zootopia 2 </span></i><span>is straightbaiting, or using a potential romantic pairing like a carrot on a stick to draw in an audience they won’t actually satisfy. After living decades watching pairings of men with a ton of chemistry not end up confessing their love for one another in a sloppy on-screen kiss, I think that’s beautiful. Don’t come for me, saying that “straightbaiting” isn’t a real thing because straight ships aren’t victims to the same societal stigmas as queer ones. This is too funny for me. Let me have this. The movie begins with what feels like a direct homage to the abortion comic by having the pair do some undercover cop work, masquerading as a couple with a baby (Nick’s ex-crime partner Finnick, also in disguise). Their perp acknowledges the interspecies pairing is a bit different, but not unheard of in the city of Zootopia, where predator and prey live together in harmony. But when one of the most viral fan creations is about these two as would-be parents, leading your long-awaited sequel with a scene of these cops cosplaying as mom and dad to a little fox baby feels very intentional, and </span><i><span>Zootopia 2 </span></i><span>doesn’t let up with one gag.</span></p>

 <p><span>If you ignore what Nick and Judy actually say to each other, </span><i><span>Zootopia 2 </span></i><span>has all the makings of a slow-burning enemies-to-friends-to-lovers arc a decade in the making. They’re constantly referring to each other as “partners,” as they’re the Zootopia Police Department’s newest duo, and they’re celebrating their week-long anniversary while trying to sort through their differences. They go to partner counseling, when Judy makes a joke about their anniversary while they ride on a Walrus’ belly, their chauffeur puts on mood lighting and plays one of Disney’s most iconic love songs, “Bella Notte” from </span><i><span>Lady and the Tramp</span></i><span>, and there’s a scene where mountain goats send the pair up to a honeymoon suite likely assuming they’re heading up to make a hybrid baby.</span></p>

 <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr"><a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/z2spoilers?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#z2spoilers</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/zootopia2spoilers?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#zootopia2spoilers</a> <br>i don't see anyone freaking out over this yet so allow me bc this is one of my many new roman empires: </p> <p>WDYM THEY PLAYED BELLA NOTTE FROM LADY AND THE TRAMP ONE OF THE MOST ROMANTIC MOVIE SCENES EVER??? <a href="https://t.co/P3CKTNh6iD">pic.twitter.com/P3CKTNh6iD</a></p> <p>— caro 🐾 #z2spoilers❗ (@pumpkinberryxo) <a href="https://twitter.com/pumpkinberryxo/status/1994198957312835724?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 28, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <p><span>The brilliant part of this is that these assumptions play out without Nick and Judy ever acknowledging them. It would be so easy for the two to get really animated about these moments and be like, “No way! He’s just my partner. We’re just friends who have never even considered each other like that.” Instead, Nick and Judy let these moments go and focus on what’s actually important. Even in the height of the two’s crisis point, Nick refers to Judy explicitly as a friend, and when all of these conflicts come to a head in a glorious overshare of therapy speak, the two never even say a word about any romantic feelings. They talk to each other the way two secure, platonic individuals do: with an open, honest apology for their respective flaws, and a hope that they can work together better in the inevitable next movie.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><span>That’s not to say that </span><i><span>Zootopia 2 </span></i><span>doesn’t have moments that could absolutely be read as romantic tension. Early on in the film, when the pair is scoping out a gala, Nick sees Judy yapping it up with Pawbert Lynxley, the awkward rich kid who seems to be an outcast in his evil rich people family. He gets so distracted by what looks like a fit of jealousy that he runs into a fellow party patron. It was in that moment that I worried that </span><i><span>Zootopia 2 </span></i><span>might actually go down the romantic road, but even when Nick is having a major confessional moment, much later, after Judy runs off with Pawbert to try and salvage their larger case, he doesn’t confess any romantic feelings.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>Fans will inevitably read </span><i><span>Zootopia 2 </span></i><span>as another chapter in a decade-long slow burn, but as someone who finds Nick and Judy’s security in their friendship to be one of these movies’ greatest strengths, I gotta give Disney props for keeping their love platonic. That’s after a decade of earnest shipping and also a </span><i><span>whole fucking lot </span></i><span>of fan works. There are </span><a href="https://archiveofourown.org/tags/Judy%20Hopps*s*Nick%20Wilde/works"><span>literally thousands of fanfiction entries</span></a><span> of the two’s hypothetical relationship, and the Nick and Judy tags on </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/rule-34-rule34dle-guessing-game-stream-site-where-play-2000642575"><span>Rule 34</span></a><span> both have five-figure post counts of illustrated smut. But in </span><i><span>Zootopia 2</span></i><span>, Nick says, “Love you, partner,” at the end of the movie, and he means that platonically. Jury’s still out on how he feels about abortions, though. But hey, he has some very weird hangups about reptiles that are giving “conservative cousin at Thanksgiving,” so maybe he’s anti-choice, and we’ll find out when </span><i><span>Zootopia 3 </span></i><span>comes out sometime in the 2030s.</span></p>
