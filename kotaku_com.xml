" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>The Mix Summer Showcase ran over 90 minutes and offered quick looks at dozens of upcoming games. Formerly known as Guerrilla Collective, the showcase is one of many indie events swirling around the orbit of Summer Game Fest, and unlike many of the bigger games getting shown off in the days ahead, some of these have playable demos right now while others are likely getting them in the weeks and months ahead. </p><p>We picked out nine that caught our eye. Some of them were being shown for the first time. Others were previously revealed but had gone under our radar since, or popped up with fresh trailers showing a deeper look at story, world-building, and gameplay. But there were a ton more games worth checking out and wishlisting in the full showcase. You can see all of them for yourself in the video below. </p></div></div><div><p>The most intriguing reveal was a tactical RPG from a small studio called Hypersect led by a former <em>Destiny</em> sandbox gameplay engineer, an <em>Octopath Traveler </em>monster artist, and the composer of <em>Enter the Gungeon</em>. <em>Never’s End</em>’s pitch? <em>Final Fantasy Tactics</em> collides with city management as you raise an army of possessed warriors to protect the last human settlement from a magical apocalypse. There’s no release date yet but it’s coming to PC and PlayStation. </p></div><div><p> <em>Airframe Ultra</em> looks like <em>Wipeout</em> meets <em>Twisted Metal</em>. It’s got a slick PS1 presentation and a gritty vibe that would fit right at home on a long-lost demo disc. It’s the newest project from<em> Rain World </em>maker Videocult so it will probably be uncompromising in every way. </p></div><div><p>Rig dice to beat evil billionaires at their own deranged games. That’s the basic premise of <em>Dead Finger Dice</em>, a point-and-click roguelike about gambling with ghouls and trying to escape the yacht they’ve imprisoned you on. It’s giving <em>Inscryption</em> meets<em> Cryptmaster</em> if they were made in MS-DOS. A survival horror spin on <em>Balatro</em>? Let’s go. </p></div><div><p>The gardenvania subgrene expands with Beauty Cult’s <em>Nectarmancer</em>, a gorgeous-looking action platformer that doubles as a farming sim. Grow crops and fight in tight 2D spaces as you try to take down The Throne, a mysterious cabal exploiting the world’s resources for its own gain. Here’s the line from the Steam page that sold me: “Use a network of plants and their latent nectarmancy to build up a planet-scale biological research computer to acquire even more nectar.” Yes. Yes I will. </p></div><div><p>At first glance I thought <em>Critterrupters</em> was an<em> Animal Crossing</em> clone but it’s actually more like<em> Pokémon</em>. Go from 3D exploration to 2D turn-based augmented reality battles with a focus on interrupting your opponent’s attack to gain an advantage. There’s over 100  Critter Chips to collect, train, and “puzzle out” with the goal of defeating gym leaders and meeting the creator of the virtual Tamagotchi-based warriors. </p></div><div><p>Motorslice is an atmospheric parkour adventure in which you wall-run and slash your way through a futuristic construction site with the vibe of <em>Shadow of the Colossus</em> inside a mega city. Think indie, PS2-era <em>Mirror’s Edge</em> with a sword and heavy machinery boss fights. There’s a bit of a Tarkovskian undertone. <em>Prince of Persia</em> is also an influence according to the developers. Should I just keep name-dropping cool stuff?</p></div><div><p>A boomer shooter segment near the end of the showcase included a bunch of experimental first-person shooters, but <em>Moros Protocol</em> has been in production for five years and is the one that stuck out to me. The sci-fi roguelike combines <em>Doom </em>and <em>Dark Souls</em> for a low-poly fever dream that supports co-op. “And yes, you can kick your enemies,” the devs write. </p></div><div><p><em>Nocturne </em>is a story-focused JRPG that uses rhythm gameplay for its combat. <em>Rock Paper Shotgun</em> <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/chrono-trigger-meets-guitar-hero-was-not-on-my-bingo-card-but-ill-take-it-regardless&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/chrono-trigger-meets-guitar-hero-was-not-on-my-bingo-card-but-ill-take-it-regardless" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">likened it to</a></span> “<em>Chrono Trigger</em> meets <em>Guitar Hero</em>.” It might not end up an all-time classic like those, but the pixel art and soundtrack are pretty neat. What’s it about? “Your consciousness was uploaded to a world where a sentient AI has taken control, twisted creatures roam the land, and a vast corruption spreads.” An increasingly relatable predicament!</p></div><div><p><em>Monsters are Coming! Rock &amp; Road </em>mixes and matches elements from lots of popular genres, including city builders and arcade-y bullet hell grindfests. The neat thing here is that the city you grow travels around and turns into a weapon itself, unleashing hell in <em>Vampire Survivors</em>-style horde mode onslaughts. There’s a closed beta happening later this summer. <br></p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://kotaku.com/monster-hunter-wilds-diva-buffs-performance-grand-hub-1851783501<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>From minor bug fixes to <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/monster-hunter-wilds-mh-defeat-mizutsune-bubbles-temper-1851781466&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/monster-hunter-wilds-mh-defeat-mizutsune-bubbles-temper-1851781466">new monsters</a></span>, <em>Monster Hunter Wilds’</em> first Title Update added a lot. The multiplayer Grand Hub area has also been a welcome addition from the community, especially when it includes a performing singer who provides some fun bonuses. Here’s what you need to know about the Diva and what stat boosts she can provide.</p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="197580" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="GameStop Doubles Down On Crypto With Massive Bitcoin Purchase As Stores Close" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="88" data-playlist="197580,197576,197567" data-current="197580"><div><p>GameStop Doubles Down On Crypto With Massive Bitcoin Purchase As Stores Close</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197580/197580_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197580/197580_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197580/197580_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/23101.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><h2 id="h1950393"><a id="1"></a>When does the Diva Sing?</h2><p>When visiting the Grand Hub, there is a chance you might catch a couple of songs at night. <strong>The Diva will randomly appear for two performances when the night cycle begins and ends</strong>. She appears on the large platform at the back end of the area. There is no way to manually <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/monster-hunter-wilds-rest-plenty-fallow-inclemency-1851776094&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/monster-hunter-wilds-rest-plenty-fallow-inclemency-1851776094">change time</a></span> in the Grand Hub itself, so it all comes down to luck if you see her. Time in the Grand Hub runs separately from other locations, so assuming you don’t want to wait around 50 minutes for night to come again, I suggest tackling some hunts and returning in between to see if she’s there.</p><p>The good news is that the Diva always performs twice. After her first performance at sunset, she’ll remain in a praying position until it’s time for the second performance at sunrise. You’ll know it’s time for a performance if the BGM stops and multiple NPCs start moving towards the viewing area. A lot of players like to watch as well, so joining them when they gather is a good way to tell.</p><p>During the <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/monster-hunter-wilds-blossomdance-event-tickets-1851778319&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/monster-hunter-wilds-blossomdance-event-tickets-1851778319">Festival of Accord: Blossomdance event</a></span>, the Diva would put on another performance in the middle of the night cycle. Switching between seasonal songs and the typical one she performs made it feel like a fun, more organic mini-concert than just a reucurring NPC bit! Hopefully this will be the norm for future events as well.</p><h2 id="h1950394"><a id="2"></a>What are the Diva Buffs?</h2><figure id="" data-id="9729150cea0bd9f375af15462c61134d" data-recommend-id="image://9729150cea0bd9f375af15462c61134d" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A hunter sits at a table after having their stats boosted by the Diva’s performance." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A hunter sits at a table after having their stats boosted by the Diva’s performance." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Capcom / Samuel Moreno / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="9729150cea0bd9f375af15462c61134d" data-recommend-id="image://9729150cea0bd9f375af15462c61134d" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A hunter sits at a table after having their stats boosted by the Diva’s performance." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p><strong>Being relatively close to the Diva when one of her performances ends will grant you a buff</strong>. That means you can earn two from her during most nights, or potentially three during an event. Unfortunately, the game doesn’t provide specifics besides a general message saying “Stats boosted thanks to the Diva’s voice of prayer and gratitude” once the song is over. <strong>What the Diva’s performance actually does is provide you with one out of five random buffs.</strong> Here is a list of what you can receive and the items that provide the same effects:</p><ul data-type="List" data-style="Bullet"><li>+7 Attack (Mega Demondrug)</li><li>+15 Defense (Armorskin)</li><li>50+ Maximum Health (Well-done Steak)</li><li>+25 Maximum Stamina (Well-done Steak)</li><li>Increased HP Regen (Wild Jerky)</li></ul><p>Unless you know exactly what your stats were before or don’t have any current buffs from items or meals,<strong> the only way to generally tell what was boosted is if you see a new icon above your health bar</strong>. Any new buffs will be added on the right side. If you’re like me and don’t know all these little icons by heart, you can see what each means by heading to the Play Guide and selecting the Basic Controls tab. The first page of this sub-menu lists multiple status effects and which icons represent them.</p><p>The Diva’s buffs can stack with other buffs, but their limits are the same as their item equivalent. That means that while a Mega Demondrug won’t provide a stat boost with the Diva’s attack buff, a Mega Armorskin will completely override her defense buff.</p><p>Listening to a Diva performance won’t provide any game-breaking boosts for the <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/monster-hunter-wilds-mh-zoh-shia-crystals-farm-1851781913&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/monster-hunter-wilds-mh-zoh-shia-crystals-farm-1851781913">toughest hunts</a></span>, but every little bit helps. Just remember to look away before the end of her last performance. The shift between the night and morning phases is incredibly fast. While it’s cool for her to disappear with the rising sun, getting blinded by it isn’t as cool.</p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
