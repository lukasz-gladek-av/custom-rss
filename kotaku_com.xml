              <p>Harry Potter LEGO sets usually cost a fortune because the Wizarding World license commands premium pricing on everything it touches. Most detailed Harry Potter builds run well over $100 and puts them out of reach for casual fans who just want a cool display piece.<strong> Hagrid’s Hut</strong> finally brings an iconic location from the films into an affordable price range that makes sense for gift-giving or treating yourself: <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4867/">Amazon just dropped this 891-piece set from its usual $74 price down to just $47 for an early Black Friday deal</a>. That’s an all-time low that makes one of LEGO’s highest-rated Harry Potter sets cheaper than a video game.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4867/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>



<p>The set includes seven minifigures that recreate the memorable scene when Harry, Ron, and Hermione visit Hagrid’s hut for the first time. You’ll get Harry Potter, Hermione Granger, Ron Weasley, Draco Malfoy, and Rubeus Hagrid as buildable characters, plus LEGO figures of Norbert the baby dragon and Fang the boarhound. These minifigures feature detailed printing on their torsos and legs that catches each character’s signature clothing from the first film. The dragon element adds a nice touch since Norbert’s hatching represents one of the most memorable moments from that early Hogwarts chapter.</p>



<h2>Removable Roof and Opening Walls</h2>
<p>LEGO designed Hagrid’s hut with a <strong>removable roof and hinged walls that open for complete access to interior details</strong>. You won’t have to fiddle with fitting minifigures in some cramped spot, as you do with some sealed building sets. Detailed inside features include Hagrid’s oversized fold-out chair, which befits his half-giant stature, an umbrella stand with his pink umbrella hiding his broken wand, and the dragon egg element so essential to the story.</p>



<p>It contains<strong> two gold-colored portrait elements of various characters and paintings</strong> from around the castle, randomly selected from 14 different kinds of Hogwarts portraits. It encourages fans to purchase more than a single set to fill up their collection. In this set, you could arrange these portraits inside the hut or use them to customize other Harry Potter LEGO builds</p>
<p>The included doghouse features a detached building in which Fang, Hagrid’s loyal companion, can reside. This smaller build complements the main hut and adds play value by giving younger builders an additional construction project. The doghouse features appropriate details to match the rustic and cobbled-together aesthetic of Hagrid’s main dwelling.</p>
<p>The price-to-piece ratio at $47 delivers excellent value compared to other licensed LEGO sets within this size range.</p>

              <p>Apple never discounts MacBooks on its own website so when the 2025 MacBook Air hit $799 during October’s Prime Day, people rushed to grab it. That felt like the deal of the year until Amazon dropped an even deeper – early – Black Friday discount this week: The latest <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5068/">M4 MacBook Air with 16GB of RAM and 256GB SSD storage now sells for just $749, down from its usual $999 price tag</a>. Basically, you’re getting Apple’s newest silicon and premium build quality for less than plastic Dell and HP alternatives.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5068/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>



<p>The M4 chip crushes Intel and AMD processors found in comparative Windows laptops while producing almost no heat. You can edit 4K video, run multiple browser tabs filled with streaming content, and do photo editing all at the same time without hearing any fan noise or feeling warmth through the keyboard. <strong>Apple built the M4 on a 3-nanometer process</strong> that fits more transistors in less space and boosts performance and energy efficiency.</p>
<h2>Best Laptop in 2025</h2>
<p>Apple has bumped the <strong>base configuration to 16GB of unified memory</strong>, up from a standard 8GB in the previous generation. This memory architecture allows the CPU, GPU, and Neural Engine to access the same pool of memory without copying data between discrete components. You’ll jump between dozens of open applications without slowdowns or the spinning beach ball that plagued older Macs with too little RAM.</p>



<p>The<strong> display comes fitted with a 13.6-inch Liquid Retina display</strong> that outputs at 500 nits of brightness and supports a billion colors. Text appears quite razor-sharp at native resolution, making extended reading sessions comfortable without eye strain. The screen covers the P3 wide color gamut that photographers and video editors rely on for accurate color representation.</p>
<p>The <strong>256GB SSD storage provides enough room for an operating system</strong>, essential applications, and a reasonable amount of documents and photos. For large video libraries, you’ll likely want to consider external storage or cloud services, although for most users, <strong>256GB is enough to handle their general computing tasks</strong>. The SSD reads and writes data at speeds that make file transfers and application loading just about instantaneous.</p>



<p>The<strong> battery life extends up to 18 hours for video playback</strong> or web browsing on a single charge. You can work a full day without carrying the charging adapter, then still have power left for evening entertainment. The efficient M4 chip sips power during light tasks, only ramping up performance when you actually need it.</p>
<p><strong>And at just 2.7 pounds</strong>, you barely notice the MacBook in your bag during commutes or travel.</p>
<p>At $749, this MacBook Air is a better price than a comparably specced Dell, HP, or Lenovo Windows laptop. You’ll save $250 off Apple’s regular price, all while still getting their latest and greatest tech. <strong>With an impressive 4.8-star rating from over 3,600 reviews</strong>, this laptop exceeds expectations in both build quality and performance.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[This 6-Foot USB-C to USB-C Cable Falls to $4, Now Selling for 8X Cheaper Than Apple’s Option]]></title>
            <link>https://kotaku.com/this-6-foot-usb-c-to-usb-c-cable-falls-to-4-now-selling-for-8x-cheaper-than-apples-option-2000642267</link>

              <p>USB-C cables break or disappear at the worst possible moment and then you’re in a scramble to find backups. Apple sells a single 6-foot USB-C cable on its website for $20-30 which seems outrageous for what’s essentially a wire with some connectors.</p>
<p>Anker builds cables to the same reliability standards that got the brand shelf space in Apple Stores worldwide. And the good news is that <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5399/">Amazon just dropped a 2-pack of Anker’s 6-foot USB-C to USB-C cables from $15 down to just $8</a>, hitting an all-time low price. You <strong>get two premium charging cables for less than a quarter of what Apple charges for one</strong>, and it costs roughly $4 for each cable.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5399/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>



<p>Each of these <strong>cables supports 100W power delivery</strong> when connected with a compatible charger which means these handle the fastest charging speeds your devices can accept. Your MacBook Pro will charge at full speed without throttling down like cheaper cables that max out at 60W or less. The iPhone 17 series charges rapidly through these when connected to a 20W or higher USB-C power adapter.</p>



<h2>Built to Survive 5,000 Bends Without Failing</h2>
<p>The <strong>braided nylon exterior resists fraying and splitting</strong> at the connector joints where most cables fail first. Anker rated these cables for 5,000 bend cycles, which represents years of daily plugging and unplugging in real-world use. Reinforced strain relief at both ends prevents internal wires from breaking when you wrap cables for storage or accidentally yank them.</p>



<p>The length of <strong>6 feet</strong> gives you flexibility to charge devices while actually using them comfortably. Shorter 3-foot cables, on the other hand, just make you sit right next to wall outlets or power banks, which proves awkward when you want to use your phone in bed or on a couch. This length reaches from floor outlets to desk height with ease or reaches from a nightstand charger onto your bed without stretching tight.</p>
<p>Anker supports all these<strong> cables with a lifetime warranty</strong> that covers defects in manufacturing and normal wear failures. They actually honor this warranty hassle-free, often shipping replacement cables without having to ship back failed units first. <strong>Over 23,000 customer reviews averaging 4.7 stars</strong> confirm these deliver reliable performance across different devices and charging scenarios.</p>



<p>The <strong>cables charge at USB 2.0 speeds</strong> while transferring data to enable syncing of files between devices or your phone to a computer. The included hook and loop cable ties keep both cables organized in your bag or drawer rather than tangling into impossible knots.</p>
<p>The price of $8 for two cables is less than a single lunch and solves your charging needs across multiple locations. Keep one cable at your desk and another in your living room, or split the pack with a family member. This all-time low pricing makes stocking up easy and deals this aggressive on genuine Anker products rarely last more than a few days before inventory runs out.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/dji-offloads-premium-mic-mini-bundle-now-cheaper-than-budget-no-name-alternatives-2000642143</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Anyone who makes videos or podcasts for a living knows that the impact of audio comes above just about everything else. Seriously, if your sound quality is good enough, then everything else is often secondary, and that’s why having really good microphones is so important. If you’re looking for an amazing option, then you’ll want to get a good lavalier microphone, because they’re a lot more subtle in appearance while providing excellent sound quality.</p>
<p>Right now, Amazon has a deal on which means that the <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5079/">DJI Mic Mini is currently on sale with 38% off, which means it’s down to $74 for a limited time:</a>&nbsp;It’s normally $119, so that’s a decent discount for sure. Not only that, but <strong>this comes with two transmitters and one receiver</strong>, so you can even use this for duo productions.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5079/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>



<h2>Mic Check</h2>
<p>The microphones here are incredibly light, weighing in at only ten grams, which means that you’ll not only be able to connect them to just about any bit of clothing, but also not be weighed down by them. That means you’ll look better on camera, but it also means you can fine-tune the placement to get the perfect sound quality, no matter what environment you’re recording in.</p>



<p>They also feature amazing noise cancelling, with you being able to switch modes as needed. Basic will get rid of standard noises you’d expect, but strong can handle all sorts of sounds. It means that you’ll be getting crystal clear audio at all times, and that’s really important. The microphones have an amazing range of 400m as well, so you can set this up indoors then go outside to record as needed.</p>
<p>The battery life is also very impressive. You can keep these on for up to 10 hours in total, which means that you can record for an entire work day without any problems. That’s plenty of time for a huge number of takes, interviews, or different video or audio ideas as you need. These are small, mighty, and long-lasting microphones that are sure to make you sound better, no matter what you’re using them for.</p>
<p>This is a brilliant discount, but it’s also one that we’re not expecting to last for very long. So, if you do want to enjoy this amazing price tag, we recommend doing so soon. The $74 could run out at any time, and that means time is of the essence if you want to save big and sound good.</p>
