              <p>Roborock is turning 11, and to celebrate the occasion, they’ve done the impossible: offering a massive price cut on their most powerful and advanced robot vacuum ever. The iconic <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3809/">Saros Z70 vacuum normally costs a whopping $2,599 but is now available just for $1,599</a> on Roborock’s website during the Labor Day holiday weekend.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3809/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Roborock.com</a></p>

<p>If you’re a <strong>tech hobbyist</strong> who’s been dreaming of owning a unique robot vacuum, it’s your time. Not only is this a massive $1,000 off, but it’s also a rare opportunity to purchase it since the device was recently released a few months ago and g<strong>enerated a huge buzz at CES this year</strong>. Getting your hands on this vacuum for that kind of money is a major win.</p>
<h2>Best Robot Vacuum?</h2>
<p>The most unique aspects of the Roborock Saros Z70 is its <strong>OmniGrip mechanical arm</strong>: It’s no standard cleaning arm, and Roborock designed it to perform on different types of floors and move into those tricky corners and edges where dust settles. It cleans with precision and leaves no spot behind. Coupled with its very thin profile—less than 8 centimeters thick—the vacuum smoothly moves under sofas, beds, and other low-clearance furniture. That low profile also means you won’t need to move heavy furniture just to clean your space, which is a huge plus for anyone who hates extra work.</p>
<p>The <strong>StarSight Autonomous System</strong> navigation system on the vacuum works with a combination of cameras and sensors to map your space with great accuracy. This tells the Saros Z70 exactly where it’s already been and where it still needs to vacuum, and avoids obstacles like furniture legs and walls. It even has a double anti-tangle system that keeps it from getting caught on cables or rugs, something far too common in other robot vacuums.</p>



<p>Perhaps the strongest spec is the suction power: At <strong>22,000 Pa HyperForce</strong>, the vacuum draws in dirt, dust, and debris with virtually unbeatable power. Most vacs for consumers, for instance, hover between 5,000 to 12,000 Pa, so this is a whole different story. It performs beautifully on carpets and picks up pet hair and crumbs, and it’s gentle enough not to damage wooden or tile floors. The Saros Z70 further features the <em>AdaptiLift</em> chassis complemented by FlexiArm riser technology: These enable it to adjust its height and grip to offer a clean one even on an uneven surface without hurting sensitive flooring.</p>
<p>Roborock also packed in the <strong>Multi-functional Dock 4.0</strong> to ensure that maintenance is easy: The smart dock charges the device not just that, but also vacuums the dustbin and refills the water tank for mopping, and removes from you the time consumed by maintenance. It’s the optimal combination of convenience and efficiency that has your vacuum at your command whenever you are ready to get to work. It means roughly seven weeks of handsfree cleaning.</p>
<p>The Roborock Saros Z70 is a real game-changer for home cleaning, and with the price cut (from $2,599 to $1,599), it’s a deal that’s tough to beat.</p>

<p>What’s more, it has fast Wi-Fi for video conferencing and cloud access without lag, and the ports have everything you require: USB-C 3.2, USB-A, HDMI 1.4 for external displays or projectors, headphone/microphone combo jack, and an SD card reader for fast data transfers.</p>



<p>Along with the hardware, Dell also includes a <strong>6-in-1 accessory kit (worth $199) that adds real value</strong> including a USB-C Hub, 3-in-1 charging cable, USB-C cable, and Bluetooth earbuds. It’s ready to go right out of the box with Windows 11 Pro pre-installed so you can get right to work.</p>

              <p>The internal SSD market doesn’t have a ton of options if you want a powerful drive, but Samsung is definitely leading the race right now. If you’re looking for a 2TB SSD that offers serious speed at a reasonable price point, <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3807/">Samsung’s 990 EVO Plus just dropped to an all-time low price on Amazon at only $119, down from $176</a>. That’s a crazy good deal compared to similar drives from Crucial or WD_Black that go for $129 to $189 right now. Plus, it’s getting <strong>rave reviews with a solid 4.8 out of 5 stars</strong>, so it’s definitely worth a look.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3807/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Insane Speed</h2>
<p>This Samsung 990 EVO Plus has a <strong>PCIe Gen 4×4 interface</strong> and features <strong>read speeds of up to 7,250 MB/s</strong>. What does that do for you? Quick game loading, quick file transfer, and apps in a flash, cutting down on waiting time big time. It’s an M.2 2280 size, basically saying it will be compatible with nearly any new laptop or desktop available. Samsung also uses something called HMB Technology which allows the drive to manage its memory smoothly.</p>
<p>The drive also has Intelligent Turbowrite 2.0 which boosts write speeds when you most need them. That’s a nice little kick when you’re copying data or moving files around, so the whole system feels nippier as time goes on while the drive smartly learns about how you use it. This’s not necessarily about raw speed: it’s about keeping your system responsive and efficient. And let’s be honest, Samsung’s all about quality, so this SSD is well-ventilated and won’t drain your battery even if you’re using it hard.</p>



<p>Worried about how long it will last? This SSD is built to endure. It includes a high Total Bytes Written (TBW) rating, which is just geek speak for “it can write a whole lot of data throughout its lifetime,” so you can game, work or store a gazillion files without fear. Samsung also offers great software utilities that let you keep tabs on your drive’s health and optimize its performance easily.</p>
<p>At this cost and with Samsung’s impeccable track record, the 990 EVO Plus 2TB SSD is a deal that won’t leave you disappointed.</p>
