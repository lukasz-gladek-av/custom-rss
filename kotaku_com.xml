              <p>Losing your keys, wallet or luggage creates instant panic and wastes hours of your day retracing steps or tearing apart your house. Apple’s AirTag solves this problem by turning everyday items into trackable objects through the <em>Find My</em> network. A single AirTag usually costs $29 but <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3844/">Amazon’s early Black Friday deal brings a 4-pack down to $64 from the usual $99 price</a>. That’s $16 per tracker instead of $29.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3844/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>How AirTags Work in Real Life</h2>
<p>Each <strong>AirTag pairs with your iPhone or iPad with just a tap</strong> during setup, and immediately shows up in the Find My app amongst the rest of your Apple devices. An integrated speaker plays a sound whenever you trigger it through the app to help you locate items that are wedged between the couch cushions or deep in your bag. You can also ask Siri where your keys or wallet are, and the associated AirTag will start to beep-beep-beeping without your needing to open any apps.</p>



<p>The real magic happens when your item leaves Bluetooth range which extends about 30 feet in open space. Apple’s Find My network leverages hundreds of millions of iPhones, iPads, and Macs around the world that anonymously detect nearby AirTags and report their location back to you in a crowdsourced way. This kind of tracking works passively in the background on other people’s devices without them knowing or needing to do anything.</p>



<p>Lost Mode is the feature that turns on when you mark an item as missing in the Find My app. Immediately,<strong> the AirTag will alert you when any device in the Find My network detects it</strong>, and that provides real-time updates on where the item might be. You can also include a phone number with the AirTag, allowing a person who finds your lost item simply to tap their iPhone or any other NFC-capable smartphone on it and display your contact information to get in touch with you to return it.</p>
<p>The sharing feature lets <strong>up to five people track a single AirTag</strong>, which is perfect for household items that multiple family members use. Your partner can locate the shared car keys just as easily as you can, and everyone gets notifications if the item gets left behind. Each AirTag runs on a replaceable CR2032 battery that lasts about a year before needing replacement, and the Find My app notifies you when the battery runs low. The<strong> trackers are rated IP67 for water and dust resistance</strong> which means they survive splashes and brief submersion up to 1 meter for 30 minutes.</p>
<p>At $16 per AirTag in this 4-pack versus $29 individually, you’re getting the coverage you actually need at a price that makes sense.</p>

              <p>Most people can’t justify dropping $2,000 on a laptop, especially when reliable performance for basic tasks like browsing, video calls, and document work will suffice. That’s where HP’s 15.6-inch touchscreen laptop hits (Intel Core i3, 32GB RAM, 1TB SSD), right between capability and affordability: Right now, <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5291/">it’s selling for $626, slashed from its usual price of $1,999</a>. That’s a discount of $1,373 that brings professional-grade specs within reach, and HP sweetens the deal even further with $299 worth of bonus accessories.</p>

<h2>Built for Everyday Computing</h2>
<p>The Intel Core i3-1315U processor brings six cores to the table: performance cores for handling demanding tasks and efficiency cores for managing background processes. This 12th-generation chip reaches speeds up to 4.5GHz when you need some extra power.</p>



<p>That 32GB of DDR4 RAM is the real game-changer here: Most budget laptops ship with 8GB or maybe 16GB, which forces you to close applications constantly to avoid lag. This much memory future-proofs the machine by ensuring that it stays fast as software becomes more demanding over the course of several years.</p>
<p>With 1TB SSD storage, you can install your operating system, applications, photos, and videos including a music library without having to go through the inconvenience of deleting files or managing external drives. Solid-state drives load Windows and applications in seconds, while old-school hard drives take minutes.</p>



<p>The 15.6-inch HD screen adds intuitive interaction to your daily workflow. You can tap icons, swipe through photos, pinch to zoom in documents, and scroll through web pages with your fingers. Touch makes Windows 11 feel more natural and instinctive, especially for creative tasks or casual browsing. The HD resolution provides clear text and snappy images for spreadsheets, presentations, and video playback, even if it’s not quite as crisp as Full HD screens on pricier models.</p>
<p>It comes pre-installed with Windows 11 Pro which gives you access to features you don’t find in any Home edition, such as BitLocker encryption to keep sensitive files safe, Remote Desktop to access your laptop from elsewhere, and enhanced security tools designed for business. Thanks to fast charging technology, it gets your battery back to practical levels in a short time and minimizes any downtime when working on the go.</p>
<p>The <strong>$299 accessory kit that accompanies this deal</strong> throws in some practical extras, such as a laptop sleeve to keep it protected on the go, a wireless mouse for easier navigation, and other niceties that would cost you extra otherwise. For $626, this HP laptop gets you the specs and features most people actually need without the premium price tag.</p>
