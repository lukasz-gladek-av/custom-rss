              <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/super-mario-galaxy-movie-direct-yoshi-birdo-baby-2000662854"><i><span>The Super Mario Galaxy Movie</span></i></a> <span>is coming out in April, and naturally it’s getting novelty popcorn buckets like every other movie in theaters these days. It looks like Nintendo and Illumination are leaning hard into </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/yoshi-classon-avenue-g-train-station-tracks-tiktok-2000650930"><span>Yoshi</span></a><span> for </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/your-first-look-at-yoshi-in-the-mario-galaxy-movie-comes-from-a-box-of-cookie-dough-2000642406"><span>marketing for the animated sequel</span></a><span>, so they’re making a popcorn bucket of the egg-pooping dinosaur for folks to buy. And my guy looks like he is zooted out of his goddamn mind.</span></p> <p><span>Images of the popcorn bucket started circulating today ahead of any official announcement. You can see Yoshi holding one of his trademark eggs, but he also is giving the kind of thousand-yard stare usually reserved for people who ate an entire bowl of brownies without realizing they’re loaded with pot. He’s staring into the </span><i><span>Super Mario Galaxy</span></i><span> and holding onto that egg like it’s grounding him to reality. It’s currently rumored that this container will be available at AMC, Cinemark, and Regal theaters, but we’re still waiting on an official announcement.</span></p>

Just look at all the nonsense they put out for </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/wicked-for-good-popcorn-buckets-theaters-music-box-song-2000647297"><i><span>Wicked: For Good</span></i></a><span>.</span></p> <p><i><span>The Super Mario Galaxy Movie </span></i><span>is coming to theaters on April 1, and Illumination says that all the animation for the film is complete. We still don’t know who’s voicing Yoshi in the sequel, but he sounds pretty much as cute as you’d expect him to in the trailers. Other newcomers include Brie Larson as Rosalina and Benny Safdie as Bowser Jr. Birdo appeared in one of the more recent trailers as well, but we haven’t heard her speak yet.</span></p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/call-of-duty-devs-know-safeguard-has-problems-and-are-looking-into-it-2000668703</link>
            <guid>1435834</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Over a decade ago, <em>Call of Duty: Black Ops III</em> introduced a new multiplayer game mode to the franchise: <a href="https://callofduty.fandom.com/wiki/Safeguard_(game_mode)">Safeguard</a>. This team-based mode had players pushing and defending a walking robot from another team tasked with stopping it. It was very good. But the mode’s last appearance in a main game was in 2018. So I was over the moon to see the mode return as part of <em>Black Ops 7</em>‘s second season. And while I have some issues with it, Safeguard is still a lot of fun in 2026.</p> <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-review-campaign-is-it-good-zombies-multiplayer-2000645198">Booting up Safeguard in the new season of <em>COD: BLOPS7</em></a> was like returning to an old friend’s house after years away to hang out. Something I’ve always appreciated about the mode was how it gave the defense a way to fight back that wasn’t just “Kill the other team.” You can instead focus your damage on the robot, and if you do enough, it will stop moving and have to reboot. This gives less skilled players a way to help without having to hunt down highly skilled <em>COD</em> pros each match. It also leads to an interesting dynamic where a defending team can over-focus on taking out the bot and let the attackers flank them and wipe them out. But focus too much on the attackers, and the bot will walk its way into the checkpoint, and you’ll lose before you realize it.</p>

  <p>This time around, the robot you are defending is a four-legged Boston Dynamics-like mechanical dog. The bots were previously bipedal humanoids, which was fine, but I’m far more into guarding a robo dog than a random mechanical man. But it felt to me as if this robot dog might be moving faster than the past bots had in Safeguard. So I talked to the devs behind the mode, and they confirmed that, no, the bot is moving at a “pace consistent with previous” versions of Safeguard.</p> <p>However, “<em>BO7</em>’s tighter map layouts, updated pathing, and the new animation set can make its movement feel faster, even though the underlying speed hasn’t changed much,” said a Treyarch spokesperson. They also confirmed they are looking at data to decide if the bot should move a bit slower.</p>

 <p>Another issue with the current version of Safeguard in <em>Black Ops 7</em> is that you can sometimes win, but still lose. Basically, the game mode is built around how fast you get the bot to the checkpoint. Each team gets a shot at pulling this off. If the first team does it in let’s say two minutes, then the other team goes, and if they get the bot there in two minutes and three seconds, <a href="https://youtu.be/LegP5qViODY">they’ll lose despite the bot making it to the checkpoint</a>. This feels bad, and Treyarch tells me they are looking into this.</p>

 <p>“We’re evaluating options to end the second round early in situations where the attacking team hasn’t pushed the Robot far enough in time,” Treyarch told <em>Kotaku</em>. “And we’re looking at this alongside the broader UI improvements already in progress. Our goal is to make the rules and win conditions as clear and intuitive as possible for all players.” The team is also open to bringing back overtime, which isn’t included in Safeguard right now.</p> <p>Besides those issues, and an odd bug that let people knock the bot out with a combat axe that has already been patched, I’ve really enjoyed playing Safeguard again. I think it’s a great example of how <em>Call of Duty</em>‘s gunplay can be incredibly successful in modes that aren’t simply about killing each other.</p>

 <p>I hope the mode sticks around past season two and, like Kill Confirmed and other fan favorites, return in future <em>Call of Duty</em> games. You don’t even have to have a robot for this mode to work. If the next <em>Call of Duty</em> isn’t set in the future but instead WW2 or something, fine, use a jeep. That would still let me enjoy this mode with my friends, even those who aren’t great at FPS games.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><span>Cool stuff is always coming out of the alternative controller community. From rhythm games where you wiggle around on </span><a href="https://scrape.nugget.fun/"><span>a real skateboard</span></a><span> to games where you smack </span><a href="https://www.dachu-interactive.com/how-to-pet-your-cat"><span>a giant stuffed animal cat butt</span></a><span>, the world of weird controllers is awesome and underrated. Luckily, a brand new type of alt control is getting some well-deserved love.</span></p> <p><span>Streamer Perri Karyal is </span><a href="https://youtu.be/rIbfNUA5pWk?si=ZHmAQQDUcdhWQfk2"><span>known</span></a><span> for making alt controls that allow her to play games using her brain—but what if it were the other way around? What if a game could control a player?</span></p> <p><span>On Thursday, Karyal </span><a href="https://x.com/perrikaryal/status/2022045170154328538?s=20"><span>posted</span></a><span> a video showing off exactly that. Using a process called galvanic vestibular stimulation (GVS), which basically sends signals to the part of your ear canal that’s responsible for your sense of balance, Karyal was able to hook up her own body to a controller.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">I can control your balance</p> <p>I made a device that sends DC current through my head to stimulate my vestibular nerve (called galvanic vestibular stimulation or GVS) and, in doing so, can make me feel completely destabilised. By changing the direction of the current, it can make me… <a href="https://t.co/XNH0EtRow6">pic.twitter.com/XNH0EtRow6</a></p> <p>— Perri (@perrikaryal) <a href="https://twitter.com/perrikaryal/status/2022045170154328538?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">February 12, 2026</a></p></blockquote>  <p><span>“By changing the direction of the current, it can make me fall in that direction,” she explains. The video shows Karyal running in a straight line — until a person shifts a joystick to the left, which causes her to veer to the left, too.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>Karyal proceeded to use the tech to simulate G forces while playing Ubisoft’s 2020 racing game </span><i><span>Trackmania.</span></i><span> In the video, she sways from side to side in tandem with her digital car, to dizzying effect. She also reports seeing “flashing lights,” which doesn’t sound too good. The official </span><i><span>Trackmania</span></i><span> Esports account </span><a href="https://x.com/TMesports/status/2022169923741741070?s=20"><span>took notice</span></a><span> of Karyal’s experiment, calling it “awesome.”</span></p>

 <p><span>The technology that makes this possible is actually quite old. In an NBC article from 2005, journalist Yuri Kageyama </span><a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/id/wbna9816703"><span>tries out GVS</span></a><span>: “I found the experience unnerving and exhausting: I sought to step straight ahead but kept careening from side to side. Those alternating currents literally threw me off.”</span></p>

 <p><span>Perri Karyal stresses not to replicate this experiment at home, as GVS isn’t very well-researched and can cause adverse effects. It’s very cool to watch someone else do it, though!</span></p>

            <title><![CDATA[Meowth Will Gargle Your Pinballs For Just $7,000]]></title>
            <link>https://kotaku.com/stern-pinball-pokemon-table-price-7000-release-trailer-pikachu-meowth-2000668725</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>After some teasing last week, Stern Pinball has officially unveiled its pricey <a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-day-firered-leafgreen-switch-2-port-eshop-online-2000668213"><em>Pokémon</em></a>-themed tables with a snazzy trailer. The question now is: Are you willing to pay $7,000 to fling steel balls at Meowth’s face?</p> <p>On February 13, Stern Pinball released a new trailer showing off its $7,000 <em>Pokémon</em> table, which features a large HD screen that plays clips from the anime series as well as a highly interactive playfield that includes a moving Pikachu and a Meowth balloon. Here’s the video:</p>  <p>Stern says players will be able to capture Pokémon while playing this pinball machine. And if you have a Stern account and log in via the app while playing, you’ll be able to collect Pokémon and check them out later on the app. As you’d expect from a modern pinball machine, the playfield is jam-packed with spinners, ramps, and targets to hit, all of which will cause Pikachu to react to how you’re playing.</p>

 <p>“Today we’re proud to finally deliver the long-awaited&nbsp;<em>Pokémon</em> by Stern Pinball machine,” <a href="https://sternpinball.com/game/pokemon/">said Stern Pinball president</a> and CEO Seth Davis in a press release. “This game is a true celebration of nostalgia, craftsmanship, and the enduring adventure of Pokémon – brought to life in a whole new way through immersive pinball gameplay, thrilling battles, and the timeless excitement of catching <em>Pokémon</em>.”</p> <p>This all sounds cool, and if you find one at your local arcade or bar, it will likely be a lot of fun. However, if you want to buy one of these machines to stick in your basement or gaming room, you’ll need to drop at least $7,000 on the base model. There’s also a premium model that features different artwork, enhanced audio and visuals, and a fancier backglass, among other bonuses. Those don’t come cheap. This upgraded version will cost $9,700. Meanwhile, a limited-edition version of the table will set you back $13,000!</p>

 <p>If you can afford to grab this <em>Pokémon</em> table, first off, congrats on doing well in life. <a href="https://sternpinball.com/game/pokemon/">And also, Stern is taking orders for its newly revealed <em>Pokémon</em> pinball machine right now on its website.</a></p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/mewgenics-voice-actor-credits-meows-ethan-hila-klein-2000668734</link>
            <guid>1435732</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/mewgenics-edmund-mcmillen-roguelike-impressions-2000666865"><i><span>Mewgenics</span></i></a><span>, the new tactical RPG roguelike about cat breeding, has come under a bit of fire during its launch week for its long list of voice cameos. Among </span><a href="https://www.mobygames.com/game/252481/mewgenics/credits/windows/"><span>the eclectic group</span></a><span> of people who do the various “meow”s in the game are a fair number of content creators, including husband-and-wife podcast hosts Ethan and Hila Klein, both of whom have expressed </span><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qidsNawR9TE"><span>pro-Israel views in regards to its ongoing conflict with Palestine</span></a><span>. Hila was born in Israel and was required by law to </span><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ytOl5hbTrCY"><span>serve in the Israel Defense Forces at 18,</span></a><span> albeit not in a combat role. After some criticism of their presence in the game on social media, the developers have responded.</span></p> <p><span>In an interview with </span><a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/edmund-mcmillen-on-assembling-mewgenics-meow-cameo-list-the-inclusion-of-people-with-clashing-ideologies-felt-appropriate"><i><span>Rock Paper Shotgun</span></i></a><span>, developer Edmund McMillen explained that the giant list of meowers was accumulated over several years, with Ethan Klein’s contribution coming together four years before the game launched.</span></p> <p><span>“I wanted the game to feature a huge array of iconic voices I’ve been hearing echoing across the internet for most of my time making games,” McMillen told </span><i><span>RPS</span></i><span>. “As some probably noticed I was [pretty] all over the place when it came to cameos and did my best to include and keep ones that clashed or kinda counterbalanced each other.”</span></p>

 <p><span>This counterbalancing, as McMillen calls it, means recruiting people with different views, such as iDubbbz and Anisa Jombha, who have </span><a href="https://x.com/overzealots_/status/2018074085964575102"><span>publicly supported Palestine</span></a><span>, to balance out people like Klein. iDubbbz and Klein have been </span><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NyB85pVw-v4"><span>publicly feuding</span></a><span> after the former released a video criticizing the latter’s stance on Israel. McMillen says he contacted both parties before </span><i><span>Mewgenics</span></i><span>’ launch to make sure they knew the other would be in the game.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>Now that </span><i><span>Mewgenics </span></i><span>has </span><a href="https://www.resetera.com/threads/mewgenics-has-some-problematic-meows-ethan-klein-hila-klein.1431916/"><span>gotten pushback for including Klein</span></a><span>, he says it’s “sad” that some might be “</span><span>so put off by the idea of an inclusion of someone they don’t like so much that they will never play the game,”</span><span> though he doesn’t engage with the fact that at the heart of this disagreement is a literal genocide.</span></p>

 <p><span>“I understand we live in a time where a meow from someone who has different beliefs as you is scary and frustrating, confusing and controversial…” McMillen said, “but it felt interesting so I decided to explore it. Also, I should probably point out that I don’t share the same opinions as, well, probably any of the people we included. If I only included people who share the same exact opinions as me, I’d be the only one meowing in the game.”</span></p>

 <p><span>McMillen says that someone who was bothered by a “problematic meow” would probably not enjoy </span><i><span>Mewgenics </span></i><span>anyway, though he says that if you do still play the game, you can simply throw any offending cat in the trash and go about your way. </span></p>

It’s all pretty standard turning knobs and flipping switches, though I fear there’s nothing in here that’s going to make anyone who </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/overwatch-jetpack-cat-competitive-ranked-hero-bans-fika-2000668681"><span>hates the chaotic menace that is Jetpack Cat</span></a><span> any happier.</span></p> <p><span>The </span><a href="https://overwatch.blizzard.com/en-us/news/patch-notes/?blzcmp=app"><span>patch notes</span></a><span> aren’t that extensive, as the update seems to be mostly targeting a few pain points in Domina, </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/overwatch-anran-face-comparison-change-voice-fareeha-2000666873"><span>Anran</span></a><span>, Emre, Jetpack Cat, and Mizuki’s kits. </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/overwatch-2-vendetta-reveal-trailer-cinematic-video-2000644926"><span>Vendetta</span></a><span> is also here, and since she was the last hero to join the roster before the big reboot, it makes sense she might still need some tinkering. It’s not all nerfs, though, as Anran and Mizuki have a few buffs in the mix. The full change log is as follows:</span></p>
