This year he was in both <em>Batman: Arkham Shadow</em> and <em>Indiana Jones and the Great Circle</em>.

The result was months of calls, blind audio tests, and even comparisons of the audition recordings to the sound waves of Harrison Ford’s original performances from the movies.</p><p>“I did <em>not</em> want you for this,” he reportedly told Baker during his final audition, “but you won every time.

The Windows update began rolling out earlier this month, and prior to November 21, <em>Star Wars Outlaws</em> was only available through Ubisoft’s proprietary Ubisoft+ launcher. <em>Assassin’s Creed Valhalla</em>, on the other hand, likely has millions of PC players who could potentially face issues if they try to boot the game up in the near future. </p><p>.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
