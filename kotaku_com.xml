You’ll need to have good aim and manage your metal ring resource well, while dealing with his limited mobility (compared to Dr. Strange, the other main tank in Rivals).

Solid damage which is influenced by how far it flies before it hits your enemy.</p><p><strong>Meteor M</strong> (Ultimate - L3+R3) - Magneto flies up into the air, drawing in all projectiles to feed “the sphere,” hit the button again to unleash it on your enemies and make them rue the day they crossed the Master of Magnetism. It will explode if you charge it too long, but it’s not a big problem as you’ll often be trying to use the ability quickly.</p><p><strong>Metallic Curtain</strong> (LT) - Creates a large wall of magnetic force that blocks projectiles. Use it when your health is getting low to protect yourself and nearby allies. Your main damage-mitigating ability, use it often, particularly if you and your allies need breathing room.</p><p><strong>Metal Bulwark</strong> (Right Click / RB) - A shield Magneto can give to his…less sturdy allies. Use it to save a key Dualist or Strategist from being knocked out, and claim any damage they take to feed the rings on your back, empowering Mag-Cannon.</p><p><strong>Iron Bulwark</strong> (B / Circle) - Magneto creates a shield around himself, and converts any damage taken during its duration into metal for the rings on his back. A great way to prepare your Mag-Cannon and mitigate damage. Use it every time it’s available during combat to make life easier for your healers (and yourself).</p><p><strong>Mag-Cannon</strong> (LB) - After charging up the rings on his back, Mag-Cannon unleashes them in a targeted attack, dealing more damage the more rings there are. The fully-powered version knocks enemies back several yards as well. Great for picking off enemies with low health, particularly Strategist characters and Dualists.</p><p><strong>Magnetic Descent</strong> (Passive) - Hold the jump button to float down instead of falling.</p><p><strong>Metallic Fusion</strong> (Team-Up Ability: Y / Triangle) - Teaming up with his daughter, the Scarlet Witch, Magneto gains the ability to power his Iron Volley with a massive sword, dealing more damage.</p><h2 id="h32882"><a id=""></a><strong>How Should I Play Magneto?</strong></h2><p>Magneto is a solid, all-around tank who moves slowly and more deliberately, but who also has several special moves that help him protect himself and his allies, as well as prepare to deal small bursts of damage afterwards. He is a fantastic choice for a Vanguard character, rewarding those who put in the time to truly master his skills.</p><figure id="" data-id="1abe9f598a0e3526884d13ce9a9e7f19" data-recommend-id="image://1abe9f598a0e3526884d13ce9a9e7f19" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Magneto using his shield." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Magneto using his shield." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->NetEase / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="1abe9f598a0e3526884d13ce9a9e7f19" data-recommend-id="image://1abe9f598a0e3526884d13ce9a9e7f19" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Magneto using his shield." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Three chevrons near the middle of the screen represent the rings on Magneto’s back, so keep an eye on them. When they are completely filled and purple, he gains a relatively hard-hitting secondary attack in Mag-Cannon. Use it to pick off low-health healers and DPS to help your team establish dominance in the contested area.</p><p>Keep an eye on your healers and DPS teammates and use your shield to protect vulnerable healers first, particularly when enemies are attacking them in the back of your team. If they are in a good state, you can use the shield on yourself to give the healers more breathing room—particularly if they are Mantis or Loki, who benefit greatly from the extra time to set up damage buffs, deal damage, and create clones, respectively.</p><figure id="" data-id="c5ceb09a66e97289a5ab74307fad799c" data-recommend-id="image://c5ceb09a66e97289a5ab74307fad799c" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Magneto using his ultimate." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Magneto using his ultimate." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->NetEase / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="c5ceb09a66e97289a5ab74307fad799c" data-recommend-id="image://c5ceb09a66e97289a5ab74307fad799c" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Magneto using his ultimate." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Use your ultimate when you want to scatter the enemy group, or as a counter to powerful ultimates like Cloak and Dagger, Invisible Woman, or Punisher. Since it absorbs projectiles, it is a great way to turn the tides, particularly if it also nullifies an enemy ultimate (and potentially the enemy who used it).</p><hr><p>With all these tips in hand, you are prepared to become a true master of magnetism. Good luck!</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

From 2D to 3D, on good hardware and bad, Mario running, jumping, and collecting coins has been a constant not just for Nintendo, but in the fabric of the medium itself, driving it forward, inspiring it, reacting to what’s worked, and pushing back against what hasn’t. </p><p>Trying to rank the<em> Super Mario</em> games is like trying to rank flavors of ice cream. Some are clear favorites. Others are acquired tastes. Most are still better than whatever the alternative is. In putting together this list, which includes input from across <em>Kotaku</em>’s staff, as well as direct contributions from many of us, we tried to consider the games holistically: their historical context, their revolutionary or creative innovations, how well they hold up now, and the impressions they’ve left with us. </p><p>The ranking we arrived at is not beyond reproach and is far from scientific, but it is correct.

Consider this: 11 whole years (!) had passed since the <em>Super Mario</em> series’ last original side-scroller, <em>Yoshi’s Island</em>. You can see why folks were twitchy. As such, Nintendo announcing <em>New Super Mario Bros.</em> for its DS handheld made for a welcome surprise.<br></p><p>The game’s title alone was intriguing: no numbers, no subtitles, just the word “New” attached to the name of the side-scroller that changed everything back in ‘85. Indeed, this “new” <em>Super Mario Bros.</em> attempted something of a return to baseline, jettisoning some of the series’ later complications in favor of more basic <em>Mario</em> action. I wondered if it’d rekindle the deep enjoyment I had derived from the original NES trilogy.</p><p>It did not. While GameCube’s slightly troubled <em>Super Mario Sunshine</em> had exposed some cracks in the edifice, <em>New Super Mario Bros.</em> ended up being the first mainline <em>Mario</em> that felt inessential. Its straightforward level designs and basic run-jump-bop action came off as bland, and its new ideas proved a mixed lot. </p><p>The wall-jumping maneuver was inoffensive, but the new power-ups ranged from “who cares?” to actively detrimental: The mega-mushroom rampages were just mindless spectacle, the mini mushroom was simultaneously too powerful and a frustrating prerequisite for important shortcuts, and the unwieldy blue shell suit actively tried to send you careening off cliffs. I grew bored, and stopped playing around the sixth or seventh world.</p><p><em>New Super Mario Bros.</em> was a solid platform game by most standards and the start of a welcome revival for side-scrolling <em>Mario</em>. But it didn’t measure up to the very high standard of its predecessors. — Alexandra Hall</p><p><strong>Read More: </strong><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/nintendo-chief-mario-is-part-of-gamers-dna-5935721&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/nintendo-chief-mario-is-part-of-gamers-dna-5935721">Nintendo Chief: Mario Is Part Of Gamers’ DNA</a></span></p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="131cbabf6f3c2595d8a247c4818a6a4a" data-recommend-id="image://131cbabf6f3c2595d8a247c4818a6a4a" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="A Game Boy screen displays Mario jumping through a spider tunnel.

For Nintendo’s next trick it introduced the Game Boy, a category-defining new portable cartridge system. The NES had rocketed to success, in part, on the strength of <em>Super Mario Bros.</em>, so Game Boy naturally launched with <em>Super Mario Land</em>, a bite-sized take on the platforming plumber.<br></p><p>Luckily <em>Super Mario Land</em> was quite good—heck, it eventually became the fourth best-selling Game Boy game (18 million!). The physics were kinda wonky, but the tiny Mario ran about nimbly, tossing ricocheting “superballs” at a strange new cast of bomb-shelled turtles, oversized insects, hopping kyonshi zombies, and a literal alien. It even had two mild but pleasant shoot ‘em up stages, in which Mario piloted subs and airplanes in hopes of rescuing a new princess, Daisy.</p><p>It turns out the weirdness was not just from the new platform, but because development was handled by Nintendo producer Gunpei Yokoi’s R&amp;D1 group rather than Shigeru Miyamoto’s EAD. (R&amp;D1 later made <em>Super Mario Land 2</em> and branched off into the <em>Wario</em> series.) <em>Super Mario Land</em> is as off-brand as <em>Mario</em> would ever get, and I’d say the better for it.

Wii</em> offered console players their first full-fledged return to 2D <em>Super Mario</em> action in well over a decade. This second entry in the <em>New Super Mario Bros.</em> series was beefy compared to its handheld predecessor.. The new jump-spin technique added more nuance to navigation and wild, four-player co-op (or was it?) offered a completely different way to enjoy the carefully paced, but sometimes rote levels. If <em>New Super Mario Bros. Wii</em> didn’t quite manage to shed the charges of blandness that dogged the DS game, its heavy helping of chaotic multiplayer mayhem made for a pleasant consolation prize. — Ethan Gach</p><p><strong>Read More:</strong>&nbsp;<span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/new-super-mario-bros-wii-review-go-buy-a-wii-5403839&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/new-super-mario-bros-wii-review-go-buy-a-wii-5403839">New <em>Super Mario Bros.

But when it arrived in 2011, <em>3D Land </em>was one of the best titles for Nintendo’s gimmicky dual-screen handheld.<br></p><p>A game of small but satisfying stages perfect for play on the go, it took a refreshingly different approach to 3D <em>Mario</em> platforming than games like <em>Sunshine </em>and <em>Galaxy </em>had, one rooted more in the design principles of early 2D <em>Mario</em> games. Today in some ways it feels like a strong proof of concept, establishing ideas that would be more fully realized in <em>3D World</em>.

Their largely uninspired level design made the whole series feel like a soulless attempt to cash in on nostalgia for earlier <em>Super Mario</em> side-scrollers, with little understanding of what made people love those games in the first place.<br></p><p>That all went out the window with <em>New Super Mario Bros. U </em>(which, thankfully, is not relegated to the Wii U on which it was first released, having gotten a Switch incarnation in the form of <em>New Super Mario Bros. U Deluxe</em>). Here, at last, was new (and <em>New</em>) <em>Mario</em> platforming with lively, varied levels that also did one of the things Nintendo does best, presenting a fairly easy (but still fun and inventive) challenge that most players of different skill levels can complete to get the satisfaction of “beating Bowser,” while also providing an intensely challenging and rewarding quest for those who wanted to 100% the game and truly test their platforming skills. </p><p>If you overlooked this game because you thought the <em>New </em>series just wasn’t delivering on its promise, you may want to give it a chance. It’s a terrific 2D thrill ride that actually understands what makes the best <em>Mario </em>level design so good, and sometimes even offers up some exciting surprises of its own. — Carolyn Petit</p><p><strong>Read More:</strong> <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/new-super-mario-bros-u-deluxe-the-kotaku-review-1831680503&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/new-super-mario-bros-u-deluxe-the-kotaku-review-1831680503"><em>New Super Mario Bros.

Most people can’t make levels that capture, much less outdo, the simple brilliance of any single level from the first <em>Super Mario Bros</em>.<br></p><p>But the beauty is in that same madness. Nintendo has, for the most part, moved on from 2D <em>Mario</em> games. Why not let players run wild with their own designs? Every so often, someone will put together a world that rivals if not outdoes Nintendo’s own creations.

Its cute little disk seems to taunt, “Oh, you think you’re hot stuff for rescuing the princess? Well, try these levels on for size.” Except here in the west we couldn’t, because the folks at Nintendo apparently deemed this sequel too difficult for foreign markets.<br></p><p>It’s easy to see why. Compared to the challenging but relatively chill original, the Japanese <em>Super Mario Bros. 2</em> is kind of mean. It sets the tone immediately by making the first “power-up” a poison mushroom which kills you. Or a few worlds in, you might find a beanstalk that leads to the sky. In the first game this was cause for celebration, but here your reward is a reverse “warp zone” that sends you all the way back to world 1-1. But don’t fret: In a hilarious example of the game’s twisted version of “mercy,” a small chasm next to the unwanted warp pipe offers the opportunity to dispose of your current Mario should you wish to avoid being sent back. Aw, those softies.</p><div><p>Sadism aside, <em>Super Mario Bros. 2</em> really is more a <em>Super Mario Bros.</em> expansion than a wholly original sequel. A lot of the tile graphics are redone to be uglier, there aren’t many new items or foes, and you need to beat worlds one through eight a whopping eight times to unlock the even harder worlds A through D. Oh, and now Luigi has his different physics.</p><p>Is it good? Sure, in that it’s more <em>Super Mario Bros.</em>, the landmark action game that changed everything. But the west never saw this sequel until it was part of the 1993 SNES remake package <em>Super Mario All-Stars</em>, by which point we’d also experienced the first two <em>Super Mario Land</em> games, <em>Super Mario Bros. 3</em>, and <em>Super Mario World</em>. So many folks, myself included, didn’t get a chance to experience this one fresh out of the oven, and I know I don’t quite appreciate it as much as a result. It’s also not a big leap to suggest that the first <em>Super Mario</em> outing is just plain more appealing to a wider audience. — Alexandra Hall</p></div><p><strong>Read More: </strong><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/super-mario-bros-2-japan-super-mario-bros-2-usa-m-1846717790&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/super-mario-bros-2-japan-super-mario-bros-2-usa-m-1846717790"><em>Super Mario Bros. 2 </em>Japan + <em>Super Mario Bros. 2</em> USA = My Dream Game</a></span></p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="ae183bb0262634b3662f599d4f967beb" data-recommend-id="image://ae183bb0262634b3662f599d4f967beb" data-format="jpg" data-width="1269" data-height="714" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Builder Mario hammers through some blocks.

The content creator playground remains alive and vibrant, for one, which already puts it head and shoulders above the 3DS and Wii U originals. No, the UI experience isn’t quite as good as on the Wii U, whose tablet felt custom-made for crafting new <em>Mario</em> levels. And there are weird oversights and missing features, like no 100-man challenge mode and no ways to track stats or help players easily discover cool creations. The sheer number of new design elements helps make up for that, however. And the new story mode is a drastically better teaching tool that has neat levels of its own. — Ethan Gach<br></p><p><strong>Read More: </strong><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/super-mario-maker-2-the-kotaku-review-1835857984&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/super-mario-maker-2-the-kotaku-review-1835857984"><em>Super Mario Maker 2</em>: The <em>Kotaku</em> Review</a></span></p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="e90ac81a8c54228d88f888dc9e48b1c3" data-recommend-id="image://e90ac81a8c54228d88f888dc9e48b1c3" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Mario smashes Koopa shells underground.

Taito’s <em>Jungle King /</em> <em>Jungle Hunt </em>had it as early as 1982, and gaming’s first true superstar, Pac-Man, got his own cartoonish side-scroller in 1984’s <em>Pac-Land</em>. But nonetheless, to play <em>Super Mario Bros</em>. in 1985 was to know that everything had changed.<br></p><p>It was an absolute revelation to see Mario, previously the star of <em>Donkey Kong </em>and <em>Mario Bros.</em>, bust free from the single-screen confines of the past and run toward the right. A whole world of adventure awaited him, packed with immediately iconic power-ups, unforgettable secrets, a real sense of vastness and depth thanks to subterranean stages, and bonus coin zones hidden in the clouds. </p><p>But of course, none of that would have mattered if <em>Super Mario Bros</em>. didn’t feel so damn good to play. The option to hold down a button to run, the way Mario soared through the air, the sheer bliss of getting an invincibility star and plowing right through rows of goombas and koopas, all of it elevated <em>Super Mario Bros. </em>far beyond any side-scroller that had come before. </p><p>It’s also, for my money, the first game in which Nintendo’s signature, subtly intuitive level design is on display. There’s a reason why world 1-1 remains iconic to this day: Shigeru Miyamoto knew exactly what he was doing, telling you everything you needed to know with just a goomba and one super mushroom. And yet, for all its fundamental simplicity, the game continues to surprise as you progress, introducing nefarious new challenges (those damn hammer bros.!) and capping off each world with a castle so treacherous that surviving leaves you feeling both triumphant and relieved. </p><p>Some might argue that although it kicked off an action-gaming dynasty, the original <em>Super Mario Bros. </em>isn’t worth going back to today. I disagree. I think its level design is timelessly great (unlike that of some games in the <em>New Super Mario Bros. </em>series), its music and visuals are enduringly charming, and its controls as pleasurable and intuitive today as ever. Games that change the landscape of gaming forever are rare, but this is one of them, no question about it. — Carolyn Petit</p><p><strong>Read More: </strong><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/when-we-show-a-power-up-to-mr-miyamoto-we-get-a-bit-n-5861970&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/when-we-show-a-power-up-to-mr-miyamoto-we-get-a-bit-n-5861970">‘When We Show A Power-Up To Mr. Miyamoto, We Get A Bit Nervous.’</a></span></p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="2e27914998a8564ee871971d8f7e8543" data-recommend-id="image://2e27914998a8564ee871971d8f7e8543" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Luigi prepares to jump too far in Super Mario Bros. 2.

The result isn’t always perfect, but it can still often manage to feel revelatory. Mario’s vacation to Isle Delfino Island sees him strap a robotic water pump to his back to clean up goop and rescue Princess Peach from the consequences of Bowser’s poor parenting. Between detailed, open-ended levels and Mario’s new water jetpack, <em>Sunshine</em> transforms where Mario can go and how he gets there.

You can’t jump if you don’t eventually fall, and Nintendo spent decades exploring that in 2D and 3D. <em>Galaxy</em> explored it from the inside out, using Wii motion controls to help you tease it out and feel it deep in your bones, and <em>Galaxy 2</em> took that to another level. — Ethan Gach</p><p><strong>Read More:</strong> <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/nintendo-just-threw-super-mario-galaxy-2-down-the-memor-1844947959&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/nintendo-just-threw-super-mario-galaxy-2-down-the-memor-1844947959">Nintendo Just Threw <em>Super Mario Galaxy 2</em> Down The Memory Hole</a></span></p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="1eb826fa6d22709018a4fd1d50842861" data-recommend-id="image://1eb826fa6d22709018a4fd1d50842861" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Tanooki Mario dodges Bullet Bills.

Getting to see King Koopa’s military might represented across the landscape by forts and castles as your quest took you from the bucolic Grass Land (world 1) all the way to the foreboding, Mordor-like Dark Land (world 8) conjured the sense of a true quest against a vast force of evil, while little touches like the ways the hammer bros. moved around between stages brought that map to life–a real, living world. </p><p>But the game also represented another massive leap for the series (and for platforming games in general) in its level design, with slopes you could slide down, autoscrolling airships lending a formidable new feel to Bowser’s forces, and gimmicks that still surprise and delight to this day, like Giant Land (world 4), in which enemies and environmental features alike are suddenly many times their normal size. </p><p>To top it all off, Mario’s momentum is newly refined—run interrupted for a bit and you attain P-speed, moving faster, leaping farther, and even able to take flight—and he’s got a slew of new power-ups to play with, from the oddball Kuribo’s shoe to the iconic tanooki suit. <em>Super Mario Bros. 3</em> is just bursting with ingenuity and generosity from top to bottom, and upon release utterly destroyed the existing standards for games of this type with all of its inventiveness and fun, seamlessly weaving dozens of great new ideas into one epic adventure. — Carolyn Petit</p><p><strong>Read More: </strong><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/the-making-and-legacy-of-super-mario-bros-3-1773499946&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/the-making-and-legacy-of-super-mario-bros-3-1773499946">The Making (And Legacy) Of<em> Super Mario Bros. 3</em></a></span></p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="90786d10d539fa373cd872917bf7dca1" data-recommend-id="image://90786d10d539fa373cd872917bf7dca1" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Mario rides some dolphins.

The best 2D <em>Mario</em> game Nintendo ever made is thus the best Mario game overall. Elegant and simple yet challenging and complex, the 1990 pack-in launch game for the SNES has aged like a fine Bordeaux: silky smooth and exquisitely harmonized. It controls like a dream. The pixel art still looks great. And each of its 73 levels offers something unique, with puzzles that evolve as new block types are unlocked and even a  visual overhaul once you reach a certain point.<br></p><p>It’s not as daring as <em>Super Mario Bros. 3</em> or as ambitious as <em>Super Mario Galaxy 2</em>, but it’s undoubtedly the most balanced and well-rounded package in the series. Feathers transform Mario into a gravity-defying superhero. Different-colored Yoshi harness various magical abilities from fire balls to mini-earthquakes. And ingenious hidden exists culminate in Star Road, an immaculate series of secret levels whose level of challenge is exceeded only by the amount of imagination on display. </p><p>Each zone on the map tells a story, and each one connects to the next, weaving an adventure that’s minimalistic but evocative, taking Mario over hills, underground, through foggy forests, and across prehistoric mountains. An underappreciated aspect of <em>Super Mario World</em> is how each new level, and new zone, slowly builds upon the last, not just mechanically but thematically as well. There’s no real backstory and hardly any dialogue, and yet each new step and every enemy jumped on carries you along a bit further through the most polished and quintessential <em>Mario </em>adventure ever made. </p><p>At least, for now. — Ethan Gach</p><p><strong>Read More:</strong> <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/unearthed-1990-interview-reveals-great-insights-about-s-1748732983&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/unearthed-1990-interview-reveals-great-insights-about-s-1748732983">Unearthed 1990 Interview Reveals Great Insights About <em>Super Mario World</em></a></span></p></div></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

The large Lego kit is priced at $170 and is made up of over 1,900 pieces. The new build recreates Mario in a go kart and features posable arms. You can pre-order the set starting today and it will be available to buy on May 15.</p><p>The decorative set is intended for adults and older builders. And it’s pretty dang big, too. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.lego.com/en-us/product/mario-kart-mario-standard-kart-72037&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.lego.com/en-us/product/mario-kart-mario-standard-kart-72037" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">According to Lego’s website</a></span>, the <em>Mario Kart</em> set is 8.5 inches high, 12.5 inches long and 7.5 inches wide! You are going to need some space to display this bad boy and all his wonderful details, including what appears to be printed face features and a bulbous nose. </p><p>Seriously, I’m shocked at how perfectly Lego has captured Mario’s face, body, and proportions. Lego bricks can make many things, but human-like figures tend to be the trickiest and yet, Mario looks amazing in this new set. </p><p>In fact, because of how awesome Mario looks as a big brick-built Lego character, I’m just dreaming of a video game that looks like this. It makes me wish Nintendo and Lego would make the plunge and greenlight a Lego<em> Mario</em> video game. Even Bowser looks great as a brick-built character, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/bowser-lego-set-giant-2800-pieces-october-27-nintendo-1849152567&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/bowser-lego-set-giant-2800-pieces-october-27-nintendo-1849152567">as seen in his 2022 set</a></span>.
