The latest entry in the fighting game franchise that eventually spun off <em>King of Fighters</em> is out April 24 on PS5, PS4, Xbox Series X/S, Xbox One, and PC, and can count having the weirdest crossover fighter of all time among its distinctions. </p><p>But the funniest part about Ronaldo being in the next <em>Fatal Fury</em> is that it only vaguely looks like him and seems to be voiced by someone else entirely. At least it doesn’t look as bad as his bronze statue: </p><p>Ronaldo was previously <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-manchester-58528893&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-manchester-58528893" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">accused of rape in 2009</a></span> but reached a settlement with the alleged victim and claimed he was innocent, even though she later came out publicly about the allegations following the 2019 #metoo movement. Why is he now in, of all things, a deep cut 2D fighter from Japanese arcade gaming’s past? It’s probably not just because the developers one day saw players in the <em>Fatal Fury </em>community having fun and decided to <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://x.com/PsychoSWeasel/status/1837901224298889454&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://x.com/PsychoSWeasel/status/1837901224298889454" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">turn those meme dreams into reality</a></span>. </p><p>Ronaldo plays for Al Nassr FC  after agreeing to take leave of Europe and help sportswash Saudi Arabia’s bad human rights record in exchange for over $200 million. Al Nassr FC is 75 percent owned by the Saudi royal investment fund which also happens to have a 96 percent controlling stake in<em> Fatal Fury</em> makers SNK. <br></p><p>“We’re not a political company or anything like that, so it doesn’t affect us in any way,” SNK designer and producer  Yasuyuki Oda said of the Saudi investment when questioned&nbsp;<span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/snk-lead-insists-saudi-arabia-sale-will-have-no-effect-on-the-games-we-make/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/snk-lead-insists-saudi-arabia-sale-will-have-no-effect-on-the-games-we-make/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">by<em> VGC</em></a></span> back in 2022. “It has no–<em>no</em>–effect on our creative output. We have full freedom on what we want to create.” Hmmm.</p><p>I had the chance to play <em>Fatal Fury: City of the Wolves</em> at Summer Game Fest last year and it was shaping up nicely, with a cool comic book art style and a new combat system to give players more offensive options from the start of each match. I can’t say I’m looking forward to playing as Ronaldo, but him being in the game also means getting to beat up on anyone who main’s him. </p><p>.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
