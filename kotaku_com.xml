You can’t murder, and the studio said they’d never include such a mechanic.

With your main character, hop into a vehicle and put the pedal to the metal. Since you can directly control your character using WASD, you can control the vehicle’s path and ram into a secondary Zoi.</p><p>However, and once again, this only works for the Zois under your care. You cannot run down an NPC, for example, or a child any longer.</p><p><strong>Alternatively, you can arrange an unfortunate accident in which your Zoi passes away due to electrocution, a house fire, or starvation</strong>. Okay, so the last one isn’t precisely an accident. But you can continue using old, broken appliances that may lead to a kitchen incident, and if your Zoi doesn’t move away quickly enough (such as when you turn off autonomy), they’ll likely perish in the blaze.</p><h2 id="h678950"><a id="2"></a>All the ways a Zoi can die in <em>inZoi</em></h2><figure id="" data-id="ad19b874780467494a93aa74d374b076" data-recommend-id="image://ad19b874780467494a93aa74d374b076" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="An in-game guide overview of fire hazards in inZOI." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="An in-game guide overview of fire hazards in inZOI." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="false" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Krafton</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="ad19b874780467494a93aa74d374b076" data-recommend-id="image://ad19b874780467494a93aa74d374b076" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="An in-game guide overview of fire hazards in inZOI." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>There are several currently available ways in which a Zoi may perish, including:</p><p><strong>Car accidents</strong></p><ul data-type="List" data-style="Bullet"><li>Should another Zoi ram your current Zoi with their vehicle, either in a car accident or a pedestrian accident, it may lead to an untimely death.</li></ul><p><strong>Fire</strong></p><ul data-type="List" data-style="Bullet"><li>Due to an accident or a busted appliance, a fire can break out in a kitchen and lead to severe injury or death.</li></ul><p><strong>Fall damage</strong></p><ul data-type="List" data-style="Bullet"><li>Should your Zoi slip on a wet surface, the ensuing fall may lead to death.</li></ul><p><strong>Starvation</strong></p><ul data-type="List" data-style="Bullet"><li>Ignoring your Zoi’s needs, specifically their hunger, can lead to starvation over time.</li></ul><p><strong>Sleep deprivation</strong></p><ul data-type="List" data-style="Bullet"><li>Once again, ignoring a need and refusing to allow your Zoi to sleep will lead to sleep deprivation and, in time, death.</li></ul><p><strong>Electrocution</strong></p><ul data-type="List" data-style="Bullet"><li>In the same way as a fire may break out, using a broken appliance or attempting to hack into an ATM may lead to electrocution.</li></ul><p><strong>Old age</strong></p><ul data-type="List" data-style="Bullet"><li>Zois will pass away due to old age, though the age in question varies between characters.</li></ul><p><em>inZOI </em>is available now on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and Windows PC.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

How could I hate on such a precious, friendly little Koopa as he? But you don’t have to play <em>Mario Kart World</em> for long to realize somebody must have pissed in his Cheerios this time around—he is more aggressive than ever, hauling players back onto the race track whenever they put the slightest toe out of line. </p><p>Ram into a barrier along the side of a course? Bam, you’re getting Lakitu’d. Try to cut corners and drive through an open field? There’s a 50/50 chance he’ll be on your ass before you even realize you’re not allowed to go that way. Want to relive that classic shortcut from Mario Circuit 4 dating back to the days of the SNES by hopping that green barrier at the second-to-last bend before the finish line? Get fucked. </p><p>I thought I was alone, but nope, Lakitu is ruining everyone else’s fun too. It’s ironic too, considering <em>Mario Kart World </em>features the series’ most complex and open courses yet, each existing on a full map in which you can drive between the tracks. For a sequel where exploring off the beaten path and grinding on every surface you can find is core to its ethos, <em>Mario Kart World</em> really doesn’t want you living your best, improvised life a lot of the time. It’s especially annoying since Lakitu takes your items and an extra <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/mario-kart-world-coin-farming-tips-vehicles-unlock-1851784093&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/mario-kart-world-coin-farming-tips-vehicles-unlock-1851784093">three coins every time he grabs you</a></span>. </p><p> “Lakitu is a bastard in this game,” wrote SkeletronDOTA on the subreddit. “One time I just drifted slightly wide with a golden shroom and he put me back on the track, and took my golden shroom and bullet with him.” User Chrop responded, “Lakitu seems extremely strict in this game, was playing on Boo Cinema and I flew slightly to the right on the glider section and said no. I was fully able to get back on the track but he didn’t like that I flew a little too far away.”</p><p>It’s not all bad. Lakitu won’t mess with you in Free Roam mode where you can complete the Mario Circuit feather jump shortcut in peace, and there are definitely times where his quick interventions are appreciated. For instance, say, if you <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/mariokart/comments/1l7f75b/uhh_excuse_me/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/mariokart/comments/1l7f75b/uhh_excuse_me/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">start randomly falling</a></span> through the map.

Still, he could use way more overall chill. Maybe <em>Mario Kart World</em>’s next patch will dial him back a bit. For now, Lakitu is way overtuned. </p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

In 2020, BioWare pivoted back to the single-player RPG that would eventually launch on Halloween 2024, but according to <em>Bloomberg</em>’s story, the developer was forced by EA to restructure the live-service version of the game into a single-player, story-driven RPG, rather than being able to go back to the drawing board and start fresh.</p><p><em>Bloomberg </em>says that early playtesters lamented a lack of distinct choices and consequences in earlier builds, and this led to the late implementation of key moments like choosing between <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/dragon-age-veilguard-save-minrathous-treviso-choice-1851686168&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/dragon-age-veilguard-save-minrathous-treviso-choice-1851686168">saving either Minrathous or Treviso</a></span> from a dragon attack, leading to the other metropolis being overtaken by the Darkspawn’s blight for the remainder of the game. Another collection of substantial and consequential choices appeared in<em> The Veilguard</em>’s finale, where the player’s decisions can possibly result in the deaths of their entire party. Apparently, this segment came after BioWare brought in the studio’s <em>Mass Effect </em>team to help get the game across the finish line, which resulted in an “overhaul” of the game’s final missions.</p><blockquote data-type="BlockQuote"><p><em>As the Mass Effect directors took control, they scoffed that the Dragon Age squad had been doing a shoddy job and began excluding their leaders from pivotal meetings, according to people familiar with the internal friction.

But even changes that appeared to improve the game stoked the simmering rancor inside BioWare, infuriating Dragon Age leaders who had been told they didn’t have the budget for such big, ambitious swings.</em></p></blockquote><p>This aligns with previous reporting and statements from BioWare veterans, who have stated that the <em>Dragon</em> <em>Age</em> and <em>Mass Effect</em> teams <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/dragon-age-mass-effect-bioware-david-gaider-anthem-1851776055&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/dragon-age-mass-effect-bioware-david-gaider-anthem-1851776055">had a tense relationship,</a></span> and the fantasy team felt it <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/dragon-age-veilguard-anthem-mark-darrah-youtube-bioware-1851779569&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/dragon-age-veilguard-anthem-mark-darrah-youtube-bioware-1851779569">didn’t receive the same level of support</a></span> as the sci-fi team from BioWare and EA leadership.
