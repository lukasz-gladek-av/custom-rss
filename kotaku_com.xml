            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p data-start="98" data-end="638">Many laptop users rely solely on the hardware built into their machines, and while modern laptops are impressively capable, doing everything on the laptop alone can actually hold you back. Even a 17-inch notebook—considered fairly large by portable-PC standards—still feels small compared to the displays most people use today. External monitors commonly start around 27 inches, offering significantly more screen real estate, and some setups go far beyond that with ultra-wide or even 4K panels that dramatically expand your field of view.</p>
<p data-start="640" data-end="1240">If you spend a lot of time typing at your desk, you might prefer the feel and responsiveness of a mechanical keyboard over your laptop’s built-in keys. Maybe your laptop’s speakers don’t produce the volume or clarity you want, leading you to plug in external ones. Add in a separate microphone for calls, a pair of headphones for focus, or even a drawing tablet if you’re an artist, and suddenly you have an entire desk ecosystem of peripherals that your laptop needs to connect to. The problem? Many modern laptops come with only one or two USB ports—nowhere near enough for all these accessories.</p>
<p data-start="1242" data-end="1579">That’s where a reliable USB hub becomes essential. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5667/">The Anker USB-C docking station fits this role perfectly, and even better, it’s currently available at a significant discount. Right now you can save 38%,</a> which knocks $27 off the original price. Instead of paying $70, you’ll only spend $43—a great deal for the functionality it offers.</p>
<p data-start="1242" data-end="1579">In need of more than one? The two-pack is also on sale for… exactly the same price as buying two individually… How about that?</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5667/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2 data-start="1242" data-end="1579">Extended View with Triple Display</h2>
<p data-start="1581" data-end="2206">This docking station serves as a simple, single-cable solution that helps eliminate desk clutter and keep your workspace tidy. Plug one USB-C cable into your laptop, and suddenly all your accessories—monitors, storage devices, audio gear, and more—are connected at once. The dock supports 4K video output at up to 60Hz through its HDMI port, making it ideal for watching high-resolution content or expanding your desktop across multiple screens. While the USB-C data port doesn’t support video output, the hub includes two HDMI ports plus a VGA port, allowing you to connect as many as three external displays simultaneously.</p>


<p data-start="2208" data-end="2532">Charging is handled impressively well too. The same USB-C connection used for data and displays can also power your laptop. The dock supports up to 80W of passthrough charging, meaning you can leave your original power adapter in your bag. With the hub powering your device, you free up ports and simplify your entire setup.</p>
<p data-start="2534" data-end="2712">File transfers are fast and efficient, thanks to both USB-C and USB-A ports capable of speeds up to 5Gbps. Moving large documents, photos, or videos becomes quick and convenient.</p>
<p data-start="2714" data-end="2937" data-is-last-node="" data-is-only-node="">With its current 38% price drop, the Anker USB-C hub is an excellent value. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5667/">For just $43, you get powerful connectivity, cleaner desk organization, and a smoother overall workflow—all while saving $27 off the regular price.</a></p>

            <title><![CDATA[Monster Hunter Wilds Faces Fresh Criticism Over PC Roadmap And Paid Weapon Skins]]></title>
            <link>https://kotaku.com/monster-hunter-wilds-mhw-tu4-title-update-4-pc-fixed-2000652579</link>
            <guid>1379848</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>It’s been a rough year for <a href="https://kotaku.com/monster-hunter-wilds-review-ps5-open-world-rpg-capcom-1851766113"><em>Monster Hunter Wilds</em></a>, a fun, very streamlined action-RPG bogged down by bad performance on PC and a lackluster cadence of post-launch content. Now Capcom has revealed Title Update 4, the latest free patch aimed at getting the multiplayer grind back on its feet. While it includes the game’s first Elder Dragon, it’s also getting flack for a PC optimization roadmap that drip-feeds fixes and new paid weapon skins that monetize part of the end-game loot chase. Nine months after launch, the latest <em>Monster Hunter</em> sequel still can’t seem to catch a break.</p> <p>Arriving December 16, the <a href="https://www.monsterhunter.com/wilds/en-us/update/ver_01_4/">latest free content drop</a> is headlined by the Elder Dragon Gogmazios, which fans are already preparing to get demolished by. A trailer for Title Update 4 shows the ability for four players to team up with support NPCs to fight Gogma as a party of eight. In addition to new Gogma Artian Weapons, <em>Monster Hunter Wilds</em>‘ end-game grind will also expand with Armor Transcendence upgrades, Arch-Tempered Jin Dahaad strikes, additional support hunters Nadia and Griifin, and new optional quests.</p>

  <p>So far so good! But Capcom’s recent <em>Monster Hunter</em> showcase also revealed the game’s next set of microtransactions, the Cosmetic DLC Pack 4. This one, which isn’t part of the existing $50 Cosmetic DLC Pass, includes, among other things, new Layered Weapon designs for each weapon type. These don’t impact gameplay per se, but they do look, depending on your preference, cooler than what you earn in the game without paying. Fans aren’t stoked. “DLC like this should not exist,” one <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/MonsterHunter/comments/1pjsfwl/cosmetic_dlc_pack_4_layered_armor_and_weapons/">wrote</a> on the subreddit.</p>

 <p>These kinds of ornaments, now increasingly common in other live-service games, are still relatively new to the <em>Monster Hunter</em> series. There was already a big stink in the community when Layered Weapon skins arrived in <em>Monster Hunter Rise</em>. Capcom <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/MonsterHunter/comments/yxq2t4/capcom_have_removed_english_plushie_weapons_video/">even removed a trailer</a> for a paid DLC pack that made weapons look like plushies because it got downvoted so much. As one fan <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/MonsterHunter/comments/1pjt0dt/its_just_stickers_its_just_poses_its_just_stuff/">recently laid</a> out, the microtransaction creep has been unrelenting. “”It’s just stickers…it’s just poses…it’s just stuff for the camp…”</p>

 <h2>Don’t expect <em>Monster Hunter Wilds</em> on PC to get fixed all at once</h2> <p>There’s also the new PC optimization roadmap that Capcom revealed during the showcase. The fixes are good, but long overdue and will be spread across multiple months rather than coming in one fell swoop. The latest performance boost begins with CPU/GPU optimization in December as part of Title Update 4. Then January will add more “PC-specific” improvements to high-resolution texture packs and VRAM usage, as well as new graphics and CPU settings. Further optimization will follow in February with a patch targeting graphical detail to reduce GPU processing loads.</p>

 <p>Does that mean the PC version will finally be in tip-top shape by the one-year anniversary? Some players are skeptical that the December update will make a huge difference and are wondering why Capcom <a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/MonsterHunter/comments/1pjshc0/tu4_optimization_roadmap/">seems to have prioritized</a> other things up to this point. “One whole entire year to get optimizations, this is why all of my hunting buddies have already quit the game,” <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/MonsterHunter/comments/1pjs6o5/details_and_timeline_regarding_the_promised/">wrote</a> one player on the subreddit.</p> <p>In the meantime, Steam ratings for <em>Monster Hunter Wilds</em> have improved from a <a href="https://kotaku.com/monster-hunter-wilds-title-2-patch-notes-steam-reviews-1851785248">true low point over the summer</a>, but only just barely. It still hasn’t broken 70 percent positive. “I waited a long time before putting out a review of this game,” <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2246340/Monster_Hunter_Wilds/#app_reviews_hash">reads</a> one recent Steam review from a player with nearly 300 hours logged. “Please understand that I’ve been with this series since 2007, so I have an attachment to it unlike any other game series I’ve immersed myself in. To get to the point; Capcom is ridiculous for putting this game out the way they did.”</p> <p>The long road to redemption for the PC release continues.</p>

              <p><span>It was a good thing that the internet bullied Paramount into fixing </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/the-sonic-the-hedgehog-movie-looks-uh-1834411263"><span>Sonic’s horrifying human-like form</span></a><span> in the first live-action </span><i><span>Sonic the Hedgehog</span></i><span> movie. If that hadn’t happened, we likely wouldn’t have gotten the great follow-ups and Keanu Reeves playing Shadow in </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/sonic-hedgehog-3-review-shadow-keanu-reeves-jim-carrey-1851726797"><i><span>Sonic the Hedgehog 3</span></i></a><span>. But even five years later, who wouldn’t be morbidly curious to know what the movie would have looked like if Paramount hadn’t gone back to the drawing board? That’s what a fan group is giving us the chance to find out with </span><i><span>Sonic the Hedgehog: The 2019 Cut</span></i><span>.</span></p> <p><span>The fan remake of the 2020 film aims to recreate every shot of the movie, but with the ugly-ass hedgehog that Paramount nearly unleashed into theaters. Originally, the team of fans was going to release a trailer this week, but it has been delayed until December 24 because they weren’t “completely happy” with the final result.</span></p>

 <p><span>“We wanted Sonic’s animation to feel as fluid as possible, and to be honest, it would have gotten some negative reviews if we’d released it today,” the announcement reads.&nbsp;</span></p> <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="zxx" dir="ltr"><a href="https://t.co/vYuGKoGXDr">pic.twitter.com/vYuGKoGXDr</a></p> <p>— A26 (@A26Pics) <a href="https://twitter.com/A26Pics/status/1998924804326621228?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 11, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <p><span>To make up for the delay, the </span><i><span>2019 Cut </span></i><span>team released a brief first look showing ugly Sonic running on the inside of a washing machine, and yep, that really does look like that monstrosity in a scene from the final movie. Gross!</span></p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/dji-adds-another-mini-drone-deal-to-amazons-year-end-clearance-as-the-flip-rc-n3-crashes-to-its-lowest-price-2000652303</link>
            <guid>1379761</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>If you like sharing your adventures with the world and are ready to go beyond what your smartphone or a traditional camera can shoot, you need a high-quality drone camera in your setup. These don’t come cheap, but Amazon is making it easier than ever to pick one right now.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6348/">The DJI Flip (RC-N3) drone with a 4K camera, which usually sits at $439, is currently going for just $349 at the retailer.</a> That’s after a nice, and quite rare, 21% drop. This is also the lowest we have seen this drone drop to in a long while. The deal is open to all shoppers, but it wraps up soon. We recommend getting your orders in sooner, before that happens.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6348/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Dynamic Angles, Six Shooting Modes</h2>
<p>Don’t let the look overwhelm you. At just under 249 g, it’s a lightweight drone that doesn’t need FAA registration or Remote ID in America. It’s convenient to travel with, and much easier than most models on the market to use. You can choose between multiple shooting modes for different types of adventures. Getting started couldn’t be simpler; just unfold the arms of the drone, select your desired shooting mode, and send it off.</p>
<p>The foldable propeller guard offers ultra-reliable close-up coverage for when you want to take a detailed look at something, while subject tracking keeps you the center of attention, always. Flip offers MasterShots and six Quickshot modes that deliver simplified cinematic footage for dynamic angles. The modes include Drone, Circle, Rocket, Spotlight, Helix, and Boomerang. Maybe go for the circle mode when you’re trying to capture your furry friend, and the Helix mode during some early morning outdoor walks! Stabilization comes from the 3-axis mechanical gimbal, plus up to level-5 wind resistance. These come together to provide smooth footage, even in chaotic, windy environments.</p>



<p>Picture quality is stunning, thanks to the large 1/1.3-inch CMOS sensor that’s capable of capturing more light for clearer images with vivid detail. Similarly, 4K/60fps HDR gets you breathtaking videos where every little detail is taken care of. The drone also supports vertical crops at 2.7k resolution; great for sharing your adventures on social media instantly. Even better, the dedicated app comes with beautification features that edit the shots on its own when exporting the footage. What’s more, the camera records audio with noise reduction via your phone. It does a good job of focusing on your audio while cutting out background distractions, but for an even better experience, it’s best to pair the drone with a DJI mic (sold separately).</p>
<p>You’ll also enjoy up to 44000 feet/13 km of 1080/60fps video transmission. Pair that with a battery that lasts up to 31 minutes on a single charge, and explore far-off areas without a worry. The DJI Fly app makes managing the drone easy, and also supports voice control for when you’re not in the mood to tweak settings manually. Just say something like “Hey Fly, follow me” or “Hey Fly, start recording”, to begin. The box includes the DJI Flip, DJI RC-N3 remote controller, one Intelligent Flight Battery, and more.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6348/">This deal brings the price of this top-rated drone camera down to $349, making the upgrade quite affordable.</a> You might also be able to enjoy free delivery with your purchase if you order today.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Disney Is Feeding Your Favorite Characters To The OpenAI Woodchipper For $1 Billion]]></title>
            <link>https://kotaku.com/disney-open-ai-sora-deal-star-wars-frozen-2000652583</link>
            <guid>1379758</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><span>The Walt Disney Company and tech bro Sam Altman’s OpenAI have signed a massive deal that will allow users to create AI slop videos centered around their favorite Disney characters starting early next year.</span></p> <p><span>News of the $1 billion deal (h/t </span><a href="https://variety.com/2025/digital/news/disney-openai-deal-200-characters-to-sora-video-invests-1-billion-1236606401/"><i><span>Variety</span></i></a><span>) comes just days after Altman was on Jimmy Fallon’s </span><i><span>The Tonight Show</span></i><span>, claiming that AI could help people raise their kids. According to the rather fluffy </span><i><span>Variety</span></i><span> report, the deal makes Disney the “first major licensing partner on Sora,” which is OpenAI’s generative AI video platform. Users will be able to make videos featuring more than 200 characters across Disney, Marvel, Pixar, and </span><i><span>Star Wars, </span></i><span>and a variety of “costumes, props, vehicles, and iconic environments” that they can then share on social media.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>Importantly, the deal </span><span>does not</span><span> include “talent likenesses or voices,” so you won’t be seeing a mostly accurate Harrison Ford building a snowman with </span><i><span>Frozen</span></i><span>’s Elsa, or whatever weird digital amalgamation Disney adults decide to type into the slop machine. </span></p>

 <p><span>Characters people </span><i><span>can</span></i><span> use in their <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/ai-energy-demands-water-impact-internet-hyper-consumption-era/">quest to rob the planet of water</a> include:</span></p> <ul> <li aria-level="1"><span>Ariel from </span><i><span>The Little Mermaid</span></i></li> <li aria-level="1"><span>Belle from </span><i><span>Beauty and the Beast</span></i></li> <li aria-level="1"><span>Cinderella</span></li> <li aria-level="1"><span>Mickey Mouse</span></li> <li aria-level="1"><span>Minnie Mouse</span></li> <li aria-level="1"><span>Baymax from </span><i><span>Big Hero 6</span></i></li> <li aria-level="1"><span>Simba and Mufasa from </span><i><span>The Lion King</span></i><span>&nbsp;</span></li> <li aria-level="1"><span>Black Panther</span></li> <li aria-level="1"><span>Captain America</span></li> <li aria-level="1"><span>Deadpool</span></li> <li aria-level="1"><span>Groot</span></li> <li aria-level="1"><span>Iron Man</span></li> <li aria-level="1"><span>Thor</span></li> <li aria-level="1"><span>Thanos</span></li> </ul> <p><span>Importantly, the deal allows for “iconic animated or illustrated versions of Marvel and Lucasfilm characters,” so a cartoon version of Harrison Ford building a snowman with Elsa appears to be in the cards. </span></p>

 <p><span>It’s unclear what kinds of guardrails Disney (<a href="https://kotaku.com/disney-epic-fortnite-project-mickey-mouse-1851666530">notoriously protective over how its characters are used in media</a></span><span>) will put on Sora, which had to readjust back in October after users created videos of&nbsp;<a href="https://kotaku.com/sora-2-update-pokemon-nintendo-openai-sam-altman-ai-2000632089" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Altman grilling </a></span><a href="https://kotaku.com/sora-2-update-pokemon-nintendo-openai-sam-altman-ai-2000632089"><span>and eating Pikachu</span></a><span>. Considering that the depravity and stupidity of AI knows no bounds, I expect Disney will be regretting this deal sooner rather than later.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><span>The corporate conjunction also means Disney will be folding OpenAI into its daily operations, including “deploying ChatGPT for its employees.” It’s unclear if that means AI-generated content will be in the next </span><i><span>Moana</span></i><span> film. Disney is investing $1 billion into Altman’s AI company, so it clearly wants to get its money’s worth.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><span>Disney CEO Bob Iger rang the “AI is good” bell in an official statement, saying, “Technological innovation has continually shaped the evolution of entertainment, bringing with it new ways to create and share great stories with the world. The rapid advancement of artificial intelligence marks an important moment for our industry, and through this collaboration with OpenAI we will thoughtfully and responsibly extend the reach of our storytelling through generative AI, while respecting and protecting creators and their works.”</span></p> <p><span>Today, </span><a href="https://variety.com/2025/digital/news/disney-google-ai-copyright-infringement-cease-and-desist-letter-1236606429/"><span>Disney sent Google a cease-and-desist letter,</span></a><span> accusing the company of using AI to engage in copyright infringement on a “massive scale.” LOL. LMAO, even. </span></p>
