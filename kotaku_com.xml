              <p>During a recent appearance at a video game convention, <a href="https://kotaku.com/life-is-unfair-a-q-a-with-nier-automatas-director-1795653562"><em>NieR: Automata</em> creator Yoko Taro</a> addressed complaints and jokes from some fans online saying that the enigmatic creator hasn’t put out any big new games in years. According to Taro, it’s not from lack of trying, but instead due to frequent cancellations.</p> <p><a href="https://automaton-media.com/en/news/nier-automata-creator-yoko-taro-says-hes-actually-been-working-on-a-lot-of-projects-recently-its-just-that-they-got-cancelled-midway/">As reported by <em>Automaton Media</em></a> and <a href="https://www.4gamer.net/games/991/G999110/20251114049/"><em>4Gamer</em></a>, over the weekend in Korea, <a href="https://kotaku.com/yoko-taro-mask-nier-automata-emil-lost-anime-expo-2023-1850603039">Yoko Taro (who always wears a mask in public)</a> and <em>Bayonetta </em>director Hideki Kamiya took part in a panel discussion at G-CON 2025. The two game makers talked about game development, design, and their creative processes.&nbsp; At one point, the two game developers were asked to share some information on their latest game projects, and while Kamiya mentioned work was going well on the previously announced <em>Okami</em> sequel, Taro didn’t have much to share because his projects kept getting canceled.</p>

 <p>“I often get told stuff like ‘Why aren’t you making a new sequel to <a href="https://kotaku.com/nier-automata-the-kotaku-review-1793002839"><em>NieR</em></a>?’ or ‘Yoko Taro isn’t doing anything,’ but that’s because recently, a lot of projects I was involved in got discontinued midway through development,” said Taro.</p>

 <p>“I’ve actually been working on some stuff, it’s just that it never ended up seeing the light of day. I got paid for it, so I personally have no issues with that, but people seem to think that I haven’t been doing anything just because none of the work I’ve done is being released.”</p>

 <p>Taro wasn’t too sad about all the canned projects, though, explaining that he is staying optimistic and telling the convention-goers that he’d rather fail many times if it leads to making something good rather than releasing a bunch of not-so-great games.</p> <p>“I don’t view [the cancellations] as a negative thing,” explained Taro. “I believe that if I’m going to release something weird, I’d be better off not releasing anything at all.”</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/game-awards-2025-nominees-nominations-adaptation-sonic-3-2000644945</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><span>I know there’s no point in getting heated about </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/game-awards-2025-goty-nominees-categories-clair-obscur-2000644825"><span>the Game Awards</span></a><span> every year, but the 2025 nominations are really making this year’s event feel like it’s gonna be the </span><a href="https://theonion.com/taco-bells-five-ingredients-combined-in-totally-new-way-1819564909/"><span>Taco Bell of award ceremonies</span></a><span>. By that, I mean it feels like every category’s nominations are made up of the same five or so games. </span><i><span>Clair Obscur </span></i><span>and </span><i><span>Ghost of Yotei </span></i><span>were eating, but pretty much anything else got snubbed. But I’m not here to yell about games, actually. I’m here to call attention to one of the most egregious snubs of the show, which is found in a non-game category. Specifically, where the hell is </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/sonic-hedgehog-3-review-shadow-keanu-reeves-jim-carrey-1851726797"><i><span>Sonic the Hedgehog 3</span></i></a><span> in the Best Adaptation category?</span></p> <p><span>Best Adaptation was added to the Game Awards’ categories in 2022, rewarding TV and film adaptations of video games for finally getting off of the Uwe Boll assembly line and sometimes being things worth watching. Now that pretty much every company from Nintendo to Sony is trying to get into streaming services and multiplexes, it’s a worthwhile category to have at a video game award show. However, the 2025 Adaptation category is so vile in its inclusions and omissions that it’s enough to make a hedgehog vow to destroy the world for his dearly departed best friend.</span></p>

 <figure id="attachment_2000007812" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000007812"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000007812">© Paramount</figcaption></figure> <p><span>This year’s nominees range from forgettable to absolute dogshit. Here’s what we’re working with:</span><i></i></p> <ul> <li aria-level="1"><a href="https://kotaku.com/minecraft-movie-review-bad-jack-black-kids-movie-steve-1851775345"><i><span>A Minecraft Movie</span></i></a></li> </ul> <ul> <li aria-level="1"><a href="https://kotaku.com/devil-may-cry-netflix-review-season-1-dante-lady-vergil-1851774417"><i><span>Devil May Cry</span></i></a></li> </ul> <ul> <li aria-level="1"><a href="https://kotaku.com/splinter-cell-deathwatch-anime-netflix-2000619516"><i><span>Splinter Cell Deathwatch</span></i></a></li> </ul> <ul> <li aria-level="1"><a href="https://kotaku.com/last-of-us-season-2-hbo-max-show-review-joel-ellie-abby-1851774661"><i><span>The Last of Us</span></i><span>, Season Two</span></a></li> </ul> <ul> <li aria-level="1"><a href="https://kotaku.com/until-dawn-movie-trailer-rami-malek-wendingo-dr-hill-1851739047"><i><span>Until Dawn</span></i></a></li> </ul> <p><span>First of all, don’t even get me started on </span><i><span>The Last of Us </span></i><span>season two; you can read </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/last-of-us-season-2-episode-7-finale-recap-abby-jesse-1851782357"><span>literally thousands of words</span></a><span> I wrote on it earlier in the year. Meanwhile, </span><i><span>Sonic the Hedgehog 3</span></i><span>, the movie that currently holds the </span><a href="https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/sonic_the_hedgehog_3"><span>highest Rotten Tomatoes score of any video game adaptation</span></a><span>, is nowhere to be seen. There are a few reasons this probably happened. The cinematic adaptation of </span><i><span>Sonic Adventure 2 </span></i><span>came out last December, just late enough to miss the 2024 awards but still be eligible for the 2025 ceremony. That’s long enough for the jury to have forgotten that the movie could compete for the prize, and for stinkers like </span><i><span>Minecraft </span></i><span>and </span><i><span>The Last of Us </span></i><span>to be top of mind. This is an especially heinous oversight given the </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/knuckles-review-paramount-plus-episodes-season-one-1851423404"><span>Very Bad </span><i><span>Knuckles </span></i><span>Paramount+ show</span></a><span>, which sidelined the actual </span><i><span>Sonic </span></i><span>characters for the most obnoxious of its human originals, was nominated in 2024.</span></p> <p><span>Part of getting past the whole “putting stock in award shows” phase of your life is recognizing that they are often merely reflections of what the jury actually got around to. That’s likely why 2025’s nominees, rather than representing the breadth of the medium, wound up being so many of the same games over and over again. Some of the categories, such as Accessibility and Esports, are voted on by a jury of experts, while a lot of the rest are more generalized, which often keeps the more niche games, like </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/hundred-line-last-defense-academy-steam-switch-reviews-1851781786"><span>the IMO obvious GOTY contender </span><i><span>The Hundred Line: Last Defense Academy</span></i></a><span>,</span> <span>from getting the nods they deserve. And sometimes you just get weird oversights, like </span><i><span>Sonic the Hedgehog 3</span></i><span> missing out on a nomination for Best Adaptation, while Jack Black saying “Chicken jockey!” gets to cosplay as a good film for a night. God, </span><i><span>The Last of Us </span></i><span>season two is going to win, isn’t it? I gotta lie down. Keanu Reeves didn’t deserve this.</span></p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/escape-from-tarkov-steam-1-0-unheard-edition-2000644941</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/escape-from-tarkov-is-finally-on-steam-and-nobody%E2%80%99s-happy.1356244/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><i>Escape from Tarkov</i>’s efforts to move on from its early access period and become a full release have not gone smoothly. Steam users lament a variety of concerns with the new 1.0 release, from gripes over the pricing of different versions to complaints that just launching the game is a laborious and frustrating process.</p> <p>On November 15, hardcore extraction shooter <i>Escape from Tarkov</i> saw two notable events occur. Firstly, it emerged from a beta status, which it was in for over eight years, into the full, official 1.0 release. And secondly, it arrived on Steam. Unfortunately, as the game’s director <a href="https://www.pcgamesn.com/escape-from-tarkov/steam-launch-user-reviews">Nikita Buyanov seems to have anticipated</a>, user reviews on the platform have met the game with scorn, dragging the overall rating into “Mixed” status for its English reviews.</p>

 <p>“[It’s] one of the most premium pieces of launcher software I have ever purchased,” <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198157204571/recommended/3932890/">reads one</a> of the top “Most Helpful” negative reviews on Steam. “Great hardcore experience, it already starts with trying to launch the game – 10/10” reads <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198035754009/recommended/3932890/">a cleverly disguised “positive” review</a> in the same category. That critique doesn’t seem to be an overreaction either, as several other reviews cite an <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/id/snoygg/recommended/3932890/">hours-long struggle</a> just to get into the game.</p>

 <p>These launch issues follow recent turmoil within the game’s community over the fact that the Steam version would <a href="https://kotaku.com/escape-from-tarkov-1-0-arena-steam-epic-unheard-edition-2000626063">require a separate purchase</a> for those who already owned the game. And <i>that </i>controversy came fresh after developer Battlestate Games faced tough criticism over <a href="https://kotaku.com/escape-from-tarkov-refund-voucher-1851490315">a controversial $250 version of the game</a>. Like your average game of <i>EFT</i>, it’s messy.</p> <p><i>Tarkov</i>’s tough-as-nails gameplay will probably always appeal to a select and discriminating group of shooter aficionados. Still, this poor reception arrives with some unfortunate timing as the extraction shooter genre has seemingly never been more popular; <i>Arc Raiders</i>’ persistent status in the <a href="https://steamdb.info/charts/">top three most-played games</a> on Steam and the wide appeal of <a href="https://kotaku.com/theres-a-damned-good-reason-escape-from-duckov-has-sold-a-million-copies-in-a-week-2000638588"><i>Escape from Duckov</i></a> speak to a rise in popularity, one in which genre pioneer <i>EFT</i> feels notably left out of the conversation.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[New Survey Says Most Players Around The World Prefer Single-Player Games]]></title>
            <link>https://kotaku.com/new-survey-most-players-around-world-prefer-singleplayer-games-solo-2000644895</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/new-survey-says-most-players-around-the-world-prefer-single-player-games.1356211/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Data from a new global survey involving over 30,000 gamers spread across 20+ markets shows that, overall, people who play games prefer single-player over multiplayer. However, digging into the data reveals some interesting differences between countries like Germany and China, as well as how age plays a factor.</p> <p>On November 17, Ampere Analysis published the results of a large-scale video game survey focusing on <a href="https://kotaku.com/look-single-player-people-are-just-better-5826946">single-player vs. multiplayer games</a>. The research and marketing firm asked 34,428 people who have played a video game in the last year if they agreed with this statement: “I prefer single-player games over multiplayer games.” And the newly released data shows that gamers in most countries do.</p>

 <figure id="attachment_2000644930" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000644930"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000644930">©Ampere Analysis</figcaption></figure> <p>In the United States, Ampere’s data revealed that 65 percent of gamers prefer single-player, making it the country with the highest number of solo-leaning players. Right behind the United States is Japan at 63 percent, Thailand at 62 percent, and Germany at 60 percent. Meanwhile, a slightly lower number of United Kingdom gamers, 58 percent, prefer single-player over online gaming.</p>

 <p>Interestingly, China and Sweden are the two countries that don’t prefer single-player, according to this survey. 47 percent of players in China and 49 percent in Sweden prefer single-player, meaning more than half would rather log on and play with friends or randos.</p>

 <h2>Multiplayer is more popular with younger gamers</h2> <p>Digging into the data more, Ampere says that gender didn’t play much of a factor, with 55 percent of men and women preferring single-player over multiplayer. On the other hand, age did play a major factor in the survey.</p> <p>According to the firm’s data, only 49 percent of 16-to 24-year-olds prefer playing by themselves. Preference for single-player adventures jumps up to 56 percent when you reach the 25-to-34-year-old range. Meanwhile, 64 percent of gamers aged 55 or older prefer single-player titles.</p>

 <p>This isn’t very shocking to hear, as free games like <a href="https://kotaku.com/old-games-2023-playtime-data-fortnite-roblox-minecraft-1851382474"><em>Roblox </em>and <em>Fortnite</em> have become extremely popular</a> with <a href="https://kotaku.com/pc-gaming-newzoo-balatro-helldivers-2-gdc-time-spent-1851771352">kids and teens who might not be able to afford playing $70+ single-player games</a>. They also likely have more free time to coordinate online sessions with pals, whereas anyone over the age of 30 will be able to share stories of how damn hard it is to get a few friends online to play anything.</p> <p>One thing to keep in mind: Just because this survey and <a href="https://kotaku.com/survey-data-study-53-percent-gamers-singleplayer-pvp-1851665722">others show that a lot of gamers want single-player games</a>, that doesn’t mean publishers are going to stop making live-service titles. The reality is that publishers want to nickel and dime people with one game rather than make a few very expensive single-player adventures that could flop and can’t support years of seasonal updates and battle passes.</p>

              <p><i><span>Overwatch 2</span></i><span>’s story missions <a href="https://kotaku.com/overwatch-2-story-missions-campaign-canceled-blizzard-1851345720">never arrived</a>, but the original had a few <a href="https://kotaku.com/overwatch-2-story-pve-canceled-campaign-null-sector-2000641177">cooperative missions</a> that further explored the hero shooter’s world and heroes. One of these was called </span><i><span><a href="https://kotaku.com/overwatchs-new-pve-event-is-its-best-yet-1825183663">Retribution</a>,</span></i><span> and it starred Reaper, Cassidy, Genji, and Moira as members of Blackwatch, Overwatch’s covert operatives arm. At the beginning of the mission, Reaper kills a man named Antonio Bartalotti, a criminal and member of the chaos-seeding Talon organization. This assassination sets up the mission players fight through, as well as the eventual downfall of the Overwatch organization, but as we learned today, over seven years later, it was also a canon event for </span><i><span>Overwatch 2</span></i><span>’s next hero, Vendetta.</span></p>  <p><span>Blizzard has released a new animated trailer titled La Lupa which shows Vendetta, a new, sword-wielding hero, fighting a massive Omnic in Colosseo to the tune of hundreds of less-than-adoring fans. In her voiceover, she’s talking to her Papa who taught her how to outsmart her opponents, whether that be in Chess or in a coliseum. Then the trailer reveals that her father was none other than Antonio. So now, after all those years, Vendetta has…a vendetta against the members of Blackwatch. That organization is defunct, though, so I guess she’s taking out all her frustrations on robots in the coliseum.</span></p> <p><span>We don’t see any gameplay of Vendetta in action, but she does seem to be one of the rare melee heroes in </span><i><span>Overwatch</span></i><span>’s roster. She’s built like a tank, so she might fall into that role, but we’ll know for sure soon since Blizzard is holding a trial run for the character from November 6 to December 1. Vendetta will officially join the roster in Season 20 on December 9.</span></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><span>The CEO of the studio behind </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/helldivers-2-kotaku-review-pc-ps5-is-it-good-ps-plus-1851258251"><i><span>Helldivers 2</span></i></a><span>, the wildly successful third-person shooter that recently came to Xbox, weighed in on the video game industry’s increasing use of AI and how he believes it “actually makes gaming better.”</span></p> <p><span>As reported by </span><a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/third-person-shooter/helldivers-2-boss-argues-arc-raiders-ai-use-actually-makes-gaming-better-and-that-people-jump-to-extreme-takes-about-the-tech-surely-theres-a-middle-ground-here/"><i><span>GamesRadar</span></i></a><span>, Arrowhead Game Studios CEO Shams Jorjani was on an episode of </span><a href="https://youtu.be/AyVTlQR__ZU?si=JJHjmoQPGIj-Fb5v&amp;t=1561"><span>The Game Business Show</span></a><span> when the conversation shifted to the use of AI in game development. The host, Christopher Dring, brought up the “industry moment” around </span><i><span>Arc Raiders</span></i><span>, the recently released extraction shooter that’s been a breakout hit for developer Embark Studios, and the center of a conversation around using AI in game development.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>For Jorjani, opinions on the controversial topic are too black and white. “Maybe, could it be, that reality is somewhere in the middle? Could it be?” he asked. He believes that, rather than developers using AI to “remove the stuff we don’t want to do,” people jump to “let’s never actually use AI, all AI is bad AI.”</span></p>

 <p><span>“We don’t put any AI in the games,” Jorjani says. “But if it can allow me to do my receipts faster, that’s more </span><i><span>Helldivers</span></i><span> for everyone.”</span></p> <p><span>It was </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/arc-raiders-gen-ai-nexon-eurogamer-voices-2000643436"><span>recently revealed that Embark hired voice actors for </span><i><span>Arc Raiders</span></i></a><span>, then used AI to flesh out in-game voice lines rather than having “someone come in every time we create a new line for the game,” according to an </span><a href="https://www.pcgamesn.com/arc-raiders/generative-ai-use"><span>interview with </span><i><span>PCGamesN</span></i></a><span>. This sparked a heated debate about the use of AI in game development and even negatively </span><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/arc-raiders-review"><span>affected </span><i><span>Eurogamer</span></i><span>’s review of the game</span></a><span> (which awarded it two out of five stars).&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><span>“I find that people jump to extreme takes,” Jorjani says of the response to </span><i><span>Arc Raiders</span></i><span>’ AI use. “I think it’s a very interesting use case that actually makes gaming better.”</span></p> <h2><b>The AI game development controversy continues</b></h2> <p><span>But as Dring brings up during the interview, Square Enix recently revealed it wants to eventually have 70 percent of its quality assurance work done by AI. QA work often serves as an entry-level role in game development, and this could be a huge hit to the industry’s workforce, which is one of the main points of contention people have with implementing AI.</span></p>

 <p><span>Junghun Lee, the CEO of Nexton Co. Ltd (which published </span><i><span>Arc Raiders</span></i><span>), said in a </span><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/arc-raiders-sparks-debate-over-ai-voice-acting-in-games/1100-6536146/"><span>November 12 interview</span></a><span> with </span><a href="https://www.gamespark.jp/article/2025/11/10/159294.html"><span>Japanese gaming site </span><i><span>Gamespark</span></i></a> <span>that “</span><span>it’s important to assume that every game company is now using AI.” But with the video game industry plagued with layoffs and studio closures, what does that mean for the future of its workforce?</span></p>

 <p><span>The ideological split is only widening. Brendan Green, the creator of the wildly successful battle royale </span><i><span>PUBG</span></i><span>, told </span><i><span>Eurogamer</span></i><span> he was “really heartened to see the community revolt against AI stuff.” </span><i><span>PUBG</span></i><span> is published by South Korean company Krafton, which </span><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/after-south-korean-publisher-krafton-announced-its-transforming-into-an-ai-first-company-its-now-offering-employees-voluntary-resignation"><span>recently announced a massive “AI-first” mandate</span></a><span> for the entire company while also announcing the option for employees to voluntarily resign if they felt they were not in line with its “direction of change.”</span></p>

 <p><span>Elsewhere, </span><i><span>Call of Duty: Black Ops 7 </span></i><span>publisher Activision </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-ai-art-activision-statement-blops7-steam-ps5-2000644397"><span>recently came under fire for using AI-generated content</span></a><span> for some of its artwork. “Like so many around the world, we use a variety of digital tools, including AI tools, to empower and support our teams to create the best gaming experiences possible for our players. Our creative process continues to be led by the talented individuals in our studios,” Activision told</span><i><span> Kotaku</span></i><span> on November 14.</span></p> <p><span>AI in game development seems to be here to stay, but just how it will be utilized going forward, and how developers, voice actors, and players will feel about it, remains to be seen.</span></p>

              <p>Less than a decade after the original animated <em>Moana</em> hit theaters, Disney has released the first real trailer for its upcoming live-action remake, and folks, it doesn’t look great.</p> <p>On November 17, Disney released the first official teaser trailer for its live-action remake of <em>Moana</em>. Starring Catherine Lagaʻaia as the titular Moana and Dwayne Johnson reprising his role as demigod Maui, the remake appears to be a nearly shot-for-shot recreation of the original 2016 animated movie. Here’s the trailer:</p>  <p>I know this isn’t an original complaint, but it continues to be wild how many of <a href="https://kotaku.com/disney-lion-king-the-little-mermaid-cinderella-1851767126">these live-action Disney remakes</a> barely look like live-action films at all. <em>Moana</em> might not be completely CG like the “live-action” <em>Lion King</em> remake, but boy howdy does a lot of this movie look like an Unreal Engine fan-game based on the original movie and not a film starring real people in real places. And when we do see real people, they almost look out of place.</p>

 <p>One scene in particular, involving Maui jumping off a cliff, looks so artificial and crappy that if you showed that to me without any context and said it was created by some AI tool, I’d probably believe you. And while some shots, like the one involving a whale and some boats, look better, I’m still not convinced this won’t be a mess. And making the chicken fully CG is boring and strange. Give me a real chicken, damn it!</p> <p>It was around this time last year that <a href="https://kotaku.com/snow-white-seven-dwarfs-trailer-cgi-ugly-bad-disney-1851712570">Disney fully revealed the <em>Snow White</em> remake and its horrific-looking dwarves.</a> That movie ended up being <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_most_expensive_films#:~:text=nb%201%5D-,22,%5B22%5D,-23">a very expensive flop</a> for the Mickey Mouse company, <a href="https://kotaku.com/tangled-remake-canceled-paused-snow-white-disney-flop-1851774677">reportedly leading to at least one live-action film being shelved</a>. However, this year’s <em>Lilo &amp; Stitch</em> remake was <a href="https://kotaku.com/lilo-stitch-remake-live-action-box-office-record-mi8-1851782470?_gl=1*8vfk2q*_ga*MTc0MjY2NTg1OS4xNzQwMzc1OTc4*_ga_V4QNJTT5L0*czE3NTA5NDQ3NTYkbzE1MCRnMSR0MTc1MDk1NTM2NiRqMTQkbDAkaDA.">a massive hit</a> for Disney, so I don’t expect the company to stop plundering its treasure trove of famous animated movies and <a href="https://kotaku.com/lilo-and-stitch-2-sequel-announced-teaser-disney-626-1851785144">turning them into live-action slop anytime soon</a>.&nbsp;We’ll see how well this new version of <em>Moana</em> does at the box office when it arrives in theaters on July 10, 2026.</p>
