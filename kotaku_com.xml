            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/arc-raiders-review-extraction-loot-shooter-embark-2000642198"><i>Arc Raiders</i></a> is dense. That happens to be part of why I love it so much. But there’s no way around it: There’s a lot of stuff to keep track of in this game, from craftable materials, to weapon mods, to the weapons themselves, not to mention quick use items and your augments and shields. It feels endless sometimes–especially given that we so often interface with them one item at a time while we pick ‘em outta random bins or lockers we’ve broken into, or scavenge them from the innards of mechanical menaces we’ve shot down (or biological ones).</p> <p>That’s where cheat sheets and other resources come in. <i>Arc Raiders</i> has been out for a couple of weeks and already there are a bunch of fantastic user-made tools out there.</p> <p>Whether your preference is for images, spreadsheets, or websites, I’ve tracked down a few impressive and wildly useful resources to help you break down the game. Some of these address very specific parts of the sandbox of <i>Arc Raiders</i>’ toys, while others are more comprehensive. Let’s take a look.</p>

 <h2><i>Arc Raiders </i>Database: The GOAT</h2> <p>Let’s kick things off with what I think is currently the best third-party resource for looking up info and tracking your progress as you collect your way to supremacy. Enter <a href="https://ardb.tools/"><i>Arc Raiders</i> Database</a>. Ardb.tools really is a one-stop shop for details on just about any item, map, and even enemy you’d need information about. Looking for a specific resource? Each item gets its own page, complete with all the info you need including locations on each map where you might be likely to find it. You can also directly compare the stats of guns and their various upgrade tiers. It rocks.</p>

 <p>There’s not much else I can say about it other than to encourage you to head on over and start clicking around. The tricky thing with these websites is that they’re only as good as their information is relevant, and as a live-service game, <i>Arc Raiders</i> is a moving target for these kinds of projects. But for now at least,</p>

 <p>this is perhaps the most comprehensive and thorough third-party resource for <i>Arc Raiders</i> thus far, and I also think its UI is very well done. Bookmark it; let it live on a second screen, or use it on your smartphone.</p> <h2>A more comprehensive weapon breakdown</h2> <p>As I said in <a href="https://kotaku.com/arc-raiders-guns-blue-green-purple-gold-best-2000644142">my weapons overview</a>, <i>Arc Raiders</i> is a tricky game to figure out metas for. There are so many ways to enter and leave a match, and so many ways to get into or out of trouble, that simple DPS or TTK stats only give you one part of the picture of an <i>Arc Raiders</i> gun battle.</p>

 <p>But if you want a deep dive, all the way down to headshot multipliers and how many shots it takes to kill someone, have a gander at <a href="https://onedrive.live.com/personal/4c1e78b900b3bf5d/_layouts/15/Doc.aspx?sourcedoc=%7B9253d3f8-679e-4b41-90be-f4f0e67f74f8%7D&amp;action=default&amp;redeem=aHR0cHM6Ly8xZHJ2Lm1zL3gvYy80YzFlNzhiOTAwYjNiZjVkL0VmalRVNUtlWjBGTGtMNzA4T1pfZFBnQmtXbXRMNW52dS1NLUZvdllUdTRIWFE_ZT1zeVR6WGU&amp;slrid=f660d9a1-f07e-0000-17be-eeccdf68937c&amp;originalPath=aHR0cHM6Ly8xZHJ2Lm1zL3gvYy80YzFlNzhiOTAwYjNiZjVkL0lRRDQwMU9Tbm1kQlM1Qy05UERtZjNUNEFaRnByUy1aNzd2alBoYUwyRTd1QjEwP3J0aW1lPWNQemV1YlVqM2tn&amp;CID=e5a5ee82-eb40-4380-a467-656d8059d225&amp;_SRM=0:G:39">the Anvil Community’s Weapon Metrics spreadsheet</a>.</p> <p>As an .xlsx, you can even download the <a href="http://spreadsheet.it/">spreadsheet</a>. Clearly, it will work better in Excel or Microsoft’s live office tools. I’ve been able to download it and add it to my Google Drive, and it seems to work alright. The tabs on the bottom of the page refer to shield strength, so it will recalculate TTKs based on what your target is potentially wearing.</p>

 <p>This information might be wildly subject to change given <i>Arc Raiders</i>’ live-service nature, but for now, it’s one of the only ways to drill down to specifics such as headshot multiplayers and specific numbers of shots-to-kill.</p> <h2>Just the crafting resources</h2> <p>Two resources stood out to me when considering a cheat sheet focused entirely on resources (in addition to the excellent PDF/PNG cheat sheet I shouted out in <a href="https://kotaku.com/arc-raiders-inventory-full-stash-loadout-crafting-cheat-sheet-2000643629">my inventory management guide</a>).</p>

 <p>First up is the humbly named “<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ArcRaiders/comments/1owy9dm/scrap_spreadsheet/">Scrap” Google spreadsheet</a>, created <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ArcRaiders/comments/1owy9dm/scrap_spreadsheet/">by Redditor s1munsayz</a>. This is a very simple spreadsheet laying out all of the crafting resources you can recover, with a simple layout of what they can be recycled/salvaged into. Resources like ARDB are amazing, but a straightforward spreadsheet is sometimes a better visual learning aid.</p> <p>Be sure to make your own copy in your Google Drive to use its search functions appropriately.</p> <p>I also want to shout out <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ArcRaiders/comments/1otpx0o/inventory_manager_manage_your_inventory_easier/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button">Redditor Legal_Squash_195’s</a> “Inventory Manager,” a standalone Python app you can <a href="https://github.com/dev-boog/Arc-Raiders-Inventory-Manager">download from Github</a>. You’ll need to have Python installed on your machine to get it to work, but it’s a handy app–and if you’re like me and enjoy a good standalone, community-created piece of software, Inventory Manager is pretty awesome.</p>

 <h2>Honorable mention: arcraiders.wiki</h2> <p>While I think ARDB takes the cake with its vast amount of options, <a href="https://arcraiders.wiki/">arcraiders.wiki</a> was an early resource for me and it remains a solid way to sort through and look up the nature of various crafting materials, weapons, enemies, and maps.</p> <hr> <p>Time will tell how useful these resources remain over time, especially as <i>Arc Raiders</i> continues to get updates and potential changes to its meta math under the hood. For now, bookmark, download, do whatever you need to, because having these resources at the ready dramatically improves the overall flow of a healthy session of <i>Arc Raiders</i>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p data-component="paragraph">In 2017, some former Telltale developers were working on a <em>Splinter Cell</em> sequel that eventually, due to Ubisoft’s focus on live-service games, morphed into the now-dead free-to-play FPS<em> XDefiant.</em></p> <p data-component="paragraph"><a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2025-11-14/the-turbulent-seven-year-saga-behind-hit-game-dispatch?accessToken=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJzb3VyY2UiOiJTdWJzY3JpYmVyR2lmdGVkQXJ0aWNsZSIsImlhdCI6MTc2MzE0MzM2NiwiZXhwIjoxNzYzNzQ4MTY2LCJhcnRpY2xlSWQiOiJUNVFBMDdHUEZIUlYwMCIsImJjb25uZWN0SWQiOiJCMUVBQkI5NjQ2QUM0REZFQTJBRkI4MjI1MzgyQTJFQSJ9.fNOncm0D1BfbWI9RAgwCB6j8SI8mW9RhRD76EEz1TYo&amp;leadSource=uverify%20wall">In a <em>Bloomberg</em> story published on November 14</a> about the development of the recently released narrative-focused superhero adventure game <em>Dispatch</em>, we learn a little bit about a previously unknown-to-the-public <em>Splinter Cell</em> game that was being developed by Ubisoft San Francisco around eight years ago.</p> <p data-component="paragraph">Adhoc Co-Founder Nick Herman told <em>Bloomberg</em> that in early 2017, he and a few colleagues left Telltale after working on <em>Tales from the Borderlands</em> and landed at Ubisoft San Francisco. They were tasked with developing a new entry in the tactical stealth franchise, <em>Splinter Cell.</em> At that point, it had been about four years since the last game, <a href="https://kotaku.com/splinter-cell-blacklist-the-kotaku-review-1126859452"><em>Blacklist</em>, had been released in 2013</a>.</p>

 <p data-component="paragraph">“I was so excited to be a part of this and help revitalize it, because it’s been dormant for a while,” Herman told the outlet. “And we thought we could tell a great story and do something the fans would love.”</p> <p data-component="paragraph">However, after working on the new <em>Splinter Cell</em> sequel for a few months, Ubisoft executives started disrupting development. This was when the publisher was becoming more and more focused on live-service games that could be updated for years and years, like <em>Rainbow Six Siege </em>and <em>The Division 2. </em>Ubisoft reportedly wanted all of its in-development games to include live-service elements and monetization, including the new <em>Splinter Cell.&nbsp;</em></p>

 <p data-component="paragraph">“We tried,” Herman told <em>Bloomberg</em>. “Let’s make a narrative [live-service] game. We were trying to make that make sense, and a lot of cool prototypes were made.” But it apparently became clear to those working on the doomed game that Ubisoft was no longer interested in <em>Splinter Cell.&nbsp;</em>According to<em> Bloomberg</em> and Herman, the project changed and evolved many times, and eventually became <a href="https://kotaku.com/ubisoft-xdefiant-shut-down-ending-call-of-duty-cod-june-1851712899"><em>XDefiant,</em> aka that short-lived live-service shooter Ubisoft killed back in June.&nbsp;</a></p> <p>“It was exciting to go to work for the first six months because we thought we were going to be able to make something really great,” Herman said. “And then you realize that all of the things you care about, they don’t anymore. It’s a common thing in games.”</p> <p>Ubisoft hasn’t completely given up on <em>Splinter Cell. </em><a href="https://kotaku.com/new-splinter-cell-trailer-netflix-deathwatch-chaos-theory-ending-john-wick-2000626077">There’s an animated series that recently arrived on Netflix</a> that I’m guessing you didn’t know about. And <a href="https://news.ubisoft.com/en-us/article/4adJLuhgYrPboHAPRfK7Oz/splinter-cell-remake-begins-development-at-ubisoft-toronto">in 2021, the company confirmed Ubisoft Toronto was developing a remake</a> of the first game. We’ve not heard much about that project since it was first revealed. Hopefully, it doesn’t morph into some <em>Call of Duty</em> clone.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Activision Responds To Call Of Duty: Black Ops 7‘s AI-Generated Artwork]]></title>
            <link>https://kotaku.com/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-ai-art-activision-statement-blops7-steam-ps5-2000644397</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/activision-responds-to-call-of-duty-black-ops-7%E2%80%98s-ai-generated-artwork.1354138/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Stop me if you’ve heard this one before: The latest <em>Call of Duty</em> game seems to contain AI-generated art that doesn’t look very good, and people aren’t happy about it. This time, it’s the newly released <a href="https://kotaku.com/cod-blops-7-campaign-coop-always-online-pause-co-op-xp-challenges-2000644358"><em>Black Ops 7.</em></a></p> <p>On November 14, <em>Call of Duty: Black Ops 7</em> launched across consoles and PC. And within a few hours, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/CODBlackOps7/comments/1owqr38/so_these_calling_cards_are_definitely_ai/">players online were sharing screenshots of artwork</a> within the game that they believe is AI-generated slop. And it’s hard not to agree.</p> <p><a href="https://x.com/Kumesicles/status/1988984517823197541">Looking at some of this artwork</a>, including in-game player banners, I notice the telltale signs of AI imagery, including at least one cartoon character that appears to have <a href="https://x.com/Kumesicles/status/1989327996126126344">six fingers</a>. Eyelines also don’t match up, and some objects seem vaguely defined. And almost all of it just looks really bland. Keep in mind, these are rewards you get for completing challenges, which makes it even more depressing; gee, thanks, some machine-vomited “art.”</p>

 <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">Almost every single campaign and endgame calling card in bo7 is like Grok Ai generated images its so insane <a href="https://t.co/5bCGNJQmgn">pic.twitter.com/5bCGNJQmgn</a></p> <p>— Kume (@Kumesicles) <a href="https://twitter.com/Kumesicles/status/1988984517823197541?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 13, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <p>Other players have shared screenshots of what looks like AI-generated artwork within<em> Black Ops 7’s</em> campaign, which this year is online-only and designed around multiplayer. Of course, we can’t know for sure which pieces of art in the latest<em> Call of Duty</em> were created by humans, which were generated by a machine, and which are a combo, with humans touching up crappy generated imagery.</p>

 <p>But we do know for a fact that <em>Black Ops 7</em> has AI art in it, as confirmed by the game’s Steam store page: “Our team uses generative AI tools to help develop some in-game assets.” This is the same disclaimer found on <a href="https://kotaku.com/black-ops-6-ai-calling-card-loading-screen-blops-6-cod-1851766313"><em>Black Ops 6′</em>s store page, which was added in February</a>.</p>

 <p><em>Kotaku</em> contacted Activision about the AI art in <em>Black Ops 7 </em>and was sent this statement:</p> <blockquote><p>“Like so many around the world, we use a variety of digital tools, including AI tools, to empower and support our teams to create the best gaming experiences possible for our players. Our creative process continues to be led by the talented individuals in our studios.”</p></blockquote> <h2><em>Black Ops 7</em> and <em>Black Ops 6</em> both use AI art</h2> <p>If that sounds familiar, it’s because this is similar to what Activision and Treyarch said about <em>Black Ops 6</em> earlier this year, following months of players accusing the devs of using AI slop. In an interview with <em>IGN</em> in August, <a href="https://kotaku.com/black-ops-7-generative-ai-call-duty-gamescom-2025-slop-2000618833">Treyarch associate creative director Miles Leslie talked about using AI art</a> in <em>Black Ops 7.</em></p>

 <p>The developer claimed that “everything that goes into the game is touched by the team a hundred percent,” but did admit that AI tools are used to “help.” As to why some clearly AI-generated art that was seemingly not fixed up by a human slipped into <em>Black Ops 6,</em> Leslie told <em>IGN</em> it was an “accident.”</p> <p data-cy="paragraph">“That was never the intention,” said Leslie. “We’ve come out and been very clear that we use these as tools to help the team, but they do not replace any of the fantastic team members we have that are doing the final touches and building that content to put it in the game. So everything you play: human-created and touched. AI tools in the world we live in: it’s how do we streamline it? That’s really the goal. Not replace, but streamline.”</p> <p data-cy="paragraph">And with players discovering bland AI-generated images in <em>Call of Duty: Black Ops 7</em> and Activision openly confirming it and embracing it, it seems this is&nbsp;just how it works now, I guess.</p>
