            <title><![CDATA[The Coolest Thing About Deadpool In Marvel Rivals Isn’t The Role Swapping]]></title>

              <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/marvel-rivals-deadpool-daredevil-leak-audio-voice-lines-overwatch-2-lady-gaga-2000620344"><span>Deadpool</span></a><span> is coming to </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/marvel-rivals-review-hero-shooter-overwatch-netease-1851717975"><i><span>Marvel Rivals</span></i></a><span>, and it’s fitting that the Merc with a Mouth would pretty much break every rule the hero shooter has established in its first year. He’s a flex character that is capable of swapping between the tank, damage, and support roles throughout a match, and he already looks like a pretty busted version of all three based on the first gameplay trailer. But one of the cool, less-talked-about aspects of </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/deadpool-vr-is-a-game-for-deadpool-fans-and-nobody-else-2000645514"><span>Deadpool’s</span></a><span> kit is how it implements his status as a fourth-wall-breaking troublemaker into his ability set.</span></p>  <p><span>With all of his erratic movements and all the comic-book-style frames and other details that frequently pop up around him, </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/x-men-movies-best-worst-ranked-deadpool-logan-wolverine-1851595435"><span>Deadpool’s</span></a><span> moveset is one of the harder ones to read in the </span><i><span>Marvel Rivals</span></i><span> roster. I’m sure once we actually get to play as the character, we’ll all get more familiar with his arsenal of tools and develop a sense of what he’s capable of. But for now, one of the things that stands out to me is how NetEase implemented the meta element of the character into how he fights.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><span>Throughout a match, Deadpool will level up with buffs depending on his role, and you access these by opening up a </span><i><span>Marvel Rivals </span></i><span>comic book that Deadpool will flip through as you choose your upgrades. He also has abilities that break the fourth wall, such as one that shows a mini streamer portrait of the hero on an opponent’s screen that smacks them around with a hammer. Not sure how you avoid that or if it’s a sort of “status effect” with a set duration, but it’s appropriately obnoxious for Wade Wilson’s kit to have comic-book pop-ups and winks to the camera.</span></p>

 <p><span>Deadpool is joining the </span><i><span>Marvel Rivals </span></i><span>roster in season 6, which begins on January 16.</span></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><span>Rockstar Games has just launched the Cfx Marketplace, described as “a curated digital storefront” which will allow a select group of creators “to share and sell” mods for both </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/grand-theft-auto-5-gta-6-mod-ai-npc-legal-youtube-1850749678"><i><span>Grand Theft Auto V</span></i></a><span> and </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/red-dead-redemption-2-mod-video-npc-memories-blurbs-2000631070"><i><span>Red Dead Redemption II</span></i></a><span>.</span><span><br> </span><span><br> </span><span>Rockstar Games, and by extension its parent company Take-Two Interactive, has a harsh and often litigious relationship with its modding community. Although the developer has never truly been supportive of modding efforts for its games, Rockstar’s laser-focused approach to issuing </span><i><span>GTA</span></i><span>-related takedown notices took root in 2019, following a string of DMCA takedowns for mods on both ModDB and GTA5-Mods.</span><span><br> </span><span><br> </span><span>As a user on the </span><a href="https://gtaforums.com/topic/974338-take-two-vs-the-gta-modding-community-2021-ee-edition/#comments"><span>GTA Forums explained</span></a><span>, this new wave of takedown notices was attributed to a change in Rockstar Games’ user agreement in 2019 that banned modding, while the previous 2017 agreement had no such provision. (That previous user agreement has since been “excluded from the wayback machine” and therefore can no longer be found online.)</span></p> <figure id="attachment_2000659827" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000659827"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000659827">Rockstar Games / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p><span><br> </span><span>Since then, Take-Two’s legal team has been ruthless in their legal pursuits against a string of </span><i><span>Grand Theft Auto </span></i><span>mods. In 2025 alone, the mod teams behind </span><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/gta-5-liberty-city-preservation-project-shut-down/"><span>Liberty City Preservation Project</span></a><span> (a mod which transplanted </span><i><span>GTA IV’s</span></i><span> map into </span><i><span>GTA V</span></i><span>), a </span><a href="https://www.tomshardware.com/video-games/browser-run-copy-of-grand-theft-auto-gets-taken-down-by-dcma-take-two-says-dos-zone-infringed-companys-intellectual-property-rights-despite-disclaimers-and-requirement-to-own-original-copy-of-title-to-run-full-game-online"><span>web browser port</span></a><span> of </span><i><span>GTA: Vice City</span></i><span>, and </span><a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/playable-gta-6-map-mod-project-vice-is-no-more-following-take-two-copyright-strike"><span>Project Vice</span></a><span> (which modded </span><i><span>Grand Theft Auto VI’s</span></i><span> leaked map data into </span><i><span>GTA V</span></i><span>) were all issued DMCA takedown notices by Take-Two Interactive.</span><span><br> </span><span><br> </span><span>However, in spite of all this, Rockstar Games announced an exception to their “policy on mods” in 2022, following the ever-growing popularity of Cfx.re’s </span><i><span>Grand Theft Auto V</span></i><span> and </span><i><span>Red Dead Redemption II</span></i><span> roleplay servers FiveM and RedM. Then, in 2023, Rockstar Games revealed </span><a href="https://www.rockstargames.com/newswire/article/8971o8789584a4/roleplay-community-update"><span>that Cfx.re was</span></a><span> “now officially a part of Rockstar Games.”</span><span><br> </span><span><br> </span><span>Funnily enough, in 2015, Rockstar Games banned the Rockstar Social Club accounts of several of the members behind FiveM. Rockstar Games then </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/rockstar-allegedly-bans-modders-for-making-alternative-1723093679"><span>issued an official statement</span></a><span> which explained that the FiveM project “is an unauthorized alternate multiplayer service that contains code designed to facilitate piracy.”</span></p>

 <h2>The <em>GTA</em>&nbsp;mods will be monetized</h2> <p><a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/rockstar-launches-official-marketplace-for-mods"><span>Earlier this week</span></a><span> on January 12, Cfx announced the </span><a href="https://forum.cfx.re/t/introducing-the-cfx-marketplace/5369289"><span>Cfx Marketplace</span></a><span>, which they described as “a curated digital storefront where talented FiveM/RedM creators can share and sell their work.” Although the marketplace is clearly aimed at </span><i><span>GTA V</span></i><span> and </span><i><span>RDR II</span></i><span> server owners, the official news post states that “there’s something for every server and every player,” including “purchasable props, scripts, maps, and much more.”</span><span><br> </span><span><br> </span><span>The marketplace features a handful of mods that are free to download, as well as mods that require a </span><a href="https://marketplace.cfx.re/packages/6187491-onx-eup-police-ems-clothing-pack"><span>$23.99 recurring monthly fee</span></a><span> and bundles that cost </span><a href="https://marketplace.cfx.re/packages/6187491-onx-eup-police-ems-clothing-pack"><span>upwards of $467.99</span></a><span>. For the time being, Cfx has only partnered with a “select group” of modders for its initial launch. It’s also not clear exactly how much of a cut Take-Two Interactive is getting from these purchases.</span><span><br> </span><span><br> </span><span>It could be argued that the creation of the Cfx Marketplace is Rockstar Games’ attempt at providing a space for server owners to find mods that are immune to takedown notices, as, according to commenters on Cfx’s news post, dozens of paid, non-Rockstar-authorized mods have been banned in the past for featuring third-party assets.</span><span><br> </span><span><br> </span><span>The timing is also somewhat suspicious, as this “initial launch” looks a lot like a trial run for a </span><i><span>Grand Theft Auto VI</span></i><span> mod marketplace to me. I’d also be curious to find out exactly how much of a cut, if any, Rockstar Games and Take-Two are getting from these purchases, although said information is seemingly absent from any of the official Cfx Marketplace news posts.</span></p>

            <title><![CDATA[Forza Horizon 6 Will Take Fans To Japan Soon According To New Leak]]></title>
            <link>https://kotaku.com/forza-horizon-6-leak-release-date-may-xbox-direct-2026-ps5-japan-2000659807</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Next week, <em>Forza Horizon 6</em> is set to be one of the main focuses of Xbox’s upcoming Dev Direct Showcase. But thanks to an in-game leak, we don’t have to wait until then to find out when the open-world racer will launch. And thankfully, we’ll be speeding around Japan soon when <em>Horizon 6</em> arrives in May.</p> <p>On January 14, <a href="https://x.com/XBOXF10/status/2011429719800180925/photo/1">Xbox Infinite</a>, an Xbox news account based in Saudi Arabia, posted a screenshot on Twitter of what it claims to be an ad for <em>Forza Horizon 6</em> that popped up ahead of schedule. The ad claims that <a href="https://kotaku.com/forza-horizon-6-location-microsoft-tokyo-game-show-2000628658"><em>Forza Horizon 6, </em>which was officially announced in September 2025,</a>&nbsp;will be available to play four days early, on May 15, for those who pre-order the Premium Edition of the game. This implies that <em>Horizon 6</em>‘s actual release date is May 19. <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/forza-horizon-6s-release-date-may-have-been-revealed-early-by-an-in-game-ad/"><em>VGC</em> reports</a> that its sources have confirmed this release window as accurate.</p>

 <p>“Discover the breathtaking landscapes of Japan in over 550 real-world cars and become a racing Legend in <em>Forza Horizon’</em>s biggest open world driving adventure yet,” reads text included in the ad. Here’s the list of what else you get for pre-ordering the Premium Edition, according to this leaked promo:</p>

 <blockquote><p>• Early Access – Play 4 days early, starting May 15<br> • VIP Membership<br> • Welcome Pack<br> . Car Pass<br> • Time Attack Car Pack<br> • Italian Passion Car Pack (coming post-launch)<br> • 2 Premium Expansions (coming post-launch)</p></blockquote> <p><a href="https://x.com/XBOXF10/status/2011452908550926481">According to Xbox Infinite,</a> the leaked ad appeared as they were playing a different <em>Forza</em> game. <em>Kotaku</em> can’t confirm if the ad is real, but we’ve seen things like this before, and <em>VGC</em> corroborating the release window seems to verify this is a real leak.</p>

 <p>It also makes sense that it popped up now, just a week before the Dev Direct event. Some wires got crossed, it seems, but we can likely expect the release date and more to be confirmed on January 22 at the showcase. Also expected at the event is <em>Pokémon</em> studio <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/pokemon-developer-game-freak-reveals-beast-of-reincarnation-at-xbox-games-showcase">GameFreak’s AAA action RPG </a><em>Beast of Reincarnation,</em> as well as a deep dive into the oft-delayed <em>Fable</em> reboot. <em>Forza Horizon 6</em> is launching on Xbox, PC, and Game Pass, with a PS5 port rumored to arrive at a later date.</p>
