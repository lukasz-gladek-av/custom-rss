              <p>I’ve mostly enjoyed the second season of Amazon and Bethesda’s live-action <em>Fallout</em> TV show. One thing I hated about this new season, however, was that each new episode premiered at midnight. Thankfully, Amazon is changing this release schedule for the rest of the season.</p> <p>On January 26, Amazon Prime Video announced its plans to release the next (and final) two episodes of <a href="https://kotaku.com/heres-why-fans-are-convinced-fallout-3-and-new-vegas-remasters-are-about-to-be-revealed-2000660161"><em>Fallout</em></a> season two at 6 p.m. PT instead of midnight. Season two episode seven will now arrive on Tuesday, January 27, and episode eight will be available on Tuesday, February 3.</p>

 <p>“Good morning, Vault Dwellers!” posted Amazon on Twitter. “Due to strong participation and interest, we have amended the start times for the remaining Season Two presentations.”</p> <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">Good morning, Vault Dwellers! Due to strong participation and interest, we have amended the start times for the remaining Season Two presentations. Episode Seven will now begin Tuesday, Jan. 27 at 6 p.m. PT, and Episode Eight will now begin Tuesday, Feb. 3 at 6 p.m. PT. Your… <a href="https://t.co/x1LhnwEsRL">pic.twitter.com/x1LhnwEsRL</a></p> <p>— FALLOUT⚡️ (@falloutonprime) <a href="https://twitter.com/falloutonprime/status/2015832890433552799?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 26, 2026</a></p></blockquote>  <p>While I’ve been a fan of the weekly rollout of <em>Fallout</em> season two, as it allows my friend group time to watch and then later chat about each episode at the same time as the internet, I really, really hated the midnight release time. It made it harder for sites to cover, made it more annoying for people to avoid spoilers the following morning, and didn’t really seem to have any benefit other than that some night owls got to watch the latest episode a bit earlier than everyone else. So I’m very happy with this change!</p>

 <p>In fact, it should work this way when <em>Fallout</em> season three arrives in the future. <a href="https://www.aboutamazon.com/news/entertainment/fallout-season-2-season-3-prime-video">Amazon already confirmed a third season is on the way</a>, and I’ll be madder than a Deathclaw with a dart in its leg if the streaming giant decides to go back to midnight releases for that next round of episodes.</p>

 <p>Meanwhile, if you haven’t been keeping up with <em>Fallout</em> season two but you are a big fan of the games, <a href="https://kotaku.com/fallout-season-2-finally-brings-back-two-classic-pieces-of-the-franchise-2000661833">you should at least check out who showed up in a recent episode, as it’s a very cool surprise for longtime players.</a></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/highguard-launch-pc-ps5-free-to-play-servers-is-it-good-titanfall-apex-2000663135"><em>Highguard</em> is out on PS5, Xbox, and PC</a> and it’s been a weird day for the unique new hero shooter. There were <a href="https://kotaku.com/drdisrespect-lies-about-being-invited-to-highguard-preview-event-2000663184">false claims</a> it had worked with disgraced streamer DrDisrespect and a myriad of technical issues plaguing its first hours on Steam. Now, as the dust settles, <em>Highguard</em> has racked up over 9,000 reviews on Valve’s storefront, but the vast majority are negative.</p> <p>On January 26, after a period of radio silence <a href="https://kotaku.com/highguard-game-awards-trailer-rust-hero-shooter-interview-2000663137">following its reveal at the 2025 Game Awards</a>, <em>Highguard</em> launched for free, offering players a 3v3 PVP “raid shooter” experience complete with destructible environments and cool mounts to ride into battle on. However, shortly after the game’s launch, players began reporting problems. One of the first was that many, myself included, couldn’t even play <em>Highguard</em> due to the overwhelmed servers. Far from the worst issue to have on launch day.</p>

 <p>Once players got in, many reported performance issues on PC, with rigs equipped with high-end hardware still struggling to play <em>Highguard</em> at a steady framerate. And after getting through all that, some players have found matches in <em>Highguard</em> boring and slow, complaining that the 3v3 format and large map don’t mix well. Sprinkle in some bad-faith users attacking the game for looking “woke,” whatever the hell that means, and you end up with a horrible Steam review rating.</p> <h2>What is <em>Highguard’s</em> Steam review rating?</h2> <p>As of 5:10 p.m. EST, <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/4128260/Highguard/#app_reviews_hash"><em>Highguard</em> has 9,442 user reviews on Steam</a> across all languages. Of those nearly 10,000 reviews, <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/4128260/charts/#:~:text=19.8%25%20positive%20reviews-,7%2C230,-80.2%25%20negative%20reviews">SteamDB data shows 7,230 of them are negative</a>. This adds up to a “Mostly Negative” status on Steam with fewer than 2,000 positive reviews. Ouch. <a href="https://store.playstation.com/en-us/concept/10012011">Over on the PlayStation Store,</a> things are better, with <em>Highguard</em> sitting at nearly 2,000 reviews and a 3.34 out of 5-star rating.</p>

 <p>It might be easy to assume this is some nefarious review bombing, and I do think <em>some</em> of this can be <a href="https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=highguard+woke">blamed on bad actors and annoying chuds</a>. But scrolling through the reviews does show a lot of players just don’t seem to like the slow pace of the game and the 3v3 format.</p>

 <p>“The maps in this game are way too big for 3v3; the size would fit better for 5v5 or 6v6,” posted one Steam reviewer. “In the looting stage, the map is too big and empty considering it’s only 3v3, and the only things in it are red and blue chests (and the crystals i guess),” shared another user. “The 3v3 format on such a huge map just doesn’t click for me, and the overall experience becomes chaotic without bringing anything new to the table,” said someone else.</p> <p>Of course, it should be noted that not even 12 hours have passed since <em>Highguard’s</em> launch. So all of these reviews are based on a dozen or so matches or less. The real question will be what happens in the next few days, weeks, and months–assuming <em>Highguard</em> sticks around that long–and if the devs can turn the ship around.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Replacing Your Gamer Friends With AI Chatbots Sounds Terrifyingly Effective]]></title>
            <link>https://kotaku.com/escape-tarkov-ai-chatbot-quest-ai-chatgpt-2000663213</link>
            <guid>1416913</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><span>You are not immune to AI psychosis. Much like cult indoctrination, it can happen to anyone given the right circumstances. Take Matthew Gault, games and tech writer at </span><i><span>404 Media</span></i><span>. After failing to convince his friends to play </span><i><span>Escape from Tarkov</span></i><span> with him, Gault thought it would be funny to </span><a href="https://www.404media.co/i-replaced-my-friends-with-ai-because-they-wont-play-tarkov-with-me/"><span>replace his buddies with an AI chatbot</span></a><span>. It ended up not being very funny at all.</span></p> <p><span>Gault is a self-described “certified AI hater,” though he concedes that LLM technology is useful in certain instances (I agree to disagree with Gault’s assertion that offloading transcription to an environmentally catastrophic machine built on stolen labor saves valuable time and energy). Gault’s friends were turned off by the difficulty of </span><i><span>Escape from Tarkov</span></i><span>, an extraction shooter which came out of early access last November. He described playing by himself as lonely. “Then I saw comic artist Zach Weinersmith making fun of a service, Questie.AI, that sells AI avatars that’ll hang out with you while you play video games,” he writes.</span></p>

 <p><span>What started as a joke quickly became more sincere. Gault found he genuinely enjoyed playing </span><i><span>Tarkov</span></i><span> with his Quest.AI companion, Wolf. “It was, I thought, not unlike playing with a friend who has more than 1,000 hours in the game and knows more than you. Wolf bantered, referenced community in-jokes, and it made me laugh.”</span></p> <p><span>Gault was surprised and concerned by his own enjoyment of the chatbot, his previous confusion over how people could fall victim to AI psychosis replaced by understanding. He states he will not continue using Quest.AI: “I never thought anything like [AI psychosis] could happen to me. Now I’m not so sure. I didn’t understand how easy it might be to lose yourself to AI delusion until I’d messed around with Wolf. Even with its shitty auto-tuned sounding voice, Wolf was good enough to hang out with.”</span></p>

 <p><span>Gault’s experiment ended with his real friends making fun of him for using Quest.AI by ironically using another LLM, ChatGPT, to send messages to him. Gault’s account is another entry in the emerging genre of seemingly normal people jokingly using AI chatbots and discovering things can get weird very quickly. YouTuber Eddy Burback popularized the phenomenon with his chilling </span><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRjgNgJms3Q"><span>documentary</span></a><span> “ChatGPT made me delusional,” which has garnered over 4 million views in the past two months. As Silicon Valley continues to shove LLM technology down our collective throats, it feels like only a matter of time until even more strains of AI psychosis—both simulated and sincere—begin to emerge. </span></p>

            <title><![CDATA[Steam Game Devs Call Exploit Allegations ‘Clickbait Exaggeration’ And ‘Malicious Defamation’]]></title>
            <link>https://kotaku.com/screeps-world-steam-game-exploit-pc-hack-2000663214</link>
            <guid>1416898</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><span>The developers behind a popular “open source MMO RTS sandbox game for programming enthusiasts” on Steam, named </span><i><span>Screeps: World,</span></i><span> have been forced to update their game “in order to protect both players” and their “own reputation,” following the discovery of an alleged “remote code execution vulnerability” that would enable players to take control of other players’ computers. Even worse, the person who helped discover the vulnerability in question alleges that Valve “ignored” their reported findings.</span></p> <p><span>If you’re noticing an overabundance of quotes in the previous paragraph, there’s a good reason for that, as this story spawned out of a rather nasty back-and-forth </span><a href="https://x.com/IsaacKing314/status/2015195819251736630?s=20"><span>on X</span></a><span> between </span><i><span>Screeps: World’s</span></i><span> developers Screeps, LLC and an “information security” aficionado by the name of Isaac King.</span></p>

 <p><span>As King explained in his initial post, </span><i><span>Screeps: World</span></i><span> apparently allowed “any other player in the game world to gain remote access to your computer” through the use of a programming exploit. For context, </span><i><span>Screeps: World</span></i><span> is a programming game that lets players write their own code in JavaScript, which is then used to craft their own custom-made AI units.</span></p> <figure id="attachment_2000663224" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000663224"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000663224">©Screeps, LLC</figcaption></figure> <p><span>As of this writing, the game is currently sitting at a “Very Positive” review score on Steam, having amassed roughly 1,876 reviews and, according to </span><a href="https://app.sensortower.com/vgi/game/screeps-world"><span>VG Insights</span></a><span>, over 113,000 individual purchases.</span></p>

 <p><span>If you want the exact explanation of the reputed vulnerability, I highly suggest reading King’s highly detailed write-up of the exploit </span><a href="https://outsidetheasylum.blog/screeps/"><span>on his blog</span></a><span>. I will, however, warn you in advance that it requires (at least) a base understanding of JavaScript to fully understand.</span></p>

 <p><span>Thankfully, King includes an analogy for “non-programmers” in the conclusion: “imagine if there were one particular kind of unit in </span><i><span>Starcraft</span></i><span> that, if you trained it, let people hack your computer. And when pointed out, the game designers said ‘well this is self-inflicted, the players all chose to train that unit’.”</span></p> <p><span>King also explains that the developers have been aware of the issue since July 2024, as one of Screeps, LLC’s two developers replied to a report </span><a href="https://github.com/screeps/screeps/issues/162#issuecomment-2223049479"><span>on GitHub</span></a><span> detailing the vulnerability. The dev in question replied, stating that they “do not see this as a serious security threat.” However, a user from the Screeps Discord </span><a href="https://outsidetheasylum.blog/screeps/usage.png"><span>noted</span></a><span> that the vulnerability had been successfully abused in the past.</span></p>

 <p><span>Once the initial post on X began to gain traction, the official Screeps X account replied stating that the accusation was “at the very least, a clickbait exaggeration, and at worst, malicious defamation intended to cause reputational damage.” Nevertheless, they also stated that the alleged vulnerability has, as of January 25, been removed from </span><i><span>Screeps: World</span></i><span>.</span></p> <p><span>The potentially more worrying side of this is that King noted in his blog post that he’d reported the issue to Steam directly, but didn’t receive a reply: “I reported the game to Steam, which of course they ignored. Their terms of service make them not liable for any hacks caused by malware on the platform, so if it’s getting sales from which they can take a cut, why do anything about it?”</span></p> <p><span>We’ve reached out to Valve to corroborate this, and will update the piece if they reply.</span></p>

            <guid>1416859</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Once-ubiquitous online game streamer Herschel “Dr Disrespect” Beahm, who was banned from Twitch after <a href="https://kotaku.com/dr-disrespect-twitch-ban-sexting-minor-response-1851559888">sending “inappropriate” messages to a minor in 2017</a>, posted a photo of a media badge on January 26 and said he had been invited to a pre-release hands-on event for the newly released, free-to-play raid shooter <em>Highguard</em>. However, multiple people who attended the event denied seeing him there, and some Reddit users believe his photo was faked with gen AI or Photoshop. And <em>Highguard’s</em> creator manager says he wasn’t invited and didn’t attend.</p> <p>On Monday, ahead of the launch of <em>Highguard</em>, DrDisrespect posted an image of a keyboard, a can of energy drink, a personalized controller, and a <em>Highguard</em> media badge with his name on it to his X account. He claimed to have played <em>Highguard</em> at a recent media event in Los Angeles. “Last week we took the Lambo to LA to check out #Highguard,” he wrote. “Monday, January 26th at 10am PST, we enter another dimension! Yayayaya.”</p>

 <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">Last week we took the Lambo to LA to check out <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/Highguard?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#Highguard</a>.</p> <p>Monday, January 26th at 10am PST, we enter another dimension!</p> <p>Yayayaya <a href="https://t.co/kQ56GEfonB">pic.twitter.com/kQ56GEfonB</a></p> <p>— Dr Disrespect (@DrDisrespect) <a href="https://twitter.com/DrDisrespect/status/2015156898040049967?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 24, 2026</a></p></blockquote>  <p>Immediately, people online began sharing the post and claiming the PR team behind <em>Highguard</em> had made a huge mistake inviting someone like DrDisrespect to the event. The streamer was suddenly banned from <a href="https://kotaku.com/dr-disrespect-sexting-twitch-ban-youtube-elden-ring-1851556854">Twitch in June 2020</a> and then later lost sponsorships and other business deals after confirming he’d once sent messages that were “inappropriate” but not “illegal” to someone else on the platform who was under the age of 18. He now streams exclusively on Rumble and YouTube, which allowed his channel to be monetized again after <a href="https://kotaku.com/drdisrespect-twitch-ban-minor-youtube-monetization-1851752083">a multi-month review of the allegations</a>.</p> <p>“Choosing to work with a self-admitted pedophile to market your game is certainly…A choice,” <a href="https://x.com/EpicNNG/status/2015836937865634276">posted a game dev and writer.</a>&nbsp; “Never heard of <em>Highguard</em>. Is it good marketing to have the first news about your game that some people hear be that you invited a pedophile to your preview event?”<a href="https://bsky.app/profile/alyssamerc.bsky.social/post/3mddtienlps2x/quotes"> posted someone else on BlueSky.</a></p>

 <p>But, not long after the post started going viral online, creators came out to deny that DrDisrespect was ever at the event, claiming he was lying about being invited.</p>   <p>“Dr. Disrespect was not invited to the early access event,” <a href="https://x.com/TheMacroShow/status/2015875906271904060?s=20">posted creator Macro on Twitter</a>. “I know this because I WAS THERE, and I promise you, everyone would’ve noticed that pedo a mile away. There’s so many valid things you can criticize <em>Highguard</em> for, but this isn’t one of them.” Kate Sánchez, the EIC of<em> ButWhyTho</em>, <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/ohmymithrandir.bsky.social/post/3mddwfcpcf22h">also denied he was there, adding</a>: “I literally did not see him there – unless creators had a different day.” Another content creator, <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/blessingjr.bsky.social/post/3mddxvxapqs2q"><em>Kinda Funny</em>‘s Blessing Adeoye Jr</a>., also believed DrDisrespect was not at the LA event, but said there was a second day for creators only. Sánchez and Adeoye Jr. didn’t attend the creator day.</p>

 <p><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/chinpua?originalSubdomain=ca"><em>Highguard</em> creator manager Chin Pua</a> replied to a viral tweet about DrDisrespect and <a href="https://x.com/thingscp/status/2015884206329463060">confirmed that he</a> “was not invited to any <em>Highguard</em> event past or present, and the badge was not an official badge.”&nbsp;<em>Kotaku</em> has reached out to <em>Highguard</em> PR but has yet to hear back.&nbsp; A freelancer <em>Kotaku</em> sent to the event didn’t see DrDisrespect at the press day either.</p> <p>Over on the <em>Highguard</em> subreddit, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/HighGuardgame/comments/1qnd1vl/is_dr_disrespects_badge_fake/">some players are theorizing that DrDisrespect faked the image</a> using AI tools or Photoshop. The evidence involves how the media badge looks compared to other real, confirmed badges from the event. It does seem like, if he were there, he was given a somewhat unusual badge with a different layout than other attendees. If DrDisrespect didn’t attend, he has yet to publicly confirm that on social media or elsewhere. He also streamed the game on <a href="https://x.com/DrDisrespect/status/2015815750825730082">Rumble and YouTube</a> on launch day.</p>
