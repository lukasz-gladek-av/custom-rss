              <p>Amazon skipped laptop deals during Prime Day, but it clearly saved the best for the back-to-school rush. And honestly, you don’t have to be a student to appreciate the kind of discounts popping up right now. Maybe the best deal is on this HP 15.6-inch laptop with Intel i3 processor, massive 32GB RAM, and great 1TB solid-state drive. The <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3843/">normal price is $2499, yet Amazon has chopped it all the way down to $499</a>: <strong>that’s 80% off and basically one-fifth of what you’d usually pay</strong>. On top of that, it carries an impressive 4.7 out of 5 rating from buyers.</p>

<h2>Why You Should Consider Buying It</h2>
<p>First off, the memory and storage bundle is significantly more than you’d get at this pricing: With 32GB of DDR4 RAM, you’re not bogged down with chores on a daily level. It means having dozens of tabs in your browser open, video streaming and you still have room to breathe. And then there’s the 1TB PCIe SSD. That amount of fast storage doesn’t just give loads of space for files, movies, and software — it also gets the laptop up and running in a snap.</p>
<p>The processor inside it is built to handle everyday needs with ease: It’s an Intel N100, capable of up to 3.4GHz when Turbo Boost kicks in. Yes, it’s not a workstation beast or a gaming processor, but for project-carrying students or remote workers with conferencing apps, it delivers. Coupled with Intel UHD Graphics, it can manage regular entertainment like Netflix or even light edit work without breaking a sweat.</p>



<p>The display is significant as well, and in this case, you’re getting a 15.6-inch Full HD (1920×1080) display. It’s anti-glare to make working in bright lights or in windows less stressful and its thin bezels give you more usable screen space in a footprint that’s not intimidating. At 250 nits of brightness and with 45% NTSC color, it’s aimed at comfortable streaming.</p>
<p>Despite the big screen and powerful internals, it weighs just 3.64 pounds and measures only 0.73 inches thick. That makes it easy to slip into a backpack or carry between classes or office meetings. The inclusion of WiFi 6E keeps you connected quickly and dependably and Bluetooth 5.3 has you pairing headphones and other peripherals effortlessly. The laptop adds a couple of ports as well: a USB-C, two USB-A, HDMI, and a headphone jack.</p>
<p>Plugged into Windows 11 Pro, this machine is ready for work right out of the box. You’re greeted with a bare-bones interface, Microsoft’s latest apps, and business-class features that help with security and workflow on a day-to-day basis.</p>
<p>All of that for $499, and you can see why this buy is so surprising.</p>
