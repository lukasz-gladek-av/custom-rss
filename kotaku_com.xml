The esports pro was banned for inappropriate behavior during the livestreamed event and subsequently dropped from his team, Cloud9. “I’m sorry everyone,” he wrote afterwards. “Wish I was better. I had it all and fucking tossed it in the trashcan.”</p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="197586" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="Disney+ Pulls The Abyss Over Controversial Rat Scene — Again" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="128" data-playlist="197586,197585,197583" data-current="197586"><div><p>Disney+ Pulls The Abyss Over Controversial Rat Scene — Again</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197586/197586_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197586/197586_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197586/197586_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/23107.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>The Beerio Kart World Cup event was organized by Twitch streamer Ludwig Ahgren and, for anyone unfamilliar with the general concept, featured various online personalities competing in the recently released <em>Mario Kart World </em>while driving under the influence. People got more inebriated as the tournament progressed, with Marquez in particular eventually ditching his Wario costume and walking around shirtless.</p><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://twitter.com/LSF_Forwarder/status/1936735705905909912?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1936735705905909912%7Ctwgr%5Ee6199bbf3867ad16a635891e580ec302a3687341%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fkinja.com%2Fembed%2Finset%2Fiframe%3Fautosize%3D1id%3Dtwitter-1936735705905909912&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://twitter.com/LSF_Forwarder/status/1936735705905909912?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1936735705905909912%7Ctwgr%5Ee6199bbf3867ad16a635891e580ec302a3687341%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fkinja.com%2Fembed%2Finset%2Fiframe%3Fautosize%3D1id%3Dtwitter-1936735705905909912" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">A clip from the livestream</a></span> at one point showed him appearing to drunkenly dry-hump behind Twitch streamer Maya Higa who was sitting next to Emily “ExtraEmily” Zhang while they talked to the livestream camera. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://x.com/SICunchained/status/1936793274196410781&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://x.com/SICunchained/status/1936793274196410781" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Multiple other clips</a></span> show him seemingly continue to act inappropriately toward the pair at other points during the event. The livestream shows various people calling out Mang0's behavior during the <em>Mario Kart </em>tournament, though it’s not clear that any of the organizers intervened at the time. </p><p>“I reached out to anyone who I thought might have felt uncomfortable and talked to them but also, and I already told Mang0 this, no longer inviting Mang0 to Mogul Moves events,” Ludwig said in a June 22 livestream, referencing his company that organized the tournament. “It’s a privilege to go to an event, the whole point of an event is it’s a fun thing to do, to have a good ass time and if somebody appearing jeopardizes somebody else having a good time that just can’t be a thing.”</p><p>On June 23, Marquez acknowledged the incident and said he had a problem with alcohol. “Sorry to everyone I’ve let down or hurt,” he wrote on X. “I know it just looks like I’m trying to save face but I genuinely feel so awful about it.. all I’ve done is reflect on my life and realized I’m a broken human   I will try and redeem myself over time as I always do  Gonna stop drinking immediately and get it together.”</p><p>Later that day, however, Cloud9, the team which Marquez has been representing in <em>Smash Bros.</em> tournaments for over a decade, announced it was parting ways with the esports player. “Following an internal evaluation, we have made the decision to release mang0 from Cloud9,” it <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://x.com/Cloud9/status/1937299762119868534&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://x.com/Cloud9/status/1937299762119868534" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">wrote in a statement</a></span>. “Regardless of tenure or accomplishments, the behavior demonstrated is entirely unacceptable and directly conflicts with our organization’s core values. We maintain a zero-tolerance stance regarding harassment or any other form of inappropriate conduct.”</p><p>It’s unclear how the Beerio Kart World Cup incident will impact Marquez’s involvement in the <em>Smash Bros.</em> competitive scene moving forward. One of the next big events, Supernova 2025, takes place in August. Currently ranked third among all <em>Melee</em> players, Marquez suggested he might be taking a break. “C9 dropping me. Probably getting banned from tourneys. Fucking shit man,” he <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://x.com/C9Mang0/status/1937295807285461185&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://x.com/C9Mang0/status/1937295807285461185" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">wrote on X</a></span>. “No one to blame but myself but man. Never though I could hit this low. Probably won’t hear from me for a while   I’m sorry everyone.”<br></p><p>.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://kotaku.com/mang0-ludwig-beerio-mario-kart-world-cup-harassment-1851785025]]></content:encoded>
