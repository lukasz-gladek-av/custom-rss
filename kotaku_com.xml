              <p>What would <em>Red Dead Redemption 2</em> be like if your fights with people and creatures played out like matches in <em>Mortal Kombat</em>? That’s the thought experiment at the center of <a href="https://kotaku.com/twitch-streamer-blurbs-elder-scrolls-v-skyrim-voice-mod-1851443327">streamer Blurbs</a>‘ latest mod for the Rockstar open-world game. There’s lots of punching, lots of blood, and some downright nuts fatalities.</p> <p>Blurbs has transformed mod-making into a communal activity by having fans contribute ideas and constructing and testing them in real time as viewers <a href="https://www.youtube.com/redirect?event=comments&amp;redir_token=QUFFLUhqbmhOVmdlUEJCc3RCVDZkLUhBTF9IMkI0MWhEZ3xBQ3Jtc0trVmQ1WjdyS3JDZjJ3VFBoVXh0Y2VUZ09OYWdKY2tBRUhzTS1aRVMzcUJOUGhHZFRPNWRjUXB5a0pHTFNDTDdBQWYzWTdSc2I2ekxIT3p1YmJEYkJKLVdrRFkxcG1wVUptVURnQmVuMjRrNUdSTVRDYw&amp;q=https%3A%2F%2Ftwitch.tv%2Fblurbs">watch on Twitch</a>.&nbsp; Last time it was a <em>Red Dead Redemption 2</em> mod that shows you <a href="https://kotaku.com/red-dead-redemption-2-mod-video-npc-memories-blurbs-2000631070">the dying memories</a> of all the NPCs you murder. Now, for <em>Red Dead Mortal Kombat</em>, he starts with a basic mechanic where any time you punch someone, the camera flips to a side-by-side view like a fighting game and builds from there.</p>

  <p>Blurbs even went ahead and added rudimentary animations, sound effects, and cheat codes that need to be entered for fatalities. In one, Arthur Morgan lets out a tuberculosis-filled cough that makes the opponent explode in a geyser of blood. In another, the loser is pushed out in front of a runaway train that obliterates them.</p>

 <p>But the mod doesn’t just allow Arthur to fight people. In the video above showing off the mod, Blurbs also has Arthur go head-to-head with an alligator, a deer, and a grizzly bear. That last one does not go well for him.</p> <p>He’s currently taking requests for <em>Grand Theft Auto V</em> mods.&nbsp;“My whole mission is overproducing really dumb ideas that no one else would ever think to make,” he told&nbsp;<em>Kotaku</em>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>On October 15, the devs behind <a href="https://kotaku.com/battlefield-6-review-steam-ps5-campaign-multiplayer-2000633379"><em>Battlefield 6</em></a> announced that the game’s most popular mode, Conquest, would be tweaked in a big way that would potentially lead to shorter matches. This change was nearly universally hated by the online <em>Battlefield</em> community, and now, just 48 hours later, EA is reversing course as it continues to promise tweaks and fixes for the recently released online FPS.</p> <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/battlefield-6-steam-record-login-queue-multiplayer-download-issue-2000634042"><em>Battlefield 6</em> launched last week to massive sales and high player numbers</a>, making it already one of the most successful entries in the long-running milsim series. But, as with any popular online video game these days, a lot of players online have spent nearly every day since launch offering feedback, complaining, or pointing out problems that need to be fixed. And EA is working on a lot of this, with fixes incoming for <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/battlefield-6-players-biggest-enemy-may-be-the-in-game-sun/1100-6535525/">overly bright maps</a>, <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/fps/battlefield-6-devs-are-trying-to-find-the-balance-between-zoomers-and-battledads-following-movement-nerfs-were-looking-at-adjustments-for-sure-to-find-a-good-in-between/">tweaks to movement</a>, <a href="https://kotaku.com/battlefield-ghost-bullets-update-hotfix-network-bloom-2000635677">and more</a>. But among these many recent changes, one caught players on Reddit and social media off guard. For some reason, EA and Battlefield Studios lowered the ticket count for all levels when playing <em>BF6</em>‘s flagship mode, Conquest. And oh boy, were people mad about this change.</p>

 <p>For those not familiar with Conquest in <a href="https://kotaku.com/battlefield-6-reveal-la-event-behind-the-scenes-brie-larson-ea-2000614190"><em>BF6</em></a>, the mode is all about capturing various points on large maps and holding them. The more you hold, the slower your ticket count ticks down. And any time a player dies and respawns, a ticket is also removed from that team. The side that hits 0 first loses. Before October 15, every map in <em>BF6</em> featured 1000 tickets for both sides. <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Battlefield/comments/1o7bxf9/bfcomms_conquest_ticket_count_update_1510/">But then that was tweaked</a>, with different, lower starting ticket values depending on which map you were playing. EA claimed this was because battles were going on too long and timing out, so the idea was that lower ticket counts would lead to more matches ending because a team hit 0 and not because the timer ran out.</p>

 <p>This tweak angered many online as it seemed like something nobody was asking for. Likewise, many players, myself included, have played for many days now and have never seen a match end due to the timer running out. Other players were also mad because for them, <em>Battlefield’s</em> Conquest mode has always been about long matches that go back and forth for upwards of 20 minutes. As many pointed out online in thousands of messages and posts, if you want shorter matches, there are plenty of modes in <em>BF6</em> that offer that experience. Lowering the ticket count ultimately felt like a solution for a problem that didn’t exist, and EA seemingly agrees because it’s already reversed course on the controversial change.</p>

 <p>On October 17, <a href="https://x.com/BattlefieldComm/status/1979118925699747944">the official <em>Battlefield</em> social media account on Twitter posted</a> that the devs had “heard your feedback” and the studio was reverting the change.</p> <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">We've heard your feedback about the recent reduction of Conquest starting tickets and will be reverting the ticket count across all maps to their original launch value of 1,000 and 45 minute timed rounds.</p> <p>Please note that on larger maps such as Mirak Valley and Firestorm this…</p> <p>— Battlefield Comms (@BattlefieldComm) <a href="https://twitter.com/BattlefieldComm/status/1979118925699747944?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 17, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <p>“We’ve heard your feedback about the recent reduction of Conquest starting tickets and will be reverting the ticket count across all maps to their original launch value of 1,000 and 45-minute timed rounds,” posted the official account. “Please note that on larger maps such as Mirak Valley and Firestorm, this change may lead to longer match durations. We’ll continue monitoring player feedback and gameplay data to ensure the pacing and overall flow of matches feel right.”</p>

 <p>It’s very odd to me that EA seems so concerned about long matches in Conquest, as that’s always been how the mode works, something other players pointed out in the comments below. I think the best way to solve this problem is to just add a “Fast Conquest” mode that has fewer tickets and is all about keeping matches short. Players who really prefer that version of Conquest can go enjoy it, and everyone else can grind away in 40-minute matches that go back and forth.</p> <p>In fact, I’d love to see EA do some official playlists that feature 2000-ticket matches, as sometimes I just want to spend an hour fighting in Operation Firestorm, you know? At least for now, <em>Battlefield 6</em>‘s most iconic mode is back to normal, and just in time for <a href="https://kotaku.com/battlefield-6-reveal-la-event-behind-the-scenes-brie-larson-ea-2000614190">some big XP changes that should make it easier to unlock new gear</a>.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/switch-2-rog-xbox-ally-x-pc-gaming-handheld-comparison-2000636643</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/the-switch-2-holding-its-own-against-a-top-pc-gaming-handheld-feels-like-a-small-miracle.1328167/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Over the last couple of days I’ve seen some people using the Switch 2 <a href="https://x.com/Omnipotentgam0r/status/1978596002836734372">as a cudgel</a> with which to knock down <a href="https://kotaku.com/rog-xbox-ally-x-review-performance-issues-steam-deck-switch-2-2000635652">the new ROG Xbox Ally X</a>. And admittedly, comparisons of games like <em>Cyberpunk 2077</em> running on both certainly don’t look nearly as stark as the price difference between the two handhelds. However, I don’t see that as a loss for the new premium PC gaming handheld so much as a win for Nintendo’s latest console.</p> <p>I’ve been going back and replaying a fair bit of CD Projekt Red’s 2020 open-world RPG on both machines and frequently find myself straining to feel a significant difference. I run through the streets of the <em>Phantom Liberty</em> expansion’s Dog Town on the Xbox Ally X using AMD’s recommended settings and the in-game graphics on high while in the performance power mode. I get 40-50fps, the lighting looks decent, and the textures are just detailed and clean enough to not draw my eye, letting me stay immersed in the world and action.</p>

 <figure id="attachment_2000636661" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000636661"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000636661"><em>Cyberpunk 2077</em> on the Ally X (left) and Switch 2 (right)</figcaption></figure> <p>Then I move over to Switch 2 thanks to the (occasionally finnicky) cloudsave syncing feature. While <em>Cyberpunk 2077</em> will run around 40fps in performance mode on Nintendo’s hybrid handheld, I don’t find the extra smoothness that worth it. Instead, I prefer the extra layer of clarity and visual vibrancy from the quality graphics mode. The action is still smooth. The world feels much the same. Pretty soon I can barely remember what looked different with the game running on the Xbox Ally X, let alone worry about going back to the more powerful hardware.</p>

 <p>I’ve spent more than a few minutes scrutinizing a handful of screenshots of the game running on both devices and man, it takes some effort to start spotting the differences.</p> <figure id="attachment_2000636659" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000636659"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000636659">CD Projekt Red / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <figure id="attachment_2000636660" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000636660"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000636660">CD Projekt Red / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p>Can you tell which is which? Stare long enough and you’ll start to see some bits of the second image that look a little less distinct, especially the farther you go into the background. The shadows and lighting aren’t as smoothly mixed in the second one either. After a few moments of intently searching it for imperfection, you might, like me, come away thinking it just looks a bit more&nbsp;<em>brittle</em> overall. The second image is indeed from the Switch 2 running the game in handheld mode. Does it look $550 worse? Not even close.</p>

 <p>The Switch 2 version of <em>Star Wars Outlaws</em> also seems to hold up pretty well in certain comparisons. There’s less detail. The framerate is worse. But it’s not necessarily <em>that</em> much less detail, or<em> that</em> much worse of a framerate.</p> <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">More comparisons of ROG Ally X vs Switch 2,for Star Wars Outlaws and Hogwarts legacy. Switch 2 again for the most part obliterating the ROG in image fidelity.<br>Switch 2 is also rumored to be getting an upgrade for its DLSS tech soon,so it’ll get even better<a href="https://t.co/cL3iRC5hOb">https://t.co/cL3iRC5hOb</a> <a href="https://t.co/PXIfyeidOb">https://t.co/PXIfyeidOb</a> <a href="https://t.co/mnGEstkn5A">pic.twitter.com/mnGEstkn5A</a></p> <p>— 💫Sonicpulsar💫 (@sonicpulsar) <a href="https://twitter.com/sonicpulsar/status/1978717824341119479?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 16, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <p>It’s weird to see Nintendo hardware holding its own rather than fighting for its life against more powerful alternatives. For now, at least, the Switch 2 feels more than just “good enough.”</p>

 <p>Now comparing the Switch 2 to the Xbox Ally X isn’t completely apples-to-apples. The Asus-made, Xbox-branded handheld has a slightly smaller screen, it runs Windows, and it plays tons more games that weren’t painstakingly optimized for it like <em>Cyberpunk 2077</em> was for the Switch 2. The fact that a five-year-old game doesn’t look lightyears better on the one doesn’t completely disqualify it.</p>

 <p>The new Ally X also affords a prospective user all sorts of options and perks that the Switch 2 doesn’t, not least of all a pair of ergonomic grips and thumbsticks that actually feel great to hold and use right out of the box. There are also plenty of moments when it does look distinctly superior, in addition to having access to a vast library of PC games that might never come to Nintendo’s platform.</p>

 <figure id="attachment_2000636663" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000636663"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000636663"><em>Cyberpunk 2077</em> on the Xbox Ally X.</figcaption></figure> <figure id="attachment_2000636662" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000636662"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000636662"><em>Cyberpunk 2077</em> on the Switch 2 (handheld performance mode)</figcaption></figure> <p>But the match-up does suggest a promising future for the Switch 2. We’ll have to see how the the finished port of <em>Final Fantasy VII Remake</em> runs on it when it arrives early next year, but what I tested back in August felt similarly impressive. <em>Borderlands 4</em> and <em>Elden Ring</em> might also shape up nicely. And given its success with<em> Star Wars Outlaws</em>, I’m expecting the recently leaked port of <em>Assassin’s Creed Shadows</em> on Switch 2 to be impressive as well.</p> <p>Look, this is only the first year of the Switch 2’s life. We could be in a situation come 2027 where most new blockbusters still have to skip Nintendo’s platform, or rely on ports that are so compromised they can’t be confidently recommended to anyone but the most desperate Switch 2 owner with nowhere else to play.</p> <p>That’s certainly how it felt with games like<em> The Witcher 3</em> and <em>The Outer Worlds</em> on the original Switch. Those were fascinating experiments that reminded you how limited and dated the Switch hardware ultimately still was, at least for anyone working with it who wasn’t Nintendo. I hope we get a few good years on the Switch 2 before it arrives at a similar fate.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[One Of The Creepiest Games Of The Year Is Pure Vibes, No Jump Scares]]></title>
            <link>https://kotaku.com/dreamcore-indie-horror-liminal-backrooms-scary-2000636645</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/one-of-the-creepiest-games-of-the-year-is-pure-vibes-no-jump-scares.1328128/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>If you dig strolling through empty, abandoned places, immersing yourself in some <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Backrooms">backrooms vibes</a>, and enjoying all that’s weird and liminal, then do I have a game to recommend for you. <i>Dreamcore</i> came out in January of this year and it’s a perfectly good time if you love spooky vibes but aren’t too jazzed about screaming monsters and jumpscares.</p>  <p>Developed by Montralulz, <i>Dreamcore</i> is a directionless, HUD-free wandersim that takes you through strange, abandoned levels that almost feel endless. The game intentionally tries to make you feel lost with its lack of clear-cut instructions on what to do. Strange symbols written on walls, seemingly innocuous signs, odd music, and audio cues are the only thing you’re given to figure out where to go and what to do.</p>

 <p>The levels are so massive, in fact, that I’m thinking I might need to keep some graph paper nearby to map out these spaces. I’ve only completed one level thus far, “Dreampools” which is a labyrinth of tiled walls, random pools, and the uncanny use of diffused lighting that often makes those <a href="https://kotaku.com/cyberpunk-2077-graphics-mods-pc-rtx-4090-1851133618">wild <i>Cyberpunk 2077</i> mods</a> or the <a href="https://kotaku.com/better-than-dead-trailer-controversial-bodycam-microprose-2000617981">odd bodycam-footage game</a> look disturbingly close to reality.</p>

 <figure id="attachment_2000636652" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000636652"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000636652">© Screenshot: Montraluz / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p>And though the game has no jumpscares, it’s still plenty capable of freaking you out–especially with some of the odd objects you’ll come across, like a massive smiley-face ball that, while certainly not intimidating, just feels…wrong. Is it watching me?</p>

 <p>With so few things to actually do in these spaces other than walk around, the real challenge here is not losing your mind and staying focused on slowly unraveling where you should go, following what looks interesting in the hope that you’ll find something unique. It reminds me a bit of <i>The Stanley Parable</i>, but with far simpler environments and the narrative elements ripped out. You often have the sense you’re being watched, that maybe someone’s been here before, and that there’s something you <i>should</i> do, but you can’t quite put your finger on it.</p>

 <figure id="attachment_2000636647" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000636647"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000636647">© Screenshot: Montraluz / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p>There are currently three worlds to explore: the aforementioned “Dreampools,” an endless expanse of empty suburban homes and white picket fences in “Eternal Suburbia,” and “Playrooms,” described as “a sequence of spaces inspired by children’s play areas, recreated with an artificial and silent aesthetic.” More levels are on the way.</p> <p>So if the spooky season has you in the mood for exploring some creepy spaces without things screaming in your face, and you like a bit of the avant garde, <i>Dreamcore</i> might just be up your alley.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/13-things-to-know-before-starting-pok%C3%A9mon-legends-z-a.1328125/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><i><span>Pokémon Legends: Z-A </span></i><span>makes some pretty notable changes to the series’ typical formula. Its battles take place in real-time, it makes the Mega Evolution mechanic a cooldown, and it has several different mission types to juggle while you’re catching and training monsters. That means even series veterans are starting from zero on some things, so before you head into Lumiose City, here are a few helpful tips to make the most of your stay at Hotel Z.</span></p> <h2><b>Read up on </b><b><i>Pokémon X</i></b><b> and </b><b><i>Y</i></b><b>’s story</b></h2> <p><i><span>Legends: Z-A </span></i><span>is essentially a direct sequel to 2013’s </span><i><span>X </span></i><span>and </span><i><span>Y</span></i><span>. The entire game takes place in Lumiose City, a Paris-inspired metropolis you pass through in the original 3DS RPGs. There are returning characters and storylines that come up in </span><i><span>Legends: Z-A</span></i><span>’s stories and sidequests, so if you’ve never played through the original Kalos games or haven’t played them in a while, I recommend either reading a summary or watching a recap as a refresher. That way, you’ll know why it’s significant that AZ is running your hotel, or that Emma has a full-time detective job, among other bigger reveals later on.</span></p>

 <figure id="attachment_2000636650" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000636650"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000636650">© The Pokémon Company / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <h2><b>Prepare yourself: This game is handholdy for a while</b></h2> <p><span>Sometimes I wish </span><i><span>Pokémon </span></i><span>games would give me the option to interrupt NPCs with a Ron Swanson </span><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IEhHEOIYgMY"><span>“I know more than you”</span></a><span> when they insist on tutorializing every little thing. Like, aw, you think I don’t know what a Potion is, or that I’m not on a first-name basis with every Nurse Joy from here to Kanto? And</span><i><span>Legends: Z-A</span></i><span>’s tutorial is particularly time-consuming, essentially taking up hours. You’ll be dragged around the city by your companions for several in-game days as you’re taught the ins and outs of everything </span><i><span>Legends: Z-A </span></i><span>has to offer. Your Rotom phone will stop you from venturing too far from the intended path, and it will get very, very frustrating. But when it comes to an end, the rest of the city is open to you right off the bat.</span></p>

 <h2><b>Your moves do different things than you’re used to</b></h2> <p><span>Since </span><i><span>Legends: Z-A </span></i><span>has a real-time battle system, some classic attacks have been tweaked to fit this new setup. For example, buff moves that once affected your Pokémon for a certain number of turns are now calculated in real-time, lasting however many seconds rather than turns. As you teach your party new moves, familiarize yourself with how they work in </span><i><span>Legends: Z-A</span></i><span>, because they might be slightly different than what you’re used to.</span></p>

 <h2><b>Positioning and timing are everything</b></h2> <p><span>When you give your Pokémon commands, they will move to somewhere on the field that puts them in the right spot to execute the attack based on your opponent’s current position. However, if your opponent moves out of the way, the attack will miss. So rather than accuracy being determined by backend dice rolls, you see the attack land or not as you’re executing it. As such, a big part of learning how to best utilize every attack in your arsenal is understanding where you should be standing when you use it, and keeping an eye on your opponent’s maneuvers and cooldowns to make sure it’s timed well. Some enemies know moves like Protect that will shield them from your attacks, but they will be on a cooldown, so if you can bait your opponent into using it on a weaker move, you’ll have an opening for a counterattack.</span></p>

 <figure id="attachment_2000636648" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000636648"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000636648">© The Pokémon Company / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <h2><b>Find attack orders that act as combos</b></h2> <p><span>This new position-based gameplay means that simply attacking at random and cycling through your cooldowns is not always the best play. As you cultivate your Pokémon’s movesets, finding attacks that can synergize together to create combos can help you get the leg up on your opponents. For example, right now, my Pikachu knows Quick Attack, Nuzzle, and Spark. One of my go-to strategies in battles is to have him use Quick Attack to get in close to an enemy, use that closeness to Nuzzle them into a paralyzed state, then use Spark to run out of the fight with a destructive, electric dash. This combo lets Pikachu be a bit of a hit-and-run character that can get in, do some damage, then retreat to safety. Knowing how your moves can work together is just as important as type coverage, and discovering those will take some experimentation.</span></p>

 <h2><b>Stop locking on as a pseudo dodge</b></h2> <p><span>To target enemies on the field, you’ll have to lock onto them with ZL. Doing this will make your active Pokémon square up against whoever you’re looking at, and they’ll stay relatively close to this foe so they’re ready to execute any commands you give them. If you find your partner is getting slapped around and should get out of the scrap, simply stop locking onto an enemy, and your Pokémon will run back to your side. Make sure you’re also out of the way of whatever attack is incoming, too, though.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <h2><b>You can reach any clothing store once you have free rein&nbsp;</b></h2> <p><span>The fashion in </span><i><span>Legends: Z-A </span></i><span>is pretty great. It’s a definite upgrade from </span><i><span>Scarlet </span></i><span>and </span><i><span>Violet</span></i><span>, which forced all of us to wear school uniforms. New fits are expensive, but the game is pretty generous about letting you buy whatever clothes you want pretty quickly. Once you’re able to freely roam Lumiose City, you can reach every store without issue. Make a shopping day of running around the city and trying stuff on. Clothes are no longer gender-locked in </span><i><span>Legends: Z-A</span></i><span>, either, so you can wear whatever you want.&nbsp;</span></p> <figure id="attachment_2000636651" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000636651"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000636651">© The Pokémon Company / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <h2><b>You’ll unlock time skip later</b></h2> <p><i><span>Legends: Z-A </span></i><span>loves to withhold basic functions for several gameplay hours, including a time skip feature that lets you skip to the night of its day/night cycle. You can only engage in trainer battles during the night, and some wild Pokémon only come out when the sun is gone, so there will be times when you wish you could just sit on a bench and wait for nightfall. I can tell you that you will be able to do that eventually, but for the first few hours, you’ll get an in-game warning that it’s not the time to be resting every time you try and sit down. Once you’re able to sit on a bench without someone yelling, you’ll be able to skip to evenings or hang out with your Pokémon friends on the bench and take photos.</span></p> <h2><b>If you haven’t heard already, Shiny Pokémon don’t despawn</b></h2> <p><span>Shiny Pokémon just became a lot easier to capture in </span><i><span>Legends: Z-A</span></i><span>, and it’s because they <a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-legends-z-a-shiny-hunting-despawn-sound-effect-2000636142">no longer despawn</a>. These alternate-colored monsters have a low spawn rate, but in Lumiose City, they’ll stay on the map until you either defeat them or capture them, rather than disappearing as the map refreshes. You can lose a battle, leave a wild zone, or shut the game down entirely, and Shinies will be right where you left them. The hunters have </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-legends-za-shiny-despawn-afk-exploit-wild-zone-2000636610"><span>already been exploiting this</span></a><span>, but even if you’re a casual Shiny collector, this will be helpful to your efforts.</span></p>

 <h2><b>More Wild Zones will open as the game progresses</b></h2> <p><span>Though you can go just about anywhere in Lumiose City early on, you won’t find some of your favorite Pokémon right off the bat. The Wild Zone areas where Pokémon reside will open up as you progress through the story, and later ones will feature monsters you couldn’t find in the early hours. It does mean that popular Pokémon aren’t available until much later, so if you can’t find a specific one, just know that more of these zones will appear as you keep going.</span></p> <figure id="attachment_2000636649" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000636649"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000636649">© The Pokémon Company / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <h2><b>Some story missions pause the day/night cycle</b></h2> <p><span>This isn’t a foolproof rule, but it’s something I noticed when I was running around Lumiose City and hadn’t received any notifications that the sun was getting low and the metropolis would turn into a battle zone. I had been neglecting a story mission that was set to take place during the day to do some side quests; then, when it dawned on me that time hadn’t passed, I realized the game world’s clock had seemingly been frozen until I went to deliver a package to a friend. Sure enough, the sun started setting shortly after I completed the quest. I tested this on a later story mission and noticed the sun was moving as it should, so this isn’t a universal truth. Just keep in mind that sometimes you might need to finish a story mission before the evening will come, or you can use it to your advantage to keep the sun shining while you run some daytime errands.</span></p>

 <h2><b>Photo mode is essentially a first-person mode</b></h2> <p><span>There have been times in </span><i><span>Legends: Z-A </span></i><span>when I’ve wanted to examine some objects in the environment that were a bit far away in the game’s usual third-person camera angle. However, if you open photo mode with the minus button, you’ll shift to a first-person perspective that you can walk around in. This is helpful if you want a closer look at an area </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-legends-za-arceus-lumiose-museum-ingo-hisui-2000636160"><span>or museum display</span></a><span>.&nbsp;</span></p> <h2><b>You can pick up lost Poké Balls from collectors</b></h2> <p><span>Part of Lumiose City’s redevelopment plan is that there are now Poké Ball collectors stationed outside the Pokémon Center. These guys are keeping the city clean by picking up trash and spare Poké Balls that hooligans leave lying around the city. If you throw one of these capturing devices and miss, or a Pokémon breaks out of its hold, these guys will be holding onto them at the Center. Before you go stocking up on Poké Balls, check in with them to see if they have any of your litter on hand. </span></p>
