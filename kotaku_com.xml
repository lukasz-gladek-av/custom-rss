              <p>Swen Vincke, the director of the massively popular and <a href="https://kotaku.com/baldurs-gate-3-bg3-review-dungeons-dragons-rpg-larian-1850726491">successful RPG</a><em> Baldur’s Gate 3,</em> recently teased Larian Studios’ next big game on social media while celebrating the fact that it has been two years since the team’s <em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons</em>-themed game left early access and became a global phenomenon.</p> <p>On August 3, a content creator on Twitter shared the news that it had now been exactly two years since <em>Baldur’s Gate 3</em> left early access on Steam and was fully released to the world. The turn-based RPG quickly became one of the biggest games of 2023 thanks to its incredible depth, wonderful writing, and its numerous, memorable romance options.<em> Baldur’s Gate 3</em> ended up winning so many awards after its launch that it <a href="https://kotaku.com/baldurs-gate-3-too-many-awards-winning-larian-goty-1851593323">started causing problems for developer Larian Studios</a>. Now, two years later, Vincke shared that tweet announcing the anniversary and <a href="https://x.com/LarAtLarian/status/1952106606864253253?t=6umojy2gp7HUKigWoKWTU">called <em>Baldur’s Gate 3 “</em>life changing”</a> while teasing the studio’s next big project, which he claims is only possible thanks to<em> BG3</em>‘s success.</p> <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">Crazy to think it’s only been two years. It’s truly been life changing. Probably worth writing about one day. But I can spoil the biggest takeaway.  BG3 was what allowed us to do our next crazy thing. How that will pan out is anyone’s guess but I can assure you we’re working hard… <a href="https://t.co/bGBYZoSXGZ">https://t.co/bGBYZoSXGZ</a></p> <p>— Swen Vincke @where? (@LarAtLarian) <a href="https://twitter.com/LarAtLarian/status/1952106606864253253?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">August 3, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <p>“Crazy to think it’s only been two years. It’s truly been life changing,” said Vincke on Twitter. “Probably worth writing about one day. But I can spoil the biggest takeaway. <em>BG3</em> was what allowed us to do our next crazy thing. How that will pan out is anyone’s guess, but I can assure you we’re working hard to ensure you’ll have plenty of fun. Like really – loads of it. In a surprising way. And I can’t wait to show you. But you’ll need to be patient.”</p>

 <p>This isn’t the first time Vincke has teased a big, new, ambitious game that isn’t<em> Baldur’s Gate 4</em>. <a href="https://kotaku.com/baldur-s-gate-3-sequel-expansion-larian-studios-1851356964">In March 2024</a>, while talking at GDC, Vincke confirmed that Larian wasn’t working on an expansion for <em>BG3</em>, nor was the studio developing a sequel. Instead, he confirmed that it was working on two new games based on original IP. At the time, the CEO and <em>BG3</em> director claimed both games were still in the very early stages of development. <a href="https://kotaku.com/baldurs-gate-3-larian-new-next-game-ip-divinity-rpg-1851419091">The next month</a>, Vincke once again teased the studio’s next game, this time as a part of a blog about a <em>BG3</em> update on Steam.</p> <p>“I don’t know if we’re going to pull it off, but looking at our narrative, visual, and gameplay plans, I think what we’re working on now will be our best work ever,” Vincke said in the 2024 post. “I get excited like a kid watching the key imagery, want to show it to everyone now, and grumble in frustration at having to wait until it’s actually all working. Yes, it’s hype, but it’s hype because it really looks and feels good.”</p> <p>So yeah, whatever Larian Studios is working on right now sounds massive and impressive, and is likely years away. In Vincke’s post on Monday, he ended it with: “We’ll need a bit of time to make it all work. It’ll be worth it though.”</p>

              <p>The thing I love most about Evo is you can turn on any of the tournaments at any moment and instantly feel the tension, hope, and despair with every combo, counter, and unexpected reversal of fortune. <a href="https://kotaku.com/meet-the-guy-keeping-x-men-vs-street-fighter-alive-at-evo-2025-2000614410">Evo 2025 is over now</a>, but it left us with plenty of great matches (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fCdhFfH85a8">the highlight for me was the T<em>ekken</em> top 8</a>) and lots of new fighting game announcements.

The next entry in the series is being developed by <em>Yakuza</em> maker Ryu Ga Gotoku Studio and fans can expect more info out of Tokyo Game Show this fall. <a href="https://x.com/GamesCage_/status/1952149691736760393">People are hyped</a>.

The introverted protagonist will be available starting August 21, while season 2 of the show isn’t expected to become available until late next year or early 2027.

Ken is available now, with Chun-Li joining sometime over the winter. It’s the follow-up to a crossover exchange that began with Terry Bogard and Mai Shiranui coming to <em>Street Fighter 6&nbsp;</em>last year. The game itself has some strong fundamentals but is extremely content-light and hard to recommend with so much stronger competition around.</p>

              <p>Electronic Arts and Battlefield Studios—a team made up of four EA-owned studios—are focused on making sure the upcoming military shooter <a href="https://kotaku.com/battlefield-6-preview-destruction-classes-bf3-bf4-1851787384"><em>Battlefield</em> 6</a> is extremely well-optimized, with the developers claiming the game will run on all consoles and platforms at 60FPS or more.</p> <p>Last week, <a href="https://kotaku.com/battlefield-6-preview-destruction-classes-bf3-bf4-1851787384">EA revealed <em>Battlefield 6</em>‘s multiplayer in a big event in Los Angeles</a>. A large group of journalists (myself included) and content creators were invited there and got to play over four hours of <em>BF6</em>. The game reminds me a lot of <em>Battlefield 3</em> and <em>Battlefield 4,</em> and that’s not by accident. The team of studios working on the FPS is specifically trying to create a new <em>Battlefield</em> game that harkens back to those more grounded and contemporary military shooters that were both fan favorites. From what I’ve played so far, they’ve nailed it. And another thing that I can confirm EA and Battlefield Studios have nailed is the game’s performance, which ran perfectly during my preview. That’s not shocking considering how hard the devs are working to ensure<em> Battlefield 6</em> runs well on all platforms.</p> <p><a href="https://www.tweaktown.com/news/106788/battlefield-6-on-ps5-60fps-fidelity-mode-90fps-performance-120fps-pro/index.html">As spotted by <em>TweakTown</em></a>, in a recent interview with <em>Battlefield 6</em>‘s principal game designer Florian Le Biha during the LA event, <a href="https://youtu.be/m2VK2fCG3HI?t=78">YouTuber Tech &amp; Co asked about the game’s&nbsp;performance and optimization</a> and Le Biha confirmed that it will run at a minimum of 60FPS on all consoles and PC.</p>

 <p>“Well, optimization for us has been one of the most important things for [<em>Battlefield 6</em>],” said Le Biha. “We want to make sure that it’s not just a game that looks graphically super beautiful, but it’s also a game that runs on all configurations, whether it’s on PC or on all Xbox or PS5 [consoles] of this generation. So we put a lot of effort into optimizing the game. We guarantee 60FPS on all experiences on consoles, [higher framerates] on PC, obviously, and even more on consoles [which support] performance mode, which allows you to go even higher.”</p> <p>As further reported by <em>TweakTown</em>, a player who says they are involved in <em>BF6</em>‘s extensive early access playtesting program, known as BFLabs, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Battlefield/comments/1mesy9p/battlefield_6_pc_console_performance/">claims on Reddit</a> that the upcoming milsim targets 80FPS in performance mode on PlayStation 5 and also suggested that the PS5 Pro version of the game will hit 120FPS. They also explained that the Xbox Series S doesn’t have a performance mode, but still hits 60FPS, which lines up with what Le Biha told Tech &amp; Co.</p> <p>I can personally confirm that when I played <em>Battlefield 6</em> on PS5 at a party hosted by EA after the event, the game ran extremely well, looking like at least a stable and locked 60 FPS with no noticeable drops. On PC, when I played the game during the event, it ran at over 120FPS and felt buttery smooth. Of course, things could change when the game arrives in October or when people go hands-on later this month <a href="https://kotaku.com/ea-battlefield-6-open-beta-nyc-teaser-trailer-gameplay-1851786700">during <em>BF6</em>‘s open beta.</a> But it does indeed seem like the devs are focused on making sure BF6 is super well-optimized on all platforms, even the Xbox Series S.</p>
