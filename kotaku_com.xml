The non-profit organization has been working on it since 2017, collecting development documents, behind-the-scenes content, and rare video game magazines. And now, after a lot of hard work, VGHF’s library is open to the public and it’s awesome. </p><p>With the new <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://library.gamehistory.org/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://library.gamehistory.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">VGHF library</a></span>, you can dig through over 1500 issues of old video game magazines, including popular ones like <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://archive.gamehistory.org/folder/9a193e8c-67e0-45ff-98d2-a33e85721cc4&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://archive.gamehistory.org/folder/9a193e8c-67e0-45ff-98d2-a33e85721cc4" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>EGM, Game Informer, </em>and<em> Gamepro</em> as well as less well-known publications like <em>Girl Gamer </em>and <em>Digital Diner</em></a></span>. </p><p>Not only can you flip through these magazines for free on your PC, but you can also search through all of them using keyword searches and filter your results. Want to look up a particular game and see old stories about it? You can do that! Want to check out stories on an industry icon? Just search their name. You can even filter out years and types of content to get really specific. It’s a powerful tool that will help researchers and historians for years to come. </p><p>“Our library is the future home for all our collections,” said VGHF’s Library Director Phil Salvador. “We’re in this for the long-haul, and over the coming years, we’ll be adding even more materials to our archive and adding new features to our library system.

We own almost all of them, and when we don’t, we have a custodial record of who does.”</p><p> If you want to help the VGHF continue this awesome work, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://gamehistory.org/donate/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://gamehistory.org/donate/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">you can donate money to them using this website.</a></span> And you should, because video game history is important and there aren’t many people out there doing the hard work to preserve it like the VGHF. </p><p> .<br></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

If it’s not going to be the feature-rich narrative sequel we were promised, I do hope that Blizzard can at least find something to bring the magic back. The team is no doubt aware that <em>Marvel Rivals </em>hangs over <em>Overwatch 2</em>. Every perceived misstep right now might feel like a point on the board for NetEase, and every underwhelming update or recolored skin looks like <em>Overwatch 2 </em>falling further behind.</p><p>I don’t know that a new PvP mode is the update <em>Overwatch 2 </em>needs to get back on top. Returning to the 6v6 format won’t wipe away the stench people associate with the game overnight,  and after gutting <em>Overwatch 2 </em>into a husk of its former self, Blizzard has to know the window to reclaim its place in the hierarchy of hero shooters is closing. The faded glow of its long-gone status as undisputed king has largely sustained <em>Overwatch 2 </em>through years of content droughts and failure to live up to its potential. In the volatile live-service market, you can only stay in the shadow of something else for so long before players stop searching for you on their desktops. I hope <em>Overwatch 2 </em>can find a way out of the darkness it’s found itself in.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

And despite obviously being a knock-off <em>Mario Strikers</em> game, over two weeks later, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/mariostro-strikers-soccer-league/9nkkvwjd69wh&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/mariostro-strikers-soccer-league/9nkkvwjd69wh" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">it is still available to purchase and play on Xbox</a></span> for the low, low price of $4. I’d include a trailer below, but I can’t find one. I also can’t find any video on YouTube of someone playing this game. So instead, here’s a screenshot of the game via its store page:</p><figure id="" data-id="025bc08359e90c51e72b44d4bab3511e" data-recommend-id="image://025bc08359e90c51e72b44d4bab3511e" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Lighthousegamess / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="025bc08359e90c51e72b44d4bab3511e" data-recommend-id="image://025bc08359e90c51e72b44d4bab3511e" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Yikes! That don’t look great. And here’s the game’s actual description from its Xbox store page. See if you notice anything that shouldn’t be in there.</p><blockquote data-type="BlockQuote"><p>Dive into the thrilling world of arcade-style soccer with [Your Game Name Here]! Experience the excitement of 4v4 matches, where every player counts. With 10 unique and fun teams to choose from, you’ll dribble, pass, and shoot your way to victory while defending your goal with a skilled goalkeeper. </p></blockquote><p>Also, in the game’s store page, it mentions that it supports “4v4 matches” and that <em>Mariostro Strikers </em>is perfect for “challenging your friends.” But the game is listed as single-player title. I’d spend money to figure out what’s going on but I have so many other things I’d rather do with my time.</p><p> Something I could do instead of buying and playing <em>Mariostro Strikers</em>? Well how about simply zooming in on different parts of the <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.53125.13659343925286474.928fcfc6-0d14-4ec3-a1a4-4e5e4da221da.29dceb49-a2d7-4aec-a7e7-b912c57e610a?q=90&amp;w=3840&amp;h=2160&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.53125.13659343925286474.928fcfc6-0d14-4ec3-a1a4-4e5e4da221da.29dceb49-a2d7-4aec-a7e7-b912c57e610a?q=90&amp;w=3840&amp;h=2160" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">AI-generated cover art</a></span> for the game and laughing at everything I find. That’s free and a lot of fun. For example, look at this shit: </p><figure id="" data-id="2777054152624db0d194ca670b89858f" data-recommend-id="image://2777054152624db0d194ca670b89858f" data-format="png" data-width="250" data-height="285" data-lightbox="true" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Lighthousegamess / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="2777054152624db0d194ca670b89858f" data-recommend-id="image://2777054152624db0d194ca670b89858f" data-format="png" data-width="250" data-height="285" data-lightbox="true" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Anyway, I’ve reached out to Xbox about this and asked if the company is going to remove it anytime soon or if it was even aware of it. I’m also curious if Xbox will change anything to stop these knock-offs from appearing. Remember that time in <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/god-of-war-war-gods-xbox-indie-knock-off-kratos-1849361788&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/god-of-war-war-gods-xbox-indie-knock-off-kratos-1849361788">2022 when a<em> God of War </em>clone appeared on the Xbox store</a></span>? That eventually got pulled, but only after the internet found it and joked about it for a few days. </p><p>  <em>Mariostro Strikers: Soccer League</em> is out now on Xbox. I’d uh, not buy it, but hey, I’m not your dad. So do whatever you want. Waste your money. I don’t care!</p><p> .<br></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
