Once you’ve done that, you’re taken to an area made up of five challenging platform sections filled with deadly red lasers. This area has become known as “Laser Hell” and is extremely hard to complete as you have to finish all five sections without either player dying. </p><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.gamesradar.com/games/co-op/split-fiction-players-defeat-secret-challenge-so-tough-that-some-of-the-devs-themselves-can-barely-complete-it-and-get-rewarded-with-the-promise-of-an-early-peek-at-the-directors-next-game/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/co-op/split-fiction-players-defeat-secret-challenge-so-tough-that-some-of-the-devs-themselves-can-barely-complete-it-and-get-rewarded-with-the-promise-of-an-early-peek-at-the-directors-next-game/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">As spotted by <em>Gamesradar</em></a></span>, on March 17 two speedrunners from China— “sharkOvO” and “E1uM4y”—<span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1ExXuYaE7E/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1ExXuYaE7E/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">recorded themselves beating Laser Hell</a></span>.

Took us a lot of time to finish it. And I’m telling you, this is a crazy, crazy achievement that you have done.”</p><p>Fares then dunks on people like us watching the Easter egg video on YouTube before offering the first people to complete this level a very cool prize.</p><p>“I’m going to tell you one thing: If you see me in real life, somewhere, and you can prove to me that you actually did this challenge, I can promise you the first one that does that, I’m going to fly you to Sweden and show you early footage of our next game,” Fares promises with a smile. “I promise you that. And then show you some other surprises as well.” </p><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://x.com/josef_fares/status/1902355744751514068&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://x.com/josef_fares/status/1902355744751514068" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">And on March 19, Fares tweeted</a></span> that “sharkOvO” and “E1uM4y” had seemingly proved to the director that they pulled it off and had earned a flight to Sweden. </p><p>“Congrats to ‘sharkOvO’ and ‘E1uM4y’ for finishing the secret challenge ‘Laser Hell’ in <em>Split Fiction</em>,” tweeted Fares. “VERY impressive! I will keep my promise and invite you both to Sweden for an early look of our next game. We´ll be in touch!” </p><p>I doubt they’ll be able to say anything about what they see, but hopefully the duo have a good time checking out Hazelight’s next project. </p><p> .<br></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

However, it looks like the publication is gearing up for a return based on posts on its social media channels.</p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="197298" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="Live Forever in the Universe of 'New World: Aeternum'" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="108" data-playlist="197298,197284,197260" data-current="197298"><div><p>Live Forever in the Universe of 'New World: Aeternum'</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197298/197298_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197298/197298_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197298/197298_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197298/197298_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"></video></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>The magazine’s Twitter, Bluesky, Instagram, and YouTube channels have all been revived and now feature a teaser video of a laptop screen displaying the goodbye message that has been sitting on the <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.gameinformer.com/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.gameinformer.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>Game Informer </em>website</a></span> since it shut down in August. That message was notably not written by any of the staff members and was the only thing you could see on the website for the past seven months after GameStop wiped the publication’s online archive. But in the teaser, the screen glitches out, and the text “{CONSOLE.WRITELINE (CONTINUE?);” appears on the bottom right corner. It ends with a date, March 25, 2025, teasing some kind of announcement next week.</p><p>After the teaser went live, several members of <em>Game Informer</em>’s staff at the time of the shutdown have posted similar teasers on their personal social media accounts, including <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://bsky.app/profile/brianpshea.bsky.social/post/3lkqlak7tik2i&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://bsky.app/profile/brianpshea.bsky.social/post/3lkqlak7tik2i" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">ex-content director Brian Shea</a></span> and <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://bsky.app/profile/matthewmiller.bsky.social/post/3lkql376uq22k&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://bsky.app/profile/matthewmiller.bsky.social/post/3lkql376uq22k" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">former editor-in-chief Matt Miller</a></span>. So if you were worried that GameStop had revived <em>Game Informer </em>as some kind of AI slop machine, take heart: it looks like some of the people who were working at the site before its shutdown are involved.</p><p><em>Game Informer</em>’s closure in August was <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/game-informer-magazine-shutting-down-closed-react-staff-1851611950&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/game-informer-magazine-shutting-down-closed-react-staff-1851611950">a brutal blow not only to the games media landscape</a></span> but to video game history, as the publication had provided a window into the work of many beloved developers and the evolution of many popular franchises throughout its 33-year run. If the site is coming back, hopefully the archives are as well. </p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
