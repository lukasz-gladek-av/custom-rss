              <p>It’s quite the pickle. You’ve got a well-loved 2016 indie hit, and you figured it’d be nice to make it free on Steam for a bit. But then, a good while later, you decide it’s time to give it a graphical overhaul, update it with a whole new online multiplayer mode, and start charging a little bit for all that work. Except, nope. It seems there’s a limit for how many times you can switch your game from free to paid. So, as <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/beloved-co-operative-platformer-pico-park-classic-edition-has-been-accidentally-made-free-on-steam-forever">spotted by&nbsp;<em>Eurogamer</em></a>, Tecopark’s <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/461040/PICO_PARKClassic_Edition/"><em>Pico Park: Classic Edition</em></a> and its new multiplayer mode is stuck at free, and will always be.</p> <p>Japanese developer Tecopark’s&nbsp;<em>Pico Park</em> games have proven hugely popular multiplayer games over the last ten years. Alongside the&nbsp;<em>Classic</em> version, there’s 2021’s re-imagined&nbsp;<em>Pico Park</em>, and most recently 2024’s&nbsp;<em>Pico Park 2</em>. They’re all cooperative puzzle games for between two and eight players, in which you’re challenged to collect a level’s keys via collaborative platform action. As you might imagine, this can become chaotic extremely quickly as groups attempt to arrange their cute cat-like characters into stacked piles to reach platforms, or assign themselves to pressing multiple buttons at once to open doors. And in the <em>Classic</em> version, that madness could go up to as many as 10 players. Albeit, until recently, only in local multiplayer.</p>

 <p>Tecopark’s Shunsuke Miyake posted to the game’s Updates page on August 20, “I’m thinking of updating&nbsp;<em>Classic Edition</em> for the first time in nine years… Since I’m doing it anyway, I’ll update it with online support.” He added, “<wbr>I might charge a small fee for it. I recommend installing it while it’s still free.”</p>

 <p>Come September 13, that update had happened, and the game now had art that matches its two sequels, ran on monitors running over 60Hz, added Steam inputs, and most significantly, now included online multiplayer. Miyake added, “We’ll keep it free for about a week.” Which was pretty generous!</p>

 <p>Then this last weekend, a new update appeared. The title is “<em>PICO PARK&nbsp;: Classic Edition</em> is permanently free!” with the text explaining this change.</p> <blockquote><p>“I was planning to switch to a paid plan after updating the online support, but I forgot that once you switch from paid to free, I can never go back to paid! : )”</p></blockquote> <p>He then adds, “If you enjoy playing this free version, be sure to try the series (<em>PICO PARK</em>, <em>PICO PARK 2</em>) too.”</p>

 <p>The 2021 version of <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1509960/PICO_PARK/"><em>Pico Park</em></a> was an updated port of the Switch’s 2019 game (keep notes, there’s a test at the end), with all-new levels and online multiplayer, along with a bunch of new modes and ways to play. It even lets you use your phone as a controller for party gaming around one screen, rather than forcing you into the hassle of hooking up eight Xbox controllers at once.</p>

 <p>Last September’s&nbsp;<a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2644470/PICO_PARK_2/"><em>Pico Park 2</em></a> offered a brand new set of levels, along with all the previous features, including cross-platform support. Both games are extremely well received, eliciting very creative Steam reviews from people broken by their experiences. “This is the game where friendships go to DIE,” says one positive review. Another says, “this game ruined my relationships with all my friends and I am now left alone. Great game.” My personal favorite reads, “You get to see who’s stupid among your friends, then realize it was you all along.”</p> <p>And now, it seems, you can experience the original version of all this in its prettier glory, and online, for free! Poor ol’ Tecopark. For real, go buy a sequel if you enjoy it! Poor people just wanted to make a well-earned buck. Honestly, they should add it as a free game on Itch.io too, where at least people can then choose to pay for it if they want to.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Roborock has built its reputation as the premium brand in robot vacuums but that prestige comes with a price tag. Most of their newer models sail past the $1,000 mark and puts serious automated cleaning out of reach for many households. The <strong>Qrevo QV 35A</strong> breaks that pattern as one of Roborock’s more accessible options, especially during Amazon’s<em> Prime Big Deal Days</em> <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4636/">where it’s dropped to $399, down from $649</a>. This <strong>Prime-exclusive deal expires tonight</strong> and gives you limited time to snag a high-end robot vacuum and mop combo.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4636/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<p>The 8,000Pa sucking power places this unit in the high-end level of cleaning power that is robust enough that it <strong>can suck out ground-in dirt from carpet fibers and snatch up debris from hardwood grout lines</strong>. Most entry-level bot vacs hover around the 3,000-4,000Pa level so this unit provides almost triple the force, which makes a major difference on carpets or homes with pets that continuously shed. The <strong>new-generation anti-tangle brushes</strong> resolve one of the pain points with owning a robot vacuum by eliminating the tendency for the brush bar to wrap around with hairs.</p>
<h2>The All-in-One Dock Does the Dirty Work</h2>
<p>The real value comes from the <strong>all-in-one docking station that handles mop washing automatically</strong>. After cleaning, the robot returns to its dock where the station washes the dual spinning mops with clean water, and removes the grime they’ve picked up. This means you’re not dragging dirty mops across your floors on subsequent cleaning sessions. The mops spin at 200 RPM and creates mechanical scrubbing action that tackles stuck-on spills and stains rather than just wiping moisture around.</p>
<p>The <strong>self-emptying dustbin is what makes the system hands-off</strong>, really. The dock self-sucks messes out of the internal dustbin on the robot into a larger bag back at the base station. You <strong>can abandon the vacuum for weeks on end</strong> as the base can accommodate as much as seven weeks’ worth of accumulated dirt and dust, depending on the size of your home and mess level. Dump the bag every month or every two months instead of dealing with a small dustbin after every cleaning pass.</p>



<p>What’s more, <strong>intelligent collision avoidance employs sensors and AI detection</strong> to steer around typical floor hazards such as shoes, wires, pet toys or unexpected spills. It illustrates the layout of your home during initial uses, and becomes familiar with the best cleaning paths and retaining room boundaries. No-go areas can be designated via the app which can be programmed to schedule varying cleaning modes per room or time of day.</p>
<p>The mop function provides real added value beyond ordinary vacuuming: The water tank maintains a stable moisture level on the spinning mops, appropriate for sealed hardwood, tile, laminate, or vinyl flooring. Water flow can be varied as appropriate to floor type or how grimy your floors become on average. Vacuum-then-mop, all in one automated pass, saves the time that would be taken on separate passages.</p>
<p>This Roborock at $399 comes with features that would be common on $800-1,000 units from the same company. Just the all-in-one dock would be a few hundred as a separate accessory on lower-end bots. This is the <strong>Prime-member deal that ends tonight</strong>, so grab yours before the price goes back up.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/lego-clears-out-harry-potter-stock-hagrids-hut-selling-for-mere-pennies-2000633202</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/lego-clears-out-harry-potter-stock-hagrid%E2%80%99s-hut-selling-for-mere-pennies.1319755/</guid>

              <p>Here’s something that doesn’t happen often: a LEGO Harry Potter set on sale. These sets are among the most popular in the entire LEGO catalog and discounts are rare. When you find one with stellar reviews like this <strong>Hagrid’s Hut set</strong> (which boasts an impressive 4.9 out of 5 stars), it’s even more unusual.</p>
<p>Right now, during the final hours of Prime Big Deal Day, <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4642/">this popular set has dropped to $41 on Amazon, down from $74 (44% off) which marks an all-time low price</a>. This<strong> deal is exclusively for Prime members</strong>, and there’s no guarantee it’ll return before the holidays roll around.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4642/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<p>Hagrid’s Hut is one of the most emotive locations in the Wizarding World, the site of Harry’s initial revelations about his magical parentage and the setting of many indelible scenes across the series. For collectors and fans, recreating these scenes is one way that the magic can be brought home in tangible form. This is a masterful capture of the barely-tamed feel of Hagrid’s mountain hut with incredible attention to every little detail.</p>
<h2>Seven Characters and a Dragon Bring the Scene to Life</h2>
<p>The real magic is the character list. You get the complete roster of <strong>seven characters: Harry Potter, Hermione Granger, Ron Weasley, Draco Malfoy, and Rubeus Hagrid as mini-figures</strong>, plus LEGO interpretations of Norbert,<strong> the baby dragon, and Fang, the loyal boarhound of Hagrid</strong>. With these, kids can reproduce the iconic scene in The Philosopher’s Stone when Harry and his pals discover Hagrid openly incubating a dragon’s egg in secret.</p>



<p>The hut itself is a happy size for play and has beautifully considered design elements that make the building experience all the more fun. It’s easy to access the inside without becoming frustrated <strong>thanks to the removable roof</strong> and the building opens wide to show the detailed interior. Hagrid’s trademark oversized furniture consists of his foldout chair that are beautifully proportioned to his half-giant frame. There is an umbrella stand on which his noted pink umbrella (which actually contains his broken wand) would sit, and the key dragon egg element waits to crack open. <strong>Fang’s doghouse sits separate</strong>&nbsp;and provides depth to the scene as well as the possibility of play scenarios outdoors.</p>



<p>One particularly nice touch is the random inclusion of <strong>two gold-plated portrait elements</strong>: They are among a group of 14 collectible Hogwarts portraits that extend across multiple LEGO Harry Potter sets.</p>
<p>The <strong>collection is made up of 465 pieces</strong> and offers multiple hours of fun building time suitable for children aged 8 and above. Complexity falls just in that golden zone between challenging enough that it is rewarding without being tough enough that little builders get stuck.</p>
<p>At this all-time low price, you’re getting incredible value. Those seven characters, two buildings, and the collectible portrait pieces individually would easily merit the whole $74 price. For parents searching for a Halloween special, birthday, or early holiday gift, the deal is the best chance this year to acquire this specific set without breaking the budget.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><span>Yesterday, Nintendo released an animated short called </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/nintendo-animated-close-to-you-mario-pikmin-theory-2000632576"><span>“Close to You”</span></a><span> on its YouTube and social media channels. The video was posted with no context, no description, and even its comments were turned off, so no one could speculate about its meaning in the comments. Today, Nintendo uploaded an updated version of the short on the Nintendo Today app that sheds some light on the mystery by revealing Pikmin, the titular little plant-like creatures from Nintendo’s strategy game series, were behind the original video’s shenanigans all along.</span></p> <p><span>Some fans clocked this yesterday, as the video had some </span><i><span>Pikmin </span></i><span>musical motifs in its score, and it looked like one of these plant guys was carrying items in the background of one shot. But there was also a fair bit of </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/nintendo-just-shared-a-4-minute-pixar-like-animated-short-with-no-explanation-2000632524"><span>speculation that it could have been a clip from the upcoming </span><i><span>Super Mario Galaxy Movie</span></i></a><span>, depicting what could have been a baby Rosalina taking her first steps. But now we know for sure, because the updated video shows all the weird floating items in the baby’s room were actually being moved by Pikmin the whole time. The video hasn’t been uploaded outside of the Nintendo Today app at the moment, but the updated version is almost exactly the same, but it’s like someone flipped a switch and enabled a whole other layer in the rendering process, showing dozens of Pikmin crawling around the baby’s room. We’ll update this story when the video is uploaded on YouTube or any platform we can actually embed.</span></p> <p><span>The question remains, however: what is this teasing? Is it a new </span><i><span>Pikmin </span></i><span>game? A movie? The return of the </span><a href="https://pikmin.nintendo.com/en/short-movies/"><i><span>Pikmin </span></i><span>short movies</span></a><span>? Maybe we’ll find out more tomorrow if a third version drops? Or maybe it’s just a fun one-off thing some animators wanted to put together? Whatever the case, it’s a cute short. I hope to be able to watch it on something other than my phone before the day’s end.</span></p>
