              <p>Home security used to mean signing expensive contracts with professional monitoring companies, paying installation fees and dealing with clunky equipment bolted to your walls. Ring changed that equation entirely by putting professional-grade security into a DIY package that anyone can install in an afternoon: The Ring Alarm 14-piece kit gives you comprehensive <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4931/">coverage for a typical 2 to 4 bedroom home, and right now it’s down to just $198 on Amazon, slashed from its regular $329 price</a> (40% off). This is an all-time low for a complete system that would cost you thousands in installation fees and monthly contracts with traditional security companies.</p>

<h2>What You Need for Full House Coverage</h2>
<p>This 14-piece system comes fully equipped with everything you’ll need to construct a strong security network all the way through your home. You <strong>get one base station, the system’s central brain, which connects all of your sensors</strong> and communicates through your smartphone via your home Wi-Fi network. Two keypads allow you to arm and disarm the system from two locations which is absolutely convenient where you have entries on different floors or want one on the bedroom for nighttime arming.</p>
<p>Eight contact sensors cover your doors and windows and they sense the exact moment the door or window gets opened. Two motion detectors provide extra security by detecting movement inside your home, catching burglars who would go around the entryways. You get a range extender so your signal gets through every corner of your home, even though your home has solid construction or your sensors are significantly far from the base station.</p>



<p>The contact sensor are simple but effective devices that mount in seconds using adhesive strips, avoiding any need for drilling or wiring. Each sensor has two parts: one attaches to the door or window frame, the other to the moving part. A magnetic connection keeps them talking to each other, and the moment that connection breaks because a door opens, the alarm triggers.</p>
<p>Motion detectors cover larger spaces like hallways, living rooms or basements: They use passive infrared technology to detect heat signatures from moving bodies, giving you interior protection even if someone manages to enter without triggering a contact sensor. The detection angle is wide enough to monitor an entire room from a corner mount, and they’re smart enough to distinguish between your pet cat and an actual person, reducing false alarms.</p>



<p>You get <strong>automatic cell phone notifications the second any sensor activates through the Ring app</strong>. You’ll be able to disarm and arm the system from your computer, view the status of the individual sensors, and view your security history to know definitively when doors opened or motion occurred. The app interface is intuitive and responsive, providing you total command anywhere you have cell reception.</p>
<p>It <strong>works seamlessly with Alexa</strong>&nbsp;so you are able to arm or disarm by issuing commands through any Echo device using your voice. Simple commands such as “Alexa, arm Ring Alarm in away mode” handle the whole procedure all by themselves. This <strong>voice integration becomes second nature soon</strong>&nbsp;whenever your grocery-stuffed hands are full or you are going to bed.</p>
<p>At $198 for complete coverage of a multi-bedroom home, this beats the economics of traditional security systems by a landslide.</p>

              <p>Power outages, camping trips or simply wanting energy independence at home all share one common need: reliable portable power that doesn’t tie you to the grid. The Jackery Explorer 1000 solves this problem beautifully and right now Amazon is offering an incredible deal that changes the game entirely: The power station normally retails for $799 on its own, but <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4930/">Amazon has slashed it down to $699 and is throwing in two 100W solar panels completely free</a>. That <strong>bundle would typically cost you $1,299, meaning you’re saving a massive $600 on this package</strong>.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4930/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Why Is This Generation Station Different From Others?</h2>
<p>The Explorer 1000 represents a major upgrade from Jackery previous products: LiFePO4 battery chemistry on this item produces <strong>4,000 charge cycles and yet delivers 70% of original capacity</strong>&nbsp;or roughly 10 years of typical use. Compare this to previous lithium-ion products, which eventually start to fade even after 500 to 800 cycles, and you’ll understand why this style of battery chemistry is rapidly becoming the industry standard for heavy-duty portable power use. That long life translates to your purchase today still keeping your gear powered 10 years later.</p>
<p>The 1,070Wh capacity provides you with extensive runtime on multiple devices: You’ll be able to power a full-size refrigerator for approximately 10 hours, charge a laptop approximately 10 times or power a portable AC unit for several hours through a hot summer power outage. The <strong>unit supplies clean 1,500W of uninterruptible AC power continuously</strong> through three pure sine wave outlets, and <strong>3,000W of surge to power appliances</strong> and devices with high startup surges like power tools or air compressor appliances. Pure sine wave output is essential because it emulates the power you get from your household outlet, and it prevents the damage of computer equipment and new appliances.</p>



<p>The charge rate on this unit is absolutely stellar: Plug into any standard household outlet and you’ll be <strong>topped off 100% within the hou</strong>r thanks to the advanced ChargeShield 2.0 technology. That’s 7.5 times the charge rate of the original Explorer 1000 (v1) model and makes all the difference should you need to recharge rapidly between uses. Two 100W included solar panels recharge the unit 100% within 6 to 8 hours of favorable sunlight, giving you 100% fully off-grid power generation. These collapsible panels are compact and lightweight enough to bring along on any adventure and rugged enough to handle the elements.</p>
<p>Port selection keeps all your current charging demands met, thanks to <strong>three AC plugs, two 100W USB-C ports for fast laptop and tablet charging, one USB-A, and 12V auto port for accessories</strong>. That 100W USB-C outlet is strong enough to charge through a MacBook Pro full speed without the use of any of those big power adapters. You’ll be<strong> able to charge six gadgets all at once</strong>&nbsp;and this makes it ideal for camping excursions with the family or even as an emergency power hub.</p>



<p><strong>Weighing only 23.8 pounds</strong>, this power station remains light even though it packs a big punch. Its ergonomic handle ensures it can be conveniently moved from your automobile to your campsite or down the storm cellar. Its compact size won’t hog your valuable trunk space on long car rides or dominate your storage closet inside the house.</p>
<p>At $699 with two solar panels included, you’re getting emergency preparedness, camping power and energy independence for less than many standalone power stations cost without any solar capability.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/lego-droideka-model-is-selling-for-pennies-star-wars-droid-figure-has-never-been-this-cheap-2000638337</link>

              <p>If you’ve ever watched Star Wars and found yourself mesmerized by those rolling, shield-generating battle droids that gave the Jedi such a hard time, you’re definitely not alone. The <strong>Droideka</strong> has always been one of the most visually striking droids in the entire saga with its menacing tripod stance and devastating firepower.</p>
<p>Now LEGO brings this iconic destroyer droid to life in a way that lets you display it proudly on your desk or shelf. And here’s the kicker: <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4929/">this premium collectible is currently down to just $48 on Amazon, slashed from its original $64 price tag</a>. This is the first time this set has gone on sale since its release, and with a stellar 4.9 out of 5 star rating, it might run out of stock quickly.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4929/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Why should you pay attention to this Droideka?</h2>
<p>The LEGO Star Wars Droideka brings interactivity to your collection with <strong>movable arms that replicate the realistic shooting motion</strong> these droids are famous for in <em>The Phantom Menace </em>and<em> The Clone Wars</em>. You can pose it in full attack mode, arms extended and ready to unleash a barrage of blaster fire or you can fold it into its iconic ball configuration for that classic rolling transport mode.</p>



<p>The construction of the build itself is very rewarding for the adult constructor looking for something interesting but not intimidating. Articulation points are well-crafted and provide solid movement within the arm joints without the flimsiness or looseness. You are able to remove and reattach the legs easily which makes the wheel transformation seamless and natural.</p>
<p>Apart from the actual main Droideka model, the set comes with thoughtful additional pieces to make it go beyond just an ordinary build and become an actual display item. You receive your<strong> own exclusive stand</strong> along with an information plaque to provide context of the Droideka within Star Wars history. You also get a <strong>special Lego Star Wars 25th-anniversary brick</strong> to commemorate a quarter century of the popular sets. For good measure, the set even comes with your own buildable, but smaller, Droideka model to sit atop the display stand.</p>



<p>The color scheme remains true to the original with metallic and bronze shades that evoke the threatening demeanor of these war droids. They are proportioned just right too, the tapered shield generators and signature head shape instantly recognizable to any Star Wars buff. That attention to detail makes it ideal for display with your other Star Wars collectibles or even just as a display item that’ll spark conversations.</p>
<p>At this lower price, you are getting wonderful value for the upscale LEGO set designed specifically for adult fans. That original price of $64 was already quite reasonable for the number of pieces and quality of display, but at $48, this is the absolute bargain for any Star Wars fans.</p>
