Often it only takes one or two surprise reveals targeting the right genres and nostalgia centers for most players to come away with generally positive vibes. The July Nintendo Direct failed on that count. It didn’t help that a fresh flood of Switch 2 game key cards is sapping even some of the most diehard fans of any surplus enthusiasm.</p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="197565" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="Nintendo Switch 2 Could Launch With Almost No Reviews" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="122" data-playlist="197565,197567,196230" data-current="197565"><div><p>Nintendo Switch 2 Could Launch With Almost No Reviews</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197565/197565_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197565/197565_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197565/197565_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/23089.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>The<em> Mario</em> maker’s revelation that Thursday’s presentation would be a “Partner Showcase” instead of an all-out Nintendo Direct was the first blow to ambient online hype levels. Okay, no new 3D<em> Mario</em> announcements or<em> Metroid Prime 4</em> release date. But hey, at least fans could count on some major third-party reveals, including another raft of big ports. Surely Microsoft, rumored to be bringing the big guns to Switch 2 any day now, would show up. </p><p>Alas, no. Instead, the July Direct offered only a few smaller new game announcements—<em>Monster Hunter Stories 3: Twisted Reflection, Octopath Traveler 0</em>, and <em>The Adventures of Elliot: The Millennium Tales</em>—and mostly spent its time rehashing stuff we already knew about like <em>Star Wars Outlaws</em>, <em>Borderlands 4</em>, <em>Madden 26</em>, and <em>FC Sports 26</em>. Even a quick look at the next <em>Hyrule Warriors</em> felt thrown together and supremely underwhelming. And there was no big “oh shit!” moment like, say, <em>Gears of War: Reloaded</em> also coming to Switch 2. </p><p>The <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/NintendoSwitch2/comments/1me1wgt/gotta_say_that_rat_game_dont_look_half_bad/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/NintendoSwitch2/comments/1me1wgt/gotta_say_that_rat_game_dont_look_half_bad/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">litany of Switch 2 fan wish-casting</a></span> prior to the showcase had gotten out of control, but not even one of the numerous highly anticipated third-party updates made it into the showcase. No more footage of<em> Hollow Knight: Silksong</em>, no release date for <em>Hades 2</em>, and no mention of the rumored <em>Red Dead Redemption 2</em> port. Switch 2 versions of other recent blockbusters were also MIA. No surprise port of <em>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</em>, <em>Baldur’s Gate 3</em>, or <em>Lies of P</em>. There weren’t even updates on when players will be able to get their hands on the Switch 2 versions of <em>Final Fantasy VII Remake</em> or <em>Elden Ring</em>. </p><p><em>Chillin’ by the Fire</em>, one of the more unusual games announced during the Direct, now serves as the unlikely encapsulation of this disappointment. It’s a multiplayer game where you sit around a campfire with friends. “Your goal: Campfire Level 10,” reads the description. “The sense of accomplishment you feel when the firebed turns into bright red embers and the pillars of flame illuminate the night sky is more powerful than any scoreboard.” The gimmick is that it works with webcams to put players’ faces around the campfire. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/NintendoSwitch2/comments/1me35oe/peak_nintendo_switch2/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/NintendoSwitch2/comments/1me35oe/peak_nintendo_switch2/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Fans were not impressed</a></span>. <br></p><p>A Switch 2 port of last year’s <em>Persona 3: Reloaded</em>, one of the better pieces of news from the event, highlights the other prong of player disappointment. Diehard Nintendo fans like their physical games, RPG players more than most, but the physical version of<em> Persona 3</em> is the latest to rely on a game key card instead of an actual cartridge with the game on it. It was far from the only game key card game announced during the Direct. </p><p><em>Dragon Ball: Sparking Zero</em> is key card only too, as well as <em>Pac-Man World 2 Re-Pac</em>. <em>Octopath Traveler 0</em> is a game key card on Switch 2, but fortunately it’s also coming to the original Switch where it will have a standard cartridge. Unfortunately, that version of the game <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://bsky.app/profile/wario64.bsky.social/post/3lvbir7e7lc2l&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://bsky.app/profile/wario64.bsky.social/post/3lvbir7e7lc2l" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">will not have an upgrade path</a></span> to the Switch 2 version, so anyone who opts for the only physical version of the game on a Nintendo platform won’t be able to take advantage of any upgraded performance from the Switch 2 version. </p><p>There are still notable exceptions when it comes to the third-party publishers opting to cut corners with game key cards. At launch, the big one was<em> Cyberpunk 2077</em>, which fit the entire base game and its massive expansion on a 64GB card. <em>Rune Factory: Guardians of Azuma</em> is another, as is <em>Daemon X Machina: Titanic Scion </em>which arrives in September. It can be done, and it’s unfortunate to see many of the publishers of games whose audiences care the most about that sort of the thing being precisely the ones to opt out. No one cares if<em> Madden 26</em> comes on the cartridge, but why is <em>Final Fantasy Tactics </em>on Switch 2 <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://store.jp.square-enix.com/item/NXS_J_A43UA.html&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://store.jp.square-enix.com/item/NXS_J_A43UA.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">just a download code in a box</a></span>?</p><p>Does any of this matter to the average Switch 2 owner? Probably not. The console is good and there will be no shortage of games to play this fall. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.theverge.com/games/708909/nintendo-switch-2-donkey-kong-bananza-exclusive-release-schedule&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.theverge.com/games/708909/nintendo-switch-2-donkey-kong-bananza-exclusive-release-schedule" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Nintendo’s slow-drip strategy</a></span> is, all things considered, probably the smart thing to do. God knows there are more than enough games to keep everyone busy until long after they become worm food. But the last few years of the Switch 1 weren’t exactly blowing fans’ lids off, and the Switch 2's first summer, with the notable exception of <em>Donkey Kong Bananza</em>, has been a bit of a snoozefest. The first Nintendo Direct since the Switch 2 launched could have jolted fans back awake. Instead, the post-launch lull continues. </p><p>.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://kotaku.com/nintendo-direct-switch-2-key-cards-persona-3-octopath-1851787455]]></content:encoded>

Even though they confidently take a Rathalos fireball to the face in their introductory cutscene, Lagiacrus is weak to Fire. They also differ from other water monsters in that they’re not weak to Thunder, and instead use Thunder element attacks. All that to say, <strong>Fire-based weapons and Thunder-resistant armor will go a long way here</strong>.</p><p>I’ve had the most luck when keeping a +20 Thunder resistance. This hunt isn’t as bad as <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/monster-hunter-wilds-mh-mon-hun-arch-tempered-rey-dau-1851782762&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/monster-hunter-wilds-mh-mon-hun-arch-tempered-rey-dau-1851782762">Arch-Tempered Rey Dau</a></span>’s almost endless lightning strikes, but more than half of the attacks are electric. Being afflicted with Thunderblight and subsequently getting stunned is highly likely if your resistance isn’t high enough. </p><p>Besides a couple of projectile attacks, Lagiacrus’ physical attacks are similar to Mizutsune’s, in that they’ll cover a substantial amount of ground lunging and sweeping their entire body at you. Don’t expect a certain area to feel safer, the way you can lie low underneath <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/monster-hunter-wilds-mh-zoh-shia-crystals-farm-1851781913&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/monster-hunter-wilds-mh-zoh-shia-crystals-farm-1851781913">Zoh Shia</a></span>. Well-timed guards and evades are incredibly important for a fight like this.</p><p><strong>Prioritizing hits to the back is a smart way to restrict some of Lagiacrus’ Thunder attacks and collect the not-so-common Lagiacrus Shockspike material.</strong> Heavy Bowguns and other weapons with long reach will be fine, but Dual Blade users like me mostly have to rely on traps and mounting. A great method for any hunter to dish out damage to the back is by dodging through the monster’s massive discharge attack, since that can reveal a Focus Strike spot for a few seconds after.</p><p>The environment is a helpful friend in a fight like this. Never hesitate to lead it towards Poisoncups, Sporepuffs, or into a turf war with another monster. On the likely chance it moves to Area 15, trigger the Dam Rubble interactable with your slinger. You’ll deal a lot of damage and knock it down for a bit.</p><p>Lagiacrus will retreat to the newly added Area 19 at the tail end of the fight. It will briefly surface along the edge of Area 13, where you can trigger Unstable Rubble to fall and knock it out of the water. No matter if you interrupt its journey or not, you’ll track it to Area 19. Keep the hits coming to make the monster dive into the nearby water. This is when you can follow after it and fight the “Lord of the Seas” on its own turf.</p><figure id="" data-id="af69a4d7868f3f38a6c418c7a07ec608" data-recommend-id="image://af69a4d7868f3f38a6c418c7a07ec608" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Lagiacrus stares down at its prey." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Lagiacrus stares down at its prey." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Capcom / Samuel Moreno / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="af69a4d7868f3f38a6c418c7a07ec608" data-recommend-id="image://af69a4d7868f3f38a6c418c7a07ec608" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Lagiacrus stares down at its prey." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Bear in mind that underwater combat isn’t as fleshed out as regular combat. While there is free movement and access to the Evade button, you’ll mainly be fighting with your slinger. You can use it to drop Submerged Rubble, collect Piercing Pods, or directly latch onto Lagiacrus in a similar interaction to <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/monster-hunter-wilds-how-to-mount-master-mounter-1851775446&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/monster-hunter-wilds-how-to-mount-master-mounter-1851775446">Mounting</a></span>. The latter is the best way to deal big damage during this part of the hunt.</p><p>Hurt Lagiacrus enough during this phase to trigger a cool cinematic of your hunter smacking the hell out of it and taking the fight back on land. If there isn’t enough damage dealt, the watery serpent will quickly create a whirlpool that unleashes a massive discharge of electricity. Swim as far away as possible to avoid losing a majority of your health or even fainting. Either way, the fight will transition back up top for the final bout. Play it smart and you’ll be done soon enough.</p><p>Tempered Lagiacrus kicks the difficulty up many notches. Attacks are frequently chained together and they all hurt a lot. Evading seems to be a more manageable strategy than guarding against these attacks. I’ve seen great results using the Rey Dau <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/monster-hunter-wilds-mhw-armor-alpha-beta-gamma-arch-1851785351&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/monster-hunter-wilds-mhw-armor-alpha-beta-gamma-arch-1851785351">Gamma armor</a></span> that’s forged from fighting Arch-Tempered Rey Dau. On top of the included high Thunder Resistance, it offers many other useful skills for both offense and defense.
