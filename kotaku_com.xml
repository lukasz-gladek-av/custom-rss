<h2>This Groot Actually Dances</h2>
<p>Groot who first showed up on the big screen in 2014’s <em>Guardians of the Galaxy&nbsp;</em>has taken many shapes and sizes in his various appearances throughout the Marvel Cinematic Universe and the comics before that. Though, it is this writer’s humble opinion that the best version of this walking tree man is the one that didn’t walk at all. You may have forgotten he was once smaller than Baby Groot in the second&nbsp;<em>Guardians</em> flick. In the post credits scene following the first of the trilogy, we saw the new Groot come to life as a tiny twig in his pot, dancing to the music stylings of The Jackson 5.</p>
<p>This dancing Groot can be yours in Lego form. The <strong>459-piece set</strong> is fully posable with a head and arms that turn and move. At the back of the pot once fully constructed is a handle you can crank which makes Groot waist shift back and forth and arms go up and down, effectively making the little guy dance right before your eyes.</p>



<p>The flower pot can also be used to store extra pieces and accessories. The dancing Lego Groot does come with three different name plates. One depicts his iconic catchphrase (and practically only phrase), “I am Groot.” Another has the title on the movie while the last also shows the title of the movie but in James Gunn’s made-up space language. Lego Groot also comes with some extra leaves, headphones, and eve sunglasses which can be added or removed like some kind of modern-day Mr. Potato Head.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4464/">The Lego dancing Groot make for a great gift for Marvel fans of all ages. Get it for 20% off for a limited time.</a></p>

              <p>Players are still <a href="https://kotaku.com/xbox-game-pass-cancel-controversy-console-pc-2000631061">discovering new ways</a> in which their Xbox Game Pass subscriptions <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=+kotaku+xbox+game+pass&amp;sca_esv=1001961491ba09a8&amp;rlz=1C1ONGR_enUS1089US1089&amp;sxsrf=AE3TifOqnIJ-sk57N88LRgENtAPrEj6Ttg%3A1759496735838&amp;ei=H8rfaKH2MrOqptQPq6vCwQg&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjhgbGPjIiQAxUzlYkEHauVMIgQ4dUDCBA&amp;uact=5&amp;oq=+kotaku+xbox+game+pass&amp;gs_lp=Egxnd3Mtd2l6LXNlcnAiFiBrb3Rha3UgeGJveCBnYW1lIHBhc3NISFAAWABwAHgBkAEAmAEAoAEAqgEAuAEDyAEA-AEBmAIAoAIAmAMA4gMFEgExIECSBwCgBwCyBwC4BwDCBwDIBwA&amp;sclient=gws-wiz-serp">are getting worse</a>. <em>Call of Duty</em> is the latest target, with a 10-percent discount on <em>Call of Duty</em> points and add-on content like the BlackCell premium battle pass bundles. While small, the savings can quickly add up for dedicated fans over the annual lifecycle of a new entry in the series like <em>Call of Duty: Black Ops 7</em>.</p> <p>Spotted <a href="https://twitter.com/charlieINTEL/status/1973938451830747279?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1973938451830747279%7Ctwgr%5E2120216adb854b9deedab5678f7e582be9eee66d%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fkotaku.com%2Fwp%2Fwp-admin%2Fpost-new.php">by <em>CharlieIntel</em></a>, the 10-percent discount on buying<em> Call of Duty</em> points no longer appears for Game Pass Ultimate subscribers in the Xbox store. This impacts any add-on content players buy throughout the year, of which there is increasingly a ton. It’s another stealth nerf to the program not mentioned in Microsoft’s official blog post about the pricing changes this week. PC Game Pass going from $12 a month to $16.49 wasn’t listed either.</p>

 <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">Xbox has removed the 10% discount that Xbox Game Pass Ultimate members could get on add-on content for Call of Duty – including removing the discount on Call of Duty Points and BlackCell as part of the changes to Game Pass this week. <a href="https://t.co/ipaMgENuwi">pic.twitter.com/ipaMgENuwi</a></p> <p>— CharlieIntel (@charlieINTEL) <a href="https://twitter.com/charlieINTEL/status/1973938451830747279?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 3, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <p>It’s also the second discount that’s eroded under the new version of what used to be considered the best deal in gaming. Microsoft is also capping the Xbox Rewards fans can earn at lower tiers of the Game Pass subscription, as well as removing the option to spend those loyalty program points on additional months of Game Pass for a cheaper price. “They’ve been slowly enshitifying Rewards for a while now but this really is the nail in the coffin for anyone who uses points to pay for Game Pass,” <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Games/comments/1nujypo/microsoft_rewards_starting_october_1st_users_will/">wrote</a> one user on the subreddit. “You simply can’t earn enough in a month to pay for a month after this change.”</p> <p>Microsoft had previously teased the release of its first $80 games this fall beginning with<em> The Outer Worlds 2</em>, but ultimately ended up reversing course amid an ongoing backlash from players and likely soft-preorder numbers for the upcoming RPG shooter. So far at least, the tech giant hasn’t offered any signs it plans to compromise on the latest price hikes, even as it touts Game Pass’ profitability and annual revenue of $5 billion. “They’re on their villain arc,” one player <a href="https://x.com/MalikRules_/status/1973944018406179308">quipped</a> in response to the <em>Call of Duty</em> discount change.</p>
