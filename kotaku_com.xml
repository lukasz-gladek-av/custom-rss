After coming out from the other end, you’ll find Demineur.

It’s a challenging fight, so you’ll want to be at least level 80 if you intend to take Blanche on. Defeating Blanche will earn you 10x Colour of Lumina and 2x Grandiose Chroma Catalyst.</p><p>100x Colour of Lumina is definitely a much better reward than the 3x Colour of Lumina gained from defeating Demineur, which is why we recommend sparing them.</p><p>Alternatively, after receiving the 100x Colour of Lumina from Blanche, you can go back to the Flying Waters to kill Demineur and get those.</p><hr><p><em>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</em> is available now on PS5, Xbox Series X/S, and Windows PCs.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

This was revealed in a short story called “Bastet,” which focused on him and Ana, who were close comrades during the group’s heyday. In the story, Morrison reflects on his old flame, and it sounds like the two split because Soldier was so dedicated to the group’s cause that it put a strain on their relationship. But the game itself hasn’t really acknowledged Soldier’s long-lost love outside of a spray of the two giving each other the Christian Side Hug. That’s finally changed in <em>Overwatch 2</em>’s 16th season.</p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="195460" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="Overwatch 2's New Story Missions: Worth The Money?" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="122" data-playlist="195460,196880,197567" data-current="195460"><div><p>Overwatch 2's New Story Missions: Worth The Money?</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195460/195460_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195460/195460_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195460/195460_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195460/195460_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/20938.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>Blizzard periodically adds new pre-match interactions between its heroes with the start of a new season and in the big mid-season patch, often spotlighting a handful of characters with each new wave, rather than adding something for all 40+ heroes at once.
