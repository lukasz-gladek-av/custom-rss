At the time, the Chinese-made PlayStation 5 exclusive looked like another project heavily inspired by FromSoftware’s Soulsborne games. But <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/tokyo-game-show-2024-monster-hunter-wilds-mgs-3-remake-1851661898/slides/10&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/tokyo-game-show-2024-monster-hunter-wilds-mgs-3-remake-1851661898/slides/10">playable demos last year</a></span> revealed it’s much closer to a <em>Ninja Gaiden</em> or <em>Devil May Cry</em>-style action game. A new six-minute trailer shows exactly why, and gives the vibe that <em>Phantom Blade 0</em> could be the next <em>Black Myth: Wukong. </em><br></p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="194513" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="Blade’s Book Club Is The Best Thing About Marvel’s Midnight Suns" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="192" data-playlist="194513,197298,197284" data-current="194513"><div><p>Blade’s Book Club Is The Best Thing About Marvel’s Midnight Suns</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/194513/194513_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/194513/194513_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/194513/194513_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/194513/194513_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/19959.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>The new footage released in preparation for the Chinese New Year next week shows the game’s protagonist facing off in a boss fight against the “Seven Judgements,” a formation of warriors constantly trading attacks and healing one another. We also get a look at new snake-shaped swords, a venomous softblade, and savage ax and ink cut abilities, </p><p>The second phase of the boss fight shows one of the Seven Judgements resurrected as a puppet on a string swinging through the battlefield as death metal rock plays in the background. Again, while it all has the look and presentation of a <em>Dark Souls</em> game at first glance, the speed of combat and the array of abilities locates it much closer to a traditional action-game genre. The trailer ends with the puppet unleashing one final ultimate attack before being defeated.</p><p>Made by Bejing-based developer S-Game, <em>Phantom Blade Zero</em> is another blockbuster breakout from a studio that previously worked on much smaller games. It follows a warrior named Soul who is framed for a murder and has only 66 days to find the true killer, before a magic spell keeping him alive ends. Designer Soulframe Liang has called it a semi-open world game and likened its presentation to “kung fu punk.”</p><p>After <em>Black Myth: Wukong</em>—another debut AAA action game from a Chinese studio—became one of 2024's breakout hits, <em>Phantom Blade Zero</em> so far looks like it has the potential to follow a similar trajectory. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://x.com/DanielOlimac/status/1881776112025620742&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://x.com/DanielOlimac/status/1881776112025620742" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Gaming consultant Daniel Camilo claims</a></span> <em>Black Myth</em>’s success was actually crucial to getting extra funding for <em>Phantom Blade Zero</em>, suggesting the game might end up being even more ambitious than its developers initially planned. </p><p>We won’t know for sure until it actually comes out, and a release date has been conspicuously missing from the last year of gameplay reveals. Maybe S-Game is waiting for the next PlayStation showcase to reveal it. </p><p>.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

One of these features is the bigger Joy-Con controllers which now connect to the screen via magnetic attachments. A brief clip on the company’s website gives us a better look at how it works, but it’s an innovation that Nintendo  first teased over eight years ago. </p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="195670" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="This Stylish Noir-Punk Side-Scroller Is Like Celeste With Guns" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="184" data-playlist="195670,193658,194644" data-current="195670"><div><p>This Stylish Noir-Punk Side-Scroller Is Like Celeste With Guns</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195670/195670_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195670/195670_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195670/195670_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195670/195670_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/21167.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>The current Switch has its Joy-Con controllers attach by sliding through a railing on the side until a locking mechanism clicks them into place. Owners then press a very (very) small black button on the back to release the mechanism to slide them back out again. With the Switch 2 there’s no sliding and seemingly a whole lot less friction overall, as the Joy-Con merely click into place and hold on through the force of magnets alone.</p><p>A short snippet recently published on Nintendo’s website shows this all happening in slow motion, including how the (much) bigger triggers on the back of the Joy-Con are held to release the magnets and pull the controllers back away from the screen. It’s a much more elegant solution and, if combined with other Joy-Con features like <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/NintendoSwitch2/comments/1i31e7k/comment/m7p9qfn/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/NintendoSwitch2/comments/1i31e7k/comment/m7p9qfn/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">reported anti-drift Hall Effect joysticks</a></span>, mouse-like optical sensors, and a mysterious new C button, could make the Switch 2 feel like a bigger upgrade than it initially appears. </p><p>But it turns out that magnetic Joy-Con, one of the primary points of speculation <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/switch-2-reveal-trailer-date-nintendo-mario-kart-9-1851739487&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/switch-2-reveal-trailer-date-nintendo-mario-kart-9-1851739487">throughout months of Switch 2 leaks</a></span>, weren’t actually a secret at all. Nintendo revealed it was exploring the feature as early as its pre-release breakdown of the original Switch back in 2017. Here is Nintendo executive and <em>Super Mario Odyssey</em> producer Yoshiaki Koizumi teasing the design possibility to Nintendo of America’s <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCl0XiEgng4LZFpYVDd8oR8A&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCl0XiEgng4LZFpYVDd8oR8A" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Kit Ellis and Krysta Yang</a></span>, all the way back then:</p><p>“We tried a lot of different things in terms of connecting the Joy-Con to the console and one that I was particularly excited about at the time was using magnets where you would just snap it right to the console, but as you would play sometimes it would just fall into your lap,” he said at the time. “But because we still wanted to have something that was sturdy enough for you to hold onto the console but also gave you that sort of satisfying snap that the magnets did that’s how we came up with the mechanical rails that give you a click.”</p><p>Nintendo has a way of making its inventions, whether in hardware or the games themselves, feel like they magically appeared out of nowhere, but often it turns out  that they were leftover ideas from long and arduous trial and error processes, later repurposed when the moment is right or newer tech makes them more feasible. So it seems to be with the Switch 2's magnets. I’m super-eager to try them myself and see how they hold up. Hopefully, Nintendo worked out all the kinks this time around. </p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
