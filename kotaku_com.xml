              <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/metroid-prime-4-reviews-is-it-good-switch-2-nintendo-2000649621"><i><span>Metroid Prime 4: Beyond</span></i></a> <span>is out today. The Nintendo Switch/Switch 2 game was already getting dinged in some people’s minds over a trailer that showcased overly </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/metroid-prime-4-previews-trailer-ncps-companion-2000644368"><span>chatty companion characters</span></a><span>. Now we’ve moved on from side-eyeing MCU-era cringe to debates about whether or not the game even looks good. A lot of folks are throwing tomatoes at the supposedly lifeless open-world segments on social media, but people who are actually playing </span><i><span>Metroid Prime 4 </span></i><span>tell a different story.</span></p> <p><span>Admittedly, some </span><i><span>Metroid Prime 4 </span></i><span>screenshots are pretty rough. The game’s </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/metroid-prime-4-amiibo-samus-music-motorcycle-functionality-2000650508"><span>desert sections</span></a><span> can look pretty bland in still shots, and without any real dynamic weather effects or notable architecture and landmarks, they look like something out of a game from almost 20 years ago. The comparisons to older games that it resembles, or even older games that are doing a lot more with their environments, are not flattering.</span></p>

There are plenty of ugly areas in </span><i><span>Pokémon Legends: Arceus</span></i><span>, but there are also ones that look pretty lovely. </span><i><span>Scarlet </span></i><span>and </span><i><span>Violet</span></i><span>, though? That shit looks like an ugly GameCube game that was still in early development, no matter where you are. So when another big Nintendo game seems to be following the same open-world style at the expense of detailed environments, it’s understandable why some folks would be worried.</span></p>

 <p><span>In general, </span><i><span>Metroid Prime 4 </span></i><span>has some notable graphic disparities depending on the environment you’re in. Folks have been noting this before the game was even out by </span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Switch/comments/1nf7yrd/i_cant_wrap_my_head_around_how_theres_such_a_big/"><span>comparing shots from the same trailer</span></a><span>, in which the game oscillated between looking pretty alright to looking like the shots people are complaining about.</span></p>

 <p><span>That said, some of this feels like knee-jerk reactions to </span><i><span>Metroid Prime 4</span></i><span>’s series-low reviews. The game is sitting at </span><a href="https://www.metacritic.com/game/metroid-prime-4-beyond/"><span>a respectable 81 on review aggregate site Metacritic</span></a><span>, but that is a bit of a drop compared to the 90+ scores of the first three games. I saw folks on a ResetEra forum saying this was “an absolute failure” or a “fucking disaster” for the historically beloved series, so some of this drive-by hate feels a bit reactionary to a game some people have already decided is a flop.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><span>But what are people who have actually played the game saying? I was surprised to see some folks on my feed also call it one of the best-looking games Nintendo had brought to its handheld console. However, most of the praise points specifically to the smaller-scale dungeon areas, rather than the open-world ones, even comparing its mood and visual identity to the </span><i><span>Halo </span></i><span>games, which makes sense considering staff who used to work on the series at 343 Industries have </span><a href="https://x.com/Mr_Rebs_/status/1996542214466687263"><span>moved over to </span><i><span>Metroid Prime 4 </span></i><span>developer Retro</span></a><span>.</span></p>

 <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">Retro’s art design still rocks! Metroid Prime 4 is a visual stunner — and no framerate drops in sight. (Playing at 60fps right now — prefer visual clarity over 120fps, though it’s mighty nice on my LG M5, too) <a href="https://t.co/X1ZswwPfAV">pic.twitter.com/X1ZswwPfAV</a></p> <p>— Peer Schneider (@PeerIGN) <a href="https://twitter.com/PeerIGN/status/1996471091238498810?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 4, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <p><span>“…</span><i><span>Metroid Prime 4</span></i><span> is a technical marvel,” Vincent Acovino wrote over at </span><a href="https://www.npr.org/2025/12/02/nx-s1-5627515/metroid-prime-4-beyond-review"><i><span>NPR</span></i></a><span>. “[…] Colors pop, light dances off surfaces, particles drift, and choir vocals layer on top of ambient soundscapes. What Nintendo has done here is a model that the rest of the industry needs to take note of. Great art and music should take priority over unnecessarily taxing graphical ‘innovations.’”</span></p>

 <p><span>“Within each dungeon-like area to explore, Metroid Prime 4 shines, mixing tactile FPS exploration with gorgeous visuals and impeccable atmosphere,” Oscar Taylor-Kent said in the </span><a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/metroid/metroid-prime-4-beyond-review/"><i><span>GamesRadar+</span></i></a><span> review.</span></p> <p><span>Now that players have </span><i><span>Metroid Prime 4</span></i><span> in their hands, some are </span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/NintendoSwitch2/comments/1pdrahj/stunned_how_good_prime_4_looks_within_first_hour/"><span>praising the visuals</span></a><span>, especially in those smaller, more focused spaces.</span></p> <p><span>“Retro is a master of using mostly baked plus some tasteful dynamic lighting to achieve great visuals,” Reddit user threeinacorner wrote.</span></p> <p><span>“You really need to see it on a highly capable OLED TV with really good HDR.

That probably won’t stop the internet from taking a bad picture and running with it, though.&nbsp;</span></p>

              <p>Xbox Game Pass has gone through some turbulent times of late, the <a href="https://kotaku.com/xbox-game-pass-cancel-controversy-console-pc-2000631061">sheen completely coming off the subscription service</a> as it made <a href="https://kotaku.com/xbox-game-pass-price-increase-standard-console-ultimate-1851583866">its cheaper tiers much less worthwhile</a>, followed by a series of price increases building to October’s <a href="https://kotaku.com/xbox-game-pass-gets-massive-price-hike-yet-amid-big-changes-2000630604">sudden 50 percent hike</a>. $30 a month is a heck of an investment, given that in 2023 it cost half of that, so if you’re paying, you’ll want to get the best out of it. And with over 400 games currently included, finding the stuff worth playing gets harder and harder. So to make life easier, we’ve gone through the jumbled pile and picked out the 10 best RPGs to play.</p> <p>There are, by Microsoft’s count, 307 games on Xbox Game Pass that it considers to be RPGs. But given that <a href="https://kotaku.com/genres-fps-hero-shooter-adventure-rts-action-opinion-1851772168">genre titles mean close to nothing now</a>, and all genres are merging together, a fair number of them are stretches. For instance, this list isn’t going to include any&nbsp;<em>Assassin’s Creed</em> games, no matter how many RPG elements the series has begun to include over the years. They can have their day in a Best Action Games list and be happy about it.</p>

 <p>Anyway, here are 10 of the best RPGs to install on your Xbox if you’re subscribed to Game Pass, with a good mix of the blatantly obvious and the somewhat more obscure.</p> <hr> <h2>Avowed</h2>  <p>I said it’d include the obvious, but it’d be criminal not to recommend one of the best new RPGs in&nbsp;<em>years</em>. Obsidian’s first/third-person free-roaming take on its glorious&nbsp;<em>Pillars of Eternity</em> series proved to be <a href="https://kotaku.com/avowed-xbox-pc-rpg-game-pass-skyrim-review-kotaku-1851761525">an absolutely cracking success</a>. It’s real-time magic-n-swords combat works brilliantly, in a world that’s as rich and detailed and packed with character as either of the previous, more traditional <em>Pillars</em> games. Plus, it offers so many extraordinary choices that you can play it all over again as soon as you’re done.</p>

 <hr> <h2>Dragon Age: Origins</h2>  <p>If you prefer, you can assume this entry to be for any of the&nbsp;<em>Dragon Age&nbsp;</em>games, given EA has all four of them included on Game Pass, including last year’s <em>Dragon Age: The Veilguard</em>. But the first one, <em>Origins</em>, will always be the best. It was the result of ten years of work, with an obvious depth of lore and history showing the results of such an extraordinary investment of time. It also plays out with a combination of real-time and pauseable combat, allowing you to approach it new-school or old. It is one of the most wonderful RPG stories ever told.</p>

 <hr> <h2>Fallout: New Vegas (PC Only)</h2>  <p>Yes, you can play the more recently revamped&nbsp;<em>Fallout 4</em> on Game Pass too, but if I’m picking just one of the series’ first-person era, it has to be Obsidian’s <em>New Vegas</em>. It’s scientifically proven to be the best of the lot, and it remains a gruesome tragedy that it’s not received a modern glow-up. But what better time to play this incredibly deep, post-apocalyptic RPG than in the weeks before Amazon Prime’s stunning&nbsp;<em>Fallout</em> TV series reaches Vegas in its second season?</p>

 <hr> <h2>Moonlighter</h2>  <p>At a time when so many would-be RPGs have split off into the realm of the roguelite,&nbsp;<em>Moonlighter</em> straddles the two fields like a mighty but modest titan. This adorably splendid game combines running a local store with the need to go off on deathly adventures to find loot to sell in said store. The result is a gorgeous mix of action-RPG and shop-running, town-building loveliness. There’s a sequel in early access on Game Pass too.</p>

 <hr> <h2>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</h2>  <p>One of 2025’s breakout hits, not least thanks <a href="https://kotaku.com/clair-obscur-expedition-33-game-pass-xbox-goty-2000650073">to its inclusion on Game Pass</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://kotaku.com/clair-obscur-expedition-33-rpg-review-in-progress-1851777402"><em>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</em></a> has made turn-based RPG combat sexy again. The <a href="https://kotaku.com/indie-game-awards-iga-igf-gdc-clair-obscur-expedition-33-2000644070">definitely-not-an-indie game</a> from French developers Sandfall Interactive has a story that twists and turns as its chapters progress, a uniquely interesting defense system, and a voice cast to die for.</p>

 <hr>   <p>There’s no escaping it. It might be 14 years old (although this Special Edition is a mere nine), but <em>Skyrim</em> is still one of the best RPGs ever made. Bethesda’s colossal open-world RPG (long before everyone else was doing that) is still one of the most splendid ways to wile away a spare couple of months. Grab a horse, climb a mountain, find a mysterious cave, turn into a vampire, join a cult, and begin a life of crime, all before lunch.</p> <hr> <h2>Arx Fatalis (PC only)</h2>  <p>I’ve tried to stick to RPG games that can be played on both Xbox consoles and PC, but I can’t leave&nbsp;<em>Arx Fatalis</em> off the list. This is from Arkane, the creators of <em>Dishonored</em> and&nbsp;<em>Prey</em>, and it’s every bit as much a demonstration of that (monstrously closed) studio’s talent. Originally released in 2002, despite being great, this was a first-person RPG that your dad loved but was a commercial flop. Thanks to the same hateful deal that killed Arkane, the game is now in Microsoft/Bethesda’s library and on Game Pass.</p> <hr> <h2>Citizen Sleeper 2</h2>  <p>Both&nbsp;<em>Citizen Sleeper</em> and its sequel are on Xbox Game Pass, so you can start at the beginning of these dark, cyber-noir RPG adventures if you so choose. The original game takes place around a single planet, the second an entire solar system, where the roll of the dice decides so much of the fate from which you’re endlessly trying to escape. They’re <a href="https://kotaku.com/citizen-sleeper-2-review-steam-rpg-scifi-cowboy-bebop-1851751947">fantastic games</a>, unlike anything else out there, with stunning writing and the sensibilities of the best of tabletop gaming.</p>

 <hr> <h2>Diablo IV</h2>  <p>As much as I may have moaned about genre blurring at the start, there’s no question that action-RPGs are RPGs. For a while, the genre was so specifically dominated by <em>Diablo</em> that it was known as “Diablo-likes,” and it remains the case that Blizzard’s creations rule the roost. Yes, there are those who play these games for their endgame loops and grinds, but don’t let that put you off: clicking your way through the story and combat of the core game is a rewarding experience in its own right.</p> <hr> <h2>Mass Effect Legendary Edition</h2>  <p>Has there been a more consistently great trilogy of RPG games than&nbsp;<em>Mass Effect</em>? Well, have it out in the comments. But in the meantime,&nbsp;<em>Mass Effect</em>‘s&nbsp;<em>Legendary Edition</em> is all three of the&nbsp;<em>good</em> games in the series, remastered in 4K, and with all 40 pieces of DLC. It’s a glorious story, and while many were unsatisfied with the (excellent—fight me) ending, the space adventure trilogy remains one of video gaming’s all-time highlights.</p> <hr> <p>Your favorite Game Pass RPG isn’t here? That’s because we found out you like it so much and deliberately left it off the list to make you mad. So get revenge by explaining what you’d have included instead of&nbsp;<em>Arx Fatalis</em> in the comments.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Amazon Dumps This Mini PC at Its Cheapest Price Ever, a 4.5-Star Windows Backup Even if You Own a Mac Mini]]></title>
            <link>https://kotaku.com/amazon-dumps-this-mini-pc-at-its-cheapest-price-ever-a-4-5-star-windows-backup-even-if-you-own-a-mac-mini-2000650495</link>
            <guid>1373122</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Desk space can be pretty limited, so the last thing you may want is a bulky PC tower taking up half of it. A mini PC is a great solution, offering the same functionality while taking up hardly any room. Whether you’re a business owner, student, or casual user, a mini PC is ideal—and it’s usually more affordable. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6214/">Take a look here: the GMKtec Mini NucBox G5 PC is typically priced at $260, but right now, it’s available at a 31% discount, bringing it down to just $180—saving you $80.</a></p>
<p>This compact device measures just 2.83 x 2.83 x 1.75 inches, making it small enough to fit in your pocket. It’s powered by an Intel 12th-generation Alder Lake N97 processor, capable of reaching speeds up to 3.6GHz. This should be more than enough for everyday tasks like web browsing, light creative work, software development, or playing casual games. It comes with 12GB of RAM and a 256GB SSD, which you can upgrade to as much as 2TB if needed.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6214/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<p>With Wi-Fi 5 support, you can enjoy fast upload and download speeds when connected to a Wi-Fi 5 network. The mini PC also features Bluetooth 5.0, making it easy to connect to various accessories. Ports include two USB 3.2 slots on the front and one on the back, plus a USB-C port. The HDMI output supports up to 4K resolution at 60Hz, and with dual HDMI ports, you can connect two displays at once—no need for a docking station. There’s also an AUX jack for connecting headphones or desktop speakers.</p>
<h2>Why Choose a Mini PC?</h2>
<p>If you’re living in a small apartment or sharing a space with roommates, you probably know that every inch of your desk matters. A large PC tower can take up precious room that you may not be willing to sacrifice. A mini PC, on the other hand, offers a lot of the capabilities of a desktop PC but in a much smaller footprint. This one is even small enough that you could feasibly mount it to the back of a monitor, so it effectively would have no foot print at all.</p>



<p>Mini PCs also make great multimedia players. While many modern TVs have smart features with the ability to play from apps like Netflix and Hulu, a mini PC can still make for a better option that just using what’s built into your TV. It’s a full Windows device, meaning it can handle more types of media formats (especially for locally saved files) than your typical smart TV or streaming stick.</p>
<p>Additionally, a mini PC is perfect for running a PLEX server, allowing you to access your media library from anywhere. They’re also great for emulating retro games, as they don’t require much processing power to run ROMs. Just make sure you legally own the games you are emulating, but also I’m not the one checking up on you. You do you.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/amazon-pushes-the-razer-customizable-gaming-keypad-to-its-lowest-price-as-stock-runs-out-2000650248</link>
            <guid>1373068</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>With Black Friday and Cyber Monday having passed, you might be thinking times up for finding great deals on tech and gaming stuff. But oh, my friend, you could not be more wrong. Amazon still has a number of deals still active following the huge savings weekend. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6204/">For instance, this Razer Tartarus V2 gaming keypad went on sale just before Black Friday to its lowest price on record and has remained since</a>. The gaming keypad usually goes for $80, so that 25% ends up chopping off $20—bringing the price you pay to only $60. No telling when the price will jump back up, so if you’re still shopping for the right gift for your gamer pal or are just looking to upgrade your own gaming setup, now’s the time to do it.</p>
<p>Let’s chat about mice, keyboard and controller for a moment. For some genres, the best way to play is obvious. A real-time strategy game? That’s gotta be mouse and keyboard. Racing games? Need to go with controller for those analog triggers. Though, some genres are debatable—particularly the first-person shooter.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6204/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<p>With a mouse, you have pin-point control over your aim, able to accelerate naturally, as fast as you can move the mouse. And yet, movement is limited. the W, A, S, D, control scheme doesn’t allow for precise control over your walking speed. Plus you’re limited to exactly eight directions of movement.</p>
<p>On controller, you can decide how fast you move, and have a full 360-degree range of movement with the left analog stick. However, your view relies on the right analog stick, which can only turn so fast and offers a much more limited control.</p>
<h2>Best of Both Worlds</h2>
<p>Hannah Montanna knew best. You need the best of both worlds—and the Razer Tartarus V2 is just that.</p>
<p>The Tartarus looks like someone hacked up a keyboard and glued a joy-stick to the side (complimentary). With it, you now have a directional thumbpad for more natural controls, closer to what console-oriented players are used to. And then your remaining four fingers can still have access to all the keys you need. There’s also a scroll wheel.</p>



<p>The Razer Tartarus V2 features 32 mecha-membrane keys. They provide the tactile feedback and satisfaction of pressing down a mechanical key. They are are individually programmable so you can set it however you like to support your gaming or for use in creative workflows such as video or photo editing. You can even program macros, allowing for multiple key and keypress combinations in order to execute complex commands.</p>
<p>The gaming keypad is built with an ergonomic palm rest which is both adjustable and detachable, so you can customize your set up to whatever best matches your preferences and comfort.</p>
<p>And it of course would not be a proper Gamer with a capital G accessory without proper RGB lighting. The Razer Tartarus V2 gaming keypad offers full Razer Chroma supports. You can have the keypad fully synchronize with the game you’re playing or even with your Philips Hue lights if you’d got them.</p>

              <p>The analysts have seen enough: <a href="https://kotaku.com/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-review-campaign-is-it-good-zombies-multiplayer-2000645198"><em>Call of Duty</em>‘s having a bad year</a>. Also <em>Helldivers 2</em> is sending players into lava pits and a major <em>Elder Scrolls</em> fan game gets another understandable delay. It’s the latest edition of Morning Checkpoint, our daily roundup of gaming news and culture. It’s a big day for new game releases with <a href="https://kotaku.com/metroid-prime-4-reviews-is-it-good-switch-2-nintendo-2000649621"><em>Metroid Prime 4</em></a>, <a href="https://kotaku.com/octopath-traveler-0-the-kotaku-review-2000650015"><em>Octopath Traveler 0</em></a>, and <a href="https://kotaku.com/routine-alien-isolation-sci-fi-horror-review-creepy-scary-moon-xbox-pc-2000649242"><em>Routine</em></a> all coming out at the same time. I wish I could find the time! Instead, I’ll be busy facing new bosses in<a href="https://kotaku.com/nightreigh-forsaken-hollows-dlc-launch-time-patch-notes-2000650150"><em> Elden Ring Nightreign</em>‘s first DLC</a> and muddling my way through a good but all-too-brief new <a href="https://kotaku.com/destiny-2-renegades-star-wars-power-reset-2000632488"><em>Destiny 2 Star Wars</em> campaign</a> called&nbsp;<em>Renegades</em>.</p> <h2>The biggest<em> Elder Scrolls</em> mod project going gets another delay</h2>  <p><em>Skyblivion</em>, to almost no one’s surprise, won’t make its planned 2025 release date after all. The long-standing fan project that recreates <em>The Elder Scrolls IV</em> inside <em>Skyrim</em> using the latter’s engine needs a bit more time to cook. Considering it’s the work of over 70 unpaid volunteers, I think the wait is understandable. Plus, it will give it more of a buffer from Bethesda’s own <em>Oblivion Remastered</em> launch earlier this year.</p>

 <h2>Sony is publishing JJ Abrams’ production company’s first game developed by Left 4 Dead’s director</h2> <p>It’s a buzzy mouthful indeed. Here’s the press release: “Sony Interactive Entertainment (SIE) today announced a partnership with video game studio Bad Robot Games, a division of Bad Robot, the film, television and theater production company founded by JJ Abrams, for SIE to produce and publish the studio’s upcoming project, an unannounced four-player, cooperative shooter directed by Mike Booth&nbsp;<em>(Left 4 Dead</em>).”</p>

 <p>The game will come to PS5 and PC, but there’s currently no other information known about it. Maybe a tease at The Game Awards?</p> <h2>“Fewer people are playing <em>Call of Duty</em> this year than they have been before”</h2> <p>That’s according to Chris Dring of<em> The Game Business</em> <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-sales-expert-opinion">who spoke to<em> Eurogamer</em></a> about the <a href="https://kotaku.com/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-player-count-battlefield-6-2000646316">relative crickets</a> around <em>Black Ops 7</em>‘s launch. Activision hasn’t shared any hard data on player counts or sales figures, though the metrics analysts are tracking and estimating sound much worse than usual.</p>

 <p>“But actually, I track daily active users, and all year <em>Call of Duty</em>‘s numbers have been quite low-lower than usual. There have been some exceptions though, January was great coming off <em>Black Ops 6</em>, there was a boost in April / May, but generally speaking, fewer people are playing <em>Call of Duty</em> this year than they have been before,” Dring said. “That’s despite <em>Black Ops 6</em> as the previous game being brilliant in people’s eyes. In fact, in September, it was the lowest point I’ve seen <em>Call of Duty</em> since the launch of their <em>Call of Duty HQ</em>.”</p>

 <p>He and Alinea Analytics’ Rhys Elliot blame a lack of innovation, a <a href="https://kotaku.com/cod-blops-7-campaign-coop-always-online-pause-co-op-xp-challenges-2000644358">bad, always-online campaign</a>, poor marketing, lots of competition in the shooter space, and general franchise burnout for the lackluster response. Will any of that actually stop <em>Black Ops 7</em> from being one of this year’s top-sellers? <a href="https://kotaku.com/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-multiplayer-review-impressions-2000647644">Probably not</a>.</p>

 <h2><em>Helldivers 2</em> just got lava planets</h2>  <p>The extraction shooter’s latest “Into the Unjust” update has taken players into a fight with the automatons on <em>Helldivers 2</em>‘s version of <em>Mustafar. “</em>Too hot for humans, too unstable for farming, too explosive for tourism—yet rich in minerals,” reads the description. “Minerals the Automatons steal with every drill. Their unsanctioned mining not only threatens humanity’s expansion, but the very survival of managed democracy itself.”</p>

 <h2>The AI bubble continues to threaten gaming</h2> <p>SSD and RAM maker Micron announced it’s getting out of the consumer business to focus on manufacturing for companies’ AI computing needs. “The AI-driven growth in the data center has led to a surge in demand for memory and storage. Micron has made the difficult decision to exit the Crucial consumer business in order to improve supply and support for our larger, strategic customers in faster-growing segments,” said Chief Business Officer Sumit Sadana <a href="https://investors.micron.com/news-releases/news-release-details/micron-announces-exit-crucial-consumer-business">in a statement</a>.</p> <p>The news comes as wider RAM shortages seem poised to jack up the prices of PC and console gaming even further, with pricing pressure hitting companies like AMD which is already the confirmed tech partner for PlayStation 6, Steam Machine, and the next-gen Xbox.</p> <h2>Hideo Kojima will talk about going indie at GDC 2026</h2> <p>The <em>Death Stranding 2</em> director was named the keynote speaker for a talk titled “Restarting from Zero: A Message to Creators Considering Independence.” Scheduled to kick off GDC’s revamped “Festival of Gaming” taking place March 9 through 13, the presentation is expected to detail the famed developer’s journey after leaving Konami and the “pitfalls” his team overcame after starting from scratch.</p> <h2>ICYMI:</h2> <ul> <li><a href="https://kotaku.com/final-fantasy-7-remake-rebirth-aerith-voice-actor-smut-2000650164"><em>Final Fantasy VII Remake</em>‘s voice actor is tired of being sent Aerith porn&nbsp;</a></li> <li><a href="https://kotaku.com/where-winds-meet-ai-npc-llm-chatgpt-steam-2000650074">Generative AI NPCs are getting tricked with sex prompts&nbsp;</a></li> <li><a href="https://kotaku.com/mcdonalds-new-grinch-meal-shaker-shake-fries-pickle-holiday-christmas-meal-2000650144">McDonalds has new fries and they’re actually very, very good</a></li> </ul> <h2>Watch this:</h2>
