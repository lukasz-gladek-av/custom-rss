Both the type of material you receive from the Appraisal and its traits are completely random. The only thing that’s different across the Tempered Monsters is that tougher foes will grant higher rarity materials, similar to Hunter Symbols. <strong>My recommendation is to either hunt the strongest Tempered Monsters for rarer materials or take on quests that involve two of them so that you leave with double the amount of rewards.</strong></p><p>Hunting strong enemies isn’t the only option to attain these rare items. <strong>Another way to get Artian Materials is to visit the Melding Pot in Suja to turn unwanted Artian Materials into randomized new ones.</strong> This works just like Smelting in the Oilwell Basin, with each material you use filling up a point gauge. The option is labeled as Meld Relics and will first unlock after completing the Chapter Five Storm-Cold Vortex quest. Once you reach hunter rank 100, you’ll also unlock the option to directly craft a high-rarity material of your choice.</p><h2 id="h172098"><a id="forge"></a>How to Forge Artian Weapons</h2><figure id="" data-id="0e1d09243d21977ac802ecc0128b791d" data-recommend-id="image://0e1d09243d21977ac802ecc0128b791d" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The Forge Artian Weapon screen, with two parts selected for making an Artian Lance." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="The Forge Artian Weapon screen, with two parts selected for making an Artian Lance." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Capcom / Samuel Moreno / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="0e1d09243d21977ac802ecc0128b791d" data-recommend-id="image://0e1d09243d21977ac802ecc0128b791d" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The Forge Artian Weapon screen, with two parts selected for making an Artian Lance." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>All of the above leads to finally forging one of these special weapons. You can do so by using the “Forge Artian Weapons” option in Gemma’s Smithy menu and offering up three Artian Materials. Not only does each weapon type use a different mix of materials, but they all need to be the same rarity to be forged together as well. Don’t be surprised if you need to hunt quite a few Tempered Monsters before it’s possible to create exactly what you want.</p><p>Selecting two materials with the same element type will grant that element to your weapon. If the third material also shares the element type, it will add an element stat bonus. Although this won’t apply when forging an Artian <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/monster-hunter-wild-heavy-light-bowgun-differences-best-1851773364&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/monster-hunter-wild-heavy-light-bowgun-differences-best-1851773364">Heavy or Light Bowgun</a></span>, it will enable the use of the corresponding ammo type.</p><h2 id="h172099"><a id="reinforce"></a>How to reinforce Artian Weapons</h2><figure id="" data-id="0cfc0873a31b590d280c3e50cac412cf" data-recommend-id="image://0cfc0873a31b590d280c3e50cac412cf" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The Reinforce/Dismantle Artian Weapon screen, with enough materials set to max out the Artian Lance I." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="The Reinforce/Dismantle Artian Weapon screen, with enough materials set to max out the Artian Lance I." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Capcom / Samuel Moreno / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="0cfc0873a31b590d280c3e50cac412cf" data-recommend-id="image://0cfc0873a31b590d280c3e50cac412cf" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The Reinforce/Dismantle Artian Weapon screen, with enough materials set to max out the Artian Lance I." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>We can still take it one more step after Forging. Choosing the <em>Reinforce/Dismantle Artian Weapons</em> option in the Smithy menu can increase the power of these new weapons with up to five Reinforcement Bonuses. This process requires materials you gain from Festival Shares or through smelting ore. The only wrinkle is that what you receive is randomly distributed among the following bonuses:</p><ul data-type="List" data-style="Bullet"><li>Affinity Boost</li><li>Attack Boost</li><li>Element Boost</li><li>Sharpness Boost</li><li>Ammo Capacity (only for the Bowguns)</li></ul><p>Technically, you can re-roll Reinforcement Bonuses until you have what you need for your dream weapon. There appears to be an internal seed list for these enhancements that are assigned to an Artian Weapon once they’re initially forged. That means you’ll need to forge and reinforce multiple trash weapons, preferably without saving, until you find the best set of bonuses.</p><p>Let’s say you want to make the dream <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/monster-hunter-wilds-best-weapon-the-charge-blade-guide-1851769340&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/monster-hunter-wilds-best-weapon-the-charge-blade-guide-1851769340">Charge Blade</a></span>, because who wouldn’t? You’ll have to keep maxing out these Artian Weapons until you discover that the sixth weapon will have the stats you want. Now you’ll need to exit without saving and reload your previous save. Forge five of those trash Artian Charge Blades again, and then finally forge your ideal Charge Blade that will pair seamlessly with the perfect Reinforcement Bonuses.</p><p>It’s a tedious process that can require a lot of money and a lot of materials. I would only recommend doing this if you’re super serious about min-maxing your stats. Unless the RNG completely screws you over with the bonuses, most of the time these Artian Weapons will be a beneficial option.</p><hr><p><br><em>Monster Hunter Wilds</em> is available now on PS5, Xbox Series X/S, and Windows PCs.   </p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

However, every time a new story comes out about how studio in-fighting and corporate favoritism affected the project, it feels like more of a miracle that the fantasy RPG got out the door looking like a classic BioWare game. Mark Darrah, the former executive producer of the <em>Dragon Age </em>series, has released a new YouTube video in which he discusses how a few events in 2017 fundamentally changed the trajectory of the RPG studio and how, according to him, <em>Dragon Age</em> was thrown under the bus in more ways than one during this time.</p><p>Darrah’s 16-minute video runs down how things shifted at BioWare in the months leading up to <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/mass-effect-andromeda-the-kotaku-review-1793496930&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/mass-effect-andromeda-the-kotaku-review-1793496930"><em>Mass Effect: Andromeda</em>’s</a></span> launch in 2017, a period of change that he calls “the most impactful 12 months” in the studio’s history. In late 2016 Darrah, who had been working on <em>Dragon Age</em>, began instead leading the team that would oversee the closing months of the sci-fi RPG’s development cycle. He explains that his transfer felt like a blow to the <em>Dragon Age </em>team, which was then working on one of the early iterations of the fantasy series’ fourth entry, as Darrah had been a key member of its leadership. However, Darrah thought that by helping ship <em>Andromeda</em>, he could then see the resources dedicated to the game reallocated to help the <em>Dragon Age </em>team develop the fantasy RPG. But unfortunately, that’s not what happened.</p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="196742" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="What Is Dragonsplague?

Darrah says the short time he spent working on <em>Andromeda</em> didn’t ultimately have much of an impact on <em>Dragon Age</em>’s development, but it did set a precedent establishing that leadership could be moved around within the company, even if they were in the middle of directing something else. This move contributed to a perception that <em>Dragon Age </em>wasn’t a priority within the company.</p><p>Darrah goes on to explain how the relationship between BioWare and EA changed at this time, as the studio started reporting to a different arm of the publisher. Prior to this, BioWare was “strangely” reporting to higher-ups in the company’s sports section, a group which Darrah described as “benignly disinterested,” allowing the studio to work more autonomously. Then, when things shifted in 2017, BioWare started reporting to a branch of EA that was “hyper interested” in the decision-making process. According to Darrah, this change in leadership was likely part of why the studio moved on from <em>Andromeda </em>so quickly, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/bioware-confirms-no-dlc-for-mass-effect-andromeda-1798069090&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/bioware-confirms-no-dlc-for-mass-effect-andromeda-1798069090">canceling the game’s planned DLC</a></span> and <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/sources-bioware-montreal-downsized-mass-effect-put-on-1795100285&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/sources-bioware-montreal-downsized-mass-effect-put-on-1795100285">putting the sci-fi series on ice</a></span>.</p><p>“The group that we reported into had very little stake in either the success or the failure of [<em>Mass Effect: Andromeda</em>], and they had a lot more incentive for BioWare to move on to the next thing that they could tie themselves to and show themselves as having influence on the development of,” Darrah said.</p><p>As BioWare geared up for the next game, the <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/how-biowares-anthem-went-wrong-1833731964&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/how-biowares-anthem-went-wrong-1833731964">much-maligned looter shooter <em>Anthem</em></a></span>, Darrah says he received “assurances” from EA and BioWare leadership that <em>Dragon Age</em> was important to the company, but not the kinds of developers and resources that would back those statements up. And it was all made a lot more complicated by the return of ex-<em>Mass Effect </em>director Casey Hudson, who rejoined the company as its general manager in 2017. Darrah says he learned about Hudson’s return at the same time as the rest of the company, despite being a senior member of BioWare’s leadership team. He says he considered the decision to bring Hudson back without consulting him a sign of “an immense amount of disrespect,” and he sent emails shortly after the announcement that said he expected Hudson would make a call to “starve” <em>Dragon Age</em> of resources as the studio went all-hands-on-deck on <em>Anthem</em>. Darrah was once again reassured by leadership that <em>Dragon Age</em> was important to the company and that they were committed to him leading the project.</p><p>“As we all know, that’s not what happened at all,” Darrah says. “In very short order, in basically exactly the way that I predicted, <em>Anthem</em> was seen as needing greater leadership support, and myself and some other very senior people, and a large percentage of the <em>Dragon Age</em> team, was moved onto <em>Anthem</em>.”</p><p>This was followed by the <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/sources-bioware-montreal-downsized-mass-effect-put-on-1795100285&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/sources-bioware-montreal-downsized-mass-effect-put-on-1795100285">scaling down of BioWare’s Montreal studio</a></span>, which saw many staff members moved to other teams across the EA umbrella. Darrah says that the Montreal team had “basically been lied to” and were told that the <em>Dragon Age</em> team “didn’t want” them. He also claims that he was trying to get the next <em>Dragon Age</em> past a certain development threshold which he hoped might allow him to retain those developers, but EA higher-ups who were local in Montreal wanted those people, and “proximity is a powerful tool.”</p><p>“If you are someone who’s been mad at me since 2017 because you feel like I abandoned you in Montreal, know that that’s not what happened,” Darrah says. “Know that I fought with every tool that I knew how to wield to try and keep you, but the organization had no interest in that occurring.”</p><p>Whatever the circumstances, Darrah says EA wasn’t interested in helping the <em>Dragon Age</em> team grow; it wanted <em>Anthem</em> to get off the ground and be a huge live-service hit for the company. Darrah hypothesizes that, at this point, management pivoted the <em>Dragon Age </em>project <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/the-past-and-present-of-dragon-age-4-1833913351&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/the-past-and-present-of-dragon-age-4-1833913351">into the now-scrapped live-service game</a></span> as a “rationalization” for removing many members of the team and putting them to work on <em>Anthem</em>. Now that the next <em>Dragon Age </em>was going back to the drawing board, it could be argued that the project didn’t need that big of a team in its early production stages. The move also resulted in a longer “leadership discontinuity,” as Darrah worked on <em>Anthem </em>until the game shipped in 2019.</p><p>“I talked a fairly long time ago about how EA buys studios and then consumes them and they start to lose their culture into the overall EA culture,” Darrah said. “To me, it feels like 2017 is when EA finished digesting BioWare, which they had bought nine years earlier in 2008.”</p><p>Darrah acknowledges that much of his story might sound like a series of events that affected him personally rather than the studio at large, but a handful of ex-BioWare employees have <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://bsky.app/profile/mikelaidlaw.bsky.social/post/3lojswdjt2k2l&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://bsky.app/profile/mikelaidlaw.bsky.social/post/3lojswdjt2k2l" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">shared the video on social media</a></span> and <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://bsky.app/profile/joberry.bsky.social/post/3lojt2sh3rs2m&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://bsky.app/profile/joberry.bsky.social/post/3lojt2sh3rs2m" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">corroborated</a></span> the <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://bsky.app/profile/davidgaider.bsky.social/post/3lokc3rbmrc25&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://bsky.app/profile/davidgaider.bsky.social/post/3lokc3rbmrc25" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">events described</a></span>.
