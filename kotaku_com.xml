              <p>Okay, people. Listen here. Amazon has the Apple AirPods Pro 2 wireless earbuds on sale for a good 32% off.<a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4044/"> It‚Äôs not too often we see Apple stuff getting a discount, so now‚Äôs a great time to upgrade your earbuds or pick up an extra set as the pair has come down to just $170</a>. These AirPods are usually set at $249 so you‚Äôre looking at a $79 discount. The model here is the second generation of the Pro 2, which support a wide range of useful features with the new iOS. So if you plan on listening with these behind your computer at work, sitting on the train, or pumping iron at the gym, these everyday best-selling premium earbuds can help you make that time much more enjoyable.</p>

<h2>A Rich Audio Experience</h2>
<p>Now, this specific set of AirPods Pro 2 have been engineered with the Apple H2 chip. The computational power it provides allow the earbuds to perform intelligent noise cancellation with deep immersive sound. The ANC is twice as powerful as comparable earbuds from other brands. For you, that means less unwanted noise and better focus on what you want to hear. They can drown out the sounds of a plane engine or just keep muzzled the noisy sounds of a busy office. Along with that, you can also watch and listen to select songs, shows, and movies with support for Dolby Atmos. Enjoy high quality and immersive spatial audio.</p>
<p>When the time comes you need to hear your surroundings again, simply flip your AirPods Pro 2&nbsp; over to transparency mode. This will allow outside sounds to come in so your can stay aware of what‚Äôs around you. This is great for when stepping outside and walking through a busy street. It‚Äôs usually good to here the cars and trucks in that kind of environment for your own safety.</p>



<p>You can choose to use Adaptive Audio which is able to blend between both active noise cancellation and transparency mode seamlessly to give you the best listening experience for whatever your particular situation is.</p>
<p>The AirPods Pro 2 have been made to be able to fit any ear size. In the box, you‚Äôll find additional silicone tips marked as XS, S, M, and L. This way no matter how large or small your ears are, the AirPods Pro 2 will be able to snugly fit, staying firmly in place. This also created an acoustic seal which, in unison with active noise cancellation, keeps out the unwanted sounds.</p>

              <p>Someone definitely unplugged something they shouldn‚Äôt have. This morning the worldwide internet saw some major outages after Amazon‚Äôs AWS server farms suffered a whoopsie, taking down big-name games like <em>Fortnite</em> and&nbsp;<em>Roblox</em>, and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/roblox-and-fortnite-are-down-and-so-are-many-of-the-worlds-most-popular-games">as <em>Eurogamer</em> spotted</a>, <em>Palworld</em>, <em>Clash Royale</em> and various Nintendo online services. Most of these have since recovered.</p> <p><strong>Update:</strong> Fortnite has recovered, with multiplayer matches working once again. <a href="https://www.nintendo.co.jp/netinfo/en_US/index.html">Nintendo is also back online</a>, after both Switch and Switch 2 network services went offline for about four hours this morning.</p> <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">‚úÖ The service provider outage is resolved and Fortnite is back online! Players should again be able to log-in and matchmake without issue.</p> <p>We'll continue to monitor this to ensure service remains stable. ü´° <a href="https://t.co/5hhpG5UKfj">https://t.co/5hhpG5UKfj</a></p> <p>‚Äî Fortnite Status (@FortniteStatus) <a href="https://twitter.com/FortniteStatus/status/1980249794502082948?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 20, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <p>For fans of brainrot, it seems <em>Roblox</em> is now back online, albeit chugging a little. Er, yay?&nbsp;<a href="https://x.com/Palworld_EN/status/1980232723060211958"><em>Palworld&nbsp;</em>is also reporting that it‚Äôs back online and multiplayer is working as normal.</a></p>

 <p>However, the most serious outage is still affecting me: I cannot get&nbsp;<em>Connections</em> to run on my&nbsp;<em>New York Times</em> puzzle app, and frankly I‚Äôm struggling to cope.</p> <p>It seems the issue has taken place in Northern Virginia, <a href="https://health.aws.amazon.com/health/status">where Amazon reports</a> ‚Äúmultiple services‚Äù are down following ‚Äúincreased error rates and latencies.‚Äù This all started about four hours ago in Amazon‚Äôs US-EAST-1 region, specifically the ‚ÄúDynamoDB endpoint,‚Äù which sounds painful. The 4.26 a.m. ET update explained, ‚ÄúEngineers were immediately engaged and are actively working on both mitigating the issue, and fully understanding the root cause,‚Äù later noting that the cause was related to ‚ÄúDNS resolution‚Äù of said endpoint. Throughout the early hours of the morning, Amazon has continued to update, explaining that issues are being resolved and everything is slowly getting back online, but it‚Äôs a slow process.</p>

 <p>Given the speed with which things are being recovered, this doesn‚Äôt look like a significant attack or long-term problem, but rather yet another useful example of how just a couple of corporations now control access to the vast majority of the internet we usually take for granted.</p>

 <p><strong>Updated: 10/20/2025, 9.15 a.m. ET:</strong> The post has been updated to say that&nbsp;<em>Fortnite</em> is back online.</p> <p><strong>Updated: 10/20/2025, 9.32 a.m. ET:</strong> The post has once more been updated to report that Nintendo is now back online, and to reframe the post and headline to reflect that the issues are now mostly fixed.</p>

              <p>Halloween is a great time to catch up on some Wizarding World magic, or even better, bring your favorite moments home. Lego has quite a few Harry Potter sets for the fans out there, and right now, you can pick one up for less.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4867/">The Harry Potter Hagrid‚Äôs Hut: An Unexpected Visit set is currently going for just $47 on Amazon, after a steep 37% off its regular price of $75</a>. This is the lowest we have seen this set drop to in a long while, but the deal is going to wrap up soon. Whether you‚Äôre treating yourself to some weekend fun or introducing your kids to the classics, now‚Äôs the time to jump in.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4867/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Build Both the Insides and Outdoors</h2>
<p>This set gets you a total of 896 pieces, and it‚Äôs designed for children ages 8 and up. You will build Hagrid‚Äôs cozy hut, plus the dog house. The hut itself opens up and has a removable roof. The insides have Hagrid‚Äôs foldout chair, an umbrella stand, and even a dragon egg. There are also two collectible Hogwarts portrait tiles, which are randomly selected from a set of 14. You can display these inside Hagrid‚Äôs hut, or add them to your collection if you‚Äôre building one.</p>
<p>Mini figures include Harry Potter, Hermione Granger, Ron Weasley, Draco Malfoy, and Hagrid, along with Norbert the dragon and Hagrid‚Äôs Dog Fang. You can recreate multiple scenes; maybe have Hagrid relax on his chair inside, while the curious kids look for trouble, or have them all outside preparing to fight the unknown.</p>



<p>The set comes with a detailed instruction book that takes you through each step one by one. If that sounds too complicated, you can also download the Lego app on your phone for 3D instructions. You can also track your progress through the app to get started right where you left off.</p>
<p>Altogether, this set is a great option if you want to keep some of your favorite Harry Potter memories close. It‚Äôs not just fun to build, but also a little nostalgic, especially for those who grew up watching the movies. The mini figure selection is impressive; you‚Äôre getting most of the key characters. You could treat yourself to it, or gift it to a fellow fan this Halloween! Just be sure to grab the set fast, as we don‚Äôt expect this offer to last long. It could wrap up anytime now.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/apples-clearing-out-airtag-4-pack-before-black-friday-practically-free-at-this-price-2000636969</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/apple%E2%80%99s-clearing-out-airtag-4-pack-before-black-friday-practically-free-at-this-price.1329280/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>There are times buying in bulk is a super smart move, and then there are times when you wonder if filling your basement with 600 buckets of survivalist food was really worth the money. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3844/">This Amazon deal, thankfully, is one of the super smart moves, since it‚Äôs offering you a 4-pack of Apple AirTags for just $65</a>, just half a buck more than the all-time low price for a 4-pack. The math says that nets out to $16.25 per tracker tag, while the price of an individual AirTag at Amazon is $25 even while it‚Äôs also on sale.</p>
<p>Considering just how many uses there are for AirTags, buying just one would be a little odd to begin with. Even if you travel with just one carry-on bag, your backpack, purse, or wallet would benefit from an AirTag as well. And there are so many third-party AirTag holders available now that you can track anything from your car keys to your cat. (No, really,&nbsp;<em>your cat</em>.) Finding uses for four AirTags is a cinch.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3844/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Simply the Best</h2>
<p>If you‚Äôre an iPhone or iPad user, you absolutely cannot beat the AirTag for keeping track of your stuff. With one-tap setup, the AirTag goes from unboxing to fully running and linked to as many as five users in minutes. The disc shape and compact size mean you can put it basically anywhere, either with one of those specially designed keychains, wallets, or other holders, or just loose if you‚Äôre placing it in a suitcase or backpack.</p>
<p>When it‚Äôs time to call upon the AirTag to locate a lost item, it gets the job done whether the missing object is wedged between the couch cushions mere inches away from you, or if it‚Äôs thousands of miles away. In close range, you can use the Find My app to have the tag play a sound for you to locate, or use the app to lead you to the AirTag with accurate measurements down to the foot. At long range, the millions-strong Find My network can locate your AirTag and show its current location, even if it‚Äôs on the other side of the world.</p>



<h2>Safety All Around</h2>
<p>Not only is the ability to quickly locate a missing item a good safety feature, there‚Äôs also the fact that even the Find My network is deployed to help find your missing item, it‚Äôs done with complete anonymity. The whole network is encrypted for privacy, and the AirTags themselves never store location data or history.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3844/">This Amazon deal on a 4-pack of Apple AirTags for just $65 comes at a great time</a>, probably just as you‚Äôre thinking about or actively planning your holiday travel. It‚Äôs a great price and a small investment for the ability to track not only your own stuff, but also to help keep tabs on the family‚Äôs bags as you brave the holiday crowds.</p>
