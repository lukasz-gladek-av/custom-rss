              <p><span>The latest Steam re-release of Square Enix’s original 1997 classic </span><i><span>Final Fantasy VII </span></i><span>dropped last night on February 24, and it’s </span><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3837340/FINAL_FANTASY_VII/"><span>already sitting at</span></a><span> an “Overwhelmingly Negative” score, with only 36 percent of the 308 reviews being positive. For comparison, the previous Steam version of the game, now titled the “2013 Edition,” has a 92 percent “Overwhelmingly Positive” score. That could be this debacle’s one saving grace, but, unfortunately, Square Enix </span><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/39140/view/514107648813039662"><span>decided to delist</span></a><span> the 2013 Edition of </span><i><span>Final Fantasy VII</span></i><span> when the new version dropped last night.</span></p> <p><span>It’s somewhat difficult to sum up all of the many issues that users have reported in their Steam reviews due to the sheer number of them, but the main problems reviewers are taking issue with are stuttering sound effects, a forced launcher (that somehow registers inputs even when the game is fullscreened), buggy resolution settings (that don’t actually alter the resolution when selected), and a lack of optional filters. The lack of filters is especially ridiculous, as reviewers are reporting “blurry” visuals, and because the delisted 2013 Edition featured options for linear filtering and an “Original Graphics” mode.</span></p>

 <p><span>However, the silliest issue has, thankfully, already been patched out. Although “patched in” might be the better wording here, as several people on </span><a href="https://x.com/Zizoplays1/status/2026409178873336235?s=20"><span>X</span></a><span> reported that the original Steam depot for </span><i><span>Final Fantasy VII </span></i><span>was 0 kilobytes. That’s not an exaggeration or a joke: someone at Square Enix seemingly forgot to upload the actual contents of the game to Steam.</span></p> <p>“You guys had what… 13 years? <b>13 YEARS</b> and all the money in the world, just to add 4 features, controller support, bilinear filtering and steam cloud save files,” reads one review on Steam. “This version is a disaster avoid it all all costs,” warns another.</p>

 <p><span>On the plus side, some of the reported issues I chose to omit have been fixed. For instance, the FPS of the original release of</span><i><span> Final Fantasy VII </span></i><span>has been doubled in the new version on Steam, from 15 FPS to 30 FPS. That sounds great in theory, except that the FPS increase also resulted in animations and cutscenes playing at </span><a href="https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561197991388946/recommended/3837340/"><span>double their normal speed</span></a><span>. I can see why Square Enix chose to fix that particular issue first. Hopefully, the speed at which they rectified the issue implies that another patch is on its way soon.</span></p>

              <p>It’s beginning to feel like people have forgotten the true meaning of Next Fest. Steam’s week-long bonanza of demos once felt like a cool club to be in, indies sharing their progress on games in development and gathering wishlist clicks for forthcoming releases. This year, I’ve been bombarded with PR emails about games coming to the event since early January, and with over 3,500 demos, people are finding themselves <a href="https://kotaku.com/steam-next-fest-feb-2026-gen-ai-art-demos-2000673280">disappointed by the amount of AI slop</a> that is clogging up the pipes. But fear not, because I—your bravest hero—have trawled through the hundreds and hundreds of pages to bring you ten fantastic games you’ve likely never heard of before, and that are all totally worth your time.</p> <p>This is as eclectic a mix as I could manage, with FPSes, word puzzles, demonic farming sims, traditional platformers and text-based survival sims. There’s even a ridiculous game about mining for anachronistic guns. Check them out, and most of all, click that Wishlist button to help the developers gain attention in the utter madness that is Steam’s store.</p>

 <hr> <h2><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2647900/Seth/">Seth</a></h2>  <p>I cannot remember the last time I played an FPS that feels&nbsp;<em>this</em> good.&nbsp;<em>Seth</em> is a stage-based shooter in which you take on an arena of enemies in order to gain new abilities, more health, or points to spend between rounds, and it is a complete thrill. There are two weapons to choose from in the demo, the Fang of Anubis and the Bow of Neith, and can I please implore you to pick the latter? It’s a crossbow that briefly slows time when you aim, allowing you to pick off perfect headshots in busy crowds of furious demonic enemies, then follow up with an almighty punch to polish them off. There’s also a dash, sprinting, and sizeable jump, all at super-speed, to give that <em>Quake 3</em>-like fluidity, but in a single-player game. Love it.</p> <hr> <h2><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1778050/Mythmatch/">MythMatch</a></h2>  <p>What an extraordinary thing it can be to play multiple demos for the same game, years apart. When I first played <em>Mythmatch</em> it was a colorful, imaginative merger game based in Greek mythology, and honestly that seemed enough. But playing this enormous demo today, it has grown into so much more! This is now an amazing mix of RPG, merger puzzling and mini-challenges, with a host of mortal and godly characters to talk to and complete quests for, and it’s all just completely joyful. Even better, it’s out in just three weeks, so make sure to wishlist this one and grab it March 13.</p>

 <hr> <h2><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2190700/Altered_Alma/">Altered Alma</a></h2>  <p>Sometimes what I want is a good, solid platform action game. No intricate puzzling complexity, no bizarre twist on the format: just proper, chunky running and chopping and bouncing off walls. And that’s what the demo for <em>Altered Alma</em> offers, and how. The pixel art is lovely, the action is weighty just where I want it, and sometimes it’s good for things to be uncomplicated.</p>

 <hr> <h2><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3670630/Besmirch/">Besmirch</a></h2>  <p>In an era when every other game is a farming sim, it takes an awful lot to stand out. But wow, <em>Besmirch</em> does so, with its extraordinary combination of creepypasta weirdness and wonderful aesthetics. This is a game about staving off the hunger of a twisted, broken town—one where no one seems to be entirely right and demons come out in the dark. So water the crops, till the land, and remember to keep a crucifix on your table at night. Or get outside with a shotgun.</p> <hr> <h2><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/4044990/DEG/">DEG</a></h2> <figure id="attachment_2000673340" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000673340"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000673340">© Doseo / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p>It’s always a good sign when I realize that I’ve been playing one demo for far too long, firstly because it means I’m having a great time, and secondly because that’s one generous demo! That was my experience with <em>DEG</em>, a logic puzzle game that’s a cross between picross, Slitherlink and Pic-a-Pic. Which, if those words mean nothing to you, is a very good thing. It’s brilliantly put together, asking you to figure out its rules by trial and error, getting more interesting and involved the more you play. I cannot wait for this to be finished. (There’s no YouTube trailer, but <a href="https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1Pzx6zuEUJ/?spm_id_from=333.1387.homepage.video_card.click">you can watch it on BiliBili</a>.)</p>

 <hr> <h2><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3756940/The_Ratline/">The Ratline</a></h2>  <p>The latest game from Owlskip, the small indie team that invented the genre&nbsp;<em>Roottrees&nbsp;</em>got rich from, is&nbsp;<em>The Ratline</em>. You play as a detective in 1971, expert at identifying hiding suspects, and recruited by a mysterious figure to help catch escaped Nazis who have never faced justice! These war criminals are living under assumed identities around the world, and you need to piece together evidence and clues to figure out their new names and locations. You can start catching Nazis in the demo, and the full game comes out March 17.</p> <hr> <h2><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/4239730/Spellsy_Demo/">Spellsy</a></h2>  <p>I’m currently running a 77-day streak on the completely splendid&nbsp;<a href="https://squaredle.app/"><em>Squaredle</em></a>, and&nbsp;<em>Spellsy</em> takes that same concept of finding words by dragging a line through a grid of letters, but adds an extra dimension of complexity: each letter tile needs to be used a certain number of times to be destroyed, and you have to clear the grid with the fewest three-letter words possible. It requires a remarkable amount of planning and skill, and this demo has a&nbsp;<em>very</em> generous number of puzzles to play.</p> <hr> <h2><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3934080/Dig_For_Riches/">Dig for Riches</a></h2>  <p>If you were lucky enough to be part of last year’s idiotic phenomenon that was&nbsp;<a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3244220/A_Game_About_Digging_A_Hole/"><em>A Game About Digging a Hole</em></a>, then do I have the game for you.&nbsp;<em>Dig for Riches</em> is a blatant rip-off/evolution of the idea, in which instead of digging up a back yard, you’re mining in the Old West. Except, um, you’re mining for guns? Anachronistic guns that shouldn’t be invented yet. But that’s a small concern after you unlock the cell phone. It’s all extremely silly, with a pleasingly fast loop, plenty to unlock and upgrade, and the sheer stupidity of putting soil-covered guns in a wheelbarrow for profit.</p>

 <hr> <h2><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3823370/Beyond_Words/">Beyond Words</a></h2>  <p>It’s a bold move to promote your game as “from the legendary developers” of something, but in this case it’s well-earned as it refers to Rare’s David Doak and Steve Ellis, leads on <em>TimeSplitters</em><em>&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>GoldenEye</em>. So what manner of first-person action game are they bringing us? Oh, it’s single-player Scrabble.</p> <p>But it’s&nbsp;<em>good</em> single-player Scrabble! It’s actually a lot more complex than that, and while it’s very much based on the traditional tiles of the board game, this is much more about stringing together ridiculously high scores boosted by bonus cards bought between rounds, on elaborate boards covered in all sorts of special markers.</p>

 <hr> <h2><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3435110/Dont_Freeze_A_Winter_Card_Survival/">Don’t Freeze</a></h2>  <p>This is such a neat idea, so impressively delivered. It’s a survival game, kinda like&nbsp;<em>The Long Dark</em>, except it’s played almost entirely in text. Rather than a first-person world to explore, instead you’re moving cards between locations and your backpack, managing your food, drink, warmth and sanity through meters, and crafting from the loot you discover when “exploring” in different locations.</p> <p>After spending ages with the demo, now as I write I’m recalling the game’s world as if it had had fancy graphics. Turns out my imagination has excellent ray tracing, and very realistic shadows.</p>

              <p><span>I’ve been an avid anime watcher for longer than I’d care to publicly admit. And yet, even with those dozen-plus years of seasonal anime consumption under my belt, I don’t think I’ve seen a stronger seasonal line-up than the current winter 2026 cour. You’ve got your obvious bangers, such as</span><i><span> Frieren: Beyond Journey’s End</span></i><span> and </span><i><span>Jujutsu Kaisen</span></i><span>, but there are at least twenty weekly releases currently airing that are worth watching. </span><i><span>Hell’s Paradise</span></i><span>, </span><i><span>Fate/Strange Fake</span></i><span>, </span><i><span>Oshi no Ko</span></i><span>, </span><i><span>Sentenced to Be a Hero</span></i><span>, </span><i><span>My Hero Academia: Vigilantes</span></i><span>, </span><i><span>Trigun Stargaze</span></i><span>, </span><i><span>Golden Kamuy</span></i><span>– I could go on, and that’s without including the stuff that just finished airing, such as </span><i><span>Spy x Family</span></i><span> and </span><i><span>To Your Eternity</span></i><span>.</span></p> <p><span>Now, I’m not complaining, but the dedicated anime fans among you may have noticed an issue with the majority of the shows I just spent the better part of a paragraph listing: they’re almost exclusively returning series. That’s par for the course as far as the industry is concerned, as the manga series they’re adapted from have a tendency to go on for hundreds if not thousands of chapters. My worry here is that the overabundance of returning series this season might be overwhelming for folks who have other hobbies or social lives, which doesn’t exactly leave much room for trying out something new. That’s why this impassioned plea disguised as an article exists, because I don’t want any of you to miss out on </span><i><span>Ikoku Nikki</span></i><span> (and, more importantly, because I need it to be renewed for a second season).</span></p>

  <p><i><span>Ikoku Nikki</span></i><span>, known as </span><i><span>Journal with Witch</span></i><span> in English, is referred to as a “josei” manga in Japan. That quite literally translates to “women’s comic” or “lady comic,” but, in much the same way that the “shōnen” manga tag (meaning “boy comic”) can come across as a little reductive sometimes, I can’t help but feel like it’s doing </span><i><span>Ikoku Nikki</span></i><span> a disservice. At a glance, maybe the genre tag does fit, considering it features two female protagonists and one of its primary themes is the exploration of motherhood. However, as far as I’m concerned, that would be akin to referring to </span><i><span>Heated Rivalry</span></i><span> as just a “sports” show, because </span><i><span>Ikoku Nikki</span></i><span> should appeal to everyone. Perhaps this mislabelling stems from the topics explored beyond its introductory episode, although, saying that, I’m getting slightly ahead of myself here.</span></p> <p><span>Ironically, in giving you the narrative setup, I’ll have to be reductive myself for a moment, so as not to spoil things for you. </span><i><span>Ikoku Nikki </span></i><span>opens with the death of Makio Kōdai’s sister and brother-in-law. Makio’s apathetic reaction to the news is immediately contradicted by her vehement, borderline forceful request to take in her orphaned fifteen-year-old niece, Asa. While this might seem like the framework of a story that primarily focuses on grief, which it still partially is, it’s actually an excuse to tell a story about something more obscure: conflicting personalities.</span></p>

 <p><span>Makio is reserved, to put it lightly. She’s a borderline shut-in who forces herself to interact with people only when necessary. Asa is sociable, bright, inquisitive, and very, very talkative. That last trait promptly becomes a point of contention between the two, as Makio refuses to tell Asa why she detests her deceased sister. Without spoiling too much, even though I believe this should be apparent from the very first episode, it’s immediately clear that Makio is on the spectrum. The fanbase believes she’s autistic, but, to me, she specifically presents as AuDHD; the informally named combination of someone with both ADHD and autism.</span></p>

 <p><span>American media has a terrible history of portraying those with autism or ADHD incorrectly at best, or offensively at worst. </span><i><span>The Big Bang Theory</span></i><span>, </span><i><span>Rain Man</span></i><span>, </span><i><span>The Good Doctor</span></i><span>, and </span><i><span>Music</span></i><span>: all of these portray neurodivergent people as savants, unfeeling robots, or over-exaggerated stereotypes. Makio is none of these things. She’s a refreshing, honestly portrayed mess. She can hold a conversation and does her best </span><a href="https://www.autism.org.uk/advice-and-guidance/behaviour/masking"><span>to mask</span></a><span>, but she just prefers being alone. She can look after herself and even Asa, but sometimes gets hyper-focused on tasks for too long. She’s a brilliant, well-regarded writer, but it’s not a superpower; it’s a skill she’s learned and cultivated, and still a craft she struggles to perfect. Makio is easily one of the best examples of a neurodivergent character I’ve ever seen, and part of why this portrayal succeeds is the narrative excuse </span><i><span>Ikoku Nikki</span></i><span> uses to explore her character: Asa.</span></p> <p><span>In the same way that Makio feels like a true portrayal of someone on the spectrum, Asa is written as a faithful, honest representation of a neurotypical high school student. She’s not some honor student or an underachiever, and she’s not the most popular kid in school or a friendless delinquent either. Asa is an ordinary young girl with interests and desires, whose life has been upended by an unprecedented loss. She feels real. She feels authentic in a way that no other teenager in modern media has in recent memory, reminding me of my nieces and my friends’ kids. Asa’s efforts to understand Makio, and vice versa, wouldn’t work if these characters weren’t written with care and in such great detail. It also definitely helps that Miyuki Sawashiro and Fuko Mori, Makio and Asa’s respective voice actors, are giving the best performances this side of the winter 2026 anime schedule (a statement I don’t make lightly, considering the talent they’re up against).</span></p>

 <p><span>And all of this is simply what I can tell you without spoiling things. I could go into great detail about </span><i><span>Ikoku Nikki’s</span></i><span> incredible portrayal of men’s mental health, its deft deconstruction of motherhood, its gentle, honest depiction of asexuality, and just how goddamn cool Shingo Kasamachi is. Honestly, calling this a josei anime feels extra ridiculous whenever the story chooses to focus on Shingo, because that is the man I’m visualizing becoming when I look at myself in the mirror.</span></p> <p><span>Trust me when I say I get it; I get why </span><i><span>Frieren </span></i><span>and</span><i><span> Jujutsu Kaisen</span></i><span> are at the top of the anime charts every week. They’re brilliant, and I’m just as excited as everyone else when Thursday and Friday roll around. I’m just always slightly more excited for Sunday at the moment, which is why I hope I’ve done a decent job of convincing you to fit </span><i><span>Ikoku Nikki</span></i><span> day into your already packed anime schedule, because I will never forgive you all if the best anime of winter 2026 ends on an unrenewed cliffhanger.</span></p>
