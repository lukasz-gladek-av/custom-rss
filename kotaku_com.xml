If they were shooting a scene at the home of Mark’s sister and her husband for the first episode, they would also shoot Mark’s cliffhanger moment when he yells “She’s alive!” around the same time. That piecemeal style of filming wasn’t the only quirky directing choice made by Stiller, who reveals on the podcast that he originally was going to shoot the entire finale from the Innies’ perspective on the outside.</p><p>“I always imagined it was going to be totally different, visually, than the rest of the show because everything is very set and ordered; not a lot of handheld [cameras], if any. But, for episode nine, we were like, ‘We’re going to use Steadicam the whole time, and it’s going to be flowing because we want to be in the point of view of these characters.”</p><p>That would mean instead of watching Innie Mark (Adam Scott) try to visibly squirm his way out of talking with a Harmony Cobel (Patricia Arquette) who’s suspicious of whether she’s actually talking to Outie Mark, we would have been staring directly into Arquette’s judgemental eyes as Mark stammered along. As enjoyably immersive as that would’ve been, it would’ve taken away from scenes like Mark’s punctuating ”She’s alive!” moment, which carries an extra emotional weight thanks to Mark’s shocked look. This is a fact Stiller thankfully realized. </p><p>“It can’t be in their point of view the whole time because then we’ll never see them.”</p><p>The second season of <em>The Severance Podcast with Ben Stiller and Adam Scott </em>debuts tomorrow, right after the Season 2 premiere is released. They’ll be breaking down all the nuances of the second season so we can better make sense of the mindfuck we’ll be embarking on for the next 10 weeks.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

If you see any website, social media account, or app claiming you can pre-order the Switch 2, it’s a scam, and I’d stay far away from any of those links. Now, for some good news: We probably know when Switch 2 pre-orders will go live. </p><h2 id="h79"><a id=""></a>When Switch 2 pre-orders will (likely) go live</h2><p>At the end of the new Switch 2 trailer, the company confirmed it would have a <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/nintendo-switch-2-gallery-differences-comparison-joycon-1851740928&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/nintendo-switch-2-gallery-differences-comparison-joycon-1851740928">Nintendo Switch 2</a></span>-focused Direct later this year. Specifically, the Nintendo Direct will arrive on April 2. And this is likely the date when pre-orders will go live in most territories. </p><p>It makes sense that Nintendo would wait to start taking pre-orders until it has shown more games and revealed more info on the upcoming console’s price and launch date. So I’d expect the Direct in April to end with an “And pre-orders go live later today!” announcement, or at the very least a confirmation of when to expect them to go live. </p><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://x.com/Wario64/status/1879890176786239826&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://x.com/Wario64/status/1879890176786239826" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">At the moment, as spotted by Wario64</a></span>, Best Buy is letting people sign up to be notified when pre-orders are live on the retailer’s site. I’m not sure you need to do that. Every website and social media account dedicated to games will post about Switch 2 pre-orders the moment they are available. But if you want to be super-duper sure you have a chance to pre-order Nintendo’s next home console, signing up for a Best Buy email notification won’t hurt.</p><h2 id="h80"><a id=""></a>When will the Switch 2 launch? </h2><p>Officially, the only thing Nintendo has confirmed about the Switch 2 launch is that it will be in 2025. However, the company also announced at the end of the Switch 2 trailer that it will be holding <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/nintendo-switch-2-experience-early-play-la-nyc-dallas-1851740842&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/nintendo-switch-2-experience-early-play-la-nyc-dallas-1851740842">hands-on experiences</a></span> around the globe ahead of the console’s launch. And we can look at those dates to help us pinpoint a possible timeframe for launch. </p><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.nintendo.com/us/nintendo-switch-2-experience/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/nintendo-switch-2-experience/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">According to Nintendo’s website</a></span>, New York City will be the first place in the world where you’ll be able to go hands-on with a Switch 2. That starts in April. Then there are a bunch of other cities around the world that will also get a chance to check out the device.</p><p> Currently, Nintendo has a demo event in Seoul, South Korea planned for May 31-June 1. That’s the farthest-out date confirmed. One would assume that Nintendo isn’t going to be doing hands-on demo events after the console’s release, so we can probably assume the earliest possible launch month for the Switch 2 is June. My bet is for July or even August. That gives Nintendo time to squeeze in a few more events if it wants, and gives the company enough time to market the hell out of the Switch 2 between now and then. </p><p>We’ll update this post as we learn more about the price, release date, and pre-order times for Switch 2. </p><p> .<br></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Nintendo didn’t reveal a title, but fans are already calling the kart racer <em>Mario Kart 9</em> and scanning every frame of footage we got from the announcement trailer. We’ve gathered a few of those observations fans have made about elements that stick out in the brief glimpse we’ve gotten of the new game. Here are some of the details you might’ve missed in the new <em>Mario Kart </em>trailer.</p></div></div><div><p>We didn’t get a great look at all the characters, as much of the trailer focuses on the fireball-slinging plumber himself, but what we can see makes it look like some of Mario’s friends have gotten a makeover. Donkey Kong is the most immediate example, as he now looks closer to his <em>Super Mario Bros. Movie </em>incarnation than to his <em>Mario Kart 8 </em>model. Meanwhile, everyone seems a little bit more squished, like they appear in <em>Super Mario Bros. Wonder</em>.</p></div><div><p>There’s a shot in the trailer of what looks like 24 total starting points on a race track. This implies the next <em>Mario Kart </em>may include races of up to 24 players at a time. This is double the 12-player races of <em>Mario Kart 8</em>, and probably accounts for some of the larger tracks players have noticed. However, some also speculate the game might have some kind of open-world exploration element similar to games like <em>Crash Team Racing</em>.</p></div><div><p>Rosalina is returning as a playable character this time around, and her kart looks a little bit different than everyone else’s. Fans pointed out her ride looks like a snowmobile rather than the wheel-sporting vehicles of most other characters. This isn’t a first for the series, but many fans probably haven’t played the mobile game <em>Mario Kart Tour</em> where they were introduced.</p></div><div><p>At one point in the trailer you can see a burger stand that is seemingly run by Yoshi? Or is Yoshi the meat? I’m suddenly left with more questions than answers about this establishment. But fans realized the burger joint is actually shaped like Yoshi. Its windows are his eyes and the top bun covering the entrance is his snout. It’s cute!</p></div><div><p>Yoshi has a burger stand of some kind, but in keeping with a long series tradition, there’s also branding seen in the trailer that references other characters and entities. There’s a brief shot where you can see the logo for Morton’s Construction, a reference to one of the Koopalings, and you can see logos for sponsors on the tracks like Luigi Tires, Mario Motors, Mario Kart TV, and 1-Up Fuel. </p><hr><p>Those are just a few of the details folks are pointing out, and there will no doubt be more discoveries as <em>Mario </em>sickos comb through the trailer. Beyond that, we’ll more than likely hear more about the next <em>Mario Kart </em>in April when Nintendo holds its Switch 2 Direct <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/nintendo-direct-switch-2-release-date-april-2025-1851740848&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/nintendo-direct-switch-2-release-date-april-2025-1851740848">on April 2</a></span>.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

For four seasons of Netflix’s stalker drama <em>You, </em>Joe Goldberg (Penn Badgley) has cheated death (and a few love interests) enough to warrant him being eliminated from existence forever, and the final season looks like it’s going to do just that. Today, Netflix put us all out of our misery by finally announcing the release date for the final season of <em>You</em>, while also offering some  hints about Joe’s potential fate.</p><p>The final season of <em>You </em>will release on April 24, a little under 5 1/2 years after the series made its way over to Netflix from its original home,&nbsp;<em>Lifetime</em>. The teaser recaps Joe’s litany of victims while the lovestruck sicko narrates about the trail of blood, bodies, and broken hearts that led him to where he was always meant to be. He eerily remarks that some anonymous “you” is the one constant throughout the years while lovingly caressing the glass case he’s imprisoned numerous people in over the last four seasons. Is he talking to his torture chamber? Is he talking to his latest love interest?

The logline for the seasons says Joe is returning to New York after spending Season 4 in London, but “his perfect life is threatened by the ghosts of his past and his own dark desires.” His life being threatened isn’t new to a guy who was almost killed on the kitchen floor by the mother of his child, but there are more allusions to his time being up. In addition to providing the release date and the teaser trailer, Netflix also gifts us with the poster for the final season, which sees Joe stomach-deep in water inside the glass case with the words “To The Last Breath” above his head.</p><figure id="" data-id="1867a15561cda75fc0fec0c3aaf1a15d" data-recommend-id="image://1867a15561cda75fc0fec0c3aaf1a15d" data-format="jpg" data-width="1500" data-height="2222" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Joe Goldberg standing in water" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Joe Goldberg standing in water" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Netflix</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="1867a15561cda75fc0fec0c3aaf1a15d" data-recommend-id="image://1867a15561cda75fc0fec0c3aaf1a15d" data-format="jpg" data-width="1500" data-height="2222" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Joe Goldberg standing in water" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>If you need any more convincing that this is the end for Joe, he concludes the teaser inside of the glass case by looking directly into our souls and saying, “Goodbye, you.” We’ll check back on April 24 to see how Netflix decides to wrap up one of the creepiest stories in its collection. </p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

So that’s my theory, and the PlayStation team respects his wish.”</p><p>Yoshida reiterated that this wasn’t secret information but just his own guess as to why FromSoftware and Sony have never moved forward with anything related to the franchise, even a potential remake by another studio like Bluepoint Games. It previously produced the well-received <em>Shadow of the Colossus</em> and <em>Demon’s Souls</em> remakes, and was at one point rumored to be working on something related to <em>Bloodborne </em>before later leaks suggested it was actually working on an original IP. </p><p>We don’t know exactly what Miyazaki and FromSoftware are working on at the moment. A separate team within the studio is shipping 2025's <em>Elden Ring</em> spin-off, <em>Nighreign</em>. The director recently said other teams within the studio would be focusing on new projects in different genres. Sony is now the largest single shareholder in FromSoftware’s parent company, Kadokawa Corporation. Who knows, maybe <em>Bloodborne 2</em> will be a launch game for the PS6. </p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
