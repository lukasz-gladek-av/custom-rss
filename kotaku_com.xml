Should you have enough, you can buy weapons and armor—often a level or two ahead of your own—to bolster your power. So it’s worth checking in to see what they have in stock.</li><li><strong>Quests</strong>: Most quests in the game—side and main—reward you with XP and equipment upon completion.

Her defensive Ultimate helps your team and hurts your enemies at the same time with only one real weakness, and her healing primary attack has limited aim assist. She’s a great healer to get started with. Cloak, on the other hand, is somewhat similar to Scarlet Witch, who is a Duelist. He has a mid-range attack that deals steady damage, but he can also debuff enemies, reducing their visibility, dealing damage, and causing them to take more damage for a time. He also has an ability that grants invincibility for a few seconds. </p><p>Since you can instantly switch between them, fans of both healing and damaging will find a lot to love about this pair.</p><h2 id="h139202"><a id="play"></a>How should you play Cloak &amp; Dagger?</h2><p>Dagger is a very approachable healer since you don’t need to have great aim to heal well with her Lightforce Daggers bounce and bend towards allies and enemies.</p><figure id="" data-id="d1e120d8278e468628dde992eef37beb" data-recommend-id="image://d1e120d8278e468628dde992eef37beb" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Dagger attacks enemies." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Dagger attacks enemies." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Marvel Games / Brian Barnett / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="d1e120d8278e468628dde992eef37beb" data-recommend-id="image://d1e120d8278e468628dde992eef37beb" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Dagger attacks enemies." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>In spite of this, there is still skill required to play her and her comrade to their maximum potential—and much of that involves how much time you spend playing as Cloak.

Switching to Cloak and back again will reload Lightforce Dagger slightly faster than the standard reload animation.</li><li><strong>Light Explosion:</strong> Throw a large rectangle of light towards your target, healing them a slight amount and boosting subsequent healing they receive. Use this on enemies who are getting hurt a lot before using Lightforce Dagger or Dagger Storm on them.</li><li><strong>Dagger Storm:</strong> Throw a ball of light that expands into a dome, healing all allies within it over time.

A great way to strike back at enemies trying to take Dagger out.</li><li><strong>Eternal Bond (Ultimate):</strong> Same as Dagger’s. Four dashes, each aimable, lay down a Light/Dark power on the ground, damaging all enemies and healing all allies standing on it. A very powerful Ultimate ability, and one which charges very quickly. Be aware that enemies like Magneto can kill you in-between dashes, so try to have a teammate like Punisher or Star Lord bait it out before you use this, or have a Loki on your team to have two Eternal Bonds.</li><li><strong>Light’s Embrace:</strong> Switches to Dagger.</li><li><strong>Terror Cape: </strong>Throws a rectangle of dark energy in the direction you are aiming, significantly reducing visibility for enemies struck with it. Also deals damage and makes them Vulnerable, making them take more damage from all sources for a time. Use this every 12 seconds, when it comes off cooldown, against the most vulnerable targets on the enemy team.</li><li><strong>Dark Teleportation: </strong>Causes yourself, and nearby allies, to become invisible, untargetable, and quicker movement speed. A well-timed Dark Teleportation can completely negate certain enemy Ultimate abilities. Iron Man shooting his ultimate at your team? Switch to Cloak and use this ability, and you’ll take no damage. It only lasts a moment, so your timing will need to be precise.</li><li><strong>From Shadow To Light (Team-Up: Passive): </strong>Teaming up with Moon Knight will give him the ability to create a sphere of invisibility for himself.</li></ul><hr><p>With all these tips in hand, you are prepared to become a true master of both light and dark. Good luck!</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Nine of those homers happened in one game. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://sports.yahoo.com/mlb/article/yankees-hit-historic-9-home-runs-including-3-from-aaron-judge-and-3-off-games-first-3-pitches-to-crush-brewers-174733967.html&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://sports.yahoo.com/mlb/article/yankees-hit-historic-9-home-runs-including-3-from-aaron-judge-and-3-off-games-first-3-pitches-to-crush-brewers-174733967.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Three of them happened off the first three pitches of Saturday’s game</a></span> against the Milwaukee Brewers. But nobody seems to be talking about how great the Yankees performed over the weekend; instead the conversation is entirely focused on the weird “Torpedo” bats used by some Yankee players like shortstop Anthony Volpe, who hit two home runs over the weekend. </p><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://sports.yahoo.com/mlb/article/did-yankees-physicist-designed-torpedo-bats-play-role-in-9-hr-power-surge-vs-brewers-224436396.html&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://sports.yahoo.com/mlb/article/did-yankees-physicist-designed-torpedo-bats-play-role-in-9-hr-power-surge-vs-brewers-224436396.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Torpedo bats</a></span> look very strange when compared to the standard tube-like design of most professional baseball bats. The <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://x.com/search?q=torpedo%20bat&amp;src=typed_query&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://x.com/search?q=torpedo%20bat&amp;src=typed_query" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Torpedo bats</a></span> feature a large, abnormal and bloated “sweet spot” in a position where players are more likely to make contact with the baseball. This tumor-like spot looks odd, but it has more mass and, the theory is, that leads to harder hits and more home runs. And so far, the bat seems to be legal based on the MLB’s rules. </p><p>“The concept makes so much sense,” said  Volpe before Sunday’s game. “I know I’m bought in. The bigger you can have the barrel where you hit the ball, it makes sense to me.”</p><p>Three other Yankee players as well as two other MLB pro players used the strange bat over the weekend, too. Yet not all of them hit multiple home runs. Meanwhile, Yankee player Aaron Judge was able to hit six homers over opening weekend without using the new bats. </p><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://sports.yahoo.com/mlb/article/whats-the-deal-with-the-yankees-torpedo-bats-and-are-they-really-a-competitive-advantage-000747259.html&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://sports.yahoo.com/mlb/article/whats-the-deal-with-the-yankees-torpedo-bats-and-are-they-really-a-competitive-advantage-000747259.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">As reported by <em>Yahoo Sports</em></a></span>, when asked about the new bats, Judge said: “What I did the past couple of seasons speaks for itself. Why try to change something if you have something that’s working?”</p><h2 id="h568887"><a id=""></a>Reactions to the new Torpedo bats</h2><p>Still, the Yankees hitting so many home runs while using strange new bats has ruffled some feathers, in a sport that is filled with tradition and is slow to change. At least one player for the Brewers, Trevor Megill, wasn’t happy about the opposing team using Torpedo bats over the weekend. </p><p>“I think it’s terrible,’’ <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://nypost.com/2025/03/30/sports/brewers-closer-fumes-over-yankees-new-bowling-pin-bats/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://nypost.com/2025/03/30/sports/brewers-closer-fumes-over-yankees-new-bowling-pin-bats/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Megill told the <em>New York Post</em></a></span>. “We’ll see what the data says. I’ve never seen anything like it before. I feel like it’s something used in slow-pitch softball. It’s genius: Put the mass all in one spot. It might be bush [league]. It might not be. But it’s the Yankees, so they’ll let it slide.” </p><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://sports.yahoo.com/mlb/article/mlb-reactions-to-yankees-torpedo-bats-range-from-its-terrible-to-they-should-send-a-few-over-here-044054221.html&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://sports.yahoo.com/mlb/article/mlb-reactions-to-yankees-torpedo-bats-range-from-its-terrible-to-they-should-send-a-few-over-here-044054221.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Other players were more open to the new bat design</a></span> or suggested it might not work for everyone. </p><p>It should be noted that other teams besides the Yankees used the new bats over the weekend, and there’s some evidence that they’ve been around since last season. What makes things confusing is that the Torpedo bat isn’t a singular design, but more a new way to build bats where you place more mass in a specific spot. There’s also some debate as to how helpful they are and if they really provide a massive advantage. It still takes a lot of skill to swing a bat fast and accurately enough to hit a home run against MLB’s skilled pitchers.</p><p> Still, in a sport where even a slim advantage can be very important, that hasn’t stopped teams from taking notice. <em>Yahoo Sports</em> reports that after opening weekend, 29 other teams are now looking to optimize their own equipment to create their own Torpedo bats. </p><p> . </p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
