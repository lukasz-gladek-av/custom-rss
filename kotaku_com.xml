These showings will encourage fans to “get loose” and sing and cheer as much as they want. The “Block Party” screenings will take place on Friday. Here’s how WB described them: </p><blockquote data-type="BlockQuote"><p>Warner Bros. Pictures and Legendary Pictures invite fans back to the theater to experience <em>A Minecraft Movie</em> together in a whole new way! You know the moments. You know the lines. You love the songs! Now it’s time to get loose, laugh out loud and belt out those lyrics like a true diamond-tier fan.</p></blockquote><p>It should be noted that WB isn’t telling fans to toss popcorn around or destroy the theaters where the movie is being shown. It’s just providing people with some showings where you’ll be free to scream, yell, cheer, laugh, talk, and dance around as much as you want. So please, don’t throw food around and be a real piece of shit, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/minecraft-movie-director-chicken-jockey-popcorn-cops-1851775832&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/minecraft-movie-director-chicken-jockey-popcorn-cops-1851775832">even if the director behind the hit live-action game adaptation thinks its really hilarious</a></span>. </p><p>Honestly, dancing around a movie theater for a bit with friends sounds a lot better than the actual movie, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/minecraft-movie-review-bad-jack-black-kids-movie-steve-1851775345&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/minecraft-movie-review-bad-jack-black-kids-movie-steve-1851775345">which is mostly clips of Jack Black in a CG world overacting</a></span> while nothing really happens for an hour. </p><p>The other reason WB is doing these “Block Party” showings is likely in an effort to help <em>Minecraft </em>stick around in theaters for a bit longer as it faces tough competition from <em>Sinners </em>and big upcoming summer movies like <em>Thunderbolts</em>. </p><p>As of April 28, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/minecraft-movie-unfinished-cgi-jack-black-leak-screens-1851774855&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/minecraft-movie-unfinished-cgi-jack-black-leak-screens-1851774855"><em>A Minecraft Movie</em></a></span> has brought in over <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.boxofficemojo.com/release/rl746096129/weekend/?ref_=bo_rl_tab#tabs&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.boxofficemojo.com/release/rl746096129/weekend/?ref_=bo_rl_tab#tabs" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">$800 million at the box office</a></span> and could end up crossing the billion-dollar mark (or getting really close) in a few weeks. So these special “rowdy” screenings of the <em>Minecraft</em> movie might help WB eke out a few  million more dollars over the upcoming weekend.</p><p> .<br></p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

It now seems all but inevitable that <em>Dragon Ball: Sparking Zero</em>, one of the biggest games of last year, will arrive on Switch 2 in its first 12 months. </p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="195502" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="The Most Sought After Elden Ring Sword Has A Storied History" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="307" data-playlist="195502,195624,194842" data-current="195502"><div><p>The Most Sought After Elden Ring Sword Has A Storied History</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195502/195502_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195502/195502_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195502/195502_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195502/195502_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/20979.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>Bandai Namco’s arena fighting game<span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://x.com/Gmedia_Games/status/1916885125939216690&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://x.com/Gmedia_Games/status/1916885125939216690" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"> was recently rated for the upcoming hardware</a></span> by the Saudi Arabia ratings board (General Authority of Media Regulation), <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/GamingLeaksAndRumours/comments/1ka0dkg/nintendo_switch_2_version_of_dragonball_sparking/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GamingLeaksAndRumours/comments/1ka0dkg/nintendo_switch_2_version_of_dragonball_sparking/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">as spotted</a></span> by the Gaming Leaks and Rumors subreddit. While not officially announced, it’s all but a slam dunk now that <em>Dragon Ball: Sparking Zero</em> will arrive on Switch 2, likely some time before the end of 2025. </p><p>The game came to PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC last fall with fun cinematic tag-team fights that mostly made up for its lackluster single-player  offerings. Especially notable was that local couch co-op battles were limited to a single stage. There was also a fair amount of debate around the character balancing for online competitive play, something the series hasn’t traditionally been known for but which more players expect in the modern world of ranked leaderboards. </p><p>While <em>Dragon Ball: Sparking Zero</em> is currently playable on Steam Deck, it remains to be seen how much performance it can squeeze out of the Switch 2. I have a hard time imagining it will  push beyond 30fps, but the cel-shaded art style might hold up surprisingly well in handheld mode. It would be extra neat if the Switch 2 version had special motion control options, harkening back to <em>Tenkaichi 3</em> on Wii, though I’m not holding my breath.</p><p>The game has been getting a steady stream of DLC since it released, with its first set of <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ut2y8gAv3aY&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ut2y8gAv3aY" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Daima characters joining the fighting roster last week</a></span>. Hopefully, some or all of the existing DLC is part of the day-one package when <em>Sparking Zero</em> arrives on Switch 2. </p><p>.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
