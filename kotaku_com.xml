Apple TV’s workplace comedy starring Rob McElhenney and Charlotte Nicdao about a video game studio and its lovable but emotionally stunted staff returns for another raft of episodes in January.

Otherwise, we still don’t have a trailer or even a real synopsis of what season 4 proper will entail. I assume it will be the usual mix of dueling egos and knowing video game dunks, but hopefully there’s some more trenchant, contemporary criticism mixed in. <em>Mythic Quest </em><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/what-we-loved-and-hated-about-mythic-quest-a-tv-show-a-1841365855&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/what-we-loved-and-hated-about-mythic-quest-a-tv-show-a-1841365855">still has one of the best jokes</a></span> about gaming ever made. </p><p>For those who haven’t yet taken the plunge on Apple’s video-game-flavored riff on shows like <em>Community</em>, it’s about the charming but dysfunctional studio behind a hit MMORPG in the mold of <em>World of Warcraft</em> and the ways they self-sabotage one another while working through their personal foibles and attempting to grow past their character flaws. It’s a perfect example of Apple TV’s narrow, lowkey success with original programming that is very good and almost nobody is watching. People can start remedying that in the meantime by catching up on seasons 1-3. </p><p>.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Instead, the team’s goal is to remaster the entire game and every asset in it. And so far, it’s looking really good. </p><p>In a new behind-the-scenes trailer released on November 14, Nvidia sat down with some of the modders working on<em> Half-Life 2 RTX </em>and let them talk about why they are remastering this game and what it means to them 20 years later. (Yeah, <em>Half-Life 2</em> turns 20 on November 16.) And in the new trailer, we see a lot of <em>HL2 RTX</em> in action and it looks phenomenal. </p><p>The team’s goal isn’t to change how <em>Half-Life 2</em> plays, but instead to add a new coat of paint to the old shooter to make it look better than ever. This means remaking many props and assets to be higher quality, replacing textures with new ones that react properly to lights, and much, much more. It’s honestly one of the best looking remasters I’ve ever seen. </p><p>Nvidia says <em>Half-Life 2 RTX </em>is still in early development, so no idea when we’ll get a chance to play this mod. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://store.steampowered.com/app/2477290/HalfLife_2_RTX/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2477290/HalfLife_2_RTX/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">You can now find a new Steam page</a></span> for the mod on Valve’s storefront, which shows that while Valve isn’t officially involved, they are cool with the project. (<span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.eurogamer.net/valve-gives-black-mesa-permission-to-be-a-commercial-product&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/valve-gives-black-mesa-permission-to-be-a-commercial-product" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Which isn’t surprising at all</a></span>.) </p><p>Now, if you’ll excuse me, I’m going to watch that trailer again and dream of playing <em>HL2 RTX </em>while trying to not think about how old the game is in 2024. </p><p> .<br></p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
