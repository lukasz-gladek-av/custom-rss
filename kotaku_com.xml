              <p>Professional blowouts at a high-end salon easily run $60 to $100 per session and if you’re getting your hair done weekly, that’s thousands of dollars annually for results that last just a few days. Dyson just dropped the <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4621/">Supersonic Origin hair dryer to $299 on Amazon, slashed from its usual $419 price</a>, and at this all-time low, you’re paying the equivalent of three to five salon visits for a tool that delivers the same professional-grade results at home for years to come.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4621/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<p>This isn’t your average drugstore hair dryer: The Supersonic <strong>packs Dyson’s digital motor V9 that spins at 110,000 RPM</strong>, <strong>intelligent heat control</strong> that measures air temperature 40 times per second, and <strong>Air Multiplier technology</strong> that amplifies airflow by three times.</p>
<h2>Changes the Way You Dry Your Hair</h2>
<p>The key motor element of the Supersonic is Dyson’s digital motor V9: This motor is a brushless DC motor which is much smaller and more lightweight than traditional hair dryer motors. Typical conventional dryers place the motor in the foundation of the unit but Dyson relocated this motor to the handle of its unit. The motor’s speed of 110,000 RPM has more than just show value: This speed powers an impeller which draws air into its chambers. The motor pulls this air into its chambers at a rate of 13 liters of air every second.</p>



<p>The Air Multiplier technology is taken from Dyson’s bladeless fans. The function of this technology is the <strong>induction of air from the motor and then amplifying it through a carefully created hole</strong>. This amplifies the air into a <strong>three times more powerful jet of air</strong> than the motor’s capability, but this air comes from a smooth airflow. For this reason, it becomes capable of drying your hair sections quickly without releasing it all over the place.</p>



<p>The area where the Dyson Supersonic differs from more affordable models is heat control: The unit comes equipped with a glass bead thermistor sensor located in the airflow that t<strong>racks the temperature of the air up to 40 times every second</strong>. This information is then used by the microprocessor to make adjustments on the fly to ensure it does not reach unsafe levels. High temperatures damage hair by breaking down the protein bonds which makes it brittle, dry, and easy to break. The problem with most conventional dryers is that it can often reach temperatures above 300°F which is damaging enough on its own: The <strong>Supersonic keeps its top speed below 230°F</strong>.</p>
<p>Another field that Dyson ventured into is acoustic engineering: The hair dryer is a device that has always been known to generate considerable noise levels. This happens as the motor, along with airflow, produces sound waves of undesirable frequencies that tend to cause irritation in human ears. Dyson’s design of the motor ensures the <strong>generation of sound waves of frequencies higher than 16kHz&nbsp;which cannot be detected by human ears</strong>. Additionally, Dyson provided an acoustic silencer in the airflow path which serves to suppress sound waves. The outcome is a hair dryer that produces less noise than its predecessors.</p>
<p>The Dyson Origin series has only one magnetic attachment which is the styling concentrator. The styling concentrator is used for focusing airflow which enables the user to dry or style his or her hair. The magnetic attachment system is an excellent design aspect of this series: The user can easily switch from one attachment to another without waiting for it to cool down or handling it with hot hands.</p>
<p>For only $299, you will be paying the price of five salon blowouts but you will be gaining so much more than that.</p>

              <p>The modern tech life means juggling multiple devices that all need power at different times, and there’s nothing more frustrating than watching your laptop die while your phone sits at 10% because you only have one charger between them. Baseus just solved that <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4261/">headache with their 100W USB-C charger that’s now down to $34 on Amazon, dropped from its usual $49 price tag</a>. This <strong>three-port powerhouse</strong> can charge your MacBook Pro, iPad, and iPhone simultaneously and at this all-time low price, it costs less than what Apple charges for a basic 20W charging brick.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4261/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Two USB-C and One USB-A Ports</h2>
<p>The two USB-C ports support the PD 3.0 protocol which is the current standard for fast charging on everything from smartphones to laptops. When you plug a single device into either the C1 or C2 port, <strong>you get the full 100W output, enough to charge a 16-inch MacBook Pro at full speed</strong>. That means you can go from dead to 50% in about 30 minutes, which is clutch when you’re running between meetings or need to top up before a flight. The 100W capability also covers the Steam Deck, iPad Pro and any other USB-C laptop that draws significant power.</p>



<p>The intelligence comes into play when you’re charging multiple devices simultaneously. Baseus has incorporated their own smart power allocation technology, BPS 3.0, in this charging station. The technology analyzes which devices you’re connecting to each port simultaneously <strong>then allocates the power according to the device</strong>. Let’s say you’re charging your MacBook Pro on port C1, your iPhone on port C2 and your wireless headphones on the USB-A port. The charging station automatically adjusts the power allocation among all three. Your laptop receives more priority and more current, your phone gets charged as quickly as it can, which is its safe charging speed, and your headphones get exactly what they need, which doesn’t mean it gets excess current.</p>



<p>Heat management is where cheaper chargers fall apart, sometimes literally. When you’re pushing 100W through a device the size of a deck of cards, thermal control becomes critical. Baseus uses gallium nitride technology which is a newer semiconductor material that’s significantly more efficient than traditional silicon. GaN components <strong>generate less heat and allow for smaller charger designs</strong> without sacrificing power output. But Baseus didn’t stop there: They incorporated their BCT cooling system (which stands for Baseus Cooling Technology) and it actively monitors the internal temperature in real-time. Better thermal management also extends the lifespan of both the charger and your device batteries, since excessive heat degrades lithium-ion cells over time.</p>
<p>The physical design is engineered well: <strong>The prongs can be folded flat into the device</strong>. As a result, you don’t have to worry about the metal pins damaging your other electronics in a backpack or luggage. Being slightly more than two inches on each side, it doesn’t occupy much space on a power strip. Moreover, it won’t occupy space in other outlets. Otherwise, you would be forced to use a laptop charger that’s the size of a small box.</p>
<p>For only $34, you will be charged less than a single dollar per three watts of its charging abilities, supporting all the gadgets you use.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/hp-laptop-with-office-365-drops-65-now-beats-even-the-cheapest-budget-laptop-on-price-2000639086</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Looking for a solid laptop that won’t drain your bank account? HP just dropped one of the most aggressive deals we’ve seen this year on Amazon: The <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5001/">HP 14-inch laptop with a full year of Office 365 included is now sitting at $279, slashed from its typical $799 price tag</a>. You read that right, a 65% discount that makes this machine cheaper than most bare-bones budget laptops on the market. This configuration <strong>packs an Intel Processor N150, 4GB RAM, 256GB total storage</strong> and a full docking station with 8 ports. HP couldn’t offer such a steep reduction on their official site, so they’re quietly moving inventory through Amazon where the real laptop deals happen.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5001/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Why This Deal Actually Makes Sense For Regular People</h2>
<p>Most people don’t need a powerhouse machine that costs over a grand. You need something that boots up fast, handles your daily tasks without freezing, and doesn’t die halfway through your workday. This HP 14 checks all those boxes with surprising competence. Under the hood, y<strong>ou’ve got an Intel Processor N150 that can turbo up to 3.6 GHz</strong> when you need that extra push. That’s a <strong>quad-core chip with four threads and 6 MB of cache</strong> which translates to smooth performance when you’re juggling browser tabs, editing documents or video calling with your team. It’s not built for gaming or heavy video editing, but for work and light content creation, it handles everything without the annoying lag.</p>



<p>What’s more, you’re getting 4GB of DDR4 RAM which is honestly the bare minimum for comfortable multitasking in Windows 11, but it’s enough for most everyday scenarios like working in Office apps, streaming content, and managing emails. The storage solution is interesting because <strong>HP splits it between 128GB of internal flash storage and includes a 128GB Micro SD card</strong> in the package. This gives you 256GB total to work with, and you can keep your operating system and programs on the internal drive while using the SD card for documents.</p>
<p>The battery life is another strong point here: <strong>HP claims it lasts through a full day of work or study,</strong> and based on the specs and the efficiency of the N150 processor, that’s believable. No more hunting for outlets in coffee shops or lecture halls.</p>



<p>The connectivity is surprisingly good given it’s a laptop of this price: You get the benefits of Wi-Fi 6, which is the latest standard for quick and stable wireless networking. The port selection is genuinely impressive. There’s a USB Type-C port capable of 10Gbps transfer speeds, two USB Type-A ports for your legacy devices, HDMI 1.4b for connecting to external displays, and an SD card reader.</p>
<p>But here’s where it gets better: <strong>HP bundles an 8-in-1 docking station</strong> that expands your connectivity even further. You also get an additional USB Type-C port, an RJ-45 ethernet port for wired connections, two more USB 3.0 ports, both SD and Micro SD card slots, a headphone jack, and a 4K HDMI port. That <strong>docking station alone would cost you $30 to $50 separately</strong>, and it transforms this laptop into a legitimate workstation when you’re at your desk.</p>
<p>The laptop comes <strong>pre-loaded with Windows 11 Home S mode</strong>. Windows S mode is a stripped-down version of Windows that will not install anything from outside the Microsoft store. The good news is you can switch out of S mode for free if you need to install traditional desktop programs.</p>
<p>The best part of the <strong>whole deal is the addition of Office 365, an entire year of it</strong>. This costs a staggering amount of $69.99 annually: It provides users with Microsoft Word, Excel, PowerPoint, Outlook as well as 1TB of cloud storage via OneDrive. For a student or a professional using office tools, this itself provides an amazing amount of worth to an immense portion of the purchase price.</p>
