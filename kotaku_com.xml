              <p>Minimalist nightstand fans are going to love this limited-time Amazon deal. The<strong> Anker MagSafe Compatible MagGo Charger Stand</strong> takes your alarm clock and the charging cables for your iPhone and AirPods and combines them into one small, sleek, powerful fast charger, and <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3960/">it’s a steal at just $34</a>.</p>
<p>So many of these megadeals are marked down so dramatically because they’re somehow outdated or incompatible with the latest tech release, but this Anker&nbsp; MagGo 15W charger is Qi2 certified and able to fast-charge the latest Apple devices, including the iPhone 16 series, AirPods 4, and AirPods Pro 2. Chances are it’ll remain current when Apple’s next line of smartphones and AirPods drop too, because Apple looks to be locked into MagSafe and Qi2 charging for its devices.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3960/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Ditch That Clock</h2>
<p>The iPhone is a brilliant alarm clock, but when it’s lying flat on your nightstand and hardwired to a charging block, it can lead to fumbling to find the phone as you come out of a dead sleep, and also hard to see the time. When you attach your iPhone to the Anker MagGo charging stand, you can turn it into horizontal position and place it in StandBy mode, giving you the clock display and customizable widgets and photos.</p>
<p>That’s a huge upgrade from the old digital clock, and you can also tilt the iPhone up to 45 degrees backward so you have the ideal viewing angle. Since it’s a MagSafe charger, there’s no wire to get in the way or come loose as you move the phone to exactly where you want it.</p>



<h2>Supercharger</h2>
<p>While it’s taking over for your alarm clock, the Anker MagGo is also bringing fast charging to your iPhone and your AirPods, so they’re both fully loaded when you wake up. The two built-in LED lights let you see that each device is charging, and charging quickly: An iPhone 15 Pro will go from dead to 25% charged in just 21 minutes on the Anker MagGo, nearly half the time a 7.5W charger takes.</p>
<p>The Anker MagGo dual charger comes in white or black to fit your decor, and it’s also a perfect fit for a desktop or work station. It comes with a 5-foot USB-C cable and Anker’s two-year warranty.<a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3960/"> Best of all, it’s 37% off right now at Amazon, just a little over $34 for this reliable and elegant-looking charging and spatial arrangement solution</a>. It’s a limited-time deal, though, so don’t hesitate and end up stuck with that old alarm clock.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Another dang Monday!? Didn’t we do this already? Fine, whatever, let’s go again. Welcome to Morning Checkpoint, <em>Kotaku’s</em> daily round-up of news and other stuff you might care about. Today, we have news about the next <em>Wolfenstein</em> game, information on how Nintendo develops new ideas, a trailer for the next <em>Knives Out</em> film, and bad news for people planning to play <em>Octopath Traveler 0</em> on Switch.</p> <h2><strong>Your city’s size in <em>Octopath Traveler 0</em> depends on what platform you play on</strong></h2> <p>In December, Square Enix’s<em> Octopath Traveler 0</em> will launch and, in addition to questing through dungeons and slaying monsters, players will be building a new town in this upcoming RPG. But how big your in-game town can be will not be dependent on your skill or determination. As recently revealed by Square Enix and <a href="https://x.com/Wario64/status/1963999156030296316">spotted by Wario64</a>, the maximum size of your city will depend on what platform you play <em>Octopath Traveler 0</em> on, with weaker consoles being more limited than PC and newer machines.</p> <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">Octopath Traveler 0 platform specs <a href="https://t.co/2jhpK7osy6">pic.twitter.com/2jhpK7osy6</a></p> <p>— Wario64 (@Wario64) <a href="https://twitter.com/Wario64/status/1963999156030296316?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">September 5, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <p>The OG Switch has a 250 building limit. Meanwhile, the Switch 2 and PS4 max out at 400 buildings. Finally, if you want 500 buildings (and who doesn’t?), you’ll need to play the RPG on Xbox Series X/S, PS5, or PC.&nbsp; As you might expect, where you play decides your max FPS and resolution, too, which are also included in the chart above. Lots to think about for <em>Octopath</em> fans ahead of the game’s December 4 release date.</p>

 <h2><strong>MachineGames hopes to make a third <em>Wolfenstein</em> game</strong></h2> <p>While <em>Indiana Jones and the Great Circle</em> was a fantastic video game and one of the best Indy adventures yet, it wasn’t what I wanted from developer MachineGames. What I wanted was a new <em>Wolfenstein</em> game. It felt like there was at least one more story to be told with the studio’s version of BJ, and it turns out that’s in fact the case.</p> <p><a href="https://youtu.be/E189QG28rnE?t=2440">In <em>NoClip’s</em> newly released documentary</a> about the history of MachineGames and the making of its <em>Wolfenstein</em> series, co-founder and studio head Jerk Gustafsson confirmed that the plan from day one was always to make a trilogy. And that’s still the plan, assuming the studio gets a chance to make one more <em>Wolfenstein</em> game.</p>

 <p>“I think this is important to say, because we have always seen this as a trilogy. So that journey for BJ – even during those first weeks at id, when we mapped out <em>New Order</em> – we still had a plan for at least that character. What will happen in the second one. What will happen in the third one. I think that’s important to say because, at least I hope, that we’re not done with <em>Wolfenstein</em> yet. We have a story to tell.”</p> <h2><strong>Nintendo doesn’t need new franchises</strong></h2> <p>Former Nintendo developer and programmer Ken Watanabe <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2025-09-05/nintendo-invents-new-ways-to-have-fun-with-old-characters">told <em>Bloomberg</em></a> that the company doesn’t really have a need to create new franchises, as it can simply incorporate new mechanics and ideas into one of its existing and already established IP.</p> <p data-cy="paragraph">“New franchises haven’t come out simply because there’s no real need to make them,” Watanabe told the outlet. “When Nintendo wants to do something new, it’s basically about the gameplay mechanics first — about creating a new way to play. As for the skin or the wrapper, they don’t really fuss over it. They just pick whatever fits that new gameplay best.”</p> <h2><em>Schedule 1</em> will add shrooms, which apparently weren’t in the game before</h2> <p><em>Schedule 1,</em> the super-popular drug-dealing simulator on Steam, recently asked players what they wanted added to the game next, and <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3164500/Schedule_I/">the fanbase voted for shrooms</a>. Which is fine, but also weird to me. It’s not weird that people playing a game about drugs want more drug variety, but, weirdly, shrooms weren’t in <em>Schedule 1</em> to begin with. Anyway, shrooms will be added around November as a free update. Meanwhile, fishing fans, you lost out, and that feature won’t be added to the game in the near future. Sorry.</p>  <h2>ICMYI:</h2> <ul> <li><a href="https://kotaku.com/new-tron-3-ad-features-mr-beast-tron-ares-disney-2000623530">New <em>Tron: Ares</em> ad features Mr. Beast</a></li> <li><a href="https://kotaku.com/no-mans-sky-the-office-base-building-settlement-nbc-2000623462">Someone recreated The Office in <em>No Man’s Sky</em></a></li> <li><a href="https://kotaku.com/game-pass-pete-hines-bethesda-starfield-indiana-jones-2000623467">Ex-Bethesda has some thoughts about Game Pass</a></li> </ul> <h2>Watch This:</h2>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/one-of-amazons-best-selling-portable-monitors-just-broke-its-record-low-again-now-almost-free-2000623543</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/one-of-amazon%E2%80%99s-best-selling-portable-monitors-just-broke-its-record-low-again-now-almost-free.1291611/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>It’s almost a given that as tech devices advance and evolve, they shrink in size. If you’re of a certain age that you once owned one of those massive cathode ray tube monitors, the idea of an affordable portable monitor with a great picture would have been laughable not that long ago. Now, however, ultra-thin FHD screens that fit easily in a backpack or carry-on bag are commonplace, and one of the top-selling models just keeps tumbling in price at Amazon.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3959/">The MNN 15.6-inch FHD portable monitor, which sells over 10,000 units per month at Amazon, is now just $60</a> — a 33% drop from its usual $90, and a spectacular deal for commuters, remote workers, parents, or anyone looking to escape the single-screen setup once and for all.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3959/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Mega-Compatibility</h2>
<p>What makes this $60 portable monitor such a steal isn’t its portability as much as the fact that it’s nearly universally compatible with any device you can think of. The MNN Portable Monitor has USB-C and HDMI ports, and works with PC and Mac laptops and desktops, smartphones and tablets, Xbox and PlayStation gaming consoles, Raspberry Pi, and even the Nintendo Switch and Steam Deck handheld consoles.</p>
<p>Devices with a full-function USB-C port and Thunderbolt 3 or 3.1 compatibility can connect directly to the MNN monitor with a single cable, and ones lacking a full-function USB-XC port can also connect with a USB-A cable and HDMI cable. Best of all, the MNN Portable Monitor is powered by the device you attach it to, provided it’s a full-function USB-C port. Otherwise it can connect via an external DC 5V, 3A/9V, 2A, or PD 5-20V power adapter.</p>



<h2>Quality To Go</h2>
<p>All that compatibility wouldn’t be worth a lot of the picture was lousy, but this is a brilliant 15.6-inch HDR screen with a 1000:1 contrast ratio, low blue light, 16.7 million colors, and it works in both portrait and landscape modes. The 5ms response time makes it a viable screen for gaming consoles, which makes gaming on the go a reality.</p>
<p>The portability factor is obvious — the MNN portable monitor is barely a third of an inch thick, protected by a durable faux-leather cover that also doubles as a stand, and weighs a shockingly light 1.52 pounds. It’s designed for an easy fit in a backpack, briefcase, or any go-bag you take on the road. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3959/">The limited-time price of just $60 at Amazon is the lowest yet for the MNN 15.6-inch Portable FHD Monitor, and it’s safe to say it’s worth every penny.</a></p>

            <title><![CDATA[New Atari Handheld Looks Great But Costs Almost As Much As A Switch Lite]]></title>
            <link>https://kotaku.com/atari-handheld-gamestation-go-preorder-game-list-2000624033</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/new-atari-handheld-looks-great-but-costs-almost-as-much-as-a-switch-lite.1291608/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Do we need an Atari gaming handheld in 2025? Definitely not. Do I still really want the Atari Gamestation Go? Absolutely. The retro portable strikes a great balance between ostentatious and sleek, retro and modern. But while the latest Atari machine is full of games from the ’80s, it packs a contemporary price tag of $180.</p> <p>Produced by the folks at My Arcade, the Atari Gamestation Go was first revealed at CES 2025 near the start of the year. It packs a 7-inch high resolution full-color display, a rechargeable battery for 4-5 hours of playtime, and over 200 classics from Atari’s past. Pre-orders went live today at Best Buy and GameStop, with the device shipping sometime in October. Here’s a sample of the game list:</p> <ul> <li><i>Asteroids: Recharged</i></li> <li><i>Missile Command: Recharged</i></li> <li><i>Centipede: Recharged</i></li> <li><i>Breakout: Recharged</i></li> <li><i>Berzerk: Recharged</i></li> <li><i>Balls of Steel Pinball</i></li> <li><i>PAC-MAN</i></li> <li><i>Breakout</i></li> <li><i>Tempest</i></li> <li><i>Warlords</i></li> </ul> <p>The coolest features by far are the integrated paddle, trak-ball and number pad. Not only do they look really cool with the yellow, tan, orange, and black colorway, they’re also functional for deep-cuts like <em>Codebreakers</em> and <em data-processed="true">Missile Command</em>. Assuming the emulation is decent, the buttons feel good, and the device isn’t uncomfortable to hold, it could end up being one of the best ways to play one of gaming’s often overlooked but historically significant back catalogs.</p>

 <p>The fact that the Atari Gamestation Go&nbsp;<em>only</em> plays old Atari games is probably for the best. What better way to put down the smartphone and purge the algorithmic slop-scrolling than by locking into twitchy pattern recognition with OG shoot ’em up <em>Space Invaders</em>? But $180 is nothing to sneeze at. The Switch Lite might officially be $230 but it launched at $200 and can now often be found secondhand for just $100.</p> <p>Retro consoles are cashing in on nostalgia more than anything, but the Atari Gamestation Go is still coming in pretty steep. The NES and SNES Classic came in at $60 and $80 respectively when Nintendo launched them years back. The PlayStation Classic was still only $100. North of that and thoughts of childhood <em>Pitfall</em> sessions brush up again the harsh realities of the current family budget. At least the Atari Gamestation Go doubles as a visual showpiece and a portable time machine.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/silksong-first-boss-bell-beast-guide-2000624015</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/don%E2%80%99t-let-hollow-knight-silksong%E2%80%98s-first-boss-stop-you-from-playing.1291560/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>There are ways in which <a href="https://kotaku.com/hollow-knight-silksong-steam-review-bomb-chinese-translation-2000623496"><em>Hollow Knight: Silksong</em></a> can be a bit more difficult than its predecessor. For players new to the Metroidvania Soulslike series, it can feel a bit like taking a plunge in a cold lake: bracing but unpleasant. The game’s first boss fight is against the Bell Beast. If you’re feeling a bit daunted at first, the good news is that the giant arthropod is easy to defeat once you’ve got the pattern down.</p> <h2>Where do I find <em>Silksong</em>‘s first boss?</h2> <p>The Bell Beast is located early in the game in The Marrow. You can’t get to him until you unlock the Silk Spear ability next door in Mosshome. After getting it, there’s a silk obstacle in The Marrow you can cut through to unlock the way to the Bell Beast’s layer.</p>  <p>Glad you asked? While many <em>Silksong</em> players probably won’t have much trouble with this guy, this is a judgement-free zone with the sole goal of trying to help as many <em>Hollow Knight</em> players break through that first barrier and be able to continue their journey to the Citadel.</p>

 <p>The Bell Beast has two phases and four attacks. In the first phase he’ll just appear from underground and run across the screen or jump over your head. If he’s running across, you can jump over him and hit him 2-3 times from the back before he burrows back under. If he’s about to jump over you, just stand in the middle of the screen underneath the peak of the arc and hit him in the back again.</p> <figure id="attachment_2000624024" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000624024"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000624024">Team Cherry</figcaption></figure> <p>The second phase is where things get slightly trickier. First, he’ll come up from the ground and spawn two bells that roll across opposite sides of the screen. These are easy to enough to jump over and get a few hits in. Later, he’ll start shaking the whole cavern and have bells drop from the ceiling that bounce while he’s rotating through his other three attacks. Sometimes these bells bounce toward you. Sometimes they bounce away.</p>

 <p>If you stand close to where they drop, they’ll miss you completely no matter which direction they’re going. Plus they disappear before the second bounce. But watch out because during this phase he’ll also spawn bells each time he comes out of the ground.</p> <h2>He keeps killing me in three hits!</h2> <p>Brutal, right? Even though he’s <em>Silksong</em>‘s first boss, Bell Beast, like everything else in the game, hits pretty hard. That leaves little time to memorize his attack pattern and not much room for error once you do. The biggest general tip for the boss fight, like lots of encounters in <em>Silksong</em>, is just to stay calm. Don’t move around more than you have to and don’t overreact to flashy attacks.</p> <p>Imagine instead of a giant, harrowing roly-poly bug constantly trying to squash you, he’s just a rectangle-shaped hit box moving around the screen in very predictable ways. Save at a bench nearby, hit enough enemies to have a full roll of silk to bind with/heal yourself at the start of the fight, and then stick to dodging each of the four attacks as they come. You’ll get to the end of the fight thinking, “How is he still alive?” but then after a few more hits he’ll be liberated and become your new best friend.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/hollow-knight-silksong-steam-review-bomb-chinese-translation-2000623496"><i><span>Hollow Knight: Silksong</span></i></a><span> is a tough game. Its bosses hit hard, your early arsenal of abilities can feel quite limiting in combat encounters, and its volatile level design can send you accidentally tumbling down into a chasm and losing an hour of progress. But while these kinds of challenges were arguably all to be expected from a sequel to the challenging original, there’s one brand of platforming segment whose sheer difficulty is catching players off guard, especially if they miss an optional upgrade early on in the game.</span></p> <p><span>Hornet, the needle-wielding hero of </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/hollow-knight-silksong-how-long-completionist-achievement-2000623157"><i><span>Silksong</span></i></a><span>, starts off the game with a downward diagonal aerial strike that is used as both an anti-air attack as well as a platforming tool in sections where she must basically bounce on pods to get some verticality and reach higher areas of the map, using her needle as a pogo stick. By default, this attack has a diagonal slant that makes it difficult to precisely strike these pods and position yourself in an optimal way to reach the next one. Though there’s an available, optional upgrade that can make traversing this section much easier, many players miss it,, and because getting through these sections without it is hard but not impossible to pull off, a lot of fans think these are simply mandatory skill checks for your timing and positioning, and are uploading clips of themselves trying, failing, and crashing out.</span></p>       <p><span>The thing is, these sections don’t have to be </span><i><span>as </span></i><span>hard as some folks have been making them out to be, but </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/silksong-demo-hands-on-price-hollow-knight-pax-west-2000621695"><i><span>Silksong</span></i><span>’s non-linear nature</span></a><span> means not everyone is finding the upgrade that makes them significantly easier. Crests are equippable items you’ll find throughout </span><i><span>Silksong </span></i><span>that allow you to swap between different builds, and the Crest of the Wanderer swaps out Hornet’s diagonal air attack for a standard downward strike similar to the one the Knight can perform in the original </span><i><span>Hollow Knight</span></i><span>, allowing you to more easily and precisely pogo your way through these sections. Getting them isn’t an easy task, however, as you’ll have to unlock a few areas, abilities, and items to do so. Here’s </span><i><span>IGN</span></i><span>’s</span> <span>rundown of how to find the Crest of the Wanderer:</span></p>  <p><span>Keep in mind that this will also cut down the range on Hornet’s attacks, so you’ll have to get in closer in combat. Switching out crests is all about give and take, so it’s up to you to decide which perks and drawbacks are worth it to you. But if you, like many others, are tired of falling into lava and spike pits while you’re trying to pogo on these pods, now you know there is a better way.</span></p>
