Gonzalez was previously at the Barcelona-based NetEase startup Fantastic Pixel Castle working on an MMO codenamed <em>Ghost</em>. “Truly a privilege to work with this incredibly kind and talented team. But a new opportunity arose that I straight-up couldn’t resist,” reads a description of his time at the studio. </p><p>Gonzalez’s contributions to <em>Fallout: New Vegas</em>, whose open-world RPG storytelling and quest design remain a series high-water mark for many fans, make his return to the Xbox studio notable. He spent most of the last decade at PlayStation first-party studio Guerrilla Games <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/horizon-zero-dawns-lead-writer-says-they-spent-hundreds-1793772842?_gl=1*1yz94xc*_ga*MzQzNjkwNDM2LjE2NDY2NjQ1NzQ.*_ga_V4QNJTT5L0*MTczODM1Njc2NC4zNjMuMC4xNzM4MzU2NzY3LjU3LjAuMA..&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/horizon-zero-dawns-lead-writer-says-they-spent-hundreds-1793772842?_gl=1*1yz94xc*_ga*MzQzNjkwNDM2LjE2NDY2NjQ1NzQ.*_ga_V4QNJTT5L0*MTczODM1Njc2NC4zNjMuMC4xNzM4MzU2NzY3LjU3LjAuMA..">where he spent hundreds of hours crafting the <em>Horizon Zero Dawn</em> universe</a></span>, which similarly left a lasting impression on players with its sci-fi mysteries and <em>Twilight Zone</em>-like twists. </p><p>Obsidian has been one of Microsoft’s most prolific studios since it was acquired back in 2018.<em> The Outer Worlds </em>launched the following year, an RPG shooter which exchanged <em>Fallout</em>’s grim wasteland for a satirical sci-fi setting in far-off corporate space colonies. It’s since been followed by survival sim <em>Grounded </em>and the Renaissance detective RPG <em>Pentiment</em>, with <em>Avowed</em> arriving next month and <em>The Outer Worlds 2</em> expected by the end of the year. The studio has also been helping the <em>State of Decay 3</em> team with its open world tech. That’s a lot!</p><p>While Gonzalez was quick to silence fan speculation that he might be working on a long-requested <em>Fallout: New Vegas </em>sequel, which wouldn’t have been completely shocking considering what transpired in the first season of the <em>Fallout </em>TV show, it’ll be interesting to see what he does end up working on at Obsidian. Will it be the team’s next big RPG franchise, or a completely different genre mash-up that explores new territory for the studio? I’ll be happy with whatever it might be, as long as it arrives sometime this decade. </p><p>.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

In doing so, the company essentially gave up one of its biggest console-exclusive franchises to Sony and its PlayStation. This is really strange considering that at one point in time, Sony was Xbox’s bitter competitor. </p><h2 id="h101223"><a id=""></a>Xbox dips out of the console war</h2><p>Internally, before its 2001 launch, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://venturebeat.com/games/making-of-the-xbox-1/2/#:~:text=Bachus%20was%20an,of%20the%20Japanese.&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://venturebeat.com/games/making-of-the-xbox-1/2/#:~:text=Bachus%20was%20an,of%20the%20Japanese." target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">the original Xbox was referred to as Project Midway</a></span>. This was a crass reference to WW2's Battle of Midway. During that battle, American forces decisively defeated Japan’s navy. The name clearly indicated that Microsoft wanted to enter into a video game console war with Nintendo and Sony, and it wanted to win. And for years, Xbox, Sony, and Nintendo battled each other. </p><p>One would lower its price, another would launch a new bundle. One would give away free games to subscribers, another would follow suit. Motion controls were copied. Exclusives were secured. It was a very expensive war that had millions of kids around the world bickering on playgrounds over which was better, as teens and adults did the same on internet forums. </p><p>But now, in 2025, Microsoft was willing to give away one of its crown jewels—<em>Forza</em>—to Sony and PlayStation. It’s part of a trend of Xbox making more of its games multiplatform following its purchase of Activision. And rumors are swirling that even more Xbox games and franchises will make the leap to PlayStation and Switch. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.gamingbible.com/news/platform/xbox/halo-master-chief-collection-teased-ps5-port-439080-20250131&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.gamingbible.com/news/platform/xbox/halo-master-chief-collection-teased-ps5-port-439080-20250131" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>The Master Chief Collection</em> is likely to arrive on other platforms</a></span> sooner than later, according to insiders, as is a rumored (but unconfirmed) <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://gameranx.com/updates/id/526870/article/gears-of-war-trilogy-collection-will-be-multiplatform-says-insider/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://gameranx.com/updates/id/526870/article/gears-of-war-trilogy-collection-will-be-multiplatform-says-insider/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>Gears of War</em> trilogy collection</a></span>. Insiders are also claiming that <em>Fable</em> and <em>Starfield</em> will be making the leap to PlayStation 5 and Switch 2.</p><p>Combine that shift in Xbox’s strategy with Game Pass being available on more devices and the company downplaying console sales for years and years now, and it becomes clear that Microsoft isn’t fighting in the console wars anymore. It arguably hasn’t been for a few years now, but the news of <em>Forza </em>jumping ship should be the confirmation that its flown the white flag and decided to become a massive publisher, harnessing the combined power of Game Pass, all of its studios, and Activision/Blizzard. It’s a strategy that is already paying off, too. </p><p>So if Xbox is done fighting, who is left? Well, not Nintendo. </p><h2 id="h101224"><a id=""></a>Nintendo isn’t fighting in the war anymore</h2><p>Yes, the company is releasing a Switch 2 and it’s going to sell incredibly well, assuming tariffs don’t inflate the price too much. But in 2025, Nintendo doesn’t care about the console war. </p><p>The Wii U was the last time the company behind Mario arguably tried to compete directly with Sony and Microsoft. It released the Wii U in late 2013, just within a year of the Xbox One and PS4, while trying to court third-party AAA franchises like <em>Mass Effect,</em>&nbsp;<em>Call of Duty, </em>and the <em>Batman: Arkham </em>games.</p><p>The Wii U ultimately was a failure for Nintendo and in 2017, it released the Switch, nearly three years before Sony and Xbox’s next consoles, the Xbox Series X/S and PS5, would arrive. Nintendo realized that it could do its own thing. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/nintendo-completely-bailed-on-console-generations-and-1845719633&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/nintendo-completely-bailed-on-console-generations-and-1845719633">It didn’t need to stick to the hardware cycle of the old console wars</a></span>, competing directly with other companies every five to seven years. Instead, Nintendo focused on giving fans what they always wanted—a hybrid device merging its portable and home consoles into one—and found incredible success.</p><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/switch-2-reveal-trailer-date-nintendo-mario-kart-9-1851739487?_gl=1*1kfnkw9*_ga*NzE0NzM5NTc5LjE3Mjk4Njg5MzU.*_ga_V4QNJTT5L0*MTczNzA0MTE0Mi4xNDEuMS4xNzM3MDQ3NTczLjYwLjAuMA..&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/switch-2-reveal-trailer-date-nintendo-mario-kart-9-1851739487?_gl=1*1kfnkw9*_ga*NzE0NzM5NTc5LjE3Mjk4Njg5MzU.*_ga_V4QNJTT5L0*MTczNzA0MTE0Mi4xNDEuMS4xNzM3MDQ3NTczLjYwLjAuMA..">The Switch 2, launching later this year</a></span>, continues to show that Nintendo doesn’t care about the console war. It’s not concerned about when the PS6 or next Xbox arrive. That doesn’t matter. All it has to do is make a new console that people want every several years and make sure it keeps turning out stellar first-party games for the machine. It can focus on itself and not worry about matching GPUs or terraflops with Sony or Xbox in some never-ending console war. And as long as it sells well, third-party publishers and devs will show up with games, even it means cutting them up and squishing them just to make stuff like Harry Potter or <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/batman-arkham-trilogy-switch-port-framerate-1851074882&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/batman-arkham-trilogy-switch-port-framerate-1851074882">Batman work on the Switch’s hardware</a></span>.</p><p>So if Nintendo is out and Xbox isn’t fighting anymore, then that just leaves Sony. And yeah, I think you can argue that Sony and PlayStation are still fighting the war. But if everyone else has left or given up, is it even a war anymore? </p><h2 id="h101225"><a id=""></a>Sony is the last soldier fighting</h2><p>Sony is still spending a lot of money to secure exclusive games like <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/final-fantasy-7-remake-trilogy-playstation-exclusive-1851313313&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/final-fantasy-7-remake-trilogy-playstation-exclusive-1851313313"><em>Final</em> <em>Fantasy 7 Rebirth</em></a></span><em> </em>and <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/death-stranding-2-on-the-beach-release-date-cast-1851235004#:~:text=Death%20Stranding%202%20will%20launch,PS5%20version%20launches%20in%202025.&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/death-stranding-2-on-the-beach-release-date-cast-1851235004#:~:text=Death%20Stranding%202%20will%20launch,PS5%20version%20launches%20in%202025."><em>Death Stranding 2</em></a></span><em>. </em>And, unlike Xbox, it’s not publishing its big, first-party games day one on PC or including them in its subscription service, PS Plus, at launch.
