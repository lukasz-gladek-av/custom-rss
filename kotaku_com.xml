The final phase of <em>Hades II</em> development involves adding the story’s true ending and other finishing touches. Some additional details are in the in-game Development Roadmap.”</p><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Luy1bWjMOeA&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Luy1bWjMOeA" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">A dramatic reading</a></span> of the new patch notes runs over 38 minutes and includes things like revamping The Flames of Ygnium for snappier combat, new final forms for Nocturnal Arms, and enemies spawning in faster during waves to limit downtime. Probably most noticeable at the outset is that Narcissus has an actual 3D model, animations, and an updated portrait now. No more being self-obsessed with placeholder art. The game’s main menu has also been updated to state that the next update will coincide with the 1.0 launch on PC, Switch 1, and Switch 2 (PlayStation 4, PS5, Xbox One, and Xbox Series X/S will come later). </p><p>While <em>Hades 2 </em>is confirmed to be coming out in full sometime in 2025, Supergiant Games isn’t ready to reveal the exact timing just yet, and I wouldn’t necessarily be surprised if it slips to 2026. “We really appreciate your patience on this,” Kasavin wrote. “Sometimes the last stretch of development on a game can make all the difference, so we have always taken this phase seriously and appreciate your continued support.” We also don’t know what the final price will be. <em>Hades 2</em> is currently $30 on Steam ($27 with the current 10 percent discount), but it could go up to $40 once it’s out on consoles.</p><p>The action roguelite is launching simultaneously on both Switch 1 and Switch 2, with improved visual fidelity and framerate on the newer hardware. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/hades-2-switch-2-exclusivity-pc-steam-1-0-date-1851775233&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/hades-2-switch-2-exclusivity-pc-steam-1-0-date-1851775233">Supergiant hasn’t confirmed yet whether that “next-gen” upgrade will cost more</a></span> or be a free upgrade. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/hollow-knight-silksong-announcement-team-cherry-1851743081&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/hollow-knight-silksong-announcement-team-cherry-1851743081"><em>Hollow Knight: Silksong</em></a></span>, another sequel to a critically acclaimed indie action game, is also set to arrive later this year.

Yet, the legendary author who’s published 65 books and has dozens of films inspired by his imagination machine of a mind has found time for one more first: his first animated feature. <em>Lily</em> became King’s first-ever animated short, and its origins trace back all the way to his high school days.</p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="195928" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="How Alan Wake 2 Builds Upon The 'Remedy-Verse'" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="190" data-playlist="195928,197585,197583" data-current="195928"><div><p>How Alan Wake 2 Builds Upon The 'Remedy-Verse'</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195928/195928_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195928/195928_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195928/195928_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195928/195928_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/21446.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>In the pop-up-book-styled animated short, a young student named Robert is stuck between a rock and a nightmare as he has to deal with his cruel teacher, Ms. Sidley, and a large tiger named Lily in the bathroom. After his teacher berates him for choosing to urinate outside to avoid the tiger, her inspection of his claims has a devastating consequence for her. There’s no blood or gore—trademark components of many of our favorite Stephen King visual adaptations. There’s just kid-friendly horror in the Kate Siegel-directed short, which is exactly how King intended for it to be when he wrote the script according to <em>Lily</em>’s animator Pete Scalzitti, who spoke with <em>Kotaku </em>after the short’s screening at this year’s Tribeca Film Festival.</p><p>“Last summer Stephen wrote our screenplay, adapting it himself from one of his earliest stories ever, <em>Here There Be Tygers</em>, which he actually wrote when he was in high school,” Scalzitti explains. “Deep cut fans of his short stories will notice he changed some of the plot, as well as the names of the main characters, using instead the names from another of his darkest short stories, <em>Suffer the Little Children</em>. But the plot is all <em>Tygers</em>.”</p><p><em>Here There Be Tygers</em> was released in 1968 when the prolific author was only 20 years old, and <em>Suffer the Little Children</em> was published four years later in 1972, making <em>Lily</em> a sterling example of the timelessness of King’s work. The hand-drawn animation makes <em>Lily</em> feel like it was pulled from a time capsule unblemished, and also makes it reminiscent of children’s picture books. All of this was intentional, even down to the way Siegel’s voice guides you through the horror.</p><p>“Kate chose to leave in Stephen’s screen directions and use them as narration, which she discussed with Stephen. This made the film feel like King was reading us a bedtime story, which gave me my solution for how to animate this in 21 days—I treated it like I was creating a pop-up book.”</p><p><em>Lily</em> is part of <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.youtube.com/@darkcornersfilms/videos&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.youtube.com/@darkcornersfilms/videos" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>Dark Corners</em></a></span>, a series created by Siegel and Krsy Fox, which features eight animated horror shorts meant to “gently or not so gently introduce children to the world of horror.” While there isn’t any official word on if and when King decides to drop another, don’t put it past the master of horror to dig back into his treasure trove of stories for an animated feast of terror for the eyes.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
