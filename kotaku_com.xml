              <p><span>The crossover characters and tracks are my least favorite thing about </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/sonic-racing-crossworlds-crossover-review-hatsune-miku-2000626583"><i><span>Sonic Racing: Crossworlds</span></i></a><span>, an otherwise excellent kart racer that didn’t need a bunch of licensed partnerships to stand out. That said, it doesn’t surprise me that the modding community has taken that concept and run with it. I do wish someone would add more </span><i><span>Sonic </span></i><span>characters, such as </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/sonic-movies-eggman-robotnik-agent-stone-stobotnik-gay-1851738189"><span>Agent Stone</span></a><span> from the </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/sonic-hedgehog-3-review-shadow-keanu-reeves-jim-carrey-1851726797"><span>live-action</span> <span>movies</span></a><span>, but it seems like modders have other ideas, like Jack Black’s Steve from </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/a-second-minecraft-movie-is-hitting-theaters-in-just-two-years-2000634000"><span>the </span><i><span>Minecraft </span></i><span>movie</span></a><span>. This is basically my worst nightmare.</span></p> <p><span>Steve, as he exists in the </span><i><span>Minecraft </span></i><span>games, is already in </span><i><span>Crossworlds </span></i><span>as DLC, but now you can play as his obnoxious film counterpart. The “Jack Black Steve Collection” mod on </span><a href="https://gamebanana.com/mods/625763"><span>GameBanana</span></a><span> comes courtesy of user BROCHONKY, who has added two skins for Jack Black’s character to </span><i><span>Crossworlds</span></i><span>. One is a photoscanned action figure that looks just like the actor, while the other is a stylized version of the character that uses </span><i><span>Minecraft</span></i><span>‘s signature blocky style. As a bonus, the mod also includes the infamous Chicken Jockey as it appears in the original game.</span></p>

 <p><span>The mod doesn’t just include skins, it also has voice lines and </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/minecraft-movie-lava-chicken-jockey-easter-egg-game-1851786345"><span>music from the movie</span></a><span>. Black’s trademark hammed-up delivery followed him into Overworld, so the movie has several soundbites that became memes, such as when he announces the Chicken Jockey’s arrival and says “flint and steel” while teaching the other characters to craft. All of this seems like the making of a troll character, but I also feel like hearing these voice lines repeatedly during races would rot your own brain, so you reap what you sow.&nbsp;</span></p>  <p><span>Sega is apparently cool with character mods, so Steve will live to Chicken Jockey another day. The company recently </span><a href="https://x.com/RaceCrossWorlds/status/1976175976720867553"><span>banned cheaters who used mods to win races</span></a><span>, but the company’s </span><a href="https://games.sega.com/eula/?lang=en"><span>End User License Agreement</span></a><span> explicitly encourages creative work like adding new characters to their games. If I see Jack Black Steve on the racetrack, I will be running him off a cliff expeditiously. </span></p>

              <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/battlefield-6-review-steam-ps5-campaign-multiplayer-2000633379"><em>Battlefield 6</em></a> is out today and it’s already blowing up on Steam. The multiplayer military shooter is already well on its way to a million concurrents on Steam alone as fans race to witness the franchise’s revival after years of <a href="https://kotaku.com/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-bad-bf6-battlefield-6-hype-trailer-2000618912">stumbles and collective disappointment</a>. The record-breaking influx initially meant long queues but now some players are facing others issues, including a weird bug that tells them they need to buy and download a multiplayer mode they already own to start playing.</p> <p>Currently in the top-five most played games on Steam, <em>Battlefield</em> is the only game in the top four that’s paid. A $70 price tag hasn’t stopped it from overtaking Valve’s<em> Dota 2</em> and <em>Counter-Strike 2</em>, or the perennial chart-topping battle royale<em> PUBG</em>. Players logging on when the game went live around 11:00 a.m. ET on Friday were immediately greeted by absurd queue positions featuring hundreds of thousands of other players trying to get into the always-online game.</p>

 <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">350,000 in the queue for Battlefield 6 already 🤯 <a href="https://t.co/O6tPcS7e7R">pic.twitter.com/O6tPcS7e7R</a></p> <p>— Tyler James (@FreakyMusic_) <a href="https://twitter.com/FreakyMusic_/status/1976666403723006090?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 10, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <p><em>Battlefield</em> lead producer David Sirland <a href="https://twitter.com/tiggr_/status/1974844687484641683?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1974844687484641683%7Ctwgr%5Ebe0e9b592c93c25f20d70e73f251027fe236f8e8%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamesradar.com%2Fgames%2Fbattlefield%2Fbattlefield-6-lead-tempts-fate-says-servers-should-be-ready-for-launch-after-numerous-betas-across-pc-and-consoles%2F">previously</a> seemed confident that the sequel would be prepared to welcome in the flood of day-one players following months of beta hype and promising feedback. DICE was quick to point out that login queues are part of trying to keep the ramp-up process “smooth and stable for everyone.” That didn’t stop fans from jabbing each other with screenshots of their positions on social media and the Battlefield subreddit. Long before anyone has a KDA to brag about in <em>Battlefield 6</em>, fans are turning to queue positions as high-score markers of elite status. Can anyone <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Battlefield6/comments/1o340g7/i_think_people_are_trying_to_play_bf6_idk_maybe/">beat 458,400</a>?</p>

 <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">Bro….<br>how doe i play the game now? <a href="https://t.co/wMwXmmHGWm">pic.twitter.com/wMwXmmHGWm</a></p> <p>— DjKr4m3r Gaming (@djkr4m3r) <a href="https://twitter.com/djkr4m3r/status/1976671821476073568?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 10, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <p>But other players have been facing a strange issue in which, even after getting into the game, they would be asked to install it. “Running into an error with <em>Battlefield 6</em> that states I need to install multiplayer, and it shows me all the files I need to install,” one wrote on X. “Does anyone have any fixes? I’m afraid I’m going to have to queue again.” <a href="https://x.com/NachoCapart/status/1976678451252953251">Someone else</a> even tried deleting the game, reinstalling everything, and queuing again to try and get in. “If it works, please tell me,” another player wrote back.</p>

 <p>So far, EA has said it’s aware of the problem but hasn’t shared advice on how to address it. “We’re aware of an issue preventing players from accessing the game with some receiving an error stating they need to purchase DLC or similar,” it announced around noon on Friday. “Stay tuned for further updates as the team investigates this issue.”</p>

 <figure id="attachment_2000634048" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000634048"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000634048">Valve / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p>In the meantime, <em>Battlefield 6</em> seems well on its way to living up to to the initial blitz of player interest some had been predicting. Data firm Ampere Analysis <a href="https://www.thegamebusiness.com/p/about-that-ea-deal">told <em>The Game Business</em></a> it was forecasting 1.7 million copies pre-ordered on Steam alone. If all of them login within the first 24 hours, the fall blockbuster will be well on its way to being Steam’s most-played game so far this month.</p> <p>To break into the top 10 of all-time highest concurrent player counts, it’ll need to beat <em>Banana</em>‘s 917,000 record. The top spot is still held by <em>PUBG</em> at over 3.2 million players simultaneously. EA will probably be content with having already edged out its own free-to-play giant <em>Apex Legends</em>, though. No wonder Activision seems so worried <a href="https://kotaku.com/black-ops-7-free-battlefield-6-call-of-duty-rivalry-2000633176">about <em>Call of Duty: Black Ops 7</em> this year</a>. It’s the first time in six years it’s had to go head-to-head with a <em>Battlefield</em> that had a single-player campaign, even if this one has <a href="https://kotaku.com/battlefield-6-review-steam-ps5-campaign-multiplayer-2000633379">left many critics overwhelmed</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><i>Borderlands 4</i> arrived last month on September 12–and some people are <i>still</i> waiting for shader compilation! That’s a preview of what you can expect in this edition of “As Told By Steam Reviews,” because, ya’ll, either this game really, truly runs that poorly or the mimetic nature of the internet is working overdrive here.</p> <p>You’ll quickly spot a trend when it comes to perusing <i>BL4</i>’s user reviews on Steam: Folks are generally struggling to enjoy this game&nbsp; not because of the story or the gunplay– the reviews mostly speak favorably of those elements. No, that pale orange “Mixed” review status on the game’s Steam page is the result of countless reviews trashing how this game runs, with particular ire directed toward Unreal Engine 5, and for Gearbox’s talkative CEO who also <a href="https://kotaku.com/borderlands-4-pc-performance-patch-console-crash-pitchford-2000626826">spent some time doubling as tech support</a> after this game’s bumpy release.</p>

 <p>It’s hard to find a negative review that doesn’t just meditate on the misery of eternal shader compilation and signature UE5 stuttering. But those who ain’t too hot on what <i>BL4</i> is selling seem to find the open world a little shallow. On top of that, there are some who seem to just prefer <i>BL2</i>’s writing over the narrative and dialogue here.</p> <p>Positive reviews, however, reflect that <i>Borderlands</i>’ gun-handling has come a long way since the awkwardness it exhibited of the earlier entries. It feels like a more refined shooter experience than ever, and, to some at least, it seems the writing is much better.</p> <p>So let’s get onto <i>Borderlands 4</i>, as told by Steam reviews!</p> <h2>‘Who are you and what have you done to the borderlands writing team?!’</h2> <figure id="attachment_2000634026" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000634026"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000634026">© Screenshot: Valve / SkeleBen / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <h2>‘You straight up can’t play this game if you’re broke.’</h2> <figure id="attachment_2000634029" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000634029"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000634029">© Screenshot: Valve / OnionMuncher / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <figure id="attachment_2000634030" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000634030"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000634030">© Screenshot: Valve / Mister Macaroni / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <h2>‘The structure of the balance, postgame and gear has actual thought behind it for once.’</h2> <figure id="attachment_2000634031" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000634031"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000634031">© Screenshot: Valve / LazyData / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <figure id="attachment_2000634032" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000634032"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000634032">© Screenshot: Valve / Tchii / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <h2>‘Borderlands 4 feels like that first sip of an energy drink at 2 AM when you know you’re gaming all night.’</h2> <figure id="attachment_2000634034" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000634034"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000634034">© Screenshot: Valve / Shinigami/ Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <h2>‘Most importantly the writing has taken a step in the right direction.’</h2> <figure id="attachment_2000634036" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000634036"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000634036">© Screenshot: Valve / Xzanos / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <h2>‘Randy needs to get off twitter.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>AI’s all-encompassing usefulness is now well beyond debate. A stellar AI tool is great. An AI tool on sale for 82% off is even better. An AI tool on sale for 82% off that you can also stack with a special checkout code that drops another $10 from the price and gives you a lifetime subscription for just $30? That’s downright unbeatable, and <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4692/">that’s what’s waiting for you right how at StackSocial — a lifetime license to 1min.AI is all yours for $30.</a></p>
<p>1min.AI also spares you from doing the deep dive to find out which of the ever-growing number of AI models is the best one to use, because 1min.AI is not an AI model — it’s a smorgasbord of several AI models all in one interface. So if you’re already signed up for several model subscriptions, now’s your chance to streamline them, reduce your bills, and not miss out on any of the latest AI advances.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4692/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at StackSocial</a></p>

<h2>Newbies Welcome</h2>
<p>Even if you’re just now dipping your toe into the AI pond (which is more like an ocean by now), and the idea of suddenly having several different models at your fingertips is intimidating, there’s no need for concern. 1min.AI is amazingly accessible even for newbies. The intuitive user interface is easy to learn once you start feeding it text and/or images and asking it to generate your desired output.</p>
<p>If you’re working with visuals, you can even backtrack if you don’t like what 1min.AI has done with your creative suggestions. It has a Generative Remove tool to take out unwanted elements, giving you ultimate control over your own creative vision. And that vision can take its form virtually any way you like when you deploy the AI models of 1min.AI: image generation, keyword research, content creation — it’s basically limitless.</p>



<h2>One Payment, All the Power</h2>
<p>The one-time purchase of a lifetime subscription to 1min.AI gives you access to AI models including GPT-4o, GPT-4 Turbo, Claude 3 Opus, Gemini Pro 1.5, Llama 3, MistralAI, Command, and more. In time you’ll find which one suits your needs best, and the odds are different needs will be handled best by different models.</p>
<p>The lifetime subscription to 1min.AI’s Pro plan is all-inclusive, with all future updates covered — no recurring costs or monthly fees buried in the small print. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4692/">It normally sells for $234, but StackSocial’s 82% off deal brings the price down to $40, and when you add the code <strong>SAVE10</strong> at checkout, the price gets knocked down to just $30</a>. It doesn’t require any artificial intelligence to see what a great deal this is.</p>

              <p>How will Radiance Cores make make web-slinging even better in <em>Spider-Man 3</em>? How much of<em> Battlefield 7</em> will be AI-generated once Saudi Arabia takes over? And why is licensed DLC fueling a <em>Sonic</em> kart-racing renaissance? Welcome to another edition of Morning Checkpoint, <em>Kotaku</em>‘s daily roundup of gaming news and culture. The Eagles spiked another one last night. Now begins the annual Philly football crashout before things start to recover after Thanksgiving.</p>   <p>The architect behind Sony’s upcoming gaming hardware sat down with AMD’s senior VP of computing, Jack Huynh, to discuss how the two companies’ joint partnership in advancing GPU tech will make Joel’s beard in <em>The Last of Us Part I</em> look even more awe-inducing on next-gen hardware. They talked about Neural Arrays, Radiance Cores, and Universal Compression. No, these aren’t <a href="https://x.com/JackMHuynh/status/1976272374543630842?s=19"><em>Destiny 2</em> patch notes</a>, they’re a roadmap to what will seemingly make gaming on PS6 marginally better than current-gen tech.</p>

 <p>In layman’s terms, it’s all supposed to mean more efficiency that lets developers draw better performance and visual fidelity out of the existing GPU. It will seemingly scale with AI tech to give you more bang for your buck across the spectrum, whether you’re playing on a high-end living room console or the <a href="https://kotaku.com/ps6-leak-specs-sony-handheld-price-release-date-2000614206">rumored PlayStation handheld</a> that’s coming. Cerny didn’t call out the PS6 by name but did suggest it will be here in the next “few years.”</p>

 <p>“Overall, it’s of course still very early days for these technologies, they only exist in simulation right now,” he said. “But the results are quite promising and I’m really excited about bringing them to a future console in a few years’ time.” Microsoft is also working with AMD on its next-gen hardware, which it <a href="https://kotaku.com/xbox-next-gen-console-leak-rumor-costco-sams-club-2000632026">promises it hasn’t canceled</a>.</p>

 <h2>Players are having too much fun with the new <em>Minecraft</em> pack in <em>Sonic Racing: CrossWorlds</em></h2>   <p>The <em>Minecraft</em> pack arrived in-game this week and costs $6 for the addition of Steve, Alex, Creeper, the<em> Minecraft</em> vehicle and World course, and other cosmetics. Sonic fans are already calling it “<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/SonicTheHedgehog/comments/1o1s4wa/the_minecraft_track_is_peak/">peak</a>.” Sonic can <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/SonicTheHedgehog/comments/1o1s1eo/lol_most_sonic_characters_barely_stick_out_the/">barely see out over the top</a> of the <em>Minecraft</em> cart vehicle. In no other game can you have a Creeper race Shadow while riding in a Hatsune Miku box.</p>

 <h2>Galactus tells Ubisoft to “fuck off” over canceled Civil War-era <em>Assassin’s Creed</em> game</h2> <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">Once again, fuck off <a href="https://t.co/kidkOjOZYd">https://t.co/kidkOjOZYd</a></p> <p>— Ralph Ineson (@ralphineson) <a href="https://twitter.com/ralphineson/status/1976428674397491324?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 9, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <p>British actor Ralph Ineson had <a href="https://x.com/ralphineson/status/1976428674397491324">harsh words</a> for the publisher following former<a href="https://www.gamefile.news/p/scoop-ubisoft-cancelled-a-post-civil"><em> Kotaku</em> EIC Stephen Totilo’s report</a> that an <em>Assassin’s Creed</em> game featuring <a href="https://kotaku.com/assassins-creed-game-cancel-reconstruction-black-slave-2000633318">a former slave fighting an emerging Ku Klux Klan</a> during post-Civil War Reconstruction was canceled over fears it was too controversial during America’s current reactionary lurch. The actor played Charles Vane in <em>Assassin’s Creed 4: Black Flag</em> (<a href="https://kotaku.com/assassin-s-creed-4-black-flag-remake-skull-bones-1850596271">which is currently getting an unannounced remake</a>) and more recently Cid in <em>Final Fantasy XVI</em> and Lorath Nahr in<em> Diablo 4</em>. He <a href="https://kotaku.com/fantastic-four-first-steps-galactus-ralph-ineson-suit-1851786828">also played Galactus</a> in this year’s<em> Fantastic Four </em>movie.

 <h2>EA exec calls generative AI “very seducing”</h2> <p>Speaking of everyone’s favorite $1 trillion Ponzi scheme, EA’s general manager of DICE and Criterion Games, Rebecka Coutaz, <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c8xrkxdkkrno">told the <em>BBC</em></a> (via <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ea-exec-insists-players-wont-see-anything-made-by-very-seducing-generative-ai-in-battlefield-6"><em>IGN</em></a>) that there is no generative AI in the finished version of <em>Battlefield 6</em>, though the technology is used early in the development process “to allow more time and more space to be creative.” CEO Andrew Wilson previously told investors that AI was going to be at the heart of everything the company does moving forward, and <a href="https://kotaku.com/ea-saudi-bioware-ai-lgbtq-debt-junk-bond-2000630647">some developers within the company</a> have told&nbsp;<em>Kotaku</em> there’s new pressure from above to experiment with AI tools wherever possible.</p>

 <p><em>The Financial Times</em> reported that EA’s new Saudi and private equity owners are banking on an AI transformation to help it pay off $20 billion in debt. &nbsp;“If we can break the magic with AI it will help us be more innovative and more creative,” Coutaz told the<em> BBC</em>.</p> <h2><em>Fortnite</em>‘s new Ghostface mythic weapon is wrecking people</h2>   <p><a href="https://bsky.app/profile/blueskynoise.com/post/3m2rxomnvss2u">The Last Call Knife</a> changes your costume to the <em>Scream</em> icon and offers voice lines and a speed bonus. Most importantly, it lets you use a phone to ping nearby enemies so you can get the jump on them. Players can also pick up Leatherface’s weapon from<em> Texas Chainsaw Massacre</em> but it’s apparently not as good. “Just so everyone knows, Ghostface beats chainsaw. Found out the hard way,” one fan <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/FortNiteBR/comments/1o2ffu7/new_ghostface_mythic_is_awesome_at_making_people/">wrote</a> on Reddit.</p> <h2>Physical Switch editions of the PS1-era <em>Final Fantasy</em> games are finally coming West</h2> <p>They won’t be cheap, though. The<em> Final Fantasy VII</em> and <em>VIII</em> double-pack <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/wario64.bsky.social/post/3m2rjvdvexa2r">is $40</a> on Nintendo’s last-gen console, while <em>Final Fantasy IX</em> is $40 all by itself. At least there’s not a game key card in sight though for these HD remasters. Square Enix must know their fans are marks. I suspect they (we) know it too, though I personally prefer the PS4 version of <em>Final Fantasy VIII</em> <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/FinalFantasy/comments/k6m2g9/everyone_is_hating_on_the_cover_of_ffviii/">with this neat box art</a>.</p> <h2>ICYMI:</h2> <ul> <li><a href="https://kotaku.com/arc-raiders-extraction-pvpve-progression-wipe-loot-2000633739">Arc Raiders is an extraction shooter trying to solve the worst thing about extraction shooters</a></li> <li><a href="https://kotaku.com/the-discord-hack-sounds-really-really-bad-2000633690">The Discord hack offers an important warning</a></li> <li><a href="https://kotaku.com/battlefield-6-review-steam-ps5-campaign-multiplayer-2000633379">Is <em>Battlefield</em> back?
