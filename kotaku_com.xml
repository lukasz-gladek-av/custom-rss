              <p>Last week, I finally traveled to New York City to visit the <em>Kotaku</em> office, hang out with the people who work there, and even meet up with some former staff. It was a great time! Had a blast visiting the city, and getting there was a breeze. However, getting home was a mess and involved me crashing in the Detroit Metro Airport for seven hours before heading home to Kansas City. But it wasn’t all bad news. While in the airport, I found a strange vending machine that dispenses hot personal pizza pies.</p> <p><a href="https://bsky.app/profile/zackzwiezen.com/post/3mafio2oits2b">My wife and I landed in Detroit around midnight.</a> After verifying our new tickets to Kansas City with the staff, we picked out a spot near our terminal and killed time until our flight. Once we had set up a home base in the corner of the seating area, not far from a bathroom, charging station, and water fountain, I decided to explore. I quickly stumbled upon a 24/7 area of the airport<!--StartFragment --><span>—mostly deserted at 1 a.m.<!--StartFragment -->—<!--EndFragment --></span>that was filled with different vending machines. It was the Pizza Cat machine that caught my eye.</p>

 <p>I was hungry. And I didn’t want to eat more chips and jerky. I wanted something hot and tasty. So a big vending machine promising hot pizzas in five minutes made me excited. I wasn’t alone either. Before I could get to the machine, an older man with a large roller suitcase walked up to the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/shorts/7Hdkrxnw9Ms">Pizza Cat</a> and began ordering a pizza. He then stepped back and watched. I did too. The machine hides what it does, but I was able to hear what sounded like a small motor and fan kick on.</p>

 <p>About five minutes later, a cardboard box containing the man’s cheese pizza popped out of a slot. He turned around, looked at me, and then sort of shrugged as if to say, “Huh, this is weird.” I replied, “Weird, but hey, it’s pizza!” I must have startled him because he let go of his luggage, which fell to the floor with a loud thud, and in the process nearly dropped his newly acquired pizza. After I helped him get situated, he scurried off to eat his food.</p>

 <figure id="attachment_2000655810" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000655810"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000655810">©Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p>Meanwhile, I repeated the process he’d just finished and used the large touchscreen to order a pepperoni pizza. Five minutes later, it popped out in a box. As I was grabbing it, another person, a younger man, slipped in behind me to toss away his pizza box. “Pretty good, actually!” he shared with me before leaving. I wasn’t so sure.</p>

 <p>Sitting back down with my wife in the corner of the airport we’d picked out, I opened the box and found a small, very thin, and slightly greasy little pizza. It had a crispy crust and looked okay. But when I picked up a slice, it felt very soft and rubbery. Thankfully, it wasn’t chewy, but the bland dough and tiny amount of sauce were disappointing. The cheese was fine and the pepperoni slices spicy enough to help it not be a completely bland bit of food.&nbsp; Still, after enjoying NYC pizza just a day before consuming this vending machine pizza, I wasn’t impressed.</p>

 <p>Then again, being able to spend $13 to get a personal pizza whenever I want in the middle of an empty airport at 1 a.m. is nice. If you ever find yourself stuck in the Detroit Metro Airport overnight and crave some food, look for the Pizza Cat vending machine, lower your standards, and enjoy a hot pizza pie. Or something approximating a pizza.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[There Are Still Some Surprisingly Good Deals On A Few Killer Switch Games Right Now]]></title>

              <p>The holidays are winding down. Did you get what you wanted? If not and you own a Switch or Switch 2, there’s a still a chance you can treat yourself to something for a decent price. Some of the best games of the year are currently on sale on the eShop, including <a href="https://kotaku.com/the-21-best-games-for-the-nintendo-switch-1794881447">some older ones that deserve a place</a> in everyone’s portable gaming library.</p> <p>Nintendo itself isn’t really running any great discounts on Switch exclusives at the moment. <em>Mario Odyssey</em> and <em>New Super Mario Bros. Deluxe</em> are both $20 off, but everyone probably already has those. There are some notable Switch 2 games on sale, including <em>Street Fighter 6</em> for just $20 (half off), <em>Star Wars Outlaws</em> for $40 (down from $60), and <em>Cyberpunk 2077</em> for $40 (down from $70).</p>

 <p>But if you only own a Switch, here’s a quick smattering of the best deals on the eShop for everything that’s available on both consoles:</p> <ul> <li><em><strong>No Man’s Sky</strong></em> – $24 (60 percent off)</li> <li><em><strong>Divinity: Original Sin 2</strong></em> – $25 (50 percent off)</li> <li><em><strong>Hollow Knight: Silksong</strong></em> – $16 (20 percent off)</li> <li><em><strong>Hades II</strong></em> – $22.50 (25 percent off)</li> <li><em><strong>Ball x Pit</strong></em> – $12 (20 percent off)</li> <li><em><strong>Prince of Persia The Lost Crown</strong></em> – $12 (60 percent off)</li> <li><em><strong>Death’s Door</strong> </em>– $5 (75 percent off)</li> <li><em><strong>Hollow Knight</strong> </em>– $7.50 (50 percent off)</li> <li><em><strong>Hades</strong> </em>– $ 7.50 (70 percent off)</li> <li><em><strong>Baten Kaitos 1 &amp; 2 HD Remaster</strong></em> – $15 (70 percent off)</li> <li><em><strong>Tactics Ogre: Reborn</strong> </em>– $20 (60 percent off)</li> <li><em><strong>Monster Hunter Rise</strong> </em>– $8 (80 percent off)</li> <li><em><strong>Mega Man Legacy Collection</strong></em> – $5 (66 percent off)</li> <li><em><strong>Final Fantasy VII</strong></em> – $6.39 (60 percent off)</li> <li><em><strong>Sifu</strong></em> – $10 (75 percent off)</li> <li><em><strong>Dead Cells</strong> </em>– $12.50 (50 percent off)</li> </ul> <p>The discounts on <em>Silksong</em> and <em>Hades 2</em> aren’t wild, but the games are already so cheap to begin with that it’s still enticing. And if you don’t have the games those are sequels to, you should grab them first since they’re a steal at just $15 for both. <em>Ball x Pit</em> is a great “shut your brain up” game for $12. <em>No Man’s Sky</em> just keeps getting bigger and bigger. And <em>Mega Man Legacy Collection</em> is a great way to get hyped <a href="https://kotaku.com/mega-man-dual-override-trailer-capcom-2000652829">for <em>Mega Man 12</em></a>, whenever that eventually arrives.</p>

 <p>But I want to call special attention to<em> Divinity: Original Sin 2</em>, which is the cheapest it’s ever going to be and just got a free upgrade for Switch 2. Now’s the time to get cracking on this dense tactical-RPG in preparation for the next <em>Divinity</em> sequel. <em>Baten Kaitos 1 &amp; 2 HD Remaster</em> is also a cult-classic RPG pick-up from the GameCube era that I’d recommend for just $15. And if you had fun with the <em>Final Fantasy Tactics</em> remaster this year, <em>Tactics Ogre: Reborn</em> is very good in similar but different ways. A perfectly grim and grindy strategy RPG for the dark, cold winter months.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Every Time Todd Howard Has Talked About Fallout 5]]></title>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>For years now, <em>Fallout</em> fans have been wondering when the next mainline sequel will arrive. Hype for the game most assume will be called<em> Fallout 5</em> grew even larger last year after Amazon’s TV show made the post-apocalyptic franchise bigger than ever. And while Bethesda hasn’t formally announced<em> Fallout 5</em>, that hasn’t stopped the studio’s creative director, Todd Howard, from talking about it over the years.</p> <p><em>Fallout 4</em> arrived on consoles and PC in 2015. Not long after its launch, people began wondering about<em> Fallout 5.</em> As a result, whenever Howard sits down for an interview, it’s not unusual for someone to ask him about <em>Fallout 5</em> and the future of the franchise. Here’s nearly every time Howard has talked about <em>Fallout 5</em>, presented in chronological order. One thing to keep in mind before scrolling down is that Howard is very careful when talking about <em>Fallout 5</em>, so be prepared for comments that give you plenty to infer and speculate about, but little in the way of cold hard facts.</p>

 <h2>June 2018 – <em>Fallout 5</em> will be a single-player video game</h2> <p>Technically, <a href="https://www.gamestar.de/videos/fallout-76-interview-mit-todd-howard-nicht-so-ein-krasser-umbruch-wie-bei-fallout-3-gamestar-tv-fuer-alle,96653.html">during a 2018 interview with German outlet <em>GameStar</em>,</a> Howard didn’t say anything specific about a new <em>Fallout</em> game. However, when asked if all upcoming Bethesda games would feature multiplayer like <em>Fallout 76,</em> he replied that no, future games from the studio would still be single-player adventures.</p>

 <h2>November 2021 – Bethesda has a <em>Fallout 5</em> “one-pager”</h2> <p>A few years later, during an <a href="https://youtu.be/LUOZsjTwbLU?t=1207">interview with <em>IGN</em></a>, Howard spilled a bit more about the next <em>Fallout</em> sequel. He told the outlet that Bethesda has a “one-pager on <em>Fallout 5</em>, what we want to do,” but made it clear that the plan at the time was <em>Starfield</em> and then <em>Elder Scrolls VI,</em> seemingly confirming that<em>&nbsp;Fallout 5</em> remained many, many years away.</p>

 <h2>June 2022 – <em>Fallout 5</em> is next after <em>The </em><em>Elder Scrolls VI</em></h2> <p>The following year, <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/starfield-new-details-todd-howard-interview">in another interview with <em>IGN</em></a>, Howard said this about Bethesda’s future:</p> <blockquote><p>“Yes, <em>Elder Scrolls 6</em> is in pre-production and, you know, we’re going to be doing<em> Fallout 5</em> after that, so our slate’s pretty full going forward for a while. We have some other projects that we look at from time to time as well.”</p></blockquote> <h2>June 2023 – <em>Fallout 5</em> might not be Bethesda’s next game after <em>Elder Scrolls 6</em></h2> <p>A year after saying <em>Fallout 5</em> would be Bethesda’s next project after shipping <em>Elder Scrolls VI,</em> <a href="https://youtu.be/0Gs22Sn2VMU?t=1166">Howard backtracked a bit</a> and clarified that he simply meant that <em>Fallout 5</em> would arrive after <em>The </em><em>Elder Scrolls 6</em>, not that he wanted to confirm it as the next game. This confusing backtrack worried fans who now wondered if Bethesda had a different project in the works that could further delay <em>Fallout 5. </em>In this same interview, he argued that long gaps between sequels, while annoying for fans, have rarely hurt a game’s success or quality.</p>

 <h2>March 2024 – <em>Fallout</em> TV showrunners were told to avoid certain details that will be in <em>Fallout 5</em></h2> <p>After causing a ruckus online by claiming that the<em> Fallout</em> TV show was “basically <em>Fallout 5,</em>” showrunner Johnathan Nolan clarified that he just meant this is the next story in the universe and not a replacement for an upcoming game. In fact, the show is actively avoiding some parts of the franchise <a href="https://kotaku.com/fallout-5-show-todd-howard-amazon-1851325762">because it would cause problems for <em>Fallout 5.</em></a></p>

 <p>“Well, there&nbsp;<em>were</em>&nbsp;some things where I said, ‘Don’t do this because we are going to do that in&nbsp;<em>Fallout 5</em>,’” Howard told <em><a href="https://www.denofgeek.com/tv/fallout-tv-series-todd-howard-fallout-5/">Den of Geek</a>.</em></p> <h2>April 2024 – Todd Howard dodges a question about <em>Fallout 5</em>‘s release after <em>The Elder Scrolls VI</em></h2> <p>When talking to <em>IGN</em>, Howard was yet again asked about <em>Fallout 5</em> launching after <em>The </em><em>Elder Scrolls 6</em>. This time,<a href="https://youtu.be/7dSeF1CMChs?t=1308"> he straight-up dodged the question</a>, but did confirm that Bethesda is working on different projects. “I’m going to avoid putting dates on anything, I’ve learned that the hard way,” said Howard. “So, obviously, you know, our focus as far as new development right now is <em>Elder Scrolls 6</em>, but that doesn’t mean that we’re not making plans for other things.”</p>

 <h2>June 2024 – Bethesda is not in a rush to release a new <em>Fallout</em> game</h2> <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/fallout-5-new-vegas-2-fo3-remaster-starfield-dlc-1851544120">During a 2024 interview with YouTuber MrMattyPlays,</a> Howard said that Bethesda didn’t feel the need to “rush out” a new <em>Fallout</em> sequel or spin-off, though he also acknowledged that the wait between<em> Fallout 4</em> and <em>Fallout 5</em> is growing longer and longer.</p> <blockquote><p>“Totally get the desire for a new kind of mainline single-player game. And look, those things take time. I don’t think it’s bad for people to miss things. We just want to get it right and make sure that everything we’re doing in a franchise, whether it’s <em>Elder Scrolls</em>,&nbsp;<em>Fallout</em>, or now<em>&nbsp;Starfield</em>, that those become meaningful moments for everybody who loved these franchises as much as we do.”</p></blockquote> <h2>October 2025 – Howard ends Fallout Day stream with a promise that more is being worked on</h2> <p>To celebrate Fallout Day, the day the bombs fell in-universe and destroyed the Earth, Bethesda held a digital showcase to announce a <em>Fallout 4</em> update, reveal some <em>Fallout 76</em> news, and not much else. Seemingly aware that this presentation would be disappointing to fans longing for <em>Fallout 5,</em> <a href="https://kotaku.com/todd-howard-bethesda-fallout-day-fallout-5-tease-event-remaster-2000638661">Howard appeared at the end</a> to offer some hope, telling fans that the studio is “working on even more” and that Bethesda is “looking forward to the day” when all is revealed.</p> <h2>December 2025 – Howard confirms <em>Fallout 5</em> won’t ignore the TV show</h2> <p><a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cvgr488vlmmo">In an interview with the <em>BBC</em></a>, Howard was asked if the events of the <em>Fallout</em> show are being considered by the devs while making <em>Fallout 5</em>. Would the show and the game really exist in one world?</p>

 <p>“In short, yes,” Howard told the outlet. “<em>Fallout 5</em> will be existing in a world where the stories and events of the show happened or are happening. We are taking that into account.”</p> <h2>December 2025 –&nbsp; Bethesda is still working hard on more <em>Fallout&nbsp;</em></h2> <p><a href="https://gameinformer.com/exclusive-interview/2025/12/23/bethesda-talks-fallouts-future-and-lessons-learned#:~:text=%22I%20will%20say,for%20our%20fans.%22">Speaking to <em>Game Informer</em>,</a> Howard made it clear that <em>Fallout</em> is a very important franchise for Bethesda and that it has been working on projects related to the post-apocalyptic world for a long time.</p> <blockquote><p>“I will say, first, looking at <em>76</em>, we’ve never stopped developing <em>Fallout</em>. We’ve had a full team on <em>Fallout</em> for a long time. So <em>Fallout</em>, as a franchise, is the one we’re still doing the most work in above anything. Now, the majority of our internal studio is on<em> Elder Scrolls VI.</em> We are doing other things with <em>Fallout</em> that we haven’t announced, and you know, there’ll come a time for that. I get the sort of anxiety from fans, like, ‘Well, what else? What else? Feed me!’ But, look, we’re working on stuff, and we do like to wait. And so, I think there’ll be a moment to talk about that, and we want to make those special moments for our fans.”</p></blockquote>
