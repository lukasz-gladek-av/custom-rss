              <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/best-creepypasta-what-is-backrooms-tiktok-steam-reddit-1850298058">Liminal spaces and the “backrooms”</a> have become overused concepts on the internet, with people labeling any room or area that is even slightly off as some creepy space. It’s annoying and tiring. But I still like the idea of eerie, dead areas hidden in our world in places like forgotten hallways and empty hotel rooms. I also like fast-paced boomer shooters that feel great. So I’m a big fan of the newly released indie FPS <em>Oddcore</em>, which mashes all of this stuff up into one stylish game.</p> <p><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2896260/ODDCORE/?curator_clanid=4777282">Out now on Steam via early access, <em>Oddcore</em></a> doesn’t have much setup. One moment you’re hanging out in a room in your house, watching TV, before you suddenly clip through reality and enter a strange multidimensional hubworld called Oddcore that acts as a demented spin on a theme park. Sort of. It’s all very, well, dare I say…odd! Though it’s unclear why you’ve ended up here or what “here” even means, it doesn’t really matter much once you get past the tutorial. All that matters is lasting as long as you can as you hop between different liminal spaces and strange dimensions, killing all the bizarre monsters you encounter along the way with guns, swords, special abilities, and much, much more.</p>

 <h2>What kind of game is <em>Oddcore</em>?</h2> <p>The basic loop in <em>Oddcore</em> involves you hopping into a space and then completing an objective. It might be to kill 10 enemies. Or collect seven strange items. Or to survive a corruption ambush that sends deadly giant faces at you. You know, the usual stuff. Survive, and you hop to a new place and repeat. Killing enemies earns you souls, which can be spent to extend how much time you have before your run ends or to heal you via shooting your own feet. Between every few worlds, there are vending machines that let you upgrade your gear or abilities, and random boxes that contain power-ups and other useful specials.</p>

  <p>Survive long enough, and you’ll earn tokens which can be spent in various ways. I spent most of mine at a slot machine inside a large arcade in the hub world. That slot machine spit out tickets if I got lucky, and I could use those to buy other pieces of gear. There’s actually a lot going on in <em>Oddcore</em>, and after just an hour or so of playing, I could feel it start to pull me into its web. I wanted to do just one more run…earn just a few more tokens…play just a little bit more.</p>

 <p>It also helps that <em>Oddcore</em> has primo aesthetics. It’s got that retro boomer shooter look I’ve come to expect from these kinds of games in 2026, but augments that with monsters and locations that seem out of place. I recommend turning on the VHS filter as it covers all of the strange art and retro visuals in cozy scanlines that add to the experience. But even without the VHS filter, <em>Oddcore</em> is a damn fine indie shooter that will hopefully only get bigger and better as it makes its way through early access.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><span>Listen, </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/lets-rank-the-main-resident-evil-games-from-worst-to-b-1847399290"><i><span>Resident Evil</span></i></a> <span>is clearly an influential series. It helped mold the enduring vision of survival-horror video games, and over the course of its nearly 30-year history, it has reinvented itself and the genre more times than one can count. There’s even an </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/resident-evil-requiem-9-capcom-grace-leon-2000632633"><span>exciting new </span><i><span>Resident Evil</span></i><span> title</span></a><span> coming out right around the series’ 30th anniversary, which feels like an appropriate thing to promote and throw some weight behind. So explain to me why, instead, there’s a </span><i><span>Resident Evil</span></i><span> knockoff called </span><i><span>Ebola Village </span></i><span>taking up time and space on PlayStation’s YouTube page right now?</span></p> <p><span>The trailer’s description reads, “A classic horror inspired by the original survival games of the 90s, Ebola Village is a modern take on a first-person adventure where the main character, Maria, investigates a series of mysterious events.” Let me just say, “inspired” is doing a lot of heavy lifting in that sentence. It’s been sitting on the official <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRM0AdPcs3E">PlayStation YouTube page</a> for over 20 hours, has amassed over 70,000 views, and roughly 7,400 downvotes. It was spotted online by <a href="https://x.com/Knoebelbroet/status/2008707623428792711">social media gaming news accounts like Knoebel</a>. “</span><span dir="auto" role="text">What are we doing here man,” reads one of the top comments.&nbsp;</span></p>

  <p><span><em>Ebola Village</em> already released on PC last year. Part of an entire series developed by “indie_games_studio” (yes, that’s the studio’s name), it costs $17 dollars and the top Steam reviews say things like, “This game is so bad it gave me Ebola irl.” Usually, it’s Unreal Engine asset-flip knockoffs of hit Steam games that are wasting space on the PlayStation Store. This time around, it’s actual junk from Steam that appears to be flowing downstream. How it ended up with a spot on the PlayStation YouTube channel remains unclear.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><span>The entire trailer feels like a shoddily constructed homage to the </span><i><span>Resident Evil</span></i><span> series, and not in a campy, fun way, either. One of the opening shots shows a character driving into town, and from the first-person perspective of the scene, their fingerless gloves look almost exactly like part of </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/resident-evil-requiem-leon-kennedy-grace-playable-split-2000653406"><span>Leon Kennedy</span></a><span>‘s </span><i><span>Resident Evil 4</span></i><span> fit. In another scene, a zombie (or someone otherwise infected by Ebola???) lobs an axe at the player’s head, and I swear the accompanying sound effect even sounds like it’s straight out of </span><i><span>RE4</span></i><span>.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">I wonder if this trailer will be still available on the official PlayStation YT acc after I wake up tomorrow. <a href="https://t.co/9CKCMwnle8">pic.twitter.com/9CKCMwnle8</a></p> <p>— Knoebel (@Knoebelbroet) <a href="https://twitter.com/Knoebelbroet/status/2008707623428792711?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 7, 2026</a></p></blockquote>  <p><span>To make matters worse (or better depending on who you ask), there’s also an enemy with a chainsaw and sack over their head. Come on, y’all.</span></p> <p><i><span>RE4</span></i><span> isn’t the only game from the series that’s shown a bit of love here, and there are some standout “homages” to the larger </span><i><span>RE </span></i><span>series among the various egregious details. For example, the font used for </span><i><span>Ebola Village</span></i><span>‘s title appears very similar to that used by the </span><i><span>Resident Evil</span></i><span> remakes, and the “E” in Ebola here is crimson followed by gnarled white lettering, mirroring the logos for those games. Additionally, the main character, Maria, feels pretty “inspired”</span> <span>by the series’ early female protagonists, like some amalgamation of Claire Redfield and Jill Valentine.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><span>At some point in the game, Maria even appears to flee to a remote village to “visit her mother and her ex-husband, Ruslan,” at which point the game begins to look eerily like the </span><i><span>RE4</span></i><span>-inspired </span><i><span>Resident Evil Village</span></i><span>. There’s a tall crone-like character, a fight with a werewolf, and there are even scenes set amongst distinctly </span><i><span>Village</span></i><span>-esque cabins. The most surprising part of the trailer is actually the absence of a Lady Dimitrescu analog, but maybe that’s one surprise <em>Ebola Village</em> is saving for those brave enough to actually spend money on it.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><span>Some commenters on the trailer page couldn’t help but theorize that the video’s thumbnail was AI-generated, which would at least feel in line with the </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/ps5-psn-playstation-store-ai-slop-brainrot-junk-spam-1851786494"><span>rest of the slop currently sitting on the PlayStation Store</span></a><span>. According to the game’s Steam page, it was indeed the work of a neural network. </span><i><span>Ebola Village</span></i><span> is evidently releasing on console on January 23, and I cannot wait to see what </span><i><span>borrowed </span></i><span>tricks it has up its sleeves, at least until <em>Ebola 4</em> comes out. We’ll see if that one makes it into an actual PlayStation showcase.&nbsp;</span></p>
