              <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/overwatch-cinematic-doomfist-vendetta-death-reign-talon-2000665013"><i><span>Overwatch</span></i><span>’s</span></a><span> character design has </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/overwatch-2-oddball-aspirational-character-hero-design-2000617761"><span>gotten a bit homogeneous</span></a><span> over the years, and </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/overwatch-heroes-characters-hotter-young-skins-collab-2000665796"><span>fans have taken notice of it</span></a><span>. Specifically, the women of Blizzard’s hero shooter have suffered from a bit of “same face syndrome” for years, with characters like Widowmaker, Ashe, and Freja being nearly identical in some skins. However, it’s gotten especially bad for the game’s East Asian heroes since Kiriko came onto the scene in 2022. Now Anran, one of the new heroes joining the game next week, is the latest victim of this phenomenon.</span></p>  <p><span>Anran is a fire-wielding hero and the sister of the game’s </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/overwatch-2-wuyang-trial-trailer-story-gameplay-voice-2000616929"><span>water-bending support hero Wuyang</span></a><span>. As such, she appeared in animated trailers, comics, and other lore before she was implemented into the game itself. Before her in-game appearance, she was depicted with a longer nose and sharper features, and overall had a distinct face compared to other characters on the roster. Now that we’ve seen her in the game itself, however, fans have pointed out that her face is much more round and her nose has been shrunken down to the same button nose Kiriko and Juno have.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">the audible sigh I let out <a href="https://t.co/0HYZoKjiB7">pic.twitter.com/0HYZoKjiB7</a></p> <p>— Dahja 🐧 (@Dahja3D) <a href="https://twitter.com/Dahja3D/status/2019101290928947499?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">February 4, 2026</a></p></blockquote>  <p><span>The similarities are so striking that some fans are joking she looks like she’s an alternate skin for Kiriko. The comparison between Anran’s old face and her new one is pretty stark, but seeing Kiriko or Juno’s face next to her current appearance is when the issue really becomes apparent. She looks less like Wuyang’s sister than she once did.</span></p> <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">how do you have a team of artists and still end up with same face syndrome as bad as this .

            <title><![CDATA[Nintendo Covers Up Violence With Hilariously Bad Gameplay]]></title>
            <link>https://kotaku.com/nintendo-direct-leon-kennedy-gameplay-footage-violence-2000666127</link>
            <guid>1427443</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><span>Usually, trailers for upcoming games tend to show good gameplay. You know, things like attacks that land and shots that actually hit their targets—stuff that might get players excited about the idea of being </span><i><span>good </span></i><span>at a game. But when promoting two of the biggest third-party games coming to Switch, Nintendo has thrown that idea out the window, presumably to avoid sullying its family-friendly image with gory violence.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>During Thursday’s </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/nintendo-direct-february-switch-2-oblivion-fallout-2000665999"><span>Nintendo Partner Direct</span></a><span>, Nintendo showed off </span><i><span>Resident Evil Requiem</span></i><span> and </span><i><span>Indiana Jones and the Great Circle</span></i><span>, two games headed to its new portable console in the next few months. What stood out most about these segments wasn’t the visual quality of the two blockbusters running on less powerful hardware, however, but how terrible whoever was capturing the footage was at playing the games.</span></p>

 <figure id="attachment_2000666131" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000666131"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000666131">Bethesda</figcaption></figure> <p><span>The Direct’s trailers for both games were full of missed shots and poorly-timed attacks, as pointed out by former </span><i><span>Kotaku</span></i><span> EIC </span><a href="https://bsky.app/profile/stephentotilo.bsky.social/post/3me4ntqnrns2l"><span>Stephen Totilo</span></a> <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/apzonerunner.com/post/3me4mfg3mak2j"><span>and others</span></a><span>. One shot from the </span><i><span>Requiem </span></i><span>trailer showed Leon Kennedy picking up a zombie’s chainsaw to fight off enemies only to miss and hit the railing on a bed, causing sparks to fly. Another shot from the </span><i><span>Great Circle </span></i><span>trailer showed Indiana Jones missing a boat full of Nazis and hitting the water below them instead.</span><span><br> </span><span><br> </span><span>The </span><i><span>Requiem </span></i><span>trailer is especially funny to watch—the narrator raves about Leon’s “physical prowess” and how “he can fire from a distance using handguns and rifles” over clips of him missing shots by literal feet. Compared to </span><a href="https://youtu.be/T54OWinnymM?si=L4rujiQUA9nYDYd2"><span>a recent Capcom trailer for <em>Requiem</em></span></a><span>, which has no problem showing some pretty graphic stuff, it seems clear Nintendo went out of its way to hide the violence in its latest showcase.&nbsp;</span></p> <figure id="attachment_2000666132" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000666132"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000666132">Capcom</figcaption></figure> <p><span>Nintendo hasn’t been very keen on showing violence in previous Directs, either. When it announced a Switch port of </span><i><span>The Witcher 3 </span></i><span>during its </span><a href="https://youtu.be/Zr9eAtwcYlo?si=zAk1fiwKEOnXWZTo"><span>Direct at E3 2019</span></a><span>, it edited out a clip of the game’s notorious hanging tree that </span><a href="https://youtu.be/BAC-jqZTCv8?si=b_IcTCmAfUTeP4lj"><span>was shown in online uploads of the trailer in some regions</span></a><span>.</span></p>

 <p><span>Other trailers for more violent games that have been ported onto Nintendo systems, like </span><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ijqVBkgZ79Y&amp;pp=ygUaY3liZXJwdW5rIHN3aXRjaCAyIHRyYWlsZXI%3D"><i><span>Cyberpunk 2077</span></i></a><span>, have received more atmospheric trailers that avoid showing gameplay. Some trailers haven’t been shown at all. The </span><a href="https://youtu.be/ztMGTTAjsAQ?si=PSgtM6Au08YQdbM1"><span>2017 Direct announcement</span></a><span> for </span><i><span>Wolfenstein 2</span></i><span>, a shooter about murdering tons of Nazis, lacked a trailer entirely and was revealed only with a still image of key art. And, during the same Direct, gameplay for </span><i><span>Doom </span></i><span>featured more apparently intentionally bad gameplay, clips in which the player fires off to the side of enemies without landing any hits alongside one shot where the player is about to be attacked and…does nothing at all.</span></p>

 <figure id="attachment_2000666133" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000666133"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000666133">CD Projekt Red</figcaption></figure> <p><span>Contrast that with how the developers themselves sometimes show their games being played on Nintendo’s consoles. </span><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CN7VJ1zec0g"><span>Here’s a CD Projekt Red trailer</span></a><span> for </span><i><span>Cyberpunk 2: Ultimate Edition</span></i><span> showing off Joy-Con motion controls. It shows a woman mimicking the real-life hand gesture to throw a grenade whose explosion proceeds to decapitate the enemy on screen. Later she frantically slashes the air to slice through enemies with a katana. No one in the video misses a single kill and they’re all smiling while they do it.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>Putting smiles on players’ faces is Nintendo’s corporate mission, but not with bullets and blood, apparently, at least when the Nintendo Direct cameras are rolling. We don’t have confirmation from Nintendo that it’s an intentional policy, but it’s certainly a recurring theme. However, it’s clear that Nintendo at least has a complicated relationship with the trailers for M-rated games, more of which are getting ported to Switch 2 every day.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><span>While today was certainly an embarrassing day for poor Leon Kennedy, as a big gamer who could definitely be a </span><i><span>better </span></i><span>gamer myself, I at least felt a little represented by the horrible gameplay shown off.&nbsp;</span></p>

              <p>For over a year, buying booster packs of <em>Pokémon</em> cards on the official Pokémon Center website has required either the most extraordinary luck, or a bot. When new stock is added to the site, it very quickly collapses under the weight of incoming traffic, leading to error messages or queues that never resolve. Any who do manage to get in before the site goes down are limited by strict purchase restrictions, except of course for those running the bots that are able to scoop up the stock in milliseconds. So was today’s peculiar decision to bundle the enormously popular Surging Sparks booster boxes with the never-wanted and very bulky Pokémon Academy boxes a deliberate troll of the scalpers by The Pokémon Company?</p> <p>Surging Sparks is the set that’s generally considered to be the beginning of the current frenzy that’s seen <a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-magic-the-gathering-scalpers-cards-2000632017">Pokémon cards become almost impossible to buy</a> for the last 15 months, where rocketing resale prices have led to scalping ruining the hobby for so many, and indeed <a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-tcg-theft-card-store-phantasmal-flames-2000651666">strings</a> of <a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-card-shops-robbed-100k-nyc-masked-thieves-anime-backpacks-recently-opened-2000660233">robberies</a> at <a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-store-poke-court-nyc-manhattan-robbery-donation-2000662652">many specialist retailers</a> around the world. Its <a href="https://www.pokemoncenter.com/product/BUNDLE1157/scarlet-and-violet-surging-sparks-booster-display-box-and-battle-academy-bundle">restock today on the U.S. Pokémon Center website</a> was therefore something of a surprise—occurring without promotion and of course inevitably selling out before most were aware it was even happening. Except, rather than these 36-pack containers appearing for the usual price of around $160, today’s booster boxes were all bundled with the latest edition of the Battle Academy, a hefty $20 box that’s designed to introduce new players to the table-top card game, and all for the undiscounted price of $180.</p>

 <p>If you’re already familiar with the&nbsp;<em>Pokémon TCG</em>, you’ve likely already snorted a laugh at this. For everyone else, it’s important to know that the Battle Academy is to <em>Pokémon</em> cards what the Fisher Price telephone is to the iPhone. It contains a chunky playing board, push-out cardboard counters, and three 60-card decks with special, numbered cards that don’t feature the standard <em>Pokémon&nbsp;</em>card back designs, nor even a single holo among them. Even better, the Battle Academy hasn’t been updated in so many years that they still sport the late 2010’s Pokémon V cards. They are, in the scheme of collecting, worthless.</p> <p>This has to be a troll, right? While it won’t have cost any more in shipping (the Pokémon Center is unreasonably good on this, waiving shipping costs for purchases over $20), it’s going to be such an epic pain in the ass for the scalpers, as their every shipment arrives with this enormous extra box of stuff they don’t want or need, and most of all, cannot resell. It’s an extra $20 too, which is just enjoyably inconvenient.</p>

 <p>You could argue that this is also screwing over legitimate customers, and that’s sadly true. However, for independent card stores being repeatedly let down by The Pokémon Company’s official retail suppliers (according to multiple store owners I’ve spoken to in the UK since stock shortages began, the company is allegedly prioritizing larger retail chains over them) it’s a fantastic deal, given they can also sell the Battle Academy boxes to their younger customers.</p>

 <p>It’d be far better to see the Pokémon Center website actually spending the money to build an infrastructure that can cope when it stocks new TCG cards, but in the meantime, if this really was a way to just irritate scalpers, it’s hard not to give over a little kudos.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/horizon-hunters-gathering-colorful-three-player-co-op-game-ps5-pc-trailer-2000666041">Earlier today, PlayStation and Guerrilla revealed </a><em><a href="https://kotaku.com/horizon-hunters-gathering-colorful-three-player-co-op-game-ps5-pc-trailer-2000666041">Horizon Hunters Gathering</a>,</em> the next entry in the popular post-apocalyptic franchise. But this spin-off is a multiplayer-focused online co-op action game that looks a lot like<em> Monster Hunter</em> meets <em>Destiny</em>. It will receive updates post-launch, and oh, wait, this is a live-service game. Oh no, this was a bad time to announce <em>Hunters Gathering</em>.</p> <p>I’m not sure a colorful, cartoonish online-only spin-off of the photorealistic solo single-player open-world series <em>Horizon</em> would have been a smash hit with terminally online fans at any point. But right now, of all times, feels one of the worst possible moments to reveal <em>Hunters Gathering</em> to a world wide web primed to make a Kombucha Girl face at everything it’s doing. The last two years have been littered with the corpses of failed, cancelled, or still-dying live-service games. A lot of players are, understandably, tired of these things and unsure of whether they should even invest any time into caring, as so many seem to flop or shut down.</p>

 <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">The hunt is on.</p> <p>Step into the world of Horizon Hunters Gathering, a new co-op action game from Guerrilla coming to PS5 and PC: <a href="https://t.co/TNWH4oRX2Q">https://t.co/TNWH4oRX2Q</a> <a href="https://t.co/BCjSquv30R">pic.twitter.com/BCjSquv30R</a></p> <p>— PlayStation (@PlayStation) <a href="https://twitter.com/PlayStation/status/2019425896008974566?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">February 5, 2026</a></p></blockquote>  <p>It was just last month that <a href="https://kotaku.com/highguard-the-kotaku-review-is-it-good-free-ps5-pc-5v5-3v3-update-patch-2000664646"><em>Highguard</em></a> launched and <a href="https://kotaku.com/highguard-already-has-over-7000-negative-reviews-on-steam-2000663220">was then immediately trashed</a> by a large portion of players. The live-service PvP shooter debuted at the Game Awards, launched with over 90k active players on Steam, and now, less than two weeks after launch, is struggling to reach 5,000 players and is nowhere to be seen on any of my social feeds. Before that, <em>Concord</em>, a previous attempt by Sony to make a live-service game, <a href="https://kotaku.com/concord-shutting-down-closing-servers-refunds-ps5-1851638566">infamously crashed and burned in less than two weeks</a>. <em>Marathon</em>, the next game from PlayStation-owned Bungie, <a href="https://kotaku.com/marathon-delay-bungie-feedback-prox-chat-solo-update-1851784674">has had a very rocky rollout</a> ever since it confirmed it was an online-only live-service experience, making me nervous about its future even as sentiment online seems to be slowly rebounding in its favor.</p> <p>There are so many more live-service games that seem to be struggling to exist in an era when most people are just playing <a href="https://kotaku.com/pc-gaming-newzoo-balatro-helldivers-2-gdc-time-spent-1851771352"><em>Roblox, Fortnite, GTA Online, </em>or <em>DOTA 2</em> forever</a>. As reported by <em>TheGamer,</em> <a href="https://www.thegamer.com/2025-live-service-games-player-analysis/">many of the live-service games launched in 2025 have lost most of their players</a>, according to SteamDB. And while there are a few recent exceptions, like <em>Arc Raiders</em> and <em>Marvel Rivals</em>, it is really, really hard to break into the market and stay around. Even brief bright spots, like last year’s mini-breakout MOBA <em>Supervine</em>, <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/moba/another-moba-gives-up-supervive-developed-by-former-riot-devs-is-closing-in-february-just-7-months-after-it-launched/">eventually lose steam</a>.</p>

 <p>All of these attempts to carve out a sustainable multiplayer niche over the last two years have whittled down players’ patience. At this point, every live-service multiplayer thing gets dunked on relentlessly the moment it’s announced. Sure, some of that negativity is just assholes drafting off the “hate everything” digital ecosystems on TikTok and YouTube. But a lot of it is also just people tired of more games that ask a ton of their players without first earning it, only to eventually pay it back with a shutdown notice screenshot on social media.</p>

 <p>This is the environment that Sony has announced <em>Horizon Hunters Gathering</em> into, and it shouldn’t shock anyone that a lot of the reactions to the game are people saying they have zero interest or actively calling it bad. Can you blame them? The last two years have shown that live-service games are prone to failure, likely to collapse shortly after launch, and not worth checking out if you already play one or two of them, like <em>Fortnite</em>. Maybe that’s why they slipped it out in a PlayStation Blog post instead of a proper State of Play showcase.</p> <p>So, while I think <em>Hunters Gathering</em> looks neat and could be fun, I’m well aware that one day I’ll likely be writing a story about how it’s no longer getting updates and is shutting off the in-game microtransaction shop. You’ll read that headline on X or Reddit, go “Oh right, that game…” and then just keep scrolling by. It’s hard to get too excited about a new game, even from a PlayStation studio, when that fate already feels sealed. Maybe especially from a PlayStation studio.</p>

              <p><span>You know, if you’re ever looking for an example of the power of human artistry, you can typically look to incredible sculptures and statues that depict the human form like </span><i><span>David </span></i><span>by Michelangelo or the work of Rodin. But these pieces have the advantage of not being mass produced for people to buy and stick on the Nintendo system to unlock cosmetics. The </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/resident-evil-9-requiem-leon-infection-dead-dies-theory-2000663084"><span>Leon Kennedy</span></a> <a href="https://kotaku.com/resident-evil-9-requiem-preview-leon-gameplay-grace-2000662270"><i><span>Resident Evil Requiem</span></i></a><span> amiibo doesn’t have such luxuries, but it nonetheless accomplishes something remarkable as well: it somehow finally makes the zombie-shooting heartthrob ugly.</span></p> <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">Requiem for the dead. Nightmare for the living.<br>Grace Ashcroft and Leon S. Kennedy join the amiibo family in summer 2026.</p> <p>Amiibo will be sold separately. <a href="https://t.co/zOfUuU3IH3">pic.twitter.com/zOfUuU3IH3</a></p> <p>— Resident Evil (@RE_Games) <a href="https://twitter.com/RE_Games/status/2019420370554745295?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">February 5, 2026</a></p></blockquote>   <p><span>That’s not to say that the Grace Ashcroft figure is much better. Both of them look like cheap wedding cake toppers. Amiibos typically feature more stylized characters like most of Nintendo’s heroes, so they don’t often have to be very detailed. </span><i><span>Resident Evil Requiem</span></i><span>, however, is a photorealistic game that would lend itself to a more detailed statue. These figures’ faces are so generic-looking that if it weren’t for Leon’s distinctive swooping hair, I probably would have a hard time identifying him. And trust me, I’ve looked at his face extensively for decades. Where is his old man scruff?</span></p>

 <p><span>“Reading the comments I feel like I’m taking crazy pills, but I must admit I’m not familiar with Amiibo and their usual quality,” Nexxtic wrote on </span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/residentevil/comments/1qwmppb/nintendo_just_revealed_amiibo_for_both_grace_and/"><span>Reddit</span></a><span>. “Are they always this… rough? I think these look pretty bad, especially Leon. Like one of those bad Switch ports.”</span></p> <p><span>“Grace seems nice, Leon a little less so,” wrote AdResponsible5888.</span></p> <p><span>If nothing else, the existence of a Leon amiibo—a goofy looking one at that—means we get good jokes. Even if a lot of them have the same punchline.</span></p>   <p><span>Hopefully these aren’t the expensive $40+ amiibo, and are in the $15-20 range. They’re both coming out after </span><i><span>Requiem</span></i><span>’s launch, with the game itself arriving later this month on February 27 and both figures launching in the summer.</span></p>
