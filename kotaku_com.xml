            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>In nearly every cozy game under the sun that I’ve spent far too long playing, fishing is the one mechanic that’s omnipresent yet differs just enough between games to prove annoying. It’s also usually the one minigame that makes me pull out my beard in frustration. In <em>Rune Factory: Guardians of Azuma</em>, you won’t unlock fishing straight away, but once you do, it can feel like quite the game-changer for food supplies, income, and collectors who want to see it all. So it’s well worth investing some time in getting better at luring in those fish.</p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="197589" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="Ring Psychology: Understanding The 6 Phases Of A Wrestling Match Through Heel Era John Cena" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="659" data-playlist="197589,197586,197585" data-current="197589"><div><p>Ring Psychology: Understanding The 6 Phases Of A Wrestling Match Through Heel Era John Cena</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197589/197589_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197589/197589_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197589/197589_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/23110.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><h2 id="h40832"><a id=""></a>How to fish</h2><p>You’ll unlock the fishing mechanic after arriving at Winter Village, shortly after the initial cutscene introducing the new characters and setting. You’ll find Watarase, the fisherman, down beneath the main bridge. He owns a small hovel by the water, with a fishing dock out over the rapids. You really cannot miss him, as he’s the only person wearing a fish head for a hat.</p><p>Once he provides you with your PescaPedia—a journal to track the types of fish you catch—along with a fishing rod, he’ll point you toward the water. Open up your map now. You’ll note jumping fish-shaped icons marking key points around town, specifically over the water, which indicate fishing holes. If you visit each one, you’ll find shadows dancing in the water and, by standing close, you may cast your line into the immediate area.</p><figure id="" data-id="37880dea685fec37f5522b52821fcb50" data-recommend-id="image://37880dea685fec37f5522b52821fcb50" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Catching a fish at a fishing hole in Rune Factory: Guardians of Azuma." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Catching a fish at a fishing hole in Rune Factory: Guardians of Azuma." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Marvelous / Brandon Morgan / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="37880dea685fec37f5522b52821fcb50" data-recommend-id="image://37880dea685fec37f5522b52821fcb50" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Catching a fish at a fishing hole in Rune Factory: Guardians of Azuma." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>With your fishing line in the water, wait patiently.

Is there room in the entertainment world for that kind of stance?”</p><p><em>Assassin’s Creed Shadows </em>released back in March and is currently the third-best-selling game of 2025.

The veteran executive provided no juicy soundbites in response, but did defend <em>Assassin’s Creed Shadows</em> in general terms, and the creative choices of its development team, as he has done in the past. </p><p>“Obviously, with regard to this particular game, what was our goal?” Guillemot said. “We wanted to showcase characters with heroic journeys. Everybody wants to play a hero’s journey. You shift your circumstances, and you become something more, and it’s a very powerful expectation from games. This is a hero quest, and it doesn’t just apply to Ubisoft or [unintelligible]… This is an actual character. This is someone who really existed.

Guillemot pointed to franchises like <em>Anno </em>and <em>Rayman</em>, but it sounds like the company will remain focused on its biggest blockbusters. </p><p>.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://kotaku.com/assassins-creed-shadows-woke-stop-killing-games-1851786587]]></content:encoded>

It was also the most extraordinary take on what was, after all, an X-Men story, despite never uttering those words, nor even alluding to the wider franchise. The story of David Haller (Dan Stevens), the schizophrenic son of Charles Xavier (although he is never named either), explored his attempts to come to terms with his powers and his mental illness, accompanied by the unknowable reality of Aubrey Plaza’s Lenny, all while being pursued by the astoundingly sinister Amahl Farouk (Navid Negahban). It was like nothing else on TV. (The above is a genuine scene from the TV show, not a compilation or trailer. It was this fantastic.) And <em>that</em>’s why I’m so hyped for <em>Alien: Earth</em>.</p><p>Hints of the possible weirdness have appeared throughout the <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLIDyzBpnfjqkmoQqUBXKeRF7zmfLe3HT0&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLIDyzBpnfjqkmoQqUBXKeRF7zmfLe3HT0" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">promotional campaign</a></span> for the series, not least a full three minutes of a cat’s eye view of a Weyland-Yutani ship:</p><p>But somewhat less overtly, there have been multiple trailers featuring shots so distinctive from Hawley’s shows; sparse, symmetrical spaces, intercutting shots of idyllic nature with barren, metallic greys. There’s so much potential here for headfuckery, peculiar flashbacks/forwards that can sit unexplained for episodes at a time, and visual flare that will speak far more potently than the scripts.</p><p>Or, of course, it could be terrible. No one knows yet. But I have such high hopes. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/alien-earth-trailer-fx-sydney-chandler-samuel-blenkin-1851783707?_gl=1*cs6p7h*_ga*NjgyMDU5NjUzLjE3NTAwODIwMTA.*_ga_V4QNJTT5L0*czE3NTI4NDI5MDMkbzYwJGcxJHQxNzUyODQzMTM4JGo1OCRsMCRoMA..&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/alien-earth-trailer-fx-sydney-chandler-samuel-blenkin-1851783707?_gl=1*cs6p7h*_ga*NjgyMDU5NjUzLjE3NTAwODIwMTA.*_ga_V4QNJTT5L0*czE3NTI4NDI5MDMkbzYwJGcxJHQxNzUyODQzMTM4JGo1OCRsMCRoMA..">Last month we had a trailer</a></span> that stopped holding back and introduced us to the idea that the the Weyland ship that crashes into an North America’s Prodigy City isn’t just carrying a Xenomorph, but at least four other alien species.

The young girl whose mind is transferred into a synth body—she’s not questioning her humanity. The alien creatures we know have escaped on board the crashed ship? We now see their eggs, their victims, and a whole lot more blood. And most of all, if you’re me and geeking out about this, we see a constant flip-flopping between sci-fi metallic horror and comfortable, Earthly bucolic nature. Right up until that final shot, the incredibly subtle yet striking image of a Xenomorph lit by natural light.</p><figure id="" data-id="e0cf4c42efe9583fd0f25ecefdea182d" data-recommend-id="image://e0cf4c42efe9583fd0f25ecefdea182d" data-format="jpg" data-width="1827" data-height="1028" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A Xenomorph out of the entrance of a cave, lit by the sun." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A Xenomorph out of the entrance of a cave, lit by the sun." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->FX / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="e0cf4c42efe9583fd0f25ecefdea182d" data-recommend-id="image://e0cf4c42efe9583fd0f25ecefdea182d" data-format="jpg" data-width="1827" data-height="1028" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A Xenomorph out of the entrance of a cave, lit by the sun." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>When did you last see a Xenomorph lit by natural light?</p><p>Oh, and talking of progression between the trailers, we need to talk about the poor goat.

Not least, based on this being set two years before the original movie, you’re forced to wonder how much was known about the Xenomorphs ahead of Ripley’s first encounter in 2122. Now, forgive me, because I’m no expert in this franchise (obviously <em>Alien</em> and <em>Aliens</em> are masterpieces in their own distinct ways, but the rest of the movies really don’t bear all that much scrutiny in my opinion), but I’ve tried to piece this all together. And for the record, the <em>Alien Vs. Predator</em> movies are not canon, as Ridley Scott made sure of by the story he told in <em>Prometheus</em>.</p><p>2012's <em>Prometheus </em>was set in 2093, at which point it’s made clear that Xenomorphs are yet to exist. <em>Alien: Covenant</em>, released in 2017, is set in 2104, just 16 years before this TV show, and now—as a result of experiments with fungal spores on an alien planet—it seems they do. But they’re nowhere near Earth, and it’s unclear whether or not anyone could have reported back about them. The next chronological movie is <em>Alien</em>, which of course was not created to be part of some enormous franchise spanning the timeline in either direction, and so gave no thought to where or why the Xenomorphs existed. But it <em>does</em> reveal that the as-yet unnamed corporation had deliberately sent the Nostromo out to encounter the aliens.</p><p>So, this all suggests that <em>Alien: Earth</em> is going to explain how Weyland-Yutani knew to go look for the buggers: they literally encountered them on the planet’s surface. That’s quite a twist! It also leaves huge questions about those other four species! Why have we never encountered any of these again in the <em>four</em> other films that take place after <em>Alien</em>? Obviously <em>Aliens</em> takes care of itself, in its own contained story, but what about <em>Romulus</em>? That’s set on a Weyland experimental ship, but here they’re only focused on the Xenos. And sure, the more we can forget <em>Alien 3</em> and <em>Alien Resurrection</em> the better, but the latter is set another 200 years later on and <em>still</em> doesn’t suggest other lifeforms are out there.</p><p>It’s obviously tempting to just say, “Dude, who cares? It’s a sci-fi story and they’re just making shit up as they go.” And yes, that’s absolutely true. But people take canon and continuity <em>really</em> seriously, especially in nerdcore like this. It would, I think, be a bit lazy to set a TV show in such a crucial moment in the mythos’ history and act like what comes next isn’t important. It seems very unlikely that’s the plan. Hence why it’s so interesting to speculate!</p><p>The show is going to be on FX and Hulu, starting August 12 with two episodes. After that, it’ll come out on a weekly schedule, like TV used to in the olden days, with eight episodes total finishing on September 23.</p><p>Clearly I’m way too excited for it.</p><p>.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://kotaku.com/alien-earth-noah-hawley-fx-tv-series-trailer-scott-1851786549]]></content:encoded>

This sound was attached to hundreds of videos on my feed before I ever actually saw one of these dolls, but now that the trend has broken containment, I see one of these little guys everywhere I look. Though Labubu were initially just dolls like any other, they’ve seen an uptick as a fashion accessory in the past couple of years, with Lisa, one of the members of K-pop group Blackpink, being cited as one of the major trendsetters who’s sparked the brand’s worldwide success.</p><p>Lisa has been considered one of the first trailblazers for the brand ever since she <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.instagram.com/p/DKDqLV2IcZB/?img_index=3&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.instagram.com/p/DKDqLV2IcZB/?img_index=3" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">posted photos of herself sporting a Labubu keychain on her bag</a></span> on social media in April 2024, and then other huge celebrities followed suit.

It may seem like Labubu is an overnight success, but the dolls have been in production for a decade. The brand was introduced in 2015 under the company How2Work, based on a character design by artist <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.prestigeonline.com/th/people/kasing-lung-artist-labubu-the-monsters-pop-mart/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.prestigeonline.com/th/people/kasing-lung-artist-labubu-the-monsters-pop-mart/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Kasing Lung</a></span>, who illustrated children’s books with the company. The brand had another surge in popularity in 2019 when it started collaborating with Pop Mart, a Chinese blind box store. All of this was a perfect storm for Labubu to become not only a worldwide phenomenon, but the kind of collectathon craze that rivals something like <em>Pokémon </em>cards. How do you make something desirable? Make it harder to find. It’s also made unboxing videos a popular viral trend as people try to track down the rare “secret” doll in a blind box.</p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="197589" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="Ring Psychology: Understanding The 6 Phases Of A Wrestling Match Through Heel Era John Cena" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="659" data-playlist="197589,197586,197585" data-current="197589"><div><p>Ring Psychology: Understanding The 6 Phases Of A Wrestling Match Through Heel Era John Cena</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197589/197589_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197589/197589_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197589/197589_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/23110.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>The craze has grown so much that Labubu is now collaborating with some huge brands.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>In the east coast heat of the summer of 2013, I stood outside of a particular McDonald’s in Forest Hills, NY, in a dazed state of shock. I had just come out to some friends—I actually said it out loud, but all that had to wait because at the same time, I had also just learned that the PS4’s upcoming DualShock 4 controller would come with digital face buttons, not pressure-sensitive analog ones like Sony controllers did for two console generations prior. I looked up at my friends, who were ready to support me through that other thing I just told them. But I started shaking my head and said, “How am I going to play <em>Metal Gear</em> without analog buttons?”</p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="197567" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="Nintendo Switch 2 Price Is Set at $450 for Now, But Could Go Higher" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="104" data-playlist="197567,196181,196230" data-current="197567"><div><p>Nintendo Switch 2 Price Is Set at $450 for Now, But Could Go Higher</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197567/197567_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197567/197567_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197567/197567_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/23091.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>It’s a true story: The DualShock 4 did not ship with analog buttons for X, square, circle, triangle, L1, R1, or on the D-pad. And, sure, I knew then that the upcoming <em>MGSV </em>would be fine, since, like <em>MGS4 </em>before it, the series would surrender to third-person-shooter L2 = Aim, R2 = Shoot supremacy. Thanks, <em>Gears of War</em>. The Xbox 360 also surrendered the analog buttons that appeared on its predecessor (the OG Xbox used the feature even less than PS2). So, with the PS4 forgoing the tech, it was clearly dead.</p><p>The feeling of what it was like to aim or lean and peek in <em>MGS2</em> or <em>MGS3</em> via pressure sensitivity features on the PS2 controller was an essential part of the <em>Metal Gear </em>experience for me. And now that I’m replaying <em>MGS3</em> via the recently released <em>Master Collection</em>, it’s kind of stunning how much my brain desires this level of analog input. It’s almost painful, despite it <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://youtu.be/clH5Q5QcOcg&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://youtu.be/clH5Q5QcOcg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">not being there</a></span></p><p>Analog control has been around in video games for a long time, from joysticks on old arcade cabinets to modern motion sensitivity on Joy-Con and DualSense controllers. One of the first appearances of the tech was on the original PlayStation via <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NeGcon#&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NeGcon#" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Namco’s NeGcon</a></span>, which allowed for analog steering in games like <em>WipEout</em>, but it also featured a pair of “I” and “II” buttons, which stood a bit taller and allowed for pressure sensitivity. This feature would ship as a standard part of the PS2’s DualShock 2 controller. Games indicated support for the feature by way of a “Pressure Sensitive” badge on the back of the box. Manuals would refer to the functionality by telling you to “press firmly” for certain functions.</p><p>Pressure sensitivity <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.giantbomb.com/pressure-sensitivity/3015-2671/games/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.giantbomb.com/pressure-sensitivity/3015-2671/games/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">wasn’t used terribly often in PS2 games</a></span>. Standouts include <em>GTA</em> and <em>Gran Turismo</em> for driving at different speeds, <em>SOCOM II</em>, which saw your character crouch with a light tap of a button, and go prone with a firm press. But two games that embraced it the most, I’d argue (aside from <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.giantbomb.com/mad-maestro/3030-12108/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.giantbomb.com/mad-maestro/3030-12108/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">that one rhythm game</a></span> that <em>requires</em> it), were <em>MGS2</em> and <em>MGS3</em>. </p><p>In these <em>MGS</em> games, you’d hold square to aim your gun. Release quickly, and you’d fire. Gently back off the button, and you’d lower your weapon. This wasn’t mere novelty. It was an important part of holding up guards and <em>not</em> shooting them if you didn’t want to. </p><p>That’s true to the vision, I’d argue, that Kojima had for these games as well. Aiming a weapon was a deliberate action with a chance of failure tied to a kinesthetic function of your hands and fingers that was prone to error, slip-ups—risk. It made the guns feel more present. More dangerous.</p><p>Leaning and peeking around corners was also influenced by pressure sensitivity on the shoulder buttons. Squeeze gently, and you’d ever so slightly peek around a corner or above something you were crouching behind. Push it all the way down, and you’d lean out far enough to aim your gun—and should you decide firing off a shot wasn’t worth the risk, you could use the pressure sensitivity to lower the weapon and get back into cover. </p><p>These were qualifiers at the end of a command you’d issue in the OG the games, not an additional command as it is in rereleases, where lowering your weapon requires a second, different button press, and having a range of motion in leaning and peeking just seems to be gone, as far as I can tell.</p><p>Let me be clear, too, as the lady with a bunch of analog synths and a healthy distrust of digital guitar amplifiers (though I use them all the time). I don’t think the pressure-sensitive buttons were valuable just because of that cultural signifier of quality and “realness” that analog freaks like myself typically get wrapped in. Pressure sensitivity also wasn’t precise on the PS2 and PS3. It was not about precision or the quality of analog, it was about a different kinesthetic operating in a game; that the PS2 and PS3 could capture and make use of a different range of motion and thought process than just pressing an on/off button. <em>How</em> you pressed that button mattered, and devs like Hideo Kojima saw that as an opportunity to diversify the sandbox of his games. </p><p>True, modern triggers on contemporary gamepads, the touchpad on the DualSense, and motion controls can all translate a range of motion in a game. Triggers, in fact, offer a kind of pressure sensitivity, but their position on the controller occupies a different kinesthetic force: pulling, instead of pushing.<br></p><p>And that inability to use that force of pressure makes replays of <em>MGS3 </em>and <em>MGS2</em> register as a fundamentally different experience to me. My brain continues to expect a level of interactivity that doesn’t exist anymore. It’s like being asked to play a racing game without analog sticks. Pressure sensitivity may never have been very accurate, and probably prone to malfunction over time, but it represents a very real loss in how classic games <em>felt</em>, how they manifested in the real world, what they demanded of our bodies. It was subtle, perhaps even invisible to many. Pressure sensitivity may have vanished from our controllers now for over a decade, but its absence is one of the loudest for me.</p><p>.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://kotaku.com/metal-gear-solid-ps2-ps3-analog-pressure-sensitive-1851786575]]></content:encoded>
