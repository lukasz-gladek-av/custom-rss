              <p>When Valve released the Steam Deck, it reset expectations for what portable PC gaming could look like. I mean, they did just copy Nintendo’s homework with the Switch design, but that misses the bigger point. The Steam Deck didn’t ask players to rebuild their libraries or buy special versions of games. Gamers can take their existing Steam collections on the road. That single decision helped create an entirely new class of hardware: handheld gaming PCs. Sure, we’ve always had gaming laptops, but the appeal of being able to easily pick-up and play on a dedicated piece of gaming hardware is undeniable.</p>
<p>As impressive as the Steam Deck is in handheld form, its screen can feel limiting in certain situations. A 7.4-inch display works great on a commute or during travel, but it doesn’t always suit relaxed couch gaming. Sometimes you want to stretch out and play on a large television, the same way consoles have done for years. Thanks to docking solutions, the Steam Deck can handle that role with ease. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6915/">One suitable option comes from Anker, and it’s currently discounted by 10%.</a> The dock usually sells for $33, but a $3 price cut brings it down to a clean $30 for a short time. Sure, it’s not the greatest discount ever, but $30 for a Steam Deck docking station is an absolutely fair value.</p>

<h2>See Every Detail</h2>
<p>Once connected, the Steam Deck can output to an external display at up to 4K resolution and 60Hz over its HDMI port, a major step up from its native 1280 × 800 handheld resolution. That extra clarity makes a noticeable difference on large TVs and monitors. The dock also works with other devices, including other handheld PCs like the ASUS ROG Ally, Lenovo Legion Go, and even tablets such as the iPad.</p>
<p>The dock supports up to 100W USB-C Power Delivery, keeping the Steam Deck charged while it’s connected to a display. Then when you’re ready to take it on the road, it’ll be at full charge.</p>



<p>It comes with a few built-in USB-A and USB-C ports which allow for wired controllers, keyboards, or other accessories. An integrated Ethernet port supports speeds up to 1,000Mbps, offering a more stable connection for online games and faster downloads compared to Wi-Fi.</p>
<p>The compact design makes the dock easy to pack, great for traveling. You can play handheld on the way to your destination, then dock it to a hotel or Airbnb TV later. The open-face design also allows tabletop use, letting the screen sit at a comfortable angle while you play with a controller, no TV required.</p>
