              <p><span>I’ve put maybe five or six hours into </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-legends-za-review-switch-2-bugs-performance-2000637719"><i><span>Pokémon Legends: Z-A</span></i><span>’s</span></a> <a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-legends-z-a-mega-raichu-evolution-x-y-paid-dlc-2000625371"><i><span>Mega Dimension </span></i><span>DLC</span></a><span>, and I spent maybe two of those hours desperately searching for two items: Raichunite X and Raichunite Y. These two Mega Stones would allow Raichu, my favorite Pokémon who has</span><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-raichu-alolan-pikachu-anime-1851011570"><span> never gotten any respect</span></a><span>, to Mega Evolve into one of two forms. I had been begging Game Freak for Mega Raichu for so long, I had honestly given up hope that my boy would get a superpowered transformation in </span><i><span>Legends: Z-A</span></i><span>, then they gave him two. I like them both, but I gravitated toward the X form pre-launch, and now that I’ve seen the guy in-game, I’m feeling very vindicated, because my guy is flying around like Superman.</span></p> <p><span>Raichu never got a Mega form when the mechanic was introduced in </span><i><span>Pokémon X </span></i><span>and </span><i><span>Y</span></i><span>, which was just one of the many examples of Game Freak and The Pokémon Company giving my boy the shaft in favor of Pikachu, his much more popular pre-evolution. Pikachu got the Gigantamax kaiju-style transformation in </span><i><span>Sword </span></i><span>and </span><i><span>Shield</span></i><span>, as well as exclusive Z-Moves in </span><i><span>Sun </span></i><span>and </span><i><span>Moon</span></i><span>. The only time Raichu’s ever gotten any “love” is when Game Freak turned him into something else entirely by giving him a floating psychic version in the Alola region, and that </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-legends-za-alolan-raichu-quest-how-to-get-mega-2000637259"><span>imposter won’t stop following me around</span></a><span> in every game. Now, however, the OG can float around, too, thanks to Mega Evolution.</span></p>

 <p><span>According to the Pokédex, Mega Raichu X is able to float like this because of the electromagnetic repulsion from his two tails. Before we saw him in-game, I imagined this would manifest in Raichu floating with a vertical stance, almost as if he were ascending with his tails pointed toward the ground. This would’ve probably looked silly, but I liked the design enough to let it go. What I wasn’t prepared for was to see that my super-powered mouse friend pulls a Clark Kent and flies with an arm extended like he’s got a city to save. Y’all, I am obsessed.</span></p>

 <figure id="attachment_2000652249" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000652249"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000652249"><strong>“Cause I’m a punk rocker, yes I am.”</strong> © The Pokémon Company / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p><span>It’s a fun stylistic choice, but it actually has some pretty important perks in battle, too. Mega Raichu X can fly up to attack targets in the air, letting him knock Mega Shards off the sides of tall buildings and use physical attacks on flying enemies. This is kind of his whole deal. Mega Raichu X is the physical attacker, while the Y form is focused on special attacks. Now that he can fly, no one is out of range of a punch from his chonky paws. Neither Mega Raichu gets a type change after transforming, so while Mega Raichu X doesn’t become an Electric/Flying-type, I’m fairly certain he will gain the Levitate passive ability that makes him immune to Ground-type attacks, though we won’t know until a future game, as </span><i><span>Legends: Z-A </span></i><span>doesn’t include abilities. If that happens, Mega Raichu X will be one of the few Pokémon without any weaknesses, as Electric’s only weakness is Ground. That would be such a cool perk, and might make this transformation a force to be reckoned with in competitive play in </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-champions-legends-z-a-presents-day-stream-1851766818"><i><span>Pokémon Champions</span></i></a><span> next year.</span></p> <p><span>Both Mega Raichus have gotten some flak for looking too similar to Pikachu, with X having its pre-evolution’s color scheme and Y maintaining its body shape, but I couldn’t be happier with these two. I like seeing the </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-legends-z-a-mega-raichu-x-y-gorochu-scrapped-2000652133"><span>entirety of a Pokémon’s lineage show up</span></a><span> in its Mega form, and Mega Raichu X’s flight-based movement is a really endearing new page to add to that history. I hope this form shows up in the anime soon so we can have sick clips of Mega Raichu X flying around and whooping ass. Until then, I’ll be using mine to save the citizens of </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-legends-za-lumiose-city-ending-zohran-mamdani-2000641431"><span>Lumiose City</span></a><span>. It’s a Pidgey…it’s a Latias…no, it’s Mega Raichu X!</span></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><span>It’s 2012. Barack Obama is president. Gamers are melting down over the ending of </span><i><span>Mass Effect 3</span></i><span>. Harvey Smith and Raphael Colantonio, then at </span><i><span>Dishonored</span></i><span> developer Arkane Studios, are flying on a Bethesda-chartered private jet to Los Angeles for the Spike Video Game Awards, hosted by Samuel L. Jackson and held at Sony Pictures Studios.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><i><span>Dishonored</span></i><span> is up for several awards, including Game of the Year (it loses to Telltale’s</span><i><span> The Walking Dead</span></i><span>), Best Xbox 360 Game (it loses to </span><i><span>Halo 4</span></i><span>), Best PS3 Game (it loses to </span><i><span>Journey</span></i><span>), and Best Action-Adventure Game (it wins). Jessica Alba presents Smith and Colantonio with their trophy.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><span>“Man, when you get it good, and when someone says, ‘Here’s a bonus, and by the way, we’re going to take you to The Game Awards,’ you cry. Literally. We literally cried,” Smith told me over a video call.</span></p> <p><span>Things are a little different 13 years later. Donald Trump is president. Gamers are melting down over whether or not Lara Croft is hot enough for them. Arkane Austin doesn’t exist anymore (though both Smith and Colantonio are still working on games). And the Game Awards streams online as cable TV is </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/netflix-warner-paramount-trump-bidding-war-2000651372"><span>dismantled and sold for parts</span></a><span>. The only constant is the man who worked on both shows: Geoff Keighley.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><span>But the video game industry in which he operates has changed dramatically. Back-to-back years of layoffs and studio closures, market consolidation, and a race to embrace generative AI have left many developers dazed, confused, and unemployed. </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/video-game-launch-paris-hilton-lindsay-lohan-xbox-ps3-1851231204"><span>Video game launches don’t have as much fanfare as they did in the aughts</span></a><span>—there are no appearances from Paris Hilton or Lindsay Lohan. And the Game Awards, while still boasting some Hollywood talent, isn’t as star-studded as the defunct Spike ceremony.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <h2><b>Organizing gaming’s Oscars</b></h2> <p><span>There’s a lot of behind-the-scenes organizing for awards ceremonies that doesn’t get as much attention. The teams that work on putting together these events are vast, and often involve multiple companies that aren’t directly tied to the industry being honored that night (they might be production companies, security firms, contractors, and seasonal staff). The Peacock Theater, where The Game Awards is held, seats up to 7,100, and Keighley and company have to decide how they all get divvied up.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><span>The cost of putting on an awards show broadcast on cable TV is offset somewhat by the ad sales from the commercials that air during breaks, but the Game Awards are only available on streaming platforms (no commercials), so Keighley sells coveted spots for reveals, trailers, and previews, as well as </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/summer-game-fest-sgf-prices-trailer-cost-e3-keighley-1851523472"><span>sponsorships for specific awards</span></a><span>. While some slots are reserved for the biggest surprises and Keighley curates free slots for what he personally wants to champion, others have to pay to get in front of the </span><a href="https://variety.com/2024/tv/news/game-awards-2024-viewership-record-1236253334/"><span>millions of eyeballs watching from home</span></a><span>.</span></p>

 <p><span>And the prices keep going up. According to two sources familiar with this year’s show, a 60-second trailer during the 2025 ceremony can cost up to $450,000. A three-minute trailer costs over $1 million. Two separate sources in the video game publishing world said that while they had not been briefed on this year’s rates, these sounded in line with what they’d expect from previous years.</span></p>

 <p><span>But what about attendance? Tom Cruise gets to go to the Oscars, but he may only be allowed a single guest, and most of the people behind the latest </span><i><span>Mission: Impossible</span></i><span> flick likely won’t get an invite. You don’t see the gaffer from </span><i><span>Challengers</span></i><span> sitting at the table next to Zendaya, and Keighley clearly wants to evoke Hollywood-style allure for his annual ceremony (why else would Al Pacino be invited?).&nbsp;</span></p>  <p><span>However, the video game industry isn’t Hollywood, despite its best efforts. It’s not financially viable to invite 100-plus-person studios to attend the Game Awards for free, but do you know of a single awards show that offers for-sale tickets to its potential honorees, tickets which are pulled from the same pool as those sold to the general public (i.e., fans)? The Game Awards does.</span></p> <p><span>According to multiple developers from both smaller indie studios and AAA monoliths who wished to remain anonymous, the Game Awards only offers two tickets to attend the ceremony to studios that get nominated, though there was at least one instance in which a developer received more than that, and some overall confusion about which studios get preferential treatment (aka more than the two generally allotted). The Game Awards’ organizers did not respond to a request for comment.</span></p>

 <p><span>A source told <i>Kotaku</i> that Sandfall Interactive, the studio behind this year’s </span><i><span>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</span></i><span>, bought a swath of tickets at face value (around $300 each) to ensure more of the team could attend. </span><i><span>Expedition 33</span></i><span> recently set a record for the most nominations in Game Awards history with 12, so the desire to send as many people to the ceremony as possible makes sense. Sandfall did not respond to a request for comment.</span></p> <p><span>&nbsp;</span><span>But not every studio has the means or the desire to send a large crew of developers to the ceremony—whether it’s due to ticket pricing, the cost of travel, or other factors.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><span>One developer who worked on a game nominated for Best Accessibility at the 2024 Game Awards told me that their studio had to “buy the rest” of the tickets, as there were “only two up front for our nomination.” The two team members who were given the free tickets through the Game Awards sat in one area, while the larger group was scattered throughout the Peacock Theater. The source said that the tickets the studio purchased for the developers appeared to be full price.</span></p> <p><span>“I was told that the team was offered two tickets as nominees (these tickets come with access to the red carpet and green room experiences), and then provided a link to a page where additional tickets could be purchased,” a lead designer nominated last year who wished to remain anonymous told me. “As far as I could tell, the page was just the publicly available ticket page, and there were no discounts or special access to ticket allotments (i.e., particular seats in the theater) available.”</span></p> <p><span>Because of this, the game director purchased their own ticket from the public-facing ticket pool for around $700. “I didn’t want to miss a likely once-in-a-lifetime experience of being there in person for a nominated game that I’d had a major hand in, so I paid.” The Game Awards did not respond to a request for comment.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <h2><b>Seat fillers and superfans</b></h2> <p><span>While restricted availability for nominees can be chalked up to limited space and funds, things get complicated when you open up attendance to an industry’s award show to the general public. Matan Even, the 2022 stage crasher, </span><a href="https://www.polygon.com/23502321/game-awards-bill-clinton-rabbi-kid-matan-even-hong-kong/"><span>told </span><i><span>Polygon</span></i></a><span> he bought a ticket to the ceremony during the general sale and “simply walked up from his seat in the audience alongside the award winners.”</span></p> <p><span>This year, tickets were released on October 30, while </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/game-awards-2025-goty-nominees-categories-clair-obscur-2000644825"><span>nominees were revealed on November 17</span></a><span>. “Don’t watch the surprises—be in the room,” The Game Awards official announcement for ticket sales read.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>By November 7, I was told by the Game Awards’ organizers that there were already no more free tickets available for press (I received one last year as a freelancer and the year before through my work at </span><i><span>Kotaku</span></i><span>). On that day, </span><a href="https://bsky.app/profile/alyssamerc.bsky.social/post/3m52o6tzmb22b"><span>the Game Awards tickets ranged in price</span></a><span> from $58.92 for upper mezzanine seats to over $1,000 for resale tickets in the back of center orchestra (most of the high-profile attendees sit in the front of this section). Last week,&nbsp; there were three tickets available in the center orchestra for $997 each (resale), and a smattering of tickets surrounding that section, ranging in price from $500-$800. Upper and lower mezzanine seats, also sporadically available, were going for between $300 and $545.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>A freelance narrative writer who worked on a game nominated this year expressed frustration about the Game Awards’ ticketing process. Because they are no longer under contract with the nominated studio, they weren’t invited through the typical email from the Game Awards’ organizers, but still wanted to attend the event to celebrate their work.&nbsp;</span></p>

  <p><span>“Even if I had wanted to pay the inflated prices for scalper tickets, I couldn’t find 2 seats together,” they told me, with said tickets, according to them, running between $600-$1000. “At the very least, TGA should wait to sell general release tickets until after the nominations are announced…or have a separate bucket of tickets for devs who can provide proof that they worked on a nominated game.”</span></p> <p><span>Instead of buying tickets that cost more than some people’s monthly rent, the dev signed up for the seat filler program, which is organized by Gotham Casting. It’s unclear how many free tickets are set aside this way, but they wondered if the Game Awards prioritizes giving fans tickets over industry members because “the fans will scream and cheer for the trailers and the devs won’t.”</span></p>

 <p><span>The Eventbrite listing for seat fillers is directed at “ALL GAMERS and Video Game Fans &amp; Enthusiasts!” and promises “huge special performances to be announced” and instructions for what to expect on the day of the event. Seat fillers have to arrive two hours before the show starts and are instructed on how to dress (“men: upscale casual attire/button down shirts ok,” “women: cocktail dresses/upscale outfits”) and told not to wear cosplay, ripped jeans, or sneakers (unlike host Geoff Keighley).&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>“As a seatfiller, there will be an opportunity that you will be on camera,” the description reads. </span><span>“Seat fillers will begin their night seated in the holding area in the theater. As PAID TICKET HOLDERS ARRIVE, we move seat fillers as needed.” Seat fillers are also reminded that “guests have paid upwards of HUNDREDS a ticket for their seats!” and to make sure they “enjoy show [sic] &amp; have fun!” Gotham Casting did not reply to a request for comment.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <h2><b>Gaming’s biggest night</b></h2> <p><span>Keighley clearly wants the Game Awards to be big and bold and shiny—the best annual celebration of video games that monolithic studio money and Old Spice deodorant can buy. But there is a clear, consistent tension between putting on a show that honors the people working on video games and one that keeps the millions of fans watching in the hopes of seeing a trailer for </span><i><span>The</span></i> <i><span>Elder Scrolls 6</span></i><span>.</span></p> <p><span>“It’s a balancing act,” Keighley told</span> <a href="https://www.thegamebusiness.com/p/interview-geoff-keighley-on-the-impossible"><i><span>The Game Business</span></i></a> <span>in a recent interview. “There’s the awards aspect of the show, there’s the announcement aspect, and yes, there are some people that would like to see the show be all awards. Some would like to see all announcements.”</span></p> <p><span>No one feels the wobble of that balancing act more than the developers, especially the ones who aren’t studio executives or creative directors and who struggle to even get tickets to the Game Awards every year.</span></p> <p><span>Despite the pricey trailer slots and expensive ticketing problem, many industry members recognize how important the Game Awards are to those who have spent their careers working on games. Smith and Colantonio spoke at length about how life-changing attending the then-Spike Video Game Awards was.</span></p>

 <p><span>“It’s career-changing, the market opens up to you in a way,” Smith said. “If you work in games for decades, you’ve probably gotten your teeth knocked out a few times. I’ve worked on games that got 60 percent ratings, I’ve worked on games that got laughed at, I’ve worked on games that got me fired, I’ve worked on games where the studio was shut down…Then I worked with Ralph, and we made several pitches that got killed, and we almost went under. Then we made </span><i><span>Dishonored</span></i><span>.”</span></p>  <p><span>“It was easy for us to enjoy it, because there was Bethesda behind us, so we did not have to worry about paying for flights, what to organize, when to be there,” Colantonio said, referencing the 2010 acquisition of Arkane by Bethesda’s parent company, ZeniMax. “If Arkane in 2005, when we shipped </span><i><span>Dark Messiah,</span></i><span> had been nominated, it would have been just me there, period. It’s expensive, and it would have felt like a sacrifice.”</span></p> <p><span>Smith, well-versed in Arkane’s humble beginnings (the studio was started in 1999 by Colantonio and just four other men), recognized the struggle indie studios face when attending gaming’s biggest night. “If you’re a tiny French studio like Sandfall [the team behind </span><i><span>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</span></i><span>], the pay difference [between countries] means getting to LA, flying from Europe, staying in a hotel, eating there, all of that is way more expensive,” he said.</span></p> <p><span>For some, </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/game-awards-keighley-e3-trailers-1851083267"><span>the Game Awards has felt more like an E3 presentation</span></a><span> where everyone wears suits (finally) than a proper ceremony honoring the people who made the year’s best games. Yet for those making games, especially at smaller studios, the importance of a Game Awards nomination cannot be overstated—a big win at the annual event could reinvigorate a struggling studio, or guarantee a second game gets greenlit.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><span>Some think we should all just ignore the Game Awards and their hyper-promotional approach, and instead direct our attention to more celebratory affairs, such as the BAFTA Game Awards and the Game Developers’ Choice Awards, where the focus is more squarely on honoring the previous year’s games rather than on promoting games yet to come.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>“</span><span>Tickets for [the BAFTAs] are also paid (and include dinner), but the entire vibe of the event and the apparent reverence it holds for the nominated games and their creators was so much of a better experience,” the aforementioned lead designer nominated last year said. “It was an extremely stark contrast.”</span></p> <p><span>The Game Awards, like the video game industry itself, represent the chasm between the studios that develop games and can shell out for a million-dollar ad slot during gaming’s biggest night without hesitation, and the people who work on them, who struggle to afford a ticket to the ceremony meant to honor their work.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><em>Additional reporting by Ethan Gach.</em></p>

              <p>The latest batch of games joining Sony’s PS Plus subscription library in December 2025 has been revealed and it’s not a bad haul. In fact, it has one of the more overlooked JRPGs of the last few years on it: <a href="https://kotaku.com/granblue-fantasy-relink-review-pc-1851209297"><em>Granblue Fantasy: Relink</em></a><em>.&nbsp;</em></p> <p>The Cygames-developed spin-off to the popular mobile franchise is part linear anime RPG, part <em>Monster Hunter</em>, and includes some excellent real-time combat thanks to the pedigree of the Platinum Games employees who helped make it. It combines the pacing and strategizing of an MMO boss battle with the responsiveness and ability juggling of a great action game. Plus, it’s multiplayer and includes an extensive end game. All told, it was one of last year’s bigger surprises for me and one I still feel like a lot of people haven’t woken up to.</p>

 <p>Here’s the rest of <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/12/10/playstation-plus-game-catalog-for-december-assassins-creed-mirage-wo-long-fallen-dynasty-skate-story-and-more/">what’s coming this month</a>:</p> <h2>PlayStation Plus Extra And Premium</h2> <ul> <li><em>Assassin’s Creed Mirage</em> | PS5, PS4</li> <li><em>Wo Long: Fallen Dynasty</em> | PS5, PS4</li> <li><em>Skate Story</em> | PS5</li> <li><em>Granblue Fantasy: Relink</em> | PS5, PS4</li> <li><em>Planet Coaster 2</em> | PS5</li> <li><em>Cat Quest III</em> | PS5, PS4</li> <li><em>Lego Horizon Adventures</em> | PS5</li> <li><em>Paw Patrol: Grand Prix</em> | PS5, PS4<strong><br> </strong></li> <li><em>Paw Patrol World</em> | PS5, PS4</li> </ul> <h2><strong>PlayStation Classics (Premium Only)</strong></h2> <ul> <li><em>Soulcalibur III</em> | PS5, PS4</li> </ul> <p><em>Granblue Fantasy: Relink</em> aside, the main headliners are <a href="https://kotaku.com/assassin-s-creed-mirage-review-ps5-steam-pc-valhalla-1850897175"><em>Assassin’s Creed Mirage</em></a> and <a href="https://kotaku.com/wo-long-fallen-dynasty-review-ps5-soulslike-nioh-sekiro-1850176726"><em>Wo Long: Fallen Dynasty</em></a><em>.</em> Despite launching in 2023, the former recently got a free update that added new story content and additional parkour options, including a dedicated jump. The latter, also from that year, is a Three Kingdoms-based Soulslike from Team Ninja that’s not quite <em>Nioh 2-</em>quality but is still pretty great.</p> <p>Everything above, with the exception of <em>Skate Story</em> which arrived on December 8, joins PS Plus on December 16. That includes<em> Soulcalibur III</em>, arguably the best entry in the fighting game series. It was also the first to let players create their own characters with the Create-A-Soul mode.</p>

              <p>I love this time of year. Cozy weather. Tasty cookies and warm cocoa. <a href="https://kotaku.com/anthem-still-hasnt-taken-down-its-christmas-decorations-1841522397">Festive events in games</a>. And of course, all the <a href="https://kotaku.com/mcdonalds-ai-christmas-ad-deleted-comments-removed-bad-2000651791">Christmas</a> lights hanging on houses, businesses, and elsewhere. In particular, I have a soft spot for all the colorful lights that get hung up during December. They just look so magical at night and fill me with nostalgic feelings. What can I say? I’m a sucker for plastic lights.</p> <p>So when I randomly discovered <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3419910/Light_Up_The_Town/"><em>Light Up the Town</em></a>, a newly released cozy indie game all about decorating a wintry small town with Christmas lights, I immediately installed it and happily discovered a wonderful holiday treat that I can’t stop playing.</p>

  <p><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3419910/Light_Up_The_Town/">Out now on Steam, <em>Light Up the Town</em></a> has a super simple premise. You play as a young anthropomorphized ferret named Bean who is going through some stuff. His father, in an effort to lift his spirits, asks Bean to follow in his own footsteps and handle lighting up the entire small Colorado town of Bellflower. If he does this, he’ll get a new bike for Christmas. There’s more going on, but I’ll leave that for you to discover on your own. The narrative isn’t bad at all, but it’s not why you should play <em>Light Up the Town</em>. The real reason is that decorating this snow-covered town with various Christmas lights and decorations is sublime.</p>

 <p>In real life, putting up lights across multiple buildings, roofs, and interiors can be a hassle of tangled cables, extension cords, and broken bulbs. <em>Light Up the Town</em> doesn’t include any of that. Instead, you are able to fling strings of lights in different colors and shapes across large distances like a Christmas Jedi. You can also undo your actions and cut light strings whenever you want, letting you create massively long or incredibly short strings of light. Also, don’t worry about plugs or running cords. Lights just work, regardless of where you put them. Is this realistic? Nope! And I love it. It’s all the joy of hanging lights up and making a home glow without the hassle or headaches the process can create in the real world.</p>

I recommend playing in first-person mode, but regardless of what view you pick, the end result of putting up all these lights is always magical. The lighting in this game is phenomenal and changes based on how you decorate. Cover a house in just a few white lights? The glow will be softer and dimmer. Fill a room with 20 strings of red and green lights? You’ll create a vibrant Christmas rave. As you hang up lights, look for coins to collect. These can be spent at stores to unlock more varieties of lights and new decoration items.</p> <p>Each time I stepped back after putting up lights for an hour or so, I’d find myself lingering the same way I do in real life when spotting Christmas lights at night. <em>Light Up the Town</em> truly nails the festive and cozy vibes of a cold, dark night in December filled with thousands of tiny bright lights in the snow. For fans of the holiday season, put on your favorite festive songs, make a hot beverage, grab a blanket, and then dive into <em>Light Up the Town.</em>&nbsp;Just set a timer so you don’t spend your whole night decorating.</p>
