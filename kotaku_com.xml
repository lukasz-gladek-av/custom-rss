The publisher was believed to be Square Enix, and fans speculated that the project in question was a sequel to <em>Outriders</em>, a surprisingly good 2021 loot shooter. According to new reporting, Gemini was indeed<em> Outriders 2</em> and the recording of motion capture for the game’s sci-fi story was underway when it was canned. </p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="195519" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="I Didn’t Play Final Fantasy XVI ‘Right,’ And That’s OK" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="148" data-playlist="195519,196452,195905" data-current="195519"><div><p>I Didn’t Play Final Fantasy XVI ‘Right,’ And That’s OK</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195519/195519_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195519/195519_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195519/195519_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195519/195519_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/21013.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>News first came by way of <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://thethumbwars.com/outriders-2-revealed-to-be-one-of-people-can-flys-two-canceled-games-exclusive/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://thethumbwars.com/outriders-2-revealed-to-be-one-of-people-can-flys-two-canceled-games-exclusive/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>TheThumbWars</em></a></span> which reported that the sequel was “nearly finished” before it was put on ice over disputes with Square Enix.

According to <em>TheThumbWars</em>, the project’s developers didn’t really know about the publisher’s issues until it was being shelved. </p><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/outriders-the-kotaku-review-1846651042&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/outriders-the-kotaku-review-1846651042">The first <em>Outriders</em></a></span><em> </em>was a grim shooter about settlers on an alien planet who develop mysterious mutations and go to war with one another. It was a bit like <em>Borderlands</em> through the lens of <em>Heart of Darkness</em>, with third-person combat that revolved around gear drops and magic powers. It had the whiff of a live-service grind which repelled some players at launch and left others feeling like its endgame was a bit light on repayable content, but it offered a decent multiplayer story campaign elevated by some of the most fun I’ve had with third-person shooting in a long time. </p><p>It was the type of AA-going-on-AAA franchise that deserved a second shot to see how it could grow and where the developers might take the formula next, especially if it was free of having to disguise itself as a live-service shooter to convince a publisher to greenlight it in the heyday of <em>Destiny 2</em>. It’s unclear if there’s still an outside chance <em>Outriders 2</em> could eventually see the light of day under a new publisher, but that seems unlikely. Square Enix is currently in the midst of a three-year plan to double down on its biggest franchises and pull back from riskier outside bets.

I just wish one of them was<em> Outriders 2</em>. </p><p>.</p></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://kotaku.com/outriders-2-canceled-loot-shooter-people-can-fly-1851785469]]></content:encoded>
