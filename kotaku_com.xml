That’s a shame because the bones of this tactical RPG are some of the strongest around, even if the surrounding fluff can get in the way sometimes.</p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="196055" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="6 Things To Know Before Starting Persona 5 Tactica" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="227" data-playlist="196055,196086,196599" data-current="196055"><div><p>6 Things To Know Before Starting Persona 5 Tactica</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196055/196055_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196055/196055_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196055/196055_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196055/196055_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/21584.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>A sequel to Image &amp; Form’s 2015 3DS game, <em>SteamWorld Heist II</em> trades its predecessor’s sci-fi setting for a <em>Pirates of the Caribbean</em>-infused take on the high seas, but otherwise the bulk of it still revolves around turn-based encounters in side-scrolling 2D maps where gunshots ricochet and grenades blow up cover to create memorably chaotic fights.</p><p>You’re still looting procedurally generated levels and trying to escape as bullets and lasers go whizzing past your crew’s mechanical heads, but there’s a major difference in <em>SteamWorld Heist II</em>. Unlike the first game, in which characters were each ingrained with specific class archetypes, the sequel lets you give any crew member any weapon and then start building their kit around that. Equip a sniper rifle and you become a sharpshooter that specializes in dealing critical damage from afar. Wield a hammer and you become a brawler who gets extra turns and other bonuses from smashing foes up close. </p><p>This offers a lot of flexibility and freedom, but <em>SteamWorld Heist II </em>goes a step further and lets characters mix and match skills from different classes once they’ve unlocked them, rewarding experimentation and incentivizing a hunt for synergies that will break the game and help you take no prisoners when breaking into high security bases in search of powerful treasure. It’s basically the inverse of the<em> Final Fantasy Tactics </em>job system where skill trees were linked to classes rather than weapons. The result is a refreshing change-up that’s more streamlined without ditching too much depth. </p><p>I finished the game last summer on Switch (it’s also on PlayStation, Xbox, and PC) and loved every minute in which I found myself analyzing bullet trajectories, blast radiuses, and the odds of success if I sacrificed one character to cover the rest of the crew’s tactical retreat. Even through procedurally generated maps where any lollygagging will quickly find you overrun by enemy forces, <em>SteamWorld Heist II</em>’s ingredients form an excellent recipe for tense moments, analytical showdowns, and seat-of-your-pants escapes. It cleverly iterates on the best elements of the first game and makes them even more robust and fun. </p><p>The only downside to <em>SteamWorld Heist II</em> is that it lacks the first game’s concise 12-hour runtime. It’s almost twice as long, with the extra hours going toward some late-game grinding and a new overworld exploration system in which you explore as a submarine gunning down enemy ships in real-time in exchange for small rewards that quickly stop being worth the trouble. Like the rest of <em>SteamWorld Heist II</em>, the shoot-‘em-up sections are smartly designed and control well but ultimately feel like unnecessary time wasters and frustrating distractions from the excellent 2D tactical combat at the game’s core. </p><p>Ultimately, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://humblebundleinc.sjv.io/c/379647/2059850/25796?subId1=KT-&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.humblebundle.com%2Fstore%2Fsteamworld-heist-ii%3Fhmb_source%3Dsearch_bar&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://humblebundleinc.sjv.io/c/379647/2059850/25796?subId1=KT-&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.humblebundle.com%2Fstore%2Fsteamworld-heist-ii%3Fhmb_source%3Dsearch_bar" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>SteamWorld Heist II</em></a></span><em> </em>is like a peanut butter and jelly sandwich with an extra piece of bread in the middle. Still delicious but eventually way more than you want to eat. I still ended up finishing the game because the 2D <em>XCOM</em>-like shootouts are good enough to make wading through all the filler worth it. <em>SteamWorld Heist II </em>is a great tactics RPG that genre acolytes will be doing themselves a disservice to overlook.</p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>Stern Pinball is back with another new machine and this time it’s a tribute to <em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons</em> following the tabletop RPG’s 50th anniversary. The table comes with all kinds of whimsical bells and whistles and an all-star voice cast, and it can be yours starting at $7,000. Or you could pay nearly double that for the limited edition version.</p><p><em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons: The Tyrant’s Eye</em> takes players into the Forgotten Realms to face off against owlbears, gelatinous cubes, a red dragon, and Xanathar the beholder, all with just a pair of flippers and a few steel balls. Trap doors unlock new dungeons and dice rolls will dictate how the adventure unfolds. I don’t have a spare down payment for a new car lying around, but I do have a basement just waiting to be renovated where this would fit perfectly. </p><p>  “Battle Rath the Relentless, the red dragon, the most advanced animatronic mech in pinball, [who] intelligently reacts to player action with multi-axis motion and features omnidirectional impact sensing technology,” writes Stern in a press release. “Voiced by the iconic Michael Dorn, players will attempt to defeat Rath the Relentless with pinballs and by hitting the 3-bank target, steal its treasure. When Rath the Relentless breathes his magnificent fire, multiple pinballs shoot from its mouth but be prepared. Players can activate a metal shield between the flippers to not only defend against attacks but also assist with playfield shots.”</p><p>I’m by no means a pinball connoisseur, but that all sounds rad. Critical Role fans are also in for a treat since Matthew Mercer, Laura Bailey, and Marisha Ray are also part of the <em>D&amp;D </em>pinball machine’s voice cast, along with Kevin Smith, Luke Gygax, Chris Prynoski, Brendon Small, and Gerard Way. And the table even incorporates the Stern Insider app to save progress. It’s effectively a <em>D&amp;D</em> pinball roguelike. In fact, that would be a great idea for an actual video game too. </p></div></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
