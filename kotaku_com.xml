It’s also not clear if the plan is to recreate the entire map of <em>Bloodborne</em> or just a smaller combat arena that shows off the concept in a more limited form. It certainly sounds more like the latter. </p><p>One thing Foulquier will definitely want to look into doing is changing the name. Another <em>Bloodborne</em> fan project called <em>Bloodborne Kart</em> came to Steam last year but was forced by Sony, which published <em>Bloodborne</em>, to remove the name from its title.

Maybe it can just be called <em>Hunter Arena</em>. </p><p>While <em>Dark Souls</em>, <em>Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice</em>, and <em>Elden Ring</em> are all widely-acclaimed and very popular, <em>Bloodborne</em> fans are built different and the game retains a special place in PlayStation players’ imagination. It’s never been ported to PC (officially, at least) or even PS5, and it doesn’t sound like a remaster, remake, or sequel is anywhere in the current pipeline at FromSoftware. At least projects like <em>Bloodborne Top Down Arena </em>are continuing to keep the hype alive in the meantime. </p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

But we’re not gonna delve into anything that actually happens in the game here. So don’t worry about that. But there are pages of concept art for hypothetical party members that didn’t end up in <em>The Veilguard</em>. Some of them would have been new characters that don’t have names, such as a qunari mage dressed in chains and tattoo-covered Antivan Crow. But there is one character in the book who would have been a returning character from 2014’s <em>Dragon Age: Inquisition</em>. However, she wasn’t an ally. In fact, you could kill her in your playthrough depending on your choices. This was magister Calpernia, who once led the Venatori mages against the player in one of <em>Inquisition</em>’s routes.</p><p>According to the art book, Calpernia was a potential party member at some point in <em>The Veilguard</em>’s development. She’s shown in the concept art in some regal armor, notably with a prosthetic leg. Neve, one of the party members who made it into the game, is a mage with a prosthetic leg, so it seems like some of those concepts may have been adapted for that character.</p><p>Logistically, it makes sense that BioWare would scrap this idea because Calpernia exists in so many different quantum states depending on player choice. But that hasn’t stopped fans from being upset about an underrated fan-favorite villain not making it into <em>The Veilguard</em>.</p><p>Personally, I have little attachment to Calpernia because I never encountered her in my <em>Inquisition</em> playthrough. The only way to get her to show up is by recruiting the templars in the game’s first act, and I’m a career mage who was trying to smooch Dorian. So Calpernia and I never crossed paths. But it’s always fun to know who might’ve joined the party sometime down the line. I mean, unless it upsets you to know this information. But Calpernia could still show up in a future <em>Dragon Age </em>game, assuming BioWare allows players to import choices on what happened to her.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

In the video, it was finally officially revealed that Benson was behind the voice of Solid Snake’s spy accomplice Eva, confirming a long-running fan theory. </p><p>So why did Benson not include her name in the<em> MGS3</em>'s credits? Well, according to her it was due to her other, more family-friendly projects. <br></p><p>“So, when we recorded, [David Hayet] and I were in the studio together back in 2003,” said Benson. “Just, the various projects that I am affiliated with in my career are sort of family-based, children-based, things like that. So, it was actually Kris Zimmerman Salter, that was our [voice] director, that she kind of sat down with me and she’s like, ‘Maybe we need to change your name.’” </p><p>Salter allegedly asked Benson what her dog’s name was when she was growing up. <em>The Little Mermaid </em>voice actress explained it was “Suzette Monet” which is a pretty wild name for a childhood pet. Anyway, the director modified the name to create Suzetta Minet and that was what was included in the game’s credits.</p><p>After the game launched, some fans started to theorize that Eva was voiced by Jodi Benson based on how similar the <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/mgs3-delta-snake-eater-remake-ps5-screenshots-new-1851632108&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/mgs3-delta-snake-eater-remake-ps5-screenshots-new-1851632108"><em>MGS3</em></a></span><em> </em>spy sounded to other Benson-voiced characters. And according to Benson, at least one fan directly confronted her about the role back in 2017. </p><p>“Seven years ago, at various conventions where we meet and greet with wonderful fans, somebody slipped one of these wonderful games to my table,” explained Benson. “And I said, ‘Why are you bringing me that?’ and he [said] ‘Because you’re in it’ and I said ‘Do you know? Do you know my deep, dark secret?’ and he said, ‘Yes, I do know!’ and I said, ‘Shh.... keep it quiet.’ And now here we are in 2024. So we’re doing a big reveal for our anniversary show!</p><p>Finally, the internet can stop trying to solve this one video game mystery and move on to the thousands of them out there instead. </p><p> .<br></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
