              <p><span>When I played </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/mouthwashing-steam-pc-indie-psychological-horror-1851690195"><i><span>Mouthwashing</span></i></a><span>, Wrong Organ’s psychological horror game and surprise dark horse in the </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/goty-best-games-2024-astro-bot-dragon-age-star-wars-1851726357"><span>2024 Game of the Year race</span></a><span>, I couldn’t have anticipated it would reach the level of fandom in which it got cute, </span><a href="https://www.fangamer.com/collections/mouthwashing?utm_campaign=mouthwashing-launch&amp;utm_source=twitter-steam-discord"><span>marketable plushies</span></a><span>. Its subject matter is very dark, but then again, that’s never really stopped horror games and movies from going down this path. I suppose it shouldn’t be too surprising, then, that its characters are getting stuffed toys, despite the terrible things they all go through in </span><i><span>Mouthwashing</span></i><span>’s brief runtime. What is surprising is that after all this time, the community is not only still debating the game’s horrors and morality…but now, they’ve devolved into going for each other’s throats over a plush of a character named Jimmy reimagined as a cute cat.</span></p> <p><b>Content warning: Sexual assault</b></p>  <p><span>Jimmy is the primary player character in </span><i>Mouthwashing</i><span>. He and his crew have been stranded in space after their freight ship collided with an asteroid, and the game goes over the fallout of the crash and the months that followed. Without getting too into everything that goes down, suffice it to say </span><i>Mouthwashing </i><span>is a pretty harrowing story involving some of the worst things humans are capable of, and Jimmy is the perpetrator of a lot of those crimes. He’s also an unreliable narrator attempting to cover up what he’s done, and the things he’s revealed to have done on the ship put him far beyond any possible redemption.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>Jimmy does a lot of reprehensible things in </span><i><span>Mouthwashing</span></i><span>, and the one that’s perhaps most notable is that the game implies he raped Anya, the lone woman on the ship, who is now pregnant. We don’t need to get into all the repercussions of this act here, but as you can imagine, a lot of </span><i><span>Mouthwashing </span></i><span>fans are not fans of Jimmy’s. In fact, I’d argue the game’s entire point is to make you hate this guy. He’s the villain of this story, and even if he attempts to do the right thing at the end of the game, that’s not going to be enough for some. Others, meanwhile, do find him compelling as a character whose layered story has a lot of depth. For some who find his actions unforgivable, even believing him an interesting centerpiece in </span><i><span>Mouthwashing</span></i><span>’s story goes beyond what they believe to be morally acceptable.</span></p>

 <p><span>Fast forward to August 2025, and a collectible manufacturer called </span><a href="https://www.plushshop.com/"><span>Plushshop</span></a><span> is making a cat-shaped plush of Jimmy. The store has stuffed cats based on characters from anime, TV shows, and video games, ranging from </span><i><span>Squid Game</span></i><span> to </span><i><span>One Piece</span></i><span>. When the company first announced plans to make </span><i><span>Mouthwashing </span></i><span>plushes, those plans didn’t include one for Jimmy, which led to backlash from fans. The company has since removed those initial </span><i><span>Mouthwashing </span></i><span>plushes from its store and deleted any mention of them from its social media accounts. </span></p> <p><span>However, after the shop announced its Jimmy plush as a separate launch, </span><i><span>Mouthwashing </span></i><span>fans jumped on the website to leave negative user reviews saying that given Jimmy’s true nature, he shouldn’t be made into a cute cat plush. That alone is maybe a conversation worth having, but the comments quickly devolved into a toxic cesspool, with some people claiming that those who bought the plush were rape apologists and several comments that, for some reason, included racial slurs. I went to go look at them myself on PlusShop’s website, but the Jimmy plush seems to have been removed. We’ve reached out to PlushShop for comment on the situation and will update the story if we hear back. In the meantime, screenshots of the reviews have begun circulating on places like </span><a href="https://x.com/SecondHorn31331/status/1955290233789956236"><span>X (formerly Twitter)</span></a><span> and </span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Mouthwashing/comments/1mper2l/the_jimmy_meow_plush_from_plush_shop/"><span>Reddit</span></a><span>, but do be warned that there’s some foul language in those links.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>As someone who really enjoyed </span><i><span>Mouthwashing </span></i><span>for its exploration of the human psyche and its striking visuals, am I thrilled that its characters are being made into plushes? Not particularly. I do think it’s a bit weird to make those characters cute cats or even just regular toys. It turns a pretty horrific story into an almost absurdist display prop, and even the officially </span><a href="https://www.fangamer.com/collections/mouthwashing/products/curly-mouthwashing-plush"><span>licensed plush of a man</span></a><span> wrapped up in bandages with his painkillers made into an accessory kind of feels like a parody or shitpost, turning some of the most memorable, horrific imagery in the game into a purchasable gag. All that said, the reaction to this cat plush is so ludicrously overblown and reeks of the kind of “putting fictional characters on trial” nonsense that has plagued discussions around games like </span><i><span>The Last of Us </span></i><span>or </span><i><span>Nier </span></i><span>and that I can’t believe we’re still dealing with in 2025.</span></p>

 <p><span>Good stories are built around conflict, and in some of those stories, the perpetrators of that conflict are reprehensible people who cannot be redeemed in the eyes of the beholder. Yes, in </span><i><span>Mouthwashing</span></i><span>, one character has committed one of the most vile things a person is capable of. But he is not a real person, and he is not on trial. Liking a story in which people do terrible things is not the same as endorsing their actions, and if that goes over someone’s head, I’m surprised they’re engaging with </span><i><span>Mouthwashing </span></i><span>to begin with considering several of its characters are morally dubious, to say the least. Since some of the comments weighing in on this use racial slurs, I imagine at least some of those people putting Jimmy on trial have larger issues than a lack of media literacy.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>The root of these kinds of arguments is that there will always be people who don’t understand that others engage with art differently than they do. One thing I’ve learned in my years of writing, reading, watching, and listening to criticism is that you’ll find that there are some people who have different expectations when they voice an opinion about a work. For example, when someone lashes out at a critique, it’s often under the pretense that a critic is trying to “change” something they think is fine. When some fans voice a complaint about a game, they expect the developers to address it in a patch, and so when they see another person criticizing anything, this is the only framework they have for understanding that critique: as, effectively, a complaint to management over an issue they wish to see rectified. </span></p>

 <p><span>The same thing happens with how people engage with characters. Some people only “like” characters if they support everything they do and can stand by them in the end, so the concept of enjoying a character who does reprehensible shit is so foreign to them that it is somehow a moral failing to derive any sort of satisfaction from them, even from dissecting their actions. Because people are so fixated on their own media literacy framework, art that engages in uncomfortable topics will never be free from Tumblr-era moralizing. To people who make these arguments, “problematic” storylines are just problems to be solved, rather than a means of exploring potentially challenging or uncomfortable themes. The curtains were blue. Jimmy was a bad guy. That’s all there is to it.</span></p> <p><span>I didn’t expect to rant about this on a random Friday in August, and I certainly didn’t expect it to be over a toy cat. I really enjoyed </span><i><span>Mouthwashing</span></i><span>, but I guess it’s a good thing I didn’t get too involved with its community, because it sure seems like there are a lot of people in that community who are ill-equipped to engage with the game they’re purportedly fans of.</span></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              
              <p>“Baja Blast has consistently sparked creativity, defied expectations, and continues to be a cornerstone of the Taco Bell experience,” said Taylor Montgomery, chief marketing officer at Taco Bell, in a press release announcing Baja Midnight. Okay, calm down, Taylor. But yeah, I’ll grant you that people like Baja Blast and your newly released passionfruit-infused variation of the soda is pretty dang good.</p> <p><a href="https://www.tacobell.com/newsroom/mountain-dew-baja-midnight">While that press release</a> quote is filled with buzzwords and exaggerations, it is indeed true that the blue tropical spin on Mountain Dew known as Baja Blast has been a part of Taco Bell’s menu for 20 years and is a certified fan favorite that keeps people coming back to the Tex-Mex fast food chain. Given its popularity, it almost feels dangerous for Taco Bell to tinker with that beloved drink. Rarely do things go well when you start messing around with something as old and beloved as Baja Blast. But I’m glad someone did because Mountain Dew Baja Midnight, a new soda that will be available exclusively at Taco Bell, is a tasty spin on one of my favorite sodas. And hey, if you hate it, Baja Blast is still being sold at Taco Bell, too.</p> <p>I visited my local Taco Bell on August 14, the day Baja Midnight was released. Pulling up to the drive-thru thru I was greeted by large signs announcing the arrival of Baja Midnight. The signs were all purple and showed off the new soda, which is also purple. In the press release for the drink, Montgomery called it “Taco Bell purple.” Sure, why not?</p>

 <figure id="attachment_2000618034" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000618034"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000618034">©Taco Bell</figcaption></figure> <p>We pulled up to the drive-thru, I checked in with my app (Yeah, I’m a real Taco Bell sicko) and ordered some food and two big cups of Midnight. They were very purple, as purple and vibrant as the posters and PR images promise. I thought to myself, “Should a human being consume something so unnaturally colored and vibrant?” and then remembered I’ve been drinking energy drinks and eating at Taco Bell for decades now. If that hasn’t killed me, a weirdly purple soda won’t do it.</p> <p>I took my first big sip of Midnight after eating some Taco Bell goodness, and at first, I thought I was just drinking Baja Blast. The new soda is just as sweet and tropical-y as the OG version. Was this some strange prank Taco Bell execs were playing on customers? But a moment later, my taste buds detected the passionfruit flavor. It wasn’t very strong, and I imagine folks who love passionfruit will be disappointed by how subtle it is. For me, it worked quite well. Baja Blast is a perfect soda to pair with Taco Bell’s burritos, tacos, and quesadillas. I was worried that Midnight would ruin that combo. Instead, the subtle passionfruit just offers a new way to experience Baja Blast.</p> <p>In the future, I’ll still continue to order Baja Blast, but I expect that on some trips to Taco Bell, I’ll want to shake things up and Baja Midnight will be there waiting for me, offering up an ever-so-slightly tartier and sweeter spin on the OG drink. So good job, Taylor Montgomery, chief marketing officer at Taco Bell, and everyone else involved. You didn’t ruin Baja Blast and made some nice. Congrats. Now add chips to the Cantina Chicken Bowl, please.</p>

<p>If you’re pining for the days when games like <i>F-Zero</i> and <i>WipEout</i> offered up blistering fast races, then Nintendo Switch 2 launch title <i>Mario Kart World</i> might feel a little slow for you. Worry not, speed demon, as there’s another racer in the launch lineup that might just tickle your fancy. Enter: <i>Fast Fusion</i>.</p> <p>The fourth title in the Fast franchise, <i>Fast Fusion</i> takes everything that has worked well for the series over the past few generations and pumps it up to 4k / 60 fps to provide one of the Nintendo Switch 2’s most attractive and heart-pounding gameplay experiences. Here’s how long it’ll take you to experience this face-melting thrill ride in its entirety, what machines are best, and more.</p> <h2><span id="how-many-tracks-are-in-fast-fusion"></span>How many tracks are in <i>Fast Fusion</i>?<span></span></h2> <p>At launch, <i>Fast Fusion</i> offered 12 different tracks, with half of them originally from 2015’s Wii U title <i>Fast Racing Neo</i>. In late June of this year, developer Shin’en Multimedia released the first of its promised free updates that added an additional six tracks. The update also added a new rendering option and new music.</p>

 <h2><span id="what-are-some-of-the-best-machines/vehicles-in-the-game"></span>What are some of the best machines/vehicles in the game?<span></span></h2> <p>Of the 15 vehicles, or “machines” as the game refers to them, Kamagori, Spaarc, Guang Zhou, Mueller, Cebra, Mech Guyva, and Rochdale &amp; Ziro are all excellent choices. That said, if you’re just starting out, the Cebra is a good way to get a feel for the game.</p> <h2><span id="how-many-people-can-play-at-once"></span>How many people can play at once?<span></span></h2>  <p><i>Fast Fusion</i> supports up to eight players when playing online, and four people can play via split-screen locally on the same Switch 2.</p> <h2><span id="how-long-does-it-take-to-beat-fast-fusion"></span>How long does it take to beat <i>Fast Fusion</i>?<span></span></h2> <p><i>Fast Fusion</i> demands that you become adept at rapidly dodging obstacles, alternating between color modes to match on-track speed boosts, and managing your own personal boost meter. Races in <i>Fast Fusion</i> are extraordinarily fast, and a mere one or two mistakes can cost you the whole race.</p>

 <p>Success and completion in <i>Fast Fusion</i> will come down to how well you can master these intriguing mechanics and overcome its Championship mode. There are multiple cups to beat on your way to finishing this mode, but you can’t just eek your way through them with placement.</p> <p>Instead,<i> Fast Fusion</i> requires you to purchase the Championship mode cups using currency you earn from racing. Since this currency is also used to purchase new vehicles, you’ll probably need to repeat some cups a few times to have enough to unlock everything you need to overcome future cups.</p>

 <p>When you mix <i>Fast Fusion</i>‘s challenging gameplay with a reliance on currency over placement, you get a game with a playtime that is hard to nail down. But if you’re skipping new vehicle purchases and focusing solely on unlocking and finishing cups, <b>you can probably see the end of the Championship mode in 2-3 hours</b>.</p> <p>There’s more to do after you complete Championship mode, however. You can check out Time Attack mode to see how quickly you can clear tracks, or dive into Super Hero mode for a significantly more challenging racing experience. And though <i>Fast Fusion</i>‘s multiplayer functionality leaves a bit to be desired thanks to lack of matchmaking, it can still be a fun diversion with friends.</p> <p>All-in-all, <i>Fast Fusion</i> is a fast, frenetic racing title that offers Nintendo Switch 2 owners something truly nerve-rattling (in a good way) to play on their new hardware. For only $14.99, you could make considerably worse decisions while perusing the eShop.</p> <hr> <p><i>Fast Fusion</i> is available now exclusively on Nintendo Switch 2.</p>
