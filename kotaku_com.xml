            <p>You might be wondering why a video game website like <em>Kotaku</em> is writing about sports, but the connection between games and sports runs much deeper than the annual release of <em>Madden</em>. Super Bowl ads tie the year’s biggest sporting event to every facet of our culture, serving as annual conversation pieces thanks to their high-concept ideas, celebrity appearances, and big-budget production value. The event <a href="https://www.nfl.com/news/super-bowl-lvi-total-viewing-audience-estimated-at-over-208-million" target="_blank" rel="noopener">draws nine-figure viewership every year</a>, so whether they’re shilling chips, cars, or crypto, Super Bowl ads tend to pull out all the stops. Video game ads during the big game are no exception, and developers and publishers have put out some real standout commercials during the Super Bowl over the years. Let’s look at a few of the best (and worst) video game ads to ever grace a football intermission.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/overwatch-anran-face-comparison-change-voice-fareeha-2000666873</link>
            <guid>1429948</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><span>Fareeha Andersen, the voice actor behind Anran, </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/overwatch-2-spotlight-story-vendetta-cinematic-new-heroes-2000665327"><i><span>Overwatch</span></i><span>’s newest fire-wielding hero</span></a><span>, has thrown her support behind an ongoing fan movement begging Blizzard to redesign her character.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>If you open the comments section of just about any </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/overwatch-2-spotlight-new-heroes-perks-stadium-returning-2000665736"><i><span>Overwatch</span></i></a> <span>social media post, you’ll likely see dozens if not hundreds of fans spamming comparison images of Anran as she appears in the game versus how she looked in the animated trailer for Wuyang, her younger brother and a support hero added to the game last year. </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/overwatch-anran-kiriko-juno-face-edit-reaction-change-2000666138"><span>The difference is pretty stark</span></a><span>, with her original design having sharper features and a longer nose.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>The Anran that showed up in </span><i><span>Overwatch </span></i><span>itself looks pretty different, with a smaller nose, rounded face, and a </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/overwatch-heroes-characters-hotter-young-skins-collab-2000665796"><span>distinct resemblance to previous heroes Kiriko and Juno</span></a><span>. This has fans calling her another example of </span><i><span>Overwatch</span></i><span>’s “same face syndrome” in which characters, women especially, tend to all look alike.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><span>Now that fans have gotten loud about it, Andersen has responded in a video that supports the fan movement, with her calling on Blizzard to make Anran look more like her original appearance.</span></p>   <p><span>“I got to mourn Anran between the design I had hoped for her and the design we ended up with,” Andersen says. “Because I think in her comic and the cinematic Elemental Kin, there was a precedent set by it. There was an unspoken promise that said, ‘We are going to challenge the beauty standards plaguing—ransacking—media these days,’ right? The ozempic-chic, the ‘contour your nose, you have no nose, the tiniest nose,’ and I think because of that precedence, people feel understandably let down.”</span></p>

 <p><span>She continued, “</span><i><span>Overwatch</span></i><span> is a trailblazer at challenging that, right? Of trying to break those molds, trying to explore the bounds of what it means to be good, what it looks like to be heroic, and I think the result we got says something else. It says something that leaves a bad taste in our mouths. It’s not the bold, optimistic swing that we know </span><i><span>Overwatch</span></i><span> to make.”</span></p>

 <p><span>Andersen says that she has shared the community’s concerns with the Blizzard team, and she hopes that they see and hear all of the feedback. She encourages others to do so as well with “boldness and kindness.” We’ve reached out to Blizzard for comment on the situation and will update the story if we hear back.</span></p> <p><span>Given the massive response (seriously, you can’t look at pretty much any of </span><i><span>Overwatch</span></i><span>’s social media channels without seeing people spamming the comments about this), I would be surprised if Blizzard doesn’t make some changes, but it’s probably not going to be overnight. Anran is currently playable as part of a testing phase before her proper launch tomorrow, February 10, alongside four other heroes as part of the game’s next season.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><span>There isn’t time for Blizzard to update her look before she’s in the game but maybe in a future patch we’ll see some of those more distinct features come back.</span></p>

            <title><![CDATA[Sony Announces The Big PlayStation 5 Showcase Fans Are Waiting For And It’s a Long One]]></title>
            <link>https://kotaku.com/ps5-showcase-sony-marvel-wolverine-release-date-2000666866</link>
            <guid>1429852</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>It’s felt like it’s been a while since Sony’s <a href="https://kotaku.com/playstation-5-2025-ghost-yotei-sales-plus-price-hike-2000653527">last big gaming showcase</a>. We’ve had smaller ones but nothing that felt like a real preview of the PlayStation 5’s next chapter. That seems like it’s about to change. Sony confirmed there’s a new State of Play airing later this week and it’s a long one.</p> <p>It starts at 5:00 p.m. ET on February 12 and will run over an hour. “Tune in live this Thursday for 60+ minutes of news, gameplay updates, and announcements from game studios across the globe,” reads an announcement <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2026/02/09/state-of-play-returns-this-thursday-february-12/">on the PlayStation Blog</a>. “February’s State of Play will spotlight eye-catching third-party and indie games headed to PS5, along with the latest from teams at PlayStation Studios.”</p>

 <p>Unlike some State of Play showcases that focus on a specific game, third-party publishers, or PS VR (remember those?), this one looks like it has the potential to include everything. Does that mean we’ll finally hear about a rumored new<a href="https://kotaku.com/god-of-war-sony-santa-monica-cory-barlog-2000618215"> <em>God of War</em> game</a> or get our first tease of <em>Final Fantasy VII Remake</em> part three? Possibly. News on this year’s already announced blockbusters, like Insomniac’s <em>Wolverine</em>, is a safer bet.</p> <p>Earlier today, the Latin America PlayStation Store briefly <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GamingLeaksAndRumours/comments/1qzjskk/the_latin_american_playstation_store_lists/">appeared to leak a third quarter release window</a> for the new Marvel action game, suggesting it’ll arrive sometime over the summer between July and September. Other upcoming Sony published games include Housemarque’s roguelike shooter<em> Saros</em> and Arc System Works’ fighting game <em>Marvel Tōkon: Fighting Souls</em>. The <em>Halo Combat Evolved</em> remake is also coming to PS5 in 2026. Will it be Microsoft’s debut at a Sony showcase? Stranger things have happened at this point.</p>
