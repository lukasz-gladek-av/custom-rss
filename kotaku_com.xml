Each set adds a bunch of new abilities, enemies, and gameplay wrinkles to the compulsively replayable formula, and can be picked up via a current 15 percent off sale for just $10 total. Not a bad deal if you don’t mind installing the Epic Games Store launcher and playing there (<em>Vampire Surivovrs </em>is also free-to-play on mobile and just $5 on every other platform). </p><p>But the <em>Vampire Survivors</em> giveaway is just the start of Epic Games’ annual (<span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/epic-games-store-pc-profitable-google-court-case-apple-1850996972&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/epic-games-store-pc-profitable-google-court-case-apple-1850996972">and fruitless?</a></span>) attempt to take some PC gaming market share away from Valve.

Instead of targeting enemies or controlling attacks, you simply move an 8-bit character around, collecting orbs and selecting power-ups as they auto-attack their way from lowly peasant to godlike warrior, at which point death shows up to end your run. It sounds simple enough, but try it once and before you know it you’ll be up way past your bedtime hooked on the magic of the 2022 GOTY contender. </p><p>.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

While Arrowhead Game Studios won’t confirm that future collaborations will be priced lower than that, it is giving away the second set in the crossover  to try to win back fans heading into the end-of-year break. </p><p>“Firstly, we are gifting to everyone the planned second wave of the <em>Helldivers</em> x <em>Killzone</em> collaboration items today, free of charge,” the devs <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/553850/view/516322672418750732?l=english&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/553850/view/516322672418750732?l=english" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">wrote in a new blog post</a></span>. “The distribution of those items will begin shortly, in two waves. As such we’re also going to extend the duration of the items currently in the Superstore from 5 days to 10 days so that you have a chance to get hold of it and reduce the risk of missing out.”</p><p>At issue is the fact that <em>Helldivers 2</em> is a $40 game charging free-to-play prices for new skins as part of a potential slippery slope, amid its expanding post-launch monetization strategy. Arrowhead’s CEO made the argument that premium sets like the <em>Killzone </em>collaboration are how the company can afford to keep major updates, like the recent introduction <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/helldivers-2-illuminate-omens-tyranny-free-update-1851720355&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/helldivers-2-illuminate-omens-tyranny-free-update-1851720355">of the Illuminate enemy faction, completely free</a></span>. </p><figure id="" data-id="16ad83dcdf0f50c52c5e25c62311903d" data-recommend-id="image://16ad83dcdf0f50c52c5e25c62311903d" data-format="png" data-width="1105" data-height="141" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A screenshot shows comments from Arrowhead's CEO.

" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>But many players felt like it was crossing a line and out of step with the game’s previous pattern of releasing new items as unlockable in $10 battle passes (which can be partly paid for with currency slowly accumulated in game). In fact, the <em>Killzone</em> set was originally supposed to be part of a Warbond, but the studio decided against that over concerns about a backlash to that as well. “Some of you are not happy with the prices of the items and we will revisit this,” the company responded in its latest update.</p><p>In addition to lengthening the stay of new crossover items in the shop’s monthly rotation, it sounds like Arrowhead is also looking at a way to have a secondary shop of items that never changes so that latecomers always have a chance to buy the more highly sought-after crossover merch. Some fans worried that this latest economic encroachment was due to publisher Sony’s meddling, but CEO Shams Jorjani said in the <em>Helldivers 2</em> Discord that that wasn’t the case. “It’s a partnership but we are in the driving seat behind the decisions,” he wrote. “This one is on us.”</p><p>.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
