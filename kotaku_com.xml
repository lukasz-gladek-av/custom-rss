              <p>Geoff Keighley may not be opening a portal to hell after all. Roleplaying game fans have desperately linked <a href="https://kotaku.com/game-awards-statue-elder-scrolls-6-geoff-keighley-2000651010">The Game Awards’ hell statue</a> to a new trademark application filed Tuesday and <a href="https://mp1st.com/news/report-tga-statue-mystery-solved-new-divinity-trademark-uncovered-as-new-icon-matches-statue">reported by games publication <em>MP1ST</em></a>. A law firm <a href="https://euipo.europa.eu/eSearch/#details/trademarks/019288420">filed a European trademark application</a> on Tuesday under the name&nbsp;<em>Divinity,&nbsp;</em>and the symbol in the accompanying stylized graphic certainly does look familiar.</p> <p>Two other trademark applications, showing similar imagery, were filed alongside the&nbsp;<em>Divinity</em> one. One looks to be of a person tied up in a spiderweb, and the other has a striking similarity, again, to the symbol overlaid on the Game Awards statue. The trademark application for&nbsp;<em>Divinity</em> categorizes it under computer game programs and video game software, as well as books, clothing, board games, and other “entertainment services.” No other information is available in the application to link the trademark to either the Game Awards statue or to <em>Divinity: Original Sin</em> and&nbsp;<em>Baldur’s Gate 3</em> developer Larian Studios.</p>

 <p><em>Kotaku</em> has reached out to Larian Studios for comment on the trademark application and its connection to the Game Awards statue. A Larian Studios representative did not mention&nbsp;<em>Divinity: Original Sin 3</em>, but said: “We are releasing <a href="https://x.com/Cromwelp/status/1998477127478554899">Divinity: Original Sin 2 on Next Gen</a> but weren’t going to announce it until a bit later, so please keep an eye out!”</p>

 <p>Michael Douse, Larian Studios publishing director, <a href="https://x.com/Cromwelp/status/1998484634397479293">also posted to X addressing the rumors</a>,saying “there aren’t currently any plans for a new <em>Divinity Original Sin 3</em> game but once we are ready to show what we’ve been working on we will.”</p>

 <p>Larian Studios announced in 2024 it’s working on two projects. All founder Swen Vincke would say, at the time, <a href="https://kotaku.com/baldurs-gate-3-larian-studios-next-game-excalibur-1851509450">was that one is codenamed Excalibur</a>. The studio is coming off of the massive success of <em>Baldur’s Gate 3</em>, released in 2023. But before&nbsp;<em>Baldur’s Gate 3</em>, Larian Studios was best known as the maker of the <em>Divinity</em> series, starting with 2002’s <em>Divine Divinity</em> and its 2004 sequel,&nbsp;<em>Beyond Divinity</em>. It’s published six different <em>Divinity</em> games, as well as expansion packs and enhanced editions of the games. The last <em>Divinity</em> game,&nbsp;<em>Divinity: Original Sin 2</em>, was released in 2017. <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/larian-started-work-on-baldurs-gate-3-dlc-then-canceled-it-the-studio-was-elated">Asked about&nbsp;<em>Divinity: Original Sin 3</em> in 2024</a>, Vincke wouldn’t say anything except that whatever the studio’s next game is was “different than what you think it is,” yet “still familiar.”</p> <p>The Game Awards are just days away, so it’s unlikely that Larian Studios will say much about the trademark application or its potential link to the mysterious statue before the big show. But for many, that doesn’t matter: People are still holding out hope that there’s something more than simply an enhanced version of <em>Divinity: Original Sin 2</em> to be announced at The Game Awards on Thursday.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Final Fantasy VII Remake Almost Ruined Cloud’s Sword]]></title>

              <p><em>Final Fantasy VII</em>‘s Cloud Strife has two defining characteristics: he suffers from repressed emotional trauma and carries a giant sword. Square Enix almost toyed with ruining one of those when it was originally planning to develop the <a href="https://kotaku.com/final-fantasy-vii-remake-the-kotaku-review-1842697312">current</a> <a href="https://kotaku.com/final-fantasy-7-rebirth-review-ps5-1851276129">remake</a> <a href="https://kotaku.com/final-fantasy-7-remake-rebirth-switch-2-xbox-port-part-3-2000629254">trilogy</a>.</p> <p>The Ex-Soldier’s iconic Buster Sword looks like a six-foot butcher’s knife. While fans love it, the RPG publisher was worried it might not look realistic enough for the real-world aesthetic its Unreal Engine homages to the classic PS1 game were chasing. Maybe what looked good with blocky polygons back in 1997 wouldn’t fly in a less cartoony overhaul.</p>

 <p>“While making <em>Remake</em>, there was this aspect of the weight and how Cloud swings [the sword] around with one hand that sort of felt like it would weaken the sense of realism, you know?” director Naoki Hamaguchi recently recalled <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKxyZ5DsgSs">in an interview</a> with YouTuber Julien Chièze, according to a translation by <a href="https://x.com/ShinraArch/status/1997787393253118017/photo/1">Shinra Archeology</a>.</p>

 <p>“So at the time, when we were making <em>Remake</em>, there was some discussion about whether we should give Cloud a more realistic version of the Buster Sword,” he continued. “But it was just too iconic, and if we’d made it just a regular old sword, players wouldn’t accept it…in the end we stayed faithful to the OG and a whole new generation of people fell in love with it, so I think it was the right call.”</p> <p>It’s hard to know just how serious Hamaguchi is being or just how real the concerns and doubts raised in those original meetings were. Take away his Buster Sword and Cloud is just a spikey-haired emo kid slowly having a psychological break with reality. Much harder for all the fans to cosplay as during conventions.</p>
