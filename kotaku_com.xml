              <p>Three days ago <a href="https://kotaku.com/borderlands-4-sale-discount-everwild-leak-helldivers-performance-2000635349">Ubisoft announced</a> that <em>Assassin’s Creed </em>head honcho&nbsp;Marc-Alexis Côté was leaving the company. “Marc-Alexis Côté has chosen to pursue a new path elsewhere outside of Ubisoft,” said a spokesperson at the time. Except, now Côté is insisting that’s not how it went down, and that he was in fact “asked to step aside.”</p> <p>Marc-Alexis Côté has been running everything <em>Assassin’s Creed</em> for almost two decades, overseeing a vast number of games in the enormous franchise. But it’s also been a tumultuous time of change for the cash-strapped Ubisoft, leading to March’s announcement of a major <a href="https://kotaku.com/ubisoft-tencent-assassins-creed-far-cry-rainbow-six-1851772796">business relationship with Tencent</a>, in which the French company took a $1.25 billion bailout from the Chinese firm. This led to the announcement of a new co-owned subsidiary that would take over the production of <em>Assassin’s Creed</em>, eventually announced a couple of weeks back as Vantage Studios. The joint-owned venture was created to take over the running of the <em>Assassin’s Creed</em> franchise, its name revealed just a couple of weeks ago. This week, <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/i-did-not-walk-away-former-assassins-creed-boss-says-he-didnt-resign-he-was-asked-to-step-aside-by-ubisoft/">according to&nbsp;<em>VGC</em></a>, an internal memo was sent to staff from Vantage’s co-CEOs Charlie Guillemot and Christophe Derennes stating that Côté was “offered a role as part of Vantage Studios’ leadership, but declined.”</p>

 <p>“Following the organizational restructuring announced in March 2025,” <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/assassins-creed-franchise-boss-departs-ubisoft">Ubisoft told&nbsp;<em>IGN</em> in a statement</a>, “Marc-Alexis Côté has chosen to pursue a new path elsewhere outside of Ubisoft. While we are saddened to see him go, we’re confident that our talented teams will carry forward the strong foundation he helped build.”</p>

 <p>But Côté has now <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7384672277055012864/">taken to his LinkedIn page</a> to claim a very different version of events. “The past 24 hours have been deeply emotional,” his statement begins, sharing that people’s messages sent to him have meant a great deal. However, he noted that a recurring theme in those messages was people’s surprise that he had “chosen” to leave <em>Assassin’s Creed</em>, “especially given the passion I still hold for it.” Except, he says, that’s not what happened. “The truth is simple: I did not make that choice.”</p>

 <p>Reading between the lines of Côté’s post, it seems that the role he was offered by Ubisoft was far more like a demotion. “Ubisoft decided to transfer the leadership of the Assassin’s Creed franchise to someone closer to its new organizational structure,” said the former boss. “A different position was mentioned, but it did not carry the same scope, mandate, or continuity with the work I had been entrusted with in recent years.”</p>

 <p>Insisting he holds no resentment, and still greatly values his time at Ubisoft, Côté is unequivocal in his position:</p> <blockquote><p>“I also owe it to my teams, past and present, to say this plainly:<br> I did not walk away.<br> I stayed at my post until Ubisoft asked me to step aside.”</p></blockquote> <p>Often when long-term leadership are let go companies will issue statements suggesting it was all amicable, not just to save face, but to offer the person leaving the dignity of not looking like they were fired. And it seems technically true that as staff were told, he&nbsp;<em>was</em> offered a leadership role, just one that wasn’t the job he’d had for 20 years and wanted to continue.</p> <p>Similarly, Ubisoft’s statement to&nbsp;<em>IGN</em> isn’t an outright lie, but just ambiguous enough to suggest the decision was Côté’s rather than its own. It’s true that after not wanting to take a likely demotion he <em>did</em> “chose to pursue a new path elsewhere,” but it’s clearly designed to make everything seem a lot more amicable and positive than it seems it really was. And the consequence of that certainly didn’t work out in Côté’s favor.</p>

              <p>From unexpected power outages that can leave your home in the dark to weekend camping trips where you still need to charge devices and run small appliances, these portable power stations deliver peace of mind when you need it most. Jackery’s Explorer 1000 has long been the bestseller in this category with its 1500W output but right now there’s a game-changing deal that changes everything: The <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4831/">much more powerful Jackery Explorer 2000 (2200W) just dropped to $799, down from $1,499, matching the original price of that classic Explorer 1000</a>. With $700 slashed off and hitting an all-time low, this is hands-down the smartest buy on Amazon.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4831/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Favorite Power Generator</h2>
<p>Jackery Explorer 2000 boasts an <strong>impressive 2042Wh of capacity with three AC outlets that provide 2200W of continuous power</strong>. That means you’ve got the capability to power a full-size fridge for over 15 hours, your internet router and laptop during a blackout for days on end or <strong>charge your phone more than 150 times in a single recharge</strong>.</p>
<p>By virtue of having the 2200W output, you have the luxury of plugging power-hungry devices like microwaves, coffee makers or power tools with no fear of overloading. That <strong>USB-C PD 100W port</strong> comes in very convenient so you fast-charge laptops and tablets immediately without having to carry around big power strips. With this amount of capability, it’s perfect in home backup emergency applications, yet it’s also convenient in RV trips, tailgate parties or to power tools at remote construction job sites.</p>



<p>Despite only weighing 39.5 pounds, the <strong>Explorer 2000 is 41% lighter and 34% smaller</strong> compared to similar 2kWh lithium iron phosphate power stations. That weight disparity becomes enormous when you hoist it out of your garage and into your vehicle, or from vehicle to campsite. Jackery was able to do this with the application of CTB technology taken from the design of electric vehicles that mounts the battery cells internally into the structure itself.</p>
<p>Normal AC charging <strong>gets the battery from dead to 80% in a very impressive 66 minutes</strong> so you can give it a quick top up before you go. In a real hurry? Emergency Super Charging via the companion app gets it to full in 102 minutes. And for those who love solar independence, the unit will take up to 400W of solar panel (sold separately) and recharge to full in approximately six hours of good sun. There’s even a silent charging mode that operates at under 30 decibels while still giving you a full charge in five hours.</p>
<p>At this all-time-low price of only $799, you’re getting high-grade backup power that literally could save the day during the next storm or blackout.</p>
