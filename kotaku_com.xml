Then there are the more nitty gritty details like how magic is getting brought in or what exactly happened in the final scene of season one. Well we have all the info you need to go into season two.</p><figure id="" data-id="afpvuwnfoibrncd6upmy" data-recommend-id="image://afpvuwnfoibrncd6upmy" data-format="png" data-width="800" data-height="88" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Spoiler warning graphic." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><span data-id="afpvuwnfoibrncd6upmy" data-recommend-id="image://afpvuwnfoibrncd6upmy" data-format="png" data-width="800" data-height="88" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Spoiler warning graphic." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="5ea1426854f2b37a9085f687a4764e4d" data-recommend-id="image://5ea1426854f2b37a9085f687a4764e4d" data-format="jpg" data-width="950" data-height="535" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Jinx holds up a shark-shaped rocket launcher, preparing to fire." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Jinx holds up a shark-shaped rocket launcher, preparing to fire." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Netflix</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="5ea1426854f2b37a9085f687a4764e4d" data-recommend-id="image://5ea1426854f2b37a9085f687a4764e4d" data-format="jpg" data-width="950" data-height="535" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Jinx holds up a shark-shaped rocket launcher, preparing to fire." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Great question! We have no idea! Season one didn’t really wrap up any of the larger conflicts at play in the world of <em>Arcane</em>. Instead, it left things on the precipice of all out war. To that end, Jinx launched a rocket directly into the chambers of Piltover’s ruling council. That leaves a lot of major players from season one with a big question mark over their heads. Jayce, Mel, and Caitlyn’s mother Cassandra are all within the council at the time. Trailers for season two have kept the fallout of this attack underwraps but Caitlyn appears on the warpath, so it is likely her mom was a casualty of the attack. Whatever the death toll is revealed to be, you can be sure this battle will be the match that lights the powder keg of season two.</p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="e0cbdbb65aae89941f0ed456b4ad6a08" data-recommend-id="image://e0cbdbb65aae89941f0ed456b4ad6a08" data-format="jpg" data-width="962" data-height="543" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="A police officer holds up a baton while a masked officer stands to the right." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A police officer holds up a baton while a masked officer stands to the right." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Netflix</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="e0cbdbb65aae89941f0ed456b4ad6a08" data-recommend-id="image://e0cbdbb65aae89941f0ed456b4ad6a08" data-format="jpg" data-width="962" data-height="543" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="A police officer holds up a baton while a masked officer stands to the right." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>The central conflict around which all of <em>Arcane </em>revolves is the growing tension between the cities of Piltover and Zaun. The former is a thriving city full of wealth and technology and home to people like Caitlyn and Jayce. The latter is an undercity beneath it that is a relative slum in comparison to the grandeur of Piltover. Due to the constant pollution of Zaun it has become the home of the poor and disenfranchised, which also means crime runs rampant. As a result, Piltover heavily polices the area and has created a major class divide. This is where Vi and Jinx grew up.</p><p>Season one saw these class tensions come to a head in a huge skirmish on the streets of Zaun that ended with the death of de facto leader and crime lord Silco. Season two teasers tell us that the production of the drug Shimmer is still occuring in Zaun, even without Silco, so Caitlyn and a group of Enforcers are coming in to put an end to it all. I’m sure nothing bad will happen.</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="567bba4f5d10f4fbbcc7e89c3e4deb0d" data-recommend-id="image://567bba4f5d10f4fbbcc7e89c3e4deb0d" data-format="jpg" data-width="1137" data-height="640" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Vi and Jinx stand close to each other with fog surrounding them." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Vi and Jinx stand close to each other with fog surrounding them." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Netflix</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="567bba4f5d10f4fbbcc7e89c3e4deb0d" data-recommend-id="image://567bba4f5d10f4fbbcc7e89c3e4deb0d" data-format="jpg" data-width="1137" data-height="640" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Vi and Jinx stand close to each other with fog surrounding them." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>While <em>Arcane </em>is a tale of two cities, it is even more a tale of two sisters. Vi and Powder (who grows up to be Jinx during the events of season one) are the heart of the show. Act one of season one focused on the pair’s upbringing in Zaun, which ended in their separation with Vi thinking Powder was dead and Powder being taken under the wing of Silco. The rest of the season revolved around Vi’s attempt to save her sister (now going by the name Jinx) from the influence of Silco.</p><p>That didn’t end up working out and by season one’s end Vi had come to terms with the idea that Jinx is no longer her sister. Season two positions their final confrontation as the main event, with Vi even admitting her sister is gone and that only Jinx remains. Along with Caitlyn, she’s ready to take down Jinx no matter what. </p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="6729833699de310bb042b2cce798d462" data-recommend-id="image://6729833699de310bb042b2cce798d462" data-format="jpg" data-width="1219" data-height="686" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="A close up of Caitlyn in uniform looking angry." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A close up of Caitlyn in uniform looking angry." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Netflix</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="6729833699de310bb042b2cce798d462" data-recommend-id="image://6729833699de310bb042b2cce798d462" data-format="jpg" data-width="1219" data-height="686" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="A close up of Caitlyn in uniform looking angry." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>At the start of season one Caitlyn is shown to be a Piltover citizen whose heart is in the right place, even if she doesn’t understand the realities of the world. As a rookie enforcer she wants to uphold justice and the law, but quickly finds after teaming up with Vi and falling into the city’s larger conflict that no side is without blood on its hands. Vi opens her up to the humanity of Zaun’s inhabitants, while betrayals from crooked enforcers above her show her that maybe this isn’t all black and white. Even after the final skirmish of season one, Caitlyn seems like a person who truly wants to change the relationship between Zaun and Piltover to change for the betterment of both sides.</p><p>Of course if her mom is dead that changes things. Season two already looks to put Caitlyn on the warpath, but grief may be blinding her temporarily. With the council attacked, Caitlyn seems to be something of a leader for the city now, and Jinx has fallen into a similar role in Zaun. Maybe the two will still find a way to overcome the cycles of violence their cities have been stuck in for years.</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="356ffe15c13f7bdae77826efd2c3e961" data-recommend-id="image://356ffe15c13f7bdae77826efd2c3e961" data-format="jpg" data-width="962" data-height="543" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="A close up of Ambessa wearing a red and black top with a fur-lined shoulder." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A close up of Ambessa wearing a red and black top with a fur-lined shoulder." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Netflix</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="356ffe15c13f7bdae77826efd2c3e961" data-recommend-id="image://356ffe15c13f7bdae77826efd2c3e961" data-format="jpg" data-width="962" data-height="543" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="A close up of Ambessa wearing a red and black top with a fur-lined shoulder." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Mel’s mother played a relatively small part in <em>Arcane </em>season one, but that will likely change in the final season. When she arrived in Piltover, Ambessa quickly showed herself to be a cunning political and military mind who is very interested in guiding the city in a way that benefits her. Specifically she wants in on weaponized Hextech, the technology Jayce invented. With the council potentially out of the way, Ambessa is in a great position to grab control of Piltover, which would only mean bad things for the relationship between it and Zaun.</p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="47ad84ed10ecb9cb3a752afddac1588a" data-recommend-id="image://47ad84ed10ecb9cb3a752afddac1588a" data-format="jpg" data-width="1137" data-height="640" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="A mysterious mage summons blue swirling magic with a staff." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A mysterious mage summons blue swirling magic with a staff." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Netflix</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="47ad84ed10ecb9cb3a752afddac1588a" data-recommend-id="image://47ad84ed10ecb9cb3a752afddac1588a" data-format="jpg" data-width="1137" data-height="640" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="A mysterious mage summons blue swirling magic with a staff." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p><em>League of Legends</em> is full of magic wielders, but <em>Arcane </em>has almost none in its first season. The closest thing we have is a mysterious mage saving Jayce in his youth as well as the understanding that Hextech is essentially using science to harness magical potential. Throughout season one, Viktor’s experiments with Hexteach leaned closer and closer to unlocking the mysteries of the arcane. With the promise that <em>Arcane</em>’s end will open the path for more<em> LoL</em> adaptations in the future, it’s a pretty sure bet that these loose ends will be tied up soon. This show is called <em>Arcane </em>after all.</p><hr><p>The final season of <em>Arcane </em>will air on Netflix in three acts. With the first releasing on November 9, the second on November 16, and the third on November 23.</p><p>.</p></div></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

But getting the old content working in newer versions of the <em>Halo </em>engine was very tricky. </p><p>The main community member who helped lead the charge for getting the Earth City demo finished and playable in the <em>Master Chief Collection </em>was Steven “General_101" Garcia. According to the post, he was a “one-man army” and helped improve the demo’s art, scripts, and more. Then other modders, including Ludus, Neo Te Aika, Sean T, xScruffyDaSasquatchx, and Killzone, hopped in to finish up the level and make it play like the original E3 demo. </p><p>The remastered <em>Halo 2</em> E3 Demo arrives November 9 as a free mod on Steam Workshop for PC players. </p><p> .<br></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

WWE Women’s Champion Nia Jax looked to destroy WWE World Champion Liv Morgan in a match to determine the first-ever women’s Crown Jewel champion. The WWE Women’s Tag Team Champions champions Bianca Belair and Jade Cargill aimed to defy the odds in a fatal four-way match. </p><p>Could Bronson Reed live up to the expectations when engaged in battle with World Champion Seth Rollins? This event had an array of talent that could have all been viable options to make our pound-for-pound rankings this month, however, there can only be 10.

In the last few weeks, Nia Jax and WWE World Champion Liv Morgan have been trading insults on the mic and Money In The Bank briefcase shots in the ring, trying to get fans to care about their Crown Jewel match the WWE has been promoting as history-making. Did it make history? Technically, yes. Did fans really care? Hardly.</p><p><strong>Crown Jewel In-Ring Performance: </strong>Jax retaining the 10th spot on our rankings list is a clear indication that her matches have walked the tightrope between terrible and exciting, often taking a bump somewhere in between. Jax looked dominant throughout her Crown Jewel fight, at one point crushing Morgan with a Samoan Drop from the second rope that’ll make any spectator instinctively grab their chest. However, some of the moves looked sluggish and relied too much on her raw power as opposed to any in-ring finesse. Jax was pinned after Liv Morgan’s walking insurance policy Raquel Rodriguez caused an interference by hitting Nia in the head while the ref was distracted by Dominick “Dirty Dom” Mysterio, which ultimately allowed Morgan to hit her Oblivion finishing move. Decent effort by Jax in this contest; nonetheless, things need to progress for her if the WWE Women’s Champion looks to remain on our list.</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="c727ba149f80452ecf120ae45c42066b" data-recommend-id="image://c727ba149f80452ecf120ae45c42066b" data-format="jpg" data-width="3903" data-height="2602" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Bianca Belair and Chelsea Green in action during Crown Jewel at Mohammed Abdo Arena on November 2, 2024 in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia.

Belair and Cargill were in a multi-story feud with former champions Chelsea Green and Piper Niven, Iyo Sky and Kairi Sane, both of who were also former tag champions, and main roster newcomers, Jakara Jackson and Lash Legend. They have been booked and busy, and the television matches and angles in the previous weeks were compelling enough to convince some fanatical onlookers that Belair and Cargill could actually lose the titles. </p><p><strong>Crown Jewel In-Ring Performance: </strong>Belair never disappoints when she’s given an opportunity, and this was no different. She clearly was the “ring general” in the Fatal Four Way match against Meta-Four, Chelsea Green &amp; Piper Niven, and Damage CTRL where chaos, top rope assaults, and suplex surprises reigned supreme. She’s a star that often shines brighter than her competition, thanks to her unique blend of agility, speed, strength, and irresistible style. Cargill and Belair used the Road Warriors’ legendary “Doomsday Device” finisher on Niven to retain their titles in a fun match that will likely continue the story, with Jackson and Legend being Cargill and Belair’s next opponents. </p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="0aa7b47240029d5ff64f14028f5f9c4a" data-recommend-id="image://0aa7b47240029d5ff64f14028f5f9c4a" data-format="jpg" data-width="3980" data-height="2653" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Solo Siko puts Jimmy Uso in a submission hold during Crown Jewel at Mohammed Abdo Arena on November 2, 2024 in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Solo Siko puts Jimmy Uso in a submission hold during Crown Jewel at Mohammed Abdo Arena on November 2, 2024 in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="getty" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Photo<!-- -->: <!-- -->WWE/Getty Images<!-- --> (<!-- -->Getty Images<!-- -->)</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="0aa7b47240029d5ff64f14028f5f9c4a" data-recommend-id="image://0aa7b47240029d5ff64f14028f5f9c4a" data-format="jpg" data-width="3980" data-height="2653" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Solo Siko puts Jimmy Uso in a submission hold during Crown Jewel at Mohammed Abdo Arena on November 2, 2024 in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p><strong>Last Month’s Ranking: </strong>No. 5</p><p><strong>Last Month’s Segments: </strong>Sikoa has been the focal point of major WWE storylines for the last seven months. In just the last three months, he’s been involved in two title changes. After his own older brother Jey Uso came to Smackdown and got in his face, “The Street Champion” invaded Monday Night Raw to cost his brother the Intercontinental Championship. His Bloodline stablemates Tama Tonga and Tonga Loa then lost the WWE Tag Team titles to TNA Wrestling mainstays the Motor City Machine Guns, due to interference from the “OG Bloodline.” Some may have grown tired of the Bloodline story, but for me, things are starting to heat up again, and Sikoa is a major reason why. </p><p><strong>Crown Jewel In-Ring Performance: </strong>Sikoa continues to be solid in the ring. His offense is believable enough to dazzle, and he continued to show that growth in the OG Bloodline vs New Bloodline standoff. Sikoa sells Reigns’s Superman punch spectacularly. While his cousin started the match off hot, it didn’t take long for the new tribal chief to assert his will. Personally, I much prefer Sikoa’s version of a “Uranage” that he calls the “Spinning Solo” over his Samoan Spike, but I respect him wanting to honor the memory of the late, great wrestling legend Umaga. The spike is also what allowed the leader of the Bloodline to vanquish Reigns and later declare himself the true Original Tribal Chief, undoubtedly setting up more drama we can’t wait to watch.</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="84549931b34dd6934805daf0910cc35e" data-recommend-id="image://84549931b34dd6934805daf0910cc35e" data-format="jpg" data-width="4078" data-height="2719" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Paul &quot;Triple H&quot; Levesque presents the Crown Jewel Women's Championship to Liv Morgan during Crown Jewel at Mohammed Abdo Arena on November 2, 2024 in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia.

More recently, it has been the Women’s World Champion trying to escape from the Australian-born superstar, often hiding behind Raquel Rodriguez. Due to the WWE’s prioritizing Crown Jewel’s ascension to one of the company’s tentpole annual events, WWE was tasked with advancing the Ripley-Morgan feud, while also promoting Morgan’s Crown Jewel match with Nia Jax to determine the first-ever Crown Jewel Women’s Champion. Ripley got a legitimate eye injury in the build-up to this match, causing a halt in original plans. There is still interest in Morgan vs Ripley; however, they should wrap this story up as soon as Ripley is healthy. As for the Crown Jewel match, the lead-up was underwhelming, and the match mirrored it. </p><p><strong>Crown Jewel In-Ring Performance:</strong> Morgan has figured out how to be an underdog while also ensuring it’s believable when she picks up a win. At first glance, this is a heel vs heel match, with all parties involved technically being bad guys. However, the crowd response to Morgan made her a babyface—the hero, in wrestling terms—by default. I truly enjoy Morgan’s work in the ring, but she could benefit from either having a different finisher or a second one Oblivion. That doesn’t discredit her work or her huge win against Jax.</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="197ec76fc86d82b5c1e92743952e249f" data-recommend-id="image://197ec76fc86d82b5c1e92743952e249f" data-format="jpg" data-width="4149" data-height="2766" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Bronson Reed and Seth Rollins in action during Crown Jewel at Mohammed Abdo Arena on November 2, 2024 in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia.

A few months ago, Reed put Seth Rollins on the shelf. Once “The Architect” returned, his goal was to destroy Reed. The giant performer has looked dominant over a number of wrestlers the last few weeks, and he aimed to end Seth for good. Most weeks, they were brawling all over the arena, with the week going into their Crown Jewel match showing us Reed couldn’t be stopped </p><p><strong>Crown Jewel In-Ring Performance: </strong>For someone of Reed’s size, the 330-pound behemoth<strong> </strong>can accomplish some truly incredible feats. He takes bumps well, and he’s also good at selling. Reed knows how to wrestle “big man style,” but he’s not unbeatable. He worked really well with Rollins at Crown Jewel, even taking a nasty “Curb Stomp” on steel steps. That ultimately was the cause for the loss, but even in defeat, Reed rose up to show Rollins he’s here to stay. </p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="3871f9de65e2665ffd6ef0fcff468526" data-recommend-id="image://3871f9de65e2665ffd6ef0fcff468526" data-format="jpg" data-width="4132" data-height="2755" data-lightbox="false" data-alt=" Roman Reigns says he's the one during Crown Jewel at Mohammed Abdo Arena on November 2, 2024 in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt=" Roman Reigns says he's the one during Crown Jewel at Mohammed Abdo Arena on November 2, 2024 in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="getty" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Photo<!-- -->: <!-- -->WWE/Getty Images<!-- --> (<!-- -->Getty Images<!-- -->)</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="3871f9de65e2665ffd6ef0fcff468526" data-recommend-id="image://3871f9de65e2665ffd6ef0fcff468526" data-format="jpg" data-width="4132" data-height="2755" data-lightbox="false" data-alt=" Roman Reigns says he's the one during Crown Jewel at Mohammed Abdo Arena on November 2, 2024 in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p><strong>Last Month’s Ranking: </strong>No. 3</p><p><strong>Last Month’s Segments:</strong> In a somewhat predictable turn of events, Reigns found himself needing help. After his cousin Jimmy Uso made his return at Bad Blood, the OG Bloodline found themselves outnumbered by the New Bloodline. As a result, Reigns and Uso were being decimated week after week on Smackdown. Eventually, Jimmy was able to convince his brother Jey Uso to settle his previous issues with Reigns and help them out. The Bloodline story remains one of the most layered and intriguing stories the WWE has to offer. </p><p><strong>Crown Jewel In-Ring Performance: </strong>Roman Reigns losing to Sikoa by pinfall may be shocking to us all, but was certainly the right decision. This was another match where Reigns, being the intelligent man that he is, let his teammates work most of the match and made the tag when it mattered the most. The multi-time Wrestlemania headliner did not do much from a “wrestling” performance perspective; however, Reigns commanded the attention of not only the fans but his opponents. </p><p>Once the former champion did get his hands on Sikoa, the crowd erupted. At one point, the New Tribal Chief hit the Original Tribal Chief with the Samoan Spike, and Reigns did not kick out. Either Jimmy was late breaking it up, or Reigns forgot. Nevertheless, the bad guys walked away winners. The post-match saw The New Bloodline beating down the OG Bloodline when Sami Zayn attempted to make the save for the good guys. The match was fine, but it’s really the story that maintains its position on this ranking. Things are heating up leading into next month’s Survivor Series, and Reigns is performing near his peak.<br></p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="9f4a2bee1a231157f7692586f4e2efce" data-recommend-id="image://9f4a2bee1a231157f7692586f4e2efce" data-format="jpg" data-width="3977" data-height="2651" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Seth Rollins stomps Bronson Reed during Crown Jewel at Mohammed Abdo Arena on November 2, 2024 in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Seth Rollins stomps Bronson Reed during Crown Jewel at Mohammed Abdo Arena on November 2, 2024 in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="getty" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Photo<!-- -->: <!-- -->WWE/Getty Images<!-- --> (<!-- -->Getty Images<!-- -->)</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="9f4a2bee1a231157f7692586f4e2efce" data-recommend-id="image://9f4a2bee1a231157f7692586f4e2efce" data-format="jpg" data-width="3977" data-height="2651" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Seth Rollins stomps Bronson Reed during Crown Jewel at Mohammed Abdo Arena on November 2, 2024 in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p><strong>Last Month’s Ranking:</strong> N.A.</p><p><strong>Last Month’s Segments: </strong>After a much-needed break from the action, “The Visionary” was back to regain some momentum. Rollins took a break from focusing on future opponent CM Punk to forge a battle with a superstar on the rise, Bronson Reed. Week after week, the two were separated after brawling throughout every building they were in. Rollins remains top-level with his promos alone. With the first-ever NXT champion laid out on the go-home edition of Monday Night Raw, we all anticipated watching Rollins attempt to overcome the monster. </p><p><strong>Crown Jewel In-Ring Performance: </strong>You’d be hard-pressed to find a bad Seth Rollins match<strong>. </strong>There’s a reason the grand slam champion is always a main attraction. From the very start of the match, Rollins and Reed had the audience in their sweaty, grappling palms. At first, it appeared Reed was going over on Rollins after a “Tsunami” from Bronson in the first few minutes of the match. However, that wasn’t the case, and Rollins was able to hit a “Curb Stomp” for an implacable false finish. After a back-and-forth exhibition, Rollins found a way to win with a super “Curb Stop,” adding to his collection of top-tier performances. Although this feud with Reed hasn’t concluded, I wouldn’t object to Rollins moving on to his story with the aforementioned CM Punk.</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="414f2f9213c87c2997b74289a921f94d" data-recommend-id="image://414f2f9213c87c2997b74289a921f94d" data-format="jpg" data-width="5221" data-height="3481" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="LA Knight remains the United States Champion during Crown Jewel at Mohammed Abdo Arena on November 2, 2024 in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="LA Knight remains the United States Champion during Crown Jewel at Mohammed Abdo Arena on November 2, 2024 in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="getty" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Photo<!-- -->: <!-- -->WWE/Getty Images<!-- --> (<!-- -->Getty Images<!-- -->)</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="414f2f9213c87c2997b74289a921f94d" data-recommend-id="image://414f2f9213c87c2997b74289a921f94d" data-format="jpg" data-width="5221" data-height="3481" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="LA Knight remains the United States Champion during Crown Jewel at Mohammed Abdo Arena on November 2, 2024 in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p><strong>Last Month’s Ranking:</strong> N.A. </p><p><strong>Last Month’s Segments:</strong> Knight hasn’t been featured as much as many are clamoring for, but he’s still “MAXimized” his minutes on television. The United States Champion found himself in the middle of the issues between his two Crown Jewel opponents, Andrade and Carmelo Hayes. Hayes and Andrade competed in a series of matches that were due to culminate in a Game 7-style match at Brooklyn’s Barclays Center to determine a number one contender for Knight’s title. The U.S. Champion was the special guest referee and ensured there was no decisive winner, therefore sealing his fate. Good build-up to this triple-threat match. </p><p><strong>Crown Jewel In-Ring Performance: </strong>Based on entrance and crowd reaction alone, LA Knight was most certainly over with the live crowd. Andrade and Hayes had some creative high spots in the match, whereas Knight focused more on the ground and pound. The champion did show some athleticism when both his challengers were on the turnbuckles; he leaped up and superplexed Andrade off the top. The finish of the match was equally as clever: Knight caught Hayes while he was holding Andrade and hit the “Blunt Force Trauma,” effectively knocking them both out. Impressive showing from all three wrestlers.</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="8e0cf1dfe8e1d68ff25a6d22e2bba909" data-recommend-id="image://8e0cf1dfe8e1d68ff25a6d22e2bba909" data-format="jpg" data-width="3833" data-height="2555" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="GUNTHER returns with a submission hold on Cody Rhodes during Crown Jewel at Mohammed Abdo Arena on November 2, 2024 in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia.

With Cody Rhodes having another story occurring simultaneously, Gunther was reduced to just cutting promos. The two champions did fight on a Smackdown live event in Brooklyn. But, other than that, it’s been relatively lax for Gunther.</p><p><strong>Crown Jewel In-Ring Performance: </strong>When I think of an old-school heel WWE Champion, Gunther is the perfect personification. This match between the two world champions was technically sound and hard-hitting. Gunther laid in all of his offensive moves, and Rhodes took it. Despite the loss, Gunther wasn’t hurt by this at all. Cody needed this win more in order to cement his title run. In what some may see as an uncharacteristic move, Gunther shook hands with Rhodes and gave him the Crown Jewel ring. Where does this leave the self-proclaimed “ring general?” Well, we’re just going to have to wait and see. </p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="8ae3a52a1d8232690b8a576c2144d9c7" data-recommend-id="image://8ae3a52a1d8232690b8a576c2144d9c7" data-format="jpg" data-width="5808" data-height="3872" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Paul &quot;Triple H&quot; Levesque presents the Crown Jewel Men's Championship to Cody Rhodes during Crown Jewel at Mohammed Abdo Arena on November 2, 2024 in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Paul &quot;Triple H&quot; Levesque presents the Crown Jewel Men's Championship to Cody Rhodes during Crown Jewel at Mohammed Abdo Arena on November 2, 2024 in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="getty" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Photo<!-- -->: <!-- -->WWE/Getty Images<!-- --> (<!-- -->Getty Images<!-- -->)</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="8ae3a52a1d8232690b8a576c2144d9c7" data-recommend-id="image://8ae3a52a1d8232690b8a576c2144d9c7" data-format="jpg" data-width="5808" data-height="3872" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Paul &quot;Triple H&quot; Levesque presents the Crown Jewel Men's Championship to Cody Rhodes during Crown Jewel at Mohammed Abdo Arena on November 2, 2024 in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p><strong>Last Month’s Ranking:</strong> No. 4</p><p><strong>Last Month’s Segments: </strong>In the build to Crown Jewel, Rhodes has been trying to get his lick back from Kevin Owens. Following the Bad Blood event in Atlanta, the prizefighter attacked Cody in the parking lot. Rhodes has been seeking revenge ever since the altercation. Mutual friend Randy Orton has been trying to end this problem between Owens and Rhodes. That only angered Owens, leading him to believe the third-generation superstar was picking sides. Rhodes dealing with the RKO drama, while handling his issues with World Champion Gunther, gave viewers more than enough entertainment to continue supporting the WWE Champion. </p><p><strong>Crown Jewel In-Ring Performance: </strong>The highly acclaimed WWE Champion was slated to make history. In a match that would crown the first-ever Crown Jewel champion, Rhodes and Gunther went out and had a standard WWE main event title match. At times, it felt more physiologically based than a knock-down, all-out blood feud, which it was not. There was nothing bad about the match. It did start off slow, but that’s expected of two wrestlers without an actual story leading into the match. Rhodes showed his resilience by reversing Gunther’s sleeper and getting the pinfall on the man who has ruled over Raw. Nothing outstanding throughout the match, just a solid effort. The significance of the results lies solely upon Rhodes winning another championship for the first time.</p></div></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

To be clear, I’ve seen both variations before writing this ranking, and still would probably put him at the bottom of this list. Lucanis is a web of fascinating contradictions. On the surface, he seems like a character ripe for tiresome edgy nonsense with his brooding demeanor, magic crow wings that he uses to fly around and strike his targets from above, and the fact that the demon embodiment of Spite lives within him. But he’s also kind of a golden retriever.</p><p>Lucanis drinks more coffee than any writer you’ve met, just to stay awake and maintain control of his body, cooks for the team and remembers all their favorite foods, and he is protective of those he cares about. His story is a <em>Game of Thrones</em>-esque political drama with family ties and blood magic in the mix, and unfortunately, it can feel a bit truncated on certain playthroughs. Still, Lucanis’ inner struggle with his literal and figurative demons shines through.</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="2de1da4a1f8944ce07a2d102d5df8158" data-recommend-id="image://2de1da4a1f8944ce07a2d102d5df8158" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Taash is shown looking at something off-screen." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Taash is shown looking at something off-screen." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->BioWare / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="2de1da4a1f8944ce07a2d102d5df8158" data-recommend-id="image://2de1da4a1f8944ce07a2d102d5df8158" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Taash is shown looking at something off-screen." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>The lone qunari on the team is an interesting one. Taash joins The Veilguard initially to help the team fight the dragons they’ll face when fighting the elven gods. Though their foes are the size of buildings, their biggest fight is the one they deal with internally as they navigate the intersection of gender and culture. Taash is standing between two worlds: the Qunari one they were born in, and the Rivain one they have grown into. They feel pulled in different directions, whether that be in the way they dress, the food they eat, or the gender they identify as.</p><p>Though Taash can initially come off as bullheaded and deadpan, it’s clear they are an introspective, thoughtful person who wants to be themself, but also seeks the approval of those who have cared for them. Finding yourself when you have so many forces telling you who you’re supposed to be is a pretty universal concept, but watching <em>The Veilguard</em> wrestle with these ideas within its own world remains one of the series’ strengths, and Taash is one of the most endearing and entertaining examples under its belt.</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="a0a31dd97ff01975998753d3af1b947b" data-recommend-id="image://a0a31dd97ff01975998753d3af1b947b" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Bellara is shown looking at something in the distance as Rook approaches." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Bellara is shown looking at something in the distance as Rook approaches." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->BioWare / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="a0a31dd97ff01975998753d3af1b947b" data-recommend-id="image://a0a31dd97ff01975998753d3af1b947b" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Bellara is shown looking at something in the distance as Rook approaches." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>At first, Bellara felt primed to slip through the cracks for me. The elven mage, introduced as an expert on ancient elf technology and magic, seems scatterbrained if she’s not fixated on one of her interests. But as her story unfolds, it becomes clear that Bellara’s preoccupation with elven artifacts, lost history, and hobbies like fiction writing are all born out of a need to distract herself from her grief, and possibly make up for her failures.</p><p>When you meet her, Bellara has been hunting for a way to make the world make sense again, only for the elven gods she had known her whole life to return, and everything she knew is repeatedly flipped on its head. What does someone who seeks to restore history do when it’s constantly changing? What decisions do you make when the answers you’ve found can hurt those who have already gone through so much? Bellara is the kind of character a story like <em>The Veilguard </em>needs: as the world changes, she’s the most well-equipped to understand its significance and ponder the effects it will have on everyone when the dust settles. </p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="3d8946eeccb14873e15b9a18889f2726" data-recommend-id="image://3d8946eeccb14873e15b9a18889f2726" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Davrin is shown looking at something off-screen." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Davrin is shown looking at something off-screen." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->BioWare / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="3d8946eeccb14873e15b9a18889f2726" data-recommend-id="image://3d8946eeccb14873e15b9a18889f2726" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Davrin is shown looking at something off-screen." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p><em>The Veilguard</em>’s Grey Warden companion is a man-and-a-half. Davrin is a monster hunter who carves each of the beasts he faces into wooden statues from logs he cuts himself. He’s also a great bird-cat father to Assan, one of the last griffons who was once thought extinct in the <em>Dragon Age</em> universe. How could I not fall for the lumberjack bird-cat dad who is doomed by the narrative because he’s part of a faction that will one day go underground to die when they start to go mad from the darkspawn taint inside him?</p><p>But I digress. Davrin is one of the best examples <em>The Veilguard </em>has of a character whose very personal story has long standing ramifications for the world of <em>Dragon Age</em>. As a Warden, Davrin knows his time is relatively limited, and feels a great deal of responsibility to protect those around him. He wants to ensure that he leaves the world better than he found it. The revelations he finds in his quest fundamentally shift how the Wardens will be viewed in the annals of history, but he doesn’t lose sight of the good those still living under the banner can do. All of this is delivered with a heartfelt story of a man and his bird-cat son learning to love and live with each other. Davrin’s story has some of the greatest range in <em>The Veilguard</em>, and it’s all elevated by the dashing man in the center (I’m sorry, I’m gonna thirst for my video game boyfriends). </p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="9a15d730a57d0dee603874fc41f1a95b" data-recommend-id="image://9a15d730a57d0dee603874fc41f1a95b" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Harding is shown reading a book on a table." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Harding is shown reading a book on a table." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->BioWare / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="9a15d730a57d0dee603874fc41f1a95b" data-recommend-id="image://9a15d730a57d0dee603874fc41f1a95b" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Harding is shown reading a book on a table." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>Lace Harding could have easily been a throwaway party member in <em>The Veilguard</em>. The dwarven rogue started as a supporting character in 2014’s <em>Dragon Age: Inquisition</em>, and that’s a long time for fans to project an idealized vision of the mostly jovial scout in their minds. But Harding is so much more complex in <em>The Veilguard</em>, and a lot of it has to do with its willingness to examine the cracks in the happy-go-lucky attitude she’s been known for.</p><p>Harding becomes a centerpiece for some of the biggest reveals in dwarven lore <em>Dragon Age </em>has ever dropped, and as she uncovers truths about her people, her anger for what the dwarves have lost becomes central to her world. Things are changing for everyone in <em>The Veilguard</em>, and it often feels like Harding has no one to relate to as she carries heavy dwarven baggage on her back. Rage for what she and her people have lost doesn’t have to consume her, as justified as it might be. But one way or another, someone who once played the support role for the Inquisition becomes a pillar for the dwarven people to build upon. It’s inspiring to see.</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="acb8af2d200907522fa688e54bf69010" data-recommend-id="image://acb8af2d200907522fa688e54bf69010" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Emmrich is shown talking to Manfred in a dark area." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Emmrich is shown talking to Manfred in a dark area." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->BioWare / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="acb8af2d200907522fa688e54bf69010" data-recommend-id="image://acb8af2d200907522fa688e54bf69010" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Emmrich is shown talking to Manfred in a dark area." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>Every friend group needs a silly guy. Emmrich, a necromancer with a skeleton assistant named Manfred, fills that role. Though raising the dead sounds like dirty, scary work (and not everyone on the team is thrilled by the notion), this mage is an eccentric, kind hearted, and often goofy old man who is a joy to be around. Though death and grief are universal concepts that could be part of any universe, Emmrich spends much of his time studying and celebrating death as a cultural concept within Thedas.</p><p>Some of the most memorable scenes in <em>The Veilguard </em>are the quiet moments when he regales you with stories about his fascination with death, how we face it, and how he maintains respect for those who are gone as he brings them back. But what does a person who deals in life and death feel about his own oncoming end? What do they think when the death in question is no longer something abstract and related to people they’ve never known? Emmrich explores those ideas in his work, but once <em>The Veilguard</em> makes him confront his relationship with death, he is catapulted to one of the most memorable mages we’ve ever met in Thedas. </p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="961f9f7315f5127890e8a5f7504d01ac" data-recommend-id="image://961f9f7315f5127890e8a5f7504d01ac" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Neve looks at something off-screen." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Neve looks at something off-screen." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->BioWare / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="961f9f7315f5127890e8a5f7504d01ac" data-recommend-id="image://961f9f7315f5127890e8a5f7504d01ac" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Neve looks at something off-screen." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>Like Lucanis, your opinion on Neve might vary depending on whether you help her save her home of Minrathous in the early hours of <em>The Veilguard</em>. But in both routes, there’s something compelling about watching the mage detective in her element. Neve knows the name of a lot of the people you meet on the streets of Minrathous. Even as the elven gods are blighting cities and some of the biggest revelations of the <em>Dragon Age</em> universe are raining down upon Rook and their team, Neve doesn’t lose sight of the people on the ground who will still be struggling if and when the Veilguard accomplishes their mission to stop the gods. The question is whether she wants to fight for them from the shadows, or become a beacon of hope to pave a new path in the city.</p><p>Neve is perhaps the most concise example of <em>The Veilguard</em>’s broader thesis. Where often the series shaves down conflict and progress into factions and choices nudged by the player, <em>The Veilguard </em>feels like the series finally believes in something, rather than just showing you a nuanced ideological battle and letting you choose which one deserves to be wiped from the face of Thedas.</p><p>Neve believes that the world can be better, and is willing to do whatever it takes to find that path forward. Oppression and the structures that allow it are not choices or debates in her mind; she is here to fight for the people of Minrathous, it’s just a matter of how. This world is changing, and there are people who will be written in the history books as those who charted the course. Neve may choose to omit herself from the official stories if she can, but she won’t sit idly by while those who benefit from the way things have always been try to direct how things will be.</p></div></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
