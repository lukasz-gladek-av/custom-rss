            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>In most extraction shooters, as well as a number of online survival games, players are all-too-familiar with the necessary evil known as a global wipe, in which everyone’s inventory and stats get reset to start all players off again on the same footing. It can sting a bit, but it helps balance out the game for newcomers, as folks who’ve been playing for years could otherwise build up a virtually limitless stockpile of goodies to maintain supremacy. Upcoming PvPvE extraction shooter <i>Arc Raiders</i>, however, has some different ideas on how to implement this in a way that won’t cost everyone their precious, hard-won loot.</p> <p>In particular, the developers are trying to solve one of the biggest problems with mandatory wipes: It’s really unfair to those who only have limited windows of opportunity to play the game. It sucks when you log a few hours in one week, get tied up with life stuff for the remainder of a month, then come back to find out even the meager earnings you scored during that first week are now gone due to the wipe. <i>Arc Raiders </i>developer Embark is aiming to solve that.</p>

 <p>In a blog post titled “<a href="https://arcraiders.com/en/news/expedition-project/">Expedition Project</a>,” <i>Arc Raiders’</i> design director Virgil said that the studio “absolutely [sees] the benefits a global wipe provides [but] one thing a mandatory wipe does not do is respect the investment of those players who do not have as much time to play overall.”</p>

 <p>Enter “Projects,” a feature that unlocks after level 20 with a scheduled eight-week window to complete, after which you’ll unlock the ability to reset your character. Should you fail to finish your project within the eight-week window, you can hold on to all of the progress you made, including your gear. You can then continue your progress during the next eight-week period that opens up.</p>

Hopefully <i>Arc Raiders</i>’ Projects will solve that dilemma.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/final-fantasy-tactics-remaster-review-ivalice-chronicles-2000628040"><em>Final Fantasy Tactics: The Ivalice Chronicles</em></a> lets you train a group of newb Squires into an ultra-efficient death squad of hybrid specialists. There are so <a href="https://kotaku.com/final-fantasy-tactics-jobs-ranking-best-ivalice-chronicles-2000630679">many neat Jobs</a> and <a href="https://kotaku.com/final-fantasy-tactics-best-abilities-guide-ivalice-chronicles-2000631130">abilities to unlock</a> in this strategy RPG that, in no time at all, you’ll be wondering what the fastest way is to obtain all of them. While there are many time-honored traditions when it comes to min-maxing the grind in Square Enix’s classic, some are more effective than others. And frogs are one of the best (technically they’re toads, but frogs is funnier to say and write).</p> <p>Every action you take in combat that accomplishes something nets your character XP (experience points) and JP (job points). The first raises your regular level and the second raises your Job level and are spent to unlock abilities. You get more XP for performing actions on characters that are a higher level, and more JP the higher your overall Job level is, with bonuses for having the Double JP abilities equipped (<a href="https://kotaku.com/final-fantasy-tactics-tips-guide-ivalice-remaster-jobs-2000630228">more on that here</a>).</p>

 <p>There are roughly three tiers of grinding in <em>Final Fantasy Tactics</em>. The first is going to a place like the Mandalia Plains, killing everything but the enemy Chocobo, and then cornering it so that it keeps healing itself as your characters keep attacking it. The second is unlocking Focus from the Squire Job on every character, keeping one enemy alive in a battle, and then just spending the rest of the time having everyone keep using this ability over and over again. It’s boring and tedious, but it gets results and is easy to implement. The third is having everyone learn a dance or Bard song have them perform it on repeat. It’s similar to the Focus version but requires fewer button presses and neutralizes enemies without killing them.</p>

   <p>None of these, however, is as elegant and foolproof as the “Berserker Frog” method.&nbsp; In this version you bring someone along who can cast both the Black Mage’s Toad spell and the Mystic’s Fervor (Berserk) and Induration (Petrify) spells. You then have them turn a single remaining enemy and the rest of your party into frogs so they deal as little damage as possible. They then cast Fervor to give all of the frogs Berserk so they just keep attacking the nearest enemy. They then cast Induration on themselves to turn themselves into stone so you don’t have to keep controlling them. Your party will proceed to auto-grind for a good long while.</p>

 <p>Why not just use the actual auto-battle AI controls in <em>Final Fantasy Tactics</em>? Well, they aren’t always reliable in <em>The Ivalice Chronicles</em> remaster. Set characters with Focus to run away from battle and they just won’t use any abilities. Set someone to just heal allies and they’ll eventually still go and start killing stuff. AI control is fine for breezing through an encounter while you go make a sandwich but it won’t be nearly as effective over the same period of time as the Frog method. If you want to go above and beyond, you can keep multiple enemies alive and bring someone with the Arts of War ability to reduce the enemy’s power and speed before turning them into a frog so there’s no chance of anyone dying.</p> <p><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/finalfantasytactics/comments/1o0tcgm/comment/nieywz6/">Some fans</a> still maintain that the Focus method is simpler and faster. You send everyone to a corner of the map, set their AI to run away, and then hope they use Focus a bunch of times before killing the one enemy that’s left. But I find with the streamlined AI in the remaster, that’s just not as reliable anymore. Frogs are the way.</p>

              <p>Talented creators say the darndest things. The latest one to put his foot in his mouth is George Miller, director of the very good, fantastic, wonderful girl-power post-apocalyptic action film <i>Mad Max: Fury Road</i>, as well as many other great movies. In an interview the filmmaker gave shortly before he’s expected to lead a panel of judges at an upcoming Australian AI film festival (they generated a festival?), homeboy opened his mouth to proudly declare that “AI is here to stay.”</p> <p>In his <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2025/oct/09/ai-film-making-omni-festival-mad-max-director-george-miller-interview">interview with <i>The Guardian</i></a> (h/t <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/entertainment/movies/mad-max-fury-road-director-george-miller-disappoints-everyone-by-taking-part-in-an-ai-film-festival-ai-is-here-to-stay/">real person Megan Garside at <i>GamesRadar</i></a>), the famed filmmaker said: “AI is arguably the most dynamically evolving tool in making moving image. As a filmmaker, I’ve always been <a href="https://kotaku.com/sora-2-update-pokemon-nintendo-openai-sam-altman-ai-2000632089">driven by the tools</a>.” If he has any concerns over labor, plagiarism, and Shinra-esque data centers sucking the planet dry, they seem to be, at best, secondary.</p>

 <p>But okay, let’s hold off on the pitchforks and torches for a second and hear the writer and producer of <i>Babe</i> out:</p> <blockquote><p>It’s the balance between human creativity and machine capability, that’s what the debate and the anxiety is about […] It strikes me how this debate echoes earlier moments in art history.</p></blockquote> <p>Miller went on to loosely deliver some pseudo-historical background, comparing AI’s rise to that of oil painting in the Renaissance and photography in the mid-19th century. “It will make screen storytelling available to anyone who has a calling to it,” Miller said, echoing the common pro-AI argument that it’s some kind of democratizing force. “[Kids not yet in their teens are] making films–or at least putting footage together. It’s way more egalitarian.”</p>

These same tools that, yes, may make it easier to mush together some ideas to produce a concept of a movie or piece of art, are not only doing so at extreme cost to the planet (<a href="https://futurism.com/artificial-intelligence/ai-data-centers-electricity-bills">and people’s energy bills</a>). They’re also making it harder for aspiring creatives to make a living doing this work, as those deploying AI are largely doing so to replace functioning, compensated labor in creative endeavors (and other forms of work). Throwing a sentence at a machine to have it spit out a neat-looking idea might lower the barrier to entry, but I’m not sure how denying people the ability to make a living with their art by replacing their ability to make money by producing that art is more egalitarian.</p>

 <p>And as to kids “not yet in their teens” making films? Steven Spielberg made his first “movie” <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steven_Spielberg#Early_life_and_background">when he was but a pre-teen himself</a>, a boy scout earning a badge for an 8mm film, and that was after a youth spent filming model trains to recreate a scene from <i>The Greatest Show on Earth</i>. And he certainly wasn’t <a href="https://youtu.be/gaRN0jwoyiM?si=gSnWV7QNsOy8m51i">the only filmmaker doing such things</a> at a young age.</p> <p>So remind me again what AI is going to offer aspiring filmmakers that history has shown will already act on their passions? And if AI eats away at job opportunities for young filmmakers in a world where everyone’s just typing prompts into slop machines, how is this more egalitarian?</p>
