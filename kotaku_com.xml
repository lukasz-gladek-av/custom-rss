            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>A Mac Mini is a wonderful choice for anyone who considers the available space atop their desk to be a valuable commodity. You can get the full experience Mac has to offer, without sacrifice what limited area you have to work with. That being said, you connectivity and compatibility options on the Mac Mini itself leave a bit to be desired. It can only support a small handful of accessories at once through its limited ports. <strong>The good news is you can expand what’s possible by attaching you Mac Mini to this dedicated Mac Mini M4 dock from UGREEN</strong>. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3879/">Plus, right now, it’s discounted by 28%. Normally going for $90, you can now get it for just $65. You’ll save $25.</a></p>
<p>This compact Apple docking station just slips right under your Mac Mini which means the footprint stays exactly the same. You won’t be giving up any extra desk room for the additional compatibility the dock will bring you. It’s been designed to fit the curvature and form of your Mac Mini exactly as to appear as one cohesive unit. Underneath are several anti-slip silicone pads which both protect the dock and keep it from getting pushed around on your desk.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3879/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Added Connectivity</h2>
<p>The M4 Mac Mini dock adds five extra USB-A ports, two of which support data speeds of 5GBps while the other three supports twice that with 10GBps. You also get three USB-C ports supporting 10GBps. They are high speed, able to hand moving large files across to a flash drive or external storage like it’s nothing. You can edit 4K video or back up your data quickly and easily.</p>
<p>The dock is powered by your Mac Mini itself which means no extra cables running back behind your desk and tacking up another outlet. By connecting the dock to the Mac Mini, you are sacrificing one USB-C port, but with three new ones you’re still netting two ports.</p>
<p>You’re not just getting more USB ports though. With the dock, you’ll now have SD and TF card compatibility through it’s two card slots. These are handy to have right there at the Mac Mini, especially for photographers and video editors.</p>



<h2>Expandable Storage</h2>
<p><strong>If your Mac Mini doesn’t have enough internal storage for your needs, the dock allows you to expand by up to 8TB</strong>. The dock has a slot underneath to add on an SSD drive with support for PCI Express, NVM Express, and M.2 NVMe (drive not included).</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3879/">For a limed time, grab yourself this UGREEN Mac Mini M4 dock for its lowest price ever of $65.</a></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>In a world where (almost) everything exists online, it’s more important than ever to keep your privacy secure: That’s where a VPN (or <em>Virtual Private Network</em>) comes in. <strong>It’s your own personal internet bodyguard</strong>: It keeps your data under lock and key and your online behavior hidden from hackers, trackers and even your internet company. Of all the VPNs available, NordVPN is the world’s top service.</p> <p>NordVPN has a few very cheap plans that are really good: The <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3712/"><em>Basic</em> plan only costs around $3.09 per month (down from $11,59 per month) if you subscribe for two years</a>. f you want something with a bit more bells and whistles, the Plus package is the most popular choice: It’s <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3712/">about $3.99 monthly (down from $14.99) with the same two-year subscription</a> and comes with some handy add-ons that are nice to have if you want to get the most out of your VPN experience. Both of them are <strong>73% off the original price</strong> right now.</p> <p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3712/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See NordVPN</a></p> <h2>Safe and Secure Connection</h2> <p>NordVPN <strong>makes your connection very safe with military-grade encryption</strong>&nbsp;so your data is encrypted and no one can view it. And <strong>they don’t keep logs</strong> so your browsing history stays just that – yours, and not on their servers or tracked. If you require an extra level of protection, NordVPN offers a Double VPN feature that routes your connection through two servers for double encryption.</p>

 <p>The Plus plan adds even more protection in its Threat Protection Pro (similar to an antivirus software) which prevents annoying ads, trackers and malware that slow you down or invade your privacy. It also has NordPass which is a decent password manager (<a href="https://gizmodo.com/best-password-managers" target="_blank" rel="false noopener">check out Gizmodo’s list here</a>) that helps you store and keep your passwords safe so you don’t have to remember them. And if you worry about how many devices you can protect, <strong>NordVPN’s got you set with up to 10 simultaneous connections</strong>.</p> <p>Speed also matters when you go for a VPN, isn’t it? With <strong>over 7,000 servers spread across more than 120 sites worldwide</strong>, NordVPN gives you fast and reliable connectivity wherever you go. This makes streaming and gaming smooth and uninterrupted. You will not need to suffer from lags or buffering.</p>

 <p>If you’re still not convinced, no problem: <span><strong>NordVPN has a 30-day money-back guarantee</strong></span>. Try it, test it out with no obligation. If you don’t enjoy it, simply get your money back.</p> <p>And if you want to save even more or be able to customize your protection, NordVPN has other options too—from Basic to Complete and Prime—that give you options with additional features like encrypted cloud storage and identity theft protection. But in the end, for great privacy and security at a cost that won’t hurt the budget, NordVPN’s Basic (and Plus) plan is where it’s at.</p> <p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3712/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See NordVPN</a></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Summer is over. Sorry, folks. September is here, and even though the season doesn’t technically end until September 22, you and I both know that date is meaningless. Once August ends, I’m swapping my tank tops for flannels, drinking pumpkin spice lattes, and rewatching <em>Over the Garden Wall</em> again. And with summer ending, school is starting—a great time to save on a bunch of tech stuff with all the back-to-school sales. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3877/">Take this student laptop for instance. Normally priced at $1,400, this has dropped by 81%. That brings it under $300 to just $260 for a limited time.</a></p>
<p><strong>This student-ready laptop is working with a powerful Intel N150 processor with an integrated graphics card</strong>. This thing won’t be playing <em>Elden Ring: Nightreign</em> with ultra-high settings or anything, but it’s perfectly capable of taking care of basic everyday task a student might need. Things like browsing the web, sending emails, drafting up essays, or building slideshows will be easy-peasy. It comes pre-installed with Window 11 Home.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3877/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>
<p>The laptop’s got 4GB of RAM with 128GB of internal storage. However, it does come with <strong>an extra 128GB in the form of a microSDXC card</strong> generously included. That’s 256GB of workable space.</p>

<h2>Microsoft Office 365 Included</h2>
<p>You also get a full year subscription to <a href="https://gizmodo.com/download/microsoft-365">Microsoft 365</a>. That includes access to Word, PowerPoint, Excel, and more. Plus with OneDrive, you can get even more storage on the cloud which you’ll be able to access anywhere from your other devices. Forgot to submit your paper, but you’re sitting in class with your laptop back in the dorm? Not a problem. Just pull it up on your phone and send it away.</p>
<p>The anti-glare display stretches across at 14 inches and is capable of a resolution of 1366 x 768 pixels. You can expand onto a second monitor over either USB-C or HDMI which can support resolutions of up to 4K at 60Hz. In addition to those ports, you get two USB-A ports and an audio jack.</p>



<p>Collaboration is easy with the built-in mic and HD 720p web camera which can record crisp and clear videos.</p>
<p>With a long battery life of up to 11 hours on a single charge, you can keep it running all day. You won’t need to bring your charger with your when taking your laptop out to all your classes for the day.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3877/">For a limited time, you can save 81% on the HP 14 student laptop</a>. The price is down to just $260 for back-to-school season and it even comes with a year of Microsoft Office 365.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/apple-changes-strategy-to-boost-sales-slashing-2025-ipads-to-a-new-record-low-price-2000622668</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/apple-changes-strategy-to-boost-sales-slashing-2025-ipads-to-a-new-record-low-price.1287330/</guid>

              <p>Apple does not usually opt for leaving things at full price – basically as though they’re afraid to give discounts. It’s the brand image: high-end gear, high-end prices. Which is why this Amazon deal feels like a surprise: It apparently chose to do things its own way, <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3886/">and it’s discounting the 2025 iPad 11-inch (Wi-Fi, 128GB) to a record-low $299 instead of $349</a>. So if you’ve ever thought that Apple deals don’t exist, well… here’s the proof that sometimes lightning does strike. The iPad itself? It’s rocking a <strong>near-perfect 4.8/5 rating</strong> from thousands of customers.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3886/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Powerful and Affordable Tablet</h2>
<p>This iPad driven by Apple’s A16 chip which is the same fast silicon you usually only see putting iPhones into hyperdrive. Plus, you get 128GB of storage which is perfect for someone who requires space for apps and plenty of files. Add in all-day battery life, and you have a tablet you can easily carry around without concern for where the next power outlet will be.</p>
<p>Apple has put an 11‑inch Liquid Retina display in this iPad which is bright, clear and just nice to look at. Movies are colorful, games come alive on the screen, and sure—if you’re a designer or artist—the detail is great. Plus, the True Tone feature means the display adjusts to the lighting around you, so your eyes don’t feel fried after hours of use.</p>



<p>Now, let’s not forget the cameras: The front has a 12MP camera that’s perfect for FaceTime calls, online classes or Zoom meetings. Throw in Apple’s Center Stage technology and you are still well-framed on camera even when you move a little as you talk. The rear also has a 12MP camera which is handy for document scanning, taking quick shots, or even taking decent-quality video if your phone is out of reach.</p>
<p>With Wi‑Fi 6, uploads and downloads feel way faster and streaming is smoother. No dropped connections when you’re bingeing or working in the cloud. Apple also dumped the old Lightning port and replaced it with USB‑C which is a huge win. That means faster charging, quicker file transfers, and easy pairing with third‑party accessories.</p>
<p>Here’s the thing: this isn’t some stripped-down iPad that only lives to tantalize people into buying it. It’s the full 2025 model, with iPadOS preloaded and ready to go, and that’s where things come together. iPadOS has been optimized to really make the most of Apple’s processor, so multitasking is a joy, split‑screen is second nature, and you can actually do actual work on it.</p>
<p>So, let’s be real. The new iPad 11 is $299, its lowest price ever, and it just so happens to be one of the highest-rated tablets on the site. This is a tough bargain to beat if you’re looking for something that can do work, school, and entertainment in one fashionable package. Just hurry up—because with prices like these, stock never lasts long.</p>

              <p>Nintendo is adding a welcome fifth game to its grown up Mature section of the Nintendo Switch Online on September 4, with the arrival of 1998’s <em>Forsaken 64</em>. The six-degrees shooter is a total classic, and a superb addition to the top-tier version of Nintendo’s subscription service–although you’ll be hard-pressed to work out why it’s still considered an M.</p> <p>In the mid-90s, with the arrival of 3D graphics cards, developers were suddenly handed a whole other axis in which to explore. The stand-out example of this new-found freedom was 1995’s&nbsp;<em>Descent</em>, known as a “six degrees of freedom” game, where you controlled a floating ship that could orientate itself however it wished in 3D spaces. That shooter was created by Parallax Software, a name you might not recognize until I tell you the studio split in two, one half becoming Volition. (The other half became Outrage Entertainment which developed the incredible <em>Descent 3</em>.) So, the developer best known for <em>Saints Row</em> and&nbsp;<em>Red Faction</em> essentially launched a whole new genre, and it was into this that publisher Acclaim Entertainment released <em>Forsaken</em> in 1998.</p> <p>OK, that’s perhaps a somewhat generous way of observing just how derivative Probe Entertainment’s <em>Forsaken</em> was of&nbsp;<em>Descent</em> and its 1996 sequel, but it remains the case that&nbsp;<em>Forsaken</em> was outstanding in its own right. While wantonly lifting weapon types, power-ups and indeed the entire concept of flying a ship through 3D tunnels from its–uh–inspiration, the game became a pioneer of the growing 3D graphics market, and a solid six-degrees shooter in its own right.</p>

  <p>The N64 version of&nbsp;<em>Forsaken</em> came out just a week later, despite being partly developed by a different Acclaim studio, Iguana UK, and even having its own unique version of the storyline. The PC and PlayStation version of the game had you playing as a nefarious rogue attempting to plunder a nuclear-destroyed Earth for its treasures as a get-rich scheme, while <em>Forsaken 64</em> took a more noble interpretation, casting you as someone trying to take down those looters. It plays out the same, but Nintendo players had the moral highground.</p> <p>It’s obviously this version that’s due to arrive on the Nintendo Switch Online subscription service September 4, as part of its higher tier “Expansion Pack.” Except, for reasons that aren’t immediately clear,&nbsp;<em>Forsaken 64</em> is to be part of the separate <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/en-gb/Games/Nintendo-Switch-download-software/Nintendo-64-Nintendo-Classics-Mature-2592474.html">Nintendo 64 – Nintendo Classics: Mature</a> app. That currently hosts&nbsp;<em>Perfect Dark</em>,&nbsp;<em>Turok: Dinosaur Hunter</em>,&nbsp;<em>Turok 2: Seeds of Evil</em> and&nbsp;<em>Shadow Man</em>, all of which were originally released with an M rating in the ’90s. However,&nbsp;<em>Forsaken 64</em>‘s rating is a bit more confusing. The game was released with an M rating in the US, both on the box and the cartridge, <a href="https://www.esrb.org/ratings/3485/forsaken-n64/">but despite the ESRB then and now rate the game as a T</a>. There’s some speculation this might be because the game featured a cheat where pressing Z, Down, C-Up, C-Left, C-Left, C-Left, C-Left, C-Down on the Start screen would unlock a Gore Mode, which would easily bump the game up from T to M in those days. If that cheat has been preserved for this release, then Nintendo presumably erred on the side of caution. Although of course this is all made a nonsense given&nbsp;<em>Golden Eye 64</em> remains a T and in the main app! And it all looks so gorgeously innocent and mild some three decades later.</p> <p>This release will support all the original 4-player multiplayer modes, which are <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hCerd9OfTLY">still super-satisfying today</a>. The only real challenge this faces is being added on the same day&nbsp;<em>Hollow Knight: Silksong</em> comes out.</p>
