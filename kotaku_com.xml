I know I struggled at first trying to understand what was different or better. Luckily, it’s easier than you think! Let’s go over Alpha, Beta, and the new Gamma armors.</p><h2 id="h254496"><a id=""></a>Alpha vs Beta Armor</h2><p>Aside from a handful of armor sets, most have an Alpha set and a Beta set. Discerning the differences between the two can be hard at first glance. Although they have slightly altered colors, that doesn’t matter as you can customize your armor pigments. They even share the same defense and resistance values.</p><p>Skills and slots are where the armor types differ the most. <strong>Alpha armor will give you more preset equipment skills, while Beta armor will instead give you extra and/or higher-level Decoration slots.</strong> Beta pieces are the preferred option for creating a custom build. If you don’t have any worthwhile decoration pieces for your proposed build or simply don’t enjoy going super in-depth with these mechanics, sticking with Alpha can be a viable option. As an example, let’s compare the same Rey Dau armor piece across both variants:</p><ul data-type="List" data-style="Bullet"><li><strong>Rey Sandgreaves Alpha:</strong> Provides a single level-three Decoration slot and both Latent Power and Maximum Might as level-one skills</li><li><strong>Rey Sandgreaves Beta:</strong> Provides a single level-three Decoration slot, two level-one Decoration slots, and the Latent Power skill at level-one</li></ul><p>You’ll receive a different Group Skill depending on which set you use. Rey Dau Alpha Armor has the <em>Inspiration</em> Group Skill, while the Beta Armor has the <em>Resuscitate</em> Group Skill. Both of these do have the same Armor Set Bonus Skill with <em>Rey Dau’s Voltage</em>.</p><h2 id="h254497"><a id=""></a>Is Gamma Armor Better?</h2><figure id="" data-id="817ca5fd2a9b4f48309f1027a69c2432" data-recommend-id="image://817ca5fd2a9b4f48309f1027a69c2432" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The Forge/Upgrade Armor screen, showing a hunter in Rey Dau Gamma armor and highlighting the Rey Sandgreaves Gamma piece." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="The Forge/Upgrade Armor screen, showing a hunter in Rey Dau Gamma armor and highlighting the Rey Sandgreaves Gamma piece." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Capcom / Samuel Moreno / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="817ca5fd2a9b4f48309f1027a69c2432" data-recommend-id="image://817ca5fd2a9b4f48309f1027a69c2432" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The Forge/Upgrade Armor screen, showing a hunter in Rey Dau Gamma armor and highlighting the Rey Sandgreaves Gamma piece." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Depending on the monster, you might have more armor options than just Alpha or Beta. Arch-Tempered monsters, for example, can reward you with a unique material to forge Gamma Armor. The only example of this so far is <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/monster-hunter-wilds-mh-mon-hun-arch-tempered-rey-dau-1851782762&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/monster-hunter-wilds-mh-mon-hun-arch-tempered-rey-dau-1851782762">Arch-Tempered Rey Dau</a></span>, so we’ll be using that monster’s set to estimate what’s different.</p><p><strong>Read More:</strong> <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/monster-hunter-wilds-mh-mon-hun-arch-tempered-rey-dau-1851782762&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/monster-hunter-wilds-mh-mon-hun-arch-tempered-rey-dau-1851782762"><em>Monster Hunter Wilds</em>’ Electric Wyvern Is Harder To Beat IN Its New Form, But It Can Be Done</a></span></p><p><strong>Gamma Armor can best be described as a set that stands out with higher defense values, higher-level equipment skills, and a brand-new Group Skill.</strong> Let’s go over how it changes the same leg piece that we compared before:</p><ul data-type="List" data-style="Bullet"><li><strong>Rey Sandgreaves Gamma:</strong> Provides eight more defense, a single level-three Decoration slot, the Stun Resistance skill at level three, and the Stamina Surge skill at level two.</li></ul><p>It seem like Beta Armor is still the best for personal builds. If you love to get into the nitty-gritty of customizing decoration slots, I can’t argue with that. However, I will point out that the entire Rey Dau Gamma Armor set still has the same equipment skills as the prior versions. They even match the highest levels or exceed them from either set. The only difference is that they’re spread out differently among the five pieces.</p><p>Even though the enhanced defense and skills are great, one of Gamma Armor’s will always give you more options. Pairing pieces from Alpha and Beta sets can feel pretty monotonous since they share the same equipment skills. Gamma Armor genuinely feels different due to the mixed skill placements, allowing for more variance with entirely separate pieces or even some from the beta set. I know I’ve had a lot of fun running a mix of Gamma and Beta Rey Dau armor.</p><p>It all depends on how you like to play at the end of the day. Some hunters like using precise skills, and others just like seeing big damage numbers. Choose the pieces that fit you best and have some fun!</p><p>.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://kotaku.com/monster-hunter-wilds-mhw-armor-alpha-beta-gamma-arch-1851785351]]></content:encoded>

It is a Game Boy Advance game based on a kids’ cartoon. Of <em>course</em>, it has some 2D platforming in it! That was the law back then.

It released in June to positive reviews, with critics praising it for wedding interesting character interactions to the usual management sim churn. Now it’s getting flamed for incorporating AI slop.

With various parts of the game becoming suspect, developer 11 Bit Studios posted a response on June 30 to try to clarify the situation. </p><p>“During production, an AI-generated text for a graphic asset, which was meant as a piece of background texture, was used by one of our graphical designers as a placeholder,” the company <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://bsky.app/profile/11bitstudios.bsky.social/post/3lstiwaoxcc2i&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://bsky.app/profile/11bitstudios.bsky.social/post/3lstiwaoxcc2i" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">wrote</a></span>. “This was never intended to be a part of the final release. Unfortunately, due to an internal oversight, this single placeholder text was mistakenly left in the game.” 11 Bit Studios said it conducted a thorough review and found no other incidents. Its defense for the movie translations, meanwhile, was that it planned to replace them with authored ones after launch, but didn’t have time beforehand and didn’t want to deprive non-English speakers of helpful context.</p><p>“Those few external movies are approx. 10k words out of 3.4 million across all languages in the game, or just 0.3 percent of the overall text,” the studio wrote. But despite being “committed to transparency in how we make our games,” 11 Bit Studios has not yet responded to requests for comment from <em>Kotaku</em> or others that elaborate on the company’s actual stance regarding generative AI tools. Are they permitted to help create in-game assets or text? What makes something “meaningful, handcrafted storytelling” if even just a few of those elements were offloaded to AI, whether in the brainstorming process or the final version of the game?</p><p>“The use cases, admittedly very transparently laid out here, have been done without genAI for decades,” wrote <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.patreon.com/aurahack&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.patreon.com/aurahack" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">artist and illustrator aurahack</a></span> <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://bsky.app/profile/aurahack.ca/post/3lstmis6chs2x&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://bsky.app/profile/aurahack.ca/post/3lstmis6chs2x" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">on Bluesky</a></span>. “This all reads a lot like ‘we’re sorry we got caught’ because there’s no recognition here of why this poses any kind of problem ethically or creatively. 0.3 percent is not a lot but it’s more than enough to cast a shadow over the rest of your work!

Let’s get cookin’.</p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="197565" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="Nintendo Switch 2 Could Launch With Almost No Reviews" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="122" data-playlist="197565,197567,195670" data-current="197565"><div><p>Nintendo Switch 2 Could Launch With Almost No Reviews</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197565/197565_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197565/197565_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197565/197565_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/23089.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><h2 id="h144629"><a id=""></a>Essential recipes in <em>The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild</em></h2><p>The recipes listed below ensure you get the very best version of a meal, but you can often choose to use fewer ingredients to get similar but weaker dishes.</p><p>For instance, you can cook five Hearty Durians to net you full heart recovery and 20 additional temporary yellow hearts. However, if you opt to use only one Hearty Durian instead, you’ll still get the full heart recovery, but you’ll only get four temporary yellow hearts. Meanwhile, cooking up five Endura Carrots can provide you with full stamina wheel recovery and two temporary yellow stamina wheels, while cooking a single Endura Carrot will only provide the full stamina wheel recovery.</p><p>So, as you might suspect by reading that, there are a hell of a lot of variations you can toy around with.

Whether it’s a Bone Pile or a monster’s body, pressing Circle/B will have your hunter lean over to get an item.</p><p><strong><em>Monster Hunter Wilds</em> has more controls than your controller has buttons</strong></p><p>You don’t have to keep monotonously pressing the button for this interaction. <strong>Keep holding down the gather button to make your hunter continue collecting until there is nothing left.</strong> You’re not saving much time, but it feels better than pressing the button three to four times.</p><h2 id="h37196"><a id="3"></a>Slingers can still be shot with weapons</h2><figure id="" data-id="3649044b9c7c47edbb2680efb04e5f9a" data-recommend-id="image://3649044b9c7c47edbb2680efb04e5f9a" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A Gypceros is hit by a slinger from a Sword and Shield-wearing Hunter." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A Gypceros is hit by a slinger from a Sword and Shield-wearing Hunter." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Capcom / Samuel Moreno / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="3649044b9c7c47edbb2680efb04e5f9a" data-recommend-id="image://3649044b9c7c47edbb2680efb04e5f9a" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A Gypceros is hit by a slinger from a Sword and Shield-wearing Hunter." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Your slinger is one of the most useful tools in <em>Monster Hunter Wilds</em>, allowing you to interact with the environment and attack enemies with different types of ammo. One problem with this is that controls get switched around once your weapons are equipped. That’s not to say you can’t use both!</p><p><strong>If you hold down L1 while holding a weapon, you can push in the left stick to shoot your slinger.</strong> The one drawback is that heavy ammo, such as Heavy Slicing Pods, can’t be used with most weapons equipped. Only the Sword and Shield can freely use any Slinger ammo type.</p><h2 id="h37197"><a id="4"></a>There is a separate Slinger item bar</h2><figure id="" data-id="97f95cc0c52b88d6daf06004fad053ef" data-recommend-id="image://97f95cc0c52b88d6daf06004fad053ef" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The hunter charges toward a Gypceros with the Slinger item bar in the bottom right corner." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="The hunter charges toward a Gypceros with the Slinger item bar in the bottom right corner." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Capcom / Samuel Moreno / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="97f95cc0c52b88d6daf06004fad053ef" data-recommend-id="image://97f95cc0c52b88d6daf06004fad053ef" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The hunter charges toward a Gypceros with the Slinger item bar in the bottom right corner." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Next up, you guessed it, is another shortcut for your Slinger. This one also goes hand-in-hand with the previous shortcut. Since all the craftable Slinger ammo takes spots in your inventory, you might think that you can only equip them from that menu. Fortunately, there is a more practical option.</p><p><strong>While holding down L1/LB, you can press L2/LT to bring up an item bar list limited to Slinger-related items from your inventory.</strong> I’ve found this to be a huge time-saver in contrast to swiping through everything I’m carrying. I do want to emphasize that it will only include items from your inventory. Any you pick up from the environment or off of monsters will not be included in this tiny item bar.</p><h2 id="h37198"><a id="5"></a>You can gather some resources without looking at them</h2><figure id="" data-id="86729ff2c337fe1814788d25c9ed869d" data-recommend-id="image://86729ff2c337fe1814788d25c9ed869d" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="In a corner of Wyveria, a hunter highlights different items in their area." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="In a corner of Wyveria, a hunter highlights different items in their area." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Capcom / Samuel Moreno / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="86729ff2c337fe1814788d25c9ed869d" data-recommend-id="image://86729ff2c337fe1814788d25c9ed869d" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="In a corner of Wyveria, a hunter highlights different items in their area." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Each area in the game is home to numerous materials. Gathering these are vital for crafting new items, forging new gear, and even finding rare items to trade for. None of that changes how tedious or occasionally inconvenient the process can be. Thankfully, there is a feature mentioned early on that could be a big help.</p><p>Holding down L2/LT will bring up a list on the left side of the screen of interactable items within your slinger’s range. You’ll then be able to do the following:</p><ul data-type="List" data-style="Bullet"><li>Pressing up or down on the d-pad will cycle through this list</li><li>Pressing left or right on the d-pad will cycle through this list and point your camera towards it.

Thankfully, there is a quick-select option.</p><p><strong>The trick to quickly select your secondary Mantle is to hold L1/LB and then press R2/RT.</strong> Your hunter will immediately equip it, even when a weapon is equipped. Using this shortcut again will have them remove the mantle.

Why only for Canada and not the rest of North America remains to be seen. Nintendo went out of its way to stress that the Switch 2, currently $450, will not see its price go up. However, amiibo and Switch Online memberships will be included in the pricing changes.
