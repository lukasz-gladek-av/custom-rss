              <p>The never-ending mission to port <a href="https://kotaku.com/its-2021-and-bethesda-has-announced-another-skyrim-port-1847521204"><em>The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim</em> to every possible platform continues</a>. This time, Bethesda has announced that the popular open-world RPG is getting a Switch 2 release. And you don’t have to wait long, as this new port of <em>Skyrim</em> is available now, and is free for previous owners of the game’s Anniversary Edition on Switch.</p> <p>On December 9, Bethesda released a trailer for the Nintendo Switch 2 edition of its <a href="https://kotaku.com/a-rogue-bee-kept-breaking-skyrims-iconic-cart-intro-1847504734">classic 2011 RPG, <em>Skyrim</em></a>. And yup, that sure looks like <em>The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim</em>, a game that feels like it has always been a part of my life and which is visually aging worse than I expected.</p>

  <p>The Switch 2 version of <em>Skyrim: Anniversary Edition</em> will cost you $60. If you already own the original Switch version of <em>Skyrim Anniversary Edition</em>, you can download the Switch 2 version for free. If instead you own the older, non-<em>Anniversary Edition</em> version of <em>Skyrim</em> on Switch (yes, there are multiple versions of the game on most platforms now), you’ll need to pay $20 to upgrade.</p>

 <p>So what do you get in this new version of <em>Skyrim</em> on Switch 2?<a href="https://bethesda.net/en/article/fGtFCgI7J9FL3l6oi9j3B/the-elder-scrolls-v-skyrim-anniversary-edition-out-now-on-nintendo-switch-2"> Well, Bethesda claims</a> that its popular RPG loads faster and has better performance on Nintendo’s new console when compared to how it ran on the OG Switch. It also boasts enhanced resolution and DLSS anti-aliasing. And yes, it supports Switch 2 mouse controls, motion controls, and Amiibo, and features the old <em>Legend of Zelda</em> exclusive cosmetic DLC seen in the old Switch port.</p> <p>Did the world need yet another way to play <em>Skyrim</em> in 2025? Probably not. But I bet this is going to sell really well, and I can’t wait to write about Skyr<em>i</em>m being ported to the PlayStation 6 in a few years. Meanwhile, we’ll still get to play <em>The </em><em>Elder Scrolls 6…</em>eventually.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/anker-is-clearly-taking-no-margin-on-its-nano-power-bank-as-it-returns-at-its-lowest-price-for-the-holidays-2000649289</link>
            <guid>1377229</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Black Friday and Cyber Monday are officially behind us. It was a week-long celebration of discounts and offers across every category you could possibly think of. Missed grabbing something? Don’t worry. There are new deals for holidays.</p>
<p>Apple users still looking to treat themselves to a reliable power solution without the typical cable mess should consider grabbing the ultra-slim. 5,000mAh Anker Nano power bank. I<a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6310/">t usually retails for $55, but thanks to Amazon holiday deal, you can snap it up for just $41 right now, but only if you act fast.</a> The discount applies to all color options, so you can pick the one that complements your phone. Got an iPhone 16 in the stunning Desert Titanium? Go for the golden or the classic black version. Have an all-black model? Add some pop of color to it with the white or green power bank! Be sure to nab the deal quick, as these leftover discounts expire soon. We’re not expecting these to last more than a few more hours.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6310/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Attaches to Your Phone, Plus Supports Wired Charging</h2>
<p>It’s (mainly) a wireless power bank, featuring an ultra-slim design. At just 0.3 inches thin, it supports Qi2 certification and snaps at the back of your phone to deliver power on the go. Its 15W output is enough to juice your device up without waiting too long. You can expect an iPhone 16 Pro to go from 0 to 25% in just over 40 minutes. We won’t exactly label it as “ultra-fast”, but considering how it becomes a part of your phone and doesn’t make you feel like you’re carrying an extra accessory when out and about, it’s not too bad. The bulky versions offering better speeds are heavier and a bit inconvenient to carry around, so if ease of use and portability are what you’re after, it’s worth it.</p>
<p>Charging may stop automatically when your phone hits 80%, to preserve the battery and prevent overheating. Once your device cools down, the power bank gets back to work. To get you the best of both worlds, it also supports USB-C fast charging, which can get an iPhone 17 from 0 to 25% in 35 minutes. Recharging the power bank itself won’t take forever either. It’s capable of hitting 100% in just under two hours.</p>



<p>Reliability comes from graphene cooling, dual NTC chips, and smart heat control that Anker has packed it with. It says under 104°F, which is 14 degrees cooler than the industry standard for safer charging. Compatibility-wise, it plays nicely with iPhone Series 12 through 17. It won’t work with an iPhone 16e or iPhone SE Series, though. Best of all, you can even top your AirPods using the charger; great for non-stop jamming on the road. The box comes with the power bank itself, USB-C to USB-C charging cable, welcome guide, and a 24-month warranty for some extra peace of mind.</p>
<p>All in all, if you’ve been looking for a reliable, fuss-free charging solution that’s super easy to carry around, this Anker Nano power bank offers all that and more. It becomes a part of your phone to provide it the power it needs, plus supports wired charging for when you want to prioritize speeds. This deal brings its price down to just $41, but it expires soon. It was a part of the Amazon’s holiday deals, the discount won’t be around for long either. Act fast before that happens!</p>

              <p>With there being little sign of the&nbsp;<a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-tcg-cards-available-journey-together-stock-1851772771"><em>Pokémon TCG&nbsp;</em>bubble</a> bursting any time soon, and many <em>Pokémon </em> cards literally worth more than their weight in gold, it’s becoming all too normal to hear stories of thieves breaking into stores and stealing the shiny cardboard. A particularly audacious example happened in California this weekend, where around $100,000 worth of cards were stolen by a masked gang in a matter of minutes—a gang who could well be responsible for a number of other similar crimes.</p> <p>As reported by local LA station <a href="https://ktla.com/news/local-news/burglars-ransack-burbank-card-shop-steal-100000-worth-of-rare-trading-cards/"><em>KTLA 5</em></a>&nbsp;(thanks&nbsp;<a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/pokmon-thieves-steal-cards-worth-100000-in-latest-californian-store-heist"><em>IGN</em></a>), a group of burglars were filmed on CCTV breaking into the Burbank card shop and making off with armfuls of <em>Pokémon&nbsp;</em>cards. The implication from store owner Kiet Nguyen’s description of the footage is that the team seem very experienced, getting in and out of the store in just a couple of minutes, seemingly knowing exactly what they wanted to take.</p>

 <p>“They tip over and smash a glass display case to grab its contents,” Nguyen told <em>KTLA</em>. “Moments later, they’re seen carrying three large bags filled with stolen goods to an awaiting getaway car. The vast majority, they were targeting <em>Pokémon</em> cards. They inadvertently took some lock boxes from the back that also had [rare] sports cards.”</p>

 <p><em>KTLA</em> goes on to report that the police suspect this particular gang of three could be responsible for a number of similar card shop break-ins around Southern California, not least because this particular burglary seemed so practiced.</p> <p>It’s not an exaggeration about the price of gold thing, by the way. I just looked it up; the average <em>Pokémon </em>card weighs just under two grams, and the same weight in gold is currently worth around $270. The Mega Charizard X ex SIR in <a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-tcg-phantasmal-flames-charizard-chase-card-2000645074">the current Phantasmal Flames set</a> is currently selling for $600, while new sealed product sells on resale markets for at least twice its MSRP. Meanwhile, a sealed booster box of 2021’s Evolving Skies currently sells for $2,350, some&nbsp;<em>eighteen</em> times the original store price.</p>

 <p>This is not only making <em>Pokémon</em> cards close to impossible for regular fans to buy or even find on sale, but also making the product increasingly high-risk for stores given the suddenly ballooning value of their stocks. Nguyen had thought his Burbank store to be well protected in a safe area, saying that he believed, with his multiple layers of security, “the deterrents were good enough.” Sadly not.</p> <p>Clearly, given the incentives and ease with which stolen sealed product and non-graded cards can be resold, breaking into a card shop is now a more lucrative crime than breaking into a jewelry store, with less protection likely to be in place, but a far easier time grabbing the equally valuable loot.</p>

Well, if you play </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/marvel-rivals-overwatch-2-vendetta-magik-rip-off-react-2000646220"><i><span>Overwatch 2</span></i></a><span>, you’re probably about to hear it a whole lot more, as the game is adding a “6-7” emote to the hero shooter as it continues to chase </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/fortnite-carter-wu-homer-simpson-nipples-skins-shirtless-2000650650"><i><span>Fortnite</span></i><span>’s</span></a><span> pop culture conglomerate status.</span></p> <p><span>The </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/6-7_(meme)"><span>“6-7” meme</span></a><span> is tough to describe because the joke is that it doesn’t really mean anything. It started as a repeated phrase in video edits about tall basketball players, then became associated with a pseudo-shrugging motion after a video of a kid saying it </span><a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/style/trends/2025/10/21/six-seven-meme-gen-alpha/"><span>while doing one went viral</span></a><span>. It is functionally meaningless; kids are just saying it. And now, Soldier: 76 will be saying it too in </span><i><span>Overwatch 2 </span></i><span>matches starting later today.</span></p>

 <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">To celebrate the meme officially dissolving into nothingness, let’s see your best 6️⃣7️⃣ clips when the emote drops tomorrow! <a href="https://t.co/di3L8uxh17">pic.twitter.com/di3L8uxh17</a></p> <p>— Overwatch (@PlayOverwatch) <a href="https://twitter.com/PlayOverwatch/status/1998169279795974371?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 8, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <p><span>I am a </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/overwatch-2-pride-month-parade-soldier-76-vincent-skin-1851785385"><span>Soldier: 76 main</span></a><span>, and seeing my grumpy gay grandpa performing memes in an obvious play for memetic virality from Blizzard is such a bummer. </span><i><span>Overwatch 2</span></i><span> keeps moving away from its own world in favor of using collaboration skins to chase the kind of crossover slop </span><i><span>Fortnite </span></i><span>has long been associated with, and while this addition isn’t a reference to another franchise, it is one of the most overt nods the game has ever made to a specific pop culture fad, and if Soldier actually says “6-7” when he uses the emote, as is implied in this video, it’s something that players can’t really ignore because players are absolutely going to spam this shit in the spawn room.</span></p> <p><span>I wish I didn’t have to dunk on </span><i><span>Overwatch 2 </span></i><span>this much because I do think the game is in the best state it’s been in since the sequel’s fumbled launch in 2022. Blizzard has reinvigorated the shooter with its build-based Stadium mode, the Perks system that lets you customize your playstyle on the fly, and some really interesting new heroes like </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/overwatch-2-vendetta-reveal-trailer-cinematic-video-2000644926"><span>Vendetta</span></a><span> and Wuyang, but man, I don’t think I’ll ever get over the team </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/overwatch-2-story-pve-canceled-campaign-null-sector-2000641177"><span>sanding away </span><i><span>Overwatch</span></i><span>’s world</span></a><span> in favor of </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/overwatch-2-persona-5-ryuji-junkrat-genji-futaba-dva-2000626027"><span>endless crossovers</span></a><span>, and now memes.
