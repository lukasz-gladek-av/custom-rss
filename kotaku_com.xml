After tons of pre-launch red flags, the techno thriller shooter is now out in the wild and suffering all the day-one woes: bugs, poor optimization on PC, and underlying gameplay that early players say is barely passable for a big release in 2025. “Build A Rocket Boy, I genuinely wanted you to pull this off,” wrote one Steam user. “Sadly, this game plays like crap.”</p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="195928" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="How Alan Wake 2 Builds Upon The 'Remedy-Verse'" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="190" data-playlist="195928,197559,195922" data-current="195928"><div><p>How Alan Wake 2 Builds Upon The 'Remedy-Verse'</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195928/195928_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195928/195928_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195928/195928_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195928/195928_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/21446.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p> With fewer than 1,000 reviews on Steam and only 40 percent of them positive, <em>MindsEye</em>,<em>&nbsp;</em>is already facing an uphill battle as developers race to push out patches on console and PC that might address some of the biggest issues.

The game has peaked at around 3,000 concurrent on Steam so far, which is where <em>Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League</em> was less than a month after launch. “I refuse to believe this game went through actual playtesting,” wrote another Steam user. “It’s not possible.”</p><p><em>MindsEye</em> follows ex-soldier Jacob Diaz, a man with a mysterious implant who’s losing his mind. He heads to the Vegas-inspired near-future city of Redrock to unravel what’s happening to him and engage in all sorts of intrigue, action, and open-world driving. Despite obvious comparisons to <em>Grand Theft Auto</em>, given the large map and third-person view, its more akin to a <em>Mafia</em> game in that if you go off the beaten path you will not actually encounter all that much. It’s a big world but an empty one, propelled by a cutscene-heavy story campaign that takes up to 15 hours. </p><p>Many were hoping <em>MindsEye</em> would end up being an AA shooter that punched above its weight. In reality, players feel like it was rushed out.

Meanwhile Benzies, the game’s director, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/mindseye-gta-leslie-benzies-ugc-roblox-minecraft-1851783117&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/mindseye-gta-leslie-benzies-ugc-roblox-minecraft-1851783117">gave an interview</a></span> where he talked about a 10 year plan revolving around user-created content that would make <em>MindsEye </em>just the first piece of a sprawling, hyper-realistic <em>Roblox</em>-like community.<br></p><p>That boardroom-tested marketing pitch seems more imperiled then ever, even if some players maintain that <em>MindsEye</em> itself could be turned into a somewhat decent game with enough post-launch patches. Now all eyes are on update 3, which the developers have promised to provide more details about soon. “Our engineering team are working around the clock to improve performance on mainstream hardware as well as consoles by integrating the performance improvements in Unreal Engine V5.6,” <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/MindsEyeGame/comments/1l8acbd/update_on_performance/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/MindsEyeGame/comments/1l8acbd/update_on_performance/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">a message</a></span> on the subreddit reads. “We will provide patch 3 update timing, including these improvements, within the next 24 hours.”<br></p><p>Some  in the game’s Discord don’t seem entirely convinced. “Everyone I know on console refunded. They will regret not waiting for update 3!” wrote one. Although not all are so pessimistic. Says another, “Update 3 is COMING at a rapid rate, the haters are scared of <em>GTA</em> getting competition again.<em> Mindseye</em> will Succeed where<em> Saints Row </em>failed.” </p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
