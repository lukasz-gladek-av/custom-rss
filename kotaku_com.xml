Usually, in games featuring the famous turtle crimefighters, you punch and kick a ton of goons in real-time, either alone or with some buddies. That’s not the case in <em>TMNT: Tactical Takedown,</em> which is instead a turn-based tactics game. Thankfully, the shift to turn-based mostly works for the Turtles, even if the game is a bit barebones. </p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="197562" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="THPS 3+4 Does Away With The OG 4's Career Mode, Here's Why" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="118" data-playlist="197562,196394,196599" data-current="197562"><div><p>THPS 3+4 Does Away With The OG 4's Career Mode, Here's Why</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197562/197562_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197562/197562_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197562/197562_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/23086.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>In <em>TMNT: Tactical Takedown</em>, battles play out on small maps covered in grids. Each mission features one turtle fighting his way through these maps turn-by-turn, while enemies spawn throughout, also moving on their own turns across the grid. Your goal is often to clear out the baddies while reaching the end of the level. </p><p>At first, I was worried that this tactical and slower-paced turn-based gameplay wouldn’t feel <em>TMNT</em>-enough, that it would lack the kinetic excitement of most of the <em>Ninja Turtle</em> games and shows. But, developers <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/el-paso-elsewhere-strange-scaffold-black-in-gaming-1851352903&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/el-paso-elsewhere-strange-scaffold-black-in-gaming-1851352903">Strange Scaffold</a></span> (of <em>Witch Stranding</em>, <em>E</em><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/el-paso-elsewhere-max-payne-control-creepy-ps1-review-1850871547&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/el-paso-elsewhere-max-payne-control-creepy-ps1-review-1850871547"><em>l, Paso Elsewhere</em></a></span><em>&nbsp;</em>and <em>Creepy Redneck Dinosaur Mansion 3</em> fame) did a great job infusing the strategic gameplay with flourishes and ideas that make it feel plenty exciting and fast-paced. </p><p>One significant way <em>TMNT: Tactical Takedown</em> makes the action feel exciting is ensuring that you don’t hang out in one area during missions. Instead, you are pushed forward every few turns as the levels grow ahead of you and fall behind you. For example, during one mission, I entered some subway trains and as the train started, the grid outside of the train turned red—a visual warning it was about to vanish—disappearing along with some goons. Then, once the train reached its station, and I had beaten up another dozen or so Foot Clan members, I exited before the carriage itself fell into the void, taking more baddies with it.</p><p> Having levels change every few turns means I had to keep moving forward, similar to an old-school beat ‘em up. And you can even take advantage of the levels changing by kicking back enemies into the red areas and watching them fall into nothing on your next turn. However, it’s even more fun to kick them off the edge of the maps, something I did a lot<em>. </em></p><p>Another design choice I appreciated is that most of the Turtles’ moves encourage you to be aggressive, and then reward it. A lot of times in <em>Tactical Takedown,</em> I was taking out multiple enemies in one turn by chaining attacks in satisfying ways, although given this also means the game is designed around you defeating tons of enemies quickly, it leads to some missions quickly filling up with Foot Clan soldiers who can too often overwhelm your Turtles if you make a mistake. I wonder if, for those hoping for a more arcade-like experience, <em>Tactical Takedown</em> might prove too tactically challenging. </p><p>Of course, any <em>TMNT </em>game is going to star the Turtles themselves, and this is easily the best part of the <em>Tactical Takedown.</em> The Turtles are separated for the entire game, mostly, and that’s a bit strange—sure, if you do enough cool shit you can pull off a team up move—but most of the time you are playing as each turtle separately. </p><figure id="" data-id="37e4cca189013898b38b002b5e4c30be" data-recommend-id="image://37e4cca189013898b38b002b5e4c30be" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Strange Scaffold / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="37e4cca189013898b38b002b5e4c30be" data-recommend-id="image://37e4cca189013898b38b002b5e4c30be" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>But while they don’t fight side by side throughout most of the game, they do talk to each other via cutscenes, and the writing here is excellent. I won’t spoil too much, but the conflict between the brothers is the core of the tale, and it’s shocking how invested I got in the rather simple, but well-delivered story of four mutated turtle warriors dealing with grief, loss, and trying to pick up the pieces together.</p><p>Sadly, too much of<em> TMNT: Tactical Takedown</em> feels barebones. Levels look fine, but are very simple, rarely featuring varying locations or details. The Turtles all play differently, with various moves that reflect their personality, but so many sound effects are reused. Couple that with simplistic, stiff combat animations and levels that go on for too long, and <em>Tactical Takedown</em> can often feel like a game that is trying to trick you into thinking it’s more than it is.</p><p>Still, I’m happy <em>Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Tactical Takedown</em> was made, and that I played it. It’s a unique spin on the franchise, and the turn-based combat is frenetic and fun. I also love the way the Turtles are depicted in cutscenes. It’s a shame that there’s not much else here, but what is there is good and feels like a solid foundation for future DLC or sequels that could add more. </p><p> <em>Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Tactical Takedown </em>launched on May 22 for PC. It is available now on Steam and runs great on Steam Deck. </p><p> .<br></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

One thing the Star Wars spin-off can rest assured of is that no other major video games will be releasing around it that month. </p><p>.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

A24 announced <em>Elden Ring </em>is the latest hit game slated to get a live-action adaptation, with Ex Machina and <em>Civil War</em>’s Alex Garland signed on to direct. What exactly the result will be is anyone’s guess, and fans aren’t quite sure whether to praise the sun or get ready for a flop.</p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="195502" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="The Most Sought After Elden Ring Sword Has A Storied History" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="307" data-playlist="195502,195624,196773" data-current="195502"><div><p>The Most Sought After Elden Ring Sword Has A Storied History</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195502/195502_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195502/195502_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195502/195502_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195502/195502_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/20979.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>The brutal but massively acclaimed 2022 action-RPG has sold over 30 million copies, making it a straightforward choice for Hollywood to take a shot at in terms of the financial upside. But while some game movies have recently hit big at the box office, like <em>Sonic</em>, <em>Mario</em>, and <em>Minecraft</em>, others aimed at more mature audiences—like <em>Borderlands</em>—have been epic failures. </p><p>The <em>Elden Ring</em> project doesn’t have a tentative release date yet and about the only other thing we know so far is that the production team includes some combination of: Peter Rice, Andrew Macdonald, Allon Reich, Vince Gerardis, and George R. R. Martin. That last name is important not just because he’s the author behind the <em>Game of Thrones</em>, but also because he collaborated with FromSoftware on <em>Elden Ring</em>’s story and world building. </p><p>Precisely how much he was involved remains up for debate. Martin seems happy to involve himself in any creative endeavor that will delay him from finally finishing the last two books in his<em> Song of Fire and Ice</em> fantasy series, <em>The Winds of Winter </em>and <em>A Dream of Spring</em>. <em>Elden Ring</em> fans, a famously chill bunch, aren’t sure how to feel about the whole thing. </p><p>Garland has been on a writing and directing blitz. Following his acclaimed sci-fi horror <em>Ex Machina</em> and his adaptation of the <em>Annihilation</em> books, he’s recently put out the American political horror flick <em>Civil War</em>, this year’s Iraq invasion movie <em>Warfare</em>, and a bunch of <em>28 Days Later </em>spin-offs. How would his horror chops influence <em>Elden Ring </em>on the big screen? </p><p>Given it’s an A24 production, there’s a good chance Garland and company will have a lot of latitude with the mood of an <em>Elden Ring</em> movie and how it’s shot, with more artistic license than a conventional game adaptation aimed at a mass audience might be offered. And of course there’s whatever role publisher Bandai Namco will play in all of this, as well as FromSoftware itself. Director Hidetaka Miyazaki has been integral to the studio’s unique brand of storytelling, including <em>Elden Ring</em>, but has no confirmed role in the adaptation at the moment.</p><p>You should actually watch an interview <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iJUab499PVA&amp;pp=0gcJCdgAo7VqN5tD&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iJUab499PVA&amp;pp=0gcJCdgAo7VqN5tD" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Garland did with Naughty Dog’s Neil Druckmann</a></span> if you want to get a good sense of how he thinks about storytelling in games and movies. I can imagine a very stoic, near wordless script that focuses an <em>Elden Ring</em> movie primarily on the mythology and horror of The Lands Between, which is in some ways comparable to zombie Camelot. </p><p> FromSoftware’s boss creature designs, extravagant and larger-than-life, seem like a challenging fit for a live-action production without a Disney-level budget for special effects. Then again, the team on <em>Godzilla Minus One</em> proved you don’t need tons of money to make an incredible-looking monster movie. I wonder if Guillermo del Toro was offered a shot at <em>Elden Ring</em> and passed. It certainly seems more up his alley than Garland’s. </p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
