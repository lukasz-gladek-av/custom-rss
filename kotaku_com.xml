              <p><span>The Pokémon Company seems likely t</span><span>o reveal the upcoming Generation X games in February on the series’ 30th anniversary, but if leakers have anything to say about it, Game Freak might not have much new information to give us by the time that showcase arrives. On December 24, a series of new leaks about the games, allegedly titled </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-leak-generation-10-wind-wave-galar-legends-mmo-2000635337"><i><span>Pokémon Wind </span></i><span>and </span><i><span>Wave</span></i></a><span>, began spreading online. We’ve gotten a few waves (sorry) of information since </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-wind-wave-pikachu-leak-generation-10-redesign-2000635674"><span>the massive Teraleak</span></a><span> in October, but now we know a little bit more about the games’ map, battle gimmick, and have even our first look at the new region’s professor.</span></p> <p><span>The latest info was posted on X early today by self-described <a href="https://x.com/i/status/2003786462651932797">Pokémon detective Moot Monthly</a>. All of these new images, animations, and illustrations are reportedly from this existing leak, so it’s entirely possible they aren’t indicative of the final games that will eventually ship on Switch 2. But they do give us some interesting insight into what Game Freak has been working on for the next mainline entries.&nbsp;</span></p>

Apparently, the professor will ride around in a car and appear in multiple locations in the games’ archipelago setting. Right now, all we know is that he appears to be an older man with thick eyebrows and a beard.</span></p>

 <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="de" dir="ltr">Pokémon Gen 10 leak: the new Professor (he drives around in a car!) and how the new Pokémon Centers will look <a href="https://t.co/erGuj76bUM">https://t.co/erGuj76bUM</a></p> <p>— Centro LEAKS (@CentroLeaks) <a href="https://twitter.com/CentroLeaks/status/2003838143943094555?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 24, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <p><span>Speaking of the archipelago, we also have a new illustration of the Gen X region. Its beta map shows several islands that the player will be able to explore. Early reports say they will be procedurally generated, so it’s unclear if the map is a sort of presumed “default” shape for these islands or if the terrain is what changes for each player, rather than the shape of the landmass.&nbsp;</span></p>

What we can see for now is that this phenomenon will seemingly distort a Pokémon’s physical shape and then create some kind of cloud to obscure them. Looking at what this shit does to Pikachu in the leaked animation, I’m not immediately onboard. But hey, it’s leaked in-development footage from a hack. We’ll see how it actually changes up battles when the games are eventually revealed.</span></p>

For now, </span><i><span>Pokémon Legends: Z-A</span></i><span>’s </span><i><span>Mega Dimension </span></i><span>DLC is keeping me busy, so I’m not starving for something new right now.</span></p>

              <p>It’s certainly true that&nbsp;<em>Strange Jigsaws</em> came out as long ago as August, and it’s also very much the case that the game has a blistering <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2702170/Strange_Jigsaws/">“Overwhelmingly Positive” rating on Steam</a> with a remarkable 99 percent of player reviews giving the game a thumbs-up. But somehow, this stunning follow-up to 2024’s lovely <em>20 Small Mazes</em> has not received <a href="https://www.metacritic.com/game/strange-jigsaws/">a single published review</a>, and has gone forgotten in end-of-year lists. What a peculiar situation. Let’s address that a little bit by talking about why <i>Strange Jigsaws </i>is such a wonderful game, and how it’s a brilliant choice to play during your winter holidays.</p> <p>2024’s&nbsp;<em>20 Small Mazes</em> was a free game created by FLEB that was so much more than its title suggested. I mean, it&nbsp;<em>was</em> literally 20 small mazes, but it was also <a href="https://buried-treasure.org/2024/02/20-small-mazes/">an extremely clever collection of puzzles</a>, each presented as if it were a simple maze but in actuality loaded with completely lovely ideas. It was bonkers that it was free, but perhaps it was something of a runway for <em>Strange Jigsaws</em>, a spiritual sequel that at first looks like it employs a similar conceit, but quickly reveals a whole new realm of intricacy.</p>

 <figure id="attachment_2000655426" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000655426"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000655426">© FLEB / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p>This time out, there are 50 “jigsaws” to solve, and I use quotes here because it’s so often more involved than that. As with <em>Mazes</em>, none is straightforward, each possessing a unique twist or original way of being solved. Even the main menu is part of its elaborate mystery of interconnecting elements that defy the laws of physics. Or rely on them, in one case.</p>

 <p>I love that it seems, on reflection, as if <em>20 Small Mazes</em> might have been part of this project, a deliberate effort to create expectations that&nbsp;<em>Strange Jigsaws</em> constantly defies. “Yeah, you thought this was another cute little bunch of novel ideas? Well, now figure out how this factory game spoof fits in to the creation of a lifeform you inadvertently engineered. Oh, here’s a puzzle that’s arrived from the future, locked behind a code and labelled ‘THE PAST.’ (It’s near the puzzle that’s on fire.) Once you’ve solved it, you can enter the infinite zoom!” Oh my goodness, I’m not sure gaming has offered anything else as clever as <em>Strange Jigsaws</em>‘&nbsp;infinite zoom this year.</p>

 <figure id="attachment_2000655429" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000655429"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000655429">© FLEB / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p>This is a masterful creation, and it’s rather mystifying why no one (including me!) reviewed it. It’s not too late, of course. And right now <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2702170/Strange_Jigsaws/">you can get it for yourself for just $4</a>! That’s madness. Do that, for goodness sakes. Then buy another one for a friend.</p>
