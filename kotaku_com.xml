              <p><em>Chrono Trigger</em> is very special. It’s a bold and beautiful RPG assembled by some of the best developers working in gaming at the time. Perhaps just as importantly, it holds up remarkably well for a game that <a href="https://kotaku.com/chrono-trigger-jrpg-snes-30th-anniversary-square-1851769192">released on the SNES over 30 years ago</a>. Go play it right now if you haven’t. I promise you it sill looks great, sounds amazing, and packs a neat, evocative, one-of-a-kind story into an incredibly streamlined but satisfying time-travelling structure. I mention all this because <a href="https://kotaku.com/dragon-quest-3-remake-changes-horii-gender-elon-musk-1851665687"><em>Dragon Quest</em> creator Yuji Horii</a>, who was also one of the writers on <em>Chrono Trigger</em>, is once again playing coy about Square Enix’s plans for a remake.</p> <p>“I can’t talk about that,” Horii said on the latest episode of the ‘<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nq1II1jaiuA&amp;t=6628s">KosoKoso Hōsō Kyoku</a>‘ talk show livestream (translated by&nbsp;<a href="https://automaton-media.com/en/news/chrono-triggers-original-supervisor-yuji-horii-says-i-cant-talk-about-it-dont-ask-and-ill-get-in-trouble-when-asked-about-new-developments/">Automaton</a>) when asked if <a href="https://x.com/squareenix_jp/status/1899298993613791338?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1899298993613791338%7Ctwgr%5Edfec9381ad5a12d366a05615b17599a5209267ae%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.eurogamer.net%2Fsquare-enix-celebrating-chrono-trigger-anniversary-with-new-projects-sparking-re-release-hopes">anniversary events</a> for the SNES classic might be leading up to a bigger project. He continued to say he couldn’t talk about it in a way that heavily implied there was something to talk about. “Wait, if I say that, you’ll figure it out!” he added, followed by “Don’t ask!” and “I’ll get in trouble!”</p>

 <h2>Square Enix is in the middle of a remaster frenzy</h2> <p>This might feel like a bit of smoke with no fire if not for the fact that Horii has done this before. At Napoli Comicon, the designer appeared to let slip that <em>Chrono Trigger</em> was getting a remake before following it up with “You have heard nothing.” There <a href="https://x.com/buzz_95b/status/1918366504048804155">was video</a>, and <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/dragonquest/comments/1kd11di/comment/mq7liqb/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button">first-hand accounts from attendees</a>, but it was all a bit messy to parse due to the translations and loud audience reactions. Square Enix later <a href="https://twitter.com/Genki_JPN/status/1923998070309781720?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1923998070309781720%7Ctwgr%5E96578349a12f5ffb6114b601fc5b0fd5fd94b346%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamesradar.com%2Fgames%2Frpg%2Fit-is-a-mistranslation-regarding-a-chrono-trigger-remake-says-square-enix-further-dashing-hopes-of-a-new-version-of-the-iconic-rpg-30-years-after-its-release%2F">followed up</a> to say that Horii had been “mistranslated,” which only convinced fans the remake was even more real.</p>

 <p>But while I absolutely believe at this point that Square Enix is working on something related to <em>Chrono Trigger</em>, what exactly it will be and when, if ever, it’ll see the light of day, is harder to pin down. Square Enix has released all sorts of remasters and remakes running from simple HD updates (<em>Chrono Cross</em>) to HD-2D glow-ups (<em>Dragon Quest III Remake</em>) to complete 3D overhauls (<em>Final Fantasy VII Remake</em>). There’s even Horii’s own upcoming <a href="https://kotaku.com/dragon-quest-7-remake-ps1-switch-2-graphics-chrono-trigger-2000625721"><em>Dragon Quest VII Reimagined</em></a>, which falls somewhere between those last two categories.</p>

 <p>In other words, <em>Chrono Trigger</em> could get a straightforward <em>Pixel Perfect</em>-style upgrade or a full-blown reimagining. My money’s on something simpler. Square Enix has shown a desire to remain pretty conservative when tampering with its classics, and doesn’t necessarily <a href="https://kotaku.com/square-enix-business-plan-multiplatform-1851472456">have the resources</a> to be throwing at a more ambitious remake. Then there’s the fact that things like a rumored remake of <a href="https://kotaku.com/final-fantasy-9-remake-anniversary-merch-rpg-1851773483"><em>Final Fantasy IX</em> are still MIA</a>. As it pulls from its back catalog, Square Enix seems a bit less predictable with what will come out when and in what form.</p>

 <h2>Yes,<em> Chrono Trigger</em> really is that good</h2> <p>Maybe there’s also a little bit of trepidation with trying to “improve” on what’s widely considered to be one of the all-time greats. <em>The Outer Worlds 2</em> game director Brandon Adler was recently gushing about the game with zero caveats. “Let’s just take the actual visuals and the music on that thing,” Adler said on a recent episode of <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/04fCqmmagL4Nz56PAMcvA4?"><em>My Perfect Console</em></a>. “Just aesthetically, the game is gorgeous on so many different fronts. I can still hear the music. The characters, they made such an impact, and they did such interesting things, even in terms of the actual systems behind them, like the [techniques] that were being used.”</p>

 <p>He also complimented the pacing which remains unmatched in the genre. “It doesn’t get enough credit for, although I think the real RPG heads will know this, is the pacing on it is just amazing,” he said. “It’s one of the only JRPGs I can think of where you don’t actually have to grind. You can just play through the entire experience and you don’t have to worry about that aspect of JRPGs. Which, some people like that, but also it’s a grind.”</p> <p>This is the kind of stuff people think about when they call <em>Chrono Trigger</em> <a href="https://kotaku.com/chrono-trigger-the-kotaku-review-1826393914">a “perfect” game</a>, and the kind of thing that would be easy to mess up with a remake that starts reorganizing things at a deeper level than just the look and sound. Those things are precious too, though. Trying to remake that first glimpse of the Kingdom of Zeal would be like going in decades later and trying to monkey around with <em>Laurence of Arabia</em>. Good luck! But also I would 100 percent use it as an excuse to go back and replay<em> Chrono Trigger</em> either way. Some games are too good to be remade. Others are so good that no remake could ever take anything away from them.</p>

              <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/switch-2-sale-cyber-monday-mario-kart-world-walmart-amazon-2000649232"><i><span>Mario Kart World</span></i></a> <span>got a </span><a href="https://en-americas-support.nintendo.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/68580/~/how-to-update-mario-kart-world"><span>major patch last night</span></a><span>, and most of the changes in the update are what you’d expect. There are some bug fixes, track tweaks, and some smaller stuff, like making specific items respawn faster. But on top of all this good stuff, Nintendo also did one of the most obnoxious, Nintendo-ass things it could have possibly done by making its audio settings a toggle, rather than a slider for players to adjust to their liking.</span></p> <p><span>As demonstrated by <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/kzxcellent.live/post/3m72cm4q6zk2t">this clip</a>, </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/mario-kart-world-patch-online-three-lap-2000628126"><i><span>Mario Kart World</span></i><span>’s</span></a><span> new update adds a “Music Volume” option in the racer’s settings that lets you adjust how loud the music is while you’re driving around and throwing blue shells at each other. However, the only options you have in this setting are “Normal” and “Loud.” You can’t tweak these presets at all, and most people who adjust the music volume in video games aren’t making it </span><i><span>louder</span></i><span>; they’re usually trying to balance it so they can hear audio cues, voice acting, or whatever they’re trying to hone in on.&nbsp;</span></p> <figure id="attachment_2000650068" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000650068"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000650068">© Nintendo / @kzxcellent.live on Bluesky / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p><span>Audio options can be helpful for a lot of reasons, but they are, at their core, an accessibility accommodation, and Nintendo has a history of weird oversights like this. </span><i><span>Pokémon Sword </span></i><span>and </span><i><span>Shield </span></i><span>famously locked its audio settings behind </span><a href="https://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Hi-tech_Earbuds"><span>an in-game item</span></a><span> you couldn’t get until you were hours into the game. Adding music volume settings and making it a toggle that only gets louder, rather than quieter, sounds like someone at Nintendo heard someone asking for audio options, then didn’t bother to ask why or what they should do. It’s annoying, but it’s also incredibly funny because it feels like Nintendo is so insistent that it isn’t going along with the rest of the industry that it won’t even look at other games or companies as a reference for how to handle basic quality-of-life settings.</span></p> <p><span>The full patch notes are as follows:&nbsp;</span></p> <p><strong>General</strong></p> <ul> <li>Added “Custom Items”

            <link>https://kotaku.com/amazon-strikes-google-hard-now-selling-fitbit-charge-6-at-all-time-low-after-cyber-monday-2000650049</link>
            <guid>1371505</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Amazon extended its Cyber Week deals into December with continued discounts on major brands including Fitbit, which Google acquired to strengthen its wearables lineup. The <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5847/">Fitbit Charge 6 fitness tracker dropped to $99 on Amazon, matching the Cyber Monday price and slashing $60 off the regular $159 tag</a> and this all-time low makes the Charge 6 accessible for anyone who wants detailed health tracking.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5847/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Heart Rate Accuracy</h2>
<p>The Fitbit Charge 6<strong> sends your heart rate in real time to exercise machines</strong> that can use Bluetooth which means that treadmills, ellipticals, and stationary bikes can show your actual heart rate instead of using their often-unreliable handlebar sensors. This connection is important for interval training or heart rate zone workouts where you need exact feedback to keep up the right level of intensity. Fitbit changed the heart rate sensor array on the Charge 6 to <strong>make it more accurate during high-intensity movements</strong>. This was done in response to complaints that previous models lost tracking during vigorous exercise.</p>
<p>The <strong>built-in GPS records your pace, distance, and elevation data</strong> while you run, walk, or ride your bike outside. You don’t need to bring your phone with you; the data will sync with the Fitbit app once you’re back in Bluetooth range. You can leave your phone behind while you work out and still get all the information about your route for later analysis. The GPS receiver locks onto satellites quickly, unlike older fitness trackers that sometimes took a few minutes to get a signal.</p>



<p>When you start directions on your phone, <strong>Google Maps integration shows turn-by-turn directions right on the Charge 6’s screen</strong>. This puts navigation prompts on your wrist so you can see them without taking out your phone. With Google Wallet support, you can tap to pay at checkout terminals with cards stored in your Google account. This means you don’t have to carry your wallet around when you run quick errands or go get coffee. When you play music through the app on your phone, music controls show up on the tracker’s display. This lets you control playback without having to touch your device while you work out.</p>
<p><strong>Sleep trackin</strong>g keeps track of how long you spend in light, deep, and REM sleep stages during the night. This gives you more information about the quality of your sleep than just the total hours you slept. The Sleep Score algorithm takes into account how long you slept, how restful it was, and how well it restored you to create a single number that tells you how well you actually slept. Morning readiness scores look at your recent activity, sleep, and heart rate variability to suggest whether you should work hard or take it easy during your workout today. Stress management tools check your heart rate variability and start guided breathing sessions when the tracker sees that your stress levels are too high.</p>



<p>The <strong>six-month Premium membership that comes with it</strong> gives you access to advanced analytics, guided programs, and detailed health metrics that help you see patterns in your data. Premium gives you daily readiness scores, advanced sleep analysis, and workout suggestions that are tailored to your fitness level and recent activity. You can keep using core tracking features after the trial period ends without paying for Premium, but you won’t be able to access the extra insights and guided content.</p>
<p>Depending on how often you use GPS and other power-hungry features,<strong> the battery can last up to seven days between charges</strong>. This is a huge improvement over smartwatches that need to be charged every night. When you don’t have much time, quick charging adds a full day of battery in just 12 minutes. Fitbit i<strong>ncludes both small and large bands in the box</strong>&nbsp;so the tracker can fit wrists that are 5.5 to 8.1 inches around without the need to buy extra bands.</p>
<p>The Charge 6 is now in the entry-level fitness tracker price range at $99, but it has features that are usually only found on devices that cost $150 or more. The $60 discount and six months of Premium included make this a great deal because Premium costs $10 a month on its own.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/switch-2-compatible-samsung-microsdxc-black-friday-deal-2000650000</link>
            <guid>1371457</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>There is nothing more annoying, frustrating, and heartbreaking than having to delete your old titles just to make room for new ones. We’ve all been in those situations, but there’s a simple way out. Investing in a microSD card can give your storage the boost it needs, and we just spotted a solid option going for a lot less.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5799/">The 512GB Samsung P9 Express microSD card, which is made for Nintendo Switch, is currently going at a 25% discount.</a> This brings its price down to just $75, saving you a nice $15. It’s the lowest we have seen it drop to since its release, but the offer is only around for a short time. Grab it while it’s still live, because once it’s gone, we don’t expect it to be back at this price anytime soon.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5799/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Spacious Capacity, Better Speeds</h2>
<p>Starting off with the storage; the 512GB capacity is more than enough to house all your favorite titles and other downloadable content (DLCs) that you can’t squeeze into the internal storage of your console. It’s not as massive as 1TB, sure, but unless you’re looking to store massive libraries, it’s going to be sufficient. Sequential read speeds of up to 800 MB/s make it easy to access games and get back into action (literally) up to four times faster than most other options in the same range. These speeds translate into quicker load times and much faster updates.</p>
<p>Installation couldn’t be simpler. Just turn your Nintendo Switch off, locate the kickstand on the back, and open it. Look for the dedicated slot and gently insert the card into it. Once it clicks into place, turn your console on and follow any on-screen instructions that pop up. It should be up and running within minutes!</p>



<p>The card plays nicely with Nintendo Switch 2, plus microSD UHS-I devices like computers, tablets, cameras, and select handheld consoles. It’s built to last you for years to come, thanks to its 6 layers of protection. It is waterproof (capable of withstanding up to 72 hours in seawater), temperature-proof with operating temperatures of -13 degrees Fahrenheit to 185 degrees Fahrenheit, X-Ray proof, magnetic-proof, plus drop-proof up to 16.4 feet. Even with all this, Samsung offers a limited warranty of 3 years that covers you if anything goes wrong. The card features a dynamic thermal guard that keeps it cool even during those intense sessions that demand a lot of power.

<p><span>The fireworks begin on Nov. 27 with a massive overhaul of the Crew Deck, the launch of the <em>Deep Oblivion</em> and <em>Intertwined Assault</em> events, and the debut of new dolls Leva and Lenna. <em>Deep Oblivion</em> is a two-part event, with part 2 dropping on Dec. 18 along with Robella, the third new doll. There are also huge player rewards to be found, including more than 130 pulls and over 13,000 Collapse Pieces.
