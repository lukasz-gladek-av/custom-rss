              <p>Lots of awesome games came out this year from <em>Hollow Knight: Silksong</em> to <em>Blue Prince</em> to <em>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</em>. <em>Silent Hill f</em> and <em>Borderlands 4</em> just dropped along with the 1.0 release of <em>Hades 2</em>. If you want to play all of these plus all the other cool stuff that came out in 2025&nbsp;<em>and</em> hang onto all of your other games, you may want to expand your storage. Over the past decade or longer, game file sizes have really started to balloon larger and larger. Some titles even clock in over 100GB. So get yourself a solid internal SSD like the Kingston NV3 drive. It’s available in sizes up to 4TB and is currently on sale.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4323/">Breaking down the different models and discounts, let’s start with the smallest. Kingston has 500GB option for its Gen 4×4 SSD</a>. That one normally goes for $54, but it’s now down to just $39 — saving you $15. Going up, we have the 1TB model. That’s usually $80, but the sale has it to just $58 — a savings of $22. The 2TB is $43 off, bringing it from&nbsp; $158 to just $115. Then lastly we have the massive 4TB model going for $230. That’s a $91 discount off of the starting price of $320. All discounts work out to between 27-28%.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4323/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Fast Load Times</h2>
<p>The Kingston NV3 SSD has remarkable read and write speeds, coming in at up to 6,000 MB/s for read speeds and up to 5,000 MB/s for write speeds. That means quick load times in all your games. Hope you’re good at them because you’ll have hardly any time to read those quick tips that appear while waiting for levels to load. Those speeds will also help with plenty of non-gaming tasks ranging from video editing to working with large datasets — really any kind of hardware intensive workflow.</p>
<p>Check the specs of what you’re looking to install it on. So long as your laptop, tower, or mini PC has support for PCle 4.0, you’ll be good to go.</p>



<p>If you’re not a PC gamer and are instead looking to expand to storage of your PlayStation 5, it is compatible but with a catch. You will have to separately pick up a heatsink. These little metal casings are used to help dissipate heat to prevent overheating. They’re pretty easy to install into your PS5. You can just follow any number of video tutorials on YouTube.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4323/">For a limited time, you can save up to $91 on this internal SSD from Kingston</a>. Choose between four different capacities, starting at just $39.</p>

              <p>How could a game with a name as fluffy as&nbsp;<em>PuffPals: Island Skies</em> ever do anything wrong? How could a company called Fluffnest be anything other than the cuddliest love-bunnies on the internet? It’s too implausible to even consider. Except… Launched on Kickstarter in April 2022, <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/fluffnest/puffpals-island-skies"><em>PuffPals: Island Skies</em></a> promised to bring the experience of a game like&nbsp;<em>Animal Crossing&nbsp;</em>to the PC, with the very modest goal of just $75,000. But people were excited, the project got a lot of buzz, and in the end it raised an incredible $2.6 million (kinda). Today, the website for the game is gone, backer refund requests are being ignored, and multiple lawsuits against the company behind the project have been lodged.</p> <p>Two people, David Pentland and artist usLily, started Fluffnest—also via Kickstarter—in 2020. As superbly documented by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BZjvRwjxacY">Mujin on YouTube</a> (thanks <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/life-sim/puffpals-island-skies-a-cosy-game-that-earned-usd2-5-million-on-kickstarter-has-been-slammed-with-refund-requests-after-its-website-and-online-store-disappeared/"><em>PCG</em></a>), it became an instant success, creating gorgeous plushies that developed a large fanbase, with hundreds of thousands of followers on social media, and a drop-based store that meant each plush was only available for a limited time. In 2022, the pair began the project to create a game set in the world of their plushies, an <em>Animal Crossing</em>-like cozy game with all the fishing, farming and friendship that cozy gamers crave.</p>  <p>That $75,000 figure may seem like a warning sign from the start. It’s not enough to develop the loading screens, let alone a game. But over the years, that’s kinda how Kickstarter’s become. Projects don’t receive any funds at all if their target isn’t met, so if you put your actual forecast costs, say $5 million, as the target, you’ll almost definitely not raise and it not get a penny. So developers come in very low, ensuring that they get <em>something</em>, with stretch goals in place to encourage more pledges that could actually deliver the game. And that’s obviously a disastrous model, meaning games that need $5m might raise $100,000 and then clearly be unable to deliver, resulting in abandoned projects and furious backers. It happens all the time.</p>

 <p>But in the case of&nbsp;<em>PuffPals</em>, it seemed to work. $75,000 became $2.56 million, more than double their top stretch goal figure. As Mujin reveals, however, a lot of that figure was extremely fudged: You could back the project for $20 to get the game on release, but afterward there were “add-ons,” where you could pay another $40 or so to get a plush toy too, and those plushies were ones that had sold out and were highly sought after by collectors. The money still counted toward the Kickstarter total, but a significant portion of it was going toward the toy and its shipping. Which is to say, that $2.6m figure did not remotely reflect what they actually had to spend on the game.</p>

 <p>The project then began to follow the failing Kickstarter playbook to the letter. Updates started to slow down, promises would be forgotten or explained away, and <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/fluffnest/puffpals-island-skies/posts/4309530">wild excuses would be given for why communication had been bad</a>, all always accompanied by <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/fluffnest/puffpals-island-skies/posts/4324878">new promises that all these things would improve</a>. You’ll always get the six-month silence, followed by the “<a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/fluffnest/puffpals-island-skies/posts/4163760">Sorry we’ve been so quiet, we’ve been working so hard!</a>” update accompanied by scant few gifs and a bunch of concept art to “prove” it. And then, of course, a promised alpha build will get <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/fluffnest/puffpals-island-skies/posts/4335798">delayed</a> and <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/fluffnest/puffpals-island-skies/posts/4364462">delayed</a>, each missed milestone accompanied by an excuse that contradicts the last. Next you get the heartfelt apologies and promises to improve communication, along with a boast that the build is just moments away, before another stretch of silence ending in claims that the build, due years before, is “on track.” It’s all so painfully common.</p>

 <figure id="attachment_2000629156" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000629156"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000629156">© Kickstarter / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p>But the&nbsp;<em>PuffPals</em> debacle took it all to a new level, by seemingly not only messing their Kickstarter backers around, but customers of their main business too.&nbsp;During the waits, Reddit sleuths spotted that <em>PuffPals </em>trademarks had expired a year ago, and that the game was seemingly being entirely created by outsourcing company Room 8, while the plushies side of the business started having its own major troubles, with customers not receiving shipments, claiming they had been overcharged, and delivery prices being almost tripled. It then became apparent the company was being sued for failure to pay back business loans.</p>

 <p>Then things got even worse. Fluffnest was going out of business. Blaming rising shipping costs, the company declared it was coming to an end. And yet even here, in this statement, it said, “<em>Island Skies</em> production is secured and will not be affected.” Which, given it hadn’t given any substantial proof of life in years, and it had already been revealed that the entire game was being created by outsourced companies, was quite the claim.</p>

 <p>The <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/fluffnest/puffpals-island-skies/posts/4390672">last update on <em>PuffPals</em> appeared on May 21 this year</a>, and it was an extraordinary screed of excuses and blame laid at the feet of the company they’d paid (and then not paid) to develop the game. And, of course, every word of it contradicts the promises made in previous posts, even as recently as a month earlier.</p> <p>Today, the game’s pre-order page is an&nbsp;<a href="https://expireddomains.com/domain/fluffnest.games"><em>Expired Domains</em> landing page</a>, the Kickstarter has been abandoned for four months, and people who worked on the game have reported going unpaid. And obviously no one is getting refunds—but it’s important to remember that Kickstarter backing doesn’t guarantee a delivered project, so that’s always murky ground.</p> <p>Various lawsuits reported by Mujin show judgments being made against Fluffnest, ordering the company to repay owed money totaling hundreds of thousands of dollars. Meanwhile, the company hired to actually make the game, Room 8, is now suing Fluffnest and David Pentland for $1.9 million.</p> <p>While the various litigations drag through the courts, it’s impossible to know how a super-cute cozy game became such a multi-million dollar disaster. Was this begun in good faith, before collapsing around their ears? Was it a deliberate scam? Was Alpha 2 ever actually a thing that existed? We don’t know, and given court dates stretch as far away as summer 2027, we likely won’t know for a very long time. Either way, it’s astonishingly unlikely anyone will get any of their money back, whether a backer or a developer hired on the project, or even a bank providing one of the many loans. Meanwhile, people will just have to play one of the other 72,482 cozy village life games on PC instead.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>An original but unused ending cutscene for <em>Spider-Man 2: Enter Electro,</em> released in 2001, was long thought to be lost to time, with only a single screenshot of it remaining online. But that all changed earlier this week when someone who downloaded the original ending over 20 years ago remembered they had it and uploaded it to the internet.</p> <p>First, a bit of history:<em> Spider-Man: Enter Electro</em> was published by Activision back in 2001 as a sequel to the beloved PS1/N64 <em>Spider-Man</em> game from Neversoft. The 2001 game wasn’t quite as popular as the first game due to the launch of the PS2 and<em> Grand Theft Auto 3.</em> Anyway, <em>Enter Electro</em> was set to launch on September 18, 2001. But after the September 11 terrorist attacks, Activision delayed the game due to its ending, which was set on the Twin Towers. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spider-Man_2:_Enter:_Electro#Delay_and_modifications">Some changes were made</a>, and <em>Enter Electro</em> finally launched on October 18. The pre-9/11 version of the game became a bit of an alluring mystery for fans, and rumors of a cut ending involving Thor spread online. For a long time, this was just a silly online rumor thought to be fake. Then, <a href="https://lostmediawiki.com/Spider-Man_2:_Enter_Electro_(found_web-exclusive_%22Thor%22_cutscene_from_PlayStation_action-adventure_sequel_game;_2001)">in 2023, a screenshot of Thor talking to Spider-Man was found</a> on an old Activision website that let users download the cutscene. But nobody had a copy and so it was thought to be lost media, until September 22 of this year.</p> <p><a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/action/after-24-years-as-lost-media-a-legendary-cutscene-from-a-ps1-spider-man-game-that-was-delayed-and-censored-in-the-wake-of-9-11-has-finally-been-found-and-preserved-online/">On Monday, as spotted by <em>Gamesradar</em>,</a> <em>Spider-Man 2: Enter Electro’</em>s Thor cutscene, rumored to be the game’s original ending, was uploaded to the internet by Instagram user BobbyFan85. Why did they have a copy of this long-sought-after cutscene? Because they are a digital hoarder, apparently.</p>

 <p>“Earlier today, I read an article that said this S<em>pider-Man: Enter Electro</em> video was lost media,” <a href="https://www.instagram.com/reel/DO7ZQ0xEQGo/?utm_source=ig_embed&amp;ig_rid=27c730eb-416f-4002-8edb-101d733dec56">posted BobbyFan85</a>. “I knew I had it on one of my old hard drives, and sure enough, I found it! Says I downloaded it on Oct 16, 2001. Glad I never delete anything!”</p>

 <p>In the cutscene, which has since been uploaded to the <a href="https://archive.org/details/thorcutscene">Internet Archive and YouTube</a>, we can indeed see that after Spider-Man defeats Electro on top of the Twin Towers, Thor appears to make a cameo, say hi to Spidey, and then blow up Electro’s powerful and evil device. Here’s the cutscene:</p>

  <p>It’s a bit odd, but it’s intended to be a reference to the original <em>Spider-Man</em> game, which ended with the reveal that Captain America got all the credit for saving the day. And in the actual <a href="https://youtu.be/ObSAa1Y_kak">ending</a> of <em>Spider-Man 2: Enter Electro</em>, this same joke is made, but this time it’s Thor who gets the glory. It seems that either this cutscene was intended to expand on the joke or was just a silly extra created by the devs for some promotional reasons, hence why it was once available for download on an old Activision website.</p> <p>Either way, this mystery is solved. Now, can someone explain why my copy of <em>Spider-Man</em> on the PS1 was marked as supporting “Two Players” but was in fact a single-player-only game? This annoyed my parents, my brother, and me. Thanks for the help!</p>
