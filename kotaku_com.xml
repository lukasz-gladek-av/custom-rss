            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><span>In most ways, </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/digimon-story-time-stranger-the-kotaku-review-2000630341"><i><span>Digimon Story: Time Stranger</span></i></a> <span>isn‚Äôt a complicated RPG. The turn-based monster tamer‚Äôs battles are mostly straightforward, and it‚Äôs got waypoints telling you where to go for most missions. However, after spending 40 hours in the game, I do have a few quick tips for those of you heading to the Digital World now that the game is out. Grab your Digivice and let‚Äôs go.</span></p> <h2><b>You will lose access to side quests for dozens of hours</b></h2> <p><span>Easily the most frustrating thing I encountered in my first playthrough of </span><i><span>Time Stranger </span></i><span>was the way it gates side quests. Without getting into spoilers, there‚Äôs a point when the game will warn you that some of the side quests you‚Äôve been doing will be inaccessible for an undetermined amount of time. Years of playing video games had me expecting this meant I wouldn‚Äôt be able to complete those quests until I finished the story mission I was about to embark on. As it turns out, it would be dozens of hours before I could go back to those quests. This would normally have been fine, but side quests have a lot more to offer in </span><i><span>Time Stranger </span></i><span>than just a side story and some loot. Throughout the game, you‚Äôll get Anomaly Points that raise your Agent rank. Digivolution levels are gated behind leveling up this rank, and if you can‚Äôt complete more quests, you might be stuck at a lower rank and unable to level up your party until much, </span><i><span>much </span></i><span>later in the game. So heed this warning when you hit it, because it really fails to adequately warn you just how long it will be before you can go back to those missions.</span></p>

 <h2><b>Using items doesn‚Äôt cost you a turn</b></h2> <p><span>One of the merciful things </span><i><span>Time Stranger </span></i><span>does is that it allows you to use an item </span><i><span>and </span></i><span>attack each turn, rather than choosing between them. This means you‚Äôll be able to heal up your team, raise stats, or remove a status effect without having to give up doing some damage as well. A lot of other turn-based RPGs tend to make you choose between these options as a strategic challenge, but you‚Äôll be glad </span><i><span>Time Stranger</span></i><span> doesn‚Äôt when you endure one of its long, drawn-out boss fights.</span></p>

 <h2><b>Upgrading your Agent rank helps circumvent grind</b></h2> <p><span>Those Anomaly points you get for completing quests are used to upgrade your Agent rank, which enables you to unlock Agent skills on a skill tree. Some of these perks are universal, such as giving you access to new high-impact Cross Arts abilities that can benefit your whole team. However, some of them are applied only to certain Digimon with different personality types. If you go down one skill tree, you‚Äôll be able to raise stats and experience for the friendly Digimon in your team, while another path will grant you those perks for brave Digimon. So don‚Äôt just go down these skill trees without some plan in place, as they can help you reach powerful new heights if you target specific traits and personality types. It‚Äôs much simpler than grinding random battles.</span></p>

 <h2><b>Don‚Äôt get precious about saving your Cross Art</b></h2> <p><span>Cross Arts abilities can have a wide variety of uses in battles. They can heal your team, raise their stats, or they can take a chunk of your enemy‚Äôs health bar down and leave them with debuffs for a few turns. Since they can be so impactful, you might feel like you need to hold your Cross Art for a big boss fight, but this ability charges up fast when you do pretty much anything in battle. Attacking an enemy or using an item can give you points toward your Cross Arts gauge, so it‚Äôs pretty easy to fire off multiple uses of this in a longer fight. Feel free to use it often, and keep in mind that the more actions you can do in a turn, the more charge you‚Äôll get toward using it again.&nbsp;</span></p> <h2><b>Try to have a rideable Digimon on your team at all times</b></h2> <p><span>Some Digimon can double as both a party member and a rideable mount. I rode my Growlmon for much of the game, but when he digivolved to WarGrowlmon, he couldn‚Äôt carry me on his shoulders anymore. Thankfully, WereGarurumon stepped up and put me on his shoulder, and later, when he became MetalGarurumon, I was able to ride on his back. Riding your Digimon gets you places faster than walking on foot, but as they transform into new, stronger versions of themselves, they might lose the ability to carry you around. Just be mindful of this as you move throughout the evolution tree.</span></p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/kingmakers-delay-medieval-shooter-steam-early-access-date-2000631559</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/viral-medieval-shooter-with-giant-armies-gets-indefinitely-delayed-just-days-before-launch.1316125/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><em>Kingmakers</em> was due out in Early Access in just a few days but it‚Äôs apparently not ready yet. The medieval sandbox shooter has been indefinitely delayed as the team at Redemption Road works on getting everything working as intended. ‚ÄúWe just need a bit more time on content polish before we feel good about charging money for it,‚Äù the studio wrote in an announcement on Friday.</p> <p>Odds are you‚Äôve seen a <a href="https://kotaku.com/this-time-hopping-action-game-brings-a-grenade-launcher-1851274937">bit of <em>Kingmakers</em> here or there</a> over the years, even if you didn‚Äôt know it. The multiplayer game features sprawling maps and giant armies and is supposed to facilitate real-time destruction as you engage in everything from medieval combat to blowing up a bunch of armor-clad knights with tanks. The game‚Äôs impressive physics simulation helped it go viral on social media, land a big trailer at Summer Game Fest this year, and become the sixth most-wishlisted game on Steam. So it‚Äôs surprising to see it pulled from launch at the last minute.</p>

 <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="zxx" dir="ltr"><a href="https://t.co/HhiDBLQrOS">pic.twitter.com/HhiDBLQrOS</a></p> <p>‚Äî Ian Fisch ‚Äì Lead Coder on Kingmakers (wishlist!) (@Ian_Fisch) <a href="https://twitter.com/Ian_Fisch/status/1974143748419563537?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 3, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <p>‚ÄúAfter much contemplation, we realize that the scheduled<em> Kingmakers</em> launch on October 8 will no longer be possible,‚Äù the team <a href="https://x.com/Ian_Fisch/status/1974143748419563537">announced today</a>. ‚ÄúWe want to apologize to all of the fans who are eagerly anticipating this game. We are sorry for letting you down.‚Äù</p>

 <p>The rest of the message goes on to try to explain why the game is being indefinitely delayed. TL;DR:<em> Kingmakers</em> is ambitions and delivering on that is hard!</p> <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">GTA6, but you're dropped in the 1400s.<br>No cops. Just the angry knights you ran over üöó <a href="https://t.co/tLmQjUgmM3">pic.twitter.com/tLmQjUgmM3</a></p> <p>‚Äî Kingmakers ‚öîÔ∏è (@Kingmakers_Game) <a href="https://twitter.com/Kingmakers_Game/status/1929956825589584144?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">June 3, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <p>‚ÄúWe currently have tens of thousands of soldiers, each with AI and pathfinding that rivals what you‚Äôd expect from an AAA third-person shooter,‚Äù Redemption Road states. ‚ÄúWhen you walk away from a battle, it continues to play out. Nothing is faked. We have giant 6-story castles where every room can be entered and every wall, floor, and ceiling destroyed. When you build a lumbermill, it‚Äôs a real place that can be entered, or, in an enemy invasion, turned into a combat arena.‚Äù</p> <p>The studio doesn‚Äôt really go into much more detail than that but promises that a deep-dive overview will be livestreamed soon to update players on where things are at. That makes it sound like the delay won‚Äôt just be a couple of weeks or months. Will it still be out before the end of 2026? We‚Äôll see. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre making sure everyone who buys the game is enthralled and feels like their money was well spent,‚Äù the developers wrote.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/taylor-swift-life-showgirl-reaction-reviews-songs-wood-2000631553</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/the-internet-reacts-to-taylor-swift%E2%80%99s-new-album.1316077/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><span>Every time Taylor Swift, the country star turned pop royalty, releases a new album, it‚Äôs a cultural event, whether you‚Äôre a Swiftie or not. This is because the algorithm will no doubt feed you reactions and commentary just because you are, at most, one degree removed from the </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/taylor-swift-shakes-her-polys-in-band-hero-5329622"><i><span>Band Hero</span></i></a> <span>star‚Äôs fandom at all times. </span><i><span>The Life of a Showgirl </span></i><span>is Swift‚Äôs 12th album, and turns the dial back into radio/TikTok-ready pop after </span><i><span>The Tortured Poets Department </span></i><span>went for a more melancholic, folky sound. But is it any good? Well, Swifties are sorting through their feelings.</span></p> <p><span>Like most of Swift‚Äôs work, </span><i><span>The Life of a Showgirl</span></i><span> is pretty transparent in its references to her personal life. As that personal life has become so </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/taylor-swift-life-of-a-showgirl-announcement-cover-date-2000617177"><span>well-known in and out of her music</span></a><span>, it‚Äôs usually pretty obvious who a song is about. So there‚Äôs some lore to unpack with a lot of these songs, but the ones that are getting the most attention right now are the ones that seem to reference her </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/taylor-swift-travis-kelce-engaged-ring-reaction-2000620394"><span>fianc√© Travis Kelce‚Äôs hog</span></a><span> and seem to escalate an apparent feud between her and pop star Charli XCX that, at least publicly, appears largely one-sided at the moment.</span></p> <p><span>Let‚Äôs start with the song that is all about how well-endowed the Kansas City football player is. ‚ÄúWood‚Äù starts out with a funky riff and a catchy beat, and you can already hear the Sabrina Carpenter influence in the composition. Then you hear the lyrics and you can tell that Swift is trying to emulate the </span><i><span>Short n‚Äô Sweet </span></i><span>singer‚Äôs trademark graphic, sexual punchlines. Here, let‚Äôs look at the lyrics of the second verse.</span></p> <blockquote><p><span>Forgive me, it sounds cocky</span></p> <p><span>He ah-matized me and open–µd my eyes</span></p> <p><span>Redwood tree, it ain‚Äôt hard to see</span></p> <p><span>His lov–µ was the key that opened my thighs</span></p> <p><span>Girls, I don‚Äôt need to catch the bouquet, mm</span></p> <p><span>To know a hard rock is on the way</span></p> <p><span>And baby, I‚Äôll admit I‚Äôve been a little superstitious</span></p> <p><span>The curse on me was broken by your magic wand</span></p> <p><span>Seems to be that you and me, we make our own luck</span></p> <p><span>New Heights of manhood</span></p></blockquote>   <p><span>If the clear reference to Kelce‚Äôs </span><i><span>New Heights </span></i><span>podcast wasn‚Äôt enough to make it clear that this is about her man‚Äôs schlong, the reference to a ‚Äúhard rock‚Äù like the one on her finger would make it pretty clear. There‚Äôs an episode of </span><i><span>How I Met Your Mother </span></i><span>in which Marshall (Jason Segal) realizes he can‚Äôt tell any sexy stories from his dating life to his friends without everyone knowing they‚Äôre about his long-time partner Lily (Alyson Hannigan) because she‚Äôs the only one he‚Äôs really been with. Part of what makes love songs such a popular genre of music is that there‚Äôs a universality to them that people can project onto their own relationships. Who among us wouldn‚Äôt love to sing about a man‚Äôs dick lifting a curse and solving all our problems? But Swift‚Äôs very public personal life and clear references to her husband-to-be mean that I can‚Äôt hear this song without knowing whose dick it‚Äôs about.</span></p>   <p><span>That being said, the song is pretty catchy. What Swift may lack in Carpenter‚Äôs clever jokes, she makes up for in a fun song about love and lust. And hey, Kelce seems cool with it?</span></p>   <p><span>One song I have a less charitable read on, however, is ‚ÄúActually Romantic,‚Äù which takes the other side of ‚Äúeveryone knowing your business‚Äù and seems to be essentially a diss track against Charli XCX. For those who don‚Äôt know, Charli has a song called ‚ÄúSympathy Is a Knife‚Äù on the album </span><i><span>Brat</span></i><span> that addresses her insecurities in the pop girl space, and seemingly references Swift specifically triggering those feelings of comparison in her. ‚ÄúActually Romantic‚Äù is being called a diss track aimed at the ‚Äú360‚Äù singer, and at first blush, some think Swift may have straight-up misunderstood the intent behind ‚ÄúSympathy Is a Knife,‚Äù which is actually fairly complimentary to her.&nbsp;</span></p>   <p><span>However, ‚ÄúActually Romantic‚Äù does seem to gesture at further drama behind the scenes, even as Swift has been publicly supportive of Charli. Specifically, it references Swift‚Äôs past relationship with Matty Healy of the band 1975, which also includes Charli‚Äôs husband George Daniel, and things Charli has allegedly said about Swift in private.</span></p> <blockquote><p><span>I heard you call me ‚ÄòBoring Barbie‚Äô when the coke‚Äôs got you brave&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>High-fived my ex and then said you‚Äôre glad he ghosted me&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>Wrote me a song saying it makes you sick to see my face</span></p> <p><span>Some people might be offended&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>But it‚Äôs actually sweet&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>All the time you‚Äôve spent on me.</span></p></blockquote> <p><span>I guess I can buy that maybe there‚Äôs more happening than ‚ÄúSympathy Is a Knife‚Äù lets on. It‚Äôs giving </span><i><span>Reputation</span></i><span> era, when Swift was very publicly calling out other public figures like Kanye West and Kim Kardashian, or </span><i><span>1989</span></i><span>‚Äôs ‚ÄúBad Blood‚Äù which referenced her now-ended feud with pop star </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/katy-perry-womans-world-music-video-pokemon-pikachu-1851590464"><span>Katy Perry</span></a><span>. Again, it‚Äôs the effect of someone‚Äôs personal life being so public that these songs end up weaving a story that‚Äôs already playing out on social media and in gossip magazines. Though if this is all spun off from ‚ÄúSympathy Is a Knife,‚Äù then it feels like punching down.</span></p> <p><span>The problem with </span><i><span>Life of a Showgirl</span></i><span> is that Swift‚Äôs status as a billionaire mega-celebrity clashes against the ‚Äúrelatable‚Äù persona she exhibits in her music here more than ever before. ‚ÄúEldest Daughter‚Äù laments how mean everyone on the internet can be, when she‚Äôs enveloped in a massive cocoon of wealth and status. Like, girl, why are you even reading TikTok comments when you could be doing literally anything else with all that money?</span></p> <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="und" dir="ltr">lol <a href="https://t.co/a78pUaSvCU">https://t.co/a78pUaSvCU</a> <a href="https://t.co/quyrERr07R">pic.twitter.com/quyrERr07R</a></p> <p>‚Äî grace spelman (@GraceSpelman) <a href="https://twitter.com/GraceSpelman/status/1973974944607580252?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 3, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <p><span>Another song that really sticks out as an expression of Swift imagining threats to her status is ‚ÄúCANCELLED!‚Äù which I saw someone say is destined to become the new anthem of MAGA wine moms, and I can‚Äôt stop thinking about it. As the title suggests, the song is all about perceived judgments of her for who she chooses to associate with, with her singing that she likes her friends ‚Äúcancelled‚Äù and cloaked in ‚Äúscandal.‚Äù Broadly, this could be a song about cancel culture and how Swift is unwilling to drop people just because they run afoul of public scrutiny, but given that she has </span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Fauxmoi/comments/1n4fj0i/taylor_swift_celebrates_brittany_maga_mahomes/"><span>friends who are public Trump supporters</span></a><span>, that feels like underselling or minimizing people‚Äôs criticism as some kind of petty scandal, rather than a legitimate concern.</span></p>   <p><span>Ultimately, all of these reactions are born from the relationship with her fandom that Swift has cultivated over her decades-long career. When your personal life is the source of the characters and stories people listen for references to in each song, every album is like a new season of a television show for which millions of people tune in just to lap up every new lore drop. But is the music any good? In my first listen, I came away thinking that </span><i><span>Life of a Showgirl </span></i><span>is an obvious low point in Swift‚Äôs discography. I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôm alone in that assessment, but the album has been out for all of 12 hours at this point, and people will sort their feelings out over the next few weeks or months. Tonight, Swift is putting out a movie in theaters called </span><i><span>The Official Release Party of a Showgirl</span></i><span>, which will include commentary and context for the album from Swift. Maybe that will work in its favor. For now, the music is speaking for itself. For better or worse.</span></p> <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="zxx" dir="ltr"><a href="https://t.co/fEAu5T8XnL">pic.twitter.com/fEAu5T8XnL</a></p> <p>‚Äî emily (@grIgenius) <a href="https://twitter.com/grIgenius/status/1973971796795011134?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 3, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">every year a taylor swift album comes out and she goes roses are red grass is green i love travis and my haters are mean and her fans go Omgggggg the lyricism</p> <p>‚Äî zade (@zadtwt) <a href="https://twitter.com/zadtwt/status/1973855618890158350?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 2, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">she did it omg <a href="https://t.co/pRaiOFRgtG">https://t.co/pRaiOFRgtG</a> <a href="https://t.co/idYwgDuRH0">pic.twitter.com/idYwgDuRH0</a></p> <p>‚Äî Wendell (@RhodeToLove) <a href="https://twitter.com/RhodeToLove/status/1973970282617667816?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 3, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">yall im CRYINGNSIDNDHF <a href="https://t.co/nC25tp2KcZ">pic.twitter.com/nC25tp2KcZ</a></p> <p>‚Äî allypally (@allypallyxcx) <a href="https://twitter.com/allypallyxcx/status/1974027869689983175?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 3, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="zxx" dir="ltr"><a href="https://t.co/3CIXeCfhyy">https://t.co/3CIXeCfhyy</a> <a href="https://t.co/NAQvUVy9Qp">pic.twitter.com/NAQvUVy9Qp</a></p> <p>‚Äî The Coke That Made Charli xcx Brave (@Neil_McNeil) <a href="https://twitter.com/Neil_McNeil/status/1974002104575328501?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 3, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="zxx" dir="ltr"><a href="https://t.co/O23bECsSMr">https://t.co/O23bECsSMr</a> <a href="https://t.co/iK8u3dO19T">pic.twitter.com/iK8u3dO19T</a></p> <p>‚Äî keira (@kettlevinyl) <a href="https://twitter.com/kettlevinyl/status/1973991187330576725?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 3, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">These aren‚Äôt lyrics born of depth, just reference points engineered to ride the current wave internet talking points like ‚Äòeldest daughters suffer more than jesus‚Äô and spark a shallow ‚Äòshe‚Äôs just like me‚Äô emotion from its listener.

              <p>Spooky season is upon us, and that means the movie theater schedules are stacked with horror movies. This year, more than ever, bigger names are being drawn to the genre as it proves one of the most resilient ways of getting butts in seats. With Guillermo del Toro‚Äôs <em>Frankenstein</em> leading the pack, we‚Äôve also got Ethan Hawke returning for&nbsp;<em>Black Phone 2</em>, Keira Knightley in&nbsp;<em>The Woman in Cabin 10</em>, and both Justin Long and Kate Bosworth appearing in&nbsp;<em>Coyotes</em>. And so many more besides. So, to be helpful, we‚Äôve rounded up the trailers for all of October‚Äôs scariest upcoming horror movies.</p> <p>Horror is big business right now, with studios having finally noticed that if you put more than no money into a scary film, you can still make them super-cheap and see some stellar returns. As such, we‚Äôre seeing some bigger names wanting to get involved, alongside the gloriously kitsch and classically gory. Below, in order of U.S. release date across October, are our picks for flicks to scare you out of you knicks.</p> <h2><em>Good Boy</em></h2>  <p>Out today (<strong>October 3</strong>) and getting rave reviews (including <a href="https://kotaku.com/good-boy-does-the-dog-die-horror-movie-indy-showtimes-2000631497">this praise from <em>Kotaku</em>‚Äòs own Kenneth Shepard</a>),&nbsp;<em>Good Boy</em> is a horror movie from the perspective of a dog. Indy the doggo is determined to protect his human buddy Todd from evil forces in a surprisingly short film‚Äîjust 72 minutes. It‚Äôs written and directed by Ben Leonberg, his first feature-length movie, and stars his own pet dog Indy‚Äîa Nova Scotia Duck Tolling Retriever‚Äîin the lead role. The human cast are relative unknowns (although perhaps not for long) Arielle Friedman and Shane Jensen, alongside Hollywood stalwart portrayer of homeless gentlemen, Stuart Rudin.</p> <h2><em>Bone Lake</em></h2>  <p>Has there been a more on-the-nose name for a horror movie since 1999‚Äôs ridiculous&nbsp;<em>Cherry Falls</em>?&nbsp;<em>Bone Lake</em> is a sexy horror flick from director Mercedes Bryce Morgan, previously best known for, er,&nbsp;<em>Stargate Origins: Catherine</em>. The Bleecker Street release is clearly attempting to evoke a little bit of&nbsp;<em>Saltburn</em>, but in a story about two couples accidentally booking the same AirBnB for the same weekend. Except, for some reason, everyone keeps taking their clothes off and/or being chopped up by axes and chainsaws. I mean, it sounds like all the elements for a stone-cold B-movie classic. The first handful of reviews have been middling, but then this was never a movie to win over the&nbsp;<em>New York Times</em>. It too is out today, <strong>October 3</strong>.</p> <h2><em>Coyotes</em></h2>  <p>Yet another <strong>October 3</strong> release is comedy horror film <em>Coyotes</em>. Real-life couple Kate Bosworth <em>(Superman</em> <em>Returns</em>, <em>Before I Wake</em>) and Justin Long (<em>Weapons</em>,&nbsp;<em>Galaxy Quest</em>) reunite after appearing together in 2022‚Äôs&nbsp;<em>Barbarian</em>, as parents trapped in their home by a savage pack of‚Ä¶you guessed right, coyotes. It looks tremendously silly, incredibly violent, and contains the line, ‚ÄúGET THE FUCK OFF MY HUSBAND.‚Äù That‚Äôs all I need. It‚Äôs directed by Colin Minihan (<em>What Keeps You Alive</em>,&nbsp;<em>Grave Encounters</em>) and looks like some very schlocky fun.</p> <h2><em>V/H/S Halloween</em></h2>  <p>The infinite arms of the&nbsp;<em>V/H/S</em> franchise reach out yet again, this time with a collection of seven Halloween-themed shorts, one of which comes from director Casper Kelly, the man behind Adult Swim‚Äôs&nbsp;<em>Your Pretty Face Is Going to Hell</em>,&nbsp;<em>Stroker &amp; Hoop</em>, and the infamous <em>Infomercials</em> episode,&nbsp;<em>Too Many Cooks</em>. It‚Äôs on Shudder from today, <strong>October 3</strong>.</p> <h2><em>Scared Shitless</em></h2>  <p>The final <strong>October 3</strong> release (you could watch new horror movies all night tonight!) is&nbsp;<em>Scared Shitless</em>, which looks like it should be hilarious, but the trailer doesn‚Äôt have me convinced. It looks like it‚Äôs trying a bit too hard with its glove puppet toilet monster and overly wacky goofs. If you recognize the older lead guy, that‚Äôs because he‚Äôs Steven Ogg, Trevor Phillips from <em>GTA V</em>! His son is played by Daniel Doheny (<em>Brand New Cherry Flavor</em>) wearing what looks like his first beard, starring alongside the mighty Julian Richings and Mark McKinney. It‚Äôs the first theatrically released movie from Canadian comedy director Vivieno Caldinelli, who is more usually shooting skits for sketch shows.</p> <h2><em>Vicious</em></h2>  <p>Paramount Plus gets in on the spooky action <strong>October 10</strong> with Dakota Fanning in&nbsp;<em>Vicious</em>. It seems to set itself up as a film about a woman who is cursed to find three objects, one she loves, one she hates, and one she can‚Äôt live without, and put them all in a box before midnight. Should she fail, she‚Äôll die. That‚Äôs a great premise, given how hard it would be to look inside yourself and answer those three questions truthfully, but the trailer suggests things are going in about seventy-three other directions too. Clearly Dakota Fanning is a big win for Paramount‚Äôs streamer, in a movie written and directed by Bryan ‚Äú<em>The Strangers‚Äù</em> Bertino.</p> <h2><em>The Woman in Cabin 10</em></h2>  <p>On the same day, <strong>October 10</strong>, rival streamer Netflix has its own big-name horror release with <em>The Woman in Cabin 10</em>. Kiera Knightley leads, with Guy Pearce (<em>Memento</em>,&nbsp;<em>L.A. Confidential</em>) pulling off a very convincing British accent. It‚Äôs all about a reporter on a luxury yacht who thinks she sees a death, and is then hounded and gaslit by the super-posh people on board. Part scary thriller, part whodunnit mystery, it‚Äôs directed by Simon Stone, the Swiss director behind 2021‚Äôs well-respected&nbsp;<em>The Dig</em>.</p> <h2><em>Black Phone 2</em></h2>  <p>2021‚Äôs&nbsp;<em>The Black Phone</em> was an interesting choice for star Ethan Hawke. More usually mumbling through indie roles directed by Richard Linklater, here he jumped into the post-<em>Saw</em> trend for terrifying iconic horror villains: a serial child-killer known as the Grabber. Four years later, Hawke returns to the Blumhouse production for a classic-style sequel, with a should-be-dead enemy returning for revenge against the older cast of the original. Director Scott Derrickson is hit or miss, with a dreadful remake of <em>The Day the Earth Stood Still</em> and some middling horrors like&nbsp;<em>Sinister</em> and&nbsp;<em>The Gorge</em>, but he also gave us the solid <em>Doctor Strange.&nbsp;</em>The trailer looks fantastic, seeming to repeat the Wes Craven meets Stephen King ‚Äô70s vibes of the original. It‚Äôs out <strong>October 17</strong>.</p> <h2><em>Frankenstein</em></h2>  <p>Netflix has funded Guillermo del Toro‚Äôs version of&nbsp;<em>Frankenstein</em>, with a short theatrical release on <strong>October 17</strong> before it arrives on Netflix November 7. (Clearly the streamer thinks there could be trophies in this one.) It‚Äôs sticking to the gothic horror of Shelley‚Äôs novel, looking like a relatively faithful interpretation, albeit through del Toro‚Äôs extraordinary imagination, with Oscar Isaac (<em>Ex Machina</em>, <em>Moon Knight</em>) <em>as</em> Dr. Frankenstein and Jacob Elordi (<em>Euphoria</em>) as his creation, alongside Mia Goth (<em>Pearl</em>, <em>Infinity Pool</em>) as Elizabeth. Del Toro doesn‚Äôt miss, so there‚Äôs every reason to be very excited for this one.</p> <h2><em>R.L. Stine‚Äôs Pumpkinhead</em></h2>  <p>I could pretend it wasn‚Äôt this trailer that made me want to write this entire article, but I‚Äôm not ashamed. 81-year-old Robert Lawrence Stine, the author of the&nbsp;<em>Goosebumps</em> novels, has his name glued to the title of this&nbsp;<em>Pumpkinhead</em> remake (the original starring Lance Henriksen came out in 1988), but he is neither writer nor director. Both those roles fall to Jem Garrard, the director behind last year‚Äôs Tubi queer vampire flick <em>Slay</em>. They are back with Tubi for this movie too, a kid-friendly (although not&nbsp;<em>that</em> friendly) film that reimagines the very adult original as something a touch more tame. It‚Äôs on Tubi <strong>October 17</strong>.</p> <h2><em>The Hand That Rocks the Cradle</em></h2>  <p>Yup, it‚Äôs back. Curtis Hanson‚Äôs 1992 classic, starring Annabella Sciorra, Rebecca De Mornay and Matt McCoy, as well as Ernie Hudson, Julianne Moore and Madeline Zima, had one of the darkest plots of all time. A sexual predator is caught and kills himself, which causes his widowed wife to miscarry, and in turn drives her to seek revenge on one of his accusers by becoming her nanny and destroying her life. This time, however, the film is less thriller, more horror, given it‚Äôs directed by Mexican horror pro Michelle Garza Cervera. And it doesn‚Äôt seem to be following the original film‚Äôs motives for its characters, either, with nanny Polly Murphy (Maika Monroe of <em>Longlegs </em>and&nbsp;<em>It Follows</em>) hired by upper-class mom Caitlin Morales (Mary Elizabeth Winstead of <em>10 Cloverfield Lane</em>), who then begins infiltrating her life and marriage. But also, there‚Äôs some other weird darkness going on here, something more overtly creepy. It comes to Hulu and Disney+ <strong>October 22</strong>.</p> <h2><em>Shelby Oaks</em></h2>  <p>Arriving on big screens <strong>October 24</strong>,&nbsp;<em>Shelby Oaks</em> looks fucking terrifying. It has the big boost of Mike Flanagan as an executive producer, and is directed by former YouTube movie critic Chris Stuckmann (<em>Chris Stuckmann Movie Reviews</em>). There are some real mixed media vibes to the trailer, in a film about a woman trying to find her missing sister, and beginning to suspect that a demon they imagined in their childhoods might be a bit too real. Camille Sullivan (<em>She Talks to Strangers</em>) is the lead,&nbsp;<em>Mayor of Kingstown</em>‚Äòs Michael Beach is here as a detective, and I‚Äôm delighted to say it also stars the always-wonderful Keith David.</p> <h2><em>In Our Blood</em></h2>  <p>‚ÄúIndie horror‚Äù too often means rubbery monsters shot on iPhone, but that‚Äôs not the case here.&nbsp;<em>In Our Blood</em> has the vibes of an indie that scoops all the awards at a film festival, but harnessed here to deliver a super-weird and disturbing lo-fi movie about filmmakers making a documentary about reuniting with an estranged mother. However, she‚Äôs disappeared, and the reasons why are dark and terrible. It‚Äôs directed by Pedro Kos, who has been Oscar nominated for his documentaries, but now turns his hand to narrative. The lead is Brittany O‚ÄôGrady, one of the stars of the first series of <em>The White Lotus</em>, without any other major names to take away the faux-realism of the flick. It‚Äôs in theaters <strong>October 24</strong>.</p> <h2><em>Queens of the</em> <em>Dead</em></h2>  <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/george-a-romeros-daughter-zombie-drag-queen-movie-queens-trailer-2000626904">Tina Romero‚Äôs <em>Queens of the Dead</em></a> is an attempt to make her own mark following the legacy of her father‚Äôs movies. George A. Romero‚Äôs&nbsp;<em>Night of the Living Dead</em> and its sequels are certainly memorable, but none of them followed the adventures of a group of drag queens and club kids attempting to survive the zombie apocalypse. Sillier than her dad‚Äôs films, <a href="https://www.thecurb.com.au/suff-interview-tina-romero-queens-of-the-dead/">she says</a>,&nbsp;<em>Queens of the Dead</em> is a celebration of queer culture and aims to be uplifting in its politics during a very dark time in real life. Starring Jaquel Spivey (<em>Mean Girls 2024</em>), Katy O‚ÄôBrian (<em>The Mandolorian</em>,&nbsp;<em>Love Lies Bleeding</em>) and Margaret Cho, it‚Äôs getting fantastic early buzz, and will be on big screens <strong>October 24</strong>.</p>
