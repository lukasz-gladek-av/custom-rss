            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><span>Ever since </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-legends-za-review-switch-2-bugs-performance-2000637719"><i><span>Pokémon Legends: Z-A</span></i></a> <span>players found out the rare, alternate-colored monsters known as “shiny” Pokémon </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-legends-z-a-shiny-hunting-despawn-sound-effect-2000636142"><span>don’t despawn in this game</span></a><span>, the shiny hunting meta has been rapidly evolving to take advantage of this new change. Some players devised ways early on to farm these rare spawns </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-legends-za-shiny-despawn-afk-exploit-wild-zone-2000636610"><span>without touching their controller</span></a><span>, and now that many players have reached the post-game, some have concocted a method to hunt not only shiny Pokémon, but also the large, powerful, aggressive Alpha Pokémon that are also rare spawns in the game’s world.</span></p> <p><span>This method seems so busted, I wouldn’t be surprised if Game Freak patched it out in a future update, but for the moment, players have a really elaborate way of hunting up to six shiny Alpha Pokémon at a time if they’ve seen the credits (the real credits, not </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-legends-za-credits-npc-dialogue-school-kid-2000638839"><span>the fake ones</span></a><span>). YouTuber Austin John Plays demonstrates the elaborate but effective strategy, which requires you to mess around with and essentially break the Alpha Pokemon in Wild Zone 20’s spawn area so you can trick the game into bringing out more monsters in the area than it’s supposed to. The full method requires you to aggro the Alphas in Wild Zone 20 until they’re near the edge of the fenced-off area. By leaving the zone while these Pokémon are near the edge of it, you’ll make their spawn area essentially reset to the position they were in when you left, meaning the game will trigger </span><i><span>new </span></i><span>Alpha spawns in the center of the zone. If you do this successfully enough times without dying, you can get several Alphas spawning in the zone, and because shiny Pokémon won’t despawn, you can enter, exit, or reset the area by resting on a bench until all six spawned Alphas are shiny.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><span>The whole thing is pretty complicated and requires some precise positioning and saving, but it seems to work. Check out Austin John Plays’ tutorial below:</span></p>  <p><span>I’m always amazed by the commitment shiny hunters bring to breaking the game to find these guys. So far, I’ve stumbled upon two shinies during my playthrough without looking for them, which is more than I typically find in these games. Both the </span><i><span>Legends</span></i><span> games have made spotting shinies easier by adding a visual and audio indicator when one is in the overworld, so I’ve gotten two in both </span><i><span>Z-A </span></i><span>and </span><i><span>Arceus</span></i><span> without even trying.</span></p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/a-surprise-departure-shows-the-problem-with-the-game-pass-%E2%80%98backlog%E2%80%99.1342267/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>There are two major knocks against Game Pass these days. The first is the new $30 price point for access to day-one releases. The second is the fact that you’re basically just renting and don’t actually own any of the games you play. The surprise departure of <a href="https://kotaku.com/stalker-2-review-buggy-janky-impressions-xbox-pc-fps-1851705232"><em>S.T.A.L.K.E.R. 2: Heart of Chornobyl</em></a> in November really drives that home.</p> <p>Subscribers noticed a new notification this month that the post-apocalyptic immersive sim will be part of the batch of games leaving the Netflix-like service in the weeks ahead. The others include <em>Football Manager 2024</em>, <em>Blacksmith Master</em>, and <em>Frostpunk</em>. What caught some players by surprise is just how brief <em>S.T.A.L.K.E.R. 2</em>‘s tour on Game Pass has been. The game only released a year ago and has still been receiving <a href="https://support.stalker2.com/hc/en-us/articles/39316885098257-Update-1-6-Night-of-the-Hunter-is-live">substantial updates</a> to improve performance and fix bugs. Some people no doubt expected they had more time to go back and finish the grueling but rewarding shooter.</p>

 <p>“I think it’s a really bad precedent that a game stays shorter in Game Pass than we had to wait for it to launch, beyond waiting MONTHS to become properly playable patch after patch,” one player wrote in <a href="https://x.com/ZakkenKloot/status/1984925333204689052">a thread on X</a> that gained traction over the weekend. “The game hits PS5 before it even leaves Game Pass.”</p>

 <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">STALKER 2 got announced in 2020 at the Xbox Showcase in August.</p> <p>STALKER 2 took 4 years to develop beyond announcement and officially dropped in November 2024.</p> <p>STALKER 2 will leave Xbox Game Pass in November 2025.</p> <p>I think it’s a really bad precedent that a game stays shorter in… <a href="https://t.co/TZg486uoeg">https://t.co/TZg486uoeg</a></p> <p>— Kloot (@ZakkenKloot) <a href="https://twitter.com/ZakkenKloot/status/1984925333204689052?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 2, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <p>The sentiment was echoed on the Game Pass subreddit. “It’s really frustrating seeing Stalker 2 leave Gamepass,” a player there <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/XboxGamePass/comments/1omcjg9/stalker_2_leaving_game_pass/">wrote</a>. “Game is still a buggy mess, so for those who were waiting on this game to be patched, I guess we’re screwed. lol.” Others argued that no one is “screwed” because you can still go and buy the game at any time, but it does cut against some of the perceived value of Game Pass.</p>

 <p><em>Payday 3</em> was a more <a href="https://kotaku.com/payday-3-starbreeze-flop-ceo-removed-fired-low-sales-1851329780">egregious example of this day-one issue</a>. The launch was a mess, lots of things were broken, and lots of fans went back to playing <em>Payday 2</em> until the sequel improved. But the day-one Game Pass release only stayed on the service for a year. Anyone who bounced off during that early window only to come back closer to its departure might have felt like they were getting a raw deal.</p>

 <p>This is the double-edged sword of the value proposition at the center of Game Pass. One the one hand it’s a massive buffet where power-users can super-sample tons of great games to their heart’s content, from blockbusters like <em>Call of Duty: Black Ops 7</em> to small indie games like <em>Minami Lane</em>. If you spend a lot of time playing lots of different games each week, you can actually get&nbsp;<em>more</em> than your money’s worth out of Game Pass.</p>

 <h2>Game Pass’ airline economy problem</h2> <p>But if you actually want to finish a lot of games, or play certain ones more deeply, it doesn’t always make a lot of sense. <em>S.T.A.L.K.E.R. 2</em> is a good example. It can take 40 hours just to beat, or around 70 hours if you finish all of the side content. There’s a lot of trial and error and un-directed exploration. It’s great for getting lost in, but not for trying to breeze through on your way to other parts of the Game Pass library. It’s a perfect candidate for that backlog game you forget about until it’s not longer on Game Pass. If you’re only playing a couple of games a month, you’re better off buying them outright than renting them for a limited time.</p>

 <p>NYU business professor Joost van Dreunen recently called this Game Pass’ “<a href="https://superjoost.substack.com/p/game-pass-or-fail">airline economics in reverse</a>” problem. “On Game Pass, every user effectively flies business class while paying economy prices, creating an inherently margin-thin model in which heavy users consume disproportionate resources without proportional revenue,” he wrote. Basically, anyone who&nbsp;<em>did</em> spend months finishing <em>S.T.A.L.K.E.R. 2&nbsp;</em>via Game Pass is just subsidizing the cost of the service for everyone who samples dozens of new games each year. The recent price hike is one way of rebalancing that math, Dreuen argues.</p> <p>Put another way, Game Pass gets way too many <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/xbox/comments/1ljaff3/day_one_gamepass_additions_for_2025/">day-one releases every year</a> for any regular person to actually finish most of them. It’s a service for people who like to graze and keep trying new things, not people actually intent on clearing stuff from their backlogs. Anyone who leans closer to the completionist camp should be buying their games.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Surely by now you’ve heard it all: <a href="https://kotaku.com/doom-alarmo-nintendo-alarm-clock-hack-modder-usb-id-pc-1851690005"><i>Doom</i> running on an alarm clock</a>, <a href="https://kotaku.com/doom-running-inside-fortnite-uefn-how-epic-twitter-fps-1851585177">inside <i>Fortnite</i></a>, on <a href="https://kotaku.com/doom-running-on-pdf-weird-port-id-software-fps-pc-mod-1851739634">a simple PDF</a>, and <a href="https://kotaku.com/it-runs-doom-cells-bacteria-1851212417">even on human bacteria</a>. It seems like <a href="https://kotaku.com/doom-weirdest-ports-keyboard-atm-calculator-tractor-pc-1850726374"><i>Doom</i> can run on anything</a>. But what about running <i>Doom</i> on a satellite orbiting the planet while also using images of the Earth taken by the very satellite running the game for the game’s backdrops? Well, some very clever folks managed to pull off that very thing.</p> <p>Ubuntu Summit is a yearly gathering of Linux professionals and enthusiasts where folks show off cool stuff they’re doing with one of the most popular Linux desktop distributions out there. This year, programmer Ólafur Waage dove into how a bunch of clever folks not only got <i>Doom</i> running on an orbital satellite last year, but also how they were able to replace the game’s background image of the terrain and skies of Hell with photos of Earth taken by the satellite (<a href="https://www.tomshardware.com/video-games/doom-can-run-just-about-anywhere-including-space-hacker-recounts-tale-of-running-the-game-on-an-orbiting-satellite">h/t <i>Tom’s Hardware</i></a>). It was no easy feat, but it resulted in a new frontier for <i>Doom</i> ports. Check out Waage’s presentation of <i>Doom</i> in space during the summit <a href="https://youtu.be/bEEamxJ60aI?t=2746">here (starting at 46:00 or so)</a>.</p>

  <p>While he was working on a project to get <i>Doom</i> running in C++ as opposed to its original programming language, C, Waage was contacted by Georges Labrèche, a spacecraft operations engineer at the European Space Agency, about the prospect of running <i>Doom</i> on the ESA’s OP-SAT satellite.</p>

 <p>OP-SAT presented an excellent opportunity for the ESA, as an experimental platform for unique tests on a device orbiting the Earth made out of (mostly) off-the-shelf computer parts and housed in a device not much larger than a suitcase.</p> <p>After getting <i>Doom</i> to run without graphical output, as proof it could be done, the team was not only able to get actual graphics running with the game in software rendering mode, but it was also able to swap out <i>Doom</i>’s fictional skybox with real images of the Earth, processed by a machine learning algorithm to adapt to <i>Doom</i>’s strict palette limit of 256 colors. The team had to tweak the color palette a bit to allow for more than <i>Doom</i> usually does, but the results worked. Not only did <i>Doom</i> run in space, but it ran in space while using a skybox featuring images taken by the very satellite it was running on.</p> <p>So yes, <i>Doom</i> has run on everything and everywhere, including a satellite in space.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/the-game-awards-needs-a-puzzle-category.1342156/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Why is the old<em> Path of Exile</em> more popular than the sequel right now? How does co-op horror game Mimesis copy teammates’ voices? And what’s the real difference between a remake and remaster these days? It’s the latest edition of Morning Checkpoint, <em>Kotaku</em>‘s daily roundup of gaming news and culture. Digital Foundry has a new retro gaming podcast. It’s very good and you should <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DqtLH0MOkgI">go check it out</a>.</p> <h2>Where are all the puzzle award categories for games?</h2> <p>It’s a question bubbled up across my feed <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/edmondtran.bsky.social/post/3m4pq7uz5yk2m">over the weekend</a>. The Game Awards has genre shout-outs for role-playing games, action games, and even family games, whatever that means (it’s usually shorthand for whatever Nintendo put out that year). But other popular genres like horror and even shooters don’t get any special consideration. With puzzle games, that short shrift feels especially acute, however.</p>

 <p>That’s because there are lots of great puzzle games lately that just don’t usually have a shot of winning Best Game or the indie categories they’re otherwise most often represented in, like “Games for Impact.” A puzzle category in 2025 would be full of strong contenders, including Blue Prince, <em>The Roottress are Dead</em>, and the recently launched <a href="https://kotaku.com/super-fantasy-kingdom-seance-blake-manor-dispatch-2000640533"><em>The Séance of Blake Manor</em></a>.</p>

 <p>Even Double Fine’s excellent <em>Keeper</em> might be more likely to get an honorary mention with a best puzzle category than awkwardly shoving it into best indie game (that happens to be published by the largest game publisher in the world).</p> <h2>Fans discuss whether to boycott <em>Hyper Light Drifter</em> dev’s next game after layoffs</h2> <p>“Hard to support devs when they can no longer see a cent from a game,” wrote one user on the Steam discussion page for Possessor(s), <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/action/as-players-debate-whether-to-purchase-possessor-s-after-heart-machine-lays-off-staff-a-week-before-launch-its-creators-and-publisher-respond-as-a-developer-who-is-slated-for-lay-off-please-buy-this-game/"><em>PC Gamer</em> reports</a>. Heart Machine has undergone multiple rounds of layoffs over the last year and put its Early Access action-RPG <em>Hyper Light Breaker</em> on ice. But publisher Devolver Digital said laid off staff are still eligible for revenue sharing from the game’s sales, and “As a developer who is slated for lay off—PLEASE BUY THIS GAME,” former narrative director Tyler Hutchinson told Steam players.</p>

 <p>This same issue has come up recently with news of <a href="https://kotaku.com/gta-6-rockstar-games-union-busting-delay-2000640525">alleged union busting at Rockstar Games</a>. Some fans have immediately called for a boycott of <em>Grand Theft Auto 6</em>, despite no indication from any of the fired developers that that’s what they want to happen in response. Consumers can choose to spend their money however they want, but it’s usually good to check with the people you’re trying to support before launching a boycott in their name.</p>

 <h2>Remasters sell, but remakes sell better</h2> <p>That’s according to new research from Ampere Analysis as reported <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/consumers-spend-twice-as-much-on-video-game-remakes-than-remasters-according-to-research/">by<em> VGC</em></a>. The data firm counted 15 remakes and 27 remasters released between January 2024 and September 2025. It found that remakes generated 2.2 times the revenue of remasters, despite only being released half as often. Of course, the Ampere also counted games like <em>Oblivion Remastered</em> as, well, a remaster, even though it certainly veers more into the territory of a remake.</p>

 <h2><em>Peak</em> is getting a new Kashyyyk biome</h2>  <p>It’s called Roots. It’s full oe redwood trees. And it seems like there will be lots of spiders.</p> <h2><em>Mimesis</em> is a new co-op horror game that copies your voice</h2> <p>That’s one of the ways its enemies try to trick players into thinking they’re on the same team. It’s the latest crew-like to quietly have a big week on Steam after arriving in Early Access on October 27.</p>

 <p>“It’s pretty much a <em>Lethal Company</em> clone but with an LLM mimic feature that actually tries to make sense out of the voice clips it gets per session,” is how one user described it. There’s no generative-AI disclosure on Steam page so it’s unclear how the whole thing works.</p> <h2>The original <em>Path of Exile</em> has exploded on Steam again thanks to a new update</h2> <p>Patch 3.27 is called Keepers of the Flame and arrived on November 1. The action-RPG hit over 180,000 concurrents on Steam over the weekend after it went live. <a href="https://www.pathofexile.com/forum/view-thread/3869068">The massive update</a> focuses on an invasion of Breach Monster and includes tons of changes to skills, characters, and everything else in the game for what is essentially it’s next big season.</p> <h2>ICYMI:</h2> <ul> <li><a href="https://kotaku.com/stellar-blade-shift-up-crab-hand-small-penis-hateful-expression-apology-nikke-2000640487">The small penis pinching controversy, explained</a></li> <li><a href="https://kotaku.com/game-awards-2025-goty-race-polymarket-clair-obscur-2000640468">Nobody thinks<em> Silksong</em> has a chance at GOTY&nbsp;</a></li> <li><a href="https://kotaku.com/nintendo-switch-2-piracy-lawsuit-streamer-2000640438">Switch streamer owes Nintendo $17,500 after trying to troll them</a></li> </ul> <h2>Watch this:</h2>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><span>Ever since choice-based games moved away from dialogue options in which you see exactly what your character will say before they say it in favor of little blurbs that try to sum up the general vibe of what you’re going to say or do before you watch it unfold on-screen, there’s been a loss of clarity between what we think we’re about to say and what we actually end up doing in video games. Part of me thinks this is just the consequence of a more cinematic approach to choice-based games, but poorly communicating what a player will do when they make a decision is a game design issue, and </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/dispatch-episode-1-2-review-aaron-paul-critical-role-2000639678"><i><span>Dispatch</span></i></a><span>, the first project from AdHoc Studio, made up of several ex-Telltale developers, is one of the latest games to fall victim to this incongruity between what the screen says your characters will do and what actually ends up happening after you choose it.</span></p> <p><span>Studios have found different ways to circumvent this danger. BioWare uses emotive icons to communicate an emotional intent with different options, or has even started adding small pop-up windows to lay out exactly what you’re going to do alongside your dialogue option. However, games like </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/dragon-age-veilguard-4-review-dreadwolf-rook-action-rpg-1851681954"><i><span>Dragon Age: The Veilguard</span></i></a> <span>have the advantage of pausing dialogue to let players consider their actions before moving forward. </span><i><span>Dispatch</span></i><span>, like many of the old Telltale games, including </span><i><span>The Walking Dead </span></i><span>and </span><i><span>Tales from the Borderlands, </span></i><span>has timed dialogue choices to create a sense of urgency and keep a scene flowing. That has its advantages, but it also means you can’t include a bunch of clarifying pop-ups like other games might because players won’t have time to read them all thoroughly. That said, you can also just write dialogue options that are straightforward, rather than obfuscating what you’re actually going to do. Minor spoilers for </span><i><span>Dispatch</span></i><span>’s third</span> <span>episode follow:</span></p>

  <p><span>In episode three, protagonist Robert Robertson III is gathering his crew of ex-villain dispatchees to let them know that, by the end of their shift, at least one of them will be off the team and in the unemployment line. Exactly who that ends up being is the final decision of the episode, but before you make any such call, the group gathers in a meeting room, and Golem, a sentient pile of mud and dirt, knocks Robert to the floor as he enters the room. The player is given two options here: kick him out, or “give him the chair.” That could be interpreted as you offering him a chair to sit down on, but if you choose that option, that’s not what happens. Instead, Robert throws the chair at Golem, which lodges in his shoulder. Robert gives him a very apt talking-to about being aware of his surroundings, but the violence to get there is not clearly communicated in the options you’re given. It makes for a funny streaming moment, at least, but given Telltale’s history with these kinds of ambiguous dialogue options, folks aren’t thrilled to see these interactions return in </span><i><span>Dispatch</span></i><span>.</span></p>         <p><i><span>Dispatch </span></i><span>is halfway through its eight-episode run, and while I’m enjoying parts of it, I have been feeling a bit railroaded by its decisions thus far. I’m curious to see just how much impact those choices can make by the time the game ends later this month, but for now, it’s mostly just felt like I’ve been on the ride.</span></p>

              <p>Apple’s Mac Mini gets all the attention for compact computing but plenty of people need powerful Windows machines that don’t take up half a desk. Developers running Windows-only software, small business owners managing Microsoft ecosystems, content creators working with Adobe suites, and anyone tired of bulky tower PCs all face the same challenge: <strong>serious processing power in a tiny package that runs Windows natively</strong>.</p>
<p>The GMKtec M2 Pro S delivers exactly that: an Intel Core i7-1185G7 processor, 32GB RAM, and triple 4K display support, in a case smaller than most hardcover books. Amazon<a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5306/"> has slashed this mini PC from $639 to $409, placing legitimate desktop-class performance within reach at a price</a> that makes sense.</p>

<h2>Tiger Lake Performance in a Desktop Form Factor</h2>
<p>Intel’s Tiger Lake is its 11th generation of Core i7 mobile chips but GMKtec adapted <strong>the Core i7-1185G7 chip for use in desktop mini PCs with great results</strong>. This quad-core chip runs at a base frequency of 3.0 GHz and turbos up to 4.8 GHz on single-core workloads with all four cores sustaining 4.3 GHz under full load. Those frequencies matter: They’re a determinant of how snappy your applications respond, how well your video-editing software scrubs through timelines, and how many browser tabs you can have open before things start crawling. Eight threads through Hyper-Threading technology allow the processor to juggle multiple tasks simultaneously.</p>



<p>It’s handled by the Intel Iris Xe Graphics with 96 execution units that deliver performance well above older integrated graphics and give even some entry-level dedicated GPUs a run for their money. That matters from smooth <strong>desktop animations to hardware-accelerated video encoding, plus casual gaming</strong> and the ability to run design software without throwing hundreds of dollars at a separate graphics card</p>
<p>The 32GB of dual-channel DDR4 RAM comes properly configured from the factory, and gives both the CPU and GPU maximum memory bandwidth for the best performance. Dual-channel operation essentially doubles the speed at which data flows between RAM and processor compared to single-channel configurations, eliminating a common bottleneck that cripples many budget systems. The 1TB NVMe SSD connects via PCIe 3.0, delivering read speeds around 3,500 MB/s that make your entire system feel instantaneous compared to old SATA drives or mechanical hard drives.</p>



<p>The triple display capability transforms this mini PC into a serious multitasking powerhouse: <strong>Two HDMI 2.0 ports</strong> each output 4K resolution at 60Hz, while the <strong>USB-C port with DisplayPort</strong> alt mode handles the third 4K display at 60Hz. <strong>Running three 4K monitors simultaneously</strong> gives you over 24 million pixels of workspace, letting traders monitor multiple markets, developers keep code on one screen with documentation and testing on the others, or video editors spread their timeline across displays. The <strong>60Hz refresh rate</strong> ensures smooth motion and responsive cursor movement.</p>
<p>The GMKtec mini PC now costs $409, instead of $639, which makes it far cheaper than many standalone processors.</p>

              <p>Working on a single laptop screen is like trying to prepare a five-course meal in a studio apartment kitchen: constant minimizing of windows, lost tracking of tabs, and clicking back and forth between applications until your wrist hurts from all the mouse movement. There’s a great laptop screen extender on sale at Amazon that solves this by adding two full 14-inch displays that clip right onto your laptop, instantly creating a triple-screen setup: <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5305/">Amazon has dropped it from $239 to $189 which makes this the cheapest route into serious screen real estate</a> without buying separate monitors and dealing with all that cabling.</p>

<h2>Professional Display Quality in a Portable Package</h2>
<p>Each <strong>14-inch screen delivers full HD 1080P resolution through IPS panel technology</strong>&nbsp;which means you get consistent colors and clear text from almost any viewing angle. That’s where IPS panels make all the difference; they avoid that annoying color shift and brightness drop you get from cheaper TN screens just from tilting your head a little. The 1920×1080 resolution gives you enough pixel density to keep text sharp and images detailed without having that fuzzy look budget monitors often suffer from. <strong>Both displays boast blue light filtering technology</strong> that reduces eye strain during long work sessions. That means it cuts the harsh blue wavelengths that mess with your sleep cycle and tire your eyes. The <strong>anti-glare coating scatters ambient light</strong> instead of reflecting it straight back at you so you can actually see what’s on screen even when sitting near windows or under office lighting.</p>
<p>Built-in speakers mean you get audio from the extended displays without needing separate speakers or relying on your laptop’s often mediocre sound system. At just <strong>0.24 inches thick, these screens fold flat for transport</strong> and barely add bulk to your laptop bag.</p>



<p>The connectivity covers all the bases <strong>with two USB Type-C ports and one HDMI to USB-C port</strong>, which gives you flexibility in how you connect depending on what your laptop offers. Plug and play means exactly that-no driver downloads, no software installations, just connect the cables and your operating system immediately recognizes the extra displays. You can run both screens in extended mode to genuinely expand your workspace or switch into mirror mode for presentations where you want everyone seeing the same content. <strong>The triple-screen configuration legitimately increases your visible workspace by 200%</strong>, and lets you keep email open on one screen, your primary work on the laptop display and reference materials or chat windows on the third screen.</p>
<p>This extender <strong>works with Windows, macOS, and Linux operating systems</strong> and supports game consoles like PlayStation, Xbox, and Switch to extend your game into multiple displays.</p>



<p>Studies regularly demonstrate that using a <strong>dual monitor setup increases productivity 20-42% over using a single screen</strong> and the gains are even higher when adding a third screen. This gain in productivity is realized by reduced window switching, better visibility for information, and the ability to retain tools, references, and communications visible all at once.</p>
<p>At $189, this extender is less than the cost of buying even one decent standalone portable monitor, yet you get two screens plus mounting hardware and all the necessary cables.</p>
