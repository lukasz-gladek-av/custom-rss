              <p>One of <a href="https://kotaku.com/intergalactic-heretic-prophet-naughty-dog-ps5-actors-1851722128">the biggest surprises at 2024’s trailer-fest The Game Awards</a> was a brand new game from&nbsp;<em>The Last of Us</em> creators Naughty Dog, a sci-fi action-adventure called&nbsp;<a href="https://kotaku.com/intergalactic-the-heretic-prophet-naughty-dog-trailer-1851720900"><em>Intergalactic: The Heretic Prophet</em></a>. Being the first new property from the developer in 12 years, there was good reason to sit up and take notice. Except, following that initial reveal, there was nothing to take notice of. A year later, tipsters are advising us not to get our hopes up for this year’s Geoff-Fest, given the game is very unlikely to be seen.</p> <p>That reveal last year was so compelling. Central character Jordan A. Mun was instantly very appealing, her misanthropic approach to space travel seemingly a result of the falling apart of her previous band of criminals, the Five Aces, as she now appeared to be hunting them all down. Of course, the trailer was also met with a vicious and deeply pathetic backlash from the remaining denizens of X who cannot tolerate the existence of a female video game protagonist who isn’t there for them to fap over before crying themselves to sleep. But idiots aside, it showed truly wonderful acting from Tati Gabrielle as Jordan, and potential for more of the exquisite storytelling that Naughty Dog is known for. If we can just ignore the excruciating ads for Porsche and Adidas.</p>

  <p>But since last November, we’ve not heard a peep, other than just how far away we are from getting this game. In September this year, <a href="https://kotaku.com/intergalactic-heretic-prophet-neil-druckmann-last-us-part-3-hbo-2000624967">game director Neil Druckmann spoke to&nbsp;<em>Variety</em></a> and mentioned that the game is in full development, but spoke of&nbsp;<em>Intergalactic</em>‘s massive scope and budget, suggesting this was nothing imminent. And in the last couple of days, the likes of <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GamingLeaksAndRumours/comments/1p3zwoe/comment/nq8f5f9/">Jason Schreier</a> and <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/grubb.wtf/post/3m6ajw5exkk2p">Jeff Grubb</a> have been telling people that there’s no chance of seeing the game before 2027. (Thanks&nbsp;<a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/naughty-dogs-intergalactic-the-heretic-prophet-reportedly-still-years-from-release-and-dont-expect-to-see-it-at-the-game-awards"><em>IGN</em></a>.)</p>

 <p>Grubb went further, posting to BlueSky that not only is the game likely a couple of years away, but also that “it will not be shown at The Game Awards.”</p>   <p>They were responding to a rumor that spread from an <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/intergalactic-the-heretic-prophet-2026-release-report/"><em>Insider Gaming</em> article</a>, citing a&nbsp;recent episode of the Dan Allen Gaming podcast, in which former IGN editor and podcast host Colin Moriarty said he&nbsp;“believe[d]” the game would appear at The Game Awards, and called <em>Intergalactic</em> “content complete.” “I think next year it’ll be good to go,” he said, explaining that he had heard from people who’d “interacted with the game,” and based on Naughty Dog hiring for localization.</p> <div role="listitem" aria-roledescription="message" data-qa-hover="true" data-qa="virtual-list-item" data-qa-unprocessed="false" data-qa-placeholder="false" id="message-list_1763995661.805549" tabindex="-1" aria-setsize="-1" data-item-key="1763995661.805549"> <p>This inspired others to jump in and suggest the complete opposite, with Moriarty himself saying they were just personal speculation. But if we know anything in 2025, it’s that big games take <em>forever</em> to make, with colossal budgets and enormous scope meaning entire businesses ride or die on their individual success. <em>Intergalactic</em> will appear when it’s good and ready, no matter how frustrating that might be for us as we impatiently wait for more details.</p> </div>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/grand-theft-auto-6-union-firing-rockstar-protests-2000646881</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/grand-theft-auto-6-rockstar-fired-union-workers-legal-2000643030"><span>Rockstar fired 34 developers back in October</span></a><span>. While Rockstar claims these </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/gta-6-rockstar-games-union-busting-delay-2000640525"><span>people were fired for “gross misconduct</span></a><span>” over allegedly sharing company secrets, the former employees claim the company was union-busting. Now, according to a new </span><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8TvWNFBBwuY"><i><span>People Make Games</span></i></a> <span>report, the entire saga actually started after Rockstar started cracking down on developers communicating about non-work topics in the company Slack.</span></p> <p><i><span>People Make Games </span></i><span>posted a new video that includes alleged messages from the Rockstar union workers’ private Discord server where members discussed conditions at the studio, but specifically not the status of projects like the </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/gta-6-grand-theft-auto-vi-delayed-november-rockstar-games-2000641787"><span>recently delayed </span><i><span>Grand Theft Auto 6</span></i></a><span>. One former Rockstar employee claimed the only company information that was shared there were emails about updates to the company’s Slack guidelines following discussions in recently shut down channels.</span></p>

 <p><span>In October, Rockstar reportedly made changes to the company’s Slack, which included removing several miscellaneous channels where employees discussed non-work topics like pets, hobbies, and games they were playing. The “Slack Purge,” as it was called, prompted discussions in an outside union channel on Discord. This was then followed by another change preventing people from using emojis in their Slack statuses, which workers theorized was to prevent people from using the Palestinian flag or the Sprout emoji used to symbolize Union support.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><span>These emails were sent outside of work hours, and Rockstar has systems set up so workers cannot access their work email outside of their office. As such, Union members sent these emails to the Discord so people outside of the office could see their contents, which led to one member of the Discord expressing their concerns to management about the discussions. </span><i><span>PMG</span></i><span> theorizes that Rockstar gained access to the Discord at this point and read the previous chat logs to make a case for firing 34 workers by the end of that month.</span></p>

 <p><span>You can watch the full video below:</span></p>  <p>Rockstar limiting workers’ email access may have started this entire mess, but as&nbsp;<em>People Make Games&nbsp;</em>explains, the company has been the subject of several high profile leaks over the years, including a <a href="https://kotaku.com/gtavi-gta-vi-gta-6-grand-theft-auto-leak-video-dump-1849550414">massive data dump of unfinished <em>Grand Theft Auto 6&nbsp;</em>assets and footage back in 2022</a>. So it’s not entirely surprising that the studio has a lot of internal communications on lock and key to prevent leaks. That being said, as the IWGB Game Workers Union lays out in the video, discussing your working conditions is not the same as freely posting&nbsp;<em>Grand Theft Auto VI&nbsp;</em>footage on a Discord server, and should fall under protected union discussions.</p> <p>In the weeks since Rockstar fired these workers, those affected have been holding protests outside both Rockstar and publisher Take Two’s London offices. Despite being fired, several members have expressed a desire to come back and finish working on&nbsp;<em>Grand Theft Auto 6</em>, which is still a year away after its recent delay.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>The Galaxy Watch 7 is currently <strong>ranked #1 as Amazon’s Best Seller in smartwatches</strong>, ahead of all Apple Watch models. Sales are skyrocketing on Black Friday, with one simple truth: value trumps brand loyalty when the price is right. This <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5766/">2024 model is down to nearly half price at $129 from its original $249 (48% off)</a>. You’re taking here zero risk on a smartwatch that thousands are buying.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5766/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Galaxy AI That Understands Your Body</h2>
<p>It uses <strong>Galaxy AI analysis to calculate your physical readiness</strong> every morning. The watch builds up data on yesterday’s activity, quality of sleep, variation in heart rate, and recovery measures. Your phone then processes the information overnight and gives you a personalized score that lets you know how hard to push today. Low energy days indicate lighter workouts or rest, while high scores show your body is ready for intense training.</p>
<p><strong>Heart rate monitoring gets a serious boost from Galaxy AI</strong> filtering that takes into consideration the movement of the body. Conventional optical sensors are hardly accurate during high-intensity exercises when your arm is always in motion. The Galaxy Watch 7 introduces sophisticated algorithms that separate your actual heart rate signal from motion artifacts. You get reliable readings during high-intensity intervals, running, cycling, and strength training. This kind of accuracy matters when you’re training in specific heart rate zones or monitoring cardiovascular health.</p>



<p>Detailed analysis of sleep stages and quality goes beyond basic time-in-bed measurement. The watch tracks your sleep cycles throughout the night, monitoring light sleep, deep sleep, and REM phases of your sleep. Galaxy AI analyzes this data and gives you meaningful insights into your sleep patterns and habits. This feature screens for moderate to severe sleep apnea that may need medical attention. And you also get personalized recommendations to improve the quality of sleep based on your sleep patterns.</p>
<p>Wellness tips provide <strong>personalized recommendations that adjust to your real behavior and objectives</strong>. Your watch tracks detailed health information all day and night. Your connected phone then uses Galaxy AI to create relevant tips from those insights. Recommendations may include adjusting the time you work out, drinking more water, or going to bed earlier. Advice changes as your habits change and you receive coaching that remains pertinent to your life</p>
<p>Performance tracking lets you compare current workouts to previous efforts in real-time. Running the same route? The watch shows whether you’re ahead or behind your last pace. Cycling your regular loop? See instantly if you’re improving or struggling today. It’s this type of comparative data which encourages you to push that little bit harder or helps you realize when your body might need recovery.</p>



<p>The <strong>40mm case size fits comfortably on smaller wrists</strong> without looking oversized. The Green colorway provides a fresh alternative to standard black and silver options. Battery life reaches approximately <strong>30 hours with typical use</strong>, covering a full day plus some buffer. Charging happens via the included wireless charger that snaps magnetically to the back. <strong>Water resistance up to 5ATM</strong> protects during swimming, showering, and sweaty workouts.</p>
<p>The <strong>touchscreen display stays readable in bright sunlight</strong> and dims automatically in darkened rooms. Rotating bezel navigation comes with tactile control that works with sweaty or gloved fingers. From minimalist time displays to data-rich fitness dashboards, watch faces can be customized as needed. Notification mirroring from your phone keeps you connected without constantly needing to check your device. The <strong>watch works both with Android and iOS</strong>, though Android users get deeper integration features.</p>
<p>The Samsung Galaxy Watch 7 provides AI-powered health tracking at almost half the retail price this Black Friday for $129. This happens to be the #1 best-selling smartwatch on Amazon because the feature-to-price ratio finally makes sense. Want comprehensive health tracking without paying Apple Watch prices? This record-low deal takes every excuse off the table.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/apple-breaks-its-own-pricing-rules-airpods-max-hits-a-wild-black-friday-low-2000646662</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/apple-breaks-its-own-pricing-rules-airpods-max-hits-a-wild-black-friday-low.1362778/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Discounts on Apple’s products are few and far between. This is true for both the latest releases and most older generation models that still perform well. But thanks to Black Friday and Cyber Monday, that changes today.</p>
<p>Even though the events are technically still a few days away, early deals have started popping it. There’s a wide range of items to grab, from tech essentials to kitchen appliances, games, outdoor gear, and even toys! We also just spotted Apple AirPods Max — one of the best wireless headphones out there — at a discount.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5865/">These headphones usually sit at $550, but they can be yours for $430 today. That’s after a sweet 22% discount.</a> The offer applies to blue, orange, starlight, and purple color options. Those after the classic black version can grab it for $479. There are no weirdly long coupon codes or complicated checkout processes to worry about. Just add the product to your cart, and the discount applies automatically. Prime members will also enjoy free shipping on their orders.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5865/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Pro-Level Active Noise Cancellation</h2>
<p>The headphones don’t just look good; they are comfortable to wear, too. The pair is designed with a knit-mesh canopy and memory foam ear cushions that fit nicely to seal the sound in. Unlike most over-ear headphones, these don’t apply unnecessary pressure to the ears, which means you can wear them for longer without feeling uneasy.</p>
<p>Carring them around safely won’t be a problem either, thanks to the color-matched smart case that’s included in the box for free. Plus, since there are multiple fresh colors to choose from, you can pick one that suits your aesthetics the best. Like your audio gear a bit on the minimal side? The black or starlight options can be a great pick. Want something with a bit more personality? The purple version is stunning!</p>
<p>Performance-wise, these are packed with a dynamic driver and the Apple H1 chip for rich, high-fidelity audio. There’s Active Noise Cancellation that blocks all background sound for a more immersive experience, even in noisy, chaotic settings. This feature is great for when you really want to focus on a task (or vibe to a track) without any distractions. Just put these on, and block the outside world for as long as you want.</p>



<p>Of course, that doesn’t work for every situation. Sometimes, it’s better to be aware of what’s happening around you. For that, you’ve got the Transparency mode. This one lets ambient sound in while still delivering deep, quality audio. You can enjoy what’s playing, plus stay in touch with the world. This mode is best when you’re travelling and don’t want to miss your stop, or when you’re in a cafe and want to hear the barista call your name.</p>
<p>Spatial Audio is supported, too. This mode pushes sound that suits your unique ear shape for a 3D experience. The headphones are also smart enough to pause the audio automatically when you take them off! Tweaking other settings doesn’t require pulling your phone out, either. You can adjust volume, mute yourself on calls, skip tracks, and more using the digital crown right there on the headphones.</p>
<p>Pairing these with your device is straightforward. You can place the headphones near your iPhone, iPad, or Mac, and just tap Connect on the screen to get started.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5865/">The current deal brings the price of this high-end pair to $430.</a> We know it’s still a bit of an investment, but the discount somewhat makes these a bit more approachable. If you’ve been wanting to grab premium headphones from Apple for less, today is the day to make the move.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/samsung-gives-no-mercy-to-apple-galaxy-s25-ultra-hits-record-low-while-iphone-stays-overpriced-2000646829</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Both storage variants of the Galaxy S25 Ultra have <strong>crashed to all-time low prices</strong> on Amazon for Black Friday: The <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4640/">256GB model drops from $1,299 to $949</a>, while the <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4640/">512GB version falls from $1,419 to $1,019</a>. With these prices well undercutting Samsung’s own website, Amazon is the clear winner on this flagship purchase. At these lower prices, the S25 Ultra competes with the iPhone 17 Pro, and many would argue Samsung gives you more features for less cash.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4640/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Best Smartphone</h2>
<p>The screen of the <strong>6.8-inch Dynamic AMOLED 2X runs at a native 3088 x 1440 resolution</strong> with adaptive <strong>refresh rates from 1Hz to 120Hz</strong>. Lowering its refresh rate to 1Hz while displaying static images, this screen dynamically adjusts its refresh rate depending upon content; it ramps up to 120Hz in the case of gaming and scrolling. The peak brightness goes up to 2600 nits for great outdoor visibility even under direct sunlight. This <strong>display supports HDR10+</strong> for stunning color reproduction in compatible content. It also has the toughened Gorilla Glass Victus 3 to protect it against scratches and drops with undiminished touch sensitivity.</p>
<p>The <strong>Snapdragon 8 Elite for Galaxy chip</strong> represents the most powerful mobile silicon currently available. This custom variant happens to run slightly faster than the standard Snapdragon 8 Elite in other flagship phones. The octa-core architecture handles demanding games and 4K video editing, and heavy multitasking without breaking a sweat. AI processing happens locally on the device through dedicated neural processing cores.</p>



<p><strong>Battery capacity reaches 5000mAh</strong> to provide all-day endurance even for demanding users. This efficient processor and adaptive display work together to make the most of your day. <strong>Fast 45W charging takes the phone from zero to 65% in about 30 minutes</strong>. Wireless charging at 15W offers cable-free convenience when at a desk or nightstand. You will be able to top up Galaxy Buds or a friend’s phone by merely placing them on the back of your S25 Ultra with reverse wireless charging.</p>
<p>The camera system consists of a <strong>quad-lens setup that competes with independent cameras</strong>: The primary 200MP wide sensor captures exceptional detail that can be used for aggressive cropping without losing quality. A 50MP periscope telephoto delivers 5x optical zoom on subjects far away. The secondary telephoto provides 3x optical zoom for portraits and shots in the middle distance; it has a resolution of 10MP. The 12MP ultra-wide captures wide-screen shots with a field of view up to 120 degrees.</p>
<p>Video capabilities <strong>encompass 8K recording at 30fps or 4K at 60fps with exceptional stabilization</strong>. Super Steady video mode removes shake during walking or running. Director’s View lets one see all camera angles simultaneously and seamlessly switch between views when recording. Pro video controls give filmmakers manual exposure, focus, and audio level adjustments.</p>
<p>The <strong>built-in S Pen</strong> turns this phone into a productivity powerhouse: Taking handwritten notes feels natural on the responsive stylus, feeling like pen-on-paper feedback. Annotate screenshots, sign documents, and even sketch out your next idea without needing any extra accessories. The pen stores inside the phone body, where it is always ready should inspiration strike.</p>
<p>Starting at $949 for 256GB or $1,019 for 512GB, Galaxy S25 Ultra offers flagship performance that has never been this affordable on Black Friday. If you want the best Android phone available, period, these record-low prices finally make the premium features accessible.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/dji-neo-mini-drone-reaches-its-lowest-price-that-makes-it-easier-than-ever-to-pick-up-this-black-friday-2000646001</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/dji-neo-mini-drone-reaches-its-lowest-price-that-makes-it-easier-than-ever-to-pick-up-this-black-friday.1362733/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Comparing today’s drones to the ones from just 10 short years ago isn’t&nbsp;<em>quite</em> like comparing a MacBook to the UNIVAC, but the differences are truly incredible. One of the best examples of how drones have become infinitesimally smaller, more user-friendly, and priced for everyone is the <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5864/">DJI Neo, a palm-sized 0.3-pound wonder that’s a terrific early Black Friday deal at just $159 at Amazon.&nbsp;</a></p>
<p>What the DJI Neo does best is something its ancient ancestors from 2015 could never even dream of doing — AI-powered subject tracking that allows it to follow you and keep you in frame while you’re in motion, all while shooting 4K Ultra HD video and somehow not crashing into anything. Unlike its predecessors that were mainly geared toward big sweeping landscape shots — and only after you mastered the art of flying it — the Neo accomplishes all of its many fun photographic features while not even requiring a remote control.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5864/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Long-Haul Flight</h2>
<p>The DJI Neo has 18 minutes of flight time per battery charge, which gives you ample time to have it follow and shoot amazingly stable 4K Ultra HD video of you or another subject, hover or circle for beautiful group photos, or go on fast acrobatic flights that result in amazing action videos.</p>
<p>Getting started with the Neo could not be easier. Take it in your palm, press the mode button to select how you want to shoot (including Circle mode where the drone orbits you at a fixed altitude to shoot amazing 360-degree video, among other great action modes), and it takes off from your hand. When it’s done, it returns and lands in your hand. It has built-in guards for its four propellers to protect both your hands and the drone itself, and also to make indoor flight and shoots an option.</p>



<h2>Tag, Shoot, Enjoy</h2>
<p>The Neo is incredibly easy to control, and by many methods. Add the DJI Fly app to your smartphone and the Neo becomes a voice-controlled flyer that responds to spoken flight directives. The app can also be used as a remote, with virtual joysticks appearing on the screen and point-of-view images from the Neo’s camera. If you’re locked into the idea of a remote, DJI’s RC-N3 Remote Controller (sold separately) will do the trick.</p>
<p>Our favorite potential method of flight control? DJI’s Goggles (either the 3 or the N3) combined with the RC Motion 3 or FPV Remote Controller 3. They’re all sold separately, and you’ll probably want to wait until you totally have the hang of flying the Neo, but the goggles are an incredible and immersive experience where you feel like you’re the one flying. The Neo is also able to transmit video from up to 10 kilometers, so there are virtually no limits on your flight range.</p>
<p>It can be a little unnerving to see the tiny Neo fly out of your sightline, but the Return to Home command can be delivered to the drone via app (or by hand motion if it’s close to you), with failsafe navigation that brings it home safely.</p>
<p>The DJI Neo is an incredible holiday gift option thanks to its virtually limitless possibilities for creating amazing videos, its ease of use, and <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5864/">its even more accessible than usual price of just $159 during this Amazon pre-Black Friday Deal.&nbsp;</a></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Sonos has earned its reputation as the <strong>premium choice in home audio</strong> through years of engineering excellence and ecosystem refinement. The Beam soundbar (now second generation) is their <strong>most accessible entry point into high-quality soundbar</strong> territory, and it punches well above its weight class.</p>
<p>At <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5728/">$349, down from $499, this Dolby Atmos soundbar has hit an all-time low price on Amazon</a> for Black Friday. Competing soundbars from Samsung and Bose struggle to match the combination of sound quality, features, and ecosystem integration that Sonos delivers at this price point.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5728/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Dolby Atmos That Makes a Difference</h2>
<p><strong>Dolby Atmos’ 3D surround sound effect</strong> creates an immersive audio experience that will totally change movie nights. Height channels bounce the sound off your ceiling to create overhead effects during action sequences and atmospheric moments. Helicopters fly over your head, rain falls from above, and explosions surround you from every side. The Beam Gen 2 achieves <strong>this spatial audio through psychoacoustic processing</strong> and some seriously clever speaker placement inside the compact bar.</p>
<p><strong>Crystal clear dialogue reproduction</strong> ensures you never miss the important conversations or plot details. This is ensured by a dedicated center channel that focuses on vocal frequencies carrying speech. Background music and sound effects stay separated from dialogue, avoiding the muddy mix that plagues cheaper soundbars. You can finally stop reaching for the remote to adjust the volume when scenes switch between quiet dialogue and loud action.</p>



<p>The bass performance is well above expectations for such a compact soundbar: The lively low-end adds weight to movie soundtracks and music playback without overwhelming other frequencies. You feel the rumble of engines and the thump of music bass lines. The bass stays tight and controlled rather than boomy or muddy. Many users find the bass output sufficient without adding a separate subwoofer, though Sonos makes it easy to expand later if desired.</p>
<p>The Sonos app is your key to intuitively<strong> controlling all your audio settings and streaming services</strong>. You’ll tweak EQ settings, manage multiple Sonos speakers across your home, and access music from dozens of streaming services. Music streaming works independently when the TV is off, turning your soundbar into a capable music speaker. Radio, podcasts, and audiobooks all play through that superior sound system you’ve already installed for your TV.</p>



<p>Set up is simple, requiring just two cables: <strong>one to your TV via HDMI and one to a power outlet</strong>. A single HDMI ARC or eARC connection for audio input to the soundbar also enables TV remote control pass-through. Control volume and power with your existing TV remote; no programming or separate controls are required. Apple AirPlay 2 support lets you stream directly from iPhones and iPads.</p>
<p>At $349, the Sonos Beam Gen 2 is offering high-end soundbar performance for 30% off retail this Black Friday. None of the competing Samsung or Bose soundbars at this price offer the complete package you’re getting here from Sonos.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/fire-tv-soundbar-just-hit-a-black-friday-price-only-possible-when-amazon-doesnt-care-about-margin-2000646675</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/fire-tv-soundbar-just-hit-a-black-friday-price-only-possible-when-amazon-doesn%E2%80%99t-care-about-margin.1362703/</guid>

              <p>You can’t really enjoy your favorite TV shows and movies on visuals alone; you need solid sound to match. Unfortunately, most screens don’t come with quality speakers, which can really take away from the overall experience. No one likes having to rewind just to hear dialogues properly or deal with distorted sound at higher volumes.</p>
<p>Thankfully, you don’t have to put up with that. A quick (and affordable) solution to this is to grab yourself a soundbar. Amazon makes some of our favorites out there, and you can now bring one home without paying the full price!</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5862/">Thanks to Black Friday, the retailer has dropped the price of its very own Fire TV Soundbar to just $85, after a nice $35 off its retail price.</a> This is the lowest we have seen in 90 days, which means it didn’t even drop this low during the October Prime Day. The offer can be grabbed by both Prime and non-Prime members. But keep in mind, early BF deals tend to wrap up fast. If you’ve been looking for a reliable sound solution to add to your entertainment setup, now is a good time to make the move.</p>

<h2>Three-Dimensional Virtual Surround Sound</h2>
<p>Like most Fire TV soundbars, this too comes in a no-fuss, compact build. There’s nothing too crazy going on with the design; just a bar with a few minimal buttons at the top. It can blend into any setup without bringing too much attention to itself. Place it on your console or mount it on the wall using enclosed mounting rings for a cleaner setup, whichever you prefer.</p>
<p>As for the performance, it offers DTS Virtual:X technology to deliver full, three-dimensional virtual audio that fills the room. Audio won’t just be blasted from where the soundbar is placed, but will come from all directions. Footsteps feel like they’re coming from behind, whispers creep up, and cars race past your couch. Best of all, the output even includes a height dimension for overhead atmospheric effects; exactly what you experience in a cinema.</p>
<p>Then there’s Dolby Audio support that offers richer bass and clearer dialogue for tracks, movies, and games. The soundbar can also be used as a Bluetooth speaker for vibing to your favorite songs or listening to podcasts in the background as you finish house chores. It can connect to your smartphone or tablet via Bluetooth within seconds!</p>



<p>Setting things up and getting started is simple. All you need to do is plug in the power cord in the soundbar, and connect the included HDMI cable to your TV’s eARC/ARC port. Hit the power button on your remote to turn the screen on. Your audio output will now instantly switch from the TV speakers to your new soundbar. As simple as that.</p>
<p>The Fire TV Soundbar works well with almost all smart TVs and streaming media players. Those using a Fire TV can use a single remote to control both their devices.</p>
<p>The box comes with the soundbar itself, a remote, an HDMI cable, and a wall mounting kit. That’s everything you need to get started right away.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5862/">To wrap it up, you can now grab this powerful, efficient soundbar for just $85, after a 29% discount.</a> You’re saving $35 on it. We don’t expect the price to drop any further during the main event, so it’s best to grab the deal right now. Looking for more such smart devices? Amazon is offering plenty of its top-rated devices at up to 50% off, so there’s a lot more to browse.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/dispatch-adhoc-studios-interview-sales-2-million-humor-2000646848</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/what-dispatch%E2%80%99s-devs-hope-the-industry-learns-and-doesn%E2%80%99t-learn-from-its-success.1362700/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/dispatch-review-adhoc-studios-all-8-episodes-finale-2000644106"><i><span>Dispatch</span></i></a><span>, AdHoc Studio’s superhero workplace comedy, is an indisputable hit. The team led by ex-Telltale devs has announced that the episodic adventure game has reached </span><a href="https://x.com/theAdHocStudio/status/1991235043868410096"><span>2 million players</span></a><span> as of this week, and has become a viral sensation for streamers and content creators. The game’s success flies in the face of claims that narrative adventure games have gone out of style. So what does AdHoc hope the industry learns from its success? Conversely, what do they hope developers </span><i><span>don’t</span></i><span> take away from it? These are some of the things we asked when we sat down with co-directors Dennis Lenart and Chris Rebbert.</span></p> <p><span>According to Lenart, the simplest reason for the game’s success is that “people still enjoy good narrative games.” Rebbert expanded upon this by pointing out that simplicity and ease of access have become so rare in games that something refreshingly straightforward like </span><i><span>Dispatch </span></i><span>is offering an experience many players want but often have a hard time finding in today’s market.</span></p>

 <p><span>“I play some free-to-play games and stuff like that, but I feel like I get on so many games now, and it’s like I have to download an update every time I get on, and I have to pay for any extra thing,” Rebbert said. “I think when we talk about our favorite games, we always talk about, ‘I just want a linear experience. I don’t want to come jump in and compete.’ And not to say those experiences shouldn’t be available for those who enjoy them, but I feel like a lot of people would like to have experiences like this, where they can just jump in and have a personal singular or linear playthrough or whatever it might be that is uninhibited by microtransactions and stuff like that, you know.”</span></p>

 <p><span>Rebbert also pointed to </span><i><span>Dispatch</span></i><span>’s consistent release schedule, which made each episode a weekly event for fans, in contrast with the old Telltale games or the early </span><i><span>Life Is Strange </span></i><span>games, which launched sporadically over several months. </span><i><span>Dispatch</span></i><span>’s regular cadence allowed AdHoc to own a few weeks of mindshare.</span></p>

 <p><span>“I was talking to Natalie [Herman], our producer, about it yesterday, and it was just like, ‘How often do you have, like, those moments of anticipation anymore, you know?’” he added. “Because most TV shows even get dumped on a streaming platform, and people watch them at their leisure. You don’t have this cultural anticipation in conversation; that was really nice. We were witnessing it more than participating in it. I got increasingly excited to jump on and watch streamers on those days. It was cool to see people get increasingly excited for the next drop. I haven’t seen, culturally, that happen in a long time, and it’s cool that it was successful.”</span></p>

 <p><span>While it all worked out in the end, Lenart says that </span><i><span>Dispatch </span></i><span>felt like a gamble throughout its development. He thinks the team’s belief in the project, despite outside insistence that single-player narrative adventures were a dying genre, helped them push through their doubts.</span></p>

 <p><span>“There were several points along the way where things [felt] destined to fall apart for this kind of game coming out in this specific time in this market,” Lenart said. “At every step of the way, I feel like the team pulled together and just made something happen where we didn’t think it was possible to make it happen. So it is definitely a credit to everyone at the studio for continuing to believe in the project, from the early days when it was an idea that we didn’t know if anyone would like, except for us, all the way through the final details and the final push to get out into the world. So it’s, it is really gratifying to me to be able to see the team enjoy the success that the game is having and see the little details that they put in and contributed, called back in memes. It’s just fun.”</span></p>

 <p><span>On the other hand, it’s always possible that something will blow up and some C-suite executive will completely misread why it took off. For </span><i><span>Dispatch</span></i><span>, Rebbert and Lenart say they don’t want people to aimlessly try to </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/dispatch-episode-5-best-bar-scene-song-prism-thot-squad-2000645192"><span>emulate the game’s raunchy sense of humor</span></a><span>. Rebbert says that nudity and curse words are not a silver bullet for success if they’re not pulled off with “taste and dramatic weight.” Lenart says that the more irreverent side of </span><i><span>Dispatch</span></i><span> came about later in development, and the original draft was much more reserved and comparable to </span><i><span>The Office </span></i><span>meets </span><i><span>Ted Lasso</span></i><span>.</span></p> <p><span>“In all of the stories that we classically tell as a team of collaborators, the scenes that are the most exciting to us are people sitting around a couch or a table talking,” Lenart said. “All of the visual flair or some things that people might think are gratuitous, all of that is sort of flavoring that gets peppered in the story and the characters where they’re at in the moment. It’s not the thing we start with. I definitely think there are some IP out there that start with ‘How do we get the crazy thing or the insane image? What’s going to be the shock value thing? Then let’s stitch that piece together into the story.’ We’re the exact opposite.”</span></p> <p><span>All eight episodes of </span><i><span>Dispatch </span></i><span>are available now on PC and PlayStation 5.</span></p>
