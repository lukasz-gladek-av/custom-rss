              <p>Flagship iPhones and Samsung Galaxy phones rule the premium space, but OnePlus challenges both with specs that match, if not outpace, most of their offerings at significantly lower costs. OnePlus 13 has a real shot at going head-to-head with the iPhone 17 and Galaxy S25 and offers flagship performance without that flagship price tag.</p>
<p>Amazon <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5808/">dropped the 256GB model to $699 for Black Friday, down from its usual $899</a>, which is <strong>an all-time low</strong> that makes this Samsung and Apple rival affordable.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5808/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Industry-Leading Performance</h2>
<p>The <strong>Snapdragon 8 Elite is Qualcomm’s high-end chipset, fabricated on a 3nm node</strong>. It strikes an excellent balance between high performance and energy efficiency. It handles demanding tasks from 4K video editing to high-end gaming without any thermal throttling or slowdown. Benchmarks peg it above Apple’s A18 Pro in multi-core operations and somewhere around Apple in single-core tasks. In reality, apps open instantly, multitasking remains fluid even with several dozen apps open, and games run smoothly at the highest settings available with stable frame rates.</p>
<p>The 12GB RAM makes sure everything runs smoothly from casual use to pro workflows. You can switch between apps without reloading them, keep extensive browser sessions running, and open demanding apps together with no performance degradation. This amount of RAM is more than what the majority of its competitors offer in this price bracket, not to mention that Samsung demands a much higher price for the same amount of RAM in its S25 series.</p>



<p>The <strong>80W SUPERVOOC fast charging</strong> fills the battery from empty to full in about 30 minutes, eliminating the anxiety of low battery during busy days. You plug in during a quick break and gain hours of usage. This is much faster than the iPhone 17’s 27W and Galaxy S25’s 45W, giving the OnePlus a substantial practical advantage. The 50W AIRVOOC wireless charging brings fast charging convenience without cables, matching what flagship phones typically offer through wired connections.</p>
<p>The <strong>Hasselblad camera partnership works with color science and image processing</strong> to ensure pictures appear natural instead of oversaturated social media-ready. The primary sensor takes vivid photos in bright daylight or challenging low-light situations. The camera system features ultrawide and telephoto lenses that maintain consistent quality across focal lengths. Hasselblad’s involvement shows in the nuanced color reproduction and dynamic range that gives photos a more refined look compared to typical Android processing.</p>



<p>The<strong> 6.82-inch AMOLED display features a refresh rate of 120Hz</strong> which smooths out scrolling and makes touches super responsive. The screen brightness goes as high as 4500 nits under very particular conditions, well enough that it’s readable in direct sunlight when other phones would wash out. It supports HDR10+ for better contrast while watching compatible video content.</p>
<p><strong>OxygenOS offers a clean Android experience (our favorite)</strong> with some very useful customizations that don’t bloat the interface. It also comes with three years of major Android updates and four years of security patches, keeping your phone current and secure. Additional features include game mode, parallel apps that allow running multiple accounts, and expansive gesture controls to enhance daily usability.</p>
<p><strong>Battery life reaches a full day of heavy use</strong> with screen-on time exceeding 7 hours for most users. With the combination of efficient processor and large battery capacity, you are not hunting for chargers in the middle of the day. The phone handles heavy tasks such as navigation, video streaming, and gaming without frequent power management.</p>
<p>You get here flagship spec with Snapdragon 8 Elite and 80W charging at $699 which is $200 less than Samsung’s equivalent S25 and $300+ below the iPhone 17. Leading performance meets extremely fast charging and Hasselblad camera processing for true value that makes the traditional flagship pricing from Apple and Samsung increasingly hard to justify.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/ubisoft-ai-fps-temmates-genai-nfts-gameplay-snowdrop-reveal-2000646251</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/ubisoft-shows-off-new-ai-powered-fps-and-hopes-you%E2%80%99ve-forgotten-about-its-failed-nfts.1361176/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Despite the fact that many gamers seem to dislike or even outright hate AI-generated content in games, Ubisoft is pushing forward with it and now playtesting a shooter experiment built around AI-powered NPCs that can react to voice commands in real-time. Will it help the publisher regain some stability as it continues to struggle? I’m not sure. <a href="https://kotaku.com/we-live-in-hell-and-this-ubisoft-nft-that-requires-you-1848202326">All I can think about is the last time Ubisoft jumped on a tech fad with NFTs</a>.</p> <p><a href="https://news.ubisoft.com/en-us/article/3mWlITIuWuu0MoVuR6o8ps/ubisoft-reveals-teammates-an-ai-experiment-to-change-the-game">On November 21,</a> after <a href="https://kotaku.com/assassins-creed-black-flag-remake-ubisoft-sold-ai-2000646161">a delayed earnings call</a>, Ubisoft revealed <em>Teammates</em>, which the company refers to as its “first playable generative AI research project.” Built in the Snowdrop Engine, the same tech that powers games like <em>The Division 2</em> and<em> Star Wars Outlaws</em>, <em>Teammates</em> is a first-person shooter that includes an AI assistant named Jaspar and two AI-powered squadmates called Pablo and Sofia. Players can command these two to help them solve puzzles or engage in combat using “natural” voice commands.&nbsp; Meanwhile, Jaspar can help track missions, offer advice, and provide guidance when needed.</p>

 <p><em>Teammates</em> is built by the same team behind <a href="https://news.ubisoft.com/en-us/article/5qXdxhshJBXoanFZApdG3L/how-ubisofts-new-generative-ai-prototype-changes-the-narrative-for-npcs">Ubisoft’s Neo NPCs</a>, which the company showed off in 2024 at GDC. The main goal of those AI-powered NPCs was to provide characters who can “dynamically” react to players in real-time, but within guidelines established by Ubisoft designers. The company said that it had guardrails in place to help stop the AI companions from hallucinating, being overly toxic, or going completely off script. But even Ubisoft admitted <a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/ubisoft-s-first-playable-generative-ai-experience-is-an-r-d-experiment-called-teammates-">in an interview with <em>Game Developer</em></a> that <em>Teammates</em> and its tech were still rough around the edges.</p>

 <p>In interviews about <em>Teammates</em>, Ubisoft tries to make the case that this tech won’t remove the human element from video game development. I find that hard to believe, considering that over the last two years or so, the studio has <a href="https://www.blog.udonis.co/mobile-marketing/mobile-games/ubisoft-layoffs">laid off over 600 employees</a> as it cuts costs and struggles to ship games people get excited about. I’m not sure NPCs that sort of listen to you when you tell them to do something is going to turn things around for Ubisoft, but it could potentially let them gut even more of the company while pivoting to AI moonshots at a time when the company’s future has never been more uncertain.</p>

 <p>“Games of tomorrow will listen, understand, and react to players far more than today, and our research gives a glimpse of what adaptive, generative play could add on top of proven game systems,”<a href="https://variety.com/2025/digital/news/ubisoft-generative-ai-game-teammates-neo-npc-developers-1236588038/"> Ubisoft director of GenAI gameplay Xavier Manzanares told <em>Variety</em>.</a> “It’s the first time we’ve shared an experiment this early with players, but our goal is to pave the way with a strong technology layer so our creators can start imagining the value it could bring to their project and players.”</p> <p>And who even knows if Ubisoft will still be developing AI-powered content and tools in a few years? Remember, it wasn’t that long ago that Ubisoft was all in on NFTs and the metaverse. Sure, <a href="https://kotaku.com/ubisoft-captain-laserhawk-the-game-nft-crypto-1851726108">Ubisoft technically hasn’t</a> completely <a href="https://x.com/EdenOnline_exe/status/1989025366669701411">given up on either</a>. But it’s pretty clear now that the company is moving on to AI as the next big thing that it hopes can convince investors that it is on the cutting edge of the future and deserving of more money, please.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><span>Oscar Isaac, star of Guillermo del Toro’s </span><i><span>Frankenstein </span></i><span>film, signs a lot of autographs. Prior to his role as the titular doctor in del Toro’s take on the Gothic horror classic, he was Poe Dameron in </span><i><span>Star Wars</span></i><span>, Duke Leto Atreides in </span><i><span>Dune</span></i><span>, and one of the alternate Spider-Men in</span><i><span> Across the Spider-Verse</span></i><span>. This man has been made into a Funko Pop several times over, and he clearly feels some type of way about them.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>He can probably spot an autograph reseller a mile away, too. That may be what happened when someone approached him outside of the Egyptian Theater in Los Angeles yesterday and asked him to sign some </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/funko-pop-starnger-things-bitty-bankrupt-2000642395"><span>Funko Pops</span></a><span>, to which Isaac replied, “Nah, man, I’m not doing those Funkos.” </span></p>

 <p><span>The POV recording, from the perspective of the Funko Pop wielder, showed the stranger holding out a </span><i><span>Spider-Man 2099</span></i><span> Funko Pop after Isaac signs a </span><i><span>Frankenstein </span></i><span>poster from the back of a truck, then stepping away, slightly dejected after the denial.</span></p>

 <div><blockquote cite="https://www.tiktok.com/@eladiioenrrique/video/7574866863277100319" data-video-id="7574866863277100319" data-embed-from="oembed"> <section> <a target="_blank" title="@eladiioenrrique" href="https://www.tiktok.com/@eladiioenrrique?refer=embed">@eladiioenrrique</a>  <p>11/16/2025 – On Sunday, I got a last minute tip that Oscar Isaac was going to be at the Egyptian Theatre, (I know I told you this through DM but thank you again!), (you know who you are lol), so I tried to get him to sign my Spider-Man 2099 Funko Pops along with a Moon Knight Funko and a Spider-Man 2099 mini poster for my sister, of course in the video you only see the pops, but unfortunately Oscar stopped for the kid Grapher to sign Frankenstein items but he didn’t want to sign Marvel items. It was great to see him in person and honestly I don’t blame him at all, it was a long shot especially after hearing that he isn’t on good terms with Disney after that whole Kimmel incident but I was hoping he would sign the merch at least because imo he is still the most badass Miguel O’Hara and Moon Knight out there, he makes both characters, I’m sorry lol. I’m definitely going to get backlash for that lol. But anyways, thought I would share my interaction with him, and if Oscar sees this somehow, Oscar I understand and hopefully one day I can still get your autograph on the Spider-Man 2099 as well as my sister’s mini poster&nbsp;! Oh and if Disney sees this, please fix things with Oscar, we need him back in marvel, there is no Moon Knight or Spider-Man 2099 without him. <a title="spiderman2099" target="_blank" href="https://www.tiktok.com/tag/spiderman2099?refer=embed">#spiderman2099</a>  <a title="oscarisaac" target="_blank" href="https://www.tiktok.com/tag/oscarisaac?refer=embed">#OscarIsaac</a>  <a title="fyp" target="_blank" href="https://www.tiktok.com/tag/fyp?refer=embed">#fyp</a>  <a title="disney" target="_blank" href="https://www.tiktok.com/tag/disney?refer=embed">#Disney</a>  <a title="frankenstein" target="_blank" href="https://www.tiktok.com/tag/frankenstein?refer=embed">#Frankenstein</a> </p> <p> <a target="_blank" title="♬ original sound - eladiioenrrique" href="https://www.tiktok.com/music/original-sound-7574866731131292447?refer=embed">♬ original sound – eladiioenrrique</a> </p></section> </blockquote></div>   <p><span>The Funko Pop collector, known as </span><a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@eladiioenrrique?lang=en"><span>EladiioEnrrique on TikTok</span></a><span>, alleged in the caption of his video that Isaac “didn’t want to sign Marvel items.”&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><span>“It was a long shot, especially after hearing that he isn’t on good terms with Disney after that whole Kimmel incident,” he wrote, referring to Isaac’s recent </span><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XciB_FC2fzs"><i><span>GQ</span></i><span> interview</span></a><span> in which he said he’d consider reprising his role as Poe in </span><i><span>Star Wars</span></i><span> only “if they can kinda figure out [how], you know, not [to] succumb to fascism.” He was referring to ABC and Disney’s brief suspension of their late-night show host back in September after Jimmy Kimmel joked about the Trump administration’s reaction to the assassination of Charlie Kirk.</span></p>

 <p><span>It’s not clear if Isaac was refusing to sign Marvel merch specifically or if he was just refusing to sign Funko Pops in general, as they’re incredibly popular on the autograph reseller market. There are nearly 100,000 results for “signed Funko Pop” on eBay, with many of them going for a few hundred dollars. It’s now not uncommon for people like the owner of the aforementioned TikTok channel to follow celebrities around with several pieces of their respective merch in hand and ask for autographs, only to later try to flip them online for thousands of dollars.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><span>A </span><a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@eladiioenrrique/video/7570077334158511390?lang=en"><span>different video from EladiioEnrrique’s account</span></a><span> shows a horde of people waiting for pop star Miley Cyrus to sign autographs. One person has all of her vinyls taped together in a vertical stack, while another has several items hung from a hangar, all to make a mass-signing as quick and painless as possible.</span></p>

 <p><span>Most of EladiioEnrrique’s channel is just first-person POV videos of him getting celebrities to sign records, CDs, and, of course, Funko Pops. His latest video says that he got a “last-minute tip” that Isaac would be at the Egyptian Theater before rushing over to get the signatures. But he’s not a reseller. “I am a collector,” he told <em>Kotaku</em> via TikTok DM. “I don’t resell my signed items simply because I don’t see it as right.”</span></p> <p>“It’s definitely not my job, I know a lot of the graphers do actually do this for a living and go to eBay immediately to sell it,” he said when asked if he did this for a living. “I know this because I’ve seen their posts at times, but I can’t do it for a living, hell no.”</p> <p><span>After Isaac refused to sign his toys, EladiioEnrrique stepped away politely and wrote a very understanding but hopeful caption for his video.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>“If Oscar sees this somehow, Oscar I understand and hopefully one day I can still get your autograph on the Spider-Man 2099 as well as my sister’s mini poster! Oh and if Disney sees this, please fix things with Oscar, we need him back in Marvel, there is no Moon Knight or Spider-Man 2099 without him.” it read.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>May all superfans be this well-adjusted.</span></p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/sonos-era-100-falls-to-new-record-low-now-cheaper-than-speakers-with-mediocre-sound-quality-2000646231</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/sonos-era-100-falls-to-new-record-low-now-cheaper-than-speakers-with-mediocre-sound-quality.1361137/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>For years, Sonos made its name with WiFi streaming alone, avoiding Bluetooth at all costs to keep audio quality high. It finally relented with portable speakers, realizing convenience does matter for some use cases without invalidating the core WiFi basis of what makes Sonos so great. The <strong>Era 100</strong> competes directly with Bose and Sony’s premium offerings while it currently sells for mid-range pricing that makes no sense given its capabilities. Amazon <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5807/">dropped this to $169 for Black Friday, down from $199, which is a record low</a> that puts exceptional audio within reach of anyone looking for Bluetooth speakers.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5807/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>47% Faster Processor Powers Dual-Tweeter Architecture</h2>
<p>The next-generation processor handles more complex audio processing in real time and enables features that previous Sonos speakers couldn’t support. Dual tweeters create genuine stereo separation from a single speaker, placing instruments and vocals in distinct left and right positions. This architecture produces a soundstage that fills rooms rather than feeling like sound emanates from a single point. The <strong>25% larger midwoofer extends bass response deeper than the previous generation</strong>, and gives kick drums and bass lines actual impact without needing a separate subwoofer for most music.</p>
<p>This compact design fits easily on bookshelves, kitchen counters, desks and nightstands. You place the speaker wherever you really spend time, rather than arranging furniture around audio equipment. <strong>The size makes it truly portable inside your home</strong>&nbsp;and moves from room to room as the day progresses with you. It weighs enough to feel substantial yet remains light enough to carry easily in one hand.</p>



<p>Wi-Fi streaming provides lossless audio quality from the likes of Spotify, Apple Music, Tidal, and Amazon Music. The connection also remains stable throughout a home without the dropouts that plague Bluetooth in larger spaces. You control playback through the Sonos app which aggregates all of your streaming services into one interface. AirPlay 2 support adds another streaming option for Apple users who want to send audio directly from their devices.</p>
<p><strong>Bluetooth connectivity handles quick pairing with phones</strong>, tablets, and laptops when you want simple wireless playback. You press a button on the back of the speaker, and instantly, your device finds it. This mode is great for playing podcasts, audiobooks, or music from apps that aren’t integrated into the Sonos ecosystem. The implementation of Bluetooth maintains decent quality, though Wi-Fi streaming sounds noticeably better when that option is available.</p>
<p>The Line-In Adapter includes <strong>a 3.5mm auxiliary input to connect turntables</strong>, CD players, or other analog sources. This adapter is available separately but turns the Era 100 into a powered speaker for vinyl setups or legacy audio equipment. It combines digital streaming with analog input flexibility that pure Bluetooth speakers simply can’t compete with.</p>



<p>Trueplay tuning uses your iPhone’s microphone to <strong>analyze room acoustics and then automatically adjust the speaker’s EQ</strong>. You wave your phone around the listening area for about a minute, and it makes a custom sound profile optimized for your particular space. This calibration compensates for room characteristics, such as hard surfaces that create reflections or soft furnishings that absorb sound. The difference between tuned and untuned sound is immediately noticeable, with vocals becoming clearer and bass tightening up.</p>
<p><strong>Alexa integration enables voice control</strong> for music playback, smart home commands, and general queries. The built-in microphones pick up voice commands clearly even when music plays at moderate volumes. You can add the Era 100 to multi-room setups with other Sonos speakers, creating a whole-home audio system that plays synchronized music everywhere or different content in each room. This ecosystem approach means starting with one speaker and expanding over time as budget allows.</p>
<p>For $169, you’re getting Sonos premium audio engineering, with both WiFi and Bluetooth for less than mid-range speakers elsewhere that can’t compete on sound quality. Similarly priced Bose and Sony speakers rely exclusively on Bluetooth and don’t have the multi-room capabilities that make Sonos special.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/save-a-massive-350-on-the-16-inch-asus-tuf-gaming-laptop-at-amazon-today-2000645816</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/asus-tuf-f16-gaming-laptop-rtx-4050-takes-a-black-friday-price-hit-that-makes-zero-sense.1361110/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>There’s no shortage of laptops in the market, but not every powerful laptop is a gaming laptop. Standard laptops (made for everyday work and casual use) prioritize features like battery life, decent display, and lower costs. Gaming machines, on the other hand, pack high-performance components that can let you game and work on creative projects without slowing down. These options typically have stronger dedicated GPUs and CPUs, faster RAMs, and a bigger storage capacity, but as you’d expect, they can cost a pretty penny.</p>
<p>Most solid options out there with all this and more sit well over $1,500, but that changes today. Amazon has kick-started its Black Friday and Cyber Monday celebrations already with some impressive early deals across a range of categories.<a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5798/"> As part of that, the retailer has also dropped the price of the 16-inch ASUS TUF gaming laptop by 32%.</a> On a regular day, it would run you around $1,100, but you can snap it up for just $750 today. Honestly, that’s what most entry-level machines cost nowadays, which makes this offer no less than a steal. Of course, the stock is selling out fast, so there’s not much time left to save. If you have been wanting to upgrade your gaming experience for less, today is the day to make the move. In fact, this laptop can also be a great Christmas gift for a player in your life!</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5798/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Powerful GPU, Immersive Visuals</h2>
<p>There’s nothing too crazy going on with the design. The laptop looks and feels sturdy, plus comes with a subtle embossed TUF logo on its cover. The brand has thoroughly tested it to meet Military Grade testing standards, so you can expect it to handle everyday wear and tear well. Harsh conditions such as extreme temperatures, high humidity, and dirt won’t affect its performance one bit. But despite the sturdy, don’t-mess-with-me build, it’s lightweight enough to carry around easily. Take it to your office, nearby cafe, and even on some adventures without a worry.</p>
<p>Open it up and you’re greeted with a 16-inch Full HD display, which pushes immersive, detailed visuals. The 90% screen-to-body ratio gives you plenty of space to work and play. Color accuracy is excellent in all lighting conditions, making the content appear lifelike. The display also supports a 144Hz refresh rate to keep everything running smoothly, while the Adaptive-Sync technology actively reduces lag and minimizes stuttering for ultra-smooth gameplay.</p>



<p>Power is handled by an Intel Core i5 210H processor that’s paired with the underrated NVIDIA GeForce RTX 4050. The GPU offers a significant performance boost over its predecessor and is a great entry-level option for those on a budget. Then there’s a modest 16GB RAM for increased efficiency. It’s not massive, but does a good job of handling everyday multitasking and most modern titles without throwing a fit. You will also be able to store all your favorite games and creative programs without feeling limited, thanks to the massive 512GB PCIe Gen4 SSD. And since SSDs offer much faster system boot and load times, you won’t have to wait long to get on with your day.</p>
<p>Best of all, despite powerful performance, the laptop does not overheat. ASUS has packed it with Arc Flow Fans, 4 exhaust vents, 5 dedicated heat pipes, and an anti-dust filter; all of which come together to keep things cool and quiet in the background as you teach some bad guys a lesson. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5798/">There’s a lot more to like about this laptop, especially now that it’s going for just $750. The discount won’t be around forever, so it’s best to get your orders in fast.</a></p>

              <p>Good music can instantly lift your mood and bring life to gatherings. If you host often or like to enjoy your favorite tracks with a rich, room-filling sound, having a solid speaker is a must. The best ones out there offer a mix of portability, reliable battery life, and, of course, deep sound.</p>
<p>If you’re looking to grab such an option without paying the full price, we come bearing good news. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5797/">Thanks to an early Black Friday deal, the top-rated Beats Pill speaker, which typically goes for $150, is currently available for just $100.</a> That’s after a nice 33% discount, and it applies to all color options. Like your audio gear basic? Consider the black option. Need something a bit more cheerful? The red pill (quite literally) is going to look stunning! Note that this deal gets you just the speaker. If you’re looking to pair it with a handy USB-C charging cable, the bundle is going for $110 (down from $168); just ten bucks more.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5797/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>
<p>Both deals are open to both Prime and non-Prime members. There are no complicated steps to take care of to score the discount, either. We highly recommend jumping on the offer fast, as it could wrap up any moment now. Considering how this is one of the lowest prices we have seen the speaker drop to ever, we’re also not expecting it to stay in stock for long.</p>

<h2>Powerful, Room-Filling Sound</h2>
<p>The speaker is truly portable. It’s shaped like a pill and is quite lightweight. There’s a removable lanyard that makes it easy to carry around. Take it off when you want a cleaner look, or don’t want it to get the way during outdoor activities. The overall material is quite durable as well, meaning the Pill can handle everyday wear and tear like a champ.</p>
<p>When it comes to performance, Beats has packed the speaker with a bigger, bespoke racetrack woofer that can displace 90% more air volume to deliver fuller bass. The redesigned tweeter takes care of all the highs and lows in your favorite tracks to offer better clarity. Expect minimal distortion even when you are listening to songs at high volume. Vibing to the latest Taylor Swift song or trying to keep your child entertained with a lullaby, the Beats Pill fills the room with high-quality audio that pulls you in.</p>



<p>There’s also support for lossless audio, which you can enjoy by connecting your speaker to your laptop or other compatible devices via the USB-C cable. This mode retains all the data from the source recording to preserve full, original quality. It basically gets you higher-quality audio, so you can enjoy tracks to the fullest. Want an even bigger experience? Pair two of these together to listen in the Amplify mode or Stereo mode.</p>
<p>It’s IP67-rated for dust and water resistance. Take it to the beach or by the pool without a worry. And even though Beats is owned by Apple, the speaker plays nicely with both Apple and Android devices. Pairing literally takes a few minutes, and once you have it connected to your phone or laptop, you can even take calls directly through it!</p>
<p>A single charge gets you up to 24 hours of battery life, which is more than enough to get the party going all day and all night. Even better, it doubles as a power bank when needed. Plug your device in via USB-C cable and juice it up without stepping away from the dance floor.</p>
<p>All things considered, the Beats Pill speaker is a great option to consider if you’re looking for a powerful, yet portable Bluetooth speaker.<a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5797/"> It’s now down to $100, which is basically nothing considering the features it packs.</a></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>January 30, 2014. Over a decade ago now. I sat down and <a href="https://www.giantbomb.com/profile/halomaste19/blog/i-m-still-excited-for-half-life-3/104703/">wrote up a blog on my personal <em>Giant Bomb</em> account</a> about <em>Half-Life 3</em> and why, after seven years of waiting, I was still excited. Now, 17 years after the launch of<em> Half-Life 2: Episode</em> 2 and five years after <em>Half-Life Alyx,</em> I find myself still waiting for Valve to announce <em>Half-Life 3.</em> And while some might not care anymore or may even find it all tiring, I’m still excited, damn it.</p> <p>For the last few weeks, <a href="https://kotaku.com/half-life-3-timeline-hype-leaks-clues-explained-release-date-november-trailer-2000645448">hype has been building around <em>Half-Life 3</em></a>, despite Valve never announcing or even teasing it. Doesn’t matter. Since late 2021, something has been building in the community. <a href="https://miro.com/app/board/uXjVINqBTwM=/?moveToWidget=3458764648489439347&amp;cot=14">Dataminers have continued to extract and share pieces of code</a> from other Valve games that seem to indicate that the company is working on a new <em>Half-Life</em> game, reportedly codenamed HLX. Then, earlier this month, Valve announced <a href="https://kotaku.com/16-cool-details-valve-new-steam-machine-console-controller-vr-headset-2000643572">three (lol) new pieces of gaming hardware</a>, but didn’t announce a new game to go with any of it. That struck some as odd and got many wondering if that datamined <em>Half-Life</em> project was set to be a Steam Machine launch game in 2026.</p>

 <p>Sprinkle on to this situation some insiders teasing another big reveal, extra security being spotted at Valve during the hands-on with the new hardware, and what appears to be a new Valve game waiting to be revealed on Steam, and you end up with what we have now: A lot of people freaking out about <em>Half-Life 3</em> possibly being announced very soon. And you know what? I’m one of those people, and I think more people should be hyped.</p>

 <h2>Why you should care about <em>Half-Life 3</em></h2> <p><em>Half-Life 2: Episode 2′</em>s ending was an infamous cliffhanger that killed off a major character and raised the stakes in a big way. And for 13 years, that cliffhanger remained unchanged and had many <em>Half-Life</em> fans like me desperate to find out what happens next. We finally found out in <em>Half-Life: Alyx</em>, which is a VR prequel whose ending makes a big change to the cliffhanger, undoing that shocking death and replacing it with a mysterious new situation, one which only Gordon Freeman seems capable of solving. Five years later I’m still waiting, and I’m still super excited to see what happens next.</p>

 <p>The thought of Gordon Freeman and his iconic crowbar going after the G-Man and possibly wrapping up the storyline that started in<em> Half-Life</em> back in 1998 is a tantalizing one. This is a world and narrative I’ve thought about a lot for…well, most of my life. And the idea that it might finally be wrapping up in the near(ish) future has me bouncing off the walls. But maybe <em>you</em> don’t care about the world of <em>Half-Life.</em> That’s fair. There’s still plenty of reason to be excited to see what Valve does next.</p>

  <p>I’m really fascinated to see the next big video game from Valve. This is a studio with a nearly flawless track record that prides itself on creating incredible experiences that push technology and game design forward. And <em>Half-Life</em> is the studio’s flagship franchise. The thing that made everything else possible. So it makes sense that a lot of money, care, and time are being put into making HLX, or <em>Half-Life 3</em>, something very special.</p>

 <p><em>HLX</em> also, based on datamined leaks, will be the studio’s first non-VR, full-length single-player video game release since 2011’s <em>Portal 2</em>.&nbsp; Valve just hasn’t made a game like this in a long, long time, and that alone has me intrigued.</p>

 <p>What does a big AAA <em>Half-Life</em> sequel look like in 2025 or, more likely, 2026? Valve often uses the <em>Half-Life</em> franchise to push game technology forward while trying out new ideas like VR, HDR, advanced physics, and the gravity gun. What will be the cool new “thing” in <em>Half-Life 3</em>? Data mining points to some impressive-sounding simulation tech that can accurately recreate how wet an object is or how flammable a surface might be, which could lead to some wild puzzles. Or maybe it will make combat more dynamic?</p> <p>Until whatever game using this tech is <em>actually</em> released, we won’t know for sure how it will be used, but I have to imagine that the next <em>Half-Life</em> game from Valve won’t just be six or seven levels that play mostly like <em>Half-Life 2</em> but with a shiny coat of paint slapped on top. Valve isn’t that kind of studio. That’s now how they make games. And that has me really excited to see what the team has been cooking up for the last five years or so.</p> <h2>A big game not burdened by stockholders or trends</h2> <p>Another big reason to be excited: Unlike most other game studios and publishers, Valve answers to nobody. It has all the money it needs and can make whatever it wants, essentially. So <em>Half-Life 3</em> won’t need to include microtransactions, AI generation tools, battle passes, cosmetic stores, free-to-play elements, crossover content, ads, or anything else that most players find annoying. <em>Half-Life 3</em> doesn’t have to chase trends. <em>Half-Life 3</em> doesn’t have to be an extraction shooter because the publisher demands it. Instead, Valve can spend many years and a shit-ton of money building something it wants to make, and that sounds very refreshing.</p>

 <p>In a time when every game seems to be from one of three genres or is a remake, Valve’s next <em>Half-Life</em> sequel could be something very different. It could be a AAA, modern single-player action-shooter developed by one of the best studios around, with no strings attached and powered by advanced simulation tech. Yes please!</p> <p>While I’m fairly confident that Valve is working on a<em> Half-Life</em> game that might end up being <em>Half-Life 3<!--StartFragment --><span>—</span><!--EndFragment --></em>there’s just too much damn data out there to say otherwise<!--StartFragment --><span>—</span><!--EndFragment -->there’s no guarantee it will see the light of day anytime soon, or ever. Valve is a weird company that isn’t publicly traded and, as mentioned, has an infinite money machine called Steam funding its activities. It has no financial reason to release something unless it wants to, and it can take as long as it wants to make anything.</p> <p>So maybe <em>Half-Life 3</em> gets announced tomorrow. Maybe in 2026. Maybe years from now. Regardless, I’m still excited, and I think anyone who cares about games should be, too.</p>
