The live-action movie doesn’t recreate the platformer’s story beat for beat, but it introduces Sonic’s revenge-driven rival Shadow, explores villain Doctor Robotnik’s family, and the moon gets blown up at one point, too. Despite keeping a lot of the same story elements, <em>Sonic 3</em> <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/sonic-hedgehog-3-adventure-2-differences-maria-shadow-1851729393&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/sonic-hedgehog-3-adventure-2-differences-maria-shadow-1851729393">does omit a few key characters</a></span> like the treasure-hunting thief Rouge the Bat, and the Biolizard, <em>Sonic Adventure 2</em>’s final boss. However, keen-eyed fans have noticed that the movie does seem to have a blink-and-you’ll-miss-it reference to the giant reptile, and they’re feeling conflicted about it.</p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="196742" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="What Is Dragonsplague?

This is a creation by Doctor Gerald Robotnik, who went on to create Shadow as the “true” product of his research into creating an immortal being. Since Gerald doesn’t create Shadow in the movies, as he’s an alien from another planet like all the anthropomorphic animals are, there was no need to include the Biolizard in <em>Sonic the Hedgehog 3</em>. However, it turns out the movie does feature a brief reference to the creature during Shadow’s flashbacks. 50 years prior to the events of the movie, Shadow lived in a government facility with Maria Robotnik, Gerald’s granddaughter. The two became close like siblings, and are shown playing together while scientists attempt to perform experiments on the speedy hedgehog. One of these moments sees the pair watching a kaiju movie that, at a glance, appears to be an homage to early <em>Godzilla </em>films. But upon further inspection, it’s also a clever reference to the Biolizard. The giant reptile shown terrorizing civilians in the movie bears a striking resemblance to the character, from its slender mechanical eyes to the cables that extend from its jaws down its body. The movie the two watch is in black-and-white, but I imagine if it had been in color more people would have immediately caught onto this reference seeing its orange-brown skin.</p><p>On one hand, it is cool to see the movie pay homage to an important figure in Shadow’s game story, but given the way the live-action <em>Sonic </em>universe has previously treated one of the big monster-like enemies of the games as a comic relief prop, some fans aren’t thrilled with how <em>Sonic 3</em> references the Biolizard, fearing that it’s becoming a pattern for these movies. Iblis, a fiery monster from <em>Sonic ‘06</em>, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/knuckles-paramount-sonic-06-iblis-flames-of-disaster-1851427520&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/knuckles-paramount-sonic-06-iblis-flames-of-disaster-1851427520">is referenced in the <em>Knuckles</em> Paramount+ show</a></span> as a stage puppet in a rock opera episode. So now, having a second of the games’ big kaiju-esque monsters turned into something else has made some fans a bit wary, as they wonder if Sonic and friends will ever face something on that scale in the live-action movies.</p><p>That being said, some fans are fine with the Biolizard’s omission, saying its presence could have <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://x.com/redelecbeanz/status/1874178115146309798&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://x.com/redelecbeanz/status/1874178115146309798" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">complicated the story</a></span>, which then might not have translated to the screen as gracefully <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://x.com/SabdierZ/status/1874316026734862546&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://x.com/SabdierZ/status/1874316026734862546" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">as the more focused tale did</a></span>. Given the events of <em>Sonic 3</em>’s <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/sonic-hedgehog-3-4-post-credits-amy-rose-metal-shadow-1851726285&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/sonic-hedgehog-3-4-post-credits-amy-rose-metal-shadow-1851726285">post-credits scene</a></span>, there’s a strong possibility that Metal Overlord, Metal Sonic’s dragon-like form from <em>Sonic Heroes</em>, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://x.com/TheGameAllStar/status/1874415606767964660&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://x.com/TheGameAllStar/status/1874415606767964660" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">might show up in the fourth movie</a></span>, so maybe we’ll get to see Sonic, Shadow, and the rest of the crew face something on that scale when <em>Sonic 4 </em><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/sonic-4-sequel-confirmed-paramount-2027-sega-release-1851725410&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/sonic-4-sequel-confirmed-paramount-2027-sega-release-1851725410">premieres in 2027</a></span>. If not, there’s always Perfect Chaos, the final boss from <em>Sonic Adventure</em>, a water-based monster that floods entire cities. These movies have been playing fast and loose with the timeline, so there’s no harm in going back to a game before <em>Sonic Adventure 2</em>. </p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Despite its innocuous roots, DEI has become a loaded term in online debates, not because of what it actually means but for what it symbolizes to certain reactionary groups.</p><p>Pilestedt, who has a reputation among the sprawling <em>Helldivers 2</em> community for speaking often and openly on social media, replied with a more general and ambiguous proclamation about development. “If it doesn’t add to the game experience, it detracts,” he tweeted back. “And games should be a pure pursuit of amazing moments.”</p><p>“How would DEI have benefited <em>Helldivers 2</em>?” asked another user. Pilestedt responded, “I don’t like labels. But mankind is united in its extreme xenophobia on Super Earth. #Inclusion so, maybe that’s DEI?  I really don’t care. Make good games, don’t make a contemporary political statement.”</p><p>The irony of the tight-rope being walked—distancing <em>Helldivers 2</em> from the current online culture wars while not outright rejecting them—is that the sci-fi shooter is loaded with political allegories, satire, and parodies of fascist propaganda.

So now you can try to belt Cynthia Erivo’s “Defying Gravity” battle cry from the comfort of your own home. The digital version of the movie includes some special features like commentary from Erivo and co-lead Ariana Grande, behind-the-scenes interviews, and a handful of deleted scenes. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/wicked-movie-barbie-porn-site-mattel-1851694637&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/wicked-movie-barbie-porn-site-mattel-1851694637"><em>Wicked</em></a></span><em> </em>is already a long movie, running at two hours and 40 minutes, but after seeing some of the moments that were cut fans are asking if it would really have been so bad if the film had been a few minutes longer.</p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="197298" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="Live Forever in the Universe of 'New World: Aeternum'" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="108" data-playlist="197298,197284,197260" data-current="197298"><div><p>Live Forever in the Universe of 'New World: Aeternum'</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197298/197298_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197298/197298_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197298/197298_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197298/197298_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"></video></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>Some of these deleted scenes were fine to cut. One includes Grande’s character, Glinda the Good Witch, meeting her cronies Pfannee and ShenShen, and while it’s nice to give those characters a little more screen time, they’re mostly bit players in the grand scheme of things. The ones that feel like they would have added a lot of meat to the film include Erivo as Elphaba taking just a few minutes to flesh out her ties to Glinda and her sister’s boyfriend Boq.</p><p>Elphaba and Glinda’s friendship is the lifeblood of both the film and stage versions of <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/wicked-mattel-porn-lawsuit-news-1851713647&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/wicked-mattel-porn-lawsuit-news-1851713647"><em>Wicked</em></a></span>, and while there’s a lot of time spent on their enemies-to-friends arc, a few gaps could’ve been filled. The deleted scene “Elphaba’s Promise” is only two minutes long but adds a great deal to the characters’ complicated relationship. This small interaction between the two as they study magic addresses the weird lack of acknowledging the point earlier in the film when Elphaba slips away with Glinda’s boyfriend Fiyero to save a captured lion cub. Here, we see Glinda ask why Elphaba didn’t ask her for help, to which Elphaba apologizes and says she won’t leave her behind again. In the final film, the two never really have a conversation about what happened. This would have also punctuated the moment later when Elphaba brings Glinda along with her to the Emerald City to meet the Wizard. Seeing that this scene was shot and ready to go makes it a puzzling omission. Yes, yes, you’ve gotta cut some things for time, but you’re telling me the duo fucking about with a busted hot air balloon in the last 20 minutes was more valuable than them fleshing out their relationship?</p><p>Another cut interaction that would have added a lot to the movie is one between Elphaba and Ethan Slater’s Boq. The munchkin is the boyfriend of Elphaba’s sister Nessarose, but he secretly harbors feelings for Glinda. Well, it’s a secret to Nessarose, at least. In “Boq &amp; Elphaba talk,” the Witch of the West talks with Boq about their hopes and dreams and how they’re both hopelessly in love with two unavailable people. When Elphaba is unwilling to admit she has feelings for Fiyero, Boq ends the chat with a banger of a line: “I’m sorry, I misunderstood. I thought we were being honest.” Tea clocked.</p><p>Without spoiling anything for those who don’t know anything about <em>Wicked</em>’s second act—which will make up the sequel movie <em>Wicked: For Good </em>on November 21—Boq is a pretty important character in what’s to come. Though the first film rightfully focuses on Elphaba and Glinda, its ensemble cast is about to go through some transformative experiences in the second film, and giving them just a little bit more time could have gone a long way. At least we have these scenes available to view in the special features. Even if they weren’t in the final cut, you can pretty much consider them canon because they slot nicely into the movie we got.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

The lengthy technical document outlines a process for AI-upscaling that could be used to improve image quality using software rather than raw processing power, similar to DLSS used by Nvidia GPUs for PC gaming, as well as PSSR which was recently introduced by Sony for the PlayStation 5 Pro. </p><p>Dale also points out another potential use of the technology: keeping game file sizes small. Nintendo’s first-party releases on the current Switch are infamous for how optimized they are. <em>The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom</em> is the company’s biggest game on the platform and it’s still only 18.2GB.<strong> </strong>Higher resolution textures and other improved assets can all dramatically increase that digital footprint, however.</p><p> The patent outlines an example where native 4K textures might bump a game’s install size up to 60GB, while a 1080 native version that uses upscaling could get away with just 20GB, which is still less than the current 32GB cap on existing Switch cartridge memory sizes. </p><p>News of the patent comes alongside more alleged leaks about the Switch 2 hardware itself. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/nintendo-switch-2-reveal-images-leaks-ai-fake-reddit-1851729048&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/nintendo-switch-2-reveal-images-leaks-ai-fake-reddit-1851729048">Following a recent influx of possible first-look images at the upgraded console</a></span>, there are now <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/NintendoSwitch2/comments/1hqu83a/switch_2_motherboard/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/NintendoSwitch2/comments/1hqu83a/switch_2_motherboard/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">potential photos of the hardware’s actual motherboard</a></span> floating around online. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://famiboards.com/threads/future-nintendo-hardware-technology-speculation-discussion-st-new-staff-post-please-read.55/page-3804#post-1495792&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://famiboards.com/threads/future-nintendo-hardware-technology-speculation-discussion-st-new-staff-post-please-read.55/page-3804#post-1495792" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">This has led to some heated debate</a></span> about what semiconductor manufacturing process was used to create the Switch 2's chip and <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://x.com/dark1x/status/1874534475734073681&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://x.com/dark1x/status/1874534475734073681" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">thus how powerful it might be</a></span>. </p><p>Ultimately, however, it’s impossible to know just how powerful the Switch 2 will be compared to the existing, seven-year-old hardware, until we get a sense of the full list of trade-offs Nintendo has decided on once it reveals the official list of specs and features. If the current Switch has proven anything, it’s that the <em>Mario</em> maker knows how to squeeze great results out of more affordable technology. </p><p>.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Each of <em>Oblivion</em>’s nine regions of Cyrodiil has unique flora and fauna for the team to recreate, and that’s on top of the enormous landscapes and cities.</p><p>The Gold Coast, for instance, is all but complete, with a new version of main city Anvil, “re-envisioned to realize its original concept art.” It’s the most wildly ambitious project, and as you’ll see in the video below, it looks <em>wonderful</em>.</p><p>Given <em>Skyrim</em> itself is 13 years old, it’s a testament to its engine how stunning <em>Skyblivion</em> is looking (albeit boosted by Bethesda’s own <em>Skyrim: Special Edition</em> upgrades). It does seem a bit galling that Bethesda will be sitting on whatever tech they’re using for <em>The Elder Scrolls VI</em>, but this still looks so, so much better than the 19-year-old <em>Oblivion</em> original.</p><p>The video’s narration makes clear that in order to release <em>Skyblivion</em>, they are legally required to remake every asset, including all the 3D models, which is a task of unimaginable magnitude. (Bethesda had a team of hundreds working for four years at full pay to do this the first time—this is a group of unpaid volunteers working in their spare time.) As such, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://skyblivion.com/volunteer/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://skyblivion.com/volunteer/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">the team is looking for more volunteers</a></span>—especially for <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Navigation_mesh&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Navigation_mesh" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">navmeshing</a></span>, UI and 3D modeling—to help them get the game over the line.</p><figure id="" data-id="8550ca352cd14e6cc4e20537a23563d2" data-recommend-id="image://8550ca352cd14e6cc4e20537a23563d2" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1074" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="An image of a sunny, autumnal glen, with Worldspaces progress bars on the left." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="An image of a sunny, autumnal glen, with Worldspaces progress bars on the left." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->TES Renewal Project / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="8550ca352cd14e6cc4e20537a23563d2" data-recommend-id="image://8550ca352cd14e6cc4e20537a23563d2" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1074" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="An image of a sunny, autumnal glen, with Worldspaces progress bars on the left." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>This whole thing blows my mind. The Skyblivion Team has also written new music for each section of the game, and they’re even considering porting across the DLC when this main game is finished. Planned since 2011, prototyped by 2014, and in full development from 2018, they’re confident for a 2025 release, likely years ahead of Bethesda’s own follow-up, <em>The Elder Scrolls VI: Hammerfell</em>.</p><p>Kudos to Bethesda for letting extraordinary projects like these thrive, rather than sending takedown notifications and legal threats. To be able to play <em>Skyblivion</em>, you will be required to own legitimate versions of both <em>Oblivion GOTY Deluxe </em>and <em>Skyrim: Special Edition</em>, although given you can currently pick up <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://store.steampowered.com/app/900883/The_Elder_Scrolls_IV_Oblivion_Game_of_the_Year_Edition_Deluxe/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/900883/The_Elder_Scrolls_IV_Oblivion_Game_of_the_Year_Edition_Deluxe/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">the former for $5</a></span> and <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://store.steampowered.com/app/489830/The_Elder_Scrolls_V_Skyrim_Special_Edition/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/489830/The_Elder_Scrolls_V_Skyrim_Special_Edition/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">the latter for $10</a></span> on Steam, that’s not a big outlay.</p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

They’ll be available starting January 7:</p><blockquote data-type="BlockQuote"><ul data-type="List" data-style="Bullet"><li><strong><em>Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League</em> | PS5 </strong></li><li><strong><em>Need for Speed Hot Pursuit Remastered</em> | PS4</strong></li><li><strong><em>The Stanley Parable: Ultra Deluxe</em> | PS4, PS5</strong></li></ul></blockquote><p>  <em>The Stanley Parable </em>is a critically acclaimed 2013 walking sim meta-narrative about game design and player agency, with the recently released <em>Ultra Deluxe</em> version improving the graphics and enormously expanding on  the content. <em>Need for Speed Hot Pursuit Remastered</em>, meanwhile, is one of the better games in the racing series, developed by Criterion Games, makers of the<em> Burnout</em> franchise. </p><p><strong>Read More:</strong> <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/suicide-squad-justice-league-review-is-it-good-batman-1851222047&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/suicide-squad-justice-league-review-is-it-good-batman-1851222047"><em>Suicide Squad: Kill The Justice League</em>: The <em>Kotaku </em>Review</a></span></p><p>But it’s <em>Suicide Squad</em> that’s the most notable to see in the lineup. Rocksteady Studios’ first new game since <em>Batman: Arkham Knight</em>, the open-world looter shooter ended up being a big disappointment for many fans of the Arkhamverse. The cutscenes and character work are still top-notch, however, and there are some neat things to see and discover in its sprawling Metropolis sandbox. </p><p>Unfortunately, it’s also chock full of live-service filler, with repetitive missions and boring enemy encounters. Hence why a year into its post-launch roadmap, the studio hasn’t announced any additional updates to conclude the game’s multiverse narrative saga. Deathstroke arrived last month as part of season 4, joining Joker, Mrs. Freeze, Lawless, and the rest of the playable roster. </p><p>The final update will go live on January 14, at which point an offline mode will make it possible for players to still experience the main campaign and post-launch story missions, even when <em>Suicide Squad</em>’s multiplayer servers eventually go offline. </p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
