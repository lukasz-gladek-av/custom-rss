The iconic killer from the <em>Scream </em>films is a bit of a horror movie oddball as each one has been a different person, often working with others. And that’s true in <em>Mortal Kombat 1</em>, too.

The latest guest character is Ghostface from the <em>Scream </em>movies. And according to <em>MK1</em>'s devs, they might be one of the most unique characters in the history of the series.</p><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://youtu.be/68xHLNtlfsw&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://youtu.be/68xHLNtlfsw" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">During November 13's <em>Kombat Kast</em> video stream</a></span>, developer NetherRealm’s lead QA analyst Stephanie Brownback talked about Ghostface and called the character a “jack of all trades” that works alongside two other masked killers to pull off various moves and fatalities. The main Ghostface you play as has been transported from the movies to the <em>MK </em>universe. And this is where it gets interesting because according to Brownback, this singular Ghostface killer then partners up with two people from Kano’s Black Dragon Clan. </p><p>In the video Browback called the two helpers “Black Dragon Enforcer” and “Black Dragon Assassin” and explained that these aren’t random anonymous characters, but that the devs actually know who they are.</p><p>“I know who they are...but one of the fun things about <em>Scream </em>is the whodunnit aspect,” said Brownback. </p><p> “You shouldn’t figure out who the killer is till the third act reveal. So for this stream we’re not going to name any names. It’s up to you to look at the clues, the Easter eggs, and maybe try to figure it out for yourselves. Argue amongst yourselves.” </p><p>Brownback didn’t reveal the characters’ identities because that would “very much go against the spirit of the <em>Scream </em>movies.”</p><p>So who are the masked killers in <em>Mortal Kombat 1</em>? <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://mortalkombat.fandom.com/wiki/Kira&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://mortalkombat.fandom.com/wiki/Kira" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Perhaps Kira</a></span>, a lesser-known character from the PS2 era of games that loves knives and is kind of wacko?<span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://mortalkombat.fandom.com/wiki/Jarek#Mortal_Kombat_1&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://mortalkombat.fandom.com/wiki/Jarek#Mortal_Kombat_1" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"> Maybe Jarek</a></span>, who is a very strong brute that you might describe as an enforcer and who has been referenced already in <em>MK1</em>? I assume fans and<em> MK</em> nerds will figure this out within hours of the characters being available. </p><p> Ghostface officially joins <em>MK1</em>'s roster on November 26. However, if you own  the Premium or Kollector’s Edition of the fighting game, you can play as the killer as early as November 19. </p><p> .<br></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Those objects include the basketballs you can toss around spawn points in Control matches which, these days, serve little purpose but letting you try to score a basket or two before the game starts. However, back when you could attach Symmetra’s turrets to them, you could then knock them out of the spawn area and into the battlefield. The turrets lock on to foes and fire high-damage beams at any nearby enemy, which means that if you have several of them attached to a basketball, you can knock the ball of death near enemies and watch it drain their health in seconds.</p><p>It’s fun seeing how much of <em>Overwatch</em>’s refinement over the years has sanded away some of the funny and chaotic strategies players once utilized.

Otherwise, we still don’t have a trailer or even a real synopsis of what season 4 proper will entail.

It’s a perfect example of Apple TV’s narrow, lowkey success with original programming that is very good and almost nobody is watching. People can start remedying that in the meantime by catching up on seasons 1-3. </p><p>.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

And now, a new trailer shows us more of this impressive-looking project that turns <em>Half-Life 2</em> into a sleek-looking modern FPS. </p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="197298" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="Live Forever in the Universe of 'New World: Aeternum'" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="108" data-playlist="197298,197284,197260" data-current="197298"><div><p>Live Forever in the Universe of 'New World: Aeternum'</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197298/197298_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197298/197298_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197298/197298_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197298/197298_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"></video></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.hl2rtx.com/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.hl2rtx.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>Half-Life 2 RTX</em></a></span> was first officially revealed in 2023 by Nvidia. The project is a collaboration between multiple modders and fan developers who have worked on previous <em>Half-Life</em> related projects, including <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/half-life-2-vr-mod-alyx-pc-valve-steam-gordon-freeman-1849603782&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/half-life-2-vr-mod-alyx-pc-valve-steam-gordon-freeman-1849603782"><em>Half-Life 2 VR</em> and <em>Project 17</em></a></span>. Their goal is to create a mod powered by Nvidia’s Remix tools—modding tech created by the GPU company that lets people <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/nvidia-rtx-remix-mods-modder-max-payne-swat-portal-pc-1849884871&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/nvidia-rtx-remix-mods-modder-max-payne-swat-portal-pc-1849884871">add ray-traced features to old games easily and quickly</a></span>. However, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/games/half-life-2-rtx&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/games/half-life-2-rtx"><em>HL2 RTX</em></a></span> isn’t just adding some fancy shadows and calling it a day. Instead, the team’s goal is to remaster the entire game and every asset in it. And so far, it’s looking really good. </p><p>In a new behind-the-scenes trailer released on November 14, Nvidia sat down with some of the modders working on<em> Half-Life 2 RTX </em>and let them talk about why they are remastering this game and what it means to them 20 years later. (Yeah, <em>Half-Life 2</em> turns 20 on November 16.) And in the new trailer, we see a lot of <em>HL2 RTX</em> in action and it looks phenomenal. </p><p>The team’s goal isn’t to change how <em>Half-Life 2</em> plays, but instead to add a new coat of paint to the old shooter to make it look better than ever. This means remaking many props and assets to be higher quality, replacing textures with new ones that react properly to lights, and much, much more. It’s honestly one of the best looking remasters I’ve ever seen. </p><p>Nvidia says <em>Half-Life 2 RTX </em>is still in early development, so no idea when we’ll get a chance to play this mod. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://store.steampowered.com/app/2477290/HalfLife_2_RTX/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2477290/HalfLife_2_RTX/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">You can now find a new Steam page</a></span> for the mod on Valve’s storefront, which shows that while Valve isn’t officially involved, they are cool with the project. (<span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.eurogamer.net/valve-gives-black-mesa-permission-to-be-a-commercial-product&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/valve-gives-black-mesa-permission-to-be-a-commercial-product" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Which isn’t surprising at all</a></span>.) </p><p>Now, if you’ll excuse me, I’m going to watch that trailer again and dream of playing <em>HL2 RTX </em>while trying to not think about how old the game is in 2024. </p><p> .<br></p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
