We expect to take Spectre offline within the next 30 days, but we plan on disabling new purchases and refunding money spent since Season 1 launch via the platforms.”</p><p>Released last September on PC and promoted in association with former <em>Counter-Strike</em> pro and 2019 content creator of the year, Michael “Shroud” Grzesiek, <em>Spectre Divide</em>’s unique twist on the tactical shooter formula was the ability for each player to deploy two fighters onto the battlefield at once and then swap between them while setting or diffusing explosives.</p><p>It was a cool idea with a colorful art style that probably needed more runway to iterate and evolve in response to player feedback. Unfortunately, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.gamesindustry.biz/mountaintop-raises-another-30-million&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/mountaintop-raises-another-30-million" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">despite a $30 million investment round</a></span> as recently as January 2024 and a influx of new players with the recent launch of season 1: Flashpoint on consoles, <em>Spectre Divide</em> didn’t even live long enough to see its one-year anniversary. </p><p>“We were optimistic about the first week,” Mitchell wrote. “We’ve had ~400,000 players play, with a peak concurrent player count of ~10,000 across all platforms. But as time has gone on, we haven’t seen enough active players and incoming revenue to cover the day-to-day costs of <em>Spectre</em> and the studio.”</p><p>Mountaintop Studios, which boasted veteran talent from Naughty Dog, Respawn Entertainment, and other AAA studios, employed over 70 staff according to LinkedIn. “We pursued every avenue to keep going, including finding a publisher, additional investment, and/or an acquisition,” Mitchell wrote. “In the end, we weren’t able to make it work. The industry is in a tough spot right now.  This is a painful update to share. We love <em>Spectre</em>, and we’re incredibly proud of what we built with this community.”<br></p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

You begin with a township. A town is a small settlement, held back by its size, incapable of fielding multiple specialists or building certain structures.

All of my income, my military units, and my borders remain within my reach, and I can send reactionary forces at a moment’s notice. But if you’d prefer to play wide, you’ll quickly learn that <em>Civilization VII</em> revitalized its city system to include towns, which you may upgrade. But why would you want to? Cities come with additional costs and responsibilities, but there’s a purpose behind the madness.</p><p>In time, as you expand and bring in more gold, you can convert a town into a city—a central hub—where you may construct wonders, additional buildings, and even units. As such, it’s often best to spread your cities out but not too far; you want the ability to send units to the frontlines quickly.</p><p>So, why would you keep a town instead of upgrading to a city?</p><ul data-type="List" data-style="Bullet"><li>Towns produce goods and services culminating in gold, feeding your empire’s coffers each turn</li><li>A town requires less micromanagement, as you don’t need to constantly keep tabs on production and maintenance</li><li>You can specialize a town to focus on food, which is then distributed throughout your empire, allowing your cities to focus on the grand scheme instead of minute details, like sustenance and keeping people happy</li></ul><h2 id="h75768"><a id=""></a><strong>Types of town specializations</strong></h2><ul data-type="List" data-style="Bullet"><li><strong>Growing Town</strong>: Increases a town’s growth by 25 percent</li><li><strong>Fort Town</strong>: Additional healing to nearby units and +25 Health to Walls</li><li><strong>Urban Center</strong>: +1 Culture and Science with Quarters</li><li><strong>Farming Tow</strong>n: +1 Food to Farms, Pastures, Plantations, and Fishing Boats</li><li><strong>Mining Town</strong>: +1 Production to Camps, Woodcutters, Clay Pits, Mines, and Quarries</li><li><strong>Religious Site</strong>: +2 Happiness and +1 Relic Slot to Temples</li><li><strong>Hub Town</strong>: +2 Influence per Settlement connected to this town</li><li><strong>Trade Outpost</strong>: +2 Happiness per Resource tile in the town and +5 Trade Route range</li></ul><h2 id="h75769"><a id=""></a><strong>How and why to upgrade a town to a city</strong></h2><figure id="" data-id="45f1aa716e18848466886abb3e4d8f71" data-recommend-id="image://45f1aa716e18848466886abb3e4d8f71" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The upgrade details to convert a town to a city in Civilization VII." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="The upgrade details to convert a town to a city in Civilization VII." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Firaxis Games / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="45f1aa716e18848466886abb3e4d8f71" data-recommend-id="image://45f1aa716e18848466886abb3e4d8f71" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The upgrade details to convert a town to a city in Civilization VII." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>As you expand and progress, you’ll find that your towns stop growing. They’ll reach a certain point and halt further development. Then, you can upgrade from a town to a city, but it requires a lot of gold depending on various modifiers. The maximum is 1,000 gold, and the minimum is around 200 gold.</p><p>Once you’ve built up a town and wish to convert to a city, select the town in question and scroll down in the production menu until you find “Convert to City.” This option will detail the total cost beforehand and warn you that it’s a permanent upgrade. If you’re satisfied with the gold requirements, click “Ok.”</p><p>The evolution is automatic!</p><hr><p>You can play <em>Civilization VII</em> now on PC, PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Xbox One, Xbox Series X|S, and Nintendo Switch.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
