              <p><span>I don’t pay much attention to Logan Paul, the content creator turned wrestler with side hustles that involve turning </span><i><span>Pokémon </span></i><span>cards </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/logan-paul-most-valuable-pokemon-card-auction-2000656107"><span>into heartless cash grabs</span></a><span> and a </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/youtube-logan-paul-cryptozoo-nft-game-refund-lawsuit-1851143787"><span>failed NFT game</span></a><span>. But the social media persona entered my field of view last night after making </span><a href="https://x.com/LoganPaul/status/2008546103965479046"><span>a now viral post</span></a><span> pitching his idea for a </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-legends-za-review-switch-2-bugs-performance-2000637719"><span>new </span><i><span>Pokémon </span></i><span>game</span></a><span>. Well, “new” is a stretch, considering what he’s asking for is essentially another fucking remake of the original </span><i><span>Pokémon Red </span></i><span>and </span><i><span>Blue</span></i><span> games. But having been in the series’ vicinity for almost 30 years, I know that this is the type of artless pitch lapsed and casual </span><i><span>Pokémon </span></i><span>fans would happily gobble down like Moomoo Milk.</span></p> <p><span>Pushing aside with all our might that this reads like a pitch to Game Freak that was probably written by ChatGPT (“nostalgic equity” is a phrase no human has ever said), let’s look at what Paul is actually asking for.</span></p> <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">Idea for The Pokémon Company:</p> <p>I think there is a MASSIVE opportunity to capitalize on the decades of nostalgic equity that fans have with the franchise</p> <p>The same frenzy that originally propelled Pokémon into mainstream culture lives within millions of adults that yearn for the…</p> <p>— Logan Paul (@LoganPaul) <a href="https://twitter.com/LoganPaul/status/2008279181080109173?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 5, 2026</a></p></blockquote>  <p><span>He says that The Pokémon Company has a “massive opportunity” to bank on nostalgia, as if Pikachu and friends have ever not taken the opportunity to shove the original Kanto starters into something over the past 30 years. He also mentions how, every few years, he’ll boot up the original games on a Game Boy to find “just as much joy” playing back through them as he had as a child.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><span>He then admits he doesn’t have “much of a connection” to newer Pokémon, which is where he begins to give the game away. He does like Annihilape and Baxcalibur, suggesting he’s not completely out of the loop. But since he doesn’t really seem to care about anything Pokémon has done in the last 27 years, he argues it would be cool for Game Freak to create “remastered” versions of the Generation I Game Boy games, with “adaptive NPCs that evolve alongside the player.”</span></p>

 <p><span>He says they could even use modern technology to let players connect to the internet for trading and battling, something Pokémon has literally been doing for 20 years, ever since </span><i><span>Diamond</span></i><span> and </span><i><span>Pearl </span></i><span>on the DS. He goes on:</span></p> <blockquote><p><span>This will do three things</span></p> <p><span>1.) Give older fans a chance to relive their childhood thus awakening a massive, dormant demographic&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>2.) Give newer, younger fans a taste of what originally made the franchise so special</span></p> <p><span>3.) Bridge the gap for older fans who don’t connect with newer Pokémon in a way that’s familiar to them</span></p> <p><span>If we believe that video game cycles are like a pendulum, the near-future of gaming may birth a desire for more simplified, block-based aesthetics. We already see it happening with games like Minecraft &amp; Roblox. As technology continues to advance at an alarmingly rapid pace, I personally believe the future will lean towards “retro”</span></p></blockquote> <p><span>This LinkedIn-ass post tries to intellectualize what is obvious nostalgia-pining as some kind of market inevitability; that it would just be good business sense for </span><i><span>Pokémon </span></i><span>to go back to Kanto for the people who only played those original games decades ago, outgrew them, and now think the problem is that the all-ages franchise has fallen “behind the times.” Also, crucially, Game Freak already remade those original games twice with </span><i><span>FireRed</span></i><span>/</span><i><span>LeafGreen </span></i><span>and the </span><i><span>Let’s Go </span></i><span>games on Switch, the latter of which are only seven years old.</span></p>

 <p><span>Yes, the original </span><i><span>Red </span></i><span>and </span><i><span>Blue </span></i><span>are still the best-selling games in the franchise, and maybe some people are too young to realize that the level of Pokémania back then was far beyond the still massive success </span><i><span>Pokémon </span></i><span>enjoys right now. To insinuate that </span><i><span>Pokémon </span></i><span>is in danger of getting away from its base of ‘90s kids, though, is like saying the sun isn’t shining because you’re inside and can’t feel its warmth. But this is the sentiment of a lot of retired Pokémon trainers who stopped playing in elementary school and mistake their own lack of interest for the series no longer having the sauce.</span></p>

 <p><span>It’s the same mentality that makes people mad that </span><i><span>Scarlet </span></i><span>and </span><i><span>Violet </span></i><span>have “regular animals” in them like Flamigo when </span><i><span>Red </span></i><span>and </span><i><span>Blue </span></i><span>had Seel, or who didn’t like that Gen V and VI had Pokémon made of “objects” when Grimer and Voltorb were literal sludge and a living Poké Ball. </span><i><span>Pokémon </span></i><span>made me feel something specific as a child, and now that I’m an adult and my brain has developed differently, I don’t feel that way anymore. Instead of the realities of adulthood crushing my spirit, it must be because the </span><i><span>Pokémon </span></i><span>games don’t have Professor Oak and Misty in them all the time.</span></p>

 <p><span>If all you’re looking at is video game sales numbers, you probably could foolishly think </span><i><span>Pokémon </span></i><span>is “struggling” in the market compared to what it hit in the ‘90s, despite the absolute trashfire that was </span><i><span>Scarlet </span></i><span>and </span><i><span>Violet</span></i><span> still readily selling around 27 million copies, a number any other company would kill to hit. But </span><i><span>Pokémon </span></i><span>is a lifestyle brand that makes most of its money from </span><a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/pokemon-has-become-the-highest-grossing-media-franchise-of-all-time/"><span>merchandise sales</span></a><span>, and you would think someone who played a major role in inflating the value of the trading cards would know that.</span></p>

 <p><span>Honestly, if people like Paul want something that feels just like the old games did when they were five, try a ROM hack. Fans have been making retro-style </span><i><span>Pokémon </span></i><span>games for decades. They’re not only great, they’ll probably also make you feel cozy-wozy with their pixelated graphics that look like what you played on your Game Boy. And hey, you can probably find plenty that don’t include all the hundreds of new Pokémon you don’t like, but which millions of younger players grew up on and hold as dear as old-timers do Pikachu or Charmander.</span></p> <p><span>This yearning for the mines of Kanto exists around the periphery of </span><i><span>Pokémon </span></i><span>every day, and it’s only going to ratchet up more this year with the series’ 30th anniversary celebrations <a href="https://x.com/pokemon_cojp/status/2006379822012911872?s=46&amp;t=ELmQU9gVKk7kgACkfTFs1Q">already paying tribute to those old games</a>. ROM hacks, mock-ups from people who don’t even like the games anymore, and even fan art are constantly gesturing at the series’ old aesthetics. I still have my original copy of </span><i><span>Pokémon Yellow </span></i><span>sitting on my shelf to this day, and maybe if Game Freak releases those old games on Switch this year, I’ll play it again.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>But I don’t need The Pokémon Company to keep looking back. And the company certainly doesn’t need to tap into a “massive,” untapped well of fair-weather fans who will come back to the franchise for good if they remake </span><i><span>Red </span></i><span>and </span><i><span>Blue </span></i><span>again. I think it’ll live.</span></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>A player who goes by Quinten was on their way to securing a <a href="https://kotaku.com/roblox-new-york-times-interview-baszucki-2000646174">Guinness World Record in Roblox</a> when they were beat out at the last moment by multiple speedruns that were so good, they seemed humanly impossible. A lesser player might have gone back to gambling on the Roblox ponies, but Quinten instead set out to prove that the new records were bogus. It worked.</p> <p>As <em><a href="https://www.pcgamesn.com/roblox/guiness-world-record-cheat">PCGamesN</a></em><a href="https://www.pcgamesn.com/roblox/guiness-world-record-cheat"> reports,</a>&nbsp;Quinten was competing for the world record in a Roblox game called <em>Ultimate Easy Obby</em> that has <a href="https://www.roblox.com/games/10760024537/Ultimate-Easy-Obby">over 100,000 reviews</a>. It’s a zany, single-player obstacle course similar to something you might find in <a href="https://kotaku.com/there-s-a-new-type-of-fall-guys-jackass-1846537028"><em>Fall Guys</em></a> and was published by Roblox in partnership with the Guinness World Record company. Last month, Quinten secured a time of 05:48:96 following an “insane back-and-forth battle” with another Roblox speedrunner. It was the result of tons of time spent “optimizing every corner and jump,” the 18-year-old Belgian wrote on Reddit.</p>

 <p>But then something bizarre happened. Quinten’s speedrun record was quickly beaten by three other random Roblox accounts. And not just by a little bit but six whole seconds. “For context: a 6-second gap on a speedrun this optimized is physically impossible,” they wrote. “It was heartbreaking to see a week of grinding ruined by scripts.” Undeterred, Quinten decided to speedrun an investigation into the mysterious rivals to find proof of the suspected cheating.</p>

  <p>This evidence fell into three main buckets. The first was bogus time stamps. <em>Ultimate Easy Obby</em> features a linear obstacle course consisting of 50 stages, but some of the mystery accounts’ timestamps were out of order. The new world record holder was also missing a “digital receipt” of ever having actually completed the race. “This proved he never actually touched the finish line trigger; he likely teleported a coordinate script to the end-game lobby, bypassing the verification check,” Quinten wrote.</p>

 <p>But the real nail in the coffin was painstaking frame-by-frame analysis of Quinten’s own best recorded time to show that shaving six seconds off it would be impossible. “I took my best run and calculated the theoretical maximum time save possible (perfect pixels, zero drag),” they wrote. “Even with a TAS (Tool-Assisted Speedrun) level of perfection, the times the cheaters posted were mathematically impossible within the game’s physics engine.”</p>

 <p>Surprisingly, it all worked. The evidence was submitted to Guinness which then went back, reviewed the records, and re-validated Quinten’s as the true World Record. “It felt amazing to successfully lobby a major organization to reverse verified records based on user-submitted digital forensics,” they wrote. The king of <em>Ultimate Easy Obby&nbsp;</em>can once again rest easy knowing at least one more small sliver of fraud has been carved out of Roblox.</p>

              <p>While the first two games added to Xbox Game Pass in January might not knock your socks off, it’s what’s coming later this month that should bring some New Year cheer. By January 13, Game Pass subscribers will have access to Ubisoft’s enormously underrated <em>Star Wars Outlaws</em>, and just a week later the stunning&nbsp;<em>Resident Evil Village</em> brings our favorite tall lady to the service.</p> <p>Added today, January 6, are drunken twin-stick shooter <em>Brews &amp; Bastards&nbsp;</em>(no, me neither, but I’ll be installing it this evening) and <em>Little Nightmares Enhanced Edition.&nbsp;</em>Then as soon as tomorrow, last year’s underdog first-person action game <em>Atomfall</em> will be added to the subscription platform, alongside 2025 roguelite sequel <em>Lost in Random: The Eternal Die</em>, online multiplayer soccer sim&nbsp;<em>Rematch</em>, and&nbsp;<em>Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine</em>‘s&nbsp;<em>Master Crafted Edition</em>, hopefully now fixed <a href="https://kotaku.com/warhammer-40k-space-marine-master-crafted-refunds-ps5-1851785318">from all its many issues on launch</a>.</p>

 <p>Then, but another day later, we get the original&nbsp;<em>Final Fantasy</em> in its 2024 “remodeled” version, seemingly plucked from the&nbsp;<a href="https://kotaku.com/final-fantasy-pixel-remaster-xbox-tokyo-game-show-1851658451"><em>Final Fantasy Pixel Remaster</em></a><a href="https://kotaku.com/final-fantasy-pixel-remaster-xbox-tokyo-game-show-1851658451"> bundle</a>.</p> <p>You’ll have to somehow wait another five days, until January 13, before the next update, when <em>Star Wars Outlaws</em> arrives, and hopefully a whole new raft of people can discover this fantastic open-galaxy criminal ’em up, after it suffered from both a buggy launch and a concerted anti-woke campaign from the worst people on the internet. Seriously, if you were put off by any of the noise during its 2024 release, this is a great chance to put that right. The stealth is&nbsp;<em>so&nbsp;</em>much better now.</p>

 <p>After&nbsp;<em>My Little Pony: A Zephyr Heights Mystery</em> shows up Jan 15, on the 20th arrives <a href="https://kotaku.com/ikumi-nakamura-sentenced-to-horny-jail-for-lady-dimit-1846919932">Lady Dimitrescu</a> in her size 25s via 2021’s <em>Resident Evil Village</em>, alongside metroidvania platformer <em>MIO: Memories in Orbit</em>, a day-one release.</p> <p>Microsoft giveth, but Microsoft taketh away, so to get all these new games we must sacrifice a bunch too. I don’t imagine too many tears will be shed over the five titles going away on January 15, however, all listed below. Here’s everything in one handy, bullet-pointed list:</p> <h2>January 6</h2> <ul> <li><em>Brews &amp; Bastards</em> (Cloud, PC, Xbox Series)</li> <li><em>Little Nightmares Enhanced Edition</em> (Cloud, Handheld, PC, Xbox Series)</li> </ul> <h2>January 7</h2> <ul> <li><em>Atomfall</em> (Cloud, Console, Handheld, PC)</li> <li><em>Lost in Random: The Eternal Die</em> (Cloud, Xbox Series, Handheld, PC)</li> <li><em>Rematch</em> (Cloud, PC, Xbox Series)</li> <li><em>Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine – Master Crafted Edition</em> (Cloud, PC, Xbox Series)</li> </ul> <h2>January 8</h2> <ul> <li><em>Final Fantasy</em> (Cloud, Xbox Series, PC)</li> </ul> <h2>January 15</h2> <ul> <li><em>My Little Pony: A Zephyr Heights Mystery&nbsp;</em>(Cloud, Console, Handheld, PC)</li> </ul> <h2>January 20</h2> <p><em>Resident Evil Village</em> (Cloud, Console, PC)</p> <p><em>MIO: Memories in Orbit</em> (Cloud, Handheld, PC, Xbox Series)</p> <h2>Leaving January 15</h2> <ul> <li><em>Flintlock: The Siege of Dawn </em>(Cloud, Handheld, PC, and Xbox Series X|S)</li> <li><em>Neon White&nbsp;</em>(Cloud, Console, Handheld, and PC)</li> <li><em>Road 96&nbsp;</em>(Cloud, Console, Handheld, and PC)</li> <li><em>The Ascent&nbsp;</em>(Cloud, Console, Handheld, and PC)</li> <li><em>The Grinch Christmas Adventures&nbsp;</em>(Cloud, Console, Handheld, and PC)</li> </ul>
