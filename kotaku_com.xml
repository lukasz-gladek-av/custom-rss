There hasn’t been a truly new entry in the series since 2014's <em>Mario Kart 8</em>, so being stoked to dive into this exciting adventure is perfectly reasonable. Equally reasonable, especially given the game’s controversial price tag, is to wonder how long it’ll take to beat and what type of replayability it offers. Let’s talk about it.</p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="195905" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="Three Things We Learned From The Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth Demo " data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="121" data-playlist="195905,196599,195519" data-current="195905"><div><p>Three Things We Learned From The Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth Demo </p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195905/195905_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195905/195905_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195905/195905_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195905/195905_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/21419.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><h2 id="h216888"><a id=""></a>How long does it take to beat <em>Mario Kart World</em>?</h2><p><em>Mario Kart World</em> is a racing game first and foremost, so that’s what you can expect to spend a lot of time doing. But if your goal is simply to tackle all of the game’s races and call it quits, <strong>you can complete every Grand Prix cup in just a few hours of playtime</strong>. You’ll probably find the experience lacking, though, as that’s only a small part of what Nintendo’s newest entry in the franchise serves up. </p><p><em>Mario Kart </em>games are known for having an extremely long lifespan due to their seemingly endless replayability. If you thoroughly enjoy racing in <em>Mario Kart World</em>, you can continue to replay its tracks as many times as you’d like via time trials or offline tournaments by yourself or via split-screen multiplayer.</p><p>Alternatively, you can head online to race up to 24 players in a standard Grand Prix or Knockout Mode, the latter of which is a brand-new elimination-based showdown. If you’re feeling feisty, you may want to take to the Battle Mode to fight your pals in a silly arena fight to see who can defeat each other with items. With all of this to do with friends (or strangers, if you’re so inclined), <strong><em>Mario Kart World</em> will likely keep you busy for many months, or even years, after release. </strong></p><p>If you’re more interested in exploring the game’s open world, you can do so entirely alone, or you can team up with your pals in a free roam session to explore it together. You’ll be able to round up plenty of collectibles or engage in dozens and dozens of short-but-sweet P-Switch missions—though it’s worth noting that the latter is strangely absent in cooperative free roam, so you’ll have to do those all by yourself. Sorry!</p><p>If this new kart racing outing sounds like fun to you,<em> Mario Kart World</em> is available now exclusively on Nintendo Switch 2.</p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Yeah, you need a more standard controller, my friend. Fortunately, there are a handful to choose from even this early in the console’s life.</p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="197565" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="Nintendo Switch 2 Could Launch With Almost No Reviews" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="122" data-playlist="197565,197567,197533" data-current="197565"><div><p>Nintendo Switch 2 Could Launch With Almost No Reviews</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197565/197565_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197565/197565_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197565/197565_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/23089.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>The best controller for you will always come down to the one that matches your budget, the features you need, and what feels most comfortable in your hand. But I’ve been taking a look at some Nintendo Switch 2 controllers, and I think these three are the best choices in order from most to least expensive. Maybe there’s one here that will tickle your fancy. </p><h2 id="h315388"><a id="1"></a>The king reigns supreme: Nintendo Switch 2 Pro Controller</h2><p>Nintendo Switch 2 Pro Controller may be pricey as hell, but it is hands down the best controller you can buy for your Nintendo Switch 2 right now. For its high asking price, you can rest assured that it has every feature needed to make the most of your gameplay experience on your new console. So, if you’ve got the dough, it’s definitely worth the investment.</p><figure id="" data-id="c8d0b5c046c34a9fe1d3fd071660950a" data-recommend-id="image://c8d0b5c046c34a9fe1d3fd071660950a" data-format="jpg" data-width="1705" data-height="946" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A Switch 2 Pro Controller." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A Switch 2 Pro Controller." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="false" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Photo<!-- -->: <!-- -->Nintendo</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="c8d0b5c046c34a9fe1d3fd071660950a" data-recommend-id="image://c8d0b5c046c34a9fe1d3fd071660950a" data-format="jpg" data-width="1705" data-height="946" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A Switch 2 Pro Controller." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>The Nintendo Switch 2 Pro Controller comes with mappable back buttons, HD Rumble 2, gyro controls, amiibo support, and a dedicated C button for GameChat. It’s a complete feature set that third-party controllers can’t always lay claim to. But most of all, it’s likely the most comfortable controller I’ve ever held. I adore how smooth the sticks move, how clicky the buttons are, and how the two back buttons rest at just the right spot where they’re easily accessible without making me feel like I might click them accidentally. The controller borders on perfection.</p><p>If I had any real complaint about Nintendo’s newest controller, though, it wouldn’t be about anything functional. Instead, I simply wish the company would offer more colorways than black. Nintendo has frequently embraced quirky, colorful hardware, so I’m hoping we’ll eventually see some unique colors pop up down the line. </p><h2 id="h315389"><a id="2"></a>Let’s get fashionable: Turtle Beach Rematch Wireless Controller</h2><p>My favorite third-party Nintendo Switch 2 controller to use has been the Turtle Beach Rematch Wireless Controller. Officially licensed by Nintendo, this controller comes sporting basically all of the things I want in a controller, and at a lower price than the Switch 2 Pro Controller.</p><figure id="" data-id="d34d157438e3b52f971865e8d8efc59f" data-recommend-id="image://d34d157438e3b52f971865e8d8efc59f" data-format="jpg" data-width="2308" data-height="1183" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A wireless controller has Mario on it." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A wireless controller has Mario on it." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="false" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Turtle Beach</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="d34d157438e3b52f971865e8d8efc59f" data-recommend-id="image://d34d157438e3b52f971865e8d8efc59f" data-format="jpg" data-width="2308" data-height="1183" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A wireless controller has Mario on it." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>You get up to 40 hours of playtime on a charge, built-in gyro controls, mappable back buttons, and satisfyingly grippy thumbsticks. It’s just killer all-around, honestly, and feels wonderful in the hands. Even more, it’s a hell of a looker with some neat aesthetic flair. Whether you choose the Invincible Mario (pictured above) or the Super Mario Star version, you’re getting a visually fun controller that also glows in the damn dark! And look, I know I’m almost 40, but don’t judge me for embracing some childlike wonder to offset the doom and gloom in the world these days.</p><p>Unfortunately, because it was initially designed for the original Nintendo Switch,<strong> the Turtle Beach Rematch Wireless Controller lacks a dedicated C button for GameChat</strong>, so you’ll need to access that feature from the UI instead. I also wish it provided amiibo support, but that’s life.</p><h2 id="h315390"><a id="3"></a>Rippin’ on a budget: PowerA Advantage Wired Controller</h2><p>Whether you’re on a budget or simply prefer wired controllers, the PowerA Advantage Wired Controller is a beast at only $40. It comes packing Nintendo Switch 2-specific features like programmable back buttons and a C button for accessing GameChat. And its 10ft wire is plenty long enough that you should be able to kick back on the couch and relax while playing your favorite games.</p><figure id="" data-id="f5623d3e6674091e82b7bacea76edca4" data-recommend-id="image://f5623d3e6674091e82b7bacea76edca4" data-format="jpg" data-width="1562" data-height="967" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A wired controller with Mario on it." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A wired controller with Mario on it." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="false" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->PowerA</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="f5623d3e6674091e82b7bacea76edca4" data-recommend-id="image://f5623d3e6674091e82b7bacea76edca4" data-format="jpg" data-width="1562" data-height="967" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A wired controller with Mario on it." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>The disadvantages of the PowerA Advantage Wired Controller are that it’s missing HD Rumble, motion controls, and amiibo support. If any of that is a dealbreaker for you, you’re probably better off saving up for the Nintendo Switch 2 Pro Controller, I reckon.</p><p>The PowerA Advantage Wired Controller comes in a few different neat versions, including a sleek all-black edition and two Nintendo-themed versions that really stand out. I dig the Mario Time controller in the picture above, but I’d say it’s nice to have options.</p><p>.  </p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

You’ve probably traveled to this area while hunting either monster, as they’ll commonly move to this nest once they’ve taken enough damage.</p><h2 id="h704972"><a id=""></a>How to Deliver Wyvern Eggs</h2><figure id="" data-id="e38e8b6ad4fbb37727b30c1a70c94941" data-recommend-id="image://e38e8b6ad4fbb37727b30c1a70c94941" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A hunter carries a Wyvern Egg through a colorful forest and towards a red pop-up camp." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A hunter carries a Wyvern Egg through a colorful forest and towards a red pop-up camp." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Capcom / Samuel Moreno / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="e38e8b6ad4fbb37727b30c1a70c94941" data-recommend-id="image://e38e8b6ad4fbb37727b30c1a70c94941" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A hunter carries a Wyvern Egg through a colorful forest and towards a red pop-up camp." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Collecting eggs has its fair share of obstacles. For example, your movement is while carrying these things. You’re also unable to jump from most ledges or roll. Trying to do any of these will break the egg. As if that wasn’t inconvenient enough, <strong>picking up a Wyvern Egg can instantly aggro any Rathian or Rathalos on the map</strong>. They’ll fly right towards you and begin their assault, which will likely result in them breaking the egg you’re carrying.</p><p>Luckily for you, the right tools and planning will make this a trivial matter. Here’s what you need to pull off a Wyvern Egg heist:</p><ul data-type="List" data-style="Bullet"><li><strong>Ghillie Mantle</strong>: Equipping this will prevent any monsters from seeing you during the trek back to camp. More importantly, it also prevents any large dragons from being alerted by your theft. Keep in mind that they will begin hunting you as soon as the Mantle stops working</li><li><strong>Outdoorsman Skill</strong>: Although its description only vaguely mentions improving transportation, this cancels out most of the movement drawbacks. You’ll have faster movement, dodging/rolling available, and jumping off a ledge will no longer break the egg. The Ranger Jewel decoration is the easiest way to apply this skill. Otherwise, you’ll either need to collect Gajau fish to forge Gajau Boots or complete Alma’s glasses sidequest to forge Square Glasses</li><li><strong>Area 12: Northeast Pop-up Camp</strong>: One welcomed improvement in <em>Monster Hunter Wilds</em> is that Wyvern Eggs don’t need to be delivered to your main camp. This is arguably the closest pop-up camp with the relatively safest conditions. Area 7: Bower of the Great Tree is another option, but it frequently has monsters nearby</li></ul><p>You can take out any Rathian or Rathalos on the map first if you want the absolute safest egg trip. I suggest checking the map’s Environment Overview Forecast beforehand to make sure you’ll have enough time before another one spawns in.</p><p>Before we start, you’re going to want to set up a waypoint to the nearest Pop-up Camp. This will help if you’re not as familiar with the map or accidentally get lost moving through this giant forest. Holding L1/LB for about a second will cause your scoutflies to head towards the waypoint, leaving a visible trail for you to follow.</p><p>Once you’re in the nest, equip the Ghillie Mantle and pick up the Wyvern Egg. Head north where a long set of vines lead down to another tree top. You might need to be walking straight towards it to slowly climb down these, which is a common reason players get stuck up here. If you have the Outdoorsman Skill in your build, feel free to just run right off. Your hunter will safely land with the egg intact. Keep moving forward to find an even longer set of vines you can climb or jump off from.</p><p>Now that you’re on the ground, you’ll want to turn right and move towards the giant mess of mossy rocks. Follow the water that goes around the left of this, and you’ll see the Pop-up Camp as soon as you round the corner. You’ll successfully deliver the egg once you approach the camp and see an animation of you placing the egg down.</p><p>Your reward is 50 Guild Points, which admittedly isn’t a lot. Previous entries had special egg delivery quests, so it makes sense that the rewards aren’t great without anything like that. Fingers crossed they add some in the future to give incentive for doing this. For now, it’s more or less a <em>Monster Hunter Wilds</em> easter egg.</p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
