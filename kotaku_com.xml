              <p>For all the Android-heads out there, you can upgrade whatever you’re working with now to the Samsung Galaxy Z Flip7 for a discounted price.<a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3984/"> At this time, Samsung’s seventh generation flippable smartphone has dropped by 14% for the base storage option and by 12% for the large storage option</a>. The 256GB Galaxy smartphone is down from $1,100 to $950, saving you $150. Likewise, the 512GB model is down from $1,220 to $1,070, also saving you $150. Amazon has three color options all on sale. Choose between blue shadow, coral red, or jet black.</p>
<p>Samsung first launched it flippable and foldable lines of smartphones back in 2020. If you’ve been afraid to jump on as an early adopter before the kinks have all been worked at, well now we’re on the seventh generation. It’s got quite a bit of updates since then so now’s a good time to get on board.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3984/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<p>When closed, the Samsung Galaxy Z Flip7 can display the time, date, your notifications, and other brief details across its edge-to-edge cover screen.</p>
<p>Take hand-free selfies. Just open the Flip7 at a 90-degree angle so it can stand itself up. now you can use the outer camera lenses to take high-quality selfies (higher than front-facing cameras tend to be). Even use it for recording videos or taking video calls as you’re able to see your video and your callers video thanks to the cover screen. The outside features a 12MP ultra-wide lens as well as a 50MP wide lens capable of 2x optical quality zoom. If you still want to use the inside main camera, that one is 10MP.</p>



<h2>Flip Without Fear</h2>
<p>Now I’d understand your main concern with a flip phone being it’s durability. Plenty of flip phones snapped at their hinges back in the day, so how does the Flip7 hold up? Well, it’s built with Armor FlexHinge which is designed to close thinner while protecting the phone’s hinge. There are seven generations of iteration and innovation at play here. Additionally, it’s protected with Corning Gorilla Glass Victus 2 and is encased in a strong yet light Armor Aluminum frame.</p>
<p>Though, the most underrated feature is being to hang up dramatically. When’s the last time you yell “Good day!” through the phone and then slammed it shut. Gently pressing the End Call button just doesn’t have the same oomph.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3984/">Get yourself the Samsung Galaxy Flip7 in three stylish colors for $150 off for a limited time</a>. The 256GB model is down to $950 while the 512GB model is down to $1,070.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Small gaming accessory maker Genki <a href="https://kotaku.com/nintendo-switch-2-rumors-genki-ces-2025-official-1851736830">made a big splash at this year’s CES</a> after it flaunted a mockup of the Switch 2 on the show floor at the expo. Nintendo turned around and sued in May, accusing the company behind carrying cases and Joy-Con grips of infringing on its trademarks by using the hype around leaks to market accessories for the upcoming hardware. This week, the two sides reached a “confidential settlement” that, among other things, bars Genki from ever calling one of its promotional livestreams a “Direct.”</p> <p>“[Genki is permanently enjoined from] using the terms ‘Glitch,’ ‘Glitch 2,’ ‘Genki Direct,’ ‘Genki Indirect,’ or any other similar rebranding or approximation of Nintendo’s intellectual property, products, product names, characters, presentations, or marks; i.e. for any accessories compatible or marketed for use with Nintendo’s products, implementing product packaging, product designs, and product descriptions that fail to make clear to consumers Genki’s status as an unlicensed accessory manufacturer,” reads <a href="https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.cacd.969015/gov.uscourts.cacd.969015.30.1.pdf">part of the agreement</a>&nbsp;ordered on September 8. Genki also agreed to “payment in an agreed-upon amount” in the “confidential settlement” with Nintendo.</p> <p>The legal dispute stems from Genki’s CES 2025 antics which included not just a 3D-printed replica of the Switch 2 for showing off accessories but also the accessory manufacturer’s claims that it had based the designs on access to a genuine piece of Nintendo’s then-unrevealed hardware. The stunt seemingly forced Nintendo’s hand, and the company, <a href="https://kotaku.com/switch-2-reveal-trailer-date-nintendo-mario-kart-9-1851739487">amid a flurry of other leaks</a>, ended up officially teasing the new console later that month ahead of a full Nintendo Direct dedicated to the Switch 2 in April.</p>

 <p>When the Mario maker hit back in May with a trademark infringement lawsuit, Genki wrote in a statement, “What we can say is this: Genki has always been an independent company focused on building innovative gaming accessories for the community we love. We’re proud of the work we’ve done, and we stand by the quality and originality of our products.” The Switch 2 versions of some of those products <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/08/after-some-early-issues-genki-has-finally-upgraded-select-switch-2-accessories">had minor issues</a> at launch but have since been revised.</p> <p>Was pissing off Nintendo worth it to get the world’s attention for Joy-Con grips and carrying cases? Without knowing the secret terms of the settlement, it’s hard to guess. But Genki is clearly taking it seriously now. The box for the Attack Vector Swappable Grip Case for the Switch 2 carries the following fine print disclaimer on the back: “Attack Vector is not affiliated with, sponsored by, or endorsed by Nintendo.”</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/beats-studio-buds-return-to-record-low-as-apple-clears-shelf-space-for-airpods-pro-3-2000624148</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/beats-studio-buds-return-to-record-low-as-apple-clears-shelf-space-for-airpods-pro-3.1292454/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Trick or Treat season is here so why not <em>treat yourself</em> to something special? Everyone deserves a solid pair of earbuds —especially a set with noise-cancellation. What used to be a luxury is now an assumed standard as the cost of the tech has come down. Take a look at these Beats Studio Buds+. They’re normally priced at $170, but right now are part of a 41% discount. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3983/">You’ll save $70 and then these active noise-cancelling earbuds can be yours for just under $100.</a></p>
<p>The great news is all four color options are part of the sale. You can choose between ivory, cosmic silver, transparent, or black/gold (yes that last one is one color). I’m particularly fond of the transparent colorway. Brings me back to a time when all tech was see through. This once futuristic style of tech is now nostalgic. Funny how that happens.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3983/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Turn off the World Around You</h2>
<p>The Beats Studio Buds+ support two listening modes. <strong>Active Noise Cancellation</strong> will silence the sounds coming from your surrounding environment. This way, you hear only what you want to hear whether that is music, the latest episode of a podcast, or the next chapter of your audiobook. When the time comes you need to hear those background noises again — suggest as a co-worker approaching with a pertinent question — you can flip back to Transparency Mode. This will allows outside noise to play through the earbuds’ speakers so you can stay aware of your surroundings.</p>
<p>These earbuds have a battery life that can keep up with you all day. When considering the charging case battery, the Beats Studio Buds+ will last you a full 36 hours.</p>



<p>Perfect for gym-goers, the Beats Studio Buds+ are sweat resistant. If your lifting weights or out for a run, these earbuds are designed to stay firmly in place and be able to withstand the elements. It comes with four different sizes of silicone tips so you can use the ones that fit perfectly to your ear shape.</p>
<p>With Bluetooth, you can connect the Beats Studio Buds+ quickly and easily to your phone, laptop, or tablet. With newer phones and other devices, you can pair the earbuds with a simple touch. No holding a button down and scrolling through settings to establish a connection.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3983/">For a limited time, you can save 41% on the Beats Studio Buds +, getting a pair for just under $100.</a> They’re down from $170 so you’d be saving a good $70.</p>
