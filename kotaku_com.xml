            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://kotaku.com/pokemon-year-of-eevee-prismatic-evolutions-plush-1851732914<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Step aside Luigi, 2025 is now officially the Year of Eevee. That’s the rather bold claim made today on the official <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.pokemoncenter.com/en-gb/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.pokemoncenter.com/en-gb/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Pokémon Center UK website</a></span>, and likely to come to the <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.pokemoncenter.com/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.pokemoncenter.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">U.S. version later today</a></span>. What does it mean? Well, the TCG is about to launch a new special set of cards called Prismatic Evolutions, all themed around the lil’ brown pup and its octet of evolved forms, with new products released throughout the whole year, and there’s a bunch of new Eevee merch on the store, but could it also be...?</p><p>Rumors of a new Eevee evolution are an ever-present part of <em>Pokémon</em> fandom, with the wee creature not having gained a new mature form since Sylveon (Fairy type) arrived in 2014's Gen VI. Ten years is the longest Eevee’s ever gone without gaining another—the Normal-type Pokémon  began in 1996 being able to turn into Vaporeon (Water), Jolteon (Electric), and Flareon (Fire), then in 1999 gained Espeon (Psychic) and Umbreon (Dark), and then Leafeon (Grass) and Glaceon (Ice) in 2006's Gen IV.</p><p>While the card game has since dropped Fairy types, and never had Ice, the video games have a wealth of potential types that could receive an additional eeveelution. Most obvious, especially given they <em>are</em> in the TCG, are Fighting, Metal/Steel, and Dragon. If these decisions were to ignore the TCG (where it would adopt something close enough, like Glaceon defaulting to another Water type), then there’s still Poison, Ground, Rock, Bug, or Ghost. Which is all to say, there’s no reason not to do it!</p><p>However, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.pokebeach.com/2025/01/prismatic-evolutions-set-guide-full-card-list-secret-rares-cut-cards-products-and-more&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.pokebeach.com/2025/01/prismatic-evolutions-set-guide-full-card-list-secret-rares-cut-cards-products-and-more" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">we do already know the full card list from January 17's Prismatic Evolutions special set of the Pokémon TCG</a></span>, given it’s formed from two sources—55 percent of it is reprints from 2024 sets, and the remaining 45 percent comes from Japanese sets Terastal Festival ex and ex Starter Deck Generations. And none of them is a new Eeveelution.</p><p>The set is already providing incredibly popular. Pre-order stock is selling out everywhere, and my attempt to pick up my usual ETB from the Pokémon Center proved impossible—it was sold out literally the moment it appeared on the New Releases page. However, given the set is due to release new products for the entire year, it seems likely this over-excitement will eventually wane.</p><p>What you <em>can</em> buy right now in the UK, and likely later today in the U.S., are a bunch of cute Eevee plushes. Of these, eight are brand new, added to the latest sub-category that’s confusingly not “Sitting Cuties,” rather called “Poké Doll.” There’s an Eevee, and one of each eeveelution (except Flareon?!), and they’re <em>super-</em>cute. Please, someone, stop me from doing something silly. (Also, Flareon? You OK?)</p><p>I’ve made a little gallery of them all, so click next to see all those.</p><p>In the meantime, let’s all wildly over-speculate that this very obvious marketing idea, with its own logo, is actually the beginning of a spectacular announcement of a Dragon-type Eevee to be revealed in this year’s <em>Pokémon Legends: Z-A</em>. Zulteon. Imagine if I got that right.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
