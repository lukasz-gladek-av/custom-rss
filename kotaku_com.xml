              <p>Now is a great time to stock up on gaming essentials, as we’re spotting quite a few top-rated accessories going for less at Amazon. One of our favorite discounts? <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6807/">This 31% drop on the Razer Basilisk V3 X HyperSpeed wireless gaming mouse, which brings its price down to just $48.</a></p>
<p>That’s basically nothing considering all the features this tiny but mighty mouse is packed with. This price also matches its all-time low from last year. Just be sure to pick it up before the offer expires, or the stock runs out.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6807/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Packs a Punch</h2>
<p>The mouse’s signature shape supports different grips, making it comfortable to use by just about anyone for a range of tasks, from gaming to creative work. The nine programmable controls make it easy to have all the commands you need just a click away – quite literally. This degree of personalized control lets you perform your best during both work and play sessions.</p>
<p>The low-latency performance makes the V3 faster than most options in the same range, while the Razer 5G advanced 18K optical sensor ensures 99.4% tracking accuracy with up to 18,000 DPI. Translation? Incredible precision and speed that gives you a competitive edge in action-packed games where every second counts. You can even improve the accuracy further by disabling the “Enhance pointer precision” option in the Windows mouse settings. Those looking for more control can use the Razer Synapse app for advanced customization.</p>



<p>Durability comes from new gold-plated contact points that make the switches less prone to degradation. You’ll appreciate the longer lifespan of up to 60 million clicks, which ensures you keep enjoying consistent performance for years to come.</p>
<p>Additionally, Razor Chroma RGBL integration lets you customize the mouse using 16.8 million colors and countless lighting effects. The mouse reacts dynamically with countless Chroma-integrated games for an immersive experience that makes you feel like a part of the action. Battery life is just as impressive. You’re looking at up to 535 hours on Bluetooth and 285 hours on Razer HyperSpeed wireless. Basically, you won’t have to worry about running out of power in the middle of teaching bag guys a lesson. This also makes the mouse easy (and reliable) to take with you on your trips. Game wherever you want, however you want!</p>
<p>The mouse is compatible with a range of devices and gadgets, so you can play on your preferred one with ease. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6807/">The Basilik V3 is now down to just $48, from its already-affordable $70 price</a>. If you’ve been looking to upgrade your gaming experience without breaking the bank, now is the time to make the move.</p>

              <p>A gremlin in Bungie’s backend was briefly trying to <a href="https://kotaku.com/marathon-runner-shells-trailer-abilities-bungie-2000660170">upsell <em>Marathon</em> players</a> on copies of<em> Destiny 2</em>. Players who tried to pre-order the upcoming extraction shooter ended up with <em>Destiny 2</em> sneaking onto their hard drives as well in what is one of the weirder digital installation bugs I’ve ever heard of.</p> <p>We know this was happening because Bungie publicly addressed it on X. “We’ve resolved an issue where<em> Destiny 2</em> would begin installing after pre-ordering <em>Marathon</em> on Steam,” the studio <a href="https://x.com/MarathonDevTeam/status/2013752445231305147">wrote</a>. “We have also resolved an issue where Collector’s Edition owners would receive an error when attempting to activate their game code on Steam.”</p>

 <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">We've resolved an issue where Destiny 2 would begin installing after pre-ordering Marathon on Steam. We have also resolved an issue where Collector's Edition owners would receive an error when attempting to activate their game code on Steam.</p> <p>— Marathon Development Team (@MarathonDevTeam) <a href="https://twitter.com/MarathonDevTeam/status/2013752445231305147?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 20, 2026</a></p></blockquote>  <p>But that hasn’t stopped players from having a field day with the mere idea that Bungie wanted so desperately to enroll new players in its sci-fi loot shooter that it was forcibly installing <em>Destiny 2</em> on people’s computers like a cracked rom site virus.&nbsp;“<em>Marathon</em> used so many <em>Destiny 2</em> assets that it automatically downloaded the game when people pre-ordered <em>Marathon</em>,” joked one person. “<em>Marathon</em> comes with malware,” joked another.</p> <p>While Bungie didn’t explain why this happened, it probably has something to do with the pre-order bonuses. Buying <em>Marathon</em> ahead of <a href="https://kotaku.com/marathon-release-date-trailer-leak-bungie-2000660975">its March 5 launch date</a> gives players free cosmetics for <em>Destiny 2</em>. Maybe a bug in the files was making it so the loot shooter would auto-download in order to register those rewards. Whatever the reason, it’s fixed now. <em>Destiny 2</em>, on the other hand, still not great.</p>

              <p>Ready to cut the cord and enjoy a hands-free, convenient viewing experience? A good streaming media player can help. Amazon’s Fire series features some of the best out there for users of all needs and budgets, and the retail giant is currently making the upgrade easy.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4111/">You can now pick the latest Fire TV Cube at a rare 21% discount at Amazon. This brings its price down to just $110.</a> If you have an older model lying around, you can trade it in for an additional 20% discount. Your purchase will also come with a one-month trial to the Xbox GamePass if you’re a new user, which sweetens the offer even more. The discount is selling out fast, though. If you’ve been looking for an easy way of streaming better, now is your chance to upgrade for less.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4111/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Easier Navigation</h2>
<p>Featuring the new octa-core 2.0 GHz processor, the Fire TV Cube packs impressive performance in a compact build. It’s twice as powerful as the high-rated and widely loved Fire TV Stick 4K Max, letting you search for stuff and navigate around a lot more easily. There’s Wi-Fi 6E support for smoother 4K streaming with less interference from other household devices, which translates into better speeds and lower latency. It also supports Dolby Vision, HDR, and Dolby Atmos audio. These come together to offer an immersive viewing experience for all your favorite shows and movies. Expect lifelike visuals for both all-time classics and latest releases, plus clearer audio and better dialogue.</p>
<p>Speaking of content, you’ll never be out of stuff to watch. The cube lets you stream more than 1.8 million movies and TV episodes, including favorites from Netflix, Prime Video, Disney+, Peacock, and more. You can even use it as a speaker by listening to music on Spotify and other similar apps. Smart search capabilities with voice control take the experience even further. You can use your voice to command Alexa, plus find movies by actor, plot, and even iconic quotes. For instance, if you’re feeling like watching a good crime thriller, just say something like, “Alexa, show me the latest thrillers with a major plot twist”. Want to relax with a lighthearted comedy show? Try saying “Alexa, show me the best comedy TV shows of all times”, and the job will be done within seconds without you having to press any buttons or get up from the couch.</p>



<p>Alexa compatibility also lets you control your TV, soundbar, and other smart devices around the house easily. You can hop on video calls, check your schedule, and get a live view of your security camera in no time. Getting started with using the Fire TV Cube couldn’t be easier. All you need to do is connect the cube to your TV’s HDMI port and then the home internet. Make sure it’s placed at least one to two feet away from the speakers for ideal functionality. Once it’s connected to the internet, follow the instructions on your TV screen to complete the process.</p>
<p>You’ll also appreciate how the device takes privacy seriously with privacy protections and controls built right in. There’s an off button on the cube that lets you disconnect the microphones when it’s not in use, for added peace of mind.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4111/">Note that Amazon is also offering a free upgrade to its smartest AI assistant – the Alexa+ – with this offer.</a> The early access is expected to last through the end of January, so there’s still time to try it out without paying anything extra.</p>
