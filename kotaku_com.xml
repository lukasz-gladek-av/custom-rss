              <p>Pokémon Poke-nade Monster Ball may sound like the world’s weirdest energy drink crossover, but it is in fact the translated name for Pokémon’s latest venture, a Tamagotchi-style interactive keychain pet, albeit far more complex than the Tamagotchis of old. Which of course raises two all-important questions: Can you let the Pokémon starve to death? And will it poop?</p> <p>This&nbsp;<em>isn’t</em> a Pokémon x Tamagotchi situation, it should be said. That has happened before, as a matter of fact: an official crossover with Bandai Namco’s pocket toys happened in 2019, with the retro devices selling out day one on the Pokémon Center. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S1p92K06svQ">YouTuber UnlistedLeaf</a> once found himself trapped caring for a teeny pixel Eevee that incessantly demanded food, but instead of pooping would cough up furballs. And no, that one didn’t die if you failed to look after it, but instead ran away. Which is kind of horrifying in its own right.</p>  <p>This new venture (<a href="https://essential-japan.com/news/pokemon-is-getting-its-own-official-tamagotchi-style-virtual-pet/">spotted by <em>Essential Japan</em></a>), which is with Bandai rival Takara Tomy looks like a much more advanced toy. First of all, it’s in color, but also encased in a Poké ball shell, with a touch-sensitive screen. The latter is because a part of looking after your pocket-sized pocket monster is stroking it (that’s the “Poke-nade” part of the name, which is a portmanteau of Pokémon and “naderu,” to stroke).</p>

 <p>Apparently, poking at the screen will get the Pokémon to react in various cutesy ways. According to&nbsp;<em>Essential Japan</em>, “the Pokémon will react differently depending on the length and speed of the petting,” and you are fully able to make your own revolting jokes right here.</p> <p>The Monster Ball sounds pretty impressively in-depth compared to the Tamagotchi, which could only eat, sick up fur, and eventually evolve. This new toy will let you play with the Pokémon, and even take part in Pokémon battles. There’s also a diary feature that’ll remember all your previous interactions, and the device will apparently offer 157 different Pokémon to choose from. Some of them—Pikachu, Eevee, Sprigatito, Fuecoco, Quaxly, Lucario and Sylveon—will even be voiced and come with more detailed animations.</p>

 <figure id="attachment_2000623448" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000623448"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000623448">© The Pokémon Company</figcaption></figure> <p>That inclusion of Sylveon on the list does suggest one peculiar aspect, however. If you can start with an Eevee or a Sylveon, it does indicate that the monsters might not be able to evolve. An odd choice if true, especially given the Paldean starter Pokémon included get far more entertaining as they grow.</p> <p>It looks like these will be a Japan-only release for now, but despite featuring a touch screen and far more complexity than a Tamagotchi, they’re surprisingly cheap. ¥7,480, which works out to just over $50. However, I’m absolutely certain they’ll sell out almost instantly, and go for far higher resale prices to the rest of the world.</p> <p>But can they die?! Do they poop?! We <em>don’t know</em>. It seems incredibly unlikely, given The Pokémon Company overrode the usual rules for Tamagotchi when it partnered with them, but it’ll be interesting to learn how the game responds to a bad owner. Or a messy one.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>The new video game movie gold rush is finally <a href="https://kotaku.com/call-of-duty-skins-black-ops-7-blops-6-carry-over-battlefield-6-2000620379">seeing <em>Call of Duty</em></a> get adapted for the big screen, but we still don’t know who is writing or directing the military shooter’s Hollywood debut. <a href="https://puck.news/newsletter_content/what-im-hearing-spielbergs-call-of-duty-pitch-phil-suns-exit-the-rock-rebrand-a-rotten-reckoning/#selection-2355.0-2381.131">According to <em>Puck News</em></a>, Steven Spielberg was lobbying for the job but Activision turned him down. The three-time Oscar winner wanted full creative control that the publisher reportedly just wasn’t willing to give. <em>Call of Duty</em> fans are in shock.</p> <p>“This has got to be one of the biggest fumble in video game movie history,” reads one of the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/CallOfDuty/comments/1n8y5l2/cod_this_has_got_to_be_one_of_the_biggest_fumble/">top threads</a> on the <em>Call of Duty</em> subreddit this morning. “Imagine turning down the guy who made <em>Saving Private Ryan</em> to go with the studio responsible for the <em>Halo</em> show,” wrote another.</p> <p>Multiple movie studios were pitching Activision on handling the film adaptation of the top-grossing annual franchise, including Universal whose package included Spielberg as the director. According to <em>Puck News</em>, the publisher, now owned by Microsoft, balked at the “Spielberg Deal” which would have given the <em>Schindler’s List </em>director “top-of-market economics, final cut, and full control over production and marketing.” So Activision <a href="https://kotaku.com/call-of-duty-movie-paramount-activision-2000622362">ultimately went with Paramount instead</a>, which released the slick, feel-good military thriller <em>Top Gun: Maverick</em> in 2022.</p>

 <p>As fans have pointed out, there’s an incredible irony in a series like <em>Call of Duty</em> passing on a collaboration with Spielberg. The original <em>Call of Duty</em> was a direct response to the <em>Medal of Honor</em> series, which Spielberg produced the first three games for. Activision than hired away the guys who made <em>Medal of Honor: Allied Assault</em> to form Infinity Ward and make its own WWII shooter. Moments from <em>Saving Private Ryan</em> like the Normandy landing scene helped inform the DNA for what a classic <em>Call of Duty</em> action set-piece even is. And then, nearly 25 years later, Activision turned around and said, “no, thank you”?</p> <p>Video game movie adaptations are fraught enough as it is without turning down someone you can rely on to at least have a clear and cohesive vision for what it’s going to be on top of being one of the safest bets in Hollywood. Paramount may be able to deliver a silver screen windfall for Activision regardless, and I’m sure there’s no shortage of high-profile directors who will share creative control with the publisher for enough dollar signs in their contract. But some <em>Call of Duty</em> fans will probably never forgive the company for not taking a risk on what could have been.</p>
