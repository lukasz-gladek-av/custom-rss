I’m literally a different person in four years, so it’s like my whole feelings about everything have changed—my aesthetic sensibilities have evolved,” said Barone. </p><p>While people wait for<em> Haunted Chocolatier</em>, they can play <em>Stardew Valley </em>on basically every platform under the sun, including consoles, mobile devices, and PC. </p><p> .<br></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
