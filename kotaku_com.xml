            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><span>Days after hiking up the prices to transmogrify your armor in </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/games/world-of-warcraft"><i><span>World of Warcraft</span></i></a><span>, developer Blizzard announced it’s reducing them in half—a decision that came after overwhelming player outrage.</span></p> <p><span>The transmog fiasco started with the launch of the pre-expansion patch for </span><i><span>World of Warcraft: Midnight</span></i><span> on January 20. The patch introduced a plethora of updates to a number of the game’s systems, and the transmog system, which allows players to change the appearance of armor pieces for previously acquired gear without affecting their stats, was one of them. The transmog overhaul ushered in two big problems for the community: the new system is convoluted, and to make matters worse, it’s incredibly expensive. Or used to be, anyway, as Blizzard has already announced it’s dialing the inflation rate back.</span></p> <p><span>“We’re going to lower the cost of outfit creation prices by 50% to bring them more in line with what the prices were prior to the Transmog update,” community manager Linxy </span><a href="https://us.forums.blizzard.com/en/wow/t/free-transmog-change-coming-for-all-characters/2233128/696"><span>wrote on the Blizzard forums</span></a><span> yesterday. “This price reduction is currently under development and should be available within the next day.”</span></p>

 <p><span>The change makes sense, as the new system has characters starting with just two outfit slots for their transmog creations. You can unlock more, of course, but initial prices started at 100 gold and ramped up to almost 800,000 gold to unlock all 20 slots on a given character. So, if you’re somebody who juggles five characters at once and you like to engage with the in-game fashion, having 20 slots for all five of them would cost almost 4 million gold. And this is all without considering the costs of changing the individual pieces in said outfits.</span></p> <p><span>Now, all of these prices are being halved. In addition, Linxy said the team is “going to try” to grant one free transmog to all player-characters soon, before patch 12.0.1. This should “hopefully” happen via a hotfix.</span></p>

 <p><span>The free transmog is also part of the response to community complaints. When Blizzard released the pre-expansion patch, all transmogs that were previously applied to gear were removed. As </span><a href="https://us.forums.blizzard.com/en/wow/t/free-transmog-change-coming-for-all-characters/2233128"><span>explained</span></a><span> by community manager Kaivax on the forums, this was intentional to reflect the transition from a gear-based to a slot-based system. All previously saved loadouts are still present, converted to Custom Sets as part of the new system. The problem, however, is that it costs the normal amount of gold to apply the first transmog to your character, even if you only want to set your appearance back to the way it was before. Kaivax called this “an oversight” on the developers’ part, as players should be able to maintain or reset their existing look without cost.</span></p>

 <p><span>“With the 12.0.1 update before the launch of </span><i><span>Midnight</span></i><span>, all player-characters will be granted one free Transmog,” continues the response. “This will be automatically applied to the next outfit created for each character. We apologize for any inconvenience caused by first-time Transmog costs.”</span></p> <h2><b>Pricing isn’t the only problem with the new transmog system</b></h2> <p><span>While the pricing reduction is a welcoming change, it hardly addresses the only qualm that </span><i><span>World of Warcraft</span></i><span> players have with the new transmog system. The community is also complaining about the convoluted UX, as it used to be simpler in the old system, as well as the multiple added steps the latest changes require.</span></p>

 <p><span>“I think I’ve spent about half of my gametime playing dress up since transmog has been released as a feature,” reads a </span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/wow/comments/1qj7opk/not_to_be_dramatic_but_im_quitting_over_the_new/"><span>Reddit thread</span></a><span> from a </span><i><span>World of Warcraft </span></i><span>player who says they’re quitting the game. “Now (…) trying to set up anything just fills me with apathy. Why was the icon selection and naming of sets downgraded for the ‘main’ transmog screen? The outdated all-in-one icon selection from classic, without search or prioritizing your outfit’s items is MASSIVELY more annoying than the previous transmog system’s auto-select that just went with the first item’s icon of your outfit. Also, 16 characters limit for outfit names is nonsense.”</span></p> <figure id="attachment_2000662666" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000662666"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000662666">©Blizzard Entertainment</figcaption></figure> <p><span>This account is far from the only one voicing such complaints. In the replies to an </span><a href="https://www.wowhead.com/guide/transmogrification/everything-about-transmog-ui-appearances"><span>explainer</span></a><span> by </span><i><span>World of Warcraft</span></i><span> enthusiast site </span><i><span>Wowhead</span></i><span>, people have posted multiple questions about the minutiae of the system. “I just opened up WoW and ALL my warriors look ridiculous,” reads one of the comments. “All the gear I’ve put on them over the years is gone and they look like noobs. I have lost over 2K gold trying to figure out the new transmog bs and when I check them out, they’re still in the wrong stuff. I’ve saved, I’ve bought a slot. I’ve only played WoW since it’s inception so yes, I’m older than most but this is ridiculous and it’s enough to make me want to quit the game.”</span></p> <p><span>Those on roleplaying servers are particularly impacted by these issues, as for many of them, transmogrification is particularly important to defining character identity, as well as adding to the immersion of certain events and actions. Say, for example, that your character is wearing a hood or a helmet, and you want to switch out to a scarf when entering a house. In the old system, you could open your inventory bags and select another transmogged item, switching it on the fly. Now, that individual item transmogging is no longer possible.</span></p>

 <p><span>As </span><a href="https://us.forums.blizzard.com/en/wow/t/transmog-loss-of-an-important-feature-for-roleplayers/2202216"><span>explained by a veteran roleplayer</span></a><span> in the forums, people in these servers are prone to keep flavor items in their possession, such as cloaks to change depending on the weather environment, or a set of white gloves when a character needs to provide medical care for someone.</span></p> <p><span>The use cases are many, but unfortunately, the latest changes to transmogrification have introduced limitations. Instead of selecting an item from your inventory, you would have to pay gold to make a change to your current outfit, only to pay again once you revert it later. Plus, these actions take time, which can interrupt the flow of immersion during active scenes.</span></p>

 <p><span>“I am not a coder, I have no idea how difficult it would be to implement a system where certain items are exempt from the outfit that your character is currently wearing, but I implore you Blizzard, please find a way to allow us to make changes to individual outfit slots on the fly without having to engage with the transmog interface and shell out gold every time,” concludes the post from the roleplayer.</span></p> <p><i><span>World of Warcraft: Midnight</span></i><span> is releasing on March 2. Whether Blizzard decides to roll out more changes based on community feedback remains to be seen.</span></p>

            <guid>1414609</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>40+ days after it was first revealed as the <a href="https://kotaku.com/game-awards-trailers-recap-highguard-titanfall-apex-2000653088">“last big thing” at The Game Awards in December,</a> <em>Highguard’s</em> social media account finally posted again, breaking a long radio silence and leading to a lot of reactions from gamers online.</p> <p>On January 23, the official <em>Highguard</em> Twitter account announced a “Launch Showcase” live stream happening on the game’s release date of January 26. This is the first time the account has posted anything since <a href="https://x.com/PlayHighguard/status/1999629482123231329">replying to someone’s reaction</a> to the initial reveal trailer back on December 12.</p>

 <p>“Tune in on Monday, January 26, at 10am PT for the <em>Highguard</em> Launch Showcase,” posted the <em>Highguard</em> account. “Here, we’ll share an in-depth look at <em>Highguard</em> direct from the studio, featuring a full gameplay deep dive, year one plans, and much more.”</p> <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">Tune in on Monday, January 26, at 10am PT for the Highguard Launch Showcase⚔️</p> <p>Here, we'll share an in-depth look at Highguard direct from the studio, featuring a full gameplay deep dive, year one plans, and much more.</p> <p>👉<a href="https://t.co/zm4I62mMpI">https://t.co/zm4I62mMpI</a> <a href="https://t.co/VlQ4qbCNA3">pic.twitter.com/VlQ4qbCNA3</a></p> <p>— Highguard | Launching Jan 26 2026 (@PlayHighguard) <a href="https://twitter.com/PlayHighguard/status/2014760310046085443?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 23, 2026</a></p></blockquote>  <h2>What’s going on with <em>Highguard</em>?</h2> <p>Since its reveal in December, <em>Highguard</em> has had a strange few weeks. Being the big reveal at the end of the <a href="https://kotaku.com/everything-we-saw-at-the-2025-game-awards-2000652719">Game Awards</a>, which reportedly the company didn’t pay for, got it a lot of eyeballs, but also a lot of scrutiny. People tend to expect some big new sequel or long-awaited project to cap off host Geoff Keighley’s annual award and trailer showcase. Instead, Geoff showcased a free-to-play online shooter that, to many online, looked too similar to many other games already out there. That initial trailer didn’t do a great job explaining what it is, and by and large, people weren’t excited.</p>

 <p>Since then, the people behind <em>Highguard</em> have been radio silent, which has led to more discourse around its radio silence and discussion over what little we’ve seen so far. So this new tweet from the main account caught a lot of people’s attention.</p>

 <p>“Bro finally remembered the password,” posted popular <em>Fortnite</em> leaker Shiina.</p> <p>“I logged in specifically just to mute you,” said another user on Twitter.</p> <p>“Oh my word, they are alive,” posted someone else.</p> <p>“Dead game,” tweeted another user, because of course, at least one person had to shout this overused insult.</p>

 <p>To be clear, there are some positive replies, too. People are excited to see what the game actually is, or people are just happy the devs aren’t giving up on it. Regardless of sentiment, <em>Highguard</em> clearly has the attention of a lot of people online, even if some of them are rooting for it to fail while others are just curious as to how this all ends. We won’t have to wait long to see more as <em>Highguard’s</em> big launch day stream kicks off on January 26. Meanwhile, the game launches that day on consoles and PC. I suspect a lot of eyeballs will once again be watching.</p>

              <p>Anbernic, <a href="https://kotaku.com/anbernic-rg-34xx-retro-handheld-emulation-tariff-1851777125">a hardware company primarily known for its retro gaming handhelds</a>, is hopping into the world of high-end gamepads with a strange, but oddly intriguing, controller that contains a heartbeat sensor.</p> <p><a href="https://gizmodo.com/anbernics-new-controller-has-a-screen-and-built-in-heartbeat-sensor-for-some-reason-2000713347">As spotted by our sister site <em>Gizmodo</em></a>, the Anbernic RG GO1 is a newly announced wireless controller designed to work with PC, mobile phones, and the Nintendo Switch. And it’s an odd duck. The RG GO1, which doesn’t have a price or specific release date yet, features a 2.5-inch IPS LCD screen in the center of the controller. This can be used for various tasks, including reprogramming buttons and turning on rapid fire settings. The just-revealed controller also includes heartbeat sensors in the grips. Why? Anbernic says it will let you “monitor your well-being during intense sessions.” Sure!</p>  <p>Other features included are back buttons, six-axis gyro control, rumble motors for vibration, dual-mode triggers, Bluetooth support, and Purple Kirin’s electro-inductive capacitive joysticks, which the company claims will provide “silky-smooth movement.” Plus, the RG GO1’s face is clear plastic, letting you see some of the innards of the controller, and I’m a sucker for that.</p>

 <p>The RG GO1 is “coming soon.” We don’t have a price, but it will likely be more expensive than the company’s other controller, the $18 RG P01. But can you put a price on weird and cool? I’m being told, yes. Yes, you can.</p>

              <p><i><span>Dead Space </span></i><span>was revealed to be</span><a href="https://gamingbolt.com/dead-space-franchise-is-on-ice-ea-has-zero-plans-for-a-revival-rumor"> <span>permanently on ice</span></a><span> last year. We haven’t seen a non-VR version of the </span><i><span>Thief </span></i><span>franchise since 2014. </span><i><span>Deus Ex</span></i><span> has lain dormant for a decade. </span><i><span>Titanfall 2</span></i><span> also came out ten years ago. There hasn’t been a new 3D </span><i><span>Prince of Persia </span></i><span>for 16 years, and with</span><a href="https://kotaku.com/ubisoft-cancels-long-delayed-prince-of-persia-remake-black-flag-remake-delay-2000661866"> <span>this week’s news</span></a><span> it’s looking unlikely to return. So many massive, deeply loved gaming franchises are routinely being shelved by companies too afraid to gamble the nine-figure sums publishers believe is necessary for success. Yet there’s such an obvious solution!&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>Every time I read a headline about a game franchise being shelved because it’s become too expensive, too big of a risk for a publisher to gamble $200 million on, I want to scream into the sky at the obviousness of the solution. But now, following the 2025 success of games like </span><i><span>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</span></i><span>, </span><i><span>Arc Raiders</span></i><span>, </span><i><span>Lies of P</span></i><span>, and </span><i><span>Helldivers 2</span></i><span>, surely the answer is clear to everyone? License these once big-name franchises to proven mid-size AA teams, and don’t interfere.</span></p>

 <p><span>In the wake of</span><a href="https://kotaku.com/ubisoft-earnings-layoffs-delays-canceled-ai-2000661869"> <span>Ubisoft’s latest</span></a> <a href="https://kotaku.com/ubisoft-share-price-crash-prince-of-persia-ai-2000662169"><span>disastrous</span></a><span> plan to rearrange itself by cancelling multiple projects, and the seemingly constant drip of major publishers shelving major franchises, all while giant company buys giant company for imaginary money, the industry has clearly got itself into a very bad place. Right now, during this grotesque phase of consolidation, with multi-billion-dollar sales seeing publishers consume one another, a financial black hole is being formed.</span></p> <p><span>With the colossally over-inflated prices involved in these deals, those buying are either borrowing heavily from predatory investors or gambling huge stakes of their own fortunes, such that the sheer notion of creating a new game in a once-loved series (let alone an original IP) becomes fantastically risky. To match the ridiculous valuations, the games these companies make are burdened with a need for justification, and every project must be predicted to bring in at least half a billion bucks to be worth even storyboarding. Ubisoft has just declared that it intends the games it makes to annually bring in a billion dollars each! Development costs therefore become self-destructively high, with expectations of figures of at least $200 million being spent to create something with enough spectacle to dazzle a hypothetical mainstream audience. Everything now needs to be the next </span><i><span>Call of Duty</span></i><span> at a time</span><a href="https://kotaku.com/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-sales-activision-2000652111"> <span>when even </span><i><span>Call of Duty</span></i><span> can’t manage that</span></a><span>.</span></p>

 <p><span>Sure, welcome to capitalism 101: It doesn’t work. The need to always grow bigger, for share values to always increase, is a model so unsustainable that a pre-schooler could explain why. But here’s the thing, also easily grasped by toddlers: a moderately successful game that costs around $50 million to develop will make an awful lot more money than no game at all.</span></p>

 <h2><b><i>Dead Space</i></b><b> Needn’t Be Dead</b></h2> <p><span>The most recent example of a beloved game series being shelved is </span><i><span>Dead Space</span></i><span>. In late 2025,</span><a href="https://gamingbolt.com/dead-space-franchise-is-on-ice-ea-has-zero-plans-for-a-revival-rumor"><span> following rumors some months before that </span></a><a href="https://kotaku.com/dead-space-2-remake-canceled-sales-motive-battlefield-1851400721"><span>a </span><i><span>Dead Space 2 </span></i><span>remake had been cancelled</span></a> <span>after the supposedly disappointing sales for 2023’s remake of the original game, </span><a href="https://gamingbolt.com/dead-space-franchise-is-on-ice-ea-has-zero-plans-for-a-revival-rumor"><span>word went around</span></a><span> that EA had put the franchise “on ice.” In December 2024 we’d also learned that </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/dead-space-4-ea-remake-horror-1851727387"><span>the series’ original creators had tried to pitch a </span><i><span>Dead Space 4</span></i><span> to EA</span></a><span>, but had been immediately rejected. One of those original creators, Glen Schofield, still didn’t give up,</span><a href="https://kotaku.com/dead-space-creator-sees-chance-make-dead-space-4-ea-saudi-deal-2000636125"> <span>maintaining in October last year that he was attempting to buy the IP back from EA</span></a><span> in the wake of</span><a href="https://kotaku.com/ea-sale-saudi-arabia-madden-pif-jared-kushner-2000629829"> <span>the company’s attempted sale to Saudi Arabia</span></a><span>, but by December 2025</span><a href="https://gamingbolt.com/dead-space-franchise-is-on-ice-ea-has-zero-plans-for-a-revival-rumor"> <span>this looked incredibly unlikely</span></a><span>. Which is crazy! Because a new </span><i><span>Dead Space </span></i><span>is not something EA needs to be the least bit afraid of.</span></p> <p><span>The original </span><i><span>Dead Space</span></i><span>, released in 2008,</span><a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2017/10/18/ex-visceral-dev-reveals-dead-space-2-cost-60-million-and-underperformed-on-4-million-sales/"> <span>cost approximately $37 million to make</span></a><span>. Adjusted for inflation, that’s $55 million in 2026 money.</span><span> And that was an in-house Electronic Arts studio, spending EA money within EA’s ludicrous corporate structure. I truly believe, with my whole lovely heart, that a well-established AA team would be easily capable of making a game of the caliber of that first, excellent horror-shooter for even less money than that, especially if innovative and novel ideas are used in place of the very fanciest modern graphics.</span></p>

 <figure id="attachment_2000662618" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000662618"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000662618">© Ubisoft</figcaption></figure> <p><span>Here’s another thing my heart believes: That </span><i><span>Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time</span></i><span> remake that Ubisoft</span><a href="https://kotaku.com/prince-of-persia-sands-of-time-remake-ubisoft-leak-2000647174"> <span>was unable to make for six agonizing years</span></a><span> before eventually</span><a href="https://kotaku.com/ubisoft-cancels-long-delayed-prince-of-persia-remake-black-flag-remake-delay-2000661866"> <span>killing it entirely</span></a><span>, could have been turned around by any number of excellent smaller teams. I’m not suggesting for a moment it would be </span><i><span>easy</span></i><span> to do so—it would be fantastically hard, just like making any other top-quality game—but it would be eminently achievable. Not least because, not being made internally at Ubisoft, it wouldn’t have Ubisoft constantly getting in the way. By all reports, </span><i><span>Sands of Time</span></i><span>‘s remake went through multiple iterations, scrapped and started over at least twice, and eventually was the victim of so much feature-creep that it was adding all-new powers, making Farah an entirely different character (for the better, I should add, but in the most complex way), and adding all-new content.</span></p> <p><span>However, in the hands of a super-capable and proven AA team with a proclivity for the genre and a love of the original, it could have been a far more straightforward process. That 2003 original doesn’t need new powers, nor new levels, because it was </span><i><span>fantastically good</span></i><span>. It’s one of the best third-person action games ever made, and featured a time-manipulation gimmick that should have become industry standard. At 23 years old, the original is still a great game, but a clunky and dated one that would benefit so wonderfully from a modern refresh. And that’s all anyone had ever been hoping for from Ubisoft.</span></p> <p><span>I’m sure there are many throwing up their arms and claiming that I’m over-simplifying things here. And yes, I’m being perfunctory, but I’d argue that’s because this is all relative. You might be surprised to learn just how needlessly complicated Ubisoft has made making games, even as far back as the 2000s. . I remember visiting Ubisoft Montreal for the announcement of </span><i><span>Splinter Cell: Double Agent</span></i><span> in 2005, and sitting in their offices as executives explained that development of the game was taking place 24 hours a day by being spread across at least three international studios. When Montreal finished work, they tagged in Ubisoft Milan, who would then pass the baton to Ubisoft Shanghai, and then back to Montreal. There were multiple daily video calls (2005 video calls at that) to try to manage this. Throughout the creation of the game it was </span><i><span>also</span></i><span> worked on by Ubisoft Toronto, Paris-based Gameloft, and North Carolina’s Red Storm. Imagine working like that. Try to imagine a more chaotic way to develop a game. (I remember asking developers how it could possibly work, and the rather taut smiles as they explained that it “wasn’t easy.”)</span></p>

 <figure id="attachment_2000662616" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000662616"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000662616">© Ubisoft</figcaption></figure> <h2><b>Something &gt; Nothing</b></h2> <p><span>So no, a AA team making a $50 million (or even a $5 million) game won’t deliver the spectacle and mainstream breakthrough appeal of </span><i><span>Battlefield</span></i><span>, but nor does it need to. If you’re spending $400m on a game (before you even factor in the cost of a global promotional campaign and wildly expensive influencer events), you need it to be bringing in numbers as close to a billion dollars as possible. If that’s not at all realistic, then the project can’t get greenlit in the first place. But if you’ve spent $50m, and justifiably charge $60 for a top-quality product, you are in the black with so many fewer sales. If your game hits (and let’s remember, we’re in this mess because of all the $200m+ gambles that have missed), you could be in for vast profits.</span></p> <p><span>And it’s not fantasy figures, either! </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/arc-raiders-trigger-nade-kettle-pvp-nerfs-2000659269"><i><span>Arc Raiders</span></i><span> announced this month that it has sold 12 million copies</span></a><span>, which at $40 a pop amounts to $480,000,000. Yup. Half a billion bucks. Sure, minus store fees that’s “only” $336 million. We don’t know its development costs, but developers have stated it was nowhere near AAA budgets. And this is a game with optional in-game cosmetic purchases, meaning that figure is going to be </span><i><span>so</span></i><span> much higher.</span></p>

 <p><i><span>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</span></i><span>’s developers </span><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/12/11/arts/clair-obscur-expedition-33-sandfall.html"><span>claim</span></a><span> it cost less than $10 million to make, and it had sold over 6 million copies by the end of 2025. That means the $50 game has brought in at least $300,000,000 before store tithes. That’s a 3000 percent profit, and these are the numbers from </span><a href="https://thisweekinvideogames.com/news/clair-obscur-expedition-33-sees-sales-spike-following-game-awards-success/"><i><span>before</span></i></a><span> the game won all the 2025 GOTY awards and the sales that will have resulted from that.</span></p> <p><span>These are certainly stand-out examples from last year (although only some of them), but these are figures Ubisoft or EA would sell their grandchildren’s souls to see. The point is, I’m not talking out of my hat here about the potential of spending far less on a far smaller team.</span></p> <figure id="attachment_2000662617" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000662617"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000662617">© EA</figcaption></figure> <p><span>Many AA teams wouldn’t be interested in making a licensed game using someone else’s IP, and honestly, I wouldn’t want to trust a big-name publisher right now even if I were one who did. But many would! If you’re a small team with a $10 million project that didn’t catch fire, you’re in a very difficult place no matter how incredibly talented you might be. Many, many mid-size studios fold at that point, but what if there was the route of being trusted with the next </span><i><span>Dead Space</span></i><span>, or </span><i><span>Legacy of Kain</span></i><span>, or </span><i><span>Sleeping Dogs</span></i><span>, or </span><i><span>Thief</span></i><span>, or </span><i><span>Trespasser</span></i><span>, or </span><i><span>Command &amp; Conquer</span></i><span>, or </span><i><span>Titanfall</span></i><span>, or </span><i><span>Splinter Cell</span></i><span>, or </span><i><span>SSX</span></i><span>, or </span><i><span>Red Faction</span></i><span>, or…</span></p>

 <p><span>Maybe there’s some big, fatal flaw with this concept that would come to the surface on trying. But I’m really doubtful. The issue is the complete lack of ever trying! And honestly, in their crumbling, fire-sale-driven state, what does an Ubisoft or an EA have to lose?! There hasn’t been a </span><i><span>Splinter Cell</span></i><span> game since 2013, meaning for the last 13 years precisely $0 has been made on new </span><i><span>Splinter Cell </span></i><span>games. I realize that’s perhaps somewhat obvious, but it’s a really rather important point! A $10,000,000 </span><i><span>Splinter Cell</span></i><span> that “only” sells a million copies at $50 a pop: that’s a 500 percent profit. And even if it might seem like small change in a world where (very, very few) games bring in a billion dollars, it’s a heck of a lot more than $0.</span></p>
