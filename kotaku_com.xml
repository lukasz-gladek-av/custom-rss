The show doesn’t directly follow the plot of the novels, but does reunite the cast of the 2010 live-action adaptation to voice their movie characters in the series. <em>Kotaku</em>’s Kenneth Shepard called it a  “<span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/scott-pilgrim-takes-off-netflix-ramona-backlash-1851043407&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/scott-pilgrim-takes-off-netflix-ramona-backlash-1851043407">hilarious blend of the [franchise’s] quick wit and well-measured pop culture references</a></span>.” But sadly, the series won’t be getting a second season. </p><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://x.com/bryanleeomalley/status/1859334007319822535&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://x.com/bryanleeomalley/status/1859334007319822535" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">On November 20</a></span>, to mark the one-year anniversary of the premiere of <em>Scott Pilgrim Takes Off</em>, series creator O’Malley tweeted that it was “an honor to work with all of the cast &amp; staff around the world”  and called the series “a one of a kind miracle.” The creator also confirmed that Netflix had recently passed on a second season of the animated adaption. </p><p>“Anyway, we were recently informed that the show will not return,” <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://x.com/bryanleeomalley/status/1859336990405296142&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://x.com/bryanleeomalley/status/1859336990405296142" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">said O’Malley</a></span>. “As you know, we only intended one season, and called in a lot of favors to make it happen, so making more would have been nearly impossible. Still, I know some of you have been holding out hope.” </p><p>“Sorry to all Matthew fans and Gideon fans, I know you will suffer the most,” <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://x.com/bryanleeomalley/status/1859337323307262361&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://x.com/bryanleeomalley/status/1859337323307262361" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">added O’Malley in a follow-up</a></span> to the tweet confirming the news that there would be no second season. </p><p>While some fans were upset with the Netflix show and how much it deviated from the original graphic novels, many others were happy to get a new story featuring these characters. For now, it seems that’s the end of this chapter of the franchise, despite a post-credits scene included in the final episode of <em>Scott Pilgrim Takes Off. </em></p><p><em>&nbsp;.</em><br></p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

While no one associated with the episode explicitly tells us what happens that makes it so bloody, the descriptions we have gotten may be enough to give us a hint. Executive producer Dave Wilson says, “Pac-Man is Joe Pesci and the swordsman is Guy Pearce in <em>Memento.” </em>Seeing how Pesci almost exclusively plays homicidal hotheads, and Guy Pearce strangles a man to death in <em>Memento</em>, the 10-minute <em>Pac-Man</em> episode may just live up to its bloody hype if that comparison holds true. </p><p>As surprised as you may feel about a violent <em>Pac-Man</em> story, the people behind it point out how the original game isn’t all that innocent. JT Petty, teleplay writer of the <em>Pac-Man</em> episode, describes the game as essentially “eating pills in a labyrinth while you’re being chased by ghosts,” in a world where the ghosts’ eyes return to the center of the game to regenerate and repeat the destructive cycle. </p><p>When you look at <em>Pac-Man</em> that way, you can see how there could be a darker side to it; a darker side we’ll have our still-attached-to-our-heads eyes glued to when the episode releases in December.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
