            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/dispatch-review-adhoc-studios-all-8-episodes-finale-2000644106"><em>Dispatch</em> is out on Switch 1 and 2</a> as of January 28, but not without some compromises. The original release had the option to censor certain explicit content from the settings menu, but the version on Nintendo platforms will censor content by default with no option to remove it. That seemingly includes brief scenes that show supervillain Toxic’s full appendage.</p> <p>“Different platforms have different content criteria, and submissions are evaluated individually,” developer AdHoc said in a statement to <em>Eurogamer</em> <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dispatch-switch-switch-2-censored-adhoc-comment">prior to release</a>. “We worked with Nintendo to ensure the content within the title met the criteria to release on their platforms, but the core narrative and gameplay experience remains identical to the original release,” the statement continued.</p>

 <p><em>Dispatch</em> is a four-episode interactive game about reformed villains navigating their emotional baggage and personal hang-ups in a superhero call center. The workplace comedy by ex-Telltale developers also includes some adult moments, like the aforementioned Toxic dong as well as romantic scenes and explicit hand gestures. In fact, some fans have spent the last few months <a href="https://kotaku.com/devs-dispatch-telltale-superhero-game-cut-sex-scenes-romance-2000643646">wishing the game was much raunchier</a>.</p> <p>At one point a character’s areola is exposed as she’s fitting into her new costume. It’s a lighthearted throwaway gag poking fun at the genre’s silly wardrobes, and I’m guessing that moment isn’t in the Switch version either. <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2026/01/psa-dispatchs-visual-censorship-settings-cant-be-removed-on-switch#:~:text=AdHoc%20Studios'%20superhero%20narrative%20adventure,playing%20solely%20on%20Nintendo%20systems.">According to<em> NintendoLife</em></a>, a late-game sex scene has been nerfed altogether. The game’s profanity made it through, however, so you can still hear the characters swear if you want.</p>

 <p>It’s unclear what exactly Nintendo’s rules are for this kind of stuff. The <em>Dispatch</em> changes are especially weird because the Switch eShop is not otherwise shy about suggestive content. Anime sex game shovelware <a href="https://ntdeals.net/us-store/tag/sexual-content?platforms=switch">remains impossible to escape</a>. Maybe some games rated ESRB 17+ are just built different.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><span>I’m a Japanese RPG fan first, and a Soulslike fan second. Maybe third? Anyway, despite thoroughly enjoying games like </span><i><span>Dark Souls</span></i><span> and the countless other similar games inspired by it, the Souslike genre isn’t one I’ve always gravitated toward. Imagine my surprise when Bandai Namco decided to combine the anime aesthetics of a JRPG with the demanding gameplay of </span><i><span>Dark Souls</span></i><span>. </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/code-vein-is-the-chillest-dark-souls-clone-1838481190"><i><span>Code Vein</span></i></a><span> was born. Finally something for </span><i><span>me</span></i><span> specifically.</span></p> <p><span>There aren’t many hybrids like this. Most games in the genre still go for a more realistic art style, like that seen in </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/nioh-2-the-kotaku-review-1842270420"><i><span>Nioh</span></i></a><span>, </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/the-surge-2-is-a-bit-of-a-mess-but-i-cant-stop-playing-1838376079"><i><span>The Surge</span></i></a><span>, and </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/lies-of-p-review-pinocchio-soulslike-bloodborne-sekiro-1850857903"><i><span>Lies of P</span></i></a><span>. Last year’s </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/ai-limit-soulslike-how-long-to-beat-short-hard-1851772663"><i><span>AI Limit</span></i></a><span> and, to a lesser extent, the cel-shaded </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/first-berserker-khazan-review-anime-soulslike-rpg-1851771917"><i><span>Khazan: the Last Berserker</span></i></a><span>, remain isolated examples of the hybrid approach. In this context, </span><i><span>Code Vein</span></i><span> stands out.</span></p>

 <p><span>Its sequel, </span><i><span>Code Vein II</span></i><span>, expands on its predecessor by offering more flexible combat options, as well as a new open world to explore. It also oozes classic JRPG tropes about heroes forging bonds and the strength of friendship. Its enticing time-traveling story takes a bit to get going, but its characters are a highlight. Less brutal than its genre contemporaries, </span><i><span>Code Vein II </span></i><span>emerges as a comfy mix between a Soulslike and a JRPG that makes for a satisfying entry point for folks who want to dip their toes into both genres.</span></p> <p><i><span>Code Vein II </span></i><span>is set in a post-apocalyptic future caused by the Resurgence a century before the events of the game. In order to stop the Resurgence, five heroes gave up their lives to seal away this mysterious force. But in the present, those seals are weakening, leading to the sudden emergence of the Luna Rapacis, a moon-like entity hovering in the middle of the city. This has turned human-like vampiric beings called Revenants into monsters called Horrors. And it’s up to you to travel back in time to change the fates of those original five heroes.</span></p>

 <p><span>The here story isn’t cryptic as one might expect from a game in the Soulslike genre. It’s standalone too, so you don’t have to play the first game to understand this one. With your time-traveling partner, Lou, you travel through the open world to search for each of the heroes’ cocoons, where they’ve been slumbering away for the past century. Lou sends you back in time to fight alongside each hero and at the end of their respective arcs, they hand you a sentimental item that you take back to the present to break the cocoon. This then culminates in a big boss fight against the hero themself, which weaves in a satisfying narrative finish to each hero’s storyline. Unlike with games like </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/elden-ring-fromsoftware-review-hidetaka-miyazaki-dark-s-1848694257"><i><span>Elden Ring</span></i></a><span>, I didn’t need to consult an hour-long YouTube lore essay to figure out what the hell was going on.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><span>I also really enjoyed spending time with </span><i><span>Code Vein II</span></i><span>’s characters. Lou starts off as little more than a tool used for her time travel powers. However, as you and she begin changing the heroes’ fates step by step, she begins to wonder if meddling more in the past might ultimately lead to a better future. Tension arises as the towering and voluptuous Lady Dimetescu-like mother figure and group leader Lavinia Voda warns her not to do so, as it could lead to unintended consequences. But by the end of the story, Lou begins to stand up for herself, and it’s exciting to see her come into her own. Many of the heroes and supporting characters go through similar redemption arcs, adding real emotional weight to the story.</span></p> <figure id="attachment_2000663846" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000663846"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000663846">©Bandai Namco</figcaption></figure> <p><span>My favorite character has to be Zenon Gryfgote. At first, he’s depicted as some sort of immoral mad scientist. However, when you meet him, you quickly realize he’s just a goofball wife guy. You can even see it in his elaborate gold-plated costume, which is adorned with representations of his deceased wife. His helmet also looks like something you’d wear to an EDM concert, and his cape is layered with lights that help convey his emotions. Despite his hulking frame, his flashy design makes him relatable, funny, and down to earth. </span><i><span>Code Vein II</span></i><span>’s larger-than-life cast brings vibrancy to a post-apocalyptic world.</span></p>

 <p><i><span>Code Vein II </span></i><span>is noticeably easier than most Soulslike games I’ve played. A large part of that is due to its NPC companion system. Basically, you can bring one character to fight alongside you at all times. Other Soulslike games usually require some sort of consumable to summon an ally, but there’s absolutely no cost here. They’re impervious to all damage, can draw aggro from bosses, and can even deal the killing blow on enemies. When you die, you even get a sort of </span><i><span>Sekiro</span></i><span>-like second wind. </span><i><span>Code Vein II </span></i><span>is practically a Fisher-Price toy compared to a game like </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/nioh-2-the-kotaku-review-1842270420"><i><span>Nioh 2</span></i></a><span>, but that’s what makes it an entry-level and more approachable Soulslike.</span></p> <h2>Easy mode</h2> <p><span>Don’t get too comfortable, though, as you can’t just run away and let your ally handle bosses all by themselves. Bosses usually have an attack or two that easily closes the distance, so you’ll end up having to confront them directly anyway.</span></p> <p><span>Another way the game forces you to engage with bosses is through its Weapon Formae system. In order to use these flashy special attacks, you expend Ichor, which functions like MP in a JRPG. To recover Ichor, you’ll need to execute Drain Attacks via your equipped Jail. These come in the form of a giant claw, bat wings, and even a scorpion tail. They’re slow to start up, but vital if you want to continue inflicting huge damage. So you also have to strategically pick when to restore Ichor, like when a boss is recovering from finishing a powerful attack. You’re in this rhythmic cycle of attacking, draining, and attacking again, and you need to be up in the enemy’s face in order to do so, making </span><i><span>Code Vein 2</span></i><span> a surprisingly aggressive Soulslike.</span></p>

 <p><span>Unfortunately, sometimes the camera is a pain to deal with in the midst of the game’s bigger boss fights. There were many instances in which my back would be against the wall, and the camera would zoom in so close that I couldn’t decipher the boss’s next attack, leading to a death.</span></p> <p><span>During my playthrough, I switched between my one-handed sword and hammer weapons. For the former, my go-to Forma was Phantom Ambush, which was super helpful for boss fights since I would disappear in a puff of smoke for a second, then slash the enemy twice. When timed right, I could avoid incoming attacks completely while being able to immediately strike back. My favorite hammer Forma was Gaia Impact, which activated a huge AOE shockwave when I slammed my weapon to the ground, perfect for crowd control. The Formae system makes the game feel a lot more like a typical action RPG, something like an </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/ys-x-nordics-arpg-review-guide-1851684251"><i><span>Ys</span></i></a><span> game but with Soulslike core mechanics. These attacks added a degree of cinematic flair that’s often missing from Soulslike games.</span></p> <div>           <ul>                           <li>                 <p>Back-of-the-box quote:</p>                 <p>"Dark Souls for weebs."</p>               </li>                                         <li>                 <p>Developer:</p>                 <p>Bandai Namco</p>               </li>                                         <li>                 <p>Type of game: </p>                 <p>Soulslike</p>               </li>                                         <li>                 <p>Liked:</p>                 <p>Charming cast of characters, plenty of customization, fun combat, great boss design.</p>               </li>                               </ul><ul>                                         <li>                 <p>Disliked:</p>                 <p> Performance issues, funky camera, boring normal enemies, repetitive dungeons.</p>               </li>                                         <li>                 <p>Platforms:</p>                 <p>PC, PS5 (played), Xbox Series X|S.</p>               </li>                                         <li>                 <p>Release date: </p>                 <p>January 29, 2026</p>               </li>                                         <li>                 <p>played:</p>                 <p>45 hours. All characters arcs and most sidequests completed. Unlocked all three endings: normal, good, and true. Still have to find all hot springs and healing upgrades in the open world.</p>               </li>                                     </ul>         </div>  <p><span>Central to the game’s customization systems are Blood Codes, which act kind of like character classes that you can equip to fit your playstyle. For example, if you like parrying, Lyle’s Blood Code is ideal since its traits include powering up its parry staggering capabilities. If you’re a more careful player, Holly’s Blood Code might suit you, as it restores some HP upon defeating an enemy. What makes Blood Codes flexible is that even though they have specific traits and boost certain stats, you’re free to use whatever weapons you like the most regardless of which one you have equipped.</span></p>

 <p><span>After mastering a Blood Code, you can extract a Booster from it, which are passive skills that you can equip. For example, mastering Zenon’s Blood Code rewards you with Halberd Mastery, which of course increases your attack strength when wielding Halberds. Between Blood Codes, Formae, and Boosters, there’s a large variety of customization options that make fights feel both extravagant and exhilarating.</span></p> <h2>The open road</h2> <p><span>Like many sequels before it, </span><i><span>Code Vein II</span></i><span> takes the predictable route in becoming an open-world game. The freedom this shift allows reminded me of </span><i><span>Elden Ring</span></i><span> in which, if I was stuck on a boss, I’d explore more, get stronger, and come back to tackle the boss again. This allowed me to still make progress somewhere else even if my attempts to advance in one direction had hit a wall. And that’s pretty much what I did throughout. Interestingly, this freedom meant that I accidentally skipped over what was intended to be the game’s first hero story, Josee’s, in the Sunken City area. Instead, I veered off a little too far into the northeast towards the Corroded Scar region and started Lyle’s first.</span></p> <figure id="attachment_2000663847" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000663847"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000663847">©</figcaption></figure> <p><span>After breaking Lyle’s cocoon, I couldn’t beat his corrupted form to continue the story. So instead, I went back to Josee’s location and finished her story arc. Since I was almost done with Lyle’s arc anyway, I was overpowered for Josee’s, defeating her corrupted form handily. This looser approach of story progression works in the open world’s favor. With side dungeons and mini-bosses to boot, exploration never felt like a waste of time. Every little thing I did made me stronger, which would eventually help me beat the bosses I’d initially had trouble with. Unfortunately, the dungeons grow a bit repetitive, and enemy variety is lacking compared to the extravagantly designed bosses.</span></p>

 <p><span>That said, you get a cool bike to speed exploration up, along with a generous amount of fast-travel points. On the downside, the joys of exploration are marred a bit by performance issues as you speed around the world with foliage constantly popping in and out, at least on PS5 Pro where I played the game.&nbsp; There was also one point at which I made the classic Soulslike runback from a save point to the boss and I skipped so many enemies that when they all started chasing me on the screen, the framerate slowed to a crawl.</span></p> <p><i><span>Code Vein II</span></i><span> doesn’t just take a superficial anime aesthetic and use it as window dressing on a popular genre. Its story and charming cast elevate it to create a unique middle ground that will appeal to JRPG and Soulslike fans alike. It’s got its fair share of issues, such as the performance woes and boring enemy fodder design. Still, if you’re looking to ease into the Soulslike genre before hitting the big leagues, </span><i><span>Code Vein II</span></i><span> is worth spilling blood over.</span></p>

            <title><![CDATA[Scott Pilgrim EX Just Skyrocketed To The Top Of My Winter Game List]]></title>
            <link>https://kotaku.com/scott-pilgrim-ex-release-date-trailer-2000663831</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Scott Pilgrim is taking on the world, again, in March. Capcom leans into Leon’s “hot uncle” makeover. And an old Kickstarter for a tabletop game reveals the worst outcome possible. It’s another edition of Morning Checkpoint, <em>Kotaku</em>‘s daily roundup of gaming news, rumors, and culture. Speaking of fan speculation and rumors, it’s never a good sign when the official franchise account <a href="https://x.com/assassinscreed/status/2016531108486095252">responds to you with a GIF from <em>Grand Theft Auto</em></a>. The <em>Assassin’s Creed IV: Black Flag</em> remake was reportedly delayed, but hopefully the <a href="https://x.com/yosp/status/2016446516236562657">next game from indie standout Red Candle Games</a> is coming along smoothly.</p> <h2><em>Scott Pilgrim EX</em> has a release date and a new trailer</h2>  <p>It’s out March 3 and will include League of Evil Exes’ Matthew Patel and Robot-01 as playable characters. This spiritual successor to the 2010 brawler is a bit more RPG-lite with non-linear quests and exploration, according to the devs at Tribute Games. They recently helped launch <em>Marvel Cosmic Invasion</em>, another excellent retro throwback with some neat tricks. Hopefully the team has put some cool surprises in <em>Scott Pilgrim EX</em> which, with today’s news, is now handily my most anticipated release of the winter.</p>

 <h2><em>Monster Hunter Wilds</em> fixes a bizarre DLC bug recently <a href="https://kotaku.com/monster-hunter-wilds-pc-performance-framerate-dlc-2000660149">unearthed by a modder</a></h2> <p><a href="https://info.monsterhunter.com/wilds/update/en-au/Ver.1.040.03.01.html">The new PC performance patch is out</a> and the notes include the following: “Fixed an issue where system load could increase around the Support Desk at Base Camp or the Grand Hub due to claimed content status checks.” Hopefully it brings the Steam version of the game more in line with the console version and turns things around in a meaningful way heading into the game’s one-year anniversary.</p> <h2><em>RuneScape</em> maker promises no genAI that players can “feel”</h2> <p>“We’ve got a pretty hard line stance with the team, which is a commitment that no generative AI will ever be present in any asset that a player can touch, hear or feel. There will be no generative AI in the game that they experience,” Jagex SVP of product James Dobrowski <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/runescape-maker-jagex-says-it-will-never-use-generative-ai-to-make-in-game-content">told <em>GamesIndustry.biz</em></a>. Tooling efficiency, which seemingly means coding, QA checks, and other process-oriented stuff, is another story.</p>

 <p>“Where we are open to the use of AI is in things like tooling efficiency; how do we make the way we work more efficient in order to make our staff’s lives easier and allow us to produce better content. But we do not want to be using AI to drive creativity,” he said.</p>

 <h2>Capcom talks about Leon’s “hot uncle” makeover</h2> <p>“We’ve spent quite a lot of time polishing Leon’s visuals,” <em>Resident Evil Requiem</em> director Koshi Nakanishi <a href="https://automaton-media.com/en/news/resident-evil-requiems-leon-kennedy-became-a-hot-uncle-thanks-to-hawk-eyed-female-capcom-staff-who-reviewed-even-the-finest-wrinkles-on-his-neck-director/">told <em>Automaton</em></a>. “Leon has many fans among Capcom employees, and women in particular were pretty strict when reviewing his design. They would point out and comment on even the finest details like the wrinkles on his neck. When I mentioned that story in the past, a female fan told me, The women developers at Capcom did a really good job&nbsp;(laughs).”</p> <h2><em>Arc Raiders</em> hit by DDoS attack ahead of next patch</h2> <p>Players who were recently having connection issues now know why. Community lead Julia Ossen told fans on the game’s Discord that the studio has been “under extensive, coordinated DDoS attacks” which the team is addressing. “The strike team has been working hard on mitigations and solutions to fix the problem, and we are making good progress,” she wrote. “But at this point in time the attacks are still ongoing.” The attack happened alongside the game’s new patch which <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ArcRaiders/comments/1qobyp9/here_we_go_slient_nerfs_not_mentioned_in_the/">includes some stealth nerfs</a>.</p>

 <h2>The<em> Darkest Dungeon</em> board game is dead</h2> <p>Over 28,000 backers&nbsp;pledged&nbsp;<span>$5,657,479</span> to help bring this project to life and no more shipments will be going out. “We put our trust in Mythic Games to deliver on their promises and uphold the <em>Darkest Dungeon</em> name,” Red Hook Games <a href="https://www.darkestdungeon.com/news/regarding-mythic-games-and-the-darkest-dungeon-board-game/">announced this week</a>. “We won’t mince words, their collapse and inability to fulfill Wave 2 orders is an enormously disappointing development and we know it deeply affects many <em>Darkest Dungeon</em> fans.” An ex-employee is providing the studio with the source files for all of Mythic’s work so players can make their own versions.</p> <h2>More indies are bailing on Xbox</h2> <p>Xbox versions of the stylish medieval combat game <em>1348 Ex Voto</em> and Nickelodeon’s<em> Splat Pack</em> have both been binned, <a href="https://www.tweaktown.com/news/109896/two-indie-games-have-cancelled-their-xbox-versions/index.html"><em>TweakTown</em> reports</a>. “While we previously announced that the game would be released on Xbox consoles, we have the unfortunate news that this is no longer the case,” the developer behind 1348 Ex Voto <a href="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/G_RrTmoWMAACEkw?format=jpg&amp;name=medium">said this week</a>. “As release approaches for the indie team, priorities are constantly evaluated and sometimes must shift to deliver the best experience possible.”</p> <h2>ICYMI:</h2> <ul> <li><strong><a href="https://kotaku.com/walmart-leak-gamecube-games-switch-online-metroid-pikmin-2000663430">More Switch Online GameCube games leaked</a></strong></li> <li><strong><a href="https://kotaku.com/mining-crystals-in-highguard-is-so-damn-satisfying-ps5-pc-steam-2000663527">Something <em>Highguard</em> gets right: mining crystals</a></strong></li> <li><strong><a href="https://kotaku.com/batman-arkham-parody-perfectly-captures-the-horror-and-absurdity-of-living-in-gotham-2000663597">Living inside <em>Batman: Arkham</em> would be terrifying</a></strong></li> </ul> <h2>Watch this:</h2>

              <p>Digital PC gaming storefront <a href="https://kotaku.com/gog-anti-drm-cd-projekt-witcher-3-cyberpunk-2000659280">Good Old Games</a> is the latest video game-related company to be caught using AI-generated artwork. As you might expect, a lot of people aren’t pleased about this, including an artist who works at GOG.</p> <p><a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2026/01/gog-now-using-ai-generated-images-on-their-store/">As first reported by <em>GamingOnLinux</em></a>, someone on <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/gog/comments/1qoigy5/ai_in_the_storefront/">Reddit spotted</a> what looks like AI-generated artwork being used to advertise an ongoing 2026 sale on GOG. The biggest giveaway that this art was generated using an AI tool or site is that a SNES-like console in the image seems to be melting. <a href="https://www.gog.com/forum/general/5000_gog_patrons_and_an_ai_banner/page1">GOG users actually spotted this AI artwork last week</a> and began posting about it. For many, it was disappointing to see a company that <a href="https://kotaku.com/gog-games-preservation-program-drm-1851696363">claims to care about preservation</a> and creators using AI to create a simple store banner.</p> <p>Likely in response to the hubbub surrounding the AI-generated banner, KosmicznaPluskwa, a GOG forums user who appears to be a graphic artist working at the company, <a href="https://www.gog.com/forum/general/5000_gog_patrons_and_an_ai_banner?staff=yes">posted a lengthy response on the store’s forums on January 26.</a> And while KosmicznaPluskwa made it clear they aren’t a spokesperson for GOG, the artist confirmed that the image people were speculating was machine-created was indeed generated completely using AI tools, something that upset the artist.</p>

 <p>“OK, so to clear the air – current sale banner is fully AI. Not my work,” posted KosmicznaPluskwa. “This is all I can say on this. My team is much smaller now than it used to be, and the requirements for the role are completely different than it used to be.”</p> <p><em>Kotaku</em> contacted GOG about the art, but didn’t hear back before publication.</p> <p>KosmicznaPluskwa continued in their lengthy forum post and discussed how AI art is everywhere now and how it makes them sad to see.</p>

 <p>“It’s just miserable to think about how surrounded and how ever-present it all is now,” said KosmicznaPluskwa.</p> <p>“How will it affect us as the humanity. And no, I don’t think it will destroy art altogether but the omnipresence of it will not not go without its effect on us as a whole. Maybe it doesn’t matter some store put out sloppy work on promo banner – in the end everyone is just there to buy the product – but I know I enjoy seeing cool new artworks out there, when I’m out to buy new products as well. When I buy a new cool figure I like to keep the box around if it’s pretty – this is kind of the same, but on digital level. More cool art to see on top of buying art (video games in our case here) is always more cool art in the world and this is what I’m happy to have. So with everyone also feeling strongly in this thread – I’m with you. And continue speaking up – in the face of future we don’t like to see, complacency is not the way.”</p>
