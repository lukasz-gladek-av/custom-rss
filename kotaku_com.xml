Specifically, many want to know if <em>Tony Hawk’s</em> <em>Underground </em>and <em>Underground 2 </em>will get fancy remakes one day. According to Tony Hawk, he wants those remakes, too, and will “campaign” to make them real. </p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="197562" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="THPS 3+4 Does Away With The OG 4's Career Mode, Here's Why" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="118" data-playlist="197562,195752,195618" data-current="197562"><div><p>THPS 3+4 Does Away With The OG 4's Career Mode, Here's Why</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197562/197562_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197562/197562_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197562/197562_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/23086.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/tony-hawks-pro-skater-3-4-officially-revealed-launchin-1851767654&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/tony-hawks-pro-skater-3-4-officially-revealed-launchin-1851767654"><em>THPS 3+4 </em>is  an upcoming remake</a></span> of the third and fourth entries in the <em>THPS</em> franchise, which were released in 2001 and 2002 respectively on PS2.

The kids love open-world games and zany antics. They’d likely dig <em>THUG</em>.

Serving as a prequel to 2016's <em>Doom</em>, this newest entry in the franchise features a heavy medieval flavor, so you’ll need to master using a shield and flail alongside the usual bevy of deadly guns you’ve come to expect. If you’re diving into the game and want a few tips on how to approach this fresh take on the series, we’ve got you covered below.</p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="196653" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="The Week In Games: A Star Wars Classic Returns &amp; More New Releases" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="105" data-playlist="196653,195371,195386" data-current="196653"><div><p>The Week In Games: A Star Wars Classic Returns &amp; More New Releases</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196653/196653_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196653/196653_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196653/196653_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196653/196653_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/22209.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>1. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;#difficulty&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="#difficulty">Customize the experience</a></span><br>2. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;#explore&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="#explore">Explore your environments (it’s worth it!)</a></span><br>3. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;#defense&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="#defense">Master your shield</a></span><br>4. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;#challenge&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="#challenge">Take on every mission challenge</a></span></p><hr><h2 id="h831668"><a id="difficulty"></a>You can customize your gameplay to suit your preferences</h2><p><em>Doom: The Dark Ages</em> doesn’t gatekeep. While you’re free to tackle the game on a pre-set difficulty, <strong>you can also customize your gameplay experience with a variety of sliders</strong>. These give you control over things like the difficulty and aggression of enemies, how much damage you do to demons, your parry window, and even the overall game speed. <br></p><p><strong>Read More:</strong> <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/new-doom-dark-ages-review-is-it-good-xbox-ps5-game-pass-1851779839&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/new-doom-dark-ages-review-is-it-good-xbox-ps5-game-pass-1851779839"><em>Doom: The Dark Ages: </em>The <em>Kotaku</em> Review</a></span></p><p>And remember: There is no wrong answer here. Gaming is meant to be fun, so adjust these settings to wherever they need to be for you to have a hell of a good time. Besides, if you decide you want to increase or decrease the challenge, you can hop into the menu and change the sliders at any time.</p><h2 id="h831669"><a id="explore"></a>Exploration is more important than ever</h2><p>Exploration has always led to useful things in the <em>Doom </em>franchise, but you’re <em>really</em> going to want to seek out every nook and cranny in <em>Doom: The Dark Ages</em>. <strong>By thoroughly exploring each mission, you’ll uncover vital upgrade materials that are necessary for improving your weapons and abilities</strong>. Without these killer upgrades, you’ll be leaving a lot of damage and utility on the table, so keep a close eye on any icons on your map and hunt those materials down!</p><p>In addition to upgrade materials, you’ll also find plenty of collectibles and skins for your weapons scattered about missions. So if you’re a fan of looking stylish while you mow down Hell’s hordes, then you have even more reasons to chase down every question mark on the map. </p><h2 id="h831670"><a id="defense"></a>Sometimes, the best offense is a good defense</h2><p><em>Doom: The Dark Ages</em> differs from previous <em>Doom </em>titles in that you’ll spend a lot of time parrying with a shield, which deflects damage back at whatever demon thought it was a good idea to mess with you. While this might initially feel a bit at odds with the franchise’s fast-paced first-person shooting, you’ll soon find that parrying flows effortlessly into the rest of your kit to become one of your most useful strategies for making quick work of baddies.</p><p>If you see demons coming at you with a green attack or firing green projectiles your way, that’s your cue to deflect and then lay into them. Once you master this thrilling dance between offense and defense, you’ll finally be the Doom Slayer we always knew you could be.</p><h2 id="h831671"><a id="challenge"></a>Missing mission challenges would be a mistake</h2><p>Early in <em>Doom: The Dark Ages</em>, you’ll be introduced to mission challenges, which provide you with three optional tasks in a level. Completing these tasks earns you rewards like weapon skins or extra gold to be used toward all-important upgrades, so it’s a smart idea to always check them in your menu at the beginning of a level so that you can be sure to work on them as you explore.</p><p>Moreover, mission challenges can sometimes give you vague hints as to where you may find some well-hidden secrets. For instance, one level has a mission challenge that specifically asks you to land at two secret spots while exploring an open-ended area with your dragon. If you didn’t know those existed, you may have been left frustrated about why you could never find the final secrets in the level. Thanks for all you do, mission challenges. We love you.</p><hr><p><em>Doom: The Dark Ages</em> is available now on PS5, Xbox Series X/S, and Windows PCs.  </p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Here’s the full special if you’ve not seen it: </p><p>“Fact: Gaming isn’t just a hobby. It is a lifestyle,” says an unnamed narrator during a short video at the front of the special. It explains video gaming started with <em>Pong</em> and Atari,  some other stuff happened, then the original Xbox launched and don’t worry about that thing called the PlayStation. </p><p>After that, the funniest moment in the entire special happens. Remember, up until this point we didn’t know the console was to be called the Xbox 360. It was just the “Next Gen Xbox.” So young Zack, who watched this MTV special back in 2005, was excited to learn more about the next Xbox. Elijah Wood yells, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://youtu.be/LTs0AoaMYGA?t=166&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://youtu.be/LTs0AoaMYGA?t=166" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">“The future of gaming!” and points off screen</a></span>. The camera cuts to a...woman carrying a gray bag. Can you imagine the online chuds today watching this? Their heads might explode. </p><figure id="" data-id="74bd24e62beb56dfa61ab2411665a669" data-recommend-id="image://74bd24e62beb56dfa61ab2411665a669" data-format="png" data-width="639" data-height="360" data-lightbox="true" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Xbox /hunchbiscuit / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="74bd24e62beb56dfa61ab2411665a669" data-recommend-id="image://74bd24e62beb56dfa61ab2411665a669" data-format="png" data-width="639" data-height="360" data-lightbox="true" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>In reality, the woman is carrying the Xbox 360 in her shoulder bag. She saunters up to a podium and pulls out the console. Sets it up. Hits a button. Green lights turn on. And the console’s name is revealed.</p><p>The rest of special is mostly MTV nonsense, celebrities, and The Killers performing music. The only segment that is actually somewhat interesting happens about 11 minutes into the show: Sway from MTV is invited to talk to the designers behind the Xbox 360 and J Allard (one of the OG Microsoft execs behind the Xbox project.) It’s during this segment that we see a bunch of 360 prototypes and learn about why it looks the way it does. And then Allard walks Sway through the idea of buying digital content on a video game console using the internet. </p><p>Today, this is something every device can do. Back in 2005, this was the future. It was hard for young Zack to believe that one day we’d buy games digitally on a console. 20 years later, it’s clear Microsoft was on to something with Xbox Live, the marketplace, a single username that follows you from game to game, and hanging out online with friends in voice chat. Though, the moment when Allard mentions buying clothes for your digital character, I realized microtransactions were being invented in front of my eyes and got sad. </p><p>At the end of the event, Wood got on stage and signed off by saying: “I think we can all agree on one thing tonight: Xbox 360 is going to be amazing and I look forward to meeting all of you in the Xbox 360 universe.” I never met Elijah Wood online. But I do agree, the Xbox 360 was amazing and will likely be the one and only time Microsoft was at the top of the console gaming market. </p><p>&nbsp;.<br></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
