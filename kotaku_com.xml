              <p>Since Black Friday Week started, Amazon has sold hundreds of thousands of Xbox controllers. Even though it’s now the weekend after Thanksgiving, there are still great deals on these gaming essentials but the problem is that a lot of the color options are already sold out. However, the famous <em>Carbon Black</em> version is still available this Saturday morning and is now at its lowest price ever: <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3732/">$39, down from its usual price of $64</a>. This is the <strong>2025 model with all the newest features</strong> and at this price, you’re getting Microsoft’s best controller for almost 40% less than what you’d normally pay.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3732/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Play on Any Platforms</h2>
<p>The new Xbox wireless controller has some important improvements over older models. For example, it works with more than just traditional gaming setups as you can can<strong> connect this controller to your Xbox Series X|S, Xbox One, Windows PC, Android devices, iOS devices, Fire TV Sticks, smart TVs, and even VR headsets</strong> without wires using Bluetooth. You only need to buy one controller that works with all of your devices so you don’t have to switch between different peripherals for different platforms.</p>
<p>Microsoft improved the ergonomics by adding a <strong>textured grip to the triggers, bumpers, and back case</strong>. This makes it easier to control the game for long periods of time. The hybrid D-pad has a faceted design that makes it easier to make both sweeping and exact directional inputs. This makes a big difference in fighting games and platformers where every input counts. The <strong>controller also has a dedicated Share button</strong> that lets you take screenshots and video clips without stopping the game which makes it easier to make content if you like streaming or just want to save special moments.</p>



<p>The included AA batteries last a long time and <strong>give you up to 40 hours of gameplay</strong>. If you want to use rechargeable batteries instead, you can switch to the Play and Charge Kit. You can now keep a stable connection up to 30 feet away from your device, which gives you more options for how to set up your gaming area. Dynamic latency input technology makes the time between pressing a button and an action on the screen shorter. This makes the game feel more responsive, which competitive gamers will love, but casual gamers will also benefit from it.</p>
<p>The Carbon Black color is the <strong>classic Xbox look that never goes out of style</strong>: It has a matte finish that doesn’t show fingerprints as easily as glossy finishes. The housing is sturdy and doesn’t flex or creak, and the buttons give satisfying feedback without being too loud. You can also use the Xbox Accessories app to change the buttons on your controller to fit your needs for certain games or accessibility, which is more customization than most third-party controllers offer.</p>
<p>For $39, you get the newest controller technology from Microsoft which is less than what last generation’s model usually costs. The price is at an all-time low, and the improvements coming in 2025 will make it even better.</p>

              <p>LEGO makes a lot more than just toys for kids: This PAC-MAN arcade cabinet is an example of one of their adult-focused sets that are meant to be displayed rather than played with. This collectible, which is based on nostalgia, recreates <strong>the classic arcade experience from the 1980s with 2,651 pieces of real detail</strong> that both gamers and LEGO collectors will love.</p>
<p>During Black Friday,<a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6067/"> this set is only $188 on Amazon, down from $269</a> and it is a record-low 30% discount that beats all previous prices. Since it came out, the set has stubbornly kept its $269 launch price with only short sales bringing it down to around $230. This price of $188 is a huge change that will create a lot of value and cause buying frenzies as word spreads through LEGO and gaming communities.</p>

<h2>Bring 1980s Games to Life</h2>
<p>The <strong>functional 4-way joystick moves in a way that feels like real arcade controls</strong> with satisfying clicks as you change directions. The coin slot lights up when you press it, and the score display can be changed to show high scores that are special to you like personal gaming achievements or inside jokes. When you open the back panel, you can see the engineering magic that makes static bricks look like they’re moving.</p>



<p>The <strong>rotating display base has figures of PAC-MAN, Blinky, and Clyde</strong> that change direction and behavior when you press buttons which makes for dynamic presentations instead of static poses. As you move through the positions, watch characters switch from chase mode to fleeing mode, just like in the power pellet moment when the hunted becomes the hunter.</p>
<p>The <strong>1980s arcade scene with a gaming mini-figure gives the cabinet a sense of place</strong> in its cultural moment instead of showing it in isolation. The vignette captures the arcade atmosphere where kids fed quarters into machines for hours, bringing back memories for anyone who lived through that time. LEGO’s dedication to authenticity is shown in the way they style their mini-figures, choose their accessories, and add environmental elements.</p>



<p>The<strong> 12.5-inch height makes a big impression on a desk</strong> or shelf without taking over like huge sets with more than 5,000 pieces that are more than two feet tall. The size is perfect for office desks, where the cabinet shows that you like retro games without looking like a toy collection; bedroom shelves, where it goes well with other gaming memorabilia; or entertainment center displays, where it fits in with modern consoles.</p>
<p>The 2,651 pieces make for a satisfying level of building difficulty that<strong> takes experienced builders about 8 to 12 hours to complete</strong>, which makes it a good weekend project or evening building session that lasts for several days. This number of pieces strikes a balance between being fun and easy to get to.</p>
<p>The LEGO PAC-MAN Arcade is now 30% cheaper than the stubborn $269 price that has been in place since it came out, thanks to the record-low Black Friday price of $188. If you’ve wanted this set but didn’t want to pay the usual price, this Black Friday deal makes nostalgic LEGO engineering available before it sells out.</p>
