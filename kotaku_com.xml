              <p>TV audio quality has improved dramatically over the years, but slim modern displays sacrifice speaker quality for sleek designs and leave you with tinny sound that undermines your viewing experience. Finding space for full surround sound systems proves challenging in apartments or smaller living rooms where bulky speakers and subwoofers simply don’t fit the layout.</p>
<p>Sonos has built its reputation on delivering premium audio in compact formats and the Beam (Gen 2) addresses the soundbar needs of space-conscious homes without compromising performance: This <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5728/">Dolby Atmos soundbar currently sells for $369 on Amazon, down from its regular $499 price</a>, and marks an all-time low for one of the most respected names in home audio.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5728/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>A small package with immersive audio</h2>
<p>The <strong>Dolby Atmos support makes soundscapes that are three-dimensional</strong> and puts sounds above, around, and next to you instead of just in front of you. This adds depth that regular stereo soundbars can’t match. Height channels bounce sound off your ceiling to make it sound like helicopters are flying by or rain is falling from above. This makes the scenes feel more real. The effect works best in rooms with flat ceilings that are less than 10 feet high. It can’t match dedicated ceiling speakers, but the virtual height makes the soundstage seem very big.</p>
<p>One of the most common complaints about TV audio is that voices get lost in music and sound effects and the <strong>crystal clear dialogue reproduction</strong> fixes this. Sonos designed a separate center channel processing system that focuses on vocal frequencies, so you can hear every word without having to change the volume all the time. Speech Enhancement mode makes speech even clearer when needed. This is helpful during shows with strong accents or lines that are hard to understand that would otherwise need subtitles.</p>



<p>The <strong>200-watt maximum output</strong> gives you enough volume to fill medium to large rooms without distortion. It also pushes clean sound even when the volume is high, when cheaper soundbars start to crackle. The frequency response goes down to 50.4Hz, which gives explosions and music a nice bass presence without needing a subwoofer. You’ll feel the low-end impact during action scenes and bass-heavy songs, but bass lovers might want to get Sonos’ dedicated Sub for really low frequencies that shake the room. The<strong> small size of 25.6 inches wide</strong> makes it easy to fit under most TVs without blocking screens or making entertainment centers too big.</p>
<p>The <strong>Trueplay tuning technology uses the microphone on your iPhone or iPad to figure out how sound travels in your room</strong> and then automatically changes the soundbar’s output for the best sound. The app plays test tones while you walk around the room. It measures how sound bounces off of walls, furniture, and ceilings to make a custom EQ profile. This calibration makes up for acoustic problems like putting speakers in corners or on bare walls, which would otherwise change the sound. This makes sure that the sound is always the same, no matter how the room is set up.</p>



<p>You only need two cables to set it up: The HDMI eARC cable connects to your TV for sound, and the power cable plugs into an outlet. With an HDMI connection, all of your TV’s audio sources can be sent through a single cable which means you don’t have to connect each device directly to the soundbar. The Beam knows when you turn on your TV and turns on automatically. You can also use your current TV remote to change the volume without having to program anything else.</p>
<p>Getting the Sonos Beam Gen 2 for $369 is a great deal because it’s the lowest price this model has ever been at and you’re getting high-quality audio engineering from a top company. The lowest price ever makes Sonos quality affordable for people who thought it was too expensive before, and the timing right before the holiday season makes it the perfect time to upgrade.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/sony-offloads-dualsense-edge-at-record-low-pro-gamers-get-elite-controller-at-casual-gamer-price-2000653974</link>

              <p>Professional gaming demands precision and customization that standard controllers simply cannot provide, and <strong>the DualSense Edge addresses these needs with hardware-level adjustments</strong> that competitive players have requested for years. This premium controller takes everything great about the standard DualSense and adds swappable components, remappable buttons, and adjustable sensitivity curves that let you fine-tune performance for specific games or playstyles.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5850/">Midnight Black edition currently sells for $169 on Amazon, down from its regular $199 price</a>, and <strong>marks an all-time low for Sony’s pro-level controlle</strong>r just before Christmas with <strong>guaranteed holiday delivery</strong>. That 15% discount makes advanced gaming hardware more accessible to serious players who want every possible advantage without spending Xbox Elite controller money.</p>

<h2>Personalization That Fits Your Style of Play</h2>
<p>You <strong>can now map back buttons to the bottom of the controller</strong> which changes the way you play games. You can assign actions you use a lot to these buttons. You can assign any face button action, like jump, crouch, or reload, to these back paddles. This way, you can keep your thumbs on the analog sticks when you need to press face buttons. This constant contact with the stick makes it easier to aim in shooters and keeps control of the camera in action games where split-second reactions can change the outcome.</p>
<p>The<strong> replaceable stick modules fix the problem of analog stick drift</strong> that happens to controllers after a lot of use. When the old ones wear out, you can just put in new ones. When sticks start to drift, you have to buy a whole new controller with traditional controllers. With the Edge, you can just replace the worn parts for a lot less money. You can easily switch out the modules without any tools, and Sony sells replacement modules separately so you can keep using them.</p>



<p>You can change how much stick movement counts as input by changing the stick sensitivity and dead zones. This lets you change the response curves to fit your needs and preferences in the game. High sensitivity settings are good for fast-paced shooters where quick camera movements are important. Lower sensitivity settings are better for long-range shooting where accuracy is important. Dead zone adjustments get rid of the unwanted movement that can happen with looser sticks, making it easier to control in competitive play.</p>
<p>The <strong>stick caps that come with it come in three heights and two shapes</strong> so you can pick the ones that fit your hand size and grip style. Taller sticks give you better control because they make your thumb move a longer distance for the same input. This is helpful for precise aiming in tactical shooters. Shorter sticks let you move faster with less thumb travel, which is better for aggressive playstyles in games that need quick changes of direction.</p>



<p>The <strong>trigger stops shorten the distance that L2 and R2 can travel</strong> which lets you fully press the trigger faster for quick firing in shooters. The adjustable stops click into place at different points, and you can change each trigger to fit the needs of the game. Full trigger travel is better for racing games that use analog throttle control, while minimal travel is better for shooters who want to shoot faster.</p>
<p>The Midnight Black colorway gives the Edge a stealthy look that sets it apart from regular controllers while still keeping PlayStation’s clean design style. The matte finish doesn’t show fingerprints as much as glossy plastics, and the high-quality materials feel solid in your hand. Because of the extra electronics, the battery life is shorter than that of standard DualSense controllers. It <strong>usually lasts 5 to 7 hours, depending on how many features you use</strong> which means that you’ll need to keep the charging cable close by during long gaming sessions.</p>
<p>Getting the DualSense Edge for $169 is a great deal because it’s the lowest price this controller has ever been on Amazon and it lets you customize it like a pro. The lowest prices ever make it easier for serious gamers to get pro-level features that they couldn’t afford before.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Anker SOLIX C1000 at Record Low for Christmas on Amazon, Charge 10 Devices With 2,000W Output at Once]]></title>
            <link>https://kotaku.com/anker-solix-c1000-at-record-low-for-christmas-on-amazon-charge-10-devices-with-2000w-output-at-once-2000653967</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>When storms knock out power in the winter, portable power stations are very important because you need backup power for heating, medical devices, or just to stay connected in case of an emergency. The <strong>Anker Solix C1000</strong> (Gen 2) fixes the main problems with older portable power stations by charging much faster and giving off more power.</p>
<p>This <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4782/">newer model is now $371 on Amazon, down from its regular price of $549</a> and it is close to the lowest price ever, just before Christmas when power outages caused by bad weather become more common. The <strong>32% discount makes it easy to get serious backup power</strong> without having to deal with the hassle and cost of installing whole-home generators.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4782/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Charging Speed That Makes All the Difference</h2>
<p>When you plug the HyperFlash technology into a wall outlet, it <strong>recharges the whole 1,024Wh battery in just 49 minutes</strong> and it changes how you use portable power stations during long power outages. Traditional models take 6 to 8 hours to fully charge, which means you have to carefully ration power or risk running out at important times. This unit, on the other hand, lets you charge it up during short power restoration periods: If the power goes out for a short time, you can drain the battery that powers important devices and then fully charge it during a one-hour lunch break.</p>



<p>With a <strong>continuous output of 2,000W and a surge capacity of 3,000W</strong>, it can easily handle most power tools and household appliances. The 1<strong>0 ports include AC outlets, USB-A ports, USB-C ports, and a car outlet</strong> and you can use all of them at the same time to run your refrigerator, space heater, coffee maker, and phone charger. The 3,000W surge rating can handle the spike that motors make when appliances first turn on, so your refrigerator compressor won’t shut down when it starts up or your circular saw won’t stop spinning when it starts up.</p>



<p>The <strong>LiFePO4 battery chemistry can be charged 4,000 times before it drops to 80% capacity</strong> which means that you can use it every day for about 10 years before you notice a big drop in capacity. Lithium iron phosphate batteries work better in extreme temperatures than regular lithium-ion cells. They keep working in hot summer cars and cold winter garages, where other types of batteries have trouble.</p>
<p>When the power goes out,<strong> the under-10ms UPS switchover time keeps sensitive electronics</strong> like CPAP machines, computers, and networking equipment running without a hitch. When the power goes out, traditional power stations take hundreds of milliseconds to find the problem and switch to battery power. This can cause computers to restart or medical devices to sound an alarm.</p>
<p>Getting the Solix C1000 Gen 2 for $371 is a great deal because you get advanced charging technology and a lot of storage space for almost half the regular price. The almost-record discount makes professional-grade backup power affordable for families that couldn’t afford to buy generators before. The timing is perfect because it’s right before winter storm season, so you can get ready before you really need it. This Christmas deal is too good to pass up for anyone who needs backup power or off-grid capabilities.</p>
