If you don’t count the time it takes to wait for the game to boot up, you can likely unlock him in about three minutes and without even skating at all. </p><h2 id="h75499"><a id=""></a>How to quickly unlock Bam Margera in <em>THPS 3+4</em></h2><p>All you need to do is head over to the character select screen, click on one of the bottom boxes that contains a plus icon instead of a face, and create a character. You don’t even have to change any of the details, like the character’s name or hometown. Just mash through that screen. Doing so will complete a challenge. </p><p>Next, hop over to the challenge menu and look for an exclamation mark indicating a completed challenge. Open up that marked challenge and claim your reward of $5,000 in-game dollars. Then just shoot over to the shop menu and visit the “Secrets” section to find <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://tonyhawkgames.fandom.com/wiki/Bam_Margera#Tony_Hawk's_Pro_Skater_3_+_4&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://tonyhawkgames.fandom.com/wiki/Bam_Margera#Tony_Hawk's_Pro_Skater_3_+_4" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Bam Margera</a></span>. He costs $5,000 to unlock, and if you’ve created a character—like I <em>told</em> you to—you’ll have all the money you need to buy Bam. </p><p>Now he’s a playable skater in your game and you can play all of <em>THPS 3+4</em> as West Chester’s famous jackass. </p><p>I find it very interesting that the game locks Bam behind such a relatively small amount of money and makes it so that most players will quickly stumble into $5,000 early on. Even the reward text for creating a character seems to reference the skater, telling players not to spend it all in one place, before teasing that maybe they should do that. </p><p>If I were a conspiratorial person, I’d ponder this scenario: <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/tony-hawk-activision-bam-margera-added-thps-3-4-remake-1851772278&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/tony-hawk-activision-bam-margera-added-thps-3-4-remake-1851772278">Tony Hawk reportedly pushed for Bam Margera</a></span> to be added to the game very late in the process. That could have meant it was tricky to add him to the full roster, so they added him as a secret character, but they really wanted people to be able to play as him. It’s been nearly two decades since Bam was in a <em>Tony Hawk </em>game! So the devs set his price to something pretty low and made it easy to unlock him within minutes of booting the game, effectively making him a playable character right from the moment you start.<br></p><p>Regardless, you’ve probably stopped reading this blog ages ago because you went to unlock him<em>.</em> So I’ll just keep thinking about this grand conspiracy alone. </p><p> .<br></p></div></div><br/><br/>https://kotaku.com/thps-3-4-bam-margera-how-to-unlock-easy-fast-tip-guide-1851785804]]></content:encoded>

She has a family and a life here on their farm in Jackson, and that is something precious in this post-apocalyptic world. Fist-fighting your sworn enemy can’t be more important than that, right? Nevertheless, Ellie leaves her idyllic farm life and ventures across state lines once more to see if this time, it will make her feel something. It’s been five years since that game came out, and lately I feel like I’ve been caught in that same cycle of violence, cutting away at my own sanity to spite an assembly line that will not let one of my favorite games of all time rest.

That doesn’t detract from the original experience, nor does it make it any less the ‘canonical’ version of the story.” Sure, disembodied voice. Devoid of all other context surrounding this game and franchise, it just sounds like a neat way to experience a story the second time around. If it were an unlockable mode that becomes available after you finish the game for the first time, maybe I could buy into that. People have made <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R9TZQ2eKkdY&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R9TZQ2eKkdY" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">YouTube videos</a></span> based on this very idea. However, the Chronological Experience didn’t just fall out of a coconut tree. It exists in the context of all in which it lives and what came before it.</p><p>To call <em>The Last of Us Part II </em>a divisive game <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/last-of-us-part-2-abby-laura-bailey-threats-grounded-1851222035&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/last-of-us-part-2-abby-laura-bailey-threats-grounded-1851222035">would be a massive understatement</a></span>, but a core part of what made it such a prickly game for some folks was the way it walled off the player from certain vital context until a deliberate moment. This is why the flashback-heavy format is so crucial to the story it tells, and is one of the many reasons HBO’s show feels like a fundamental misunderstanding of the story it’s adapting. Denying the player cathartic, easy answers is a core part of <em>The Last of Us Part II</em>, and laying out its story in the most straightforward, literal way feels like capitulating to an audience that already didn’t like the story you told in the first place, whether they knew why Abby killed Joel early on or not. There are plenty of criticisms to be thrown at <em>Part II</em>, but you can’t say it wasn’t deliberate in the experience it was trying to convey. I’m going to quote a guy who has written about this series extensively over the years (it’s me), who <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/last-of-us-hbo-max-season-2-episode-2-joel-abby-death-1851776976&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/last-of-us-hbo-max-season-2-episode-2-joel-abby-death-1851776976">wrote this about the show in one of his episodic recaps</a></span> when talking about how HBO re-arranged parts of the narrative in what felt like an attempt to avoid some of the blowback the game received in 2020:</p><p>“[HBO’s] <em>The Last of Us</em> is so preoccupied with recounting plot points like a Wikipedia summary that it lacks any real insight into why those events were arranged in a way that made them meaningful to play through.”</p><p><em>The Last of Us Part II </em>remains one of the boldest games in the AAA space, and that boldness has been categorically undermined at nearly every turn by Sony, Naughty Dog, and HBO ever since.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Blue Prince </em>is one of the most acclaimed puzzle games ever made, yet I almost put it down for good within ten hours of playing. Don’t get me wrong, I love puzzle games and roguelikes. I just quickly felt overwhelmed as I tried to gather clues and contend with the ever-changing Mt. Holly manor every in-game day. I started to think that this acclaimed mystery just wasn’t for me…until my girlfriend sat beside me on my couch and started to enjoy it with me.</p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="195891" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="The Week In Games: What’s Coming Out Beyond Alan Wake 2" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="156" data-playlist="195891,196013,195301" data-current="195891"><div><p>The Week In Games: What’s Coming Out Beyond Alan Wake 2</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195891/195891_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195891/195891_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195891/195891_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195891/195891_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/21406.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>No disrespect to Hazelight Studios’ stellar <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/split-fiction-review-hazelight-coop-game-it-takes-two-1851767470&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/split-fiction-review-hazelight-coop-game-it-takes-two-1851767470"><em>Split Fiction</em></a></span>, but <em>Blue Prince</em> is one of my favorite co-op games of 2025. The <em>House of Leaves</em>-esque premise is reminiscent of tabletop puzzle games, and the roguelike structure is somehow perfect for two or more people to enjoy together. Here’s what a second set of eyes brings to this otherwise single player experience.</p><h2 id="h51277"><a id="1"></a>The notebook is a controller</h2><p>To solve every riddle in <em>Blue Prince </em>yourself, you’ll need pen and paper by your side. That’s not an exaggeration: The game <em>literally </em>tells you to take notes, as the clues you find in one room might become relevant several in-game days later in a totally different location. If you’re flying solo, this can feel overwhelming to manage. There’s just so much to take in that constantly stopping to jot down notes can seriously slow your progression.</p><p>This is where a second person helps a lot! Not only does it help to talk through certain puzzles (looking at you, Parlor Room), a pair of hands dedicated to note taking means you don’t have to constantly stop to record observations. Additionally, when a second person can focus on reviewing notes during downtime, you’re both more likely to find that one missing link you need to overcome any especially baffling puzzles.</p><h2 id="h51278"><a id="2"></a>The roguelike structure makes it easy to take turns</h2><p>Lest you think I’m encouraging player two to take on all the stuff you don’t want to do, the design of <em>Blue Prince</em> makes it easy to alternate who’s in the hot seat. Since this is a roguelike, the end of a run marks a convenient time to hand off the controller to your partner so you can become the notetaker for the next run. You’ll (probably) feel ready for a break after an hour-long run anyway, and your partner can start with a mostly clean slate as they get their bearings with the game.</p><figure id="" data-id="50f3305a824df27c317471c8a19ad070" data-recommend-id="image://50f3305a824df27c317471c8a19ad070" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A screenshot of Blue Prince.

A dartboard is shown with certain sections lit up in either purple, blue, or red." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>This approach directly helps with puzzle solving too! It’s easy to get caught in a loop of exploring the same rooms repeatedly because you rely on certain items or resources. Watching someone else play lets you see rooms or details you wouldn’t normally notice yourself, or you might notice a clue that you want to pursue during your next run. <em>Blue Prince</em> is all about information gathering, and a different perspective makes that pursuit much easier.</p><h2 id="h51279"><a id="3"></a>All the action is cerebral</h2><p>This technically applies to all puzzle games, and it’s doubly true of <em>Blue Prince</em>. No challenge in this game is a test of reflexes or memorizing complex combos; you’re here to read books, gather clues, and solve riddles. For this reason, you don’t need to be in literal control of <em>Blue Prince </em>to <em>play</em> <em>Blue Prince</em>. Two or more people can easily contribute to looking around a room, pointing out details that might be relevant later, or dissecting a vague note that might be helpful later.</p><figure id="" data-id="a32879cb00a6193b9f465304cdbbfbe3" data-recommend-id="image://a32879cb00a6193b9f465304cdbbfbe3" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A screenshot of Blue Prince.

Notes and pictures are pinned to a board." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>More importantly, <em>Blue Prince</em> expects you to crack these granular puzzles while you simultaneously manage your stock of keys, gems, and steps to make the most out of your in-game day. This can feel stressful, especially in the early game. However, with two or more people, you can divide up the cognitive load to make the game more digestible. For example, I typically handled the resource management and house layout, while my girlfriend specialized in room exploration and picking out details that’d become helpful later. </p><p><br>You don’t have to follow this formula to a tee, of course. For best results, chat with your unofficial <em>Blue Prince</em> co-op partner about your strengths and weaknesses when it comes to puzzle solving, and come up with a game plan that works for you. Regardless of what you come up with, just exchanging notes and hints with another person is one of the most fun parts of <em>Blue Prince</em>. It’s an experience well worth sharing, and if it still doesn’t turn out to be your cup of tea, well, maybe you can give <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/split-fiction-review-hazelight-coop-game-it-takes-two-1851767470&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/split-fiction-review-hazelight-coop-game-it-takes-two-1851767470"><em>Split Fiction</em></a></span> the respect I’ve so wrongfully snubbed it of instead.</p><p>.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://kotaku.com/blue-prince-puzzle-co-op-players-puzzles-roguelike-1851785805]]></content:encoded>
