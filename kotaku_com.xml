To celebrate, Blizzard released a new animated trailer featuring her doing some sick acrobatic tricks and taking out synthetic omnic goons. That’s all well and good, but what fans are honing in on are the final moments in which Freja is given a bounty hunting contract that hints at a long-awaited character finally making their debut. However, if you’re not super tuned into <em>Overwatch </em>lore, you might have no idea who he is.</p><p>Emre Sarioglu is a Turkish hero from the titular organization’s heyday before the events of the games, and has appeared only a few times in the series’ extended lore. His most prominent appearance is in a group photo of much of the OG team with a young Pharah; otherwise he’s mostly only been seen in the margins of the lore in things like the <em>Overwatch: Declassified </em>book. Sojourn has a voice line in <em>Overwatch 2 </em>saying Emre wanted to retire to Havana, but that’s pretty much it. The guy’s mostly an enigma, and that mystery has made him a bit of a running joke within the <em>Overwatch </em>community. Now, however, it seems like Blizzard may actually be bringing him into the fold with Freja, and fans are losing it.</p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="196880" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="Ranking Overwatch 2 Season 10's Biggest Changes" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="218" data-playlist="196880,195460,196049" data-current="196880"><div><p>Ranking Overwatch 2 Season 10's Biggest Changes</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196880/196880_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196880/196880_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196880/196880_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196880/196880_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/22434.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>While it’s exciting that we might finally learn more about Emre, it’s unclear if this thread will be picked up any time soon. <em>Overwatch </em>loves to introduce characters in external media and then not get back to them for several years. For example, Mauga was first introduced in the short story <em>What You Left Behind </em>in 2019 and wasn’t added to the roster until <em>Overwatch 2</em>’s eighth season in 2023. At the very least we know Blizzard hasn’t completely forgotten him.</p><p>Freja’s test period will last from March 21 to 24; she’ll then officially join the roster in season 16 on April 22.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

After the game’s opening act, your first line of business is to find Tomiko and establish your hideout. This is your base of operations where you’ll accrue allies and build facilities, though you’ll quickly find one of the most valuable ones is locked off: the Forge. You’ll see that this building has the prerequisite “Recruit a Blacksmith,” so naturally, you’ll want to knock that off your to-do list.</p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="195776" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="The Week In Games: What’s Coming Out Beyond Assassin's Creed Mirage" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="157" data-playlist="195776,195922,196345" data-current="195776"><div><p>The Week In Games: What’s Coming Out Beyond Assassin's Creed Mirage</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195776/195776_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195776/195776_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195776/195776_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195776/195776_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/21286.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p><strong>To get your own blacksmith, look for the quest “Way Of The Blacksmith” in the Objectives tab of your main menu under Tomiko’s icon</strong>. You might recall that Tomiko mentions recruiting a blacksmith named Heiji in the cutscene where she and Naoe discuss the first two Onryo to hunt, so you’ll almost certainly have access to this quest if you’re reading this. Of course, assuming you’re playing on the game’s default settings, you’ll have to do a tiny bit of legwork to track Heiji down, so you can check out his location below if you just want to get to him right away.</p><h2 id="h4530"><a id=""></a>’The Way Of The Blacksmith’ quest location</h2><p>As the game’s hints directly indicate, <strong>Heiji is located in Sekai</strong>. <strong>You’ll find this area directly southwest of the hideout</strong>. Sekai is also where you’ll begin your hunt for the Golden Teppo, so you can kill two birds with one stone by going there first. Well, technically you kill one bird and recruit another bird, but you get the picture.</p><figure id="" data-id="533b6b01d42b410b8e920346ea2ccec3" data-recommend-id="image://533b6b01d42b410b8e920346ea2ccec3" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A screenshot of the map in Assassin’s Creed: Shadows.

A blue diamond is visible slightly north-northeast of the center of Sekai." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Once you arrive, you’ll find Heiji under attack by a group of bandits. They’re common foes, so dispatch them however you please; you can easily complete this battle even if you’ve not bothered to level up or grab new equipment. Talk with Hieji after the battle and you’ll learn about the circumstances that have broken his spirit. Pick whichever dialogue option feels best to you, and Heiji will make his way to Tomiko’s hideout. Once you gather enough resources, you’ll finally be able to build a forge at your hideout.</p><h2 id="h4531"><a id=""></a>How to best use the Blacksmith</h2><figure id="" data-id="dc27ad6ee1d80021a144eedc27265b77" data-recommend-id="image://dc27ad6ee1d80021a144eedc27265b77" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A screenshot from Assassin’s Creed: Shadows.

Naoe is standing in front of Heiji inside the Forge." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>With the Forge now built, run to wherever you parked your shiny new building and look for Heiji. Upon talking with him, you’ll have access to the following options:</p><p><strong>Upgrade</strong>: Invest resources into any piece of equipment to increase its level. Equipment cannot be higher than your character’s level (level equivalent gear simply won’t appear). You can use Gold to immediately upgrade a piece of equipment to your current level, but Gold is a rare resource that should not be confused with normal currency (Mon). <strong>Save your Gold for bigger upgrades down the road; don’t use it by accident in the early game</strong>!</p><p><strong>Engrave</strong>: Apply one of your found Engravings to an applicable piece of gear (it will say “Visit the Hideout’s blacksmith to engrave a perk” under its stats). Engravings are not consumed upon use and can be overridden, though note this process will consume Mon every time.</p><p><strong>Salvage</strong>: Break down a piece of gear into upgrade materials.<br></p><p>In short, if you find a great piece of gear that proves essential to your build, come here to refine it as you play to keep its stats relevant. And if you’re just beginning your journey in <em>Assassin’s Creed Shadows</em>, be sure to keep some resources on hand for when Yasuke joins your party! <br></p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
