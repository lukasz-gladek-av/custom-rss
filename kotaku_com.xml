              <p>Buying a new desktop computer can be a bit of a bear, especially if you want something that can both save you some space and money. But because we’re here to help, we’ve found something that satisfies both conditions and then some: the KAMRUI AM21 Mini Desktop wth an AMD Ryzen 7 processor.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6659/">You can purchase the KAMRUI AM21 Mini Desktop for $499 from Amazon (originally priced at $699), which nets you a discount of $200 or 29% off.</a> That’s nothing to sneeze at, so if you’re ready to plunk your cold, hard cash down on, it’s go time.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6659/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>A mini PC that has all the bells and whistles of its larger cousin</h2>
<p>The KAMRUI AM21 Mini Desktop features an AMD Ryzen 7 8745HS processor, 32GB of DDR5 5600 MHz memory, and a 1TB M.2 2280 NVME PCIe 4.0 SSD in a space-saving desktop chassis. This is an 8-core, 16-thread chip that runs up to 4.9 GHz and has integrated Radeon 780M graphics that provide smooth 1080P gaming resources. In other words, it’s deceptively powerful, despite its small size. And that means you can put it just about anywhere and still expect some serious performance.</p>
<p>Storage begins with a 1 TB M.2 2280 NVMe PCIe 4.0 x4 SSD, but there are two M.2 2280 slots available for expansion. These can accommodate up to 4 TB of NVMe storage. Although the listing mentions that SATA SSD expansion is not supported, users will need to utilize NVMe SSDs when expanding their storage.</p>



<p>This mini-desktop ships with Windows 11 Pro, KAMRUI Care support, and Amazon’s standard product support options. That means there are tons of ways to get help, so if you find yourself needing it, it’s there for you. You never know what kinds of issues can crop up when you’re setting up a new computer.</p>
<p>Pound for pound, this is a small but mighty computer that can replace a typical desktop or laptop, depending on which one you use regularly. And you can’t forget how much you’re saving on it, as well as how small it is in comparison to the commonly-accepted desktops on the market. You can get a ton done with it, and then some. Then you’ll even have some money left over to buy accessories or other items should you need to finish outfitting your work area. Or your casual home office, whichever ends up becoming true.</p>
<p>If your New Year’s resolution is to get a better PC that can improve your productivity and make things easier, this is an excellent pick. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6659/">Just act quickly, because this deal likely won’t be around for long, and it isn’t the type of discount you’ll not want to sink your teeth into.</a></p>

            <guid>1397098</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p data-start="0" data-end="552">Drones come in a crazy wide range of styles and performance levels for a variety of use cases. Some of the more affordable options are essentially just toys, ideal for casual fun at parties or for quick park outings with friends. This is not one of those drones. The DJI Mavic 4 Pro is a premium-grade model specifically built for professional aerial photography and videography. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6658/">Normally priced at $2,699 on Amazon, it’s currently available for a reduced price of $2,199—a $500 discount. Kick off the new year with an awesome new piece of tech.</a></p>
<p data-start="554" data-end="1321">For professionals seeking a versatile drone, the DJI Mavic 4 Pro is exceptional. This model features three distinct cameras. First, there’s a 28mm Hasselblad camera that boasts a massive 100MP resolution, perfect for wide-angle shots. Additionally, a 70mm medium telephoto camera offers 48MP, and a 168mm telephoto camera provides 50MP for capturing detailed close-ups from a distance. With the combination of the main lens and two telephoto lenses, you can achieve sharp, high-quality zoom shots, as well as breathtaking wide shots. The dynamic 360-degree gimbal system ensures smooth, stable camera movement, whether you’re shooting cinematic sequences for a film or broadcasting live sports events.</p>

<p data-start="1323" data-end="1624">Tracking your subject with precision is key for drone photography, and the DJI Mavic 4 Pro makes this easier than ever. The ActiveTrack system enables 360-degree vehicle tracking, allowing the drone to follow moving subjects from as far as 200 meters away, all while maintaining awareness of its surroundings.</p>
<p data-start="1626" data-end="1915">The included DJI RC 2 controller enhances the flying experience with its 7-inch, bright, and rotatable screen, making it easy to monitor your footage while keeping your focus on the drone’s performance. The controller is also collapsible, making storage and transportation more convenient.</p>


<h2>Fly Safely, Even at Night</h2>
<p data-start="1917" data-end="2309">The DJI Mavic 4 Pro is capable of capturing stunning visuals even in low-light environments. Thanks to its 0.1-Lux nightscape omnidirectional obstacle sensor, the drone can detect nearby objects in the dark, preventing potential collisions even when visibility is limited. This makes it an excellent option for shooting after the sun sets or in dimly lit conditions.</p>
<p data-start="2311" data-end="2721">The Mavic 4 Pro offers an impressive flight time of up to 51 minutes on a single charge, giving you ample time to capture long, cinematic shots. It also comes with 64GB of onboard storage, which can be expanded up to 512GB if needed. You can easily transfer photos and videos to your smartphone via the DJI Fly app, with transfer speeds of up to 80MB/s, all without having to remove the SD card from the drone.</p>
<p data-start="2723" data-end="2905" data-is-last-node="" data-is-only-node=""><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6658/">Now is the perfect time to get the DJI Mavic 4 Pro as it sits with a significant $500 discount.</a> Take advantage of this limited-time offer and elevate your aerial photography and videography game.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/xbox-series-x-hits-all-time-low-with-controller-included-to-clear-out-stock-while-playstation-stays-at-full-price-2000656517</link>
            <guid>1397083</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p data-start="0" data-end="518">If the holidays came and went without the new gaming console you were hoping to unwrap, Amazon is offering a solid second chance to treat yourself. Right now, you can pick up the Xbox Series X and finally experience Microsoft’s most powerful console in stunning 4K. The standard retail price for the Xbox Series X has recently settled at $650, but for a limited time, Amazon is discounting it by 8%. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6384/">That price drop knocks $50 off the total, bringing the console down to $600—a meaningful savings given today’s market.</a></p>
<p data-start="520" data-end="1351">Okay, let’s pause for a moment to get a lesson on Xbox Series X’s unusual pricing history. When Microsoft launched the Xbox Series X alongside the Series S back in 2020, the flagship console carried a $500 price tag. That price held steady for years, which is typical for console generations. However, in May 2025, Microsoft announced a price increase, bumping the Series X up by $100 to $600. Just a few months later, the company raised the price again, pushing it to $650. This makes the current generation one of the rare cases where console prices have increased rather than dropped over time. With that context in mind, Amazon’s current deal effectively brings the Series X back to its 2025 spring and summer pricing.</p>

<h2 data-start="1353" data-end="1819">Xbox Series X vs. Xbox Series S</h2>
<p data-start="1353" data-end="1819">When comparing the Xbox Series X to its more budget-friendly sibling, the Xbox Series S, the reasons for the price difference become clear. One of the biggest advantages of the Series X is its ability to run games in native 4K resolution. While both consoles support high refresh rates of up to 120 frames per second and HDR visuals, the Series X is built for players who want the sharpest image quality possible on modern displays.</p>
<p data-start="1821" data-end="2145">Another major distinction is the inclusion of a disc drive on the Series X. This is a big deal for players who prefer owning physical copies of their games or who already have a collection of discs. Beyond gaming, the console can also double as a Blu-ray player, making it a useful addition to your home entertainment setup.</p>


<p data-start="2147" data-end="2690">Both the Xbox Series X and Series S rely on Microsoft’s Xbox Velocity Architecture, which is responsible for the fast load times that define this console generation. This technology also powers Quick Resume, a feature that lets you suspend and switch between multiple games. Instead of closing out a game and rebooting it to the start screen later, Quick Resume saves your exact progress and returns you to the same spot when you jump back in. It’s especially convenient if you like to bounce between different games without worrying about finding a save point every time.</p>
<p data-start="2692" data-end="2971">The Xbox Series X also functions as a complete media hub. You can download popular streaming apps like YouTube, Netflix, HBO Max, and Dropout, and enjoy supported content in full 4K with HDR.</p>
<p data-start="2973" data-end="3476" data-is-last-node="" data-is-only-node="">To get the most out of the Xbox ecosystem, Game Pass Ultimate is well worth considering. The subscription includes online multiplayer through Xbox Live and access to a massive library of games you can download and play at any time. It’s often compared to Netflix, but for video games. One standout title in the Game Pass catalog is the critically acclaimed <em data-start="3330" data-end="3359">Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</em>. With numerous awards and glowing reviews, it’s a great example of the value Game Pass offers right out of the gate. You can hit the ground running with one of the best titles to come out last year.</p>
