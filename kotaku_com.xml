            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              
              <p>Last week, Electronic Arts and Battlefield Studios held a big <a href="https://kotaku.com/battlefield-6-bf6-dragging-people-multiplayer-reveal-ea-1851787385"><em>Battlefield 6</em></a> <a href="https://kotaku.com/battlefield-6-reveal-la-event-behind-the-scenes-brie-larson-ea-2000614190?utm_source=kotaku.com&amp;utm_medium=link&amp;utm_campaign=share">multiplayer reveal event in Los Angeles</a>. While there, <a href="https://kotaku.com/battlefield-6-preview-destruction-classes-bf3-bf4-1851787384">I got to go hands-on with the online military shooter</a> for a few hours and learned a lot about the game. And since then, EA has done interviews and shared more information about the highly anticipated sequel, which is set to arrive in a few months. There’s also a big open beta launching later this week that will go for a few weekends.</p> <p>So yeah, there’s a lot of<a href="https://kotaku.com/ea-guarantees-battlefield-6-will-run-at-60fps-or-more-on-all-platforms-2000614503"><em> Battlefield 6 </em>information flying around out there</a>. To help you out, I’ve grabbed seven pieces of info and cataloged them here for your convenience. All I ask in return is that if you see me on the battlefield, don’t snipe me right away. Please? Anyway, here are seven new pieces of info we’ve learned about <em>Battlefield 6</em> over the last few days.</p> <h2><strong>When does the <em>Battlefield 6</em> open beta start?</strong></h2> <p>EA has split the <a href="https://kotaku.com/battlefield-6-bf6-dragging-people-multiplayer-reveal-ea-1851787385"><em>Battlefield 6</em></a> open beta into three sessions. The first starts on Thursday, August 7, and runs until August 9. But you’ll need an early access code to play during this first window. Does that mean this is no longer an “open” beta? I’d say so, but whatever. Then, from August 9 until August 10, anyone who has downloaded the <em>Battlefield 6</em> open beta can start playing, with or without a code. The beta will wrap up early that Monday and then go live again on Thursday, August 14. This third session is also completely open and will end in the early morning hours on August 17.&nbsp; The <em>BF6</em> beta will be available on PC, PS5, and Xbox Series X/S and can be pre-loaded now.</p>

 <p>Here’s a full schedule courtesy of EA and Battlefield Studios:</p> <ul> <li> <blockquote><p><em>Battlefield 6</em> early access beta</p> <ul> <li>From Thursday, Aug. 7 @ 1am PDT / 4am EDT / 9am BST to Saturday, Aug. 9 @ 1am PDT / 4am EDT / 9am BST</li> </ul> </blockquote> </li> <li> <blockquote><p><em>BF6</em> Open beta – first weekend</p> <ul> <li>From Saturday, Aug. 9 @ 1am PDT / 4am EDT / 9am BST to Monday, Aug. 10 @ 1am PDT / 4am EDT / 9am BST</li> </ul> </blockquote> </li> <li> <blockquote><p><em>BF6</em> Open beta – second (final) weekend</p></blockquote> <ul> <li> <blockquote><p>From Thursday, Aug.14 @ 1am PDT / 4am EDT / 9am BST to Sunday, Aug. 17 @ 1am PDT / 4am EDT / 9am BST</p></blockquote> </li> </ul> </li> </ul> <h2><strong><em>Battlefield 6</em> will feature bots to help fill servers</strong></h2> <p>Battlefield Studios and EA have confirmed that matches in <em>Battlefield 6</em> can include bots if there aren’t enough active players in the server. These bots will be replaced as more players join and will only return if people leave early. <em>Battlefield 6</em>&nbsp;development director <a href="https://gnn.gamer.com.tw/detail.php?sn=289987">Anna Narrevik explained in a recent interview</a> that they have designed the game to “allow as many players as possible to play the game at the same time.” But when there are gaps, the bots will show up to help out.</p> <p>I actually played against some bots during the <em>Battlefield 6</em> reveal event’s afterparty. They were pretty stupid, but could revive people and take points, so they weren’t completely worthless, and having them around did make the battle feel more alive and larger in scale. I’ll be curious to see how often I run into bots when playing certain modes in the game once it’s out.</p> <h2><strong>The game will use some skill-based matchmaking</strong></h2> <p>Yes, <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/battlefield-6-matchmaking-will-include-sbmm-among-other-things-like-ping-location-and-server-availability"><em>BF6</em> will partially use skill-based matchmaking</a> to place players into different servers and matches. But, before you grab a pitchfork and riot or throw a party in celebration, EA wants people to know that a player’s skill is just one of many variables used during <em>BF6</em>‘s matchmaking process. During a Q&amp;A at the event, <a href="https://x.com/charlieINTEL/status/1952011658143924686">as further reported by <em>CharlieIntel</em></a>, <em>Battlefield 6</em>‘s devs confirmed that numerous factors play a role in matchmaking. These include a player’s ping, location, what servers are available at that moment, and yes, skill factor.</p>

 <p>You might not think much about that, but for some players, skill-based matchmaking has become a dirty word, as they believe it makes shooters less fun as you are always matched up with people as good or better than you. Others think it keeps things balanced and more enjoyable. To me, it sounds like EA isn’t going to keep experts playing experts exclusively, but instead will try to keep teams balanced, something the series has done for a long time. So, until <em>Battlefield 6</em> is out, I think people can chill.</p> <p><iframe loading="lazy" title="Battlefield 6 Maps, Modes &amp; Portal" width="500" height="281" src="about:blank" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen="" data-rocket-lazyload="fitvidscompatible" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/92CHDiFW0wA?feature=oembed"></iframe></p> <h2><strong>There won’t be a traditional server browser in <em>Battlefield 6</em></strong></h2> <p>EA has confirmed that when <em>Battlefield 6</em> launches, it won’t include a traditional server browser. This is a feature that has been included in most <em>Battlefield</em> games and lets players search for specific servers running maps or modes they want to play while avoiding the stuff they don’t like. Server browsers can also run specific rules and use moderators to control griefing while developing a community around them.</p>

 <p>Instead, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/battlefield-6-has-a-server-browser-but-there-is-a-catch/1100-6533674/"><em>Battlefield 6</em>‘s server browser</a> will be included in Portal, a part of the game that will operate like Forge in <em>Halo</em> and let players make their own experiences, maps, and game modes. So it sounds like you’ll only be able to access community-created modes and experiences using this server browser and not official EA servers running vanilla maps and games.&nbsp; Alexia Christofi, a producer on <em>BF6</em>, <a href="https://x.com/Lex_mate/status/1951898828669395394">tweeted about the server browser</a> after the reveal event, saying that community-created modes can “award full XP” and confirming that the browser “will be front and center in our main menu, not hidden.” It’ll feature a filter, too. The question is how persistent servers will be and whether more traditional <em>BF</em> experiences will be a part of it, or if folks looking to play conquest have to rely solely on matchmaking. EA says more info is coming soon. Hopefully, that will clear things up.</p> <h2><em>Battlefield 6</em> on PC will require Secure Boot</h2> <p><a href="https://www.ea.com/en/games/battlefield/battlefield-6/news/secure-boot-information">Battlefield Studios has also confirmed that its upcoming military shooter will require Secure Boot on PC</a>. This is a newer way to try and stop cheaters from playing the game and malicious software from booting on your Windows 10 or 11 PC. While Secure Boot can be effective at stopping cheaters and bad actors, it can also cause a lot of headaches for users who have to upgrade older machines to support the feature. It is also prone to failure or causing other PC problems, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/pcgaming/comments/1mhpu0t/secure_boot_is_a_requirement_to_play_battlefield/">something you can spot in Reddit threads</a> with people asking for help getting the open beta launcher to load on their Windows PC.</p>

 <p>“Requiring Secure Boot provides us with features that we can leverage against cheats that attempt to infiltrate during the Windows boot process,” said EA in a blog about requiring the feature. “It also lets the Battlefield Positive Play team use its own features and related dependent security features like TPM to combat other forms of cheating, the most relevant of which include: kernel-level cheats and toolkits, memory manipulation, spoofing, hardware ID manipulation, virtual machines…” and other anti-cheat tools.&nbsp; While that’s all very true, its presence may still be a dealbreaker for some. And the worst part is that cheaters can still bypass Secure Boot. This won’t be a feature on consoles, which are closed systems with tighter platform control.</p> <h2><strong>All the maps that will be available in <em>Battlefield 6</em> at launch</strong></h2> <p>During the big reveal event, EA listed all nine maps that will be available in <em>Battlefield 6</em> when it launches later this year. Here’s the list:</p> <ul> <li>Siege of Cairo</li> <li>Iberian Offensive</li> <li>Liberation Peak</li> <li>Empire State</li> <li>Operation Firestorm</li> <li>Saints Quarter</li> <li>New Sobek City</li> <li>Mirak Valley</li> <li>Manhattan Bridge</li> </ul> <p>And yes, Operation Firestorm is a returning classic from <em>Battlefield 3</em>. EA has confirmed that it will bring back more classic maps in the future based on player feedback and requests. Also, EA confirmed that all modes are playable on all maps, as every level in <em>BF6</em> can scale up or down to better fit the selected mode. So if you play deathmatch on Empire State—a map set in NYC—you’ll play in a smaller section of the map designed for that mode. But if you return to the NYC-based map later and play conquest, you’ll get to explore the whole thing as it will be opened up more for modes that demand more real estate. So in a sense, you really have more than nine maps in <em>BF6</em>. What a deal!</p> <p><strong>When does <em>Battlefield 6</em> launch? How much is it? And what platforms?&nbsp;</strong></p> <p>During last week’s <em>Battlefield 6</em> multiplayer reveal, EA and Battlefield Studios confirmed the launch date for the game, as well price and platforms. <em>Battlefield 6</em> will arrive on October 10. There is no paid early access window. <a href="https://kotaku.com/battlefield-6-price-70-80-ea-preorder-black-ops-7-1851787292">The game will cost $70</a>, though you can buy a fancier version for $100.&nbsp; And <em>BF6</em> will be available on PS5, PS5 Pro, Xbox Series X, Xbox Series S, and PC.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/these-are-the-best-jobs-for-each-bravely-default-hd-character.1263870/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              
              <p><i>Bravely Default HD</i> offers nearly limitless team customization thanks to its take on the iconic <i>Final Fantasy </i>job system. Want to have a Monk who can cast healing magic to back up the party? You can. Need a dedicated tank to take the hits while wielding two shields? No problem. Maybe your Black Mage could use swords and heavy armor, it’s all up to you! And as it turns out, there’s a <i>very </i>subtle layer of customization underneath that robust job system which might influence the way you build your party.</p> <p><i>Bravely Default </i>follows four main characters throughout its runtime: Tiz, Agnes, Ringabel, and Edea. Each has slightly different base stats, which <i>technically </i>makes certain characters fit select jobs better than others. It doesn’t make a huge difference, as a character’s power will be predominantly determined by their job and their equipment. Still, stats are stats, and what is an RPG if not an exercise in taking every advantage to make your damage numbers as big as possible? Below you’ll find a breakdown of what stats each character excels in, and what that means for how you should build them.</p> <h2>Each characters’ base stats in Bravely Default</h2> <p>Both <i>Bravely Default </i>on the 3DS and the HD Remake on Switch 2 appear to follow the same rules when it comes to each characters’ stats. Here is what each character excels at:</p>

 <p><b>Edea</b>: Highest STR and VIT of the party.<br> <b>Ringabel</b>: Highest DEX and AGI of the party, though his stats are well rounded. INT is also high.<br> <b>Agnès</b>: Highest INT and MND of the party.<br> <b>Tiz</b>: Highest HP of the party. Has high STR, VIT, and MND</p> <p>What do we make of this information? Well, let’s do another breakdown:</p> <figure id="attachment_2000614614" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000614614"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000614614">© Square Enix</figcaption></figure> <p><b>1: Edea is a clear candidate for a physical attacker or tank role.<br> </b><b>2: Agnès is your best source of magic damage</b>. She has an edge as a healer too, though I’d personally say the best defense is a good offense.<br> <b>3: Ringabel is your best Thief or Ninja, but he can be a strong magic attacker as well.</b> Ringabel’s naturally high AGI means he’s slightly more likely to attack before your other party members, particularly in the early game.<br> <strong>4: </strong><b>Tiz can be best thought of as a Paladin, even if you don’t need to build him that way</b>. He’s your best healer if Agnes is already spoken for, and your best tank or physical attacker aside from Edea.</p> <p>Tiz only lags behind the party in INT and AGI, making him <i>almost </i>a near mirror image of Ringabel. Which is fitting, as Edea and Agnès are both also opposites in their stat distribution.</p>

 <h2>The best jobs for each character in Bravely Default (through Chapter 1)</h2> <p><b>Take this section with a grain of salt, for reasons we’ll get into below</b>. But if you’re still early enough in the game where these stat differences will be the most noticeable, consider giving each character any of the following jobs:</p> <p><b>Tiz</b>: White Mage, Knight, Merchant, Monk<br> <b>Agnès</b>: Black Mage, White Mage, Time Mage, Thief<br> <b>Ringabel</b>: Thief, Monk, Black Mage, Spell Fencer<br> <b>Edea: </b>Knight, Spell Fencer, Monk, Merchant</p> <figure id="attachment_2000614615" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000614615"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000614615">© Square Enix</figcaption></figure> <p>Caption: A screenshot of <i>Bravely Default </i>for the Nintendo Switch 2. Tiz, Agnès, and Edea are looking at a Black Knight who has boarded their ship.</p>

 <h2>After the opening hours, don’t limit your job choices to each characters’ role</h2> <p>When you’re still getting your feet wet with the game, your future job choices will likely be determined by the jobs a character has already used. For example, if Agnès is your magic attacker, you’ll likely keep her as a caster so she can seamlessly carry over her spell-slinging prowess to whatever job she equips next. A well balanced party will help a lot early on, but the more jobs you unlock, the more you’ll realize just how the game rewards you for thinking out of the box.</p> <p>Does a party of four black mages sound crazy? Maybe, until you realize the job’s innate Black Resonance ability boosts magic damage for every Black Mage in your party, setting yourself up to potentially nuke bosses into the moon in a single brave-boosted turn. Conversely, you might decide to level up everyone as a Knight so they can learn the Two-Handed ability and tear through random encounters. Heck, if a character masters <i>every </i>job, they can become absolute monsters as a lowly Freelancer thanks to the Late Bloomer ability!</p> <p>All of this is to say that there’s a <i>lot </i>to be gained by experimenting with jobs, even the ones that don’t fit a character’s role. And to restate what was said above, most of a characters’ power will come from their build and not their innate stats. Edea won’t be quite as good of a Black Mage as Agnes, but she won’t feel weak if you decide to build her as one either. So please, <i>please </i>experiment with your job choices as you progress, as you may be surprised by the combos you uncover. And considering just <a href="https://kotaku.com/bravely-default-flying-fairy-switch-2-hd-mini-games-1851784559">how long <i>Bravely Default</i> is</a>, you’ll have plenty of time to level up your party before your journey is over.</p> <hr> <p><i>Bravely Default: Flying Fairy HD</i> is available on the Nintendo Switch 2.</p>
                          </div></div><br/><br/>https://kotaku.com/bravely-default-hd-switch-2-best-jobs-tiz-agnes-ringabel-edea-2000614612]]></content:encoded>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/pokemon-company-pikachu-nintendo-america-breasts-design-2000616048</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              
              <p><span>Sometimes you hear about something and realize the trajectory of your life could have completely changed if one thing had happened differently. Or, I guess in this case, two things had happened differently. For years now, there’s been a story circulating online in </span><i><span>Pokémon </span></i><span>spaces about Nintendo of America allegedly asking Game Freak to give Pikachu, the lovable little yellow guy who would go on to become one of the most prominent pop culture mascots of all time, human-like breasts when bringing </span><i><span>Pokémon </span></i><span>over to the west. If that had happened, the world would be different, and I probably wouldn’t have a job here at </span><i><span>Kotaku </span></i><span>because I would have likely never been allowed near </span><i><span>Pokémon </span></i><span>as a child and gone on to become hyperfixated on the rest of nerd culture. This story has </span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/todayilearned/comments/1mbg8nc/til_that_when_pok%C3%A9mon_was_being_localised_for_the/"><span>been disputed</span></a><span> because of what some deemed a questionable translation, but Japanese outlet </span><a href="https://www.gamespark.jp/article/2025/07/29/155531.html"><i><span>Game*Spark</span></i></a><span> went looking and found the original interview and it sounds like, yeah, someone at Nintendo wanted Pikachu to have giant bazongas to appeal to Americans.</span></p> <p><a href="https://automaton-media.com/en/news/nintendo-of-america-really-did-suggest-giving-pikachu-large-feminine-breasts-at-one-point-japanese-media-confirms/"><i><span>Automaton</span></i><span>’s</span></a><span> translation breaks down the findings and the translation disputes. The </span><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20180731153121/https:/www.nintendo.co.jp/nom/0007/taidan1/page03.html"><span>25-year-old interview</span></a><span> with Pokémon Company CEO Tsunekazu Ishihara includes a story about how Nintendo of America thought that Pikachu and company were “too cute” and might need a redesign to appeal to Americans’ edgy sensibilities. Pikachu’s redesign was described as “a tabby cat with huge breasts,” similar to what you might see in the Andrew Lloyd Webber musical </span><i><span>Cats</span></i><span>, but the Japanese word “mune” is used here, which can be used to refer to either pronounced pecs or the presumed mommy milkers, which led to the aforementioned dispute. However, when the interviewer asked if this design was “like those girls who do Pikachu cosplays at anime conventions,” Ishihara said, “Yes, exactly.”&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>Ishihara said that it was an interesting thought experiment and made him appreciate the cultural differences between the Eastern and Western audiences, but he thankfully turned down the design, we got the little yellow guy unchanged, and </span><i><span>Pokémon </span></i><span>still became a cultural phenomenon over here. That’s not to say that monster taming franchises can’t also have sexualized designs and be successful. </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/digmon-story-time-stranger-preview-pokemon-pc-ps5-xbox-1851784677"><i><span>Digimon</span></i></a> <span>has several humanoid monsters like Angemon and Angewomon that appeal to people looking for that, but </span><i><span>Pokémon</span></i><span>’s longevity is tied to how timeless its characters are and how every new generation of kids can jump into it from anywhere. That certainly hasn’t stopped them from creating humanoid Pokémon over the years, but the visual identity of those characters has remained child-appropriate. The franchise already had to weather enough bullshit from people trying to paint it as </span><a href="https://filmschoolrejects.com/pokemon-satanic-panic/"><span>some kind of gateway to evil</span></a><span>. Imagine if it was also having to fight against parents accusing it of trying to corrupt children’s minds with sexual imagery. </span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/todayilearned/comments/70p101/til_that_a_40second_sequence_of_james_showing_off/"><span>Good thing that never happened, right</span></a><span>?</span></p>
