              <p>Amazon keeps its prices low on Alexa-enabled speakers all year long and the <strong>Echo Dot is a great choice because it is in the middle of the lineup</strong> between basic and premium options. This model is the best-selling one in the Echo family <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4514/">right now, and it’s only $31 instead of the usual $49 for early December</a>. The small speaker has surprisingly rich sound that fills bedrooms, offices, or dining rooms without taking up too much counter space or needing a lot of setup.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4514/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Why This Echo Dot Sounds Better Than You Thought</h2>
<p>The speaker design is all about making the sound fuller and giving it more bass than previous Echo Dot models could do with their small enclosures. Amazon changed the way the internal drivers are set up so that they can comfortably fill small to medium-sized rooms with sound while playing music, listening to podcasts, or reading audiobooks. The sound quality isn’t good enough to replace dedicated speakers for critical listening, but it does a good job with background music, news briefings, and alarm sounds, making the Echo Dot useful for more than just voice commands.</p>



<p><strong>Alexa integration lets you control thousands of smart home devices</strong>, streaming services, and information queries with your voice, so you don’t have to keep taking out your phone: You can change smart lights, thermostats, and plugs by speaking commands naturally. You can also check the weather, set multiple timers while you cook, or ask for unit conversions while you prepare a recipe. The microphone array uses far-field voice recognition technology to filter out background noise and make your voice clear even when music is playing at a moderate volume.</p>
<p>The small size is about the size of a tennis ball, so it doesn’t take up much space on nightstands or desk corners where bigger Echo devices would take up too much space. This size is perfect for bedrooms because it wakes you up with music, news, or soft sounds instead of loud beeps. While you’re getting ready, you can ask Alexa for the time, the weather, or your calendar appointments without touching any devices. The <strong>top surface has physical buttons for turning up the volume</strong>, muting the microphone, and turning on Alexa.</p>



<p>Smart home routines let you set up morning routines that gradually brighten the lights, start your coffee maker, and read your calendar. You can do all of these things with just one command or a scheduled trigger. Evening routines can lock smart locks, change the temperature, turn off all the lights in the house, and play relaxing sounds to help you sleep. You set up these automation sequences in the Alexa app, and they work every time after that.</p>
<p><strong>A physical microphone mute button is part of the privacy controls</strong>: When the button is pressed, the microphones are electronically disconnected. A red light ring shows when the device isn’t listening. The speaker also has options to limit how long data is kept or stop people from listening to recordings</p>
<p>This $18 off makes full Alexa functionality and better sound quality affordable enough to buy Echo Dots for more than one room. If you want to start building a smart home or just need hands-free voice control in important areas, this is a great deal because you get Amazon’s smart assistant platform with room-filling sound for less than the cost of basic Bluetooth speakers.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[One Week After Black Friday, Dyson V11 Quietly Hits New Record Low on Amazon]]></title>
            <link>https://kotaku.com/one-week-after-black-friday-dyson-v11-quietly-hits-new-record-low-on-amazon-2000651139</link>

              <p>Black Friday came and went, but Amazon continues pushing deals on premium brands throughout December which happens to be its biggest sales month of the year. The <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4478/">Dyson V11 Origin currently sits at $399 instead of its usual $629 which is a record low on this cordless vacuum</a> that brings serious suction power to your cleaning routine.</p>
<p>This <strong>model delivers 185 air watts of power across three modes</strong>, and handles both quick daily cleanups and deep weekend cleaning sessions. Over 40,000 units sold in the past month as people realize Dyson’s engineering justifies the premium over budget stick vacuums that die after six months. The combination of 60-minute runtime, detangling brush head, and HEPA filtration creates a cleaning tool that handles pet hair, allergens, and debris across all floor types.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4478/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>What 185 Air Watts Does to Change Your Cleaning Experience</h2>
<p>The suction power measured in air watts represents actual cleaning capability rather than motor wattage marketing numbers that don’t correlate with performance. This <strong>V11 Origin pulls 60% more power than previous Dyson V-series models</strong>, and creates enough airflow to lift embedded dirt from carpet fibers and pull debris from grout lines in hard flooring. You can feel the difference immediately when vacuuming high-traffic areas where foot traffic grinds dirt deep into carpet pile, as the motorbar cleaner head actually extracts material that cheaper vacuums just push around.</p>



<p><strong>Three power modes</strong> let you clean in different ways without wasting battery on tasks that don’t need full power. Auto mode automatically changes the suction power based on the type of floor and the amount of dirt, balancing cleaning performance with battery life to make it last for years. Eco mode lets you clean your whole house or a large area <strong>for up to 60 minutes at a time</strong>, which is great for when you need to run the device for a long time between charges. Boost mode gives you the most suction for tough spots, dirt that has been ground in, or thick carpets that need more power. The LCD screen shows how much time is left for cleaning, down to the second, as well as power mode and maintenance alerts. This way, you always know how much time you have left.</p>
<p>The <strong>Motorbar cleaner head has a design that keeps long hair and pet fur from getting stuck</strong> in the brush bar: This fixes one of the most annoying things about owning a vacuum. With traditional brush rolls, you have to cut and unwind hair that builds up while you clean. This design, on the other hand, sends hair straight to the dustbin as you vacuum. You can clean rooms with long-haired people or pets that shed without having to stop every few minutes to untangle hair from the brush.</p>



<p>Advanced<strong> whole-machine HEPA filtration catches 99.99% of particles as small as 0.3 microns</strong> including allergens, dust mites, and fine particulate matter that can cause breathing problems. The sealed filtration system keeps particles that have been caught from getting back into your air through cracks or exhaust. This is very important for people with allergies or respiratory issues.</p>
<p>You can <strong>switch to handheld mode in seconds</strong> by taking off the wand and attaching tools directly to the main body and because of this flexibility, you don’t have to get out a separate handheld vacuum for quick cleanups in the car, on the couch, or on the ceiling. The weight and balance are good for handheld use, so you can use it for a long time on stairs or furniture without getting tired in your arms.</p>
<p>This $230 discount makes Dyson’s engineering and build quality comparable to mid-range cordless vacuums that don’t have the same suction power, runtime, or filtration as this model. You’re getting a cleaning tool that will last for years instead of months, and the materials and construction are worth the extra cost compared to disposable-grade options.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Lenovo Has No Sale on Its Site, Goes Nearly 80% Off on This 32GB/1TB Model Quietly via Amazon]]></title>
            <link>https://kotaku.com/lenovo-has-no-sale-on-its-site-goes-nearly-80-off-on-this-32gb-1tb-model-quietly-via-amazon-2000651129</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Black Friday was weeks ago, but December is still Amazon’s busiest month for sales with new deals coming out every day. This <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6256/">Lenovo V15 G2 laptop is on sale for a record low of $599 instead of its usual price of $2,599</a> and you won’t find any discounts even close to this on Lenovo’s official site. This laptop has <strong>32GB of DDR4 RAM and a 1TB PCIe SSD</strong> which makes it a useful everyday machine that can handle work and entertainment without costing a lot of money.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6256/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Why This Memory Setup Makes a Big Difference</h2>
<p>In the budget laptop market where 8GB is still common and 16GB is a nice upgrade, the 32GB RAM capacity really stands out: This extra memory space lets you keep a lot of browser tabs open at the same time as Office apps, video conferencing software, photo editing tools, and background processes without them slowing down.</p>



<p>The 1TB PCIe SSD has enough space for large document libraries, photo collections, downloaded courses, and application installations without needing external drives or heavy cloud management.<strong> PCIe interface technology makes reading and writing much faster than older SATA SSDs</strong> which means that Windows boots up in seconds and apps start right away when you click on them. This storage capacity matters for students storing lecture recordings and project files, professionals managing client documents and presentations, or families sharing one laptop across multiple users with different needs.</p>
<p>The <strong>Intel Celeron N4500 processor is good enough for everyday computing tasks</strong> and uses little power, which is good for battery life when you’re in class or working away from an outlet. This dual-core chip has a 4MB cache and can boost speeds up to 2.8GHz and it has enough power for web browsing, editing documents, working with spreadsheets, streaming video, and making calls. The processor can’t handle video editing, 3D rendering, or modern gaming beyond simple games, but it can handle regular school and office tasks without too many delays.</p>
<p>The 15.6-inch FHD display at 1920×1080 resolution shows text crisply enough for extended document work without causing eye strain, and the anti-glare coating reduces reflections from overhead lighting or windows. The thin bezels make the most of the screen space in the chassis and gives it a modern look that doesn’t look cheap even though it is. Dolby Audio processing through two speakers makes video calls sound clear and YouTube and Netflix sound good enough.</p>



<p>Wi-Fi 6 support makes wireless connections faster and works better in networks that are crowded with a lot of devices trying to use the same bandwidth at the same time. This new standard makes it easier for multiple people to stream content, play games, and make video calls at the same time in dorms, offices, or homes. Bluetooth 5.2 works better with wireless devices like mice, keyboards, and headphones than older Bluetooth versions as it has a longer range and more stable connections. The selection of connections meets real-world needs with <strong>USB-A ports for older devices, USB-C ports for newer accessories, HDMI ports for external monitors</strong> or projectors, and an ethernet jack for wired connections when Wi-Fi isn’t available or reliable.</p>
<p>This huge discount off the normal listing price makes a well-configured laptop with lots of RAM and storage affordable while still keeping specs that would normally cost $800–900 elsewhere. You’re getting twice as much memory and storage as most other budget laptops, and the machine’s useful life will be longer than that of cheaper options because it has modern connectivity standards.</p>
