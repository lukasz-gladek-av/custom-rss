There’s no threat to Xbox users, but it’s not immediately clear what fixes can be made to the underlying game to completely patch out the issues on PC. </p><p>“The concern in this particular case is that this means an attacker is capable of deploying information stealer malware, a RAT (remote administration tool), or ransomware,” smelly wrote. “Thankfully, it appears this attacker is primarily interested in memeing and fucking with people.”</p><p>Why aren’t Steam players affected? “The game publisher took down only the Microsoft Store and Game Pass version of Call of Duty: WWII because they were different versions of the game than listed on Steam and contained an old flaw that had been patched on other versions of the game, according to two sources with knowledge of the situation,” <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://techcrunch.com/2025/07/08/activision-took-down-call-of-duty-game-after-pc-players-hacked-says-source/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://techcrunch.com/2025/07/08/activision-took-down-call-of-duty-game-after-pc-players-hacked-says-source/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>Tech Crunch</em> reports</a></span>, based on a source from Activision. </p><p>The publisher has yet to comment on the issues. <em>Kotaku </em>reached out yesterday and still hasn’t received a response. </p><p>.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://kotaku.com/call-duty-ww2-hack-rce-exploit-game-pass-pc-offline-1851785883]]></content:encoded>

The devs confirmed the sci-fi shooter “will fully utilize DualSense controller features, including haptic feedback and adaptive triggers for deeper player immersion,” on Sony’s platform. A PS5 Pro update is also in the works, though it’s unclear if that will be ready in time for the PS5 launch. </p><p>  <em>Stalker 2</em> earned fresh fans and won over older ones with its dedication to plunking players down in a mysterious and hostile environment where every bullet and health pack is precious and the mere act of seeing what’s down a road requires a minor act of in-game courage. It does not pander or hand-hold, and with more time spent and less jank (and an earlier release date) it might have entered more GOTY-contender conversations. </p><p>Unfortunately, the bugs at launch on PC and Xbox Series X/S were hard to completely ignore, even if they were entirely par for the course with a complex sandbox game and in keeping with <em>Stalke</em>r’s messy history. While there have been a healthy number of updates and patches in the months since its release, some players have lost patience, and<em> Stalker 2</em>'s ratings on both Steam and Xbox have only gotten spottier. “I’ve been defending <em>Stalker 2</em> since release, but I feel like I am starting to give up a bit,”<span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/stalker/comments/1l95ryh/ive_been_defending_stalker_2_since_release_but_i/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/stalker/comments/1l95ryh/ive_been_defending_stalker_2_since_release_but_i/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"> wrote one fan</a></span> on the subreddit last month in a thread explaining their frustrations.</p><p>I imagine porting the game to another set of hardware will only complicate things further. Otherwise, the PS5 debut is the perfect opportunity for GSC Game World to show everyone what they’ve been missing. <br></p><p>.</p></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://kotaku.com/stalker-2-ps5-pro-patch-bugs-xbox-release-date-1851785879]]></content:encoded>
