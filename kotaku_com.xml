              <p><span>Google has just started rolling out access to its new “experimental research prototype” Project Genie, an AI tool powered by Genie 3 and Gemini that allows users to create interactive, explorable worlds with a simple text prompt. Unsurprisingly, someone has immediately used it to generate a bunch of playable Nintendo knock-offs, including a </span><i><span>The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild </span></i><span>clone, complete with a usable paraglider. I’m sure that the famously non-litigious Nintendo will be absolutely chill about this.</span></p> <p><span>This news comes by way of </span><a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/869726/google-ai-project-genie-3-world-model-hands-on?view_token=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiJ9.eyJpZCI6ImZCakl0bmxFNGwiLCJwIjoiL25ld3MvODY5NzI2L2dvb2dsZS1haS1wcm9qZWN0LWdlbmllLTMtd29ybGQtbW9kZWwtaGFuZHMtb24iLCJleHAiOjE3NzAxNDAwNTYsImlhdCI6MTc2OTcwODA1OH0.q5OBTD_V36-65oc1EGqPxKYCZF00c7ODvifvagVcwbA&amp;utm_medium=gift-link"><i><span>The Verge’s</span></i></a><span> Jay Peters, who was granted access to Google’s Project Genie tool early, ahead of its official release for Google AI Ultra subscribers in the United States earlier this afternoon. Peters was able to craft playable reproductions of several famous Nintendo titles, including </span><i><span>Super Mario 64</span></i><span> and the aforementioned </span><i><span>The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild</span></i><span>, as well as generating some odd amalgamation of </span><i><span>Metroid Prime 3</span></i><span> and </span><i><span>Metroid Prime 4</span></i><span>.</span></p>    <p><span>While it might not be immediately apparent in the videos that Peters provided, these Project Genie AI-generations are partially interactive, allowing users to move, jump, and, in the case of that </span><i><span>Breath of the Wild</span></i><span> one, even paraglide. For the time being, the worlds that it generates are limited to minute-long, 24fps, 720p showcases.</span></p>

 <p><span>So, how is this legal? The short answer is that it isn’t, and Project Genie knows it isn’t.</span></p> <p><span>At one point during his testing, Project Genie stopped Peters from making any further </span><i><span>Super Mario 64</span></i><span> reproductions, out of concern for the “interests of third-party content providers.”</span></p> <p><span>He also came dangerously close to generating a playable version of </span><i><span>Kingdom Hearts</span></i><span>. Project Genie generated an AI-generated mock-up featuring Donald Duck, Sora, Cloud, and Jack Skellington before the process was cut off at the world generation stage. I would have absolutely loved to have seen the resulting AI platform vs. AI platform legal battle that may have spawned out of that, considering </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/disney-open-ai-sora-deal-star-wars-frozen-2000652583"><span>Disney signed a $1 billion deal</span></a><span> to license its characters to OpenAI’s genAI platform.</span></p>

            <guid>1420228</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/fallout-season-2-finally-fixing-dumb-midnight-release-time-2000663241">The second season of Amazon’s <em>Fallout</em> TV</a> show has prominently featured New Vegas, a location first seen in Obsidian’s spin-off open-world RPG <em>Fallout: New Vegas</em> over 15 years ago. That’s led to a lot of <em>Fallout</em> fans and newcomers alike wanting to play or replay what many consider to be the best game in the franchise. But in 2026, you have a few different ways to play <em>New Vegas,</em> and not all of them are great. So here’s the best way to play <em>Fallout: New Vegas</em>, along with some other options that might also work depending on your situation.</p> <h2>The Best Way To Play <em>Fallout: New Vegas</em></h2> <p>There is a simple answer to the best way to play <em>Fallout: New Vega</em>s, but the answer itself isn’t what I would call simple or easy. The best way to play this classic RPG is on PC and with a ton of mods. Thankfully, there’s a very handy guide out there that I used recently to turn <em>New Vegas’</em>s somewhat messy PC port into a fine-tuned experience: <a href="https://vivanewvegas.moddinglinked.com/index.html">The Viva New Vegas comprehensive mod guide</a>.</p>

 <p>Something I really love about the Viva New Vegas guide is that it doesn’t aim to change<em> New Vegas</em> into some super-realistic version of the game that barely looks or plays like the original. Instead, the guide walks you through everything you’ll need to do (and there are plenty of steps to follow…) to get New Vegas running soundly on a modern PC. So no more random crashes or bad performance issues. It’s wonderful. <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/SteamDeck/comments/1q8l6pb/viva_new_vegas_for_fallout_new_vegas_via/">This guide can also work for Steam Deck, too.</a></p> <figure id="attachment_2000664218" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000664218"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000664218">©VNV / Bethesda / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p>The other reason I love this guide is that it offers more mods and options for those who want more features in <em>Fallout: New Vegas</em>. Want to add more NPCs? Or a sprint button? Or improved textures that match the vibes of the original game, but make things look a little sharper on a high-resolution monitor? The Viva New Vegas mod guide will offer you all of that and more. Best of all, the guide will help you pick and choose the bits you want and let you skip stuff that doesn’t sound like your jam.</p>

 <p>At this point, I’m not sure I can go back to playing <em>New Vegas</em> on any other platform or without many of the smart quality-of-life mods and tweaks this guide adds to Obsidian’s <em>Fallout</em> spin-off. But perhaps you don’t have the patience to spend around an hour or two modding <em>New Vegas</em> on your PC. Or maybe you don’t own a gaming PC. Well, this next section is for you!</p>

 <h2>How To Play <em>Fallout: New Vega</em>s On Xbox</h2> <p><em>Fallout: New Vegas</em> was released on Xbox 360 and PS3 alongside PC back in 2010. Those versions of the game can be hard to go back to on original hardware. Trust me on that. But thankfully, Xbox owners don’t have to play <em>New Vegas</em> on Xbox 360. The open-world RPG is one of many Xbox 360 games that support FPS Boost on Series X/S. And it works like a treat. All you need to do is own<em> New Vegas o</em>n Xbox, install it, and turn on FPS Boost in the game’s Xbox compatibility settings. And that’s it. No guide needed.</p> <p>Now, when you boot up <em>New Vegas</em>, <a href="https://youtu.be/-lW2NfxrRkI">you’ll get to play the classic RPG at 60 FPS</a>. And it’s a pretty stable, if not perfect, experience. It is a lot better than how the game ran on PS3 and 360 back in the day. Of course, this version of the game doesn’t include any extra mods or tweaks, and it runs at 720p, which isn’t ideal. But if you don’t mind the fuzzier visuals or perhaps prefer a more authentic presentation, <em>Fallout</em>: <em>New Vegas</em> on Series X/S is a damn fine way to play one of the best <em>Fallout</em> games ever made.</p>

 <h2>The Worst Ways To Play <em>Fallout: New Vegas</em></h2> <p>If you want to play <em>Fallout: New Vegas</em> on a PlayStation 5, I have bad news: It ain’t great. The game, like all PS3 games, doesn’t support native playback on the PS5, so you have to stream it from the cloud. Bleh. It’s playable, assuming you have a good internet connection, but it lacks the 60 FPS boost of the Xbox port or any of the mod options of the PC version. Not helping matters is that the <a href="https://youtu.be/smc_UGrDe98">PS3 ports of Bethesda games back then were rough</a>, often featuring extra bugs and performance issues not present on Xbox 360. <a href="https://kotaku.com/fallout-new-vegas-ps5-ps3-ps-plus-cloud-streaming-2000663815">Oh, and depending on when you read this, you might literally be unable to stream New Vegas on PS5 at al</a>l.</p> <p>If you really, really want to play <em>Fallout: New Vegas</em>, but don’t want to mod it, don’t own an Xbox, and hate the idea of playing the PS3 port of the game, then you could play it via Amazon’s Luna streaming service. I’ve tried this out, and it runs better than the PlayStation 3 version and supports mouse and keyboard. But without any mods, <em>New Vegas</em> can be a bit of a mess. Still, if your options are limited to <a href="https://kotaku.com/fallout-3-new-vegas-play-free-amazon-prime-luna-cloud-1851403763">streaming <em>New Vegas </em>on Luna or PS5</a>, I’d go with Luna every day of the week.</p>

              <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/highguard-impressions-titanfall-2-apex-multiplayer-shooter-2000663136"><em>Highguard</em> players</a> were aghast that the raid hero shooter launched without an FOV slider on console. Well, now it has one, and some other small fixes to help with its launch week woes.</p> <p>“We’ve just pushed out a patch with a number of improvements, including FoV sliders for consoles, toggle options for ADS and Crouch, many video settings, and more,” reads the <a href="https://x.com/PlayHighguard/status/2016938033938108505">1.0.4 update</a> from Wildlight Entertainment. “The team is also working on optimization improvements, they just need a few more days to cook.”</p> <p>Players on PS5 and Xbox Series X/S can now adjust the field-of-view to 110, while a number of new visual settings help PC players limit rendering load to improve framerate. You can’t yet disable motion blur and depth of field but that’s coming down the road. A gnarly bug on PS5 that was crashing the game after leaving matches has also been addressed.</p>

 <p>The first round of many promised improvements comes as <em>Highguard</em> struggles to hang on to its slice of multiplayer mindshare after coming to PC and console earlier this week. An avalanche of <a href="https://kotaku.com/highguard-already-has-over-7000-negative-reviews-on-steam-2000663220">negative reviews on Steam</a> and the <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/4128260/charts/">collapse of the concurrent player numbers on PC</a> aren’t promising, but I’ve also heard anecdotally from friends on console that they’ve been enjoying it more as they continue playing and come to understand the nuances of the genre mashup.</p> <p>Here are the full <em>Highguard</em> 1.0.4 Patch Notes:</p> <blockquote>  <div data-block="true" data-editor="83hv9" data-offset-key="fvds1-0-0"> <p><span data-offset-key="fvds1-0-0">Note: in an effort to release these changes to our players as quickly as possible, a number of menu options are not yet localized in languages other than English.
