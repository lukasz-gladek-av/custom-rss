You’ve got some work to do if you’re looking to get your system exactly the way you want it out of the box. But we have come to you from the other side of the chaos with a few things you should know before the Switching hour. </p><h2 id="h293573"><a id="1"></a>Make the system remember you</h2><p>Probably not a surprise that you’re gonna be signing into your Nintendo Account a LOT during the initial setup. But while the sign in screen conveniently gives you a QR code so you can sign in on your phone instead of doing the on-screen keyboard cabaret, it’s easy to ignore <strong>the fact that the Switch 2 screen has a little button onscreen to remember you</strong>. That button is not hit by default, so while you’re working on signing in, you might just guarantee that you’re gonna see this screen again in the very near future (it’ll come up again when you sign into the eShop for the first time, but that’s about it). Save yourself some annoyance, click that button on the Switch before you go to your phone.</p><h2 id="h293574"><a id="2"></a>Do System Transfer before anything else</h2><p>It’s tempting to want to just slap the thing on your dock and get started as soon as possible. If this is, somehow, your first Switch, knock yourself out. But <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/nintendo-switch-2-system-transfer-cloud-local-initial-1851784644?rev=1750174943328&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/nintendo-switch-2-system-transfer-cloud-local-initial-1851784644?rev=1750174943328">if you’re planning on transferring data from your old Switch</a></span> to the new one, pump your brakes a sec. </p><p><strong>Read More:</strong> <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/nintendo-switch-2-system-transfer-cloud-local-initial-1851784644?rev=1750174943328&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/nintendo-switch-2-system-transfer-cloud-local-initial-1851784644?rev=1750174943328">The Nintendo Switch 2’s System Transfer Is Great If You Do It Correctly</a></span></p><p>The transfer process will throw up a message to connect the Switch to an AC adapter before starting. And they’re not asking, they’re telling. The popup will happen again and the process literally won’t be able to start until the Switch determines there’s enough power flowing into it. </p><p>For us homebodies that prefer to do their Switchery on TV instead of handheld, that’s fine for the system you’ve got docked. But then <strong>you’ll have to have your original Switch doing the same thing in its transfer menu, and it needs to be in close proximity of the Switch 2. </strong>Furthermore, whatever the Switch 2's power demands are, 2 plain old USB-C chargers won’t do the job, either. It’s recommended to use the charger that came with the Switch 2 itself, i.e., the one you fucked up and plugged into your dock. If you’re a super fancy dual-handheld household, I personally managed to skate past it using my Steam Deck’s charger, but not everybody’s got that option. Once that’s done, though,<strong> both systems must remain in close proximity for the actual data transfer</strong>, which thankfully only took about 5 minutes. Basically, don’t go docking until that’s done.</p><p>Oh, by the way, the Switch 2's kinda like an iPhone, <strong>you’ll only get the option to transfer your old data during the initial setup process</strong>. If you go to the main menu, you’ll have to factory reset the Switch 2 to do the transfer later.</p><h2 id="h293575"><a id="3"></a>Can’t use System Transfer? Use Nintendo’s website instead</h2><figure id="" data-id="7ac4a57476ef884916b3f569b41c6907" data-recommend-id="image://7ac4a57476ef884916b3f569b41c6907" data-format="png" data-width="692" data-height="381" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A screenshot shows the user's original Switch.

" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>On the flipside, if you want access to your old stuff but don’t have access to your original Switch, you can at least do so from Nintendo’s site. Logic and common sense dictates that if you buy a game from a digital storefront, the game is tied to your account, and as long as you sign into your account, they’ll follow you anywhere. Nintendo, however, is not a logical company. <strong>As it turns out, while games will show up on your account, they’re actually tied to a specific console. System Transfer takes care of linking the games to your Switch 2 for you, but if that’s not an option, there is an alternative.</strong></p><p>Go to <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;http://accounts.nintendo.com&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="http://accounts.nintendo.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">accounts.nintendo.com</a></span>, and you’ll see a section for Game Systems. Click that, then select your original Switch. You’ll see a bar marked “Loadable”. Click that and unlink that system. Now, whenever you go to download anything from your library, it’ll link it to the new system.</p></div><h2 id="h293576"><a id="4"></a>You can have 4k or 120hz; you can’t have both</h2><figure id="" data-id="7e16c7b826b32a7d33f8839eac4564fc" data-recommend-id="image://7e16c7b826b32a7d33f8839eac4564fc" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A screenshot shows display options for the Switch 2." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A screenshot shows display options for the Switch 2." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Nintendo / Justin Clark / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="7e16c7b826b32a7d33f8839eac4564fc" data-recommend-id="image://7e16c7b826b32a7d33f8839eac4564fc" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A screenshot shows display options for the Switch 2." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Those lucky folks with fancier 4K TVs might’ve gotten excited to find out the new Switch supports 4K and 120hz modes, and then been dumbfounded when the Display Options only showed 60fps. Before you start the wailing and gnashing of teeth in Ultra HD, let’s clear up the mystery: The Switch can only do 120fps in 1080p and 1440p, while 4K is limited to 60.</p><p><strong>Read More:</strong> <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/nintendo-switch-2-welcome-tour-worth-it-how-long-beat-1851784828&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/nintendo-switch-2-welcome-tour-worth-it-how-long-beat-1851784828">Just How Long Is <em>Nintendo Switch 2</em> <em>Welcome Tour</em>?</a></span></p><div><p>The “good” news is that as of launch, the only game with anything that even supports 120fps is <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/nintendo-switch-2-welcome-tour-worth-it-how-long-beat-1851784828&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/nintendo-switch-2-welcome-tour-worth-it-how-long-beat-1851784828">a minigame in <em>Welcome Tour</em></a></span>, while the only 100% confirmed game in the future that will support it is <em>Metroid Prime 4</em>. Yes, there was a rumor <em>Mario Kart World</em> might have it, but no dice on that one. Basically, though, you’re not missing anything, really. </p><p>Oh and also, the same goes for VRR, which is only supported in handheld mode.</p></div><h2 id="h293577"><a id="5"></a>Turn on Auto Uploads for the Switch Online App</h2><figure id="" data-id="fd2f8354521baf2b7f79b486cf03a2e7" data-recommend-id="image://fd2f8354521baf2b7f79b486cf03a2e7" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A screenshot shows the Switch 2's upload settings." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A screenshot shows the Switch 2's upload settings." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Nintendo / Justin Clark / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="fd2f8354521baf2b7f79b486cf03a2e7" data-recommend-id="image://fd2f8354521baf2b7f79b486cf03a2e7" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A screenshot shows the Switch 2's upload settings." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Good news! The Switch Online app is actually extremely useful with the Switch 2, and not just for the most convoluted voice chat ever. One of the big improvements is that Nintendo’s joined the rest of the pack this console generation and included a feature where screenshots get uploaded to a centralized location to be accessed off of your system. Excellent news, but they also kinda bury the lede that you need to actually turn that feature on from the Switch 2 to make it happen. The option’s in the Upload Settings menu in the Album app. </p><h2 id="h293578"><a id="6"></a>Clearing up the controller conundrum</h2><figure id="" data-id="45f6d5f9c4c07fd7f09e0d22786d5a4e" data-recommend-id="image://45f6d5f9c4c07fd7f09e0d22786d5a4e" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A screenshot shows controller options on the Switch 2." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A screenshot shows controller options on the Switch 2." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Nintendo / Justin Clark / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="45f6d5f9c4c07fd7f09e0d22786d5a4e" data-recommend-id="image://45f6d5f9c4c07fd7f09e0d22786d5a4e" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A screenshot shows controller options on the Switch 2." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Given how many different control configurations there are for the original Switch, adding a brand new set of options into the mix hasn’t made staying sane any easier for folks with a half dozen Joy-Cons running around. But, again, simplicity is a virtue here. The no-bullshit rundown is this: </p><ul data-type="List" data-style="Bullet"><li>Currently, the only things you can physically attach to the sides of the Switch 2 are the new Joy-Cons. </li><li>The original Switch’s Joy-Cons and the Pro controller can be paired with the Switch 2 wirelessly.</li><li>The Pro controller can also be used wired via USB/USB-C, but you’ll need to enable a setting for it to work (it’s in System Settings &gt; Controllers &amp; Accessories &gt; Nintendo Switch Pro Controller Wired Communication)</li><li>Third party controllers are a case-by-case basis. Some publishers have been issuing firmware updates to allow their equipment to work, however. Check their official site first if you’re not sure. </li><li>Lastly, it’s a tiny thing, but, sadly, no, you can’t turn on the Switch 2/your TV using the Switch 1's Pro controller. Bummer.</li></ul><hr><p>The Switch 2 might have a couple of quirks you’ll have to sort through before you can jump straight into <em>Mario Kart World</em> or another game of your choice. Hopefully this guide will have demystified the process for you so you’re not wasting any more time menu-diving.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Two great examples of this are Smart Steering and Auto-Accelerate. No worries if you’re unable to figure it out, because we’re going to make it simple!</p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="196165" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="What’s Coming Out Beyond Pokémon: The Indigo Disk | The Week In Games" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="95" data-playlist="196165,196646,196452" data-current="196165"><div><p>What’s Coming Out Beyond Pokémon: The Indigo Disk | The Week In Games</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196165/196165_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196165/196165_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196165/196165_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196165/196165_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/21711.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><h2 id="h1101439"><a id=""></a>What is Smart Steering?</h2><p>While you’re picking a kart or after pausing gameplay, you’re able to access the Settings/Controller menu. The first toggle you’ll see is for Smart Steering. Those who played the previous entry likely remember what this means. Anyone who’s jumping into the <em>Mario Kart</em> series for the first time or in a long while is out of luck, since there isn’t any explanation as to what this does.</p><p><strong>Smart Steering is an assistant feature that’s meant to keep you from driving off the edge of a course.</strong> You’ll find yourself being tugged back along the track whenever you get too close to an edge or wall. Visually, it’s represented by a small antenna on the back of your kart that lights up when the feature is activated.</p><figure id="" data-id="ad8fb29dab13132f2b916460b32076e9" data-recommend-id="image://ad8fb29dab13132f2b916460b32076e9" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The Settings/Controller menu, highlighting the Smart Steering option." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="The Settings/Controller menu, highlighting the Smart Steering option." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Nintendo / Samuel Moreno / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="ad8fb29dab13132f2b916460b32076e9" data-recommend-id="image://ad8fb29dab13132f2b916460b32076e9" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The Settings/Controller menu, highlighting the Smart Steering option." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Newer and younger players alike are sure to enjoy Smart Steering’s assistance. However, <strong>enabling this does come with caveats. The obvious setback is that you’ll be unable to perform up to the second level of your mini-turbo</strong>. Not having access to the third and strongest drift boost is a huge detriment when playing online or even in 150cc. Just as challenging is that Smart Steering’s corrections can ruin some of your drifts and make it difficult to take off-road shortcuts. I’ve also experienced a bit of awkwardness when <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/mario-kart-world-rail-wall-charge-jump-ride-switch-2-1851784648&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/mario-kart-world-rail-wall-charge-jump-ride-switch-2-1851784648">trying to Rail Ride</a></span>. As helpful as this feature is, you might enjoy playing without it once you’ve become more familiar with <em>Mario Kart World</em>.</p><h2 id="h1101440"><a id=""></a>What is Auto-Accelerate?</h2><p>Directly underneath the Smart Steering option is Auto-Accelerate. This one might be easier to guess, but it’s still pretty vague without a proper definition. <strong>Auto-Accelerate is an assistant feature that constantly keeps the Accelerate input triggered.</strong> Considering that you’re likely pressing down on the A button 99% of the time anyway, this probably sounds like a dream for accessibility reasons or even if you find your thumb getting sore.</p><p>I’d argue this feature is much more of a convenience option that you could use for as long as you play. That being said, it’s not without some problems. <strong>Continuously accelerating means you can’t brake as effectively or go in reverse</strong>. These are minor issues that can be mitigated with experience over time, but they’re still worth taking into account.</p><p>The best part with either of these features is that they can be toggled with a quick visit to the Options menu. Go ahead and experiment whenever you want to make adjustments to your driving ability!</p><p>.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Well, the launch frenzy has made Final Fantasy one of the hardest sets to actually participate in as a fan, just as its popularity hits new heights.

While reprints are expected as soon as July, and should continue for a while given the<em> Final Fantasy</em> expansion is part of MTG’s standard set of cards (and thus legal in all tournament play), the difficulty of not only finding cards at the moment, but actually being able to afford them, has been a bit of a buzzkill. </p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

In between fusing demons and fighting you can easily pile on the hours throughout the game.

So be prepared to spend a lot of time fusing all of the demons!</p><p>There are also two new difficulty modes.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://kotaku.com/nintendo-switch-2-welcome-tour-worth-it-how-long-beat-1851784828<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Nintendo has a history of packing in tutorial games with some of their hardware, so players were reasonably frustrated to find that <em>Nintendo Switch 2 Welcome Tour</em> would run them $10. But while this tutorial-focused title should’ve probably just been included with the Nintendo Switch 2, it may still be worth buying for certain folks who will benefit from learning more about their new system. </p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="197565" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="Nintendo Switch 2 Could Launch With Almost No Reviews" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="122" data-playlist="197565,197567,195670" data-current="197565"><div><p>Nintendo Switch 2 Could Launch With Almost No Reviews</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197565/197565_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197565/197565_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197565/197565_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/23089.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>Whether you’re a long-time gamer or new to the hobby, you’re probably curious about how long <em>Nintendo Switch 2 Welcome Tour</em> will take to beat and whether it’s even worth that price tag. Let’s take a look.</p><h2 id="h342757"><a id=""></a>How long is <em>Nintendo Switch 2 Welcome Tour</em>, and is it worth buying?</h2><p>Alright, let’s get real for a second. Much of <em>Nintendo Switch 2 Welcome Tour</em> is just reading and following prompts or engaging in simplistic mini-games, so it’s more of an interactive exhibit than a game you “beat.” But if your goal is to check off plenty of tutorial segments and get some of the medals in the mini-games, <strong>you’ll be able to squeeze a few hours of fun out of this strange little game</strong>.</p><p>For the $10 price tag, <em>Nintendo Switch 2 Welcome Tour</em> provides a pretty solid look at all of the Nintendo Switch 2's unique features. There’s a whole lot of useful stuff you can learn here, and it’s delivered in a bright and colorful package that certainly feels very “Nintendo” in design. But at the end of the day, it’s a glorified tutorial, meaning that its worth will be largely determined by whether you feel like you need help learning how everything works.</p><p>With this in mind, gaming enthusiasts who likely knew how every feature works on the Switch 2 before they even got their hands on one aren’t likely to benefit greatly from the information in <em>Nintendo Switch 2 Welcome Tour</em>—though it’s worth noting that some of the mini-games can be fun. Younger or less experienced players may enjoy learning how to make the most of their new hardware, especially things like Joy-Con functionality and attachment, or even general safety.</p><p>We don’t want kids trying to eat the Joy-Cons, after all. They taste terrible anyway. Or so I hear. I wouldn’t know, of course. Can we move on?</p><p>Anyway, the bottom line is that <em>Nintendo Switch 2 Welcome Tour</em> would have made a great pack-in title, but it still may be worth the $10 for particular demographics. So, just make your decision based on your gaming experience and whether you enjoy quirky mini-games. As for me, I think I’ll be ripping some <em>Mario Kart World</em> instead.</p><p>If <em>Nintendo Switch 2 Welcome Tour</em> sounds like a worthwhile purchase for you, it’s available now exclusively for, well, Nintendo Switch 2. It’s literally in the name. Don’t be weird.</p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
