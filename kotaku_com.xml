            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5851/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

            <title><![CDATA[Amazon Fire TV Soundbar Plus Hits New Record Low After Two Price Cuts in One Week (Newest Model With Built-in Subwoofer, 3.1 Channel, Dolby Atmos)]]></title>
            <link>https://kotaku.com/amazon-fire-tv-soundbar-plus-hits-new-record-low-after-two-price-cuts-in-one-week-newest-model-with-built-in-subwoofer-3-1-channel-dolby-atmos-2000658522</link>
            <guid>1403263</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div dir="auto" data-message-author-role="assistant" data-message-id="120afa3f-762d-4d99-b75c-184290b96084" data-message-model-slug="gpt-5-2">
<p data-start="0" data-end="488">If you’ve ever splurged on a new TV only to feel underwhelmed once you hit play, the problem probably isn’t the picture—it’s the sound. Modern televisions are thinner than ever, and while that sleek design looks great on the wall, it leaves very little room for quality speakers. As a result, dialogue can sound flat, action scenes lack punch, and music loses its emotional impact. The good news is that dramatically improving your home entertainment audio doesn’t have to cost a fortune.</p>
<p data-start="490" data-end="768"><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4053/">Right now, Amazon’s Fire TV Soundbar Plus is discounted by 30%, bringing the price down from its usual $250 to just $175.</a> For anyone looking to elevate their viewing experience without diving into an expensive, complicated surround sound setup, this deal is well worth a closer look.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4053/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2 data-start="770" data-end="816">Why a Soundbar Makes Such a Big Difference</h2>
<p data-start="818" data-end="1209">Audio accounts for a huge portion of how we experience movies, sports, and TV shows. Crisp dialogue helps you follow the story, while powerful bass and immersive effects pull you into the action. Relying on your TV’s built-in speakers means missing out on much of what creators intended you to hear. A soundbar is one of the simplest and most cost-effective ways to fix that problem.</p>
<p data-start="1211" data-end="1493">The Fire TV Soundbar features a 3.1 channel configuration with a built-in subwoofer, delivering noticeably richer and deeper bass than standard TV speakers. Explosions feel more impactful, crowd noise during sports broadcasts sounds more realistic, and music gains warmth and depth.</p>
<p data-start="1495" data-end="1787">It’s worth it alone for the dedicated center channel, which focuses specifically on dialogue. This means voices are clearer and more distinct, even during busy or loud scenes. You can finally stop riding the volume button or turning on subtitles just to understand what characters are saying.</p>
<h2 data-start="1789" data-end="1839">Designed for Small Spaces, Built for Big Sound</h2>
<p data-start="1841" data-end="2165">Not everyone has room for a full home theater system, and that’s where this soundbar really shines. Measuring just 37 inches wide, it’s compact enough to fit comfortably in apartments, bedrooms, dorm rooms, or smaller living rooms. You can place it neatly on a TV stand or mount it on the wall for a clean, minimalist setup.</p>
<p data-start="2167" data-end="2522">Despite its modest size, the soundbar delivers an expansive audio experience thanks to DTS Virtual:X technology. This feature creates the illusion of surround sound, making audio feel like it’s coming from all around you—even without rear speakers. Dolby Atmos support further enhances compatible content, adding clarity and dimension to movies and shows.</p>


<h2 data-start="2524" data-end="2563">Easy Setup and Everyday Versatility</h2>
<p data-start="2565" data-end="2784">The Fire TV Soundbar is designed to be plug-and-play. Simply connect it to your TV using HDMI ARC, and your TV should automatically route audio through the soundbar. No complicated menus or technical expertise required.</p>
<p data-start="2786" data-end="3024">Beyond TV viewing, the soundbar also doubles as a wireless speaker. With Bluetooth and USB connectivity, you can stream music, podcasts, or audiobooks directly from your phone or other devices, making it a versatile addition to your home.</p>
<p data-start="3026" data-end="3233">If you already use a Fire TV smart TV or Fire TV streaming device, integration is seamless. You can control both your TV and the soundbar with a single Fire TV remote, keeping things simple and clutter-free.</p>
<p data-start="3273" data-end="3681" data-is-last-node="" data-is-only-node="">For $175, the Fire TV Soundbar offers a noticeable upgrade over built-in TV speakers, combining clear dialogue, enhanced bass, and immersive sound in a compact, affordable package. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4053/">With its current 30% discount, it’s an ideal opportunity to transform your home viewing experience without overspending</a>. If you’re ready to leave tinny TV audio behind, this soundbar is an easy and budget-friendly step forward.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Apple MacBook Air (2025 13-inch, M4) Drops to Its Lowest Price Ever in a New Year Laptop Clearance]]></title>
            <link>https://kotaku.com/apple-macbook-air-2025-13-inch-m4-hits-its-lowest-price-ever-in-a-new-year-laptop-clearance-2000658785</link>
            <guid>1403242</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>You gotta love it when an elite-level laptop processor takes a serious price dive because a new version hits the market. That’s what’s happened with Apple’s M4-powered laptops since the M5 chip dropped last October, and while the M5 models are truly incredible, the M4s still pack a powerful punch, and <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6716/">you can score a 13-inch 2025 M4 MacBook Air for just $799 at Amazon right now</a>.</p>
<p>Apple’s most recent features and innovations are all packed into the M4 MacBook Air, from Apple Intelligence AI, an 18-hour battery life, and some of the absolute best visuals and sound of any laptop. The M4 MacBooks are a great opportunity for creative pros, Apple fans, and anyone wanting to score a truly great laptop that’s marked down by hundreds of dollars from its original price.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6716/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Still Fresh</h2>
<p>Apple’s rapid upgrade schedule from the M2 chip to the M5 — a trek that took only two years — means that the “previous model” MacBooks are actually very,&nbsp;<em>very</em> recent. This 13-inch M4 MacBook Air is less than a year old, which means you won’t have to worry about OS compatibility or falling behind on the latest Apple goodies for years to come, most likely. Since the jump from the M4 to the M5 is a 20% gain in CPU speed and quicker Apple Intelligence, you might not notice the performance difference at all, but you’ll definitely notice the $200 that’s staying in your wallet when you go with the M4 MacBook Air.</p>
<p>The first thing you’ll notice when you fire up the M4 MacBook Air is, of course, Apple’s legendary Liquid Retina display. A billion colors are packed into the 13.6-inch screen to make any picture or static image truly pop, and with a great refresh rate, your videos and streaming will be absolutely peak. The MacBook Air’s 12MP Center Stage camera combines with three built-in mics and four speakers with Spatial Audio to create a perfect multimedia machine for video calls.</p>



<h2>All-Day Intelligence</h2>
<p>Once you dig into the latest iteration of Apple Intelligence, you’ll want to play with it all day. Apple’s AI model is a true boon to anyone needing a hand with writing, creating, research, or anything else you ask of it. Apple’s built market-best privacy protection features into Apple Intelligence, making your searches and activity so secure that even Apple can’t see them. You can indulge in that all-day dive into Apple Intelligence with the 13-inch M4 MacBook Air, because it comes with a robust 18-hour battery life.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6716/">The 20%-off Amazon deal that cuts the price of the 13-inch 2025 M4 MacBook Air by a full $200</a>, down to just $799, is especially noteworthy since Apple’s been historically a little spare with their sale prices. But it’s real, and it’s still live right now for anyone looking to score a top-of-the-line MacBook at a terrific price.</p>
