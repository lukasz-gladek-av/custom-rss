            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Stop me if you’ve heard this one before: The latest <em>Call of Duty</em> game seems to contain AI-generated art that doesn’t look very good, and people aren’t happy about it. This time, it’s the newly released <a href="https://kotaku.com/cod-blops-7-campaign-coop-always-online-pause-co-op-xp-challenges-2000644358"><em>Black Ops 7.</em></a></p> <p>On November 14, <em>Call of Duty: Black Ops 7</em> launched across consoles and PC. And within a few hours, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/CODBlackOps7/comments/1owqr38/so_these_calling_cards_are_definitely_ai/">players online were sharing screenshots of artwork</a> within the game that they believe is AI-generated slop. And it’s hard not to agree.</p> <p><a href="https://x.com/Kumesicles/status/1988984517823197541">Looking at some of this artwork</a>, including in-game player banners, I notice the telltale signs of AI imagery, including at least one cartoon character that appears to have <a href="https://x.com/Kumesicles/status/1989327996126126344">six fingers</a>. Eyelines also don’t match up, and some objects seem vaguely defined. And almost all of it just looks really bland. Keep in mind, these are rewards you get for completing challenges, which makes it even more depressing; gee, thanks, some machine-vomited “art.”</p>

 <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">Almost every single campaign and endgame calling card in bo7 is like Grok Ai generated images its so insane <a href="https://t.co/5bCGNJQmgn">pic.twitter.com/5bCGNJQmgn</a></p> <p>— Kume (@Kumesicles) <a href="https://twitter.com/Kumesicles/status/1988984517823197541?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 13, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <p>Other players have shared screenshots of what looks like AI-generated artwork within<em> Black Ops 7’s</em> campaign, which this year is online-only and designed around multiplayer. Of course, we can’t know for sure which pieces of art in the latest<em> Call of Duty</em> were created by humans, which were generated by a machine, and which are a combo, with humans touching up crappy generated imagery.</p>

 <p>But we do know for a fact that <em>Black Ops 7</em> has AI art in it, as confirmed by the game’s Steam store page: “Our team uses generative AI tools to help develop some in-game assets.” This is the same disclaimer found on <a href="https://kotaku.com/black-ops-6-ai-calling-card-loading-screen-blops-6-cod-1851766313"><em>Black Ops 6′</em>s store page, which was added in February</a>.</p>

 <p><em>Kotaku</em> has contacted Activision about the AI art in <em>Black Ops 7 </em>and was sent this statement:</p> <blockquote><p>“Like so many around the world, we use a variety of digital tools, including AI tools, to empower and support our teams to create the best gaming experiences possible for our players. Our creative process continues to be led by the talented individuals in our studios.”</p></blockquote> <h2><em>Black Ops 7</em> and <em>Black Ops 6</em> both use AI art</h2> <p>If that sounds familiar, it’s because this is similar to what Activision and Treyarch said about <em>Black Ops 6</em> earlier this year, following months of players accusing the devs of using AI slop. In an interview with <em>IGN</em> in August, <a href="https://kotaku.com/black-ops-7-generative-ai-call-duty-gamescom-2025-slop-2000618833">Treyarch associate creative director Miles Leslie talked about using AI art</a> in <em>Black Ops 7.</em></p>

 <p>The developer claimed that “everything that goes into the game is touched by the team a hundred percent,” but did admit that AI tools are used to “help.” As to why some clearly AI-generated art that was seemingly not fixed up by a human slipped into <em>Black Ops 6,</em> Leslie told <em>IGN</em> it was an “accident.”</p> <p data-cy="paragraph">“That was never the intention,” said Leslie. “We’ve come out and been very clear that we use these as tools to help the team, but they do not replace any of the fantastic team members we have that are doing the final touches and building that content to put it in the game. So everything you play: human-created and touched. AI tools in the world we live in: it’s how do we streamline it? That’s really the goal. Not replace, but streamline.”</p> <p data-cy="paragraph">And with players discovering bland AI-generated images in <em>Call of Duty: Black Ops 7</em> and Activision openly confirming it and embracing it, it seems this is&nbsp;just how it works now, I guess.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-pokopia-animal-crossing-switch-2-nintendo-direct-2000625331"><i><span>Pokémon Pokopia</span></i></a> <span>is Omega Force’s swing at a cute and cozy </span><i><span>Pokémon </span></i><span>life sim in the vein of </span><i><span>Animal Crossing </span></i><span>or </span><i><span>Stardew Valley</span></i><span>. You play as a Ditto that transforms into a human and helps cultivate a new home for the local Pokémon wildlife, and though it’s a little unnerving seeing the beady-eyed human running around, it seems like a fun enough premise to support </span><i><span>Pokopia</span></i><span>’s life-sim gameplay. However, the more we see of the game, the more it seems like there might be a dark truth lurking beneath the surface, and fans are running wild with theories.</span></p> <p><span>Though it’s unclear how the </span><i><span>Pokémon </span></i><span>world may have gotten to this point, the prevailing theory is that the world of </span><i><span>Pokopia </span></i><span>may take place in some kind of post-apocalyptic timeline where humans and Pokémon have been separated for many years after some kind of disaster. There are clues hinting at this possibility dating as far back as the original reveal trailer from September. Ditto is shown escaping its Poké Ball in a cave that looks like it was, at one point, occupied by its trainer. The ‘mon looks at a Pokédex on the ground that is covered in dirt, and transforms into the trainer seen in a photo on the device. The fact that the dex has clearly been exposed to the elements for some time is concerning on its own, but there are more hints that something is amiss in </span><i><span>Pokopia</span></i><span>’s world than that.</span></p>

 <p><span>Yesterday, Nintendo released an extended </span><i><span>Pokopia </span></i><span>trailer that revealed a few new Pokémon variants, all of which seem to reflect the passage of time and lack of human interaction. A Snorlax is shown covered in moss, as if having slept long enough for nature to have overgrown its massive body. A Smeargle in the game is covered in paint, as if it has been painting without stopping or cleaning itself up. Then, there’s the biggest surprise: a white Pikachu named Peakychu who seems to be sickly, or even ghost-like. Could she be a specter of a long-dead Pikachu? Perhaps.</span></p>

  <p><span>The most explicit confirmation we get that humanity has been gone for a while is in Professor Tangrowth. This vine-covered Pokémon appears to be greying a bit and wears a broken TM machine like a doctor’s head mirror, as if it scavenged it in the rubble. In the trailer, we see Tangrowth tell Ditto that humans and Pokémon once lived in this place, but now that its buildings are destroyed and plants withered, he hasn’t seen anyone else in “quite some time.” He says this as he’s literally rummaging through the remains of what looks like a Pokémon Center that is now crumbled and covered in overgrowth. Whatever happened here that drove people and Pokémon away happened a long time ago. Some fans point out that what we see of the town’s layout looks similar to that of </span><a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@slantedgaming/video/7572354779658161463"><span>Fuchsia City</span></a><span> from </span><i><span>Red </span></i><span>and </span><i><span>Blue</span></i><span>, and given that </span><i><span>Pokopia </span></i><span>seems to take place near a collection of islands, it’s not out of the question that this is a post-disaster version of the coastal city.</span></p> <p><span>Whatever is going on, it’s clear that something terrible happened to this place that we’ll be sprucing up in </span><i><span>Pokopia</span></i><span>. </span><i><span>Pokémon </span></i><span>loves to delve into dark, life-or-death situations from time to time; I’m just surprised it might be doing so in its foray into the genre that’s supposed to be about feel-good vibes. We’ll know more when the game comes to Switch 2 on March 5.</span></p>

              <p><i><span>Concord</span></i><span>’s shutdown was one of the highest-profile failures in not just video games, </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/concord-sony-biggest-flop-failure-box-office-1851676475"><span>but all of entertainment last year</span></a><span>. Sony </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/concord-shutting-down-closing-servers-refunds-ps5-1851638566"><span>pulled the plug</span></a><span> on its </span><i><span>Guardians of the Galaxy</span></i><span>-esque hero shooter days after its PS5 and PC launch failed to bring in players, and then subsequently </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/concord-firewalk-studios-relaunch-ps5-sony-playstation-1851652811"><span>shut down its developer, Firewalk Studios</span></a><span>. It was a highly publicized mess of mismanagement and callous corporate calculus, and it was also a damn shame because the </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/concord-ps5-toxic-haters-heroes-shutdown-1851646309"><span>game was actually pretty alright</span></a><span>. Although the game seemed lost to time, some fans have taken it upon themselves to try and bring it back with fan-made servers, so if you wanted to see what all the fuss was about, you may have the chance.</span></p> <p><span>A group of fan modders has been working to rebuild </span><i><span>Concord</span></i><span>’s backend and create new servers (thanks, </span><a href="https://thegamepost.com/sony-concord-playable-again-custom-servers/"><i><span>TheGamePost</span></i></a><span>), and have officially played a match of the game once thought lost to time.&nbsp;</span></p>  <p><span>Red, one of the modders leading the project alongside Real, open_wizard, and Gwog, posted an update on Discord letting folks know the group had managed to play a match, though there are still a lot of bugs to iron out before they’re ready to open it up to more players.</span></p> <blockquote><p><span>After a long time of reverse engineering &amp; server development, we just managed to play a match of </span><i><span>Concord</span></i><span>! This is the match I played with open_wizard (don’t mind my horrible aim, I spend so much time reverse engineering that I no longer have the time to actually play games)</span></p> <p><span>The project is still WIP, it’s playable, but buggy. Once our servers are fully set up, we’ll begin doing some private playtesting, if anyone here wants to join those playtests, let me know (include what region/time zone you are in for convenience).</span></p></blockquote> <p><span>I still consider </span><i><span>Concord</span></i><span>’s fate</span> <span>to be a consequence of Sony’s terrible fumbling of its ill-advised live service pivot, but it’s always a bad thing when games are wiped from existence by their owners. A lot of people worked hard on </span><i><span>Concord</span></i><span>, and it deserves the dignity of being playable, even if Sony isn’t supporting it. So shoutout to fans for picking up the torch.</span></p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/since-rolling-out-this-black-friday-deal-on-blink-video-doorbell-52-off-amazon-sold-10k-units.1354036/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Buying a video doorbell might not sound like the most exciting gift, but it’s one of those practical purchases that ends up being useful for home security. Amazon already <strong>dropped Black Friday prices on its own products</strong> ahead of the official sales rush which explains why Blink cameras and doorbells are sitting at record lows right now.</p>
<p>The latest <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4647/">Blink video doorbell just hit $28 instead of its usual $59 price tag</a>, which makes it an incredibly affordable way to monitor your front door. This doorbell delivers <strong>head-to-toe HD video, infrared night vision, and up to two years of battery life</strong> on three AA batteries.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4647/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<p>The Blink video doorbell operates off of<strong> three included AA Energizer lithium batteries for up to two years</strong>&nbsp;which means you aren’t climbing ladders every few months to swap out dead cells. Extended battery life comes in the form of efficient power management that will only activate recording after motion gets detected or someone pushes the doorbell button. You can <strong>install this unit completely wire-free</strong> with the included mounting kit in just minutes; no electrical knowledge is required. And if you prefer a wired setup, you can hook it into your existing doorbell wiring.</p>



<h2>HD Video and Night Vision</h2>
<p>It <strong>captures a full head-to-toe view of anyone at your door</strong>&nbsp;which makes a much bigger difference than one would think. Cheaper doorbells usually cut off at chest level and don’t show packages on the ground or clearly show faces. The expanded field of view lets you see where delivery drivers place boxes, identify visitors before opening the door, or monitor your entire doorstep area within one frame. <strong>HD video quality remains clear during the day, and infrared night vision automatically kicks in when the light starts to fall</strong>. You can actually make out faces and read package labels at night instead of just some blurry shapes moving around.</p>
<p>Two-way audio lets you communicate with whoever’s at your door through the Blink app on your phone: You hear them clearly, and they hear you respond in real time. That proves incredibly handy when you’re not home but need to give delivery instructions, tell a friend where the spare key is or let a visitor know you’ll be there in a few minutes.</p>



<p><strong>Amazon includes a free 30-day trial of the Blink Subscription Plan</strong>, which stores your video clips securely in the cloud and adds person detection. That way, you avoid most of the false alerts from cars, animals, or trees that may be moving in the wind, only to receive notifications if an actual human were to approach your door.</p>
<p>The <strong>doorbell supports Alexa-enabled devices</strong> so you can see who’s at your door from any of your Echo Show or Fire TV devices. You can ask Alexa to show your front door camera, arm or disarm your system, or get notifications on your smart speakers about activity at your door. This should come as no surprise as Amazon owns both Blink and Alexa, after all-and the two systems interact seamlessly with no need for elaborate setup routines.</p>
<p>At $28, this doorbell costs less than dinner for two while providing real security value for your home. The deal is live on Amazon right now, and considering how quickly these early Black Friday prices tend to sell out, grabbing one sooner rather than later probably makes sense.</p>
