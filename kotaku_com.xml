Unlike the rest of the Switch 2 exclusive’s game modes, this one doesn’t support local co-op.

It showed players exploring different zones, attempting P-switch challenges, collecting coins, and discovering other secrets. “In Free Roam, you can also meet up with your crew anywhere in this game’s world,” the company <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.nintendo.com/au/news-and-articles/mario-kart-world-direct-revs-up-new-details-on-the-biggest-mario-kart-ever/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.nintendo.com/au/news-and-articles/mario-kart-world-direct-revs-up-new-details-on-the-biggest-mario-kart-ever/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">wrote at the time</a></span>. “Drive around, see where your friends are on the map and warp to them instantly. Then race, battle with custom rules or take a road trip to see the sights together.”<br></p><p>While that’s not confirmation of local splitscreen, it did <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/mariokart/comments/1l3mf8v/no_split_screen_freeroam_unless_in_empty_wireless/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/mariokart/comments/1l3mf8v/no_split_screen_freeroam_unless_in_empty_wireless/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">give some the impression</a></span> that free roam would be a multiplayer-friendly mode. But it turns out that’s not really the case. There are essentially two versions of Free Roam. One is single-player and includes all of the challenges and collectibles. The other is a glorified online lobby where you drive around in-between matches but there’s not really anything to do. And neither lets you play with another person sitting next to you.</p><p>Now, F<em>orza Horizon 5 </em>doesn’t support local co-op either. Rendering an open world is very resource intensive, and duplicating that for a second player in a second screen on the same system even more so. There are probably very valid technical and logistical hurdles that explain why Free Roam doesn’t have local splitscreen co-op. Is it still a bummer? Definitely. </p><p>As <em>Remap</em> co-host Patrick Klepek alluded to on X, the limitation will be especially galling for families who want to play together, or for parents with kids who struggle with taking turns. My own children, at least, love undirected play in video games. <em>Minecraft</em> and <em>The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom</em> are the games they spent the most time with for that exact reason. Free Roam was by far the thing that they were most intrigued with when it came to <em>Mario Kart World</em>. They like racing but they’ve done it before (and have trouble with losing). </p><p>Free Roam, with its undirected and uncompetitive gameplay, looked poised to answer both of those needs, making <em>Mario Kart World </em>something they’d love messing around in just for fun. Unfortunately, when it comes to multiplayer at least, the meat of the $80 sequel is still very much in traditional racing modes, just with some new open-world twists. </p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

The idea of getting a new game in the franchise, even after the woefully irrelevant <em>Thief </em>(2014), is thrilling. But god, no, not as some VR gimmick. But no, I’m not going to wallow! Instead, I’m going to take this opportunity to celebrate what we already have, and what we can still enjoy.</p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="196470" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="The Week In Games: Reignited Rivalries And More New Releases" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="123" data-playlist="196470,195922,196345" data-current="196470"><div><p>The Week In Games: Reignited Rivalries And More New Releases</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196470/196470_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196470/196470_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196470/196470_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196470/196470_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/22020.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>Look, I’ll be honest.

Covering the embarrassing awfulness of Embracer Group’s handling of every property it mindlessly snaffled up, and indeed the mediocrity of 2014's peculiarly missing-the-point Eidos-Montreal-made entry, Fraser articulates why this is the opposite of what anyone should want to do with the franchise. So kudos there, and go give it a read. Although I will repeat the vital point here: sure, <em>Half-Life Alyx </em>and <em>Superhot VR</em> are great, and maybe by some miracle <em>Thief VR</em> will be the third game worth owning the tech for, but if you don’t own a PSVR2 hat, then this is a game that’s going to cost you $400+ minimum!</p><p>(And can I make clear, this is no qualitative judgement on <em>Thief VR</em> which I obviously haven’t played, nor is it one on the no doubt enormously talented, incredibly hard-working people who are making this game. I wish them the very best. I also wish they’d been given the chance to make a full <em>Thief</em> game that everyone could play.)</p><p>But we’re here to be optimistic! Yes, it’s horrendous that the rights to one of gaming’s greatest franchises—the games that began the stealth genre, and indeed inspired everything from <em>Deus Ex</em> to <em>Hitman </em>to <em>Dishonored</em>—are in the hands of a management so inept that the only ambition they have for it is to waste it on a VR game that only a handful of people will play. But that doesn’t make the original games disappear. They’re still with us. And they’re still utterly amazing.</p><p><em>Thief </em>is about a guy named Garrett. Growing up as a homeless orphan, Garrett is now a master thief, living in The City, set in a fantasy version of the Middle Ages; part steampunk, part wizardry. There are three factions: The Keepers, the Pagans and the Hammerites, with Garrett assigned to none, and willing to steal from all. The games see Garrett reluctantly get involved in the complex storylines betwixt the trio of groups vying for power, doing his best to have nothing to do with any of them, but profiting from the mayhem.</p><figure id="" data-id="1b475501d576679a2f33034b24f16a61" data-recommend-id="image://1b475501d576679a2f33034b24f16a61" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="720" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The box art for the first Thief game, with Garrett holding his bow." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="The box art for the first Thief game, with Garrett holding his bow." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Mobygames / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="1b475501d576679a2f33034b24f16a61" data-recommend-id="image://1b475501d576679a2f33034b24f16a61" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="720" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The box art for the first Thief game, with Garrett holding his bow." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>1998's <em>Thief: The Dark Project</em> <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.eurogamer.net/retrospective-thief-the-dark-project-article&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/retrospective-thief-the-dark-project-article" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">is an astonishing creation</a></span>.

Heck, <em>Thief</em>’s graphics were criticized for being dated when it was released in ‘98, and it didn’t matter then any more than it does now. Because <em>Thief</em> is a game about atmosphere, and by “atmosphere” I mean “darkness,” and it has that by the metric ton. Seriously, the textures on the walls in the Hammerite temples matter very little when the first thing you do on entering any room or corridor is snuff out all the torches. Light is your enemy, shadows your only safety, and you’ll immediately embrace the darkness.</p><p>It’s incredible how quickly this draws you in, how soon you’re entirely in the role, scooping up every piece of loot as you nip from corner to corner, bonking an enemy on the back of the head to slip through to a passageway. It’s totally absorbing, and absolutely compelling.</p><p>But what I think makes <em>Thief</em> such a stand-out game almost 30 years later is a philosophy that far too few games have had the courage to try: this is a game where the higher you make the difficulty, the fewer people you’re allowed to kill. Garrett absolutely <em>can </em>murder in these games, and should you choose to, you can go through a level killing each and every guard you encounter. But turn up the difficulty, and rather than the enemies getting stronger or more difficult to kill, you’re not allowed to hurt them at all! That’s revolutionary! It’s still revolutionary 27 years on. Instead of demanding better twitch reflexes or greater amounts of durability, the harder the game, the better you had to be at being a thief.</p><p><em>Thief II: The Metal Age</em> is very similar game, but in the best possible way. It’s more! It’s more of one of the best games ever! Where the first <em>Thief</em> rather over-relied on the presence of zombies (it was as if developers Looking Glass didn’t quite dare not to include a traditional gaming enemy), here there are fewer monsters and instead more humans to avoid, set in larger, more sprawling levels with astonishing variety in how you can approach a challenge. It was, I would argue, the emergence of the immersive sim.</p><p><em>Thief II</em> came out in 2000, when I was at university, and one of my most profound memories of the game took place outside of it. I had been playing it a great deal, just delighted to be back in The City, loving every second. On this particular evening, I was going to see a friend, and so I walked into town. As I went down the street, I found myself walking only in shadows, looking ahead to see where streetlights were shining, and calculating a path that would avoid them as best as possible. It was a concerningly long time before I realized what I was doing. (Another real-world symptom was starting to view the world by the potential of its rooftops, looking out windows to plan paths where I could get between buildings, before remembering that I probably ought not.)</p><figure id="" data-id="a1a33b78784bd93190334ec4da26272a" data-recommend-id="image://a1a33b78784bd93190334ec4da26272a" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="720" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Garrett crouched with a dagger from the Thief 3 box art." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Garrett crouched with a dagger from the Thief 3 box art." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Mobygames / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="a1a33b78784bd93190334ec4da26272a" data-recommend-id="image://a1a33b78784bd93190334ec4da26272a" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="720" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Garrett crouched with a dagger from the Thief 3 box art." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>2004's <em>Thief: The Dark Shadows</em> was, on its release, embroiled in some woefully unnecessary complaining. At this point, with the voice of the internet becoming an unavoidable thing, people were determined to find everything they could to be pre-emptively cross about. Looking Glass Studios, the legendary development studio that gave us <em>Ultima Underworld</em>, <em>System Shock</em> and <em>Thief</em>, had tragically come to an end in 2000. Ion Storm Austin may have given us the extraordinary <em>Deus Ex</em> in 2000, but they’d also given us follow-up <em>Deus Ex: Invisible War</em> just a year before <em>Thief III</em>, a game that had unquestionably been restricted in scope by 2003's need to co-develop for the fledgling Xbox. (It remains massively underrated, but it also undeniably didn’t match its predecessor due to the wild constraints and tiny levels imposed by the weakness of the Xbox as a machine.) So people were ready to absolutely unload on <em>Deadly Shadows</em>.</p><p>Yes, the levels were smaller than in <em>Thief II</em>. Yes—and dear god, it’s incredible to remember just how much stupid asinine fuss was made about this some two decades on—the loot did glint. But <em>oh my goodness</em>, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/thief-deadly-shadows-will-still-have-you-fearing-the-light-some-16-years-on&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/thief-deadly-shadows-will-still-have-you-fearing-the-light-some-16-years-on" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">this is an extraordinarily good game</a></span>. <em>Deadly Shadows</em> may not have had the acres-wide playing areas, but instead it sported some of the finest level design in all of gaming, boosted by stunning storytelling, and one of the most memorable levels ever created in any game ever, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/making-of-thief-deadly-shadows&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/making-of-thief-deadly-shadows" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Cradle</a></span>. It was, and is, one of the most all-consuming games you’ll ever play, where you’ll lose yourself into the character you’re playing like nothing else, fearing all forms of light for weeks after you play.</p><p>So yes, it sucks beyond all belief that Embracer has the rights to this greatest of series. The company could be offering established indie teams the opportunity to craft a new <em>Thief</em> game in the spirit of the original three, or even trying to get the band back together and offering Looking Glass/Ion Storm alumni the chance. It could be doing so much, and instead its decision is to make a VR game that’s already buried under the logo of the unloved 2014 game that had so little to do with the games before it, for a format that most people are long over.</p><p>But it cannot take away what we already have, and that is something to be treasured. And right this moment, by sheer lovely coincidence, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://store.steampowered.com/bundle/1459/Thief_Collection/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://store.steampowered.com/bundle/1459/Thief_Collection/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">you can get all three games for less than a dollar each!</a></span> That’s <em>incredible</em>! (You can even get the daft, goth-ridden, watched-<em>The-Crow</em>-too-much-as-a-kid 2014 <em>Thief </em>for $3.)</p><p>And you should. You’ll be so glad you did.</p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
