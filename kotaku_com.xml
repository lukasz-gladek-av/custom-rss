The team provides internal art and technical support to first-party PlayStation studios and worked closely with Naughty Dog on the recent <em>Last of Us Part 1</em> and <em>2</em> remasters among other projects. </p><p>Sony did not immediately respond to a request for comment. </p><p>“It was tough waking up to messages that many friends and former coworkers from PSVA were laid off this morning,” former PSVA project manager Abby LeMaster, now at Riot Games, posted on LinkedIn on Monday. “The layoffs today hit hard. PSVA let go of developers with decades of subject matter expertise; talent that will be extraordinarily difficult to recoup.
