Some are worried that it simply means Bandai Namco is planning to dole out each new style over months and years through a relentless drip-feed of microtransaction add-ons as it’s done with <em>Dragon Ball Xenoverse 2</em>. <em>Sparking</em>&nbsp;<em>Zero </em>seems destined to be the ultimate <em>DBZ</em> sim, but no <em>DBZ</em> sim is complete without more robust dress-up options. </p><p>Enter modders who are at least bringing some of these costume changes to the PC version of the game. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://gamebanana.com/mods/551869&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://gamebanana.com/mods/551869" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">A Piccolo Postboy outfit</a></span> was added to the GameBanana mod repository yesterday.

Of course, there are plenty of other outfits still missing, like Goku and Vegeta’s “SAB” winter jackets from the <em>Dragon Ball Super: Broly </em>movie and Gohan’s Kai outfit from the Buu Saga. </p><p>I can forgive some of these missing from the game at launch, but too many of the best alternate costumes seem MIA at the moment. I’m not above paying for them all if they get rolled out later. It would have felt more satisfying if they were all late-game unlockables, though. </p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Somewhat barebones back when Behaviour Interactive released it in 2016. <em>Dead by Daylight</em> has continued to get new updates and improvements. There’s also plenty of licensed crossovers with villains ranging from <em>Halloween</em>’s Michael Myers to <em>Silent Hill</em>’s Pyramid Head.

It’s laden with genre tropes and familiar character archetypes, but delivered by studio Supermassive Games in a way that lets you in on the joke. “Anyone who’s spent time with horror movies knows how much fun (and frustrating) it is to yell at the screen when characters are doing increasingly stupid things in the face of imminent and obvious danger,” Patrick Klepek <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/until-dawn-the-kotaku-review-1726108417&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/until-dawn-the-kotaku-review-1726108417">wrote in his <em>Kotaku </em>review at the time</a></span>. “<em>Until Dawn </em>lets you be those people—finally, you can do more than yell at the screen!” It’s fun enough to play alone, but better enjoyed with someone else to turn to on the couch and go “lmao are you kidding me?!” The remake just came out but many fans recommend sticking with the original version. </p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="5c750b31aef4edb804de213cea98b384" data-recommend-id="image://5c750b31aef4edb804de213cea98b384" data-format="png" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="A zombie walks on a beach" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A zombie walks on a beach" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Deep Silver</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="5c750b31aef4edb804de213cea98b384" data-recommend-id="image://5c750b31aef4edb804de213cea98b384" data-format="png" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="A zombie walks on a beach" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p><em>Dead Island 2</em> isn’t a particularly scary game but it is a gory one. The zombie limb severing sequel arrived after so many years in development hell it seemed impossible that it might actually be good. Instead, the 2023 undead sandbox is a surprisingly fun and absurd romp through the zombie apocalypse, complete with RPG-lite mechanics to make you feel like all that hacking and slashing is adding up to something. “I love that this game offers a chain of semi-pure fun; it’s a fable with a lesson, if you want it to be, or regular zombie mayhem if you don’t,” <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/dead-island-2-review-release-date-dambuster-ps5-rpg-1850345905&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/dead-island-2-review-release-date-dambuster-ps5-rpg-1850345905">wrote Ashley Bardhan in her review</a></span>. </p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="99047aeffcf38daf74c04ef5a3316759" data-recommend-id="image://99047aeffcf38daf74c04ef5a3316759" data-format="jpg" data-width="2410" data-height="1355" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="A guy hides from zombies on a motorcycle.

Okay, they’re not technically zombies. Instead they’re called Freakers, but the result is more or less the same. The third-person open world game is a bit like a zombie apocalypse by way of Far Cry map cleanup. There are some light survival mechanics and beautiful landscapes to conquer. “It’s about shooting things and foraging for useful equipment to better your chances at staying alive in an increasingly hostile environment,” <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/days-gone-the-kotaku-review-1834287975&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/days-gone-the-kotaku-review-1834287975">wrote Joshua Rivera in his review</a></span>. “Those are expressed through play, and even when said play is derivative as <em>Days Gone</em> is, it can still be compelling.”</p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="3f34381633eec65d5acff3825629eb73" data-recommend-id="image://3f34381633eec65d5acff3825629eb73" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="720" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="A boat approaches a lighthouse " data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A boat approaches a lighthouse " data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Black Salt Games</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="3f34381633eec65d5acff3825629eb73" data-recommend-id="image://3f34381633eec65d5acff3825629eb73" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="720" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="A boat approaches a lighthouse " data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/days-gone-the-kotaku-review-1834287975&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/days-gone-the-kotaku-review-1834287975">What if a fishing game was full of psychological horror</a></span>?

The stealth sequences can be annoying, but Hauer’s lowkey delivery helps keep the heady concept grounded.</p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="f31d02e6259f5e4751427176293b4ab1" data-recommend-id="image://f31d02e6259f5e4751427176293b4ab1" data-format="jpg" data-width="1620" data-height="911" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="An astronaut approaches alien horrors" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="An astronaut approaches alien horrors" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Housemarque</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="f31d02e6259f5e4751427176293b4ab1" data-recommend-id="image://f31d02e6259f5e4751427176293b4ab1" data-format="jpg" data-width="1620" data-height="911" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="An astronaut approaches alien horrors" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p><em>Returnal</em> is praised for its twitchy bullet hell action and uncompromising high-concept roguelike structure, but it’s space horror mood is also an important part of the <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/returnal-the-kotaku-review-1846786237&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/returnal-the-kotaku-review-1846786237">overall 2021 GOTY package</a></span>.

Originally released in Japan in September 2023, <em>Ys X</em> now at last has a worldwide English-language release. And yet, despite all this, you’ve never played a <em>Ys</em> game! Let us convince you this is the perfect place to start.</p><p>Before I say anything to you about <em>Ys X: Nordics</em>, I need to level with you for a second: <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/ys-x-nordics-guide-lacrimosa-dana-oath-felghana-1851635135&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/ys-x-nordics-guide-lacrimosa-dana-oath-felghana-1851635135">I’m a huge fan of Nihon Falcom’s <em>Ys</em> series</a></span>. This long-running action-RPG series has captivated me since I first played <em>Ys I&amp;II </em>on the TurboGrafx-CD, and my casual blogging about the series eventually turned into my professional writing career. Every writer has inherent biases to consider when recommending a video game on the internet, and it’s only fair that you know that my biases are especially strong in this case.</p><p>With that said, after pouring roughly 50 hours into the official English version of <em>Ys X: Nordics</em>, I’m here to tell you that I <em>really</em> loved playing this game. This is easily the biggest evolution the series has seen in its core gameplay since <em>Ys Seven</em>, and I eagerly sought out every side quest and optional boss I could find just to make the experience last. Despite the absolute deluge of quality RPGs released this year, <em>Ys X</em> is one of my favorite games of 2024.</p><p>If you’ve never dipped your toes into <em>Ys</em> before, know that <em>Ys X</em><strong> is a mostly self-contained story early</strong> in the overall series canon. You can jump right into this game without feeling like you’re missing the plot from the other games. With that said, is <em>Ys X</em> really the best way to get into the series, or should you opt for one of the earlier entries instead? To answer that, I’ll break down my biggest pros and cons about <em>Ys X</em> below, and I’ll give my firm opinion on who I think would most enjoy playing <em>Ys X</em> first at the end.</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="5cf161af2f3d15d324c12620c787c63e" data-recommend-id="image://5cf161af2f3d15d324c12620c787c63e" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt=" A boy with red hair swings his sword to hit the leg of a giant golem.

Other recent <em>Ys</em> games played as fast-paced hack-and-slash action-RPGs, with an emphasis on perfectly timed dodging and switching between party members to exploit enemy weaknesses. In <em>Ys X</em>, the party system has been minimized, and there are no more enemy weaknesses. Protagonists Adol and Karja now fight in tandem as you rapidly switch between the two to barrage enemies with quick strikes and build huge combos. Similarly, the dodge mechanics have mostly coalesced into Adol and Karja’s block function, with perfectly timed parries resulting in the series’ trademark “Flash Guard.”</p><p>These changes transform the combat of <em>Ys X</em> so much that my muscle memory from past <em>Ys</em> games completely failed me at first. However, once I got the hang of it, I couldn’t believe the colorful flurries of quick sword strikes I was pulling off on screen. Since Adol and Karja have separate SP meters which their special attacks consume, combat felt like a dance where I constantly looked for the right moments to tag the two in and out of battle to maintain a functionally endless stream of special attacks. Meanwhile, by activating the “Duo Mode,” Adol and Karja fight as a singular unit to deliver weighty attacks that I used to generously dispatch huge groups of foes and lay the smack down on bosses whenever they left themselves open.</p><p>Duo Mode pairs perfectly with <em>Ys X</em>’s block, as perfectly timed parries cause Adol and Karja to lock steel with their foes until they push them back and inflict damage-boosted counter attacks. Make no mistake, this is still a very fast action game, just like previous series entries—it’s just that <em>Ys X</em> isn’t afraid to slow the action down at times, to let you build up to those moments of sheer speed the previous games were known for. Falcom basically created a battle system that embodies the feeling of a well designed <em>Sonic The Hedgehog</em> level.</p><p>I could go on, but at this point, you can just look at combo videos uploaded from the Japanese release of <em>Ys X</em> and see how cool it looks in motion yourself. It’s just good, man.</p><h3 id="h173890"><a id=""></a>The cast of characters is lovable</h3><figure id="" data-id="e5bb503bc11ce4b0c90739d95d0116ef" data-recommend-id="image://e5bb503bc11ce4b0c90739d95d0116ef" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1081" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="A boy with red hair excitedly talks to a girl with a blond hair as she disapprovingly gives him a side eye glare." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A boy with red hair excitedly talks to a girl with a blond hair as she disapprovingly gives him a side eye glare." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Nihon Falcom / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="e5bb503bc11ce4b0c90739d95d0116ef" data-recommend-id="image://e5bb503bc11ce4b0c90739d95d0116ef" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1081" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="A boy with red hair excitedly talks to a girl with a blond hair as she disapprovingly gives him a side eye glare." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p><em>Ys</em> games generally aren’t known for gripping storylines. However, this series excels at creating warm atmospheres where virtually every NPC has a name and their own personal stories that advance in the background of the main plot. <em>Ys X</em> especially excels on this front, featuring an emotive crew that supports Adol and Karja as they sail the seas in their boat. However, in a surprising twist for the series, it’s the protagonists that steal the show this time around.</p><p><em>Ys X</em> is a coming of age tale, in which teenagers Adol and Karja are literally bound together by a thread of fate (it’s literally wrapped around their wrists like cuffs) as they join forces to figure out why they’re so attached, and rescue the residents of the town Carnac. While Adol is typically a silent protagonist, he’s surprisingly expressive in <em>Ys X</em>. He’s a flighty goofball with a mischievous streak, but his boundless thirst for adventure and his penchant to run headfirst into danger makes him easy to root for when the chips are down. Meanwhile, while Karja comes off as a stereotypical tsundere at first, her calculated demeanor endeared me to her as she grew into the leader that the people of Carnac needed. Make no mistake, though; Karja’s just as much the badass fighter that Adol is, and it’s a joy to see how well together they work as a team</p><p>Even as soon as the game’s second chapter, Adol and Karja establish a genuine, earnest bond with each other as they share stories of their lives and support each other through their hardships. Whenever they defeat a major boss together, they celebrate with a fistbump or a highfive in exactly the same way you might rejoice after beating a tough challenge with a friend in a video game. They have disagreements and get into nasty arguments, but if anything, these moments further drive home just how authentic their bond together feels. <em>Ys X</em> feels surprisingly personal, and it’s one of the best ways to get to know series protagonist Adol. It’s a low-stakes story by RPG standards, but the overarching themes of realizing your potential and finding meaning in life resonated with me thanks to how well the characters were written.</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="c8cb6ea80d785961130fca0b9e8b5c82" data-recommend-id="image://c8cb6ea80d785961130fca0b9e8b5c82" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1081" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="A boy with red hair looks down at a large red treasure chest." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A boy with red hair looks down at a large red treasure chest." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Nihon Falcom / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="c8cb6ea80d785961130fca0b9e8b5c82" data-recommend-id="image://c8cb6ea80d785961130fca0b9e8b5c82" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1081" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="A boy with red hair looks down at a large red treasure chest." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p><em>Ys X</em> naturally isn’t perfect, and these were my biggest nitpicks throughout my playthrough.</p><h3 id="h173891"><a id=""></a>It’s a surprisingly slow burn</h3><p>In the past, <em>Ys</em> games were generally no-nonsense action-RPGs. After only a handful of minutes to set up the story, the older entries generally threw you headfirst into adventure and carried that energy until you reached the end credits. By comparison, <em>Ys X</em> spends much more time establishing its cast and setting the stage for its story. To its credit, it sprinkles in combat throughout its introduction, and does at least make its tutorials go by pretty fast. Still, the game doesn’t quite hit its stride until Chapter 4, even though I still had fun up until that point.</p><h3 id="h173892"><a id=""></a>The enemy variety is a bit weak</h3><p>As much as I loved the combat system of <em>Ys X</em>, I did wish it had more unique challenges to test my mettle. The pool of common enemies is surprisingly limited, with the same foes popping up in almost every single dungeon in the game. One miniboss appears a double digit number of times before the game ends. You could argue this is a good thing for action game newbies, since you’ll have several opportunities to learn how to perfectly parry each enemy’s attacks. Still, I did feel corners were cut in the enemy design.</p><p>The game does give its enemies some new attacks as you progress, so it’s not all the same from start to finish. I also never felt a feeling of repetition sink in thanks to just how quickly Adol and Karja unlock new special attacks to level up. Still, once I saw some of the crazy bosses that pop up in the final act, I wished I’d seen those kinds of challenges throughout the entire game.</p><h3 id="h173893"><a id=""></a>It’s visually a little bland</h3><p><em>Ys</em> games generally operate on modest budgets, so cutting-edge graphics were never on the table for <em>Ys X</em>. Still, as I sailed from island to island, I found locations started to blend together, since they mostly looked the same. I can’t say for sure if <em>Ys X</em> recycles textures from <em>Ys VIII: Lacrimosa of Dana</em>, but I did consistently feel I wasn’t looking at anything new.</p><p>To be fair to <em>Ys X</em>, the characters themselves are wonderfully expressive. There are some really fun cutscenes that endeared me even more to the main cast of characters, so the graphical budget was invested wisely overall. Again, this just felt like an area where corners were cut. Given the state of the game industry right now, I personally can’t hold this too hard against Falcom.</p><h3 id="h173894"><a id=""></a>Older <em>Ys</em> games had stronger soundtracks</h3><p>I want to be very clear here: <em>Ys X</em> has very good music. This is the first <em>Ys</em> game to feature Shuntaro Koguchi, and his contributions capture the catchy hooks and energy that have made past entries in the series so memorable. There are several tracks in the game that I have repeated nonstop since I finished the game, which includes an absolute banger of a final boss track.</p><p>Still, the soundtrack of <em>Ys X</em> doesn’t quite evoke that sense of awe that past games in the series consistently captured. That “<em>Ys</em> moment” where the adventure kicks off while some of the best video game music you’ve ever heard in your life plays never really came to me, even though I still enjoyed the tunes. Bafflingly, some of the strongest songs in the soundtrack are criminally underutilized. One song that could have easily evoked that “<em>Ys</em> moment” was relegated to the end credits! Again, this is a very good soundtrack by RPG standards, just a weaker one by <em>Ys</em> standards.</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="03b391dfc32072e3f72499d94d7e4ea4" data-recommend-id="image://03b391dfc32072e3f72499d94d7e4ea4" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="A boat creates a wake as it cuts through a vast expanse of water." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A boat creates a wake as it cuts through a vast expanse of water." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Nihon Falcom / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="03b391dfc32072e3f72499d94d7e4ea4" data-recommend-id="image://03b391dfc32072e3f72499d94d7e4ea4" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="A boat creates a wake as it cuts through a vast expanse of water." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>This is neither good nor bad in my book, but this piece wouldn’t be complete if I didn’t talk about arguably the most divisive part of <em>Ys X</em>. For the first time in the series, <em>Ys X</em> features a classic RPG-style world map that Adol’s group traverses via a boat. These segments are a game within a game, as you can get into battles with enemy ships and upgrade your vessel with materials you find on your journey. This is conceptually similar to the airship traversal from the Dreamcast classic RPG <em>Skies of Arcadia</em>, which means I can finally check “talk about <em>Skies of Arcadia</em> this year” off my to-do list.</p><p>I enjoyed this seafaring side of the game, but it doesn’t make the best first impression. Boat combat is wildly different from the game’s core battle system, and at the start of the game, your vessel is <em>very</em> slow. Pro tip: <strong>Wait to focus on traveling to marked locations on your map until you’re about halfway through Chapter Four</strong>. This is when you can start purchasing speed upgrades that make the boat way easier to handle, and you’ll actually start to spot points of interest in the distance that are worth traveling to. There’s no need to frustrate yourself trying to fill in your map and beat ship battles in the early game.</p><p>Funny enough, there is a toggle in the options menu to instantly max out your boat’s stats. So if you <em>really</em> hate the boat sections, you can at least circumvent it quite a bit.</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="43ad15c24d6de857679de81358b66471" data-recommend-id="image://43ad15c24d6de857679de81358b66471" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Two fighters attack a large jellyfish monster in unison as bright streaks of fire and ice shine off of their weapons." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Two fighters attack a large jellyfish monster in unison as bright streaks of fire and ice shine off of their weapons." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Nihon Falcom / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="43ad15c24d6de857679de81358b66471" data-recommend-id="image://43ad15c24d6de857679de81358b66471" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Two fighters attack a large jellyfish monster in unison as bright streaks of fire and ice shine off of their weapons." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>Again, I want to stress that I <em>really</em> liked <em>Ys X: Nordics</em>. I’d rank it as a top five <em>Ys</em> game. As far as whether you should start with <em>Ys X</em>, I’d specifically recommend it for two groups of people.</p><p><strong>1: If you’re an action game enthusiast, <em>Ys X</em> should be your starting point</strong>. The combat mechanics are so enthralling and expressive once you get a handle on the controls, and even on the Nightmare difficulty I never felt like <em>Ys X</em> demanded grinding to win. If you enjoyed the gameplay of <em>Final Fantasy XVI</em>, you should enjoy <em>Ys X</em>.</p><p><strong>2: If you already know you want to play the rest of the <em>Ys</em> games, <em>Ys X</em> is an excellent starting point</strong>. It’s one of the earliest games in the overall series timeline, and the ending literally segues right into 2012’s <em>Ys: Memories of Celceta</em>. From there, you can follow the Chronology of <em>Ys</em> <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.digitalemelas.com/index_ys.php&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.digitalemelas.com/index_ys.php" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">as laid out by Digital Emelas</a></span>, and you can take a detour to play <em>Ys I&amp;II</em> and <em>Ys Origin</em> whenever you feel ready for them.</p><p><strong>For everyone else, <em>Ys X: Nordics</em> is a good starting point for the series, but the “best” starting point is debatable</strong>. While <em>Ys X</em> moves the series forward in important ways, it stumbles a bit in areas that fans especially value in these games. The music and consistent high energy has always been the soul of <em>Ys</em>, so a lesser showing on these fronts does make <em>Ys X</em> land slightly weaker than other past games have. <strong>If you’d like to learn about other starting points I’d personally recommend, you can check </strong><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/ys-x-nordics-guide-lacrimosa-dana-oath-felghana-1851635135&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/ys-x-nordics-guide-lacrimosa-dana-oath-felghana-1851635135"><strong>my <em>Ys</em> starter guide here</strong></a></span>.</p><p>Regardless, <strong>I do recommend you play <em>Ys X: Nordics</em> in one way or another, especially if you’ve bothered to read this far</strong>. A <strong>demo</strong> for the game is out now on PC, PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, and Nintendo Switch, which does allow you to transfer your save file to the full game. By the time you approach the end of the demo content, you should hopefully see what makes <em>Ys X</em> so special. Or maybe you won’t—I don’t know what life is like for someone who never owned a TurboGrafx growing up.</p><p>.</p></div></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
