              <p>Another month means another batch of <a href="https://kotaku.com/amazon-prime-gaming-free-pc-steam-games-january-2025-1851736481">“free” Amazon Prime games.</a> This time around, Amazon is giving away what I (and many others) consider to be one of the best PC games ever made: <em>Civilization 4.</em> Beyond that, you can currently grab the also-excellent<em> Into The Breach</em> for nothing and over the next week weeks, even more games will be available for Amazon Prime subscribers.</p> <p><a href="https://gaming.amazon.com/home">If you hop over to Amazon Prime Gaming</a> and are currently subscribed to Amazon Prime, you can snag PC copies of <em>Sid Meier’s Civilization 4: The Complete Edition,</em> <em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons: Ravenloft Series</em>, and<em> Into the Breach.</em> Then, throughout the rest of September, Amazon will add more free games, including <em>Spelljammer, Pixel Cafe, and Tower of Time.</em> Even better, <em>Civ4</em>, <em>Spelljammer</em>, and other PC games given away this month are delivered via GOG codes, which means once you claim them, you own them completely with no DRM. Now ain’t that nifty!</p> <p>I personally think that <em>Civilization 4</em> is the pinnacle of the series, <a href="https://kotaku.com/let-s-rank-the-civilization-games-worst-to-best-1842571299/6">even if former <em>Kotaku</em> writer Luke Plunkett prefers <em>Civ5</em> over it</a>. Yeah, some bits of it are a little tedious and annoying, but the vibes are immaculate, and most of it still holds up perfectly today. Plus, it will run easily on any modern PC. If you were let down by <em>Civ6</em> or <em>Civ7</em>, check out <em>Civilization 4</em>. Just set aside like 9 hours of your day first, as it will consume them in a flash.</p>

 <p>Here’s the full list of games, as well as when they will be available for free on Amazon Prime and which storefronts they use. Oh, and keep in mind these are all PC games; sorry, console-only players.</p> <h3>Now available</h3> <ul> <li>Dungeons &amp; Dragons: Ravenloft Series (GOG Code)</li> <li>Into The Breach (Epic Games Store)</li> <li>Sid Meier’s Civilization 4: The Complete Edition (GOG Code)</li> </ul> <h3>September 11</h3> <ul> <li>Afterimage (Amazon Games App)</li> <li>Spelljammer: Pirates of Realmspace (GOG Code)</li> <li>Tower of Time (GOG Code)</li> <li>Subterrain: Mines of Titan [(Amazon Games App)</li> </ul> <h3>September 18</h3> <ul> <li>Residual (GOG Code)</li> <li>Fate: The Cursed King (GOG Code)</li> </ul> <h3>September 25</h3> <ul> <li>Mystical Riddles: Ghostly Park Collector’s Edition (Legacy Games Code)</li> <li>Pixel Cafe (Amazon Games App)</li> </ul> <p>Also, some games added in previous months are still floating around on Amazon Prime Gaming’s site, so if you haven’t grabbed those freebies yet and you’re a Prime subscriber, you should check out everything on the site. You may find a few hidden gems still waiting to be played.</p>

              <p>Many, many RPG fans are patiently awaiting the <a href="https://kotaku.com/kingdom-hearts-iv-4-square-enix-disney-announced-reveal-1848774720">next installment in the <em>Kingdom Hearts</em> franchise</a>. And a lot of those people are waiting for <em>Final Fantasy VII Remake</em>‘s third and final installment, too. As you might expect, some are worried about how development is proceeding on these two massive Square Enix RPGs, and to help calm those players down, <em>FF7</em> and <em>KH4</em> director Tetsuya Nomura has attempted to reassure us all that things are going “smoothly.”</p> <p><a href="https://www.gematsu.com/2025/09/final-fantasy-vii-remake-part-three-and-kingdom-hearts-iv-development-progressing-smoothly-tetsuya-nomura-confirms">As reported by <em>Gematsu</em></a>, during Friday’s <em>Final Fantasy VII: Ever Crisis </em>2nd Anniversary broadcast, Nomura hopped in toward the end after seemingly spotting comments in the chat asking about <em>FF7 Remake’s</em> third installment. While he didn’t have a release date to share, he wanted everyone to relax. The game is on schedule, okay?</p>  <div data-qa="virtual-list-item" role="listitem" aria-roledescription="message" data-qa-hover="true" data-qa-unprocessed="false" data-qa-placeholder="false" id="C099JF8RR7T-1757093613.501129-thread-list-Thread_1757093654.334059" tabindex="0" aria-setsize="-1" data-item-key="1757093654.334059"> <div dir="auto"> <p>“Right, so, looking at the comments, I’m seeing people ask every so often about the third entry in the [<i data-stringify-type="italic">FF7</i>]&nbsp;<i data-stringify-type="italic">Remake</i> series,” said Nomura. “Apparently, [<em>FF7</em> co-director Motomu] Toriyama mentioned in an interview that something might be released around the second anniversary [of <i data-stringify-type="italic">Ever Crisis</i>]. So that’s probably where those expectations are coming from. Right, so things are progressing really smoothly. I can’t really say more—if I suddenly went, ‘Well, actually…,’ everyone would be really surprised!”</p> </div>  <div dir="auto"> <p>He then added: “So yeah, things are moving along really smoothly, and the release timing has already been decided. We’re moving forward according to that schedule right now, so please rest assured and be patient.”</p> </div> </div>  <p>And don’t worry, fans of <em>Kingdom Hearts</em>, Nomura also had a small update about the Disney RPG, which was first announced back in 2022.</p>  <p>“And this has also come up in the comments here and there, but <i data-stringify-type="italic">Kingdom Hearts IV</i>&nbsp;is likewise steadily moving forward according to schedule, so please look forward to it.”</p>  <p>While this is good to hear, I imagine a lot of folks want a release window for one or both of these RPGs. <em>FF7 Remake’</em>s third entry will be its last, <a href="https://kotaku.com/final-fantasy-ff7-vii-remake-trilogy-rebirth-square-eni-1849074004">as confirmed by Square Enix in 2022</a>. We still don’t know when it’s coming, what it will be named, and what platforms it will launch on, though I expect PS5 players will be able to play it day one. Meanwhile, we’ve heard very little about <em>Kingdom Hearts 4</em>, though we did get <a href="https://kotaku.com/kingdom-hearts-4-screenshots-mickey-sora-release-date-1851780809">a new, very low-res screenshot earlier this year of Mickey Mouse in a library.</a> Hopefully, that and Nomura’s assurance that everything is progressing as planned will be enough for folks until the next update.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Fans Are Trying To Crack A Cryptic, Unlisted Cyberpunk 2077 Video]]></title>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><i>Cyberpunk 2077</i> isn’t without its unsolved mysteries. Between the seemingly <a href="https://kotaku.com/cyberpunk-2077-ff06b5-statue-code-mystery-netflix-anime-1849732254">unsolved FF06B5 enigma</a> and the lasting impact of <a href="https://kotaku.com/cyberpunk-2077-peralez-quest-jefferson-dream-on-choice-1849787559">cryptic quests like the Peralez storyline</a>, plenty of cybersleuths are still hard at work on the streets of Night City trying to uncover the game’s secrets. Fittingly, A recent social media post by official <i>Cyberpunk</i> accounts has led fans on another strange quest for truth, and it centers a strange, unlisted video that, at first glance, looks to be just 24 minutes of uninterrupted static.</p> <p>On September 1, 2025, <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/cyberpunk.net/post/3lxrrdgn3w22h">CD Projekt Red shared an image</a> of an in-universe recruitment message from Rosalind Myers, president of <i>Cyberpunk</i>’s fictional NUSA (New United States of America). Over at the decaying corpse of Twitter known as X, the official <i>Cyberpunk 2077</i> account <a href="https://x.com/CyberpunkGame/status/1962930885935714594">threw cold water</a> on any notion that this post was a teaser for new content, clarifying that it was simply “part of an activity tied to the <i>Phantom Liberty</i> anniversary [the studio’s] celebrating this month.” But fans convinced there was something more to this message were on to something.</p>   <p>As documented by ArcticXWolf on Reddit, the binary of the image had a link that <a href="https://cyberpunk.cdn.cdpr.app/files/wigvixQWK.png">points to an image of a Roman coin</a>. Using the anonymous messaging platform secretMSG, the link redirects to the unlisted YouTube video mentioned earlier,&nbsp; titled “Secret Message from NUSA,” which seemingly contains nothing more than 24 minutes and 53 seconds of static. Despite my affinity for avant-garde works of art, even I don’t think it’s very pleasant to listen to.</p>

  <p>Things get a little weird from here on out. Select frames from this video can be seen to spell out the words “FILES DETECTED CLASSIFIED.” Unfortunately, this seems to be the last concrete, provable thing anyone’s sussed out thus far. Some have <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/FF06B5/comments/1n93v8f/a_secret_message_from_the_nusa_static_video_isnt/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button">turned to LLMs for help</a>–which (shocker!) isn’t turning up anything meaningful. Others have pointed to a possible similarity between this cryptic static video and <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/FF06B5/comments/1n7skjz/comment/nc9wcza/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button">something apparently hidden</a> in <a href="https://kotaku.com/cyberpunk-edgerunners-season-2-netflix-studio-trigger-1851785703">the <i>Edgerunners 2</i> teaser</a>, which may or may not have something to do with <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/FF06B5/comments/1n7skjz/comment/nca6b2h/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button"><i>Cyberpunk</i>’s space-exploration-themed conspiracies</a>. And yet another well-read fan <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/FF06B5/comments/1n8azmn/comment/nce1a8u/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button">quoted the opening line</a> of William Gibson’s classic cyberpunk novel <i>Neuromancer</i>:</p> <blockquote><p>“The sky above the port was the color of television, tuned to a dead channel.”</p></blockquote> <p>Spooky stuff! The cryptic video remains unlisted and no social media accounts from <i>Cyberpunk 2077</i> or CD Projekt Red actually seem to have given any more clues. <i>Cyberpunk 2077</i>’s stories are often at their best when there’s a mystery to unravel, so this is cool and on-brand. Now hopefully someone figures this one out, as well as whatever the hell the true meaning of FF06B5 is.</p>
