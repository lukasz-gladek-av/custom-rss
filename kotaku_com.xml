Still, it is fun to walk into a room and shoot 20 random thugs with a big pistol. So that’s something. </p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="197589" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="Ring Psychology: Understanding The 6 Phases Of A Wrestling Match Through Heel Era John Cena" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="659" data-playlist="197589,197586,197585" data-current="197589"><div><p>Ring Psychology: Understanding The 6 Phases Of A Wrestling Match Through Heel Era John Cena</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197589/197589_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197589/197589_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197589/197589_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/23110.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/best-robocop-game-rogue-city-sequel-expansion-2025-pc-1851768472&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/best-robocop-game-rogue-city-sequel-expansion-2025-pc-1851768472"><em>Unfinished Business</em></a></span><em> </em>opens in a really depressing way. Set after the events of the last game, it kicks off with an attack on the police station—which served as one of your central hubs in <em>Rogue City—</em>that leaves many of the NPCs from that game dead. A few of the main characters from the movies, like Officer Lewis, survive, point RoboCop in the direction of a big tower filled with mercenaries who were likely responsible, and then don’t show up again for hours and hours. It’s like<em> Unfinished Business</em> wants to remind players of the more varied world and characters of the last game before it dumps you into the boring corridors of OmniTower. </p><p>Once in OmniTower, <em>Unfinished Business</em> tasks you with reaching the upper levels of the massive structure. But between RoboCop and his goal are hundreds of bots and mercs ready to kill the shiny hero. While<em> Rogue City</em> featured plenty of first-person combat,<em> Unfinished Business</em> features loads more. This is  mostly an action game, whereas the last one could be charitably described as a low-budget spin on a Bethesda game.</p><p>Thankfully, gunning down creeps and saving hostages is still a blast in <em>Unfinished Business</em>. And a few new weapons, along with the ability to use the environment to take down baddies—like shoving someone down a garbage chute—help spice things up. But I really hope you liked the shooty-shooty bits from <em>Rogue City</em> because <em>Unfinished Business</em> is mostly that. </p><p>In <em>Rogue City</em>, I fell in love with a little slice of Old Detroit as I patrolled it, completed side missions, met various characters, and helped protect them. That’s all gone in <em>Unfinished Business</em>. There are still side quests and characters to meet, but most of them are left behind between levels as you keep moving up. Instead of a small slice of urban decay that you can grow to love, <em>Unfinished Business</em> gives you oh so many grey corridors and rooms. Thanks? </p><p>All the RPG systems from<em> Rogue City</em> are back in <em>Unfinished Business,</em> which does help add more to this game and keep it from being just a straight-up linear shooter, but compared to what came before, it’s disappointing. A few moments where you get to play as a pre-RoboCop Alex Murphy are neat, but don’t add much to the experience. </p><p>Hopefully, the devs behind <em>Unfinished Business</em> and <em>Rogue City </em>have a proper sequel in the works that brings back the open-world RPG formula that made that last game so charming and memorable. </p><p> .<br></p></div></div><br/><br/>https://kotaku.com/robocop-rogue-city-unfinished-business-expansion-review-1851786534]]></content:encoded>
