But the team has gotten pretty good at detecting cheaters and banning their accounts. </p><p>One interesting stat that Chess.com’s Fair Play team shared in the blog post is that nearly 40 percent of closed accounts are less than two weeks old. This means the team’s methods of finding and punishing naughty players and bots are doing a solid job of catching cheaters early. But Chess.com thinks it can do an even better job at keeping cheaters out. </p><p>“One of the ways we’re tackling this phenomenon is by screening players more frequently early in their journey on the platform,” said Chess.com’s Fair Play team. “This means we’re generating reports for players that essentially serve as checkpoints as they play more games. It is entirely reasonable (and expected) that it may take time for someone to establish their rating, so these checkpoints go beyond games played and rating earned, but also include strength of play and over 100 other gameplay factors.”</p><p>The team also shared that it uses algorithms to look out for extraordinary examples of cheating or inhuman behavior. With only 30 people watching and 20 million games a day, it makes sense that the team would need extra help. All of this is in service of making sure most players who hop onto Chess.com have a good time.

Now this storyline and Malkovich’s performance have been cut from the final film.</p><p>“It was heartbreaking not to include him in the final version of the movie because he’s one of my very favorite humans and one of my biggest inspirations,” Shakman said. “As a person who walks the line between theater and film and television, there’s no one who is more inspiring than the founder of Steppenwolf Theater Company. What he’s done on stage as an actor and what he’s done as a director in theater as well as in film, and as just a film actor of incredible ability — I was honored he came to play.”</p><p>Maybe we’ll see this cut segment in a director’s cut or special features when the movie ends up on streaming. It’s also entirely possible Red Ghost appears in a future MCU movie. It would be a shame to have an actor of Malkovich’s caliber and just waste him on deleted scenes. <em>Fantastic Four: First Steps </em><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/fantastic-4-first-steps-pedro-pascal-mr-fantastic-reed-1851786015&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/fantastic-4-first-steps-pedro-pascal-mr-fantastic-reed-1851786015">comes to theaters on July 25</a></span>.</p></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://kotaku.com/fantastic-four-first-steps-john-malkovich-red-ghost-cut-1851786444]]></content:encoded>

It details an alleged ramping-up of efforts by Krafton to delay<em> Subanutica 2</em>'s planned 2025 release in order to avoid triggering provisions from the October 2021 sale of the studio that would lead to a $250 million bonus payout if certain sales goals were met through early 2026. </p><p>According to the lawsuit, the terms of that agreement prohibited Krafton from firing any of the founders without cause or interfering in the studio’s business in any way that might impact that payout. Unknown Worlds would “maintain operational control of the Group companies in all material respects, including (for both existing and new products) product roadmap, launch, planning, partnering, budgeting and employee matters” as long as at least one of the cofounders remained employed there. </p><p>The founders claim the business relationship didn’t begin going south until earlier this year when projections for <em>Subnautica 2</em>'s sales were shared with Krafton management, one of which showed them hitting the targets required for the $250 million payout. “During the first week of April 2025, Unknown Worlds’ publishing colleagues in Krafton’s El Segundo, California office traveled to Korea to finalize the marketing and advertising strategy for <em>Subnautica 2</em>’s launch,” the lawsuit reads. “Upon their return, the El Segundo team—Krafton employees—reported to Gill that Krafton’s leadership was not focused on a successful launch, but instead on how it could convince Unknown Worlds to delay the game.”</p><p> Things came to a head in a May 2025 milestone review, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/subnautica-2-delay-lawsuit-leaks-biomes-steam-krafton-1851786101&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/subnautica-2-delay-lawsuit-leaks-biomes-steam-krafton-1851786101">portions of which leaked online last week</a></span>, in which Krafton argued the game needed more content and development time against the recommendation of the founders. From there, the founders alleged that Krafton began trying to sabotage the launch by locking down all publishing resources, failing to respond to emails with third-party partners, and claiming control over the final release date decision. </p><p>“One of Krafton’s El Segundo publishing employees reported to Gill that Krafton Headquarters told all Krafton teams to stop all creative tasks related to <em>Subnautica 2</em>,” the lawsuit reads. “The employee’s supervisor even demanded that he and his team cease communication with Unknown Worlds altogether.”</p><p>Then in June, according to the lawsuit, Krafton tried to get Cleveland, McGuire, and Gill to take a lower payout while also claiming that the founders were failing in their contractual obligations to the company. “On June 25, 2025, Krafton’s Head of Corporate Development told Gill that Krafton’s plan was to remove the Unknown Worlds board and fire the Founders,” the lawsuit reads.</p><p> “She warned Gill that ‘the lawyers are ready to go.’” They were fired roughly a week later, with termination letters from Striking Distance Studios CEO Steve Papoutsis, who has since taken over Unknown Worlds, blaming the founders’ “intention to proceed with a premature release of<em> Subnautica 2</em>.” According to the lawsuit, the firings were made “without cause,” and Krafton even went so far as to offer them their “post-termination payments and benefits” for being terminated “without cause.” </p><p>The lawsuit concludes:</p><blockquote data-type="BlockQuote"><p>In short, Krafton flagrantly breached both the letter and the spirit of the promises at the very core of its agreement to purchase Unknown Worlds. It promised to leave creative and operational control in the hands of the Founders. Promise broken. It promised to consult with the Founders before taking any action that could harm the earnout. Promise broken. It promised not to take any action with the primary business purpose of frustrating the earnout. Promise broken. And it promised not to terminate the Founders without Cause. Promise broken.</p></blockquote><p>The founders’ side of the story comes after weeks of vague statements on Reddit and confusing press releases from Krafton, who has argued that the founders were fired for failing to get <em>Subnautica 2</em> ready for a successful Early Access release. In particular, the leaked milestone review points to concerns that a lack of biomes and story content would result in the game failing to meet player expectations for a sequel. It’s denied that the prospective payout, 10 percent of which was due to some of Unknown Worlds’ roughly 100 developers, had anything to do with the management shakeup. </p><p>Caught in the middle are those working on the game who still need to deliver it, one way or the other. With <em>Subnautica 2 </em>now coming out in 2026, Krafton has promised employees that it will extend the bonus payout window to make up for the delay as well as advance them money from next year’s profit-sharing pool, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-07-15/krafton-extends-subnautica-2-bonus-period-is-sued-by-founders?accessToken=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJzb3VyY2UiOiJTdWJzY3JpYmVyR2lmdGVkQXJ0aWNsZSIsImlhdCI6MTc1MjYwOTQyNSwiZXhwIjoxNzUzMjE0MjI1LCJhcnRpY2xlSWQiOiJTWkdJMVNUMEcxS1cwMCIsImJjb25uZWN0SWQiOiJCMUVBQkI5NjQ2QUM0REZFQTJBRkI4MjI1MzgyQTJFQSJ9.eu_sHgKRf9uj-U3I1UDNgrJnNjE39Q3OcbLzDsn2xWY&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-07-15/krafton-extends-subnautica-2-bonus-period-is-sued-by-founders?accessToken=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJzb3VyY2UiOiJTdWJzY3JpYmVyR2lmdGVkQXJ0aWNsZSIsImlhdCI6MTc1MjYwOTQyNSwiZXhwIjoxNzUzMjE0MjI1LCJhcnRpY2xlSWQiOiJTWkdJMVNUMEcxS1cwMCIsImJjb25uZWN0SWQiOiJCMUVBQkI5NjQ2QUM0REZFQTJBRkI4MjI1MzgyQTJFQSJ9.eu_sHgKRf9uj-U3I1UDNgrJnNjE39Q3OcbLzDsn2xWY" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>Bloomberg</em> reported</a></span>.

So that makes a “reveal” trailer kind of boring and unnecessary. This is <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/fifa-soccer-ea-games-sports-fc-franchise-pro-evolution-1848905860&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/fifa-soccer-ea-games-sports-fc-franchise-pro-evolution-1848905860">the series that used to be called <em>FIFA</em></a></span><em> </em>and makes <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://variety.com/2024/gaming/news/ea-sports-fc-electronic-arts-earnings-1235890705/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://variety.com/2024/gaming/news/ea-sports-fc-electronic-arts-earnings-1235890705/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">EA hundreds of millions of dollars every year</a></span>. Of course, we all knew there was going to be an <em>EA Sports FC 26. </em>The question then becomes: How do you get people to pay attention to your reveal trailer and hopefully win back fans who <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/games/ea-sports-fc-25&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/games/ea-sports-fc-25">weren’t happy about last year’s entry</a></span>? The answer: Directly address their complaints in a fun way. </p><p>Here’s the trailer, which is filled with complaints about last year’s game being too slow, not reactive enough, or lacking other important features. And EA confidently offers a solution or improvement for each one. </p><p> “<em>FC 26</em> reflects our ongoing commitment to building this game with and for our community,” said EA Sports exec John Sheppard. “We are players too, and that shared passion drives everything we do. This year brings an overhauled gameplay experience, new Tournaments and Live Events in FUT, all-new Archetype customization in Clubs, and a Career Mode that comes alive through evolving Challenges. We can’t wait for players to feel the difference this September and help shape the future of <em>FC</em>.”</p><p>Now, while we hope the game turns out great, it remains possible that when players get their hands on <em>EA Sports FC 26</em> on September 26, they won’t be happy with what EA has done. But at the very least, I’ll give EA credit for poking fun at itself and offering up a trailer that is unique and memorable. </p><p> .<br></p></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://kotaku.com/fc-26-fifa-trailer-reveal-complaints-soccer-ea-sports-1851786431]]></content:encoded>
