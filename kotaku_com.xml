            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Digital picture frames fix the problem of printed photos collecting dust in albums that no one ever opens: They turn your favorite memories into a display that changes every day and is seen by everyone. With modern WiFi-enabled frames, family members can send photos from anywhere using a simple app which means that grandparents can get pictures of their grandkids right away without having to know how to use cloud storage or email attachments.</p>
<p>The 10.1-inch frame from <em>Euphro</em> makes everything easier with a touchscreen interface that anyone can use, even if they’ve never owned a smartphone or tablet. The <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6098/">Cyber Monday sale brought the price down from the usual $99 to $45</a> which is the lowest price ever on Amazon. That discount makes sense for a frame that has a lot of storage, a clear display, and easy photo sharing, all in a package that anyone can use without any technical knowledge.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6098/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>WiFi Sharing That Works and Isn’t Confusing</h2>
<p>The <strong>frame connects to your home’s Wi-Fi network</strong> through a simple setup process that shows you how to do it on the touchscreen. Once it’s connected, anyone you give permission to can send photos through the free <em>Uhale</em> app which is available for both iPhone and Android devices. Family members can easily get to your frame by downloading the app, making an account and asking for access with a unique code and you can then approve their request with just one tap. When you send photos through the app, they show up on the frame right away: This is the magical moment when grandma sees her grandson’s first day of school photos pop up in real time from hundreds of miles away.</p>



<p>The <strong>10.1-inch IPS touchscreen has a resolution of 1280×800</strong> which is enough to show photos clearly without the blurry, pixelated look that cheaper frames give. IPS technology keeps the colors true and bright even when you look at the screen from the side. Older LCD panels would wash out if you weren’t standing right in front of them. You can pause the slideshow to look at a favorite photo or skip over pictures you’ve seen recently with the touch interface, which responds smoothly to swipes and taps. Depending on how you set it up, you can turn the frame from portrait to landscape mode.</p>
<p>The <strong>internal storage can hold up to 32GB, which is enough for about 60,000 photos</strong> at the resolution of a typical smartphone so you’ll run out of wall space before you run out of memory. The <strong>frame can also take microSD cards</strong>&nbsp;but most people never get close to filling up the internal storage, even after years of regular photo uploads. You can send files directly from cameras, phones, or computers without having to worry about compatibility issues because JPEG, PNG, and MP4 files are just a few of the many image and video formats that work without conversion.</p>



<p>You can change how photos look by changing the order they show up in, the speed of the slideshow, and the transition effects between images. If some photos don’t fit the season or mood, you can hide them from the rotation. The frame will remember these settings until you change them. You can set the display order to show the newest photos first, shuffle them randomly, or play them in order of when they were taken.</p>
<p>Cutting the price by $54 makes this frame cheap enough to buy on a whim, and it has features that frames that cost twice as much have a hard time matching.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[JBL Loses All Margin This Black Friday Week, 5.1-Channel Soundbar Crashes to an All-Time Low]]></title>
            <link>https://kotaku.com/jbl-soundbar-and-subwoofer-for-150-off-2000638894</link>
            <guid>1368199</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>You should want the best out of your home entertainment setup. And that doesn’t just mean investing in a good TV for video quality. You’ve got to give audio some love too. Sure, a fancy 85-kinch OLED smart TV is going to look awesome in your living room, and while built-in TV speaker have gotten better over the years, they still don’t hold a candle to a dedicated surround sound system. This JBL soundbar and subwoofer combo offer a great improvement to your home entertainment soundscape without you needing to empty your bank account. And best of all, it’s on sale right now. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6095/">Normally the JBL Bar 500 goes for $650, but for a limited time deal for Black Friday week, you can get it for just $400.</a></p>
<p>This JBL soundbar measures across at exactly 101.7 centimeters. That can comfortably fit atop your media center right in front of your TV. The subwoofer works wirelessly, which means you don’t need to hide cables running from one side of the room to the other. That measures 10 inches high and will be the difference between a bass that booms and a bass that&nbsp;<strong>BOOMS</strong>.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6095/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<p>With support for both Dolby Atmos and MultiBeam surround sound, you can bring theater-like quality sound and feels like it’s coming from all directions in a 3D space, fully immersing your in the audio. And it does so without actually needing any additional surround sound speakers — just the 5.1-channnel&nbsp; system.</p>
<h2>Enhanced Dialogue</h2>
<p>Now one of the main reasons to upgrade to a soundbar over your TV’s built-in speakers is dialogue. TV shows and movies nowadays have a tendency to be mixed with more robust audio setups in mind. This is why when playing off just your TV speakers, you might sometimes find it hard to actually make out what anyone is saying. However, if you go to increase the volume, suddenly the next scene has erratically loud sound effects like explosions, gun fire, or even just background music.</p>



<p>The JBL 500 sound bar gives you the option to enhance dialogue separately from the rest of the audio. PureVoice Dialogue Enhancements algorithmically isolates and amplifies vocal clarity so that you don’t feel forced to always watch with the subtitles turned on.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6095/">Tons of other smart features are packed into the JBL Bar 500 soundbar and subwoofer.</a> With Wi-Fi support, you can connect to your sound system from other devices on your network. Stream music to them over AirPlay from an iPhone or MacBook. You can even pair the soundbar with an Alexa smart home hub can control the speaker with voice commands.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Amazon Quietly Moves Its Remaining 15.6″ Portable Gaming Monitor Stock Into Record-Low Clearance After 10K+ Black Friday Sales]]></title>
            <link>https://kotaku.com/15-6-inch-kyy-portable-gaming-monitor-2000644924</link>
            <guid>1368178</guid>

              <p>A single screen can often feel limited, especially if you’re someone who needs to work with multiple applications at the same time. Those who use a laptop as their main work or play device can benefit from adding a second, portable display to their setup, and today is a great time to bring one home.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6084/">Amazon is currently offering quite a few impressive Cyber Monday deals, which also drops the price of the 15.6-inch KYY portable monitor to just $66.</a> That’s after a 34% discount on its $100 price tag, and the offer is open to all shoppers. Both Prime and non-Prime members can take advantage of it. Though it’s best to get your orders in fast, as we’re expecting the discount to wrap up soon.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6084/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Multiple Display Modes for All Your Needs</h2>
<p>In a sleek, lightweight build, you’re getting a nice 15.6-inch screen. The size is similar to what most standard laptops offer, so you won’t feel a drastic difference when switching between both. The same goes for the visuals. The portable monitor offers a 1920×1080 resolution, which translates into brighter colors and sharper details. The advanced IPS matte screen supports a 178-degree full viewing angle, meaning you can enjoy consistent visuals from all directions. Basically, you don’t have to sit directly in front of the screen to view the content. This is great for when you have multiple people around; those at the back or on the side will be able to see just as clearly.</p>



<p>You can choose between multiple display modes (including mirror, extend, second screen only, and portrait mode), depending on what you need. Need to run two programs side by side? The extended mode gives you access to both. Reading through long documents? Portrait mode should work best!</p>
<p>The monitor includes two fully functional USB-C ports, which means you can connect it with just a single cable for both power and display, as long as your device supports Thunderbolt 3 or USB-C with DisplayPort Alt Mode. The setup is plug-and-play, so you don’t need to worry about installing any complicated drivers to get started.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6084/">Even better, it comes with a smart cover that not just protects it from everyday wear and tear, but also doubles as a stand you can use to prop the monitor up</a>. In short, if you have been wanting to expand your work or play setup with something that’s easy to carry around, this portable monitor can be a valuable addition.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Dyson V11 Reached 20K Units Sold This Week, Amazon Goes Even Lower With New All-Time Price for Cyber Monday]]></title>
            <link>https://kotaku.com/dyson-v11-reached-20k-units-sold-this-week-amazon-goes-even-lower-with-new-all-time-price-for-cyber-monday-2000648745</link>
            <guid>1368163</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Dyson comes out with a new vacuum model almost every year, and the V11 is a big step up in the brand’s cordless line with 185 air watts of suction that makes a real difference on both carpets and hard floors.</p>
<p>On Cyber Monday weekend, <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4478/">the price dropped from $629 to $399 which is a new all-time low</a> for a model that still competes with Dyson’s newest models. That discount is important because you’re getting tech that was top-of-the-line just a few years ago, but now it’s priced more like mid-range competitors that can’t match its suction power, autonomy or build quality.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4478/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Three Power Modes</h2>
<p>You can switch between three different power settings on the V11 using a button on the handle and it lets you control how much battery life you give up for cleaning power.<em> Auto mode</em> uses sensors in the cleaner head to figure out what kind of floor it is and changes the suction automatically. It increases suction on carpets and decreases it on hard floors to save battery life while still cleaning well. <strong>Eco mode extends runtime by up to 60 minutes</strong> by lowering suction to its lowest effective level. This is great for quick daily cleaning of hard surfaces that don’t need maximum power. When you turn on <em>boost mode</em>, it gives you the full 185 air watts for a few minutes of deep cleaning.</p>



<p>The <strong>LCD screen on top of the vacuum shows you what power mode you’re in</strong>, how much time is left until it runs out, and maintenance alerts when the filters need to be cleaned or there are blockages. This real-time feedback takes away the guesswork that comes with other cordless vacuums. You won’t have to wonder if you have enough power to finish the room or if the loss of suction means a clog or just a full bin.</p>
<p>The Motorbar cleaner head has a <strong>brush bar that spins and has technology that keeps long hair and pet fur from getting stuck</strong> in the bristles: This means you don’t have to spend as much time cutting up tangles off the roller with scissors. The brush bar works on all kinds of floors without needing to be adjusted by hand and it moves smoothly from area rugs to tile to hardwood while still cleaning well.</p>



<p>It only takes a <strong>few seconds to switch the vacuum to handheld mode</strong> by removing the wand and connecting tools directly to the motor body. This makes it a powerful tool for cleaning furniture, stairs, and car interiors. The mini soft dusting brush can clean delicate surfaces and electronics without scratching them, and the crevice tool can get into baseboards and tight corners that regular vacuum heads can’t reach.</p>
<p>Advanced <strong>HEPA filtration catches 99.99% of particles as small as 0.3 microns</strong> which includes common allergens like dust mites, pollen, and pet dander that can make people allergic. The sealed filtration system makes sure that the air that comes out of the vacuum cleaner is cleaner than the air that goes in and it is a big help for people with asthma or allergies.</p>
<p>Dyson offers a<strong> two-year warranty on the V11</strong> and <strong>lifetime support through their app</strong> which has maintenance guides and troubleshooting help when problems come up. The vacuum is only 6.6 pounds when fully assembled, which makes it light enough to carry up the stairs without any trouble but heavy enough to handle daily use. The docking station that hangs on the wall charges the battery and keeps the vacuum and tools in one neat place so you don’t have to search through closets to find them.</p>
<p>Taking $230 off the price of a Dyson vacuum is a great deal, especially for a model that still works as well as vacuums that cost a lot more.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Star Wars Outlaws (Gold Edition) for Nintendo Switch 2 at 50% Off Could Sell Out Before Cyber Monday Even Arrives]]></title>
            <link>https://kotaku.com/star-wars-outlaws-gold-edition-for-nintendo-switch-2-already-half-price-for-black-friday-2000648499</link>
            <guid>1368160</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Game prices have been a hot topic of conversation surrounding the Nintendo Switch 2. <em>Mario Kart World</em>, the first launch title for the console, comes with an outlandish $80 price tag. Nintendo’s favorite ape has taken centerstage once more in <em>Donkey Kong: Bananza</em>, priced at $70. Third party titles seem to be sticking with the standard $60 for the time being. Those also tend to actually go on sale unlike first party Nintendo titles (which do, but far less frequently and with far less substantial discounts). <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6083/">So right now during Black Friday weekend, it’s pretty expected to find these Nintendo games are still full price while an awesome title like&nbsp;<em>Star Wars Outlaws&nbsp;</em>has come down by 50%.</a></p>
<p>Previously unavailable on Nintendo consoles, <em>Star Wars Outlaws</em> first arrived in 2024 on the PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X|S, and PC. With the launch of the Switch 2, Nintendo is now able to supports a lot more graphically-demanding third party titles. We’ve seen Nintendo Switch 2 releases for <em>Cyberpunk 2077</em>, <em>Street Fighter 6</em>, and now <em>Star Wars Outlaws&nbsp;</em>too.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6083/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<p><em>Star Wars Outlaws&nbsp;</em>came to the Nintendo Switch 2 back in the beginning of September, selling at a full retail price of $60. Now, just a couple short months later, it’s down to just $30—for a limited time at least. Through Black Friday, you come discover this galaxy of opportunities and experience Star Wars from the scoundrel’s perspective for just $30.</p>
<h2>Gold Edition: Base Game &amp; More</h2>
<p>This is the Gold Edition of the game. That means comes with the Star Wars Outlaws season pass including, not one, but two story DLCs. The pack includes the base game along with the Wild Card story pack, A Pirate’s Fortune story pack, Jabba’s Gambit exclusive Day 1 mission, The Kessel Runner character pack, The Hunter’s Legacy bundle, and The Cartel Ronin bundle.</p>



<p>In <em>Star Wars Outlaws</em>, you live the high-stake life of an outlaw in Star Wars’ first-ever open world action-adventure. Play as scoundrel Kay Vess and you seek freedom and a new life for yourself. Overcome enemies through stealth, gadgets, and your trusty blaster. Pilot a ship—the Trailblazer—as you embark in thrilling dogfights with the Empire and other foes you’ll make along the way.</p>
<p>Cities are bustling with interesting characters and cantinas to explore. In each location, you’ll find new challenges with exciting rewards waiting for the taking.&nbsp;Every choice you make effects your in-game reputation, which can have consequences for your story and your character down the line.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6083/"><em>Star Wars Outlaws</em> for the Nintendo Switch 2 supports all modes of play—TV mode, tabletop mode, and handheld mode.</a> This version of the game clocks in at about 20GB which is about a third the size it is one other consoles. It runs in 720p in handheld mode and 1440p when docked at 60fps.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Seagate Goes Zero-Profit on 2TB External Hard Drive, 500,000 Photo Storage at New Record Low]]></title>
            <link>https://kotaku.com/seagate-goes-zero-profit-on-2tb-external-hard-drive-500000-photo-storage-at-new-record-low-2000648741</link>
            <guid>1368145</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Cloud storage sounds great until you realize you’ll have to pay monthly fees forever and hope your internet connection stays strong when you need to get to something important. External hard drives solve both problems by letting you physically control your files without having to pay for them over and over again. Plus,<strong> with 2TB of space, you can store about 500,000 photos or hundreds of hours of video</strong> before you even think about running out of space.</p>
<p>Because it works right away with almost any device you own and only needs a USB cable to start transferring files, Seagate’s portable drive has become one of Amazon’s most popular storage options. This Black Friday weekend, <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3788/">the price of the 2TB model dropped from $79 to $64, which is the lowest it’s ever been</a> for a drive that is always one of the best-selling in its category.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3788/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Storage That Works Everywhere</h2>
<p>The drive connects through USB 3.0 which in <strong>real-world tests speeds up transfers to 120MB per second</strong>&nbsp;which means that moving a full movie file takes less than a minute instead of the slow speed you’d have to deal with with older USB 2.0 connections.</p>
<p>You can also plug it<strong> right into Windows PCs, Macs, PlayStation consoles, or Xbox systems</strong> without having to install drivers or reformat it in most cases because is because Seagate ships the drive with broad compatibility already set up. People who use Macs may need to reformat their drives for Time Machine backups, but this only takes a few clicks, and once you set it up, the drive does backups automatically without any problems.</p>



<p>The <strong>metal case protects the device well from small drops and bumps</strong>&nbsp;but if you’re putting it in a backpack with other gear, you should get a padded case. Seagate offers a <strong>one-year rescue service</strong> that includes data recovery in case the drive fails which gives you peace of mind because professional recovery services usually cost hundreds of dollars and can’t always guarantee results.</p>
<p>The<strong> USB connection provides power directly so you don’t need a separate power adapter</strong> that could get lost in a drawer or make your desk look messy. You can use this drive anywhere there is a USB port like in coffee shops or airport lounges, without having to look for an outlet. The drive spins at 5400 RPM which is a good balance between speed and reliability and it also uses very little power so it can be used with laptops without draining the battery.</p>



<p>This drive can be used as <strong>extra storage for PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Xbox One, and Xbox Series X systems</strong> that fill up their internal storage faster than you can delete old games. You can store PS4 and Xbox One games on the drive and play them right away without having to copy them back to the console’s internal storage. However, you have to transfer PS5 and Series X games back to the console’s SSD before you can play them.</p>
<p>For $64, you can get 2TB of reliable storage that is $20 to $50 less than most other drives. Plus, you get Seagate’s reputation for durability and a rescue service, so you don’t have to worry about buying an unknown brand. The price works out to about 3 cents per gigabyte, which is better than cloud storage subscriptions after just a few months of use.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/black-friday-drops-legos-jurassic-world-dinosaur-fossils-t-rex-skull-by-38-2000648149</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Have little ones who can’t get enough of dinosaurs? Surprising them with a buildable T. rex skull is going to light them up instantly, and today is a great time to pick one up.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6082/">LEGO’s Jurassic World Dinosaur Fossils: T Rex Skull building set, which gets you a posable T. rex skull, plus a fossilized footprint with a plaque, is currently sitting at just $25 on Amazon.</a> That’s after a 38% discount on its retail price of $40, and the price is the lowest we have seen in quite some time. It’s a Cyber Monday deal, and the holiday rush is going to set in quickly. We recommend grabbing it fast, as the offer (or the stock) is likely going to end soon.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6082/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Display Worthy</h2>
<p>This fun set is made for ages 9 and up, and gets you a total of 577 pieces. It’s not going to be one of those massive projects that require week-long dedication, and won’t be a super quick job either. Think of it as a fun little weekend activity that your kids can begin on a Saturday and be done with by Sunday.</p>
<p>Attention to detail is truly impressive. You’ll be building a fairly realistic dino toy; a T. rex skull with dinosaur bones that sits on a display stand. You can choose to keep the jaws open for a scary look or close them when letting the beast rest. The skull is paired with the fossilized footprint, plus a plaque that displays some cool facts about the Tyrannosaurus. Kids can learn about the height of the giant, its weight, dietary preferences, and more as they build. There’s a hidden amber piece added somewhere in there to add a little mystery for the curious minds, too. Finish off by adding some LEGO plants around for a foresty feel.</p>



<p>Once made, the set measures over 8 in. (21 cm) high. Place it on a shelf in the living room, or in the kids’ play area; it’s going to look stunning everywhere. You can display the skull, amber, and footprint in different ways. It’s going to look great on its own, and even pair it with other Jurassic World kits for a fuller setup.</p>
<p>Like all LEGO sets, this too comes with a detailed instruction manual. The guidebook takes you through each step, and is pretty easy to follow. But for additional assistance, you can install the LEGO Builder app, as well. The platform offers 3D instructions, plus lets you zoom in on the blocks from each angle to get a better understanding. Kids can save all their sets, track progress, and even build with friends!</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6082/">This deal lets you grab it for just $25, which is basically nothing for the experience the set offers</a>. Now is a great time to bring one, or even two of these home for the little dino lovers in your life without blowing your budget. That said, there’s plenty more going at a discount right now. Black Friday is over, but you can still pick everything from kitchen essentials to high-ticket items like TVs, smart home devices, tech gadgets, and more without paying the full price. Just note that most discounts are short-lived. If you see something you like, don’t wait too long to grab it.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>If you want to modernize your home without getting rid of all your old appliances, traditional stores can be very frustrating. A <strong>smart plug is great because it turns any regular appliance into a connected device</strong> without you having to buy expensive smart versions of everything: You don’t need to spend $200 on a smart lamp when you can use a simple plug to make your $30 lamp respond to voice commands and set routines. But the good news is that during Black Friday, <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5877/">Amazon’s smart plug goes down to $12 for Black Friday, which is less than its usual price of $24</a>. This looks like a move by Amazon to<strong> get more homes connected to Alexa</strong> without making any money.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5877/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Voice Control at a Reasonable Price</h2>
<p>The Amazon smart plug controls the flow of electricity to whatever you plug into it: This means that <strong>any device that has a physical on/off switch can be controlled by Alexa</strong>: Your coffee maker can start brewing before you get out of bed, your lamp in the living room can turn on when you say <em>“Alexa, good morning,”</em> and the box fan in your bedroom can turn off by itself when you fall asleep. The<strong> plug connects directly to your Wi-Fi network</strong> so you don’t need to buy a separate smart home hub and it only takes a few minutes to set up through the Alexa app. Once it’s connected, the plug will automatically reconnect after a power outage or Wi-Fi problem.</p>



<p>The small size of 2.2 inches deep by 3.2 inches wide by 1.5 inches high k<strong>eeps your second outlet free</strong> for another plug or device. This is more important than you might think because a lot of smart plugs are too big to fit in both outlets so you have to choose which device to use. The plug works with any household item that runs on 120 volts, from table lamps and fans to coffee makers and holiday lights. You can also<strong> use the Alexa app to set up routines</strong> that link together different tasks: For example, when you say <em>“Alexa, I’m home,”</em> your entryway lights will turn on and your coffee maker will start.</p>
<p>You can control devices from anywhere in your home <strong>without getting up because the plug works with Alexa’s voice control system</strong>, and you can also control <strong>everything from the Alexa app when you’re not home</strong>. This lets you turn off devices you forgot about or make it look like someone is home while you’re away. You can set your lights to turn on at sunset or your fan to turn off after two hours without having to remember.</p>
<p>For $12, this is a great deal for making your current devices smart instead of buying expensive new ones that are already connected. A smart lamp usually costs $50 to $100 more than a regular lamp: With this plug, you can add the same features to any lamp you already own for a lot less money. Black Friday is the best time to buy them if you want to automate several outlets in your home without spending hundreds of dollars on separate smart devices.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/the-popular-bose-quietcomfort-noise-cancelling-headphones-are-back-to-its-lowest-price-ever-for-black-friday-2000648466</link>
            <guid>1368127</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p data-start="146" data-end="748">The holiday season is in full swing, with city streets glowing under festive winter lights and all of us eagerly searching for the perfect gifts for friends, family, and loved ones. Black Friday weekend has officially arrived, too, bringing some of the year’s most attractive deals on popular tech products. One standout offer on Amazon features a major discount on a top-rated pair of Bose headphones. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6081/">For a limited time, the Bose QuietComfort Bluetooth headphones are available at an impressive 43% off</a>. The price has dropped from the usual $349 to just $199, giving you a substantial $150 in savings.</p>
<p data-start="750" data-end="1214">People who spend lots of time on public transportation or endure frequent flights can really benefit tremendously from a solid pair of noise-canceling headphones. The Bose QuietComfort headphones can help you create a calm, focused soundscape by removing unwanted background noises. Enjoy you music, podcasts, audiobooks, or any other audio without being interrupted by the bustle of everyday life.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6081/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2 data-start="750" data-end="1214">How Does Noise Cancellation Work?</h2>
<p data-start="1216" data-end="1714">The underlying technology of noise cancellation is pretty ingenious. Built-in microphones positioned on the outside of the headphones listen to the sounds around you. The headphones then generate soundwaves that mirror incoming noise but invert those waves. When the original noise and the inverted signal meet, they effectively cancel each other out. This process reduces these distracting background noises significantly, leaving only the audio coming from your connected device.</p>
<p data-start="1716" data-end="2199">The Bose QuietComfort headphones offer two distinct listening modes: Quiet and Aware. Quiet mode engages full noise cancellation, ideal for situations where total focus is desired. Aware mode, on the other hand, allows outside sounds to flow through naturally. This option is good for when staying alert to one’s surroundings is important, like working in an office and someone might need to get your attention or when navigating busy areas where hearing traffic and other activity is key for your own safety.</p>


<p data-start="1716" data-end="2199">The plush padding of the over-ear cushions and headband are designed for all-day comfort—and you might even be finding yourself wearing them all day with the exceptional battery life.</p>
<p data-start="1716" data-end="2199">The headphones can provide a full 24 hours of listening time on a single charge. This will keep you able to listen to your favorite turns through your whole commute, entire work day, and commute home. If you every find yourself having forgotten to charge the headphones, no sweat. Plugging in the Bose QuietComfort headphones for just 15 minutes will grant you up to two and a half additional hours of playtime. The headphones charge over USB-C.</p>
<p data-start="2201" data-end="2672">The QuietComfort headphones come in a wide assortment of colors, so you can choose a style that suits your preference. Options include cypress green, chilled lilac, petal pink, twilight blue, sandstone, moonlight gray, white smoke, and a classic black. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6081/">All of these colors are priced at the discounted $199 level for Black Friday and Cyber Monday.</a></p>

            <title><![CDATA[Govee Speaker Lamp (Sound by JBL) Is Still Alive at Its Black Friday Price, Listen to ‘Golden’ With Music-Light Sync This Holiday]]></title>
            <link>https://kotaku.com/govee-table-lamp-2-pro-x-sound-by-jbl-2000648503</link>
            <guid>1368103</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p data-start="56" data-end="537">With Black Friday weekend finally here, you can save big across essentially every category of products. Whether you’re looking for a new espresso machine to treat yourself to barista-level lattes in the morning or if you’re hoping to snag a new 4K monitor for your gaming PC, now is the weekend to find what you’re looking for. If you’re just perusing the web this weekend for something you maybe don’t “need” but seems like a cool thing to have, this could be just the thing. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6080/">The Govee Table Lamp 2 Pro x Sound by JBL has come down by 25%.</a> This Bluetooth speaker and lightshow in one normally goes for $180, but Black Friday has it down to just $135. You end up saving yourself $45.</p>
<p data-start="56" data-end="537">Govee’s smart table lamp offers a fun way to mix both sound and light at your next party, synchronizing the light and color to the music playing through its speaker. The lamp’s integrated chipset and advanced algorithm allow it to respond to music in real-time with a 32ms response time. This ensures the lights stay in perfect sync with every beat, making your music come alive.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6080/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2 data-start="56" data-end="537">Set the Perfect Atmosphere</h2>
<p data-start="539" data-end="902">The lamp features 16 different music modes that adjust the lighting based on the rhythm of your music. You can switch between modes to match the mood, whether you’re hosting a lively party or trying to create a more relaxing vibe to wind down to.</p>
<p data-start="904" data-end="1318">This lamp is equipped with 210 high-density LED beads—20% more than previous versions—ensuring sharper, more vibrant colors. You can individually adjust each bead’s color, allowing you to create a personalized lighting scheme. Experiment with the colors as you turn your room into a unique light show.</p>
<p data-start="1320" data-end="1743">Sound quality is just as impressive as the lighting as the Govee Table Lamp 2 Pro is made in collaboration with JBL. Powered by a compact 2.5-inch, 500cc full-range speaker and backed by JBL’s equalizer algorithm, the audio is crisp and full of depth. For a more immersive experience, you can even pair two lamps together for stereo sound, with synchronized light effects to match.</p>


<p data-start="1320" data-end="1743">For those who want to take it even further, the Music DreamView feature allows you to synchronize the lamp with up to 10 other Govee lights. This turns your entire room into a synchronized light and sound experience, heightening the atmosphere (or perhaps causing sensory overload) for any occasion.</p>
<p data-start="1745" data-end="2034">This smart lamp offers up to 4.5 hours of continuous light and sound on a single charge. Note that that’s with volume and brightness set at 50%. The lamp has adjustable brightness (600lm) and a wide color temperature range (2700K–6500K). Fine tune it to your needs.</p>
<p data-start="2274" data-end="2533">The Govee Home app unlocks more personalization options, giving you full control over the lighting in your space. Voice control is possible with compatibility for Alexa, Google Assistant, and Matter, allowing you to adjust the settings or switch modes just by asking. Even set custom routines. You can make it so when you say, “Alexa, I’m going up, up, up,” the Govee lamp automatically shifts to a bright, golden hue and starts blasting “Golden” by Huntrix from <em>K-Pop Demon Hunters</em>.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/lego-clears-star-wars-imperial-star-destroyer-now-selling-4-8-rated-set-at-new-all-time-low-2000648724</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Putting together a huge LEGO set is one of those rare things that gets kids and adults to stop looking at screens. And when it comes to the Danish toy maker’s line, Star Wars themes are by far the best and the most popular. Harry Potter sets might get some love, but the galaxy far, far away is always at the top of the sales charts.</p>
<p>The problem with famous Star Wars builds is that they almost never go on sale for a lot less, so you have to be patient and wait for the right time to get one at a good price. The good news is that during Black Friday, <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6094/">the iconic Imperial Star destroyer set is on sale for $119 on Amazon, down from its normal price of $159</a>. As you might know, this model is one of the most popular ships in the entire collection.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6094/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>A Legendary Ship That Will Actually Fit on Your Shelf</h2>
<p>This<strong> 1,555-piece set</strong> turns the scary wedge-shaped cruiser from<em> A New Hope</em> into a brick model. The size is just right so it doesn’t take up too much space on your display and <strong>the finished model is 18 inches long and just over 6 inches tall</strong> so it stands out on a bookshelf without taking up an entire wall. LEGO made this version with a hidden carry handle that folds into the hull so that this way, younger builders can swoop it around the room during imaginary space battles without it falling apart in their hands.</p>



<p>The real magic happens inside the hull where LEGO packed in <strong>several rooms that show off the Empire’s harsh military style</strong>: There is a real bridge with command stations, a separate control room with technical panels, and even a break room because Stormtroopers need coffee breaks too. The armory has weapons for the crew, and the cargo area has the glowing Kyber Crystal pieces and thermal detonators that refer to deeper Star Wars lore.</p>
<p>These little things on the inside turn the build from a simple display piece into something you can actually explore and move around, which keeps the fun going long after the building is done. The engineering also makes sure that you can get to these areas without having to take down the whole building. The hinged panels swing open easily and lock back into place securely.</p>



<p>There are <strong>seven mini-figures in the box, and the main one is Darth Vader in full black armor and a cape</strong>. There’s also an Imperial Gunner, an Imperial Navy Trooper, and Commander Praji and a standard Stormtrooper is the backbone of the Empire’s forces. The set also comes with a <strong>25th anniversary edition of Cal Kestis</strong> from the Jedi video game series: This is a one-of-a-kind collectible that won’t be available in future releases.</p>
<p>This $40 discount is a big deal for a high-end LEGO set of this size and difficulty, especially since Star Wars collaborations don’t usually get discounts this big outside of big shopping events. You’re paying about $0,076 per piece, which is much less than the usual ratio that LEGO charges for licensed themes.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Anker Is Willing to Make Zero Margin on Its USB-C Charger 2-Pack, Cheaper Than Strarbucks Coffee]]></title>
            <link>https://kotaku.com/charge-multiple-devices-on-the-go-for-just-11-with-this-2-pack-of-ankers-20w-charger-2000648506</link>
            <guid>1368079</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Keeping your devices charged at all times doesn’t have to be complicated. Those who use multiple gadgets to get through their days can greatly benefit from dual-port chargers that make it easy to top up to two essentials at the same time. And today is a great time to pick a couple for literal pennies.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6079/">A 2-pack of Anker’s 20W charger, which typically sits at $19, just dropped to $11 at Amazon, after a whopping 41% discount</a>. Each of these comes with two ports, and with this deal, you’re basically paying just a little over $5 for each. The offer applies to the black color option. Others are discounted too, but the prices vary. For instance, the white option is sitting at $13, while green and purple are going for $14 each. Plus, for every color except black, discounts are only available to Prime members. These are Black Friday and Cyber Monday deals (even though the event is behind us), but they’re selling out fast. Get yours before the stock runs out or Amazon decides to push the price back up.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6079/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Fast, But Safe Charging for Your Essentials</h2>
<p>The charger is designed to be compact and portable. It fits in the palm of your hand, slides into your pocket, and can be tossed into any backpack without bulking things up. Getting two of these means you can keep one for home use, while the other in your laptop bag or car for hassle-free on-the-go usage. Two ports (one USB-C and one USB-A) let you power two devices at the same time. The 20W output isn’t massive, but still decent to juice your essentials up without taking too long. It can fast charge an iPhone 16 from 0 to 50% in around 30 minutes. You’ll enjoy maximum power when using a single port. When both are in use, expect each to deliver 7.5W max output.</p>



<p>A 5 ft USB-C to USB-C cable is included with each charger, which is long enough for you to be able to use the connected devices comfortably as they charge. As for compatibility, it plays nicely with a range of devices. These include iPhone Series 15 through 17, iPhone Pro Series (2024, 2023, 2022, 2021), the latest Google Pixel devices, recent Samsung phones, and even Galaxy tablets. You will also be able to power your earbuds, select iPad configurations, plus smartwatches with each. Basically, it covers all the devices you rely on on a regular basis. But despite all the power, the charger stays calm and cool as it works. Anker’s enhanced safety system includes overvoltage protection, temperature control, and other helpful safety features to protect your devices from long-term wear, while also maintaining their battery health.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6079/">Included in the box are two Anker chargers, a 2-pack 5 ft USB-C to USB-C cable, a welcome guide, and an 18-month warranty, in case something goes wrong. You can now grab this bundle for just $11.</a> It’s open to all shoppers, but Prime members will enjoy free delivery with their purchase, too. If you’re not one, you can still get free delivery, but only on orders above $35. Just don’t wait too long to grab the deal, as it’s going to end soon. Holiday rush is in full swing, and as a general rule, if you spot something you like, jump in on it while there’s still time. Additionally, there’s plenty more going at a discount right now, so it’s a good time to stock up on both the essentials and pricey options without blowing your budget.</p>

              <p>Having a lot of chargers plugged into every outlet makes a mess of cables and adapters that takes up space and looks bad. The Ugreen Nexode 65W charger combines everything into one small unit so you can charge your laptop, phone, and tablet all at once from one wall outlet. And the good news is that right now, this <strong>four-port GaN charger</strong>&nbsp;<a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4472/">is down from its usual price of $39 to $24</a> on Amazon.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4472/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Charges 4 Devices at Once</h2>
<p>The charger can be so small because of the new Gallium Nitride technology while Standard silicon-based chargers need bigger parts to safely handle 65W output. GaN works better and makes less heat which lets Ugreen fit a lot of charging power into a package that is only 2.64 x 1.65 x 1.5 inches. The <strong>foldable plug design</strong> makes it even more portable because the prongs tuck away flat which keeps other things in your bag from getting scratched and stops the charger from getting stuck on fabric.</p>
<p>The <strong>four-port setup with three USB-C outputs and one USB-A port</strong> works with almost all of your devices. You can charge your MacBook Pro through the main USB-C port at full speed which is 65W. This is the same speed as Apple’s own charger which charges a MacBook Air to 51% in just 30 minutes. The other ports can charge your phone, wireless earbuds, tablet, or even a Steam Deck at the same time.</p>



<p>Built-in protections keep the device from getting too hot or too much current, and they automatically change the power delivery when they sense a problem. You don’t have to worry about power surges or overheating problems that cheap chargers have when you leave devices plugged in overnight.</p>
<p>The <strong>smart power distribution system</strong> gives out watts based on what is connected and what each device needs: When you charge your phone, it gives it the right amount of power to charge quickly without giving it too much power, which could hurt the battery over time. When you add your laptop to the mix, the charger changes its power budget to give priority to the device that needs more power.</p>
<p>You get here <strong>four ports and 65W of power for $24 which is less than what most single-port chargers cost</strong>. Plus, the package is smaller than most laptop adapters.</p>

              <p>Black Friday weekend is here, and with that comes tons of deals across every product category under the sun ranging from vacuums to coffee makers to, yes, even video games. Amazon has the PlayStation 5 Slim on sale for $100 off. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5801/">This disc edition of the console has recently been priced as high as $550, but during this weekend, you can grab the system of just $450.</a></p>

<h2>Tons of Games</h2>
<p>Okay we all love our memes about the PS5 saving it has no games. And while maybe at this point in the console’s lifecycle we were hoping for a little more, the library of choices you have for what to play is far more than the barren wasteland Twitter makes it out to be.</p>
<p>The new <em>Ghost of Yōtei</em> is one of the best looking and best playing action games of the generation. <em>Returnal</em> is a fast-paced third-person shooter roguelike with eary vibes reminiscent of <em>Metroid</em>. <em>Astro Bot</em> is our much-needed plunge back into the 3D mascot platforming genre. It’s a brilliantly fun love letter to all things PlayStation and earned its title as 2024’s Game of the Year at The Game Awards last year.</p>
<p>Then if you missed out on the PS4 generation, you have countless titles waiting for you to dip into—some of which even enhanced for their move onto the PlayStation 5.&nbsp;<em>The Last of Us: Part 1 </em>and <em>The Last of Us: Part 2</em> regularly get cited as the best story in video games. Well, at least the first one does (though I am a stark defender of the second one). Form your own opinion on the choices made by the iconic characters in these post-apocalypse stories that went on to inspire and HBO adaptation.</p>
<p>Access a bunch of these instant classics with a subscription to PlayStation Plus Premium. You’ll be able to access hundreds of games across PlayStation generations like&nbsp;<em>Control, Kingdom Hearts 3, Final Fantasy VII Remake,&nbsp;</em>and more.</p>



<h2>Expandable Storage</h2>
<p>While this model PlayStation 5 is marketed as having a 1TB SSD, your actual usable storage isn’t quite that. Much of the internal drive’s space is dedicated toward system software that enables the PS5 be, well, a PS5. Out of the box, its more accurate to say you’ll be working with a little over 850GB.</p>
<p>If you’d prefer more space, you can always expand it. The PS5 Slim’s storage is expandable via an internal SSD slot. Brands like Crucial, Samsung, and Wester Digital all make SSDs which come with heatsinks and are compatible for installation in a PlayStation 5. Much of those you’ll be able find on sale this weekend and next between Black Friday and Cyber Week. Installation is pretty easy too. There are any number of tutorial videos to choose from on YouTube. All it takes is a screw driver and five minutes of your time.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Anker 12-in-1 Docking Station and Monitor Stand Combo Is Still at Black Friday Low for Cyber Monday]]></title>
            <link>https://kotaku.com/save-space-and-boost-efficiency-with-ankers-675-usb-c-docking-station-while-its-going-for-32-less-2000648509</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Docking stations are a great way to manage multiple devices on your desk without cord clutter. You plug everything into a single unit and keep it beside your monitor for easy access. But what if we told you there’s an even more efficient way of doing things?</p>
<p>Anker’s 675 USB-C Docking Station doubles as a monitor stand and lets you connect up to 12 devices at the same time! <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6077/">On a regular day, it would run you around $250, but all thanks to Black Friday, you can grab one for just $170 today.</a> That’s after a massive 32% discount. Even better, you’ll enjoy free shipping with your purchase, whether you’re a Prime member or not. The main sale event is technically over, and Cyber Monday is still a couple of days away. This lingering deal is a great way to save on an efficient charging solution if you missed grabbing it yesterday and can’t wait for Monday!</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6077/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Saves Space</h2>
<p>It looks like a regular monitor/laptop stand, even though it’s anything but that. You’re getting a bunch of ports on the side, including a 100W max USB-C upstream port, 3 USB-A ports, 2 USB-C ports, SD/microSD card slots, a 4K HDMI port, a wireless charging pad, and an Ethernet port. That’s everything you need to connect all your essentials, plus a few extras, without feeling limited. Place your monitor on the top, and then add a keyboard, external storage, headphones, and more. The wireless charging pad makes it easy to top up your smartphone while you’re busy being productive. All of us have our phones on our workstations anyway, so it’s a great way to juice them up instead of letting them sit idle. The 100W max USB-C upstream port charges your laptop as you work, just as well. Note that the dock does not support display via any of the USB-C ports. You can only do that using the single HDMI port. It shouldn’t be a problem, though, unless you’re looking for a bigger, multi-monitor setup with three or four screens.</p>
<p>There’s some space under the dock that you can use to store your keyboard and mouse when not in use. Just push them under once you’re done working, and come back to a clean, tidy setup the next day. Raising your monitor to your eye level also promotes a better posture, as you can easily sit up straight instead of slouching.</p>



<p>Exceptional stability comes from an Aircraft-Grade aluminum alloy body with an anti-slip silicone strip for sturdiness. The curved edge design makes the overall look and feel premium. It’s built to blend into any workstation, from the most basic ones to those that have quite a lot going on in terms of personality. Getting started is straightforward, as just plugging your laptop in wakes your entire workstation up. The dock plays nicely with a wide range of laptops and monitors, including Dell XPS, Lenovo, iMac, MacBook, and more. OS-wise, it works well with Windows 10 and 11, plus macOS 10.14 and above.</p>
<p>The package comes with the docking station, a welcome guide, and an 18-month warranty.<a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6077/"> The current deal brings the price down to just $170, which is basically nothing for the features it offers.</a> You’re saving a nice $80 on a solution that’s going to make your workstation much more efficient and a whole lot cleaner.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/apples-2025-macbook-pro-dropped-to-its-lowest-price-ever-for-black-friday-2000648462</link>
            <guid>1368034</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Black Friday and Cyber Week are upon us. Now is the time to save big on tech stuff, home good, and everything else under the sun. Been thinking about upgrading your laptop? <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6078/">Amazon is offering the Apple MacBook Pro at its lowest price yet, with a 16% discount that slashes $251 off the regular price, bringing it down to just $1,349</a>. If you’ve been eyeing this powerhouse laptop, there’s no better time to grab it.</p>
<p data-start="484" data-end="1070">This particular model is the 2025 version of the MacBook Pro, featuring Apple’s latest M5 chip, built to handle even the most demanding tasks. The M5 is equipped with a 10-core CPU and a 10-core GPU, delivering exceptional performance for everything from creative work to software development.

<h2 data-start="484" data-end="1070">Built for Apple Intelligence</h2>
<p data-start="1072" data-end="1516">AI has taken over the zeitgeist so its unsurprising Apple’s marketing around the M5 chip is leading with the buzzword. It’s been engineered for what Apple calls “Apple Intelligence,” making it powerful enough for automatically compiling tons of code, responding to AI prompts, and generating images based solely on descriptions. Whether you engage with AI or now, the chip’s power still translates into faster performance and more efficiency, so you can get more done in less time.</p>
<p data-start="1518" data-end="1947">Battery life on the 2025 MacBook Pro is exceptional. Thanks to the M5 chip, you can expect up to 24 hours of continuous use on a single charge, which is an incredible improvement over Intel-based MacBook Pro models. In fact, this is up to 14 times longer battery life than previous Intel versions, allowing you to work, stream, and browse for hours without worrying about finding an outlet.</p>
<p data-start="1949" data-end="2358">The MacBook Pro’s 14.2-inch Liquid Retina display is another highlight. The screen boasts an impressive 1,600 nits of brightness and supports a wide color gamut, delivering vibrant, true-to-life colors that will make all your photos, videos, and creative projects pop. The display’s able to render one billion colors, ensuring incredible detail and accuracy when watching a movie or editing photos.</p>


<p data-start="2360" data-end="2782">For those who rely on video calls—whether for work, school, or just catching up with loved ones—the MacBook Pro has some great little features . The built-in 12MP camera shoots in full 1080p HD, ensuring that you always look your best during meetings or virtual hangouts. The three-microphone array works alongside the six-speaker system to create an immersive sound experience, using spatial audio technology to ensure clear audio on both ends of the call.</p>
<p data-start="2784" data-end="3289">The camera also features Apple’s Center Stage, which uses AI to automatically adjust the camera’s angle as you move, ensuring you remain centered in the frame throughout video calls. No matter where you are in the room, Center Stage keeps you in view. This feature is compatible with pretty much all the popular video call apps like FaceTime and Zoom.</p>
<p data-start="3291" data-end="3572">This model is available in two elegant color options: space black and silver, so you can choose the one that best suits your style. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6078/">Both are on sale for Cyber Monday at its all-time low price of just $1,349.</a></p>

            <title><![CDATA[Breville Barista Espresso Machine Hits All-Time Low, Now Cheaper Than 3 Months of Starbucks]]></title>
            <link>https://kotaku.com/breville-barista-espresso-machine-hits-all-time-low-now-cheaper-than-3-months-of-starbucks-2000648693</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>This year on Black Friday, Breville brought serious firepower by lowering the price <strong>of Amazon’s best-selling espresso machine</strong>. The <em>Barista Express</em> doesn’t go on <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5371/">sale very often, so this $499 deal, which is $200 less than the usual $699 price</a>, is a real event that is causing a lot of trouble in the coffee machine category.</p>
<p>This price is <strong>lower than spending $5 a day at a coffee shop for three months</strong>. Plus, the coffee you make at home usually tastes better because you can control everything. This record low price is still available through the weekend after Black Friday, as long as supplies last.</p>

<h2>Integrated Grinder</h2>
<p>You don’t need a separate grinder that takes up counter space and adds another step to your morning because this one has a built-in conical burr grinder. You can go from whole beans to pulling espresso shots in less than a minute, which is important when you’re half-awake and need that first cup fast. The dose control grinding system grinds coffee beans and sends them straight to the portafilter and keeps the coffee’s flavor at its best because coffee starts to lose its aromatic compounds right after it is ground.</p>
<p>The design of the grinding cradle lets you put the portafilter right under the grinder output so you can catch every bit of ground coffee without having to move it between containers. Because of this integration, there are fewer parts to clean and less coffee that gets stuck to different surfaces. The precise conical burr mechanism makes sure that the particle sizes are always the same and this directly affects the quality of the extraction, since uneven grounds can lead to a shot that is both too bitter and too sour.</p>



<p><strong>Controlling the temperature is what makes the difference between bad espresso and great shots at home</strong>: The digital PID system keeps the water temperature in a very small range, so it comes out at just the right temperature for the best extraction. If you heat the coffee too much, it will burn and taste bitter, which will overpower everything else. If it’s too cold, you don’t extract enough, which leaves you with weak, sour espresso that tastes like disappointment.</p>
<p>One thing that sets basic espresso machines apart from more advanced ones is the low pressure pre-infusion: At the start of extraction, t<strong>he system slowly raises the pressure instead of hitting the coffee puck</strong> with full force right away. This slow start lets the grounds bloom and soak up water evenly, which means that all the flavors are drawn out evenly instead of through weak spots in the puck.</p>



<p>The <strong>steam wand has enough power to make microfoam milk</strong>, not just hot and bubbly milk. Real microfoam is smooth and velvety, and it adds sweetness to your drink. If you want to practice your pouring skills, it also lets you make latte art. You can control the texturing process by hand with the wand, which lets you learn the skills that professional baristas use. You heat and aerate the milk at the same time which gives cappuccinos and lattes that shiny pour that makes them taste like they came from a fancy coffee shop.</p>
<p>Right now, you save $200 on a machine that would cost you the same amount of money in coffee shop visits in four months of daily use. If you buy the grinder on its own, it will cost you $150 to $300. You will also need to buy an espresso machine. This deal gives you the ability to make café-quality espresso at a price that makes sense compared to going to the coffee shop every day.</p>
