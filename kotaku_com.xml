Join us as we say goodbye to this extraordinary series. </p><figure id="" data-id="afpvuwnfoibrncd6upmy" data-recommend-id="image://afpvuwnfoibrncd6upmy" data-format="png" data-width="800" data-height="88" data-lightbox="true" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><span data-id="afpvuwnfoibrncd6upmy" data-recommend-id="image://afpvuwnfoibrncd6upmy" data-format="png" data-width="800" data-height="88" data-lightbox="true" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p><strong>Ethan Gach:</strong> I’m in camp Kleya, who called her arrival on Yavin in the final stretch of <em>Andor </em>“a bitter ending,” but perhaps somewhat more consoled than she was by Cassian reassurance that “nothing’s ending.”</p><p>The final three episodes of season 2 were always going to be somewhat disappointing and bittersweet since we knew the show was ending and in some cases we knew where it would need to funnel people to set up <em>Rogue One,</em> but the final chapter still managed a surprising amount of high-stakes tension and unexpected backstory. </p><p>How would you both rate the final episodes and what are you feeling now that the journey’s over?</p><p><strong>Carolyn Petit: </strong>I thought episode 10, with its look at how Luthen and Kleya formed their bond and her undertaking the terrible task of doing what needed to be done, was outstanding. (It also gave us an alien who instantly became one of my favorite <em>Star Wars </em>creatures ever!) </p><p>Episodes 11 and 12 weren’t peak <em>Andor</em>, but I have to admit that the final slow-motion montage sequence really worked for me, and they had a political dimension I found somewhat surprising that I’ll discuss a bit more later.</p><p><strong>Zack Zwiezen:</strong> I was worried that the final episode would run out of steam as Tony Gilroy and co literally ran out of space for storytelling and had to slam the brakes to set up <em>Rogue One. </em>And while I enjoyed the montage slow-walk, I wonder if that works if you haven’t seen <em>Rogue One</em>. </p><p>But overall, the final three episodes are really good. And I think the Kleya-Luthen focused episode is one of my favorite <em>Andor </em>episodes ever. I’m so happy she got a big spotlight before the end.</p><p><strong>CP: </strong>Me, too. That episode also helped cement, I think, that the show recognizes how necessary all of Luthen’s efforts were, even if those fussy ineffectual bureaucrats on Yavin don’t. </p><p>This is an issue I’ve long had with how <em>Star Wars</em> has at times sanded away its own political dimensions in my view, something that <em>Andor </em>not only seeks to undo but takes farther than ever before. In truth, the act of blowing up the Death Star in the first film, that act which people cheered for in theaters in 1977 and that <em>Star Wars</em> fans for decades since have loved and admired, would, in universe, be considered an act of terrorism. That’s what the Empire would call it. That’s what governments do: they present their own violence as “legitimate” or “necessary” and the violence of those rebelling against them as “terrorism.” </p><p>But there were times in <em>Star Wars</em> history where I felt like the people at the reins of the franchise wanted to send a message that you shouldn’t be “too extreme” in your resistance, don’t be a Saw Gerrera, do it through “proper channels.” And so I loved that <em>Andor </em>gave us that scene with Bail and some other politicians all kind of hemming and hawing over Luthen while the show, I think, was emphatically telling all of us, “Luthen was right. Maybe not every single little decision he made was right, but his ethos was fundamentally right and without someone like him, none of this would have been here.” And I loved it for that.</p><p><strong>ZZ:</strong> I think, and they talk about this in the behind the scenes, it’s very important that Luthen’s fight against the empire was really because Kleya wanted revenge.</p><p><strong>CP:</strong> Right. She’s the humanity that he’s fighting for. She’s what radicalizes him.</p><p><strong>ZZ: </strong>If he hadn’t found her and saved her, Luthen likely doesn’t become the rebel we know in <em>Andor</em>. And it also adds a new layer of complexity to their relationship. He was part of the army that brutalized her people. So she still has some lingering hatred for him. And yet she does care about him. And in that moment when she sneaks into the hospital to finish the job, you can feel that.</p><p><strong>EG:</strong> I think that scene with the Rebel Alliance leaders also helps show the Senate mentality creeping back in as the insurgency professionalizes itself.</p><p>It’s easy to see why even after defeating the Empire in key battles it might struggle to rebuild or retain power, issues explored in <em>Ahsoka </em>and <em>The Mandalorian</em>. These last few episodes help situate Cassian between the uncompromising logic of Luthen’s spycraft and the “no one left behind” mentality of the Rebellion. Luthen’s final sacrifice is to die, and Cassian’s is to go back and risk everything just to save someone.</p><p><strong>ZZ: </strong>We should rewind a bit and talk about that moment between Luthen and Dedra. Or even further actually, and pour one out for Lonni, who I knew was dead the moment he sat down at that bench.</p><p><strong>CP: </strong>Yeah. When he mentioned his wife and kid, for a moment I thought mayyyyyyyybe Luthen would be like “You know what? I owe this guy.” But alas, no.</p><p><strong>ZZ:</strong> I also loved that line Luthen gave Klaya before the meeting: “I think we used up all the perfect.” </p><p><strong>CP:</strong> So good.</p><p><strong>ZZ:</strong> And then we get Dedra Meero walking into Luthen’s shop as he’s destroying evidence. My wife literally gasped “OH SHIT!” at seeing Dedra at the door.</p><p><strong>EG: </strong>Only two artifacts may not be what they seem!</p><p><strong>CP:</strong> In a show that so often demands that characters put on a performance to blend into their surroundings, it was great seeing those two feel each other out and Luthen pretend for a bit that she was maybe not there to arrest him. </p><p>But then, of course, he tries to kill himself, and you see that he was thinking a few steps ahead when he picked up the knife, though he made it seem like it was just part of their friendly dealings.</p><p><strong>ZZ:</strong> When he picked up the knife I was so distracted by him mentioning it being a Nautolan artifact (Kit Fisto’s species) that I didn’t realize why he picked a knife.</p><p><strong>CP:</strong> Hahaha, the perils of having a database of<em> Star Wars</em> knowledge in your brain!</p><p><strong>ZZ:</strong> And then after he’s taken to the hospital, we get that wonderful sequence with Klaya sneaking in and taking him off life support. Anybody else want a <em>Hitman</em>-like <em>Star Wars</em> game now?</p><p><strong>CP:</strong> If that alien Kleya pushes around as she’s pretending to be hospital personnel is in it, absolutely! But yes, that was a great infiltration sequence, both thrilling and kind of excruciating because we knew what she was going there to do.</p><p><strong>EG:</strong> It included some of the best Coruscant backdrops we’ve ever gotten, I think.</p><p><strong>CP:</strong> One other moment from that episode that I can’t stop thinking about was the flashback scene in which we see Imperial officers drag some civilians through town, put them up against a wall, and kill them. </p><p>It was another gut-wrenching reminder of the Empire’s evil and another moment that felt weirdly resonant as more and more people are being arrested by agents who often won’t even show warrants or identification in the streets of our towns.</p><p><strong>ZZ:</strong> On the flipside of that horrible moment that made me feel a pit in my stomach, we have Dedra getting arrested for being reckless and not following orders by chasing after Luthen long after she was supposed to be off the Axis investigation. I have to admit I smiled when I realized it was all over for her.</p><p><strong>CP:</strong> Man, I don’t know. I mean I absolutely hate her, don’t get me wrong, and yet that final shot of her, where we see that she’s in a prison very much like the one Cassian was in last season (if not the same one) was complicated for me. Like, I think that kind of incarceration is just wrong in and of itself and so it elicited this weird moment of something like sympathy for her, which in no way means I forgive her for what she’s done. It’s just one of those reminders that it’s ultimately a systemic evil that will sometimes grind up the people operating inside of it and supporting it as much as those being actively persecuted.</p><p>The leopards ate her face, in other words.</p><p><strong>ZZ: </strong>Space leopards.</p><p>But I agree, yes, that the Empire is evil and the way it operates (like many real-world countries) is to crush people up to fuel the fires of growth and war. And I think it was very arrogant of her to believe she would be spared. Or maybe she truly bought into the lies that the Empire was good and doing the right thing? Surely, she won’t end up in some horrible place and left to rot forever.</p><p><strong>CP: </strong>Yep.</p><p><strong>ZZ: </strong>Meanwhile, her boss, after all of these failures and letting the info on the Death Star slip out, realizes what’s coming for him and knows he doesn’t want to be ripped apart by the machine he helped create. And takes an easier way out. </p><p><strong>CP:</strong> That was the first and only indication we ever got that Nemik’s manifesto is actually spreading around, right, that people are listening to it? That was a cool moment, I thought, where at first we think it’s non-diegetic, just the writers and filmmakers reminding us one last time of Nemik’s stirring words, but then we see, oh, no, Partagaz was actually listening to it, the fire is spreading. It’s out there.</p><p><strong>EG: </strong>I loved the scene right outside when the gun shot goes off.</p><p><strong>CP: </strong>Yeah, so clear that the guy knew Partagaz wasn’t just taking a moment to “collect his thoughts,” he knew exactly what was coming.</p><p><strong>ZZ: </strong>The slight “stand down” gesture to the troopers.</p><p><strong>EG: </strong>I appreciate the minor moments of humanity <em>Andor </em>evokes even between the worst people.</p><p><strong>CP: </strong>Yeah, they’re essential IMO.</p><p><strong>ZZ:</strong> It makes them more evil. They are human beings. People with feelings and thoughts. And yet they still do this shit.</p><p><strong>EG:</strong> Something also given to Krennic when he and Partagaz wish each other luck at facing Palpatine’s wrath. Unlike the more buffoonish bad guy energy he gives off in <em>Rogue One</em>.</p><p><strong>ZZ:</strong> Also, very fun to see a character call out the Death Star name. Partagaz thinks its dumb.</p><p><strong>ZZ:</strong> I’m so happy to see K-2SO back!</p><p><strong>CP:</strong> Yes. Not unlike C-3P0 he can be so exasperating at times (in an endearing and funny way), but when he goes full Terminator on Empire goons, man it feels good.</p><p>For me, the whole tone of the scene with Andor and Melshi in the safehouse with Kleya and the communications jammed changed from “Oh shit, oh shit, get outta there!” to “LMAO y’all are about to get owned” as soon as K-2SO left the ship to go in for them, and it was glorious.</p><p><strong>ZZ:</strong> Yeah. The moment K-2SO shows up, it’s basically over for those imperial assholes and I loved it so much. I also like that the show uses its limited time with K-2SO to really develop a relationship between him and Cassian. They seem like buds!</p><p>The part where they are playing space poker or whatever was great. Gilroy mentioned that after Bix leaves the place becomes a frat house, with Melshi moving in and them all drinking and partying between missions.</p><p><strong>CP: </strong>Ah, that totally makes sense!</p><p><strong>ZZ:</strong> I wonder if Andor is trying to drink away some pain and fill his life with friends to deal with losing Bix? That’s my read. He needs some buds and suds.</p><p><strong>CP: </strong>Definitely. </p><p>There’s a part of me that still feels like Andor, the title character, could have maybe used a little bit more character development in this show, that with all of its moving pieces his own journey, both ideologically and as a person, maybe got a smidge sidelined. But I do like that we see him dreaming about his sister, since finding her was the big obsession driving him in the early episodes of season one. </p><p>Now, I feel like he’s accepted that she’s gone but still the idea of her, his depth of feeling for her and the pain of losing her is part of what drives him to create a better world, not entirely unlike Luthen being driven by his love for Kleya. And speaking of love and the things that drive us, how did y’all feel about that final-final image of the show?</p><p><strong>ZZ: </strong>I loved it! To me it worked perfectly with a theme in <em>Andor</em>: hope.</p><p><strong>EG:</strong> “There is another.” lmao.</p><p><strong>CP:</strong> Right, to me it did in part feel like a nod to <em>Star Wars</em>’ obsession with dynasties and legacies, like we have to believe that, though Andor himself dies, what he stands for will live on not just as an idea but because he literally has a child. And yet, I still kinda liked it. We didn’t get a lightsaber but we did get a continued bloodline!</p><p><strong>ZZ:</strong> I think the show needed some hope at the end.</p><p><strong>EG:</strong> I think it was very thematically appropriate, even if I’m torn on the merits of mixing insurgency and family. It’s a division that feels a bit too tidy.</p><p><strong>ZZ: </strong>I think it did provide more reason for Bix leaving like she did. She was pregnant. She wanted to give her child a peaceful life and knew Andor would follow her if he knew. And in her mind, she’s thinking that they’ll get back together one day after the Empire has fallen. It’s both a very tragic final scene and also this reminder that there is more. This isn’t an ending.</p><figure id="" data-id="fad46f7e30d05a59aba45bbdb8a7cd39" data-recommend-id="image://fad46f7e30d05a59aba45bbdb8a7cd39" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Lucasfilm / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="fad46f7e30d05a59aba45bbdb8a7cd39" data-recommend-id="image://fad46f7e30d05a59aba45bbdb8a7cd39" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p><strong>CP:</strong> Vel even tells him not to wait too long to reconnect, and we already know he never gets the chance! Really loved that those two, Cassian and Vel, got a moment here, too, and got to acknowledge all those they’ve lost along the way. </p><p>But yes, you’re right, it was a lovely mix of deeply sad and hopeful, that final image. Luthen, Cassian, Saw, and so many others know they’re fighting for a world they themselves will likely not live to see. But that kid might.</p><p><strong>ZZ:</strong> And before we leave, I did like that we got one more tiny moment with Mon’s husbasnd</p><p>He seems to be with the mother of the boy his daughter married? It was very fast. Couldn’t tell. But him just getting drunk in a limo on Coruscant, presumably throwing his wife under the bus and pledging loyalty to the Empire, seemed like all we needed to know about what happened to him.</p><p><strong>CP:</strong> Exactly. He is who we knew he was and his sad empty privileged life is his reward for it.</p><p>I’d be curious to know how that final montage plays for folks who haven’t seen <em>Rogue One</em>. It really worked for me, seeing Cassian all dressed up for his fateful mission, the cuts to Dedra and other characters, and all around him, the Rebel base on Yavin, active and buzzing, about to change the galaxy, and now we know it’s all because of the efforts of so many people but among them, one Luthen Rael, an unsung hero of <em>Star Wars.</em> Are either of you planning on rewatching <em>Rogue One</em> any time soon?</p><p><strong>ZZ:</strong> I wanted to hold off until after this VG chat so I came into this without the weight of <em>Rogue One </em>on my mind. I plan on watching it this weekend! </p><p><strong>EG:</strong> I will say, as a parting thought, I don’t know that I needed the show to try and line up so neatly with <em>Rogue One,</em> perhaps the worst part of which is that silly blueprint handoff that directly leads into <em>A New Hope.</em> I do think some of the broader thrust of <em>Andor </em>and the unease and disquiet within its characters ended up being subsumed a little to neatly by the end of episode 12.</p><p><strong>CP: </strong>Oh, I agree. At a certain point in the final episode you really feel the show shift into “Okay, let’s get all the pieces in place for <em>Rogue On</em>e” mode.</p><p><strong>ZZ:</strong> Yeah. It reminds me of the ending of <em>Star Wars Episode III</em>, where George Lucas sets up all the pieces for <em>A New Hope </em>and it feels less like an actual ending and more like a checkpoint.</p><p><strong>CP:</strong> And I think heading right from <em>Andor </em>into <em>Rogue One</em> will be quite jarring because—sorry <em>Rogue On</em>e!—your dialogue is just not on the same level!</p><p><strong>ZZ:</strong> Nope! And what happened to Bail Organa! Did he get a haircut?</p><p><strong>CP:</strong> Hahaha.</p><p><strong>ZZ:</strong> But really, if that’s my biggest complaint about <em>Andor</em>—that its ending isn’t as strong as it could have been because of <em>Rogue One</em>—I’m still really happy.</p><p>I’m not sure we’ll ever get a show like this again, or at least not for a long time. Real sets. Lots of actors. Incredible writing. Big budgets. Set in a large franchise. All this freedom. Even Gilroy has stated he’s not sure if this kind of thing will ever happen again.</p><p><strong>CP:</strong> It was glorious, and while I really hope we see more like it, I’ll try to just be grateful for the miracle that we ever got it at all. Now I just need Disney to put it on Blu-ray so I have it on physical media and it’s not trapped on a streaming service forever!</p><p><strong>ZZ:</strong> Rebellions and physical libraries of movies we love are built on hope. </p><p> .<br></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
