              <p>Look up any portable video device — smartphone, tablet, or camera — and you’ll get a full, vivid description of just how good its video quality is. That does leave out one very important and all-too-often ignored part of a truly pro-quality recording — the sound. Even the best smartphones and pocket-sized action cams can leave you with truly spectacular video paired with tinny, shallow sound filled with background noise.</p>
<p>There’s no need for a boom mic — the DJI Mic Mini wireless lavalier microphone transmitter is the tiny, ultra-lightweight (10 grams) solution that delivers exceptional sound from as far away as 400 meters. Content creators, vloggers, and travel buffs can give their content a massive upgrade for a lowest-ever price during this <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5868/">Amazon Black Friday blowout that drops the price of the DJI Mic Mini by 45%, down to just $66.&nbsp;</a></p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5868/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Pro-Level Sound for Pro-Level Content</h2>
<p>As 4K or even higher-resolution video has moved from being the exclusive property of professional videographers to being a smartphone feature that you carry in your pocket, the world of content creation has exploded. But with ultra-hi-res videos and vlogs being created by virtually anyone and everyone, the best way to set yourself apart from the masses is with content that pairs that video with sound that’s just as good. DJI has mastered ultra-high-quality cameras, both in their tiny action cameras and their famous fleet of consumer drones. Once they turned their attention to sound, it was no surprise that the result was exceptionally small and lightweight, highly versatile, and of the best quality.</p>
<p>In barely a year’s time the Mic Mini has become the gold standard of rechargeable wireless microphones, with a stellar 4.7-star average rating at Amazon. It can be worn as a clip-on, on a lanyard, or magnetically attached to your clothes — regardless of how you decide to go, it’s unobtrusive on camera and able to deliver a highly stable, impeccable sound transmission from as far away as 400 meters, even in busy or noisy environments. Two built-in levels of noise cancellation — Basic for quiet indoor settings and Strong for noisy environments or outdoor shoots — cut out the background noise, often the biggest shortfall of video shot on a smartphone.</p>



<h2>The Total Package</h2>
<p>The sound quality of the DJI Mini Mic sets it apart from the built-in mics of any consumer-level video device — 48Hz sampling and 120 decibels of full, clear, rich sound. This Amazon deal includes everything you need to give your videos a huge sound boost – two transmitters and one receiver, a USB-C charging cable, four mini windscreens, a type-C smartphone adapter, two DJI Mic Mini Clip magnets, and a carrying pouch.</p>
<p>If you’re already shooting video with a DJI Osmo camera — the Pocket 3, Action 4, or Action 5 Pro, the Mini Mic can be used in a direct wireless connection to the camera, delivering premium audio without the need for a receiver. And a single charge gives you 48 hours of shoot time, so you never have to worry about going silent in the middle of a shoot.</p>
<p>For anyone who wants their videos to sound as good or even better than they look, this is the best $66 upgrade you can make. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5868/">It’s an amazing pre-Black Friday deal that’s live right now at Amazon — 45% off the price of the DJI Mic Mini.</a></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>LEGO’s official website lists flagship sets at full retail price year-round with very little pricing variations. Amazon manages its own inventory and slashed the prices of thousands of products aggressively on Black Friday. Indeed, while <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4190/">LEGO still sells the Star Wars Millennium Falcon (25th anniversary) set for $84 on its website, Amazon slashes it to $67</a>. This <strong>921-piece collectible build</strong> of one of the most iconic starships in cinematic history is now at its lowest price ever.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4190/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Our Favorite Star Wars Set</h2>
<p>The 921-piece construction is satisfying to build and requires several sessions of focused building time. Each bag of parts opens up a new section of the Falcon, from the detailed cockpit to the iconic sensor dish. The process of building naturally encourages mindful relaxation as you work your way through the instructions, never hurrying the pace.</p>
<p>The <strong>mid-scale size</strong> hits the sweet spot between desktop models and massive display pieces: At 9.5 inches long, 7.5 inches wide, and 5 inches high, the finished Falcon commands attention without dominating an entire shelf. The proportions of this LEGO version hold true to the ship from A New Hope and do so in a structurally safe way. You can place this next to other mid-scale starships from the LEGO Star Wars collection with no mismatched sizes. The dimensions are perfect for home office desks, bedroom shelves, or living room displays.</p>



<p>Authentic details recreate the Falcon’s most recognizable features in LEGO brick form: The cockpit sits offset on the starboard side, just as it should. The quad laser cannons rotate and articulate for different display poses. The sensor dish mounts on top in its classic pre-Return of the Jedi configuration. The hull greebling makes use of clever part combinations to suggest the weathered, lived-in aesthetic of the original prop.</p>
<p>Thoughtful presentation features on the display stand take this set from toy to décor piece. Instead of placing flat on the table, the angled mounting provides dynamic visual interest. The nameplate clearly identifies the ship for guests who might not be too familiar with Star Wars. There is <strong>also a brick that commemorates 25 years of LEGO’s partnership with Star Wars</strong>. This stand design shows LEGO understands their adult audience, wanting display-worthy builds rather than play sets.</p>



<p><strong>4.9 out of 5 stars, with almost 2,000 reviews,</strong> confirms this set lives up to expectations. More than 10,000 sold in the last month prove sustained popularity well beyond a niche following among Star Wars fans. The wide appeal crosses multiple demographics: long-time fans of the franchise, LEGO collectors, décor-conscious adults, and gift-givers seeking a well-appreciated gift. The universal recognition of the Millennium Falcon transcends typical hobby boundaries.</p>
<p>At $67, the Star Wars Millennium Falcon set offers collectible quality 20% off retail this Black Friday. LEGO’s official site is still charging full price, while Amazon moves inventory aggressively.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/asus-rog-strix-24-5-gaming-monitor-sees-a-major-black-friday-price-shift-with-a-3-year-warranty-attached-2000638579</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>If you’re on the hunt for a new monitor, be it for your main screen or as a second, or dare I say, a third display, you can get a solid piece of hardware without emptying out your entire wallet. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5867/">Right now, Amazon has the ASUS ROG Strix — a 24.5-inch Full HD gaming monitor — on Black Friday sale for 43% off.</a> This hefty discount brings the price down by a whopping $130. It usually sells for $299, so that means you end up only having to pay $169 for a limited time.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5867/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Insane Frame Rates</h2>
<p>When it comes to monitors, if you want to stay within a reasonable budget, you’re going to need to make some decisions on what your priority is. Like, do you want your screen to be massive above all else? Do you want the sharpest detail with a crazy 4K resolution? Well, the ASUS ROG Strix is for the frame rate freaks out there. Sure, it only measures at a humble 24.5 inches. It only displays in your standard 1080p HD resolution. However, this monitor is capable of up to 310Hz. People love to argue online over what the maximum perception of the human eye is when it comes to screen refresh rates, but this thing has got to be approaching that.&nbsp;You’ll be able to game at ridiculously fast frame rates without sacrificing much size or detail. 24.5-inches and 1080p is still good.</p>



<p>The ASUS ROG Strix monitor has a 1ms response time. This will make it so all your inputs feel immediate and snappy. A high response time will make it so every move feels like you’re walking through mud. That won’t be a problem on this monitor. I’ve been playing <em>Ho</em><em>llow Knight: Silksong&nbsp;</em>through Game Pass UItimate, meaning I have access to it on both my Xbox and my PC. I had started out on my Xbox which is connected to a fairly cheap 2017 Vizio. I struggled hard with a lot of the platforming sections, but then I switched over to playing on a new Lenovo Legion gaming laptop and man is that change night and day. I now know it’s time my TV gets and upgrade.</p>
<p>You have multiple options when it comes to how you connect to this ASUS monitor. It supports USB-C, DisplayPort 1.4, and HDMI. So you can connect a laptop, your PC tower, a phone, or perhaps your new ASUS ROG Xbox Ally if you so please.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/amazon-would-give-its-soundbar-away-free-if-it-could-40-off-makes-it-3x-cheaper-than-rivals-2000646844</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/amazon-would-give-its-soundbar-away-free-if-it-could-40-off-makes-it-3x-cheaper-than-rivals.1362856/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Bose and Sonos watched nervously as Amazon entered the soundbar market after noticing the category’s massive sales potential. Amazon’s strategy was simple: create their own hardware and undercut premium brands on price while delivering competitive quality. The <strong>Fire TV Soundbar Plus</strong> represents this approach perfectly and packs 3.1 channels, a built-in subwoofer, Dolby Atmos, and DTS:X into a package that costs a fraction of comparable models.</p>
<p>At <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4053/">$149, down from $249, this newest model has hit an all-time low price</a> on Amazon for Black Friday.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4053/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Best Soundbar</h2>
<p>The <strong>integrated subwoofer</strong> addresses the most significant compromise in budget soundbars by housing appropriate bass drivers within the main unit. You get deep, room-filling low-end without buying and placing a separate subwoofer box. Action movies provide satisfying rumble during explosions and car chases. Music playback maintains warmth and body across genres from hip-hop to rock.</p>
<p>The <strong>3.1 configuration adds a dedicated center channel </strong>specifically for reproduction of dialogue. Conversations, narration, and vocal performances come through exceptionally well. You finally stop reaching for the remote when scenes switch between quiet talking and loud action. It also keeps your center channel focused on speech frequencies while left and right channels handle music and effects, which stops a muddy audio mix plaguing cheaper 2.0 soundbars.</p>



<p><strong>Dolby Atmos support introduces 3D audio</strong> that flies around and above your listening position. Height virtualization bounces the sound off your ceiling to create overhead effects in movies and shows. Helicopters fly over your head, rain falls from above, and atmospheric sounds envelope you on all sides. DTS:X offers similarly multi-dimensional audio with somewhat different processing. Both transform your living room into a theater-like experience without needing to install ceiling speakers.</p>
<p>Setup takes only minutes via a <strong>single HDMI cable attached to the eARC or ARC port on your TV</strong>. Audio automatically stays perfectly synchronized with video over the HDMI connection. You avoid the lip-sync issues that plague budget setups with optical cable connections. Power the soundbar on, and your TV instantly recognizes it. The included HDMI cable means you do not need to invest in any more accessories.</p>
<p>It has <strong>four preset audio modes that automatically adjust the sound</strong>, depending on the content. Movie mode enhances dynamic range for cinematic experiences with deep bass and clear dialogue. Music mode balances frequencies to accurately reproduce your favorite songs and albums. Sports mode amplifies crowd noise and commentary for live events. Night mode compresses dynamic range so late-night viewing won’t disturb others.</p>



<p>The Amazon Fire TV Soundbar Plus delivers premium features at nearly half the retail price this Black Friday, priced at $149. Amazon actually made up the soundbar category to begin with specifically to provide better value than the established brands. If cinematic audio is what you need but want to avoid the premium prices, then this record-low deal proves that you don’t need to spend over $500 on a soundbar.</p>

              <p>One of <a href="https://kotaku.com/intergalactic-heretic-prophet-naughty-dog-ps5-actors-1851722128">the biggest surprises at 2024’s trailer-fest The Game Awards</a> was a brand new game from&nbsp;<em>The Last of Us</em> creators Naughty Dog, a sci-fi action-adventure called&nbsp;<a href="https://kotaku.com/intergalactic-the-heretic-prophet-naughty-dog-trailer-1851720900"><em>Intergalactic: The Heretic Prophet</em></a>. Being the first new property from the developer in 12 years, there was good reason to sit up and take notice. Except, following that initial reveal, there was nothing to take notice of. A year later, tipsters are advising us not to get our hopes up for this year’s Geoff-Fest, given the game is very unlikely to be seen.</p> <p>That reveal last year was so compelling. Central character Jordan A. Mun was instantly very appealing, her misanthropic approach to space travel seemingly a result of the falling apart of her previous band of criminals, the Five Aces, as she now appeared to be hunting them all down. Of course, the trailer was also met with a vicious and deeply pathetic backlash from the remaining denizens of X who cannot tolerate the existence of a female video game protagonist who isn’t there for them to fap over before crying themselves to sleep. But idiots aside, it showed truly wonderful acting from Tati Gabrielle as Jordan, and potential for more of the exquisite storytelling that Naughty Dog is known for. If we can just ignore the excruciating ads for Porsche and Adidas.</p>

  <p>But since last November, we’ve not heard a peep, other than just how far away we are from getting this game. In September this year, <a href="https://kotaku.com/intergalactic-heretic-prophet-neil-druckmann-last-us-part-3-hbo-2000624967">game director Neil Druckmann spoke to&nbsp;<em>Variety</em></a> and mentioned that the game is in full development, but spoke of&nbsp;<em>Intergalactic</em>‘s massive scope and budget, suggesting this was nothing imminent. And in the last couple of days, the likes of <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GamingLeaksAndRumours/comments/1p3zwoe/comment/nq8f5f9/">Jason Schreier</a> and <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/grubb.wtf/post/3m6ajw5exkk2p">Jeff Grubb</a> have been telling people that there’s no chance of seeing the game before 2027. (Thanks&nbsp;<a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/naughty-dogs-intergalactic-the-heretic-prophet-reportedly-still-years-from-release-and-dont-expect-to-see-it-at-the-game-awards"><em>IGN</em></a>.)</p>

 <p>Grubb went further, posting to BlueSky that not only is the game likely a couple of years away, but also that “it will not be shown at The Game Awards.”</p>   <p>They were responding to a rumor that spread from an <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/intergalactic-the-heretic-prophet-2026-release-report/"><em>Insider Gaming</em> article</a>, citing a&nbsp;recent episode of the Dan Allen Gaming podcast, in which former IGN editor and podcast host Colin Moriarty said he&nbsp;“believe[d]” the game would appear at The Game Awards, and called <em>Intergalactic</em> “content complete.” “I think next year it’ll be good to go,” he said, explaining that he had heard from people who’d “interacted with the game,” and based on Naughty Dog hiring for localization.</p> <div role="listitem" aria-roledescription="message" data-qa-hover="true" data-qa="virtual-list-item" data-qa-unprocessed="false" data-qa-placeholder="false" id="message-list_1763995661.805549" tabindex="-1" aria-setsize="-1" data-item-key="1763995661.805549"> <p>This inspired others to jump in and suggest the complete opposite, with Moriarty himself saying they were just personal speculation. But if we know anything in 2025, it’s that big games take <em>forever</em> to make, with colossal budgets and enormous scope meaning entire businesses ride or die on their individual success. <em>Intergalactic</em> will appear when it’s good and ready, no matter how frustrating that might be for us as we impatiently wait for more details.</p> </div>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/grand-theft-auto-6-union-firing-rockstar-protests-2000646881</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/grand-theft-auto-6-rockstar-fired-union-workers-legal-2000643030"><span>Rockstar fired 34 developers back in October</span></a><span>. While Rockstar claims these </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/gta-6-rockstar-games-union-busting-delay-2000640525"><span>people were fired for “gross misconduct</span></a><span>” over allegedly sharing company secrets, the former employees claim the company was union-busting. Now, according to a new </span><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8TvWNFBBwuY"><i><span>People Make Games</span></i></a> <span>report, the entire saga actually started after Rockstar started cracking down on developers communicating about non-work topics in the company Slack.</span></p> <p><i><span>People Make Games </span></i><span>posted a new video that includes alleged messages from the Rockstar union workers’ private Discord server where members discussed conditions at the studio, but specifically not the status of projects like the </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/gta-6-grand-theft-auto-vi-delayed-november-rockstar-games-2000641787"><span>recently delayed </span><i><span>Grand Theft Auto 6</span></i></a><span>. One former Rockstar employee claimed the only company information that was shared there were emails about updates to the company’s Slack guidelines following discussions in recently shut down channels.</span></p>

 <p><span>In October, Rockstar reportedly made changes to the company’s Slack, which included removing several miscellaneous channels where employees discussed non-work topics like pets, hobbies, and games they were playing. The “Slack Purge,” as it was called, prompted discussions in an outside union channel on Discord. This was then followed by another change preventing people from using emojis in their Slack statuses, which workers theorized was to prevent people from using the Palestinian flag or the Sprout emoji used to symbolize Union support.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><span>These emails were sent outside of work hours, and Rockstar has systems set up so workers cannot access their work email outside of their office. As such, Union members sent these emails to the Discord so people outside of the office could see their contents, which led to one member of the Discord expressing their concerns to management about the discussions. </span><i><span>PMG</span></i><span> theorizes that Rockstar gained access to the Discord at this point and read the previous chat logs to make a case for firing 34 workers by the end of that month.</span></p>

 <p><span>You can watch the full video below:</span></p>  <p>Rockstar limiting workers’ email access may have started this entire mess, but as&nbsp;<em>People Make Games&nbsp;</em>explains, the company has been the subject of several high profile leaks over the years, including a <a href="https://kotaku.com/gtavi-gta-vi-gta-6-grand-theft-auto-leak-video-dump-1849550414">massive data dump of unfinished <em>Grand Theft Auto 6&nbsp;</em>assets and footage back in 2022</a>. So it’s not entirely surprising that the studio has a lot of internal communications on lock and key to prevent leaks. That being said, as the IWGB Game Workers Union lays out in the video, discussing your working conditions is not the same as freely posting&nbsp;<em>Grand Theft Auto VI&nbsp;</em>footage on a Discord server, and should fall under protected union discussions.</p>

 <p>In the weeks since Rockstar fired these workers, those affected have been holding protests outside both Rockstar and publisher Take Two’s London offices. Despite being fired, several members have expressed a desire to come back and finish working on&nbsp;<em>Grand Theft Auto 6</em>, which is still a year away after its recent delay.</p> <p><strong>Update, 11/24/25, 10:43 a.m. EST: </strong>An IWGB representative has released a statement to <em>Kotaku</em>, claiming the Discord was only used for sharing the information laid out in the&nbsp;<em>PMG</em> video, and that there were “strict policies” against sharing confidential updates on internal projects like&nbsp;<em>Grand Theft Auto 6</em>. The full statement reads as follows:</p> <div dir="auto" data-qa="virtual-list-item" role="listitem" aria-roledescription="message" data-qa-hover="true" data-qa-unprocessed="false" data-qa-placeholder="false" id="message-list_1763998870.447709" tabindex="0" aria-setsize="-1" data-item-key="1763998870.447709"> <p>“Obviously we can’t get in the minds of Rockstar management to know what they were referring to when they referred to leaked information – they’ve provided us with about as much (or less) information than they have put out in public statements. We can confirm that the Discord was only used for discussing information related to organising, such as the decision to remove Slack channels and pay and bonuses as the video mentions, and that there were strict policies about sharing confidential information.”</p> </div>

              <p>The Galaxy Watch 7 is currently <strong>ranked #1 as Amazon’s Best Seller in smartwatches</strong>, ahead of all Apple Watch models. Sales are skyrocketing on Black Friday, with one simple truth: value trumps brand loyalty when the price is right. This <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5766/">2024 model is down to nearly half price at $129 from its original $249 (48% off)</a>. You’re taking here zero risk on a smartwatch that thousands are buying.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5766/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Galaxy AI That Understands Your Body</h2>
<p>It uses <strong>Galaxy AI analysis to calculate your physical readiness</strong> every morning. The watch builds up data on yesterday’s activity, quality of sleep, variation in heart rate, and recovery measures. Your phone then processes the information overnight and gives you a personalized score that lets you know how hard to push today. Low energy days indicate lighter workouts or rest, while high scores show your body is ready for intense training.</p>
<p><strong>Heart rate monitoring gets a serious boost from Galaxy AI</strong> filtering that takes into consideration the movement of the body. Conventional optical sensors are hardly accurate during high-intensity exercises when your arm is always in motion. The Galaxy Watch 7 introduces sophisticated algorithms that separate your actual heart rate signal from motion artifacts. You get reliable readings during high-intensity intervals, running, cycling, and strength training. This kind of accuracy matters when you’re training in specific heart rate zones or monitoring cardiovascular health.</p>



<p>Detailed analysis of sleep stages and quality goes beyond basic time-in-bed measurement. The watch tracks your sleep cycles throughout the night, monitoring light sleep, deep sleep, and REM phases of your sleep. Galaxy AI analyzes this data and gives you meaningful insights into your sleep patterns and habits. This feature screens for moderate to severe sleep apnea that may need medical attention. And you also get personalized recommendations to improve the quality of sleep based on your sleep patterns.</p>
<p>Wellness tips provide <strong>personalized recommendations that adjust to your real behavior and objectives</strong>. Your watch tracks detailed health information all day and night. Your connected phone then uses Galaxy AI to create relevant tips from those insights. Recommendations may include adjusting the time you work out, drinking more water, or going to bed earlier. Advice changes as your habits change and you receive coaching that remains pertinent to your life</p>
<p>Performance tracking lets you compare current workouts to previous efforts in real-time. Running the same route? The watch shows whether you’re ahead or behind your last pace. Cycling your regular loop? See instantly if you’re improving or struggling today. It’s this type of comparative data which encourages you to push that little bit harder or helps you realize when your body might need recovery.</p>



<p>The <strong>40mm case size fits comfortably on smaller wrists</strong> without looking oversized. The Green colorway provides a fresh alternative to standard black and silver options. Battery life reaches approximately <strong>30 hours with typical use</strong>, covering a full day plus some buffer. Charging happens via the included wireless charger that snaps magnetically to the back. <strong>Water resistance up to 5ATM</strong> protects during swimming, showering, and sweaty workouts.</p>
<p>The <strong>touchscreen display stays readable in bright sunlight</strong> and dims automatically in darkened rooms. Rotating bezel navigation comes with tactile control that works with sweaty or gloved fingers. From minimalist time displays to data-rich fitness dashboards, watch faces can be customized as needed. Notification mirroring from your phone keeps you connected without constantly needing to check your device. The <strong>watch works both with Android and iOS</strong>, though Android users get deeper integration features.</p>
<p>The Samsung Galaxy Watch 7 provides AI-powered health tracking at almost half the retail price this Black Friday for $129. This happens to be the #1 best-selling smartwatch on Amazon because the feature-to-price ratio finally makes sense. Want comprehensive health tracking without paying Apple Watch prices? This record-low deal takes every excuse off the table.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/apple-breaks-its-own-pricing-rules-airpods-max-hits-a-wild-black-friday-low-2000646662</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/apple-breaks-its-own-pricing-rules-airpods-max-hits-a-wild-black-friday-low.1362778/</guid>

              <p>Discounts on Apple’s products are few and far between. This is true for both the latest releases and most older generation models that still perform well. But thanks to Black Friday and Cyber Monday, that changes today.</p>
<p>Even though the events are technically still a few days away, early deals have started popping it. There’s a wide range of items to grab, from tech essentials to kitchen appliances, games, outdoor gear, and even toys! We also just spotted Apple AirPods Max — one of the best wireless headphones out there — at a discount.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5865/">These headphones usually sit at $550, but they can be yours for $430 today. That’s after a sweet 22% discount.</a> The offer applies to blue, orange, starlight, and purple color options. Those after the classic black version can grab it for $479. There are no weirdly long coupon codes or complicated checkout processes to worry about. Just add the product to your cart, and the discount applies automatically. Prime members will also enjoy free shipping on their orders.</p>

<h2>Pro-Level Active Noise Cancellation</h2>
<p>The headphones don’t just look good; they are comfortable to wear, too. The pair is designed with a knit-mesh canopy and memory foam ear cushions that fit nicely to seal the sound in. Unlike most over-ear headphones, these don’t apply unnecessary pressure to the ears, which means you can wear them for longer without feeling uneasy.</p>
<p>Carring them around safely won’t be a problem either, thanks to the color-matched smart case that’s included in the box for free. Plus, since there are multiple fresh colors to choose from, you can pick one that suits your aesthetics the best. Like your audio gear a bit on the minimal side? The black or starlight options can be a great pick. Want something with a bit more personality? The purple version is stunning!</p>
<p>Performance-wise, these are packed with a dynamic driver and the Apple H1 chip for rich, high-fidelity audio. There’s Active Noise Cancellation that blocks all background sound for a more immersive experience, even in noisy, chaotic settings. This feature is great for when you really want to focus on a task (or vibe to a track) without any distractions. Just put these on, and block the outside world for as long as you want.</p>



<p>Of course, that doesn’t work for every situation. Sometimes, it’s better to be aware of what’s happening around you. For that, you’ve got the Transparency mode. This one lets ambient sound in while still delivering deep, quality audio. You can enjoy what’s playing, plus stay in touch with the world. This mode is best when you’re travelling and don’t want to miss your stop, or when you’re in a cafe and want to hear the barista call your name.</p>
<p>Spatial Audio is supported, too. This mode pushes sound that suits your unique ear shape for a 3D experience. The headphones are also smart enough to pause the audio automatically when you take them off! Tweaking other settings doesn’t require pulling your phone out, either. You can adjust volume, mute yourself on calls, skip tracks, and more using the digital crown right there on the headphones.</p>
<p>Pairing these with your device is straightforward. You can place the headphones near your iPhone, iPad, or Mac, and just tap Connect on the screen to get started.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5865/">The current deal brings the price of this high-end pair to $430.</a> We know it’s still a bit of an investment, but the discount somewhat makes these a bit more approachable. If you’ve been wanting to grab premium headphones from Apple for less, today is the day to make the move.</p>

              <p>Both storage variants of the Galaxy S25 Ultra have <strong>crashed to all-time low prices</strong> on Amazon for Black Friday: The <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4640/">256GB model drops from $1,299 to $949</a>, while the <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4640/">512GB version falls from $1,419 to $1,019</a>. With these prices well undercutting Samsung’s own website, Amazon is the clear winner on this flagship purchase. At these lower prices, the S25 Ultra competes with the iPhone 17 Pro, and many would argue Samsung gives you more features for less cash.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4640/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Best Smartphone</h2>
<p>The screen of the <strong>6.8-inch Dynamic AMOLED 2X runs at a native 3088 x 1440 resolution</strong> with adaptive <strong>refresh rates from 1Hz to 120Hz</strong>. Lowering its refresh rate to 1Hz while displaying static images, this screen dynamically adjusts its refresh rate depending upon content; it ramps up to 120Hz in the case of gaming and scrolling. The peak brightness goes up to 2600 nits for great outdoor visibility even under direct sunlight. This <strong>display supports HDR10+</strong> for stunning color reproduction in compatible content. It also has the toughened Gorilla Glass Victus 3 to protect it against scratches and drops with undiminished touch sensitivity.</p>
<p>The <strong>Snapdragon 8 Elite for Galaxy chip</strong> represents the most powerful mobile silicon currently available. This custom variant happens to run slightly faster than the standard Snapdragon 8 Elite in other flagship phones. The octa-core architecture handles demanding games and 4K video editing, and heavy multitasking without breaking a sweat. AI processing happens locally on the device through dedicated neural processing cores.</p>



<p><strong>Battery capacity reaches 5000mAh</strong> to provide all-day endurance even for demanding users. This efficient processor and adaptive display work together to make the most of your day. <strong>Fast 45W charging takes the phone from zero to 65% in about 30 minutes</strong>. Wireless charging at 15W offers cable-free convenience when at a desk or nightstand. You will be able to top up Galaxy Buds or a friend’s phone by merely placing them on the back of your S25 Ultra with reverse wireless charging.</p>
<p>The camera system consists of a <strong>quad-lens setup that competes with independent cameras</strong>: The primary 200MP wide sensor captures exceptional detail that can be used for aggressive cropping without losing quality. A 50MP periscope telephoto delivers 5x optical zoom on subjects far away. The secondary telephoto provides 3x optical zoom for portraits and shots in the middle distance; it has a resolution of 10MP. The 12MP ultra-wide captures wide-screen shots with a field of view up to 120 degrees.</p>
<p>Video capabilities <strong>encompass 8K recording at 30fps or 4K at 60fps with exceptional stabilization</strong>. Super Steady video mode removes shake during walking or running. Director’s View lets one see all camera angles simultaneously and seamlessly switch between views when recording. Pro video controls give filmmakers manual exposure, focus, and audio level adjustments.</p>
<p>The <strong>built-in S Pen</strong> turns this phone into a productivity powerhouse: Taking handwritten notes feels natural on the responsive stylus, feeling like pen-on-paper feedback. Annotate screenshots, sign documents, and even sketch out your next idea without needing any extra accessories. The pen stores inside the phone body, where it is always ready should inspiration strike.</p>
<p>Starting at $949 for 256GB or $1,019 for 512GB, Galaxy S25 Ultra offers flagship performance that has never been this affordable on Black Friday. If you want the best Android phone available, period, these record-low prices finally make the premium features accessible.</p>
