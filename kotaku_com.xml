              <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-shiny-odds-scarlet-violet-ivs-red-gyarados-1850248457"><span>Shiny hunters</span></a><span> are Arceus’ strongest soldiers in the </span><i><span>Pokémon </span></i><span>community, but I think we may have found the strongest among them. One fan did a somewhat unorthodox Shiny hunt not in one of the </span><i><span>Pokémon </span></i><span>RPGs, but in a 20-year-old battle simulator spin-off on the Wii. Collecting these alternate-colored monsters in it is far more complicated than doing so in your average </span><i><span>Pokémon </span></i><span>game.</span></p> <p><span>User Noa_Kyogre on X (thanks, </span><a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/pokemon/pokemon-player-spends-5-years-completing-one-of-the-weirdest-shiny-hunts-in-history-immediately-promises-to-never-do-it-again/"><i><span>Gamesradar</span></i></a><span>) took five years to find Shiny costumes in </span><i><span>Pokémon Battle Revolution</span></i><span>. The Wii game doesn’t have wild Pokémon encounters, but its various trainers can dress up as monsters if the player chooses to wear themed outfits based on creatures like Groudon, Kyogre, Roserade, and Lucario. However, it’s possible to find these outfits in their respective Pokémon’s Shiny colors, such as a yellow-and-green Lucario rather than its usual blue-and-black color scheme. It will just take you thousands of hours of playtime to do it.</span></p>

 <p><span>You can acquire these outfits by beating a trainer wearing them in the game’s single-player mode, but each of these trainers shows up during what is essentially a long boss rush of high-level battles, and their outfits have as little a chance of changing as a rare Pokémon has of showing up in a base game. That’s a roughly 1 in 8192 spawn chance.&nbsp;</span></p> <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="ja" dir="ltr">ポケモンバトルレボリューション (通称バトレボ)<br>日本語版と海外版 それぞれで色違いコスチューム コンプリートしました！😋💫<br>多分、史上初だと思います🤔<br>海外版は肌の色が3種類から選べるので褐色ガチ神！😍<br>多分5〜6年ぐらいこの厳選やってました！🤣<a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/%E8%89%B2%E9%81%95%E3%81%84%E3%83%9D%E3%82%B1%E3%83%A2%E3%83%B3?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#色違いポケモン</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/ShinyPokemon?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#ShinyPokemon</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/Shinyhunt?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#Shinyhunt</a> <a href="https://t.co/20K0tvLc9F">pic.twitter.com/20K0tvLc9F</a></p> <p>— のあ (@Noa_Kyogre) <a href="https://twitter.com/Noa_Kyogre/status/2020371004934221837?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">February 8, 2026</a></p></blockquote>  <p><span>So, if you want to Shiny hunt these outfits, you’ll have to reload and fight through these battles over and over just to get one of them. That wasn’t enough for Noa_Kyogre, who has collected the full set of six, not once but twice, and asserts they are the first person to do so. The double dipping came from finding the full set in both the Japanese and international versions of the game.</span></p>

 <p><span>It’s definitely worth the bragging rights, but is it worth the likely insanity you’ll subject yourself to in order to get it? Probably not, and Noa_Kyogre says they will </span><a href="https://x.com/Noa_Kyogre/status/2020382448736207114?s=20"><span>never do it again</span></a><span>. I’m surprised they didn’t come to that conclusion the first time through.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><i><span>Pokémon Battle Revolution </span></i><span>was pretty maligned back in the day for being more of a battle simulator than a full-blown game, but it does still have some of the </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-battle-revolution-animations-wii-scarlet-violet-1850362666"><span>best animations of the series’ 3D games</span></a><span>. It really captured each monster’s personality in a way that doesn’t come across in games like </span><i><span>Scarlet </span></i><span>and </span><i><span>Violet</span></i><span>, but it also had the benefit of a much smaller Pokémon selection than most modern games. </span><i><span>Pokémon Champions</span></i><span>, the Switch and mobile battle simulator </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-champions-legends-z-a-presents-day-stream-1851766818"><span>coming later this year</span></a><span>, is essentially its spiritual successor, and will act as the battle platform for competitive </span><i><span>Pokémon </span></i><span>moving forward.</span></p>

            <title><![CDATA[The Binding Of Isaac Dev’s New Game Takes 500 Hours To Complete And Will Take Players ‘Months or Years’ To Find All Of Its Secrets]]></title>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><span>On Tuesday, </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/mewgenics-edmund-mcmillen-roguelike-impressions-2000666865"><i><span>Mewgenics</span></i></a><span>, the tactical RPG-slash-life-sim roguelite about breeding and battling cats, created by developers behind </span><i><span>The Binding of Isaac </span></i><span>and </span><i><span>Closure</span></i><span>, launched and almost immediately shot to the top of Steam’s charts. </span><i><span>Mewgenics </span></i><span>seems like it’s shaping up to be the next big hit for roguelite sickos, in no small part thanks to how absolutely massive its scope is.</span></p> <p><span>In </span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/SteamDeck/comments/1qzfwae/edmund_mcmillen_here_mewgenics_is_steam_deck/"><span>an AMA on the Steam Deck subreddit</span></a><span> over the weekend, developers Edmund McMillen and Tyler Glaiel teamed up to answer fans’ questions about the game, and they revealed that it’s a </span><i><span>lot </span></i><span>larger than anyone previously expected. In one response, McMillen referred to the game as “one of the largest tactical RPGs of all time.” In another, he revealed that “it will take an average player about 200+ hours to ‘beat the game’ and 500+ hours to 100% :)” (thanks, </span><em><a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/roguelike/its-going-to-take-you-over-500-hours-to-100-percent-complete-mewgenics-according-to-creator-edmund-mcmillen/"><span>PC Gamer</span></a></em><span>).</span></p>

 <p><span>Judging by the game’s 281 Steam achievements and the fact that it has 1,000 unique abilities to unlock, that estimate doesn’t sound like much of a stretch. And it seems like </span><i><span>Mewgenics</span></i><span>’ most dedicated players might end up pouring quite a few extra hours into hunting for secrets. According to Glaiel, “there’s a lot of little things that I think people will be discovering for months or years. But we will reserve the true ARG level stuff for DLC.” (thanks, </span><em><a href="https://www.polygon.com/mewgenics-dlc-secret-unlock-arg-binding-of-issac/"><span>Polygon</span></a></em><span>).</span></p> <p><span>While the base game’s absurd length should tide players over for a long time, McMillen also said the team is planning on beginning work on the game’s DLC in the next few months, with a planned release around a year later. McMillen also hinted that a Switch 2 port might be on its way. The game is currently only available on PC.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <h2>From delayed development to the top of the charts</h2> <p><i><span>Mewgenics </span></i><span>was announced all the way back in 2012, but the project entered a long period of development hell (and was even cancelled at one point). Despite the game’s wildly tumultuous development cycle, it’s </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/mewgenics-edmund-mcmillen-roguelike-impressions-2000666865"><span>apparently pretty good</span></a><span>. It’s currently the <a href="https://www.metacritic.com/browse/game/all/all/current-year/">highest-rated game</a> on Metacritic for the year so far. If <em>Binding of Isaac</em>‘s trajectory <a href="https://kotaku.com/binding-of-isaac-designers-new-game-is-both-uncomfortab-1728533526">is any indication</a>, this is only the start of a long and wild post-launch life for <em>Mewgenics</em>.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><span>I haven’t had a chance to pick up the game yet, but I’ve been having a blast watching players share their freakish findings online all day. Even McMillen couldn’t resist sharing some of his own discoveries in the AMA—he wrote: “my nephew Eli had one where he could punch one of his other cats in the face and it would send out 1000 sparkles to totally destroy all enemies instantly…the game is so insane man, you don’t even know.”</span></p>
