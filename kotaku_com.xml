It’s Pokémon Day, which commemorates the anniversary of the launch of the original <em>Pokemon Red</em> and <em>Green </em>in Japan in 1996. Each year, The Pokémon Company puts on a livestream to talk about upcoming games, updates on current ones, and other projects within the franchise. Last year’s was a little lowkey because it was the first year in a while that Game Freak didn’t release a new RPG or DLC, but this year, the studio is releasing <em>Pokémon Legends: Z-A</em>, the second installment in the <em>Legends </em>subseries set in Kalos. That wasn’t the only announcement, although things were still pretty quiet. If you want to watch the full livestream, you can check that out below. If you just want the highlights, read on:</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="8847c43705ebfb4c498387d5ccccde5c" data-recommend-id="image://8847c43705ebfb4c498387d5ccccde5c" data-format="jpg" data-width="1991" data-height="1120" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Arcanine in Pokemon Concierge." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Arcanine in Pokemon Concierge." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="false" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->The Pokémon Company</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="8847c43705ebfb4c498387d5ccccde5c" data-recommend-id="image://8847c43705ebfb4c498387d5ccccde5c" data-format="jpg" data-width="1991" data-height="1120" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Arcanine in Pokemon Concierge." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>First up was the announcmenet that the second season of <em>Pokemon Concierge</em>, the excellent stop-motion Netflix series, will premiere in September.

A Unova Go Tour is taking place on March 1 and 2, and will include Black Kyurem and White Kyurem in raid battles. Shiny Meloetta and Victini will also be available during this time.</p></div><div><p>Two new sync pairs are coming to the gacha game <em>Pokemon Masters EX</em>: May and Shiny Primal Kyogre and Brendan and Shiny Primal Groudon. May will join tomorrow, February 28, with Brendan following on March 2. </p></div><div><p>Puzzle game <em>Pokémon Cafe Remix </em>is getting an apple-based event on Friday, February 28, which will allow you to add either Appletun or Flapple join your staff. The event also includes outfit packs for Sprigatitto, Fuecoco, and Quaxly. </p></div><div><p>Darkrai and Cresselia are coming to <em>Pokemon Sleep</em>. Not much is known about their appearance, but they’re both known for being able to affect dreams and nightmares, so they’re appropriate for a sleep app.</p></div><div><p>Three new Pokemon are coming to the MOBA <em>Pokemon Unite</em>. Suicune, Alolan Raichu, and Alcremie are all joining the roster in March, April, and “soon,” respectively. Also, a new mode called First to 500 is coming, which requires either team to reach 500 points through scoring goals.</p></div><div><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/pokemon-tcg-pocket-triumphant-light-arceus-leak-rank-1851766589&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-tcg-pocket-triumphant-light-arceus-leak-rank-1851766589">As previously leaked</a></span>, <em>Pokemon Trading Card Game Pocket </em>is getting a new booster set called Triumphant Light. The Arceus-centric set will be added to the app tomorrow, February 28.</p></div><div><p>Outside of the app, we also saw some new Mega Evolution ex cards coming to the standard Trading Card Game. The only two we saw were Mega Lucario and Mega Gardevoir, but more will be added, as well.</p></div><div><p>After some updates on some small events in <em>Scarlet </em>and <em>Violet</em>, we got into a brand new game called <em>Pokémon Champions</em>. The Switch and mobile game was only shown through a cinematic teaser, but it was described as a core-style battle simulator outside of the typical RPG structure. It’s being developed by Pokémon Works, and will let you connect to <em>Pokémon Home</em> to import your parties from mainline games.</p></div><div><p>Closing out the show was <em>Pokémon Legends: Z-A</em>. The Switch RPG deviates from <em>Legends: Arceus</em>, in that it takes place in modern day Kalos, rather than a historical setting. Your character will start their journey with either Chikorita, Totodile, or Tepig, while Lumiose City is undergoing an urban redevelopment plan. There will be discreet wild areas where you can capture more Pokémon, but it doesn’t seem like <em>Z-A</em> will include the open zones of <em>Arceus</em>. The game will launch on Switch in late 2025.</p><p>.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Before today, all we knew about the Switch game was what was revealed on Pokémon Day 2024. <em>Legends Z-A</em> is set entirely in the Kalos metropolis of Lumiose City, which debuted in <em>Pokémon X </em>and <em>Y</em> back in 2013. Now, we’ve finally seen the game in motion and, despite sharing the <em>Legends</em> name, it seems like a far cry from <em>Pokémon Legends: Arceus</em>’ open-zone structure.</p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="196165" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="What’s Coming Out Beyond Pokémon: The Indigo Disk | The Week In Games" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="95" data-playlist="196165,195519,195905" data-current="196165"><div><p>What’s Coming Out Beyond Pokémon: The Indigo Disk | The Week In Games</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196165/196165_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196165/196165_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196165/196165_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196165/196165_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/21711.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>Unlike the countryside setting of the past game, <em>Pokémon Legends: Z-A </em>revolves around Lumiose City which is currently undergoing a major urban renewal program with new construction and skyscrapers going up. More importantly, players will get to choose from Gen 2 and Gen 5 starters Chikorita, Tepig, or Totodile during their adventures. The hybrid turn-based combat also looks a bitt different this time around. The game won’t arrive until late 2025.</p><p>One of the major mechanics in <em>Pokémon Legends: Z-A </em>is the return of Mega Evolution. These superpowered forms transform regular fully-evolved critters into somewhat overdesigned versions of themselves for a hefty (but temporary) stat boost. It’s unclear if we’ll be getting new Mega Evolutions in <em>Legends: Z-A</em>, however.</p><p><em>Pokémon Legends: Z-A</em> is probably one of the last <em>Pokémon </em>RPGs that will be developed for the Switch before the Switch 2 launches later this year. However, it will also be playable on the new device, which will play original Switch games through backward compatibility. So maybe we’ll see it running on the more powerful hardware when Nintendo holds a dedicated Direct presentation <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/nintendo-direct-switch-2-release-date-april-2025-1851740848&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/nintendo-direct-switch-2-release-date-april-2025-1851740848">in April</a></span>. </p><p>.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Robertson is part of the team pitching Ludoscene, a web browser app that uses gaming experts to curate thousands of games users might want to play based on the ones they already like as well as on factors like platform, genre, and other preferences. “We wanted to have a system where it could be much more eclectic, and there’ll be a much greater chance that you’ll encounter games that you probably would never encounter if you just looked at what was popular on Steam or Xbox,” he said. </p><p> The project currently has a <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/ludocene/ludocene-game-discovery-from-people-you-trust&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/ludocene/ludocene-game-discovery-from-people-you-trust" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">crowdfunding campaign on Kickstarter</a></span> with the hope of launching the initial version later this year. There are three main components to building Ludoscene. The first is human curators like <em>My Perfect Console</em> podcast host Simon Parkin and <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/videoverse-game-review-online-gaming-forums-vn-kinmoku-1850780173&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/videoverse-game-review-online-gaming-forums-vn-kinmoku-1850780173"><em>Videoverse</em></a></span> designer Lucy Bundell. The second is a database of great games with over 3,000 entries categorized based on the team’s input. And finally there’s the creative interface: a <em>Balatro</em>-like deck of cards you slowly build up by swiping based on what you like and don’t like. </p><p>It reminds me of a scene from <em>Halt and Catch Fire</em>, the cult AMC drama about the rise of computers, in which Lee Pace is filling up a whiteboard with colorful post-it notes in an attempt to fully map out the nascent world wide web in the early ‘90s. Before Google used algorithms to sort everything and eventually ended up breaking the internet in the process, life online was catalogued and curated by regular people just looking to connect over shared passions and hobbies. It’s inefficient and clumsy but also more intimate and meaningful. </p><p>I have no idea if Ludoscene could be that for game recommendations but it could certainly be the start of trying to move game discovery and recommendations back toward something more personal and authentic. And unlike mapping the entire internet, you only need a dozen really good game recommendations to keep you busy for a long time. The dating-app-like aspect of just getting presented with one choice at a time rather than being bombarded with 100 critically acclaimed games from the last five years is also very appealing. </p><p>The plans for Ludoscene also sound quite robust. It’s not just giving you names of games to go look up later. You can flip each game’s card over and see quick snippets of actual gameplay taken from trailers, what platforms the game is on, its price, and links to immediately go buy and download it on the platform of your choice. It’ll also tell you if the game is available on one of the subscription services like Game Pass or PS Plus so you know before spending the money.</p><p>“There’s quite a lot of nice,  ongoing curation so it really is about creating a relationship person to person, both in terms of game suggestions and the experts, which is quite a different approach to just purely algorithms, or  just using tags to try to float stuff up to the top, which works for some games, but not for others,” Robertson said. “It’s really about that human connection.” The team is looking at recruiting more than the few dozen experts it’s currently working with and hopes that personal touch will be a big part of Ludoscene’s draw.</p><p>Another thing the project has going for it is just how terrible the existing storefronts are at showing players games they might like. Despite years of information on what I own and play, the PlayStation Store, Microsoft Store, and Switch eShop are effectively useless when it comes to browsing for anything outside of broad genres and the games that are already popular in them. Steam is much better relatively speaking, but still not great in the broader scheme of things.  Ludoscene sounds like a good antidote to those shortcomings. </p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
