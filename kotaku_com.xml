              <p>If you’re planning an outdoor adventure or just live in an area that’s prone to power outages, having a power station at hand can be a true lifesaver. The best options out there not just keep your essentials charged, but are also easy to carry around.</p>
<p>EcoFlow makes some of our favorite portable options, and Amazon is making it easy to grab one without shelling out thousands of dollars.<a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5693/"> Right now, you can grab the EcoFlow Delta 2 power station for just $349, after a massive 50% off its retail price.</a> It’s one of the lowest drops we’ve seen in a while, but it won’t last long. If you’ve been holding off on buying backup power, this is a good time to make the move.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5693/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Multiple Ports to Juice All Your Essentials</h2>
<p>This mighty station offers up to 1800W of output to power 90% of your home appliances. It comes with 15 ports in total, which include 6 AC outlets (1800W, 2700W surge), 2 USB-C (100W), 2 USB-A (12W), 2 USB-A Fast Charge (18W), 2 DC5521 (38W), and 1 car charger port (126W). That’s enough to power your smartphone, laptop, fridge, projector, and even a coffee maker at the same time.</p>
<p>It can prepare you for up to two days of backup during a power outage. For reference, the EcoFlow Delta 2 can keep a refrigerator (120W) going for up to 14 hours, power a CPAP machine (40W) for 17 hours, run a light (10W) for up to 98 hours, and even let you heat food in a microwave for up to 0.6 hours.</p>



<p>Its LFP(LiFePO4) battery delivers more than 3,000 charge cycles and is built to last for years. Recharging the power station can be done in multiple ways. You can charge the EcoFlow Delta 2 from 0 to 100% in just 1.3 hours using a wall outlet. It also supports solar (2.3 hrs), car, and smart generator charging. Overall, the recharging time is about 7 times faster than many other units in this range, so it should be up and running again in no time.</p>
<p>The box comes with everything you need to get started, including the EcoFlow Delta 2 portable power station, an AC charging cable, a user manual, and an exclusive 5-year customer service for some extra peace of mind. It’s better to get your orders in quickly, as the deal can vanish at any moment now.</p>

              <p>The Nintendo GameCube’s <em>Kirby Air Ride</em> seems to have become more popular in people’s memories than it was on its 2003 launch. The racing game from HAL Laboratory and&nbsp;<em>Super Smash Bros.</em> legend&nbsp;Masashiro Sakurai was received with a collective “meh,” reviewers frustrated by its simplicity in a world where <em>Mario Kart</em> ruled. This seems to have done little to <a href="https://kotaku.com/kirby-air-riders-switch-2-release-date-nintendo-direct-trailer-2000618410">dampen excitement</a> around the game’s very belated return, this time in the hands of Bandai Namco and Sora, complete with Masashiro Sakurai at the helm. And it seems to have worked out a lot better 22 years later, with&nbsp;<em>Kirby Air Riders</em> winning over a majority of critics.</p> <p>The game’s <a href="https://www.metacritic.com/game/kirby-air-riders/critic-reviews/?platform=nintendo-switch-2">current Metascore of 78</a> isn’t what Sora or Nintendo would have been hoping for, but it’s a fair reflection of the 57 reviews in so far (Nintendo did not supply&nbsp;<em>Kotaku</em> with review code), with its vast majority of 7s, 8s and 9s. Funnily enough, 78 is exactly where&nbsp;<a href="https://kotaku.com/zelda-switch-2-hyrule-warriors-age-imprisonment-reviews-metacritic-2000641055"><em>Hyrule Warriors: Age of Imprisonment</em></a> landed earlier this month, a number that has only snuck up to 79 since its release. Also aligning is each game’s harshest review, with both getting a huge outlier score of 4 out of 10 and verbal kicking from the anonymous critic at the UK’s&nbsp;<em><a href="https://metro.co.uk/2025/11/19/kirby-air-riders-review-nintendos-pink-puffball-rides-24741030/">Metro Game Central</a></em>. (<em>Metro</em> is owned by Associated Newspapers, the same company that owns the&nbsp;<em>Daily Mail</em>.) Meanwhile, I suspect that had Julia Lee’s review on <a href="https://www.polygon.com/kirby-air-riders-review/"><em>Polygon</em></a> had a score it could have weighted things up significantly, given she describes the game as “everything I could have wanted and more.”&nbsp;<em>Siliconera</em>‘s Jenni Lada was equally jubilant, with a 10/10 score and the declaration that she likes it more than&nbsp;<em>Mario Kart World</em>!</p>

 <p>Most took a more moderate view, however, a huge number of the reviews beginning by their confusion that that is of all GameCube games should be the one picked for a modern revival, but pleasantly surprised by the results. “This is a chaotic and frenzied racer, there’s no doubt,” said&nbsp;<a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/nintendo-switch-2/kirby-air-riders"><em>Nintendo Life</em></a>‘s PJ O’Reilly, “but it’s got depth for those who wish to learn and plenty of competition to be had both online and at harder difficulties for diehards.” O’Reilly admits that he had a soft spot for the original, while acknowledging its flaws, and observing that the sequel is “actually very good.” <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/review/kirby-air-riders-review/"><em>VGC</em></a>‘s Chris Scullion says that while the game begins “insultingly simple,” it quickly reveals hidden depths and has a “brilliant single-player Road Trip mode.”</p>

 <p><a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/11/19/kirby-air-riders-review/"><em>The Sixth Axis</em></a>‘s Dominic L was a little more hesitant with praise, criticizing&nbsp;<em>Kirby Air Riders</em>‘ City Trial mode but celebrating its top-down Top Ride perspective, eventually concluding that while falling short of&nbsp;<em>Mario Kart</em> and&nbsp;<em>Sonic Racing: Crossworlds</em>, it’s “undeniably charming.” Meanwhile,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.digitallydownloaded.net/2025/11/review-kirby-air-riders-nintendo-switch-2.html"><em>Digitally Downloaded</em></a>‘s Matt S. said the racer is “fun” but “not any more than that.” Labeling the game “filler,” but conceding it’s “a fun distraction and the kind of thing you’ll pick up every six months or so for a quick blast and laugh.”</p> <p>Here’s a selection of what other sites that Nintendo likes better than us are saying about&nbsp;<em>Kirby Air Riders</em>.</p> <h2><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/kirby-air-riders-review-ter-rick-fic/1900-6418443/"><em>GameSpot</em></a></h2> <blockquote><p>“<em>Kirby Air Riders</em> is an impressive package that makes the most of its deceivingly simple mechanics. Air Ride delivers a solid kart racing experience; Top Ride is a fun–albeit a bit straightforward–distraction; City Trial is chaotic in the best way possible; and Road Trip ties it all together with its creative encounters and satisfying progression. In the second <em>Kirby Air Riders Direct</em>, Masahiro Sakurai said he had no plans to continue the franchise or add any DLC. When I first heard this, I was a little disappointed, but now that I’ve spent countless hours exploring each mode, there’s not really anything else I could want. This feels like that initial concept from 2003 taken as far as it could possibly go, and I couldn’t be happier with the result.” — Jake Dekker</p></blockquote> <h2><a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/kirby-air-riders-review"><em>IGN</em></a></h2> <blockquote><p>“I’m not sure what’s crazier: the fact that <em>Kirby Air Riders</em> exists, or the fact that it’s this great. It’s a blast in local or online multiplayer during its traditional races and unique battle mode, and its frankly absurd amount of fun achievements to chase, meaningful unlockables, and deep customization makes it great for solo players, too.” — Logan Plant</p></blockquote> <h2><a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/review/kirby-air-riders-review/"><em>VGC</em></a></h2> <blockquote><p>“As someone who had a reasonable enough time with the original <em>Kirby Air Rider</em> [sic] on the GameCube, I’d be lying if I said it was top of my list of classic Nintendo games that I wanted to see making a comeback (Punch-Out, Excite Truck and Kid Icarus, please if you’re reading this, Furukawa-san). But Kirby Air Riders is a pleasant surprise that may have some rather eccentric design choices at times – especially in its anticlimactic City Trial mode – but is a great little racing game with engaging and replay-friendly solo modes.” — Chris Scullion</p></blockquote> <h2><a href="https://www.siliconera.com/review-i-love-kirby-air-riders-more-than-mario-kart-world/"><em>Siliconera</em></a></h2> <blockquote><p>“I knew I’d like&nbsp;<em>Kirby Air Riders,&nbsp;</em>since I enjoyed the GameCube original, but I didn’t expect this game to feel stronger than&nbsp;<em>Mario Kart World</em>. It’s so enjoyable and robust. There’s room for both racers on the Switch 2, of course. But if I had to pick a favorite and never touch the other game again, I’d pick&nbsp;<em>Kirby Air Riders&nbsp;</em>every time. There’s so much to do, and every mode feels well-realized and valuable.” — Jenni Lada</p></blockquote> <h2><a href="https://www.thegamer.com/kirby-air-riders-review/"><em>TheGamer</em></a></h2> <blockquote><p>“Game director&nbsp;Masahiro Sakurai’s charm and endless attention to detail is felt throughout <em>Air Riders</em>, but City Trial has it flooding out of every pore. At first, it feels like pure chaos and arguably a bit pointless, but as you figure out stats, Machines, and embrace every random event instead of playing it safe, City Trial becomes the standout mode of <em>Air Riders</em>. Even with just one map and some events feeling too luck-based, it simply never gets boring.” — George Foster</p></blockquote> <h2><a href="https://metro.co.uk/2025/11/19/kirby-air-riders-review-nintendos-pink-puffball-rides-24741030/"><em>Metroid Game Central</em></a></h2> <blockquote><p>“Kirby Air Ride was a fundamentally flawed concept 22 years ago and it has not aged well. Especially as the three main modes are all more or less exactly as they were over two decades ago, to the point where this is really more of a remake than a sequel… If, however, you want to play an irritating, formless, racer that’s simultaneously overcomplicated and far too simple then <em>Kirby Air Riders</em> is the game for you.”</p></blockquote>

              <p>Black Friday is still a week away, but you don’t have to wait for the main event to start saving. Plenty of early deals are live across a wide range of categories at almost all big retailers, which also makes it a great time to grab some premium laptops for less.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5690/">We just spotted the 15-inch Lenovo IdeaPad Slim 3 going for $650 on Amazon, after 35% off its retail price of $999</a>. It’s a powerful and reliable option for both everyday work and play, but the offer is only around for a short time. Act fast before the price shoots back up. There’s no telling if the discount will be back for the main sale event, or if the stock will last till then.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5690/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Spacious Display for Immersive Visuals</h2>
<p>It’s a slim laptop, but the build quality is seriously impressive. The military-grade, durable build protects it from everyday wear and tear well, while also keeping it lightweight enough to carry around with you on the go. Open it up and you’re greeted with a nice 15.3-inch WUXGA display that’s both bright and spacious. Visuals stay clean and sharp for all your content, plus the anti-glare coating keeps reflections at bay. You can use the screen comfortably in both bright and dim settings.</p>
<p>The full-size numeric keyboard makes typing long documents a breeze. It’s not backlit, but since the screen is quite bright, you won’t really have a problem using it after the shadows fall. The machine’s also got a high-quality 720p HD camera paired with an integrated digital microphone for crisp video calls. You will look your best and be heard properly, too.</p>



<p>Performance-wise, the laptop runs on an efficient <strong>AMD Ryzen 5 7535HS processor</strong> that can handle all your everyday tasks like a pro. The <strong>24GB DDR5 SDRAM</strong> lets you multitask without slowing down, and the <strong>built-in 1TB SSD</strong> makes it easy to store all your work documents, media content, programs, and even games at a single place.</p>
<p>Connectivity options include Wi-Fi 6, Bluetooth 5.3, plus a whole bunch of ports, including two USB-A (USB 5Gbps / USB 3.2 Gen 1), one USB-C (USB 5Gbps / USB 3.2 Gen 1), with USB PD 3.0 and DisplayPort 1.2, one HDMI 1.4, one Headphone/microphone combo jack (3.5mm), one SD card reader, and one Power connector. Windows 11 Pro also comes pre-installed, so the laptop will be ready to use right out of the box.</p>

              <p>I find the Entertainment Software Association’s (ESA) surveys weirdly depressing. Not because of their contents—they are in fact usually incredibly spiriting and positive—but because of how they are wholly ignored by the worldwide media in favor of reporting on video games as either a peculiar niche or a lethal scourge. Facts like how the average age of a games player is 41, demographics split almost 50:50 men and women, and 80 percent of people play games socially, go routinely ignored. The latest data you won’t be seeing recalled on your favorite morning news show is that a significant majority of children wish their parents would play video games <em>with</em> them. Oh, and also that they give them money to spend <em>in</em> them.</p> <p><a href="https://www.theesa.com/what-do-kids-want-for-holiday-gifts-video-games-of-course-they-also-want-their-parents-to-game-alongside-them/">This ESA latest holiday survey</a>, conducted with YouGov, spoke to 1,912 people aged 5 to 65, to find out what kids want to find under their tree this year. And, <a href="https://kotaku.com/video-game-esa-report-digital-currency-vbucks-christmas-1851049230">like in 2023</a>, it found that most kids want video games and video game-related currency. 58 percent of children are putting games on their wish list, meaning games are the third most popular desire after money and gift cards (69 percent) and clothing or accessories (63 percent). And as we’ve seen previously, it’s primarily not a new physical game that kids are after, but rather in-game currency.</p>

 <p>43 percent will be asking for money to spend in a game they already own (be it Vbux, Robux, G-tag Shinies, etc), compared to 39 percent who are after a new console, and just 37 percent looking for a new physical game. 32 percent, meanwhile, are looking for an in-game subscription.</p>

 <p>The boy/girl split has become far more stark in 2025, however. This year 76 percent of boys aged 5 to 17 want something video game-related, while only 39 percent of girls have it on their letter to Santa. In <a href="https://www.theesa.com/u-s-children-say-they-want-video-games-more-than-anything-else-this-holiday-season/">2023</a> it was 59 percent of girls. In <a href="https://www.theesa.com/video-games-top-kids-wish-lists-this-holiday-season/">2024</a> it was 67 percent. So what on Earth has happened in the last year to see that number plummet? Well, the best explanation I can find is that this year’s survey has expanded its age range to include 5 to 9-year-olds as well, and perhaps younger girls are less interested and so skewing the numbers.</p>

 <p>But what stands out most to me is the data that more than half of children say they want to play more video games with their parents. 58 percent, in fact. Obviously those numbers drop off significantly as kids get older, but among 5 to 7-year-olds, an astonishing 73 percent say they want their parents to play alongside them more. It’s still 66 percent aged 8 to 9, and 62 percent for kids aged 10 to 12. (The ESA doesn’t include 12 to 17 numbers, so we can assume it sharply drops off at that point in order to get the overall figure down to 58 percent.)</p>

 <p>Play games with your kids! They want you to! Not only is it the most effective way of negating harm—being able to help moderate mood, better control screen time, and intervene when online issues arise—but it’s a wonderful way to bond. Sure,&nbsp;<em>Minecraft</em> might not be your number one choice of game to play, but let them bring you in, show you their builds, challenge them to some PvP, suggest going on a diamond hunt, or have a house-building competition. Yes, you may suck at&nbsp;<em>Fortnite</em>, but play in Duos and let them teach you, revive you, and put the blame on you when you lose in third place. Even just using the app to stream what they’re playing in VR to your phone can make that a shared experience, kids delighted to have you discover the otherwise secret worlds.</p> <p>The ESA is obviously a biased source, given it’s a trade association for the industry, the cause of E3, and indeed <a href="https://kotaku.com/classic-games-history-foundation-preservation-yakuza-1850623857">a regressive force against games preservation</a>, but its surveys do tend to be based on solid data. Data I wish the broader media would bother reading.</p>

              <p>Star Wars is the absolute number one licensed franchise for LEGO and the <strong>Millennium Falcon remains their best-selling model</strong>, year after year. Fans continue to return to Han Solo’s iconic ship because it encapsulates everything they love about the saga. This <em>25th Anniversary</em> edition captures the vessel as it appeared in <em>A New Hope</em> and gives you the chance to own a piece of Star Wars history without breaking the bank: Amazon <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4190/">has cut the price to $67, down from its usual $84, and marks an all-time low for Black Friday</a>.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4190/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>
Build Your Way Into the Star Wars Universe</h2>
<p>Get ready to embark on a construction journey through one of cinema’s most recognizable spacecraft with this <strong>921-piece set</strong>. The build process reproduces the signature features of the Falcon in LEGO form: from the forward-facing <strong>cockpit that Han and Chewie piloted</strong> through asteroid fields and Imperial blockades, to the circular satellite dish resting atop the hull and quad laser cannons positioned for defense</p>
<p>In this way, the included display stand elevates this model beyond a simple toy into proper home décor. Lego designed it to angle the Falcon in such a way that creates visual interest from any viewing position in your room.<strong> A nameplate identifies the ship</strong>&nbsp;and a special 25th Anniversary brick commemorates a quarter-century of Lego Star Wars collaboration. The stand keeps your completed model stable and secure, while showing it off at an eye-catching tilt.</p>



<p>This Millennium Falcon belongs to LEGO’s Starship Collection, a curated series of mid-scale vehicles from across the Star Wars timeline. The scale hits a sweet spot between the massive Ultimate Collector Series models that demand entire shelves and the smaller sets that lack display presence. <strong>At 9.5 inches long, 7.5 inches wide, and 5 inches high</strong>, this Falcon commands attention without dominating your available space.</p>



<p>The build itself is what LEGO refers to as a mindful creative experience designed for adults. Each bag of pieces corresponds to a specific section of the ship, allowing you to tackle the project in manageable sessions after work or on weekends. The instruction manual will walk you through techniques that interlock bricks in satisfying ways, and to watch the Falcon take shape piece by piece delivers that therapeutic flow state that builders chase.</p>
<p>Being a 25th Anniversary edition, this set celebrates the partnership that started in 1999 between Lego and <em>Lucasfilm</em>, which revolutionized both brands. This special commemorative brick is included for display, making your model part of the limited celebration. Anniversary editions are highly regarded by collectors as a milestone in the timeline of Lego and represent both the enduring popularity of the franchise and a specific moment in collecting history.</p>
<p>At $67 for 921 pieces, you’re paying roughly <strong>seven cents per brick</strong> which is well below the typical ten-cent average for licensed Lego sets. The all-time low price turns an already reasonable set into an exceptional value.
