              <p>Apple’s Mac Mini is a small powerhouse of performance but it starts at $599 for the base model, which makes it inaccessible to budget-conscious buyers who only need a dependable desktop computer. If your needs are centered around web browsing, document work, streaming and basic productivity tasks, you really don’t need premium engineering from Apple.</p>
<p>A strong value alternative is the <em>Acemagic Mini PC 11 Pro</em> (16GB DDR4 256GB SSD, Intel N95) which comes in at about one-third of the cost,<a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5318/"> falling from $239 down to $189 on Amazon, with another 10% off coupon that drops your out-the-door price even further</a>. This Windows 11 Pro machine won’t match the Mac Mini’s raw performance but it provides enough power for everyday computing.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5318/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Compact Design That Disappears into Your Setup</h2>
<p>It measures <strong>just 3.9 inches square and 1.3 inches tall</strong>&nbsp;so it’s smaller than most hardcover books and easy to tuck behind monitors, on cramped desks, or in entertainment centers. An included VESA mounting bracket lets you attach this mini PC to the back of your monitor, essentially turning any display into an all-in-one computer setup that will save desk space and eliminate cable clutter. Also, a 2,300 RPM high-speed silent axial fan<strong> keeps the processor cool without generating the annoying whirring noise</strong> that makes cheaper compact PCs sound like miniature jet engines during intensive tasks.</p>



<p>The processor under the hood is an<strong> Intel Alder Lake N95 and clocks up to 3.4GHz on its four cores and four threads</strong> for 45% better performance compared to the N100 and N150 chips found in other budget mini PCs. It’s a quad-core setup that easily handles multiple opened browser tabs, Office applications, and video streaming without the stuttering and lag that makes you want to throw budget computers out the window.</p>
<p>Memory and storage strike a great balance for general computing needs: The 16GB of DDR4 RAM keeps multiple applications running smoothly without slow downs when rapidly switching between programs, checking email, streaming music, and working on documents all at once. The <strong>256GB SSD loads Windows and applications in mere seconds</strong> rather than the painful minutes you’d be stuck with on traditional hard drives and can be easily upgraded to a larger M.2 NVMe or SATA SSD up to 2TB if you need space for photos, videos, or games.</p>



<p><strong>Support for two 4K displays via HDMI 2.0 and DisplayPort 1.4</strong> lets you connect two monitors for expanded workspace to transform your productivity by letting you view reference materials on one screen while you work on the other. The integrated UHD Graphics runs at up to 1.2GHz to handle everyday visuals and 4K video playback with ease.</p>
<p>Connectivity options include everything from modern to legacy: <strong>two USB 3.2 Gen2 ports</strong> for fast data transfer, <strong>two USB 2.0 ports</strong> that can be used for keyboards and mice, and even a<strong> Gigabit Ethernet port</strong> that can reach speeds of as much as 1000Mbps for stable wired internet connectivity. The 3.5mm audio jack supports virtually any set of headphones or external speakers, and the power button is placed in an easily accessible location, not hidden where one has to fumble around blindly.</p>
<p>In the package<strong>, you’ll get Windows 11 Pro</strong>&nbsp;which includes business features like BitLocker encryption, Remote Desktop, and domain joining, among many others, that the home versions don’t have. The hardware is supported with a one-year limited warranty against defects in design and workmanship and support from the Acemagic team if you hit a problem.</p>
<p>For less than $190, thanks to the coupon, this is a workable Windows desktop that will handle everyday computing tasks without breaking the bank.</p>

              <p>Most people can’t justify spending over $3,000 on a laptop, even if they desperately need a bigger screen for spreadsheets, video calls and multitasking across multiple windows. These premium business machines usually stay out of reach, reserved for corporate budgets and lucky pros with generous tech allowances.</p>
<p>Amazon just <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5317/">changed the game by slashing this HP 17-inch powerhouse from $3,599 down to $1,029</a>, delivering a 71% discount that feels like Christmas arrived months early. This deal moves a laptop packed with <strong>64GB of RAM and a 2TB SSD</strong> into territory where most people can actually afford it without maxing out credit cards.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5317/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>A Desktop Replacement That Fits Your Budget</h2>
<p>The <strong>AMD Ryzen 5 7430U processor</strong> in this machine cranks up to 4.3GHz across six cores, giving you enough processing muscle to handle demanding spreadsheets, multiple browser tabs, and video streaming all at the same time. Those six cores split workloads intelligently, dedicating processing power where you need it most while managing background tasks efficiently. <strong>Integrated Radeon Graphics</strong> handle everything from PowerPoint presentations to casual gaming and video editing without the need for a dedicated graphics card, which would ramp up the price further.</p>



<p>The <strong>17.3-inch HD+ touchscreen boasts 1600×900 resolution</strong> for significantly more workspace than you’d get from the standard 15-inch laptops that make you constantly switch between windows. This additional screen real estate revolutionizes the way you’re working with documents and spreadsheets, letting you see two pages side by side or keep reference materials visible while you draft emails.</p>
<p>An anti-glare coating reduces eye strain while working long hours under office lights or near windows, and touch functionality lets you navigate with natural gestures like pinching to zoom and swiping between apps. You can tap your way through presentations during meetings or scroll through research papers with your finger, and interactions will feel more intuitive than reaching for a trackpad all the time.</p>



<p>The webcam of the HP True Vision 720p camera has a physical privacy shutter that slides shut when one wants guaranteed off-camera status without paranoia about whether video software actually went off. <strong>AI Noise Reduction filters background chatter in coffee shops</strong>, keyboard typing sounds, and ambient noise that normally ruins video calls to make your voice clear and professional.</p>
<p>HP Fast Charge technology pushes the <strong>battery to 50% capacity in about 45 minutes</strong>, which means a quick charging session between classes or meetings gives you hours of untethered productivity. Under optimum conditions, the battery delivers upwards of nine hours of video playback to cover a full workday of up to long study sessions without hunting for outlets. A <strong>dedicated Copilot key launches Microsoft’s AI assistant</strong> instantaneously for drafting emails, summarizing documents, and generating quick answers to research questions. <strong>Windows 11 Pro</strong> adds in some enterprise features not found in the home edition, such as BitLocker encryption and Remote Desktop, and advanced security tools to safeguard sensitive work files.</p>
<p>For $1,029, you’re getting specifications that would normally see you paying upwards of triple the asking price.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/apples-official-partner-selling-off-24000mah-power-bank-now-going-for-mere-pennies-2000640848</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/apple%E2%80%99s-official-partner-selling-off-24-000mah-power-bank-now-going-for-mere-pennies.1342780/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Keeping your devices charged on the go shouldn’t be a hassle. If you’re done stuffing your bag with a bunch of chargers or constantly hunting for an outlet when you’re out and about, it’s probably time to get a solid power bank; one that won’t quit on you halfway through the day. Thankfully, we just spotted a solid option going for less on Amazon.</p>
<p>The 24,000mAh, 3-port Anker <em>737</em> power bank<a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4200/"> is down to $74 currently, down from $110</a>. That’s 32% off a high-capacity option but the discount might end soon.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4200/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Ultra-Fast Charging for All Your Essentials</h2>
<p>The Anker 737 comes with a 24,000mAh capacity, which is enough to charge an iPhone 16 Pro over four times, or give a 13-inch iPad Pro (2024 model) more than a full recharge. The 140W max fast charging delivers serious speed. You can charge a 16-inch MacBook Pro or M3 MacBook Air to 50% in just 33 minutes. The iPhone 16 Pro and Samsung Galaxy S23 take only 26 minutes to hit the same mark. This is possible through Power Delivery 3.1, but you’ll want to pair it with a 5A USB-C cable and a 140W adapter to hit full speed.</p>
<p>You’re getting three ports to charge multiple devices at once. These include two USB-C and one USB-A port. There’s also a smart digital display on the front that keeps you in the loop about output and input power and estimated recharge time.</p>



<p>The power bank itself recharges quickly, too. When you’re using a compatible 140W charger, you can go from empty to full in just under an hour. In comparison, most portable chargers in this capacity class take around 7 hours to do the same.</p>
<p>Compatibility is just as impressive. It plays nicely with the latest iPhones, Samsung Galaxy phones, Google Pixel series, MacBooks, iPads, several Windows laptops, plus your accessories like smartwatches and earbuds. It’s also quite lightweight to carry around, so you can take it with you on the go without bulking things up.</p>
<p>In short, if you’ve been looking for a compact charging solution that can power all your essentials up in no time, this power bank/portable charger is a great option to consider. Now is a good time to grab it for less with this Amazon deal.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/ipads-meet-real-competition-amazons-fire-max-11-now-selling-for-pennies-2000640865</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/ipads-meet-real-competition-amazon%E2%80%99s-fire-max-11-now-selling-for-pennies.1342759/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Tablets are great for some on-the-go entertainment and light productivity. You can stream your favorite shows, stay connected with friends, and even meet a few deadlines without carrying your laptop or squinting at a small phone screen.</p>
<p>If you’ve been on the lookout for a reliable option with a bright screen, sleek design, and useful features, we recommend checking the Amazon Fire Max 11 tablet out, especially now that it’s going at a discount on Amazon. The retailer is <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4376/">currently offering it for $189, which is a 32% discount on the retail price of $279</a>. This version <strong>does not include lockscreen ads</strong> so you can enjoy a distraction-free, clean experience.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4376/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Bright Visuals, Ultra-Sleek Design</h2>
<p>The tablet flaunts a thin, sleek frame with a massive 11-inch screen. The display gets you a 2000 x 1200 resolution with over 2.4 million pixels, so you can expect bright, clear visuals that make every detail on the screen pop. Colors appear lifelike, with bright highlights and shadows coming through clearly. The tablet is 3 times as durable as the 10th-gen iPad, so while it’s thin, it’s also sturdy enough for everyday use.</p>
<p>Amazon Fire Max 11 runs on a fast octa-core processor and features a modest 4GB of RAM, which keeps things moving smoothly. It’s not massive, but it still does a decent job of handling regular tasks like browsing, streaming, and light work without slowing down. Storage-wise, you’re covered with a 128GB capacity. It’s more than enough to house a ton of media content and programs, but you also have the option to expand it up to 1TB with a microSD card.</p>
<p>Battery life stretches up to 14 hours, meaning you can go at least a couple of days without worrying about plugging it in. There’s also an 8 MP camera for clearer video calls with friends and family.</p>
<p>You’re even getting 3 months of Microsoft 365 Personal thrown in for free with your purchase, which gets you access to several productivity apps. If you’re planning to use the tablet for work or creative tasks, you can also consider adding Amazon’s keyboard case and Made for Amazon stylus pen for a complete setup. Just note that the discount might expire soon. It’s best to get your orders in sooner rather than later.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/apple-has-dropped-its-11-inch-ipad-a-new-record-low-practically-giving-it-away-2000640860</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Black Friday and Cyber Monday are still a few weeks out, but some of the year’s best tech deals are already rolling in. That makes now a great time to grab Apple gear, especially since the brand rarely offers direct discounts. And if you’ve had your eye on a new iPad, now might be the time to act.</p>
<p>Currently, the 11-inch WiFi Apple iPad with the superfast <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4533/">A16 chip ans 128GB storage is sitting at $299 on Amazon, which is 14% off its regular $349 price</a>. Even better, all color options are discounted, so whether you’re looking for a basic silver or want something with a pop of color, you’ve got options. The only catch? There’s no telling how long the discount or the stock will last, so we recommend acting fast if you want to lock it in.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4533/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Stunning Visuals, Impressive Performance</h2>
<p>You’re getting an 11-inch Liquid Retina display that supports a 2360 x 1640 resolution for stunning visuals. True Tone automatically adjusts the display according to the color temperature of your room, so you won’t have to manually tweak brightness or other settings to stay comfortable.</p>
<p>The device runs on iPadOS and is powered by Apple’s A16 chip that ensures speedy, snappy performance, even when you’re hopping between multiple apps at once. This version comes with 128GB of storage, which is more than enough to house all your important data in one place. 128GB is the sweet spot for most users, but if it feels limited, you can upgrade to models with up to 512GB of storage. Though, of course, those come with a higher price tag.</p>



<p>There’s a 12MP front camera for clear video calls, plus a 12MP rear camera to snap photos. The front camera features Center Stage, so you stay the center of attention on calls, not your couch in the background. Connectivity is made easy with Wi-Fi 6 built in, and the all-day battery life helps you get through your busiest days without stressing about running out of charge.</p>
<p>If you’re looking for a full work or creative setup on the go, you can always add Apple’s Magic Keyboard Folio and USB-C Apple Pencil, both of which are sold separately. For $299, you’re getting solid value packed in a slim, sleek build. If an iPad has been on your wishlist, this might be your best chance to grab it before the holiday rush hits.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/new-fan-made-courage-the-cowardly-dog-game-perfect-creepy-dreams-ps4-2000640924</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Despite being a beloved, award-winning, and popular cartoon,<em> Courage the Cowardly Dog</em> never got an official video game adaptation. And since the show has been out of production for over 23 years now, it’s unlikely to ever get one at this point. But don’t worry, one fan is working hard on making the <em>Courage</em> game you’ve always wanted, and it’s close to launching. You’ll just need a copy of <em>Dreams</em> to play it.</p> <p>Here’s the latest trailer for <a spellcheck="false" href="https://www.youtube.com/@elgatodeltejado">El Gato Del Tejado’s</a> upcoming <em>Courage the Cowardly Dog</em> game, which reveals that the full game will finally be available on November 28, following a previously released demo and <a href="https://youtu.be/0CyY0HVccjY">nearly two years of development</a>. I think the trailer perfectly captures the creepy and surreal vibes of the original Cartoon Network show, complete with Courage screaming and monsters trying to kill him and his owners.</p>

  <p>The weird part about El Gato Del Tejado’s upcoming fan game is that it’s not being developed in Unreal or Unity, as you might expect. Instead, the creator (who is also <a href="https://youtu.be/2HiRJrvvp58">remastering <em>The</em> <em>Simpsons Hit &amp; Run</em></a> and working on other cool projects) has chosen to use <em>Dreams</em> to build this creepy <em>Courage</em> game.</p>

 <p>Remember <em>Dreams</em>? It was the next creative game from <em>LittleBigPlanet</em> studio Media Molecule and offered players a full suite of tools to create and share their own games. Sadly, <a href="https://kotaku.com/the-ps4s-spectacular-dreams-game-is-hurting-from-a-lack-1845925922">the game’s community dried up</a> after it became clear that <em>Dreams</em> would never be supported on PC or <a href="https://kotaku.com/dreams-ps4-ps5-media-molecule-last-update-date-1850323245">get the long-term care it needed</a>. But that hasn’t stopped El Gato from devoting the last few years to becoming a truly skilled <em>Dreams</em> developer. And the <em>Courage</em> game really shows this off. I think if you showed that trailer above to most people, they’d not guess it was made in <em>Dreams</em>.</p> <p>Regardless of how it was made, I’ll be checking it out later this month when it launches on PS4/PS5 via <em>Dreams</em>. I just need to uh…download <em>Dreams</em> again.</p>

              <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/arc-raiders-pvpve-extraction-maps-embark-studios-2000639945"><i>Arc Raiders</i></a>, the new PvPvE extraction shooter from <i>The Finals </i>dev Embark Studios, arrived last week. And after a wildly successful weekend with more than 300,000 concurrent players on Steam alone, the clips and anecdotes of the most epic, hilarious, and absurd situations out there are pouring in.</p> <p><b>Read More:</b> <a href="https://kotaku.com/arc-raiders-gifts-premium-currency-after-server-struggles-2000640888"><i>Arc Raiders</i> Players Are Getting Free Tokens But Frustrations Over Pricey Cosmetics Remain</a></p> <p>As an extraction shooter in which players must contend with threats from enemy AI as well as other players following their own agendas, <i>Arc Raiders</i> is primed to generate loads of&nbsp; unexpected emergent situations. It feels trite to say “you never know what’s going to happen” in a match of <i>Arc Raiders</i>, but after about 50 hours with the game, it feels very true. But don’t just take my word for it; have a gander at some of these wild moments from <i>Arc Raiders</i>’ first weekend.</p>

 <p><b>Read More:</b> <a href="https://kotaku.com/arc-raiders-embark-extraction-virgil-watkins-interview-2000639879">I Asked <i>Arc Raiders</i>’ Design Director If Camping Makes Me A Bad Person</a></p> <p>If you’ve been on the fence when it comes to jumping into <i>Arc Raiders</i>, behold everything you’re missing:</p>

 <h2>Who knew there’d be this much parkour in <i>Arc Raiders</i>?</h2> <p>While you may not feel very fast or mobile at first in <i>Arc Raiders</i>, investing in your “Mobility” skill tree dramatically improves how long you can run and how much of your stamina you hold onto while performing dodges, jumps and vaults. <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ArcRaiders/comments/1omuulj/parkour_raiders/">Here’s one such example</a>:</p>

   <p>What’s all that jumping good for, I hear you ask? Well, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ArcRaiders/comments/1ol51b6/this_was_accidental_i_didnt_know_you_could_do_that/">hop on top of an Arc drone</a> and find out, as in this example here:</p>   <p>Or check out this “blink-and-you’ll-miss-it” moment (it happens right at the very end) in which a player <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ArcRaiders/comments/1omjdyx/my_friend_jumped_on_a_hornet_and_crashed_it_into/">rides a drone straight into another one</a>, destroying both of them. Action movie shit right here.</p>

   <p>In what may very likely end up being a technique that gets patched out of existence, a few clips are showing off how you can leap from a great height, grab onto a ledge as you’re plummeting, and completely cancel out the fall damage. Here’s an example of it being used for what is certainly <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ArcRaiders/comments/1ok1l69/first_game_and_i_extracted_like_a_true_stealthy/">a Solid Snake-approved stealthy escape</a>:</p>

    <p>Or, seemingly, you can just use the technique to <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ArcRaiders/comments/1ompomw/has_anyone_survived_a_tower_freefall_like_this/">leap off of the damn tower in Spaceport</a>:</p>

    <p>Even if you’ve figured out how to mitigate fall damage without resorting to any questionable shenanigans, you still need to <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ArcRaiders/comments/1ol60ci/you_wanna_see_something_sick/">keep an eye out for Arc</a>s that go Pop:</p>    <p>And this kind of stuff is only getting started, as one player shows off some of the sick moves you can pull off once you start finding the game’s more elite gear, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ArcRaiders/comments/1omyx97/snaphook_makes_for_some_crazy_plays_i_cant/">such as the Snaphook</a>:</p>   <h2>Strange player encounters and sudden but inevitable betrayals</h2> <p>If you’ve played a decent amount of <i>Arc Raiders</i>, you’ve certainly experienced the strange prisoner’s-dilemma social experiments that emerge from players trying to determine who they can trust–and when might be the best moment for betrayal.</p>

 <p>One player who just wanted to get out decided they weren’t going to risk it, and so held up another player at gunpoint, refusing to lower their weapon until the extraction train was ready to go. <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@arcraiders/video/7568568614408736030/">Behold this exchange</a>:</p>    <p>Proximity chat has been one of the standout features in this regard, allowing players who aren’t partied up to coordinate, which is what this player did to betray <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ArcRaiders/comments/1on3on7/betrayed_my_two_racist_extraction_camping/">some toxic extraction campers</a> (language warning on this one):</p>

    <p>Here’s another story of a player using prox chat to <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ArcRaiders/comments/1olu7qw/most_evil_shit_ive_done_ingame_so_far/">betray their non-cooperative teammates</a>. It’s like a synopsis of a <i>Walking Dead</i> episode:</p>    <p>Meanwhile, another player reflects on their decision to kill someone who was only <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ArcRaiders/comments/1omfe9q/i_murdered_a_gardener_and_i_feel_aweful/">armed with…fruit?</a></p>   <p>And on Discord, an <i>Arc Raiders</i>’ player reveals they were tricked into believing another player was Embark Studios staff testing out a closed-off area of the map. <a href="https://x.com/ARCBulletn/status/1985158879203017074">The post reads</a>:</p>

 <blockquote><p>Was scammed by a Raider earlier how do I report?</p> <p>A guy at the research building on the Dam map was sitting behind the desk when I waked out. Said he was a game mod for Embark Studios and that part of the map was closed off due to development testing and that any loot I had was already considered exploited gear because I got it during a testing phase.</p> <p>Made me strip all my loot for him to inspect it. Told me that indeed it was exploited as he expected then told me to get lost or he would be forced to ban me.</p> <p>I hid outside and followed him to an elevator and watched him leave with my gear. This type of behavior needs to end.</p></blockquote> <p>As someone who convinced many people in <i>Halo 3</i> to do weird stuff in non-ranked games under the pretense that it would earn them a special helmet, no, this behavior doesn’t need to end.</p> <p>Not all encounters between players have been of this…toxic-adjacent variety. In <i>Arc Raiders</i>, you can find recorders (those plastic flute things that kids often learn music with) and can <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ArcRaiders/comments/1oktwhj/dude_wth_lmao/">play them for other players</a>. And it’s <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ArcRaiders/comments/1ona1lb/we_stumbled_upon_a_random_flute_player_ontop_of/">creating some odd situations</a>:</p>      <p>Some other players are embracing their musical side by, well, singing. Prepare for one of the more disturbing renditions of “Do You Know the Muffin Man?” ever created. This is perhaps <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ArcRaiders/comments/1on5gn4/no_one_told_me_arc_raiders_is_a_horror_game/">my favorite clip out of everything here</a>:</p>    <p>But it’s not all silliness and toxic behavior. Check out this <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ArcRaiders/comments/1okra8b/absolute_cinema/">awesome moment involving quite an unexpected turn of events</a>:</p>

    <p>Here’s a <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ArcRaiders/comments/1omx2kb/is_this_the_biggest_team_up_yet/">large group of rando Raiders teaming up</a> to take on our universal enemy: Arc.</p>    <h2>Arc shenanigans and other explosive moments</h2> <p><i>Arc Raiders</i> gives you a lot of liberty to toy with its robotic enemies, as well as its arsenal of lethal equipment. In case you need a refresher of the kinds of threats out there, let’s reflect on yet another <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ArcRaiders/comments/1ols9ti/til_the_leaper_gets_its_name_for_a_reason/">Leaper showing off what it does best</a>:</p>

    <p>But it turns out that crazy jumping ability of the Leaper <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ArcRaiders/comments/1omk2s6/paid_actor_leaper/">can come in handy</a>:</p>    <p>Behold another player taking on a Leaper with…<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ArcRaiders/comments/1omldku/i_killed_a_leaper_with_one_bullet_and_a_pile_of_7/"><i>seven</i> explosive Wasp drivers</a>:</p>    <p>Okay, enough killing robots. Here’s <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ArcRaiders/comments/1on8olk/my_lucky_grenade/">a single grenade taking out <i>multiple</i> enemy players</a> in a shower of fireworks.</p>    <p>It’s still early days for <i>Arc Raiders</i>, and as better loot gets discovered and is distributed amongst the community, I fully expect to see even more crazy shit in the weeks ahead. Stay safe out there, ya’ll. And keep recording; this game is a gold mine of potential.</p>
