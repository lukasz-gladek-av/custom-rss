Props to the studio for acknowledging the game’s popularity and trying to curb some of this kind of behavior. The full list of guidelines is as follows:</p><ol data-type="List" data-style="Number"><li>Contact the Kyousoba Furusato Information Center to discover if visits are possible.</li><li>Contact the Kyousoba Furusato Information Center for details on the times of visits.</li><li>Follow the instructions provided by the staff working at the stables.</li><li>Do not enter stable buildings or grazing land without permission.</li><li>Do not shout or make loud noises.</li><li>Never touch the horses.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>I did a double-take. <em>Red Sonja</em>?! Like, <em>that Red Sonja</em>? The character from the Arnie film I watched far too many times with my friends as a teenager, and then quoted from for the rest of my silly little life? “I’m luuuking fah Reeed Saaaarrrrrnyah!” Yup. It’s that one. Except, in what looks like quite a twist since the 1985 film, the new trailer suggests this one might actually be <em>about</em> Red Sonja.</p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="197586" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="Disney+ Pulls The Abyss Over Controversial Rat Scene — Again" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="128" data-playlist="197586,196406,197589" data-current="197586"><div><p>Disney+ Pulls The Abyss Over Controversial Rat Scene — Again</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197586/197586_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197586/197586_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197586/197586_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/23107.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>Movies go through all sorts of strange phases—strings of cartoons about sentient fish, for instance—but resurrecting classic Arnold Schwarzenegger movies from the 1980s, but without Arnold Schwarzenegger, is one of the weirdest.</p><p> First we have (the truly soulless-looking) <em>The Running Man</em> coming from Edgar Wright later this year, which <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KD18ddeFuyM&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KD18ddeFuyM" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">recently released a trailer</a></span> showing the empty frame of Glen Powell blandly running and ducking while the direction declared “THIS IS EXTREMELY FUNNY,” and yet at no point was there the appearance of <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://youtu.be/2SPgPBSrFZ0?si=TZ5M9tJ9gVNA7gge&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://youtu.be/2SPgPBSrFZ0?si=TZ5M9tJ9gVNA7gge" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">a man dressed as a Christmas tree</a></span>. And now we have <em>Red Sonja</em>? It was weird enough in 2012 when the never-climactic Len Wiseman (<em>Underworld</em>, <em>Ballerina</em>) thought it a good idea to try to remake perfect cinematic classic <em>Total Recall</em>, with a stunningly miscast Colin Farrell playing Douglas Quaaaaaiiiiid.</p><figure id="" data-id="6da195fce6cf753fff6972cc139745dd" data-recommend-id="image://6da195fce6cf753fff6972cc139745dd" data-format="jpg" data-width="1707" data-height="960" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Sonja looks up after plunging a dagger into an enemy." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Sonja looks up after plunging a dagger into an enemy." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Millennium Films / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="6da195fce6cf753fff6972cc139745dd" data-recommend-id="image://6da195fce6cf753fff6972cc139745dd" data-format="jpg" data-width="1707" data-height="960" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Sonja looks up after plunging a dagger into an enemy." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Unlike <em>The Running Man</em>, which has a big-name director and main star, <em>Red Sonja</em>’s 2025 revision is perhaps a little more low-key. It’s directed by M. J. Bassett, who has a healthy credit sheet when it comes to directing solid television shows (including four episodes of the wonderful <em>Ash Vs Evil Dead</em>), but she perhaps has a slightly less impressive record on the big screen. Remember 2020's Megan Fox vehicle <em>Rogue</em>? No? How about 2021's <em>Endangered Species</em>, starring Rebecca Romijn and Jerry O’Connell? That slipped by you too? But even critics didn’t see those films, so what about a movie that did get reviewed? 2012's <em>Silent Hill: Revelation 3D</em>? That had Malcolm McDowell, Sean Bean, Carrie-Anne Moss and Kit Harrington! And <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.metacritic.com/movie/silent-hill-revelation-3d/critic-reviews/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.metacritic.com/movie/silent-hill-revelation-3d/critic-reviews/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">a Metascore of 16</a></span>. Ouch.</p><p>It’s not exactly an all-star cast, either. Sonja herself is played by Matilda Lutz (<em>Rings</em>, <em>Magpie</em>), and the only other names I recognize are Trevor Eve and Rhona Mitra, and that’s because I’m British. Meanwhile, Arnie’s character from Richard Fleischer’s 1985 movie, Kalidor, doesn’t appear to be in the film at all!</p><p>You know what, that’s probably a good thing. As hilariously dreadful as Arnie was in absolutely everything, seeing someone else trying to reprise one of his roles is always so awkward. It was very much his scenery-chewing, bicep-popping, terrible-acting ways that made him so completely charming, and everyone else just seems like a cardboard cutout when stood in his shoes. And, rather crucially, a film about Red Sonja really ought to have been about Red Sonja, but even as early as then, Arnie’s star power made him the focus throughout. Things look very different this time out.</p><p>And yes, sure, it looks like absolute gibberish, but I’m totally here for it. There is perhaps rather a lot of “BUT SHE’S DOING IT EVEN THOUGH SHE’S A GIRL!” energy throughout the trailer, but that’s still better than Brigitte Nielsen fighting to ever actually appear on screen as the main character. </p><p>The source material was written by Robert E. Howard, he of <em>Conan the Barbarian</em> fame, and while he was a giant old racist, he was also an advocate of presenting powerful female characters. That leaves me hopeful that under M. J. Bassett’s helm, we can at least see Sonja be a more significant brute.</p><p>Oh, and let’s not forget that Fleischer’s version was absolutely bloody awful! He may have given us <em>Soylent Green</em> (1973) and <em>Fantastic Voyage</em> (1966), but they couldn’t all be bangers. It was deservedly mauled on release, with Gene Siskel handing it a single star in the <em>Chicago Tribune</em>. But try telling that to teenage me, watching it with mates, swigging from painfully cheap two-liter plastic bottles of cider.</p><p>The new movie doesn’t have a release date yet, beyond being some time this year.</p><p>.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://kotaku.com/red-sonja-arnold-schwarzenegger-bassett-movie-trailer-1851786097]]></content:encoded>

I mean, that’s interesting enough right there. What makes it even more fascinating is that this game which requires a group of people to be together is exploring loneliness. Each person takes on a person who might appear in the painting, deciding among yourselves what kind of place this diner is, what sorts of relationships you might have between you. The GM-free game leaves players exploring the topic of loneliness together, choosing whether they might succumb or battle against it. It sounds incredible.</p><figure id="" data-id="868ead78603ff72ad62d4f9870d51ba2" data-recommend-id="image://868ead78603ff72ad62d4f9870d51ba2" data-format="jpg" data-width="1070" data-height="279" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The Helan logo." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="The Helan logo." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Pinayu</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="868ead78603ff72ad62d4f9870d51ba2" data-recommend-id="image://868ead78603ff72ad62d4f9870d51ba2" data-format="jpg" data-width="1070" data-height="279" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The Helan logo." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Solo TTPRGs are an aspect of the genre that I constantly forget can be a thing. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://pinayu.itch.io/helan&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://pinayu.itch.io/helan" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em><strong>Helan</strong></em></a></span> is one such example, where you play as a person who spends their life accompanying those who visit the white sands of Helan in order to help them reach their destinations. It’s a road trip, one about relationships with strangers, and a world-building game where the conversations you choose define the world around you. Oh, and you have a hoverbike. The game comes with print-outs of a 16-page booklet that tells you how to play, and all the information you need, along with a two-page guide filled with 108 travelers you can accompany as you play.</p><p>God there are so many games about being a dad. But there are so damn few about being a mom. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://floaker.itch.io/mum-chums&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://floaker.itch.io/mum-chums" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong><em>Mum Chums</em></strong></a></span>, however, is “a slice of life RPG about people who care for kids.” You don’t have to be a mom—any adult carer can be portrayed—but the game states it’s specifically written from a “white Scottish perspective.” The game begins when your kids are about to start school, with no winning or losing, but rather roleplaying a specific part of life. The game is still in development, but fully playable.</p><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://floaker.itch.io/be-seeing-you&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://floaker.itch.io/be-seeing-you" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong><em>Be Seeing You</em></strong></a></span> is a 3-5 player (or “prisoner”) game about our dystopian surveillance culture. There’s no GM and no dice, but rather a <em>Prisoner</em>-inspired exploration of the infiltrating nature of capitalism. Outside of this bundle, you can buy the game for $13, or just download it for free because “Digital media should be freely available.” Developer Tanya Floaker then encourages people to upload and share the files with others as much as they wish.</p><h2 id="h90275"><a id=""></a>Where is the money going?</h2><p>The money raised is being split between two charities working with U.S. immigrants affected by the brutal and despicable actions of ICE. The first is the <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.immdef.org/support&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.immdef.org/support" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>Immigrant Defenders Law Center</strong></a></span>, a law firm created in 2015 by immigration lawyers, looking to defend people faced with deportation, but also to bring about systemic change to the grim system. Of course, the people ImmDef works with are rarely in a position to be able to pay for legal representation, so this non-profit provides always-free services and is sustained by donations. They also <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.immdef.org/shop&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.immdef.org/shop" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">have merch</a></span>!</p><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://raicestexas.org/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://raicestexas.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>RAICES</strong></a></span> also offers legal services for families looking to make the U.S. their home. It provides a broad range of services, either free or low-cost, in many parts of Texas, and again is reliant on donations to continue its work. And why a Texan organization given the Californian nature of this bundle? That’s because a lot of the people ICE targets in LA are then forcibly taken to Texas.</p><p>So, you know, even if you pay the $10 (or as much as you want to give) and then forget you ever did, you’ve made an important difference. But you’ve also got an enormous trove of games and table-top RPGs to explore for months to come.</p><p>.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://kotaku.com/itch-io-bundle-no-ice-in-california-table-top-rpg-1851786085]]></content:encoded>
