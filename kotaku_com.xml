              <p>Shoot ’em ups were one of the first video game sensations to sweep through arcades. The novelist Martin Amis became so obsessed with 1978’s <em>Space Invaders</em> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/games/2018/nov/05/martin-amis-invasion-of-the-space-invaders-1982-gaming-book-republished">he wrote an entire guide/appreciation of sorts for it</a> long before the idea of games criticism was considered anything worth thinking about. From fixed-screen shooters like <em>Galaxian</em> and <em>Galaga</em> were born side-scrolling shooters like <em>Defender</em> and vertical scrollers like <em>Xevious</em>. Modern shooters prioritize precision aiming but old-school shoot ’em ups are all about precision positioning. The result is a series of spatial awareness puzzles infused with the nail-biting tension of futuristic guns, close calls, and endless carnage.</p> <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/gradius-iii-was-fun-and-hard-as-bullet-hell-1840017080">When Konami’s <em>Gradius</em> arrived in 1985</a> it quickly became one of the cornerstones of the genre thanks to its novel upgrade system, catchy music, and memorable boss fights. While its success, especially in the West, was short-lived, its cult status, which includes admiration for its unflinching difficulty, lives on. The road from <em>Space Invaders</em> to<em> Doom</em> to <em>Call of Duty</em> runs through <em>Gradius</em>. It’s an important legacy that’s now been admirably preserved thanks to the excellent <em>Gradius Origins</em> collection.</p> <p><iframe loading="lazy" title="GRADIUS ORIGINS Launch Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="about:blank" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen="" data-rocket-lazyload="fitvidscompatible" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/yA3UFCx8nqQ?feature=oembed"></iframe></p> <p>Out August 7 on PlayStation, Xbox, Switch, and PC, Konami’s tribute to its shmup history was developed by emulation experts M2 and contains <em>Gradius</em>, <em>Gradius II</em>, <em>Gradius III</em>, <em>Life Force</em>, <em>Salamander</em>, <em>Salamander 2</em>, and <em>Salamander 3</em>, an entirely new game in that lineage that satisfyingly recreates the old magic with new levels (M2 was also responsible for 2007’s franchise reimagining, <em>Gradius ReBirth</em>). It’s hard not to notice what’s missing.<em> Gradius</em> <em>Gaiden</em>, <em>Gradius IV</em>, <em>Gradius V</em>, and more are all MIA. Perhaps Konami is holding out for a second collection. At $40, <em>Gradius Origins</em> isn’t cheap, but what’s there is a polished and fulsome assembly of the past that doesn’t cut corners.</p>

 <p>You can consult <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2mBaTEjmVE">Digital Foundry’s fantastic breakdown</a> for more on the series’ history and M2’s emulation in this collection. The games are tough as nails, especially for anyone unfamiliar with the unforgiving grind of quarter-based gameplay. Thankfully, the new collection includes modern aids like gameplay rewinding and quick-save reloads. Crisp presentation and quality-of-life additions are only half the story, though.<em> Gradius Origins</em> also includes alternative arcade versions of every game, with helpful documentation explaining what was changed between releases, including updates to make the game easier for American players or to fix high score exploits being taken advantage of in Japan. Console editions are unfortunately missing, but it’s still a really neat window into ’80s arcade gaming history.</p> <p><iframe loading="lazy" title="Earthion | Digital Launch Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="about:blank" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen="" data-rocket-lazyload="fitvidscompatible" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/KBJmYcrMx-4?feature=oembed"></iframe></p> <p>While <em>Gradius Origins</em> is a great, authentic look at the shoot ’em up genre’s past,<em> Earthion</em> brings it forward into the present with a new entry that oozes retro charm. Arriving on PC last week (console versions will be available in September), <em>Earthion</em> is a 16-bit shmup directed by famous<em> Streets of Rage</em> composer Yuzo Koshiro and developed natively for the Sega Genesis/Mega Drive (cartridges won’t be available until next year). All I can say is it’s the real deal: crunchy pixel art, snappy controls, and tight gameplay balanced to be approachable (at least if you’re playing on normal difficulty) with a top-notch soundtrack that keeps you coming back.</p> <p>The art is what stands out most, with gorgeous backgrounds full of parallax scrolling effects that remind you what true “next-gen” upgrades used to feel like back in the ’90s. <em>Earthion</em> is also much more forgiving than its inspirations like <em>Gradius</em> and <em>R-Type</em>. Health bars and shield meters make it much easier to stay alive and snowball your upgrades. It’s a great debut game from Koshiro’s new studio, Ancient Corporation. There are apparently pirated ROMs of it going around, which the composer <a href="https://www.timeextension.com/news/2025/08/please-support-us-pleads-yuzo-koshiro-as-pirated-earthion-rom-appears-online">has begged</a> people to avoid so the group can stick around long enough to make its next game.</p> <p>The back-to-back releases are fitting considering <em>Gradius</em>‘ soundtrack was <a href="https://games.kikizo.com/features/yuzo_koshiro_iv_oct05_p1.asp">one Koshiro has cited</a> as a powerful inspiration for his own work. As a genre, the shmup hasn’t gotten the same classic revival some other retro genres have over the last decade, but taken together, these games are a great start.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              
              <p>When the original <i>Tom Clancy’s Splinter Cell</i> arrived in 2002, it threatened to dethrone <i>Metal Gear Solid</i>’s tight grip on the stealth genre. And for some purists, it likely succeeded, given its groundbreaking technical displays of light and shadow that were more than just pretty to look at. The game also pushed you to move with more caution, with enemies that, in some instances, were far more perceptive than what <i>Metal Gear Solid 2</i> offered at the time. <i>MGS3</i> would arrive shortly after to up its stealth game, perhaps having learned a thing or two from <i>Splinter Cell</i>, but the original <i>SC</i> and its two direct sequels remain incredible challenges for those of us who like to lurk around in the shadows. And if you’ve been craving a return to Sam Fisher’s first outing, then let me tell you about this incredible mod that makes it hard to go back to the original.</p> <p><i>Enhanced SC</i> is a project from modder Joshhhuaaa that you can <a href="https://github.com/Joshhhuaaa/EnhancedSC">grab on GitHub</a> right now for both Windows and Steam Deck. It introduces a suite of improvements, which include a mission statistics tracker that lets you know just how stealthy your current run is, proper widescreen support, fixes to movement speed, better controller support, maps based on original Xbox versions, the Nuclear Power Plant level from the PS2 version, and <a href="https://github.com/Joshhhuaaa/EnhancedSC/blob/main/PatchNotes.md">so much more</a>.</p> <figure id="attachment_2000616402" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000616402"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000616402">© Ubisoft / Joshhhuaaa / Claire Jackson / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p>While many mods of this kind sometimes make for an experience that feels quite different from the original game, <i>Enhanced SC</i> feels remarkably faithful to what it was like to play <i>Splinter Cell</i> on PS2 or Xbox back in the day. There are some notable tweaks to the gameplay, such as the inclusion of whistling (which would show up in later <i>SC</i> games), and distinct commands for opening a door fully or partially to peek into the next room. These feel like very natural inclusions to the original game–in fact, until I read through the patch notes, I didn’t realize they <em>weren’t</em> in the first <i>SC</i>.</p>

 <p>Steam Deck support, however, is where this mod really shines. It runs surprisingly well for such an old game on a Linux machine. There’s also a dedicated “EnhancedSC Layout” controller scheme you can download from the community layouts that allows for precision aiming by way of the right touchpad, and a quicksave and load feature mapped to the left one (this makes quickly resetting to your last save for save-scummy playthroughs a breeze).</p> <figure id="attachment_2000616403" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000616403"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000616403">© Ubisoft / Joshhhuaaa / Claire Jackson / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p>If it’s been a while since you’ve jumped into Sam’s sneaking suit, do yourself a favor and check out this mod. Who knows when (or if) we’re getting <a href="https://kotaku.com/ubisoft-7-canceled-games-splinter-cell-assasin-s-creed-1849976552">that damn remake anyway</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              
              <p>Sony’s massively popular third-person online sci-fi shooter <a href="https://kotaku.com/helldivers-2-xbox-series-x-s-release-date-ps5-exclusive-1851785573"><em>Helldivers 2</em> is coming to Xbox later this month</a>. Many fans had assumed that developers Arrowhead had been the ones behind the decision, likely pushing PlayStation to let them port the game to the company’s rival console. But it turns out it was actually Sony’s idea, and that’s just more evidence that the <a href="https://kotaku.com/console-wars-are-over-ps5-xbox-forza-switch-2-sony-1851752956">console wars are over.</a></p> <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/helldivers-2-kotaku-review-pc-ps5-is-it-good-ps-plus-1851"><em>Helldivers 2</em> launched in early 2024</a> to <a href="https://kotaku.com/helldivers-2-sony-steam-pc-ps5-players-1851268838">rave reviews and huge player counts.</a> And since then, the game has continued to receive frequent updates, growing larger in scale as it adds more enemies and its massive galactic story of war continues to evolve. But for the last year, the only way to play <em>Helldivers 2</em> was on PS5 or PC. This left Xbox players out of the loop. That changes on August 26, when Helldivers lands on Xbox Series X/S with full crossplay support. And according to Arrowhead’s CEO Shams Jorjani, the decision to port <em>Helldivers 2</em> came entirely from PlayStation.</p> <p>On August 6, as reported by <em>Windows Central,</em> when a player praised Arrowhead for bringing the <em>Helldivers</em> sequel to Xbox, Jorjani stepped in and gave Sony all the credit. “It was all PlayStation. Send them your thanks,” posted Jorjani in the game’s official Discord server. “We were all in support, of course.” The Arrowhead CEO later added, “I think it’s one of the coolest things [Sony’s] done. They’re killing it.”</p> <p>While it might at first seem odd that PlayStation would bring one of its most popular video games in years to a rival platform, the reality is that the console wars have mostly fizzled out. Thanks to crossplay, cross save, Xbox ditching the whole affair after losing last gen, and Nintendo doing their own thing, there’s just not much of a war anymore. <a href="https://kotaku.com/xbox-podcast-exclusivity-business-update-ps5-hi-fi-rush-1851261518?_gl=1*q9wu73*_ga*MTg4NjY0MzM1NS4xNzM5NDU1MDcz*_ga_V4QNJTT5L0*czE3NTM3MDQ1NzEkbzEyOSRnMSR0MTc1MzcwOTY4NCRqNjAkbDAkaDA.">Xbox has found great success bringing its hit games like <em>Forza</em> to PlayStation 5</a>, and Sony is following in their footsteps now by bringing games like <em>Marathon</em> and <em>Helldivers 2</em> to Xbox, as well as continuing to port games like <em>Spider-Man</em> to PC. At this point, it just makes more sense to put your games on more platforms. This is especially true for big, expensive live-service games that rely on lots of players actively engaging with the game daily to make money. So I’d expect to see even more Xbox and PlayStation games hopping across platforms in the future. I mean, <a href="https://kotaku.com/gears-of-war-1-reloaded-remaster-ps5-xbox-pc-summer-1851779167"><em>Gears of War</em></a> is coming to PlayStation this year.&nbsp; <a href="https://kotaku.com/ps5-xbox-exclusivity-helldivers-spiderman-switch-2-1851787122">The walls have fallen. The console wars are over. And only Nintendo seems to care about keeping stuff exclusive</a>.</p>
