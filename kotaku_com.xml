While it will allow you to share digital titles with friends and family members, this is still Nintendo we are talking about, so the whole system is a bit weird and complicated. </p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="196181" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="The Best Reveals From The Game Awards 2023" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="180" data-playlist="196181,196230,194644" data-current="196181"><div><p>The Best Reveals From The Game Awards 2023</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196181/196181_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196181/196181_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196181/196181_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196181/196181_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/21718.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>“What if digital games could be as flexible and convenient as game cards?” That’s the question that Nintendo apparently asked itself when coming up with Virtual Game Cards. </p><p> Starting in late April, all digital games you own or buy will become <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://youtu.be/EWwyh74MXXY&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://youtu.be/EWwyh74MXXY" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Virtual Game Cards</a></span>.

Nintendo says any registered user on the console can play that digital game. </p><p>The real news is that these VGCs can be “digitally ejected” and “digitally loaded”  into another Switch console and freely played on that second device. The original Switch user that bought the game can’t play that VGC anymore as it’s been “ejected” from the console. </p><p>The company promises that you are free to load and trade digital games using VGCs freely between two specific, paired systems. Think an upstairs Switch and downstairs Switch 2.  You will need to locally connect the two consoles the first time you do some digital swapping, but after that it should be easy and hassle free. </p><p>You can also share Virtual Game Cards with members of your Nintendo Account Family Group. However, this is a bit more limited. It must be done over a local wireless connection, and you can only lend one game at a time to each member. And after two weeks, they lose access to the Virtual Game Card and it returns back to original owner. Better hope it’s not a long game!</p><p>Nintendo claims this new system will make digital games even easier to use. And this new system will also work with the Nintendo Switch 2, as confirmed by the company during the Direct. But it does seem like a very Nintendo solution to a problem Xbox and others solved already. Still, I’m happy to see Nintendo doing something to make it easier to play owned digital games on multiple devices as we get closer to the launch of Switch 2. </p><p> .<br></p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

She has to fight off local vine-swinging enemies and solve puzzles with a set of psychic powers that let Samus control objects from afar. The new trailer ended with a look at a mysterious alien race Samus will be trying to help on the planet, as well as a new red suit they’ll seemingly unlock for her. </p><p>The footage also shows off the various environments on the planet’s surface and familiar sights like Samus coiling up into a ball and rolling through tiny underground passages. There’s also plenty of bugs, alien plants, and other local fauna to fight. The psychic powers look they’ll be used to help solve a number of tracing puzzles too, which seems like a good fit for the Switch’s touch and gyro controls. </p><p><em>Metroid Prime 4</em> still has no specific release date but Nintendo reaffirmed it’s coming before the end of 2025. With Switch 2 just around the corner, it’s possible it will have an upgraded version on the new console, similar to<em> The</em> <em>Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild </em>in 2017, which was cross-gen between Wii U and the original Switch. </p><p>Either way, <em>Metroid Prime 4 </em>seems likely to be the final hurrah for the current hardware, potentially taking it within spitting distance of its nine-year anniversary. Hopefully we still get HD remasters of <em>Metroid Prime 2</em> and<em> 3</em> on Switch before then. </p><p>.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
