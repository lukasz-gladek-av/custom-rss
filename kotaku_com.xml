              <p>After nearly 20 years of operation, digital video game storefront GOG is no longer a part of <em>Witcher 3 </em>and <em>Cyberpunk 2077</em> developer CD Projekt Red. It is now fully owned by one of CDPR’s co-founders who also helped launch GOG.</p> <p>On December 29, <a href="https://www.gog.com/pressroom/cd-projekt-co-founder-michal-kicinski-acquires-gog-from-cd-projekt/">CDPR announced via a press release</a> that its Steam-like storefront, GOG, has been fully acquired by CDPR co-founder Michał Kiciński. As part of the deal, Kiciński now owns 100 percent of GOG’s shares after purchasing them for 90 million PLN or about 25 million USD. The deal didn’t involve the co-founder selling any of his shares in CDPR.</p> <p>“GOG and Michał Kiciński are aligned by a shared belief that games should live forever,”&nbsp;said GOG managing director Maciej Gołębiewski.&nbsp;“In a market that’s getting more crowded, more locked-in, and forgets classic games at an increasing pace, we’re doubling down on what only GOG does: reviving classics, keeping them playable on modern PCs, and helping great games find their audience over time.”</p>

 <p>Launched in October 2008, GOG (originally known as Good Old Games) was started as a place for retro games to be sold by various publishers and developers. The store offers titles with no DRM and has since expanded greatly, selling new and old games while also <a href="https://kotaku.com/gog-games-preservation-program-drm-1851696363">starting an ambitious preservation program</a> to help keep dated games running on modern hardware without publisher support.</p>

 <p>As to why CDPR is selling GOG now, joint CEO Michał Nowakowski says the company has an “<em>ambitious development roadmap”</em> and plans to expand the studio’s franchises, so it made sense to split GOG off and let CDRP focus on its own projects.</p>

 <p>“For a long time now, GOG has been operating independently. Now it’s going into very good hands — we are convinced that with the support of Michał Kiciński, one of GOG’s co-founders, its future will be full of great projects and successes,<em>“</em> said Nowakowski.</p>

 <p>While CDPR will no longer own GOG, it confirmed plans to continue to release its new games on the digital storefront. So, at least for now, it seems like nothing will be changing for players as GOG goes fully independent.</p>

              <p data-start="0" data-end="546">The trend of most software companies in the last decade has been to switch operations over to a subscription-based model, where you pay monthly for access to the latest features and updates. Microsoft, for example, offers its Office suite through Microsoft 365, which requires an ongoing monthly payment. While this model keeps you up to date with the newest software and app updates, it also means you’re committing to paying for it forever. There’s something much more appealing to just paying for a thing once and then owning it, which is why this Microsoft Office deal is very exciting. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6602/">For a limited time, StackSocial is offering Microsoft Office 2024 Home for both Windows and Mac at a significant discount—up to 40% off.</a></p>
<p data-start="0" data-end="546">The offer includes doesn’t include the full Microsoft Office suite, just the big three. That’s Word, Excel, and PowerPoint. You can get the 2024 versions of this software for just $120 for a limited time. That’s down 20% from $150, saving your $30. If you really need Outlook as well, perhaps operating a small business out of home and are looking for alternatives to Gmail, then you can get the Home &amp; Business bundle which adds on Outlook to the other three. That package is 40% off which brings it from $250 to just $150.</p>

<h2 data-start="548" data-end="585"><strong data-start="548" data-end="585">One-Time Payment, Lifetime Access</strong></h2>
<p data-start="1500" data-end="1745">This is the 2024 suite for Microsoft Office applications. They come with a lot of helpful features unique to 2024 and later versions. PowerPoint for instance now lets user record presentations from within the app. You can record voice, video, and closed captions. This is wonderful for teachers uploading courses for online classes as well as really any business presentation that’d be helpful to be able to reference back to later again and again.</p>


<p data-start="1747" data-end="2244">Once you purchase the software, you can immediately download and install it. After completing your order, you will receive an email with your software license keys and download links. The license is tied to your Microsoft Account—not your actual device—and is a one-time use code. Be sure to redeem your software within seven days of purchase, as all sales are final once the license is activated. Unredeemed licenses can be returned within seven days for a refund.</p>
<p data-start="2246" data-end="2621">If you’re setting up a new laptop or desktop and want to avoid the hassle of monthly fees, this is what you want over Microsoft 365. For just $120, you can get lifetime access to the 2024 versions of Word, Excel, and PowerPoint. You can add in Outlook for just $30 more. The deal is available to both Windows and Mac users.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>If you really liked the recent <em>Silent Hill 2</em> remake and <a href="https://kotaku.com/silent-hill-f-review-horror-konami-hinako-ryukishi07-2000627505">this year’s <em>Silent Hill f</em></a> and are still craving more foggy survival horror, well, I’ve got some good news for you. Konami has no plans to slow down now and wants to release at least one game a year in the series moving forward. Nothing bad ever happens when a franchise becomes annual, right?</p> <p>In a recent interview with <em><a href="https://www.famitsu.com/article/202512/61923">Famitsu</a>,</em> <a href="https://www.gematsu.com/2025/12/japanese-game-creators-discuss-2026-ambitions">as translated by <em>Gematsu</em></a>, Silent Hill series producer Motoi Okamoto talked about the franchise’s current state and claimed that after releasing two critically acclaimed best-selling <em>Silent Hill</em> games in the last two years, the franchise is “back on track.” And it now sounds like we’ll be returning to the foggy streets of Silent Hill about once a year, assuming everything goes to plan.</p>

 <p>“Including both announced and unannounced [<em>Silent Hill</em> games], we’re aiming for a release pace of about one title per year,” Okamoto told <em>Famitsu</em> in its end-of-the-year issue. “I’m not sure how much of that we’ll be able to realize, but I’ll continue to do my best as producer of the <em>Silent Hill</em> series. Ideally, we’d like to keep excitement around the <em>Silent Hill</em> series going at all times. We’re working hard to share new updates, so I’d appreciate it if you could wait just a little longer.”</p>

  <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/silent-hill-2-remake-bloober-review-ps5-pc-horror-2024-1851665482">Before the excellent <em>Silent Hill 2</em> remake in October 2024</a>, the survival horror franchise had fallen into disrepair, with very few new entries, and the few games that did arrive were generally disappointing. Remember 2023’s <em>Silent Hill Accession</em>, that interactive livestream…thing? Bleh. And before that, the last real <em>Silent Hill</em> game we got was <a href="https://kotaku.com/silent-hill-downpour-made-you-the-monster-1832640116">2012’s <em>Downpour</em></a>, a forgettable and bland horror game that basically put the series on ice for a decade.</p>

 <p>Now, in 2025 and after two great games,<em> Silent Hill</em> is in a great place, and while I’m nervous about it becoming an annual franchise, I think <em>Silent Hill 2</em> and <em>f</em> show a path forward that could make this work. If different studios are brought in and allowed to play around with the franchise’s past as well as take it in new directions, we might be in for a golden age of <em>Silent Hill</em> games. And that seems to be Konami’s plan, <a href="https://kotaku.com/silent-hill-remake-2-f-bloober-team-cronos-2000630590">with a <em>Silent Hill 1</em> remake</a> in development as well as <a href="https://kotaku.com/silent-hill-ps5-townfall-ascension-konami-bloober-1849679202">a mysterious project, <em>Townfall.</em></a> Or maybe the franchise is about to fly off the rails again.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/sony-is-offloading-its-soundbar-with-a-bass-reflex-speaker-at-its-lowest-price-as-clearance-extends-beyond-headphones-2000655858</link>
            <guid>1393774</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>The Sony S100F 2.0ch Soundbar with Bass Reflex Speaker is a low-profile bar-style soundbar intended to enhance TV audio by adding clarity and punch without taking up too much space on your media stand. This compact unit features a 2.0-channel system with a built-in tweeter and Bass Reflex design, which helps voices sound clearer and adds weight to sound effects, unlike the thin speakers most televisions are equipped with.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5987/">Get the Sony S100F 2.0ch Soundbar with Bass Reflex Speaker for a discounted price of just $99, down from $160, saving you $62 and 38% off.</a></p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5987/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>A minimalistic way to add booming bass to your favorite content</h2>
<p>The sound characteristics of the S100F are optimized for better clarity of dialogue and more immersive TV experience. The 2.0 channel configuration, along with the built-in tweeter, provides crispness to high frequencies, while the Bass Reflex speaker provides more presence to lower-frequency sounds such as crowd noise, low rumbles, and music. Additionally, Sony’s S-Force Pro Front Surround processing attempts to create a wider sound area than the actual width of the bar itself, creating a more immersive experience for movies and television shows using only a single piece of equipment. There is also a voice enhancement feature that can increase dialogue levels during quiet scenes or loud soundtracks, making it easier to follow conversations without constantly adjusting the volume.</p>
<p>Physically, the S100F was designed to be placed in tight spaces. The soundbar sits relatively low, allowing it to be mounted below the bottom of many TV screens. If you prefer a clean appearance, the soundbar is wall-mountable. It comes with a template in the box that lets you accurately measure and mount the soundbar under a wall-mounted television with less trial-and-error.</p>



<p>The S100F includes simple-to-set-up connections. For example, HDMI ARC allows you to send audio from compatible televisions and also enables you to perform basic control functions via your television remote. Optical input allows you to connect older televisions to the S100F, and USB playback lets you insert a music-filled drive into the soundbar. Finally, there is Bluetooth support that converts the soundbar into a wireless speaker for your phone, tablet, or laptop when the screen is off.</p>
<p>The accessories and other small details included with the product make it seem ready to go right out of the box. In addition to the soundbar itself, you will receive a remote controller with batteries, an optical cable, an AC power cord, a wall-mount template, and installation guides and warranty documentation.</p>
<p>So, if you need a compact soundbar that improves dialogue clarity, adds a deeper bass response due to the Bass Reflex design, and includes both HDMI ARC and Bluetooth connectivity,<a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5987/"> the Sony S100F 2.0ch Soundbar with Bass Reflex Speaker available for purchase today at a reduced price of $99 versus the original MSRP of $160, is an obvious choice over standard TV audio.</a></p>

                                                      </p><div>
              
              <p>Honestly, at this point, it’s almost expected for any given MrBeast-based event to generate controversy, misery, and bullying. So perhaps it’s not surprising that the creator’s latest video, a <em>Minecraft</em>-based contest in which 500 men were pitted against 500 women, has resulted in accusations of cheating, sabotage, and transphobia.</p> <p>The video, which has already seen nearly 13 million views on Jimmy Donaldson’s MrBeast Gaming channel, was poorly organized from the start. Rather than recruiting players deliberately, the event accepted the first 500 men and 500 women who tried to join a server when it went live, naturally resulting in a chaotic selection. It also, according to <a href="https://x.com/ZavvyGamer/status/2005056800639394160">one person who claimed to have taken part</a>&nbsp;(thanks <a href="https://www.thegamer.com/mrbeast-minecraft-boy-girl-competition-scandal/"><em>TheGamer</em></a>), meant many of the women players were very obviously “Russian guys [using] AI images/deepfakes.”</p>

  <p>The purpose of the event, which was recorded over a week of three- to six-hour daily sessions, was to see which team would prevail in what the video claimed to be a simulation of “civilization.” You know, that type of civilization in which men and women live entirely separately, and are pitched against one another based on…their…um…for fuck’s sake.</p>

 <p>Of course, this being a MrBeast event, the whole thing was structured around requiring players to inevitably turn on each other. The side with the most players left after the week would share $50,000 between them, so it created the sophomoric dilemma of wanting to eliminate as many people on your team as you can, while still having more than the other side, and enough to win a war that was due to happen toward the end of the event.</p>

 <figure id="attachment_2000655930" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000655930"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000655930">© MrBeast Gaming / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p>In case there were any pretense at this being anything other than a retrograde endeavor, the whole thing was presented with every cliche in place. The video’s title card shows men in blue diamond armor, and <del>women</del> a woman in a pink dress, with the word “PEACE” above the pink lady side, and “WAR” over the legion of armed men. (Oh, and dividing the two is the <a href="https://www.collinsdictionary.com/dictionary/english/gurning">gurning</a> face of James “MrBeast” Donaldson himself, despite this being a co-production with YouTuber <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCF3KMM3QLVEfnFPI8AbLUJA">ish</a>.) Men are then presented as battling one another, fighting for dominance, while women are “making sure” others don’t get more attention, and “turning on each other.”</p>

 <p>“<span dir="auto"><span dir="auto">We had thousands of players try to join our first large scale, multi day, competition civilization event in a first come first serve basis,” says the video’s introduction without a single hyphen, and without ever going on to state what was intended to happen as a result. Instead, the bulk of the description is devoted to mitigating the enormous amount of cheating and bad play that took part, reading,</span></span></p>

 <blockquote><p>“<span dir="auto"><span dir="auto">If a player broke the rules they agreed to in any way or lied on their application about any information to try and sabotage other players, they were banned by the staff who were monitoring 24/7 after an investigation, their actions were reversed and players they killed were revived, and they were replaced with the next boy or girl in line who had tried to join the server earlier in chronological order.”</span></span></p></blockquote> <p>Zavvy, <a href="https://x.com/ZavvyGamer/status/2005056800639394160">who claims on X</a> to have been one of the participants, gave a damning report of the week-long event. Their first accusation is that Russian men were infiltrating the women’s team, then “mass murdering every girl they could see. This went on for irl DAYS.” They claim the same players also left signs around the map with sexist messages and images of swastikas.</p>

 <p>Despite the protestations in the video description, Zavvy claims that another player on the women’s team identified who many of these infiltrating players were, but was then unable to do anything about it until pressuring staff into adding a way to report them on the event’s Discord.</p> <p>The women’s team, naturally, featured trans women players, but after word got about about the trolling male players, Zavvy says that “a lot of girls began reporting/targeting our trans girlies as infiltrators just because of the pitches of their voices and it started this huge fight on the girls’ side about transphobia and such.”</p> <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">I was in this event. Please keep in mind that we only had like 3-6 hours of server time each day.</p> <p>"The girls' side fell apart for SOME REASON"</p> <p>1. We unironically had Russian guys use AI images/deepfakes to cheat their way onto the girls' side and then just start mass murdering… <a href="https://t.co/fxFKZHkEbA">https://t.co/fxFKZHkEbA</a></p> <p>— Zavvy 💜🎮 (@ZavvyGamer) <a href="https://twitter.com/ZavvyGamer/status/2005056800639394160?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 27, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <p>Despite ostensibly being an event about building “civilizations,” it soon became far more of a PvP event. I was unfortunate enough to overhear an awful lot of the 52-minute video as my son watched it, and the narration from both Donaldson and ish feigned bemusement at why the women were “turning on each other,” when it seems the reasons were widely reported and known. Zavvy also claims that the event had so much trouble filling the women’s team (and no wonder, good grief) that the Discord link was spread far and wide to try to reach the 500-player target. This resulted in many players who Zavvy says “didn’t even know how to make a crafting table.” The player then posted what they say are screenshots of signs and chat from the event in which abusive messages were posted in Russian.</p>

 <figure id="attachment_2000655927" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000655927"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000655927">© Zavvy / X</figcaption></figure> <p>Another person who says they were at the event, Code Mercy, corroborated Zavvy’s claims. As well as agreeing with all the previous claims, they add that players had been told “it was a social experiment to see how boys and girls would survive and thrive,” and given no idea there was to be any PvP.</p> <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">As someone who was in this event it was so poorly planned. Everything said above is correct. </p> <p>The story told obviously didn’t mention any of this going on. Heck some of the story was wrong anyways. Wrong leaders on girl side. Timing all wrong as I died and things that happened…</p> <p>— Code Mercy (@realcsgomercy) <a href="https://twitter.com/realcsgomercy/status/2005117682991988781?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 28, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <p>Still more <a href="https://x.com/XxMakio/status/2005122741523878265">players chimed in</a> to <a href="https://x.com/GGoobere/status/2005106728699134417">back up all the same claims</a>, contradicting the narrative presented in the video. The video, instead, included scripted, tiresomely obvious tropes of a stunningly organized women’s side, and a disloyal, fractured men’s side, all so this could be stunningly reversed later in the event.</p>

 <p><span>Of course, any video of this nature is—like reality TV—going to carve storylines from dozens of hours of footage across hundreds of different situations that don’t accurately reflect events. It’s inevitable, justified by the excuse that it makes for a better viewing experience. The issue is that it’s not a depiction of what actually happened, and when you’re a participant who is aware how poorly events are represented, and the genuinely serious issues that are written out of existence, speaking up is often the only way the truth gets heard.</span></p> <p><span>Given</span><a href="https://kotaku.com/ava-kris-tyson-mr-beast-grooming-allegations-1851606782"> <span>MrBeast’s own history with issues relating to transphobia</span></a><span>, it’s perhaps no surprise that the video didn’t want to portray the awful situation of trans women being hounded out of the game and the infiltration of bad actors that preceded it, despite its being so core to </span><i><span>why</span></i><span> what happened, happened. Far more fun to say, “Wow, those girls seemed so organized, but then it all turned to in-fighting!!!” right?</span></p> <p>Can we maybe all just move beyond “boys vs girls” as a concept? That’d be good.</p>

              <p>Leaks and analyst forecasts have fans buzzing about the possible hope for one last unexpected content update to <em>The Witcher 3</em>. <em>Helldivers 2</em> will continue to evolve in wild ways. And an older mobile JRPG that spawned two great console spin-offs is finally coming to PC in the West next year. It’s the latest edition of Morning Checkpoint, <em>Kotaku</em>‘s daily roundup of gaming news and culture.</p> <p>There’s only a few days left to go in 2025 and I will be spending at least one of those cleaning my PS5. It shut off from overheating three times during my <em>Nightreign</em> run last night. The Everdark Balancers had nothing on the giant dust bunnies roaming around inside my console.</p>

 <h2>Rumors keep swirling about new <em>Witcher 3</em> DLC</h2> <p>Polish leaker Borys Nieśpielak first claimed back <a href="https://www.pcgamesn.com/the-witcher-3-wild-hunt/dlc-game-awards">over the summer</a> that the decade-old game would get more content, adding earlier this month that he expected some sort of tease at the Game Awards. We didn’t get one, but that hasn’t put the rumors to bed. Now Polish Noble Securities analyst Mateusz Chrzanowski is forecasting a new DLC as well.</p>

 <p>“We expect another paid add-on (DLC) for <em>The Witcher 3</em> to be released in May 2026. We anticipate sales of 11 million copies at USD 30 each next year. We estimate the production budget at PLN 52 million,” he <a href="https://strefainwestorow.pl/analizy/noblesecurities-cdprojekt-wiedzmin-dlc-orion-cyberpunk">wrote in a memo</a> earlier this month according to a Google translation (via <a href="https://www.dexerto.com/gaming/new-witcher-3-dlc-expected-in-early-2026-to-set-up-the-witcher-4-3297731/"><em>Dexerto</em></a>). “The release should kick off the actual marketing campaign for <em>The Witcher 4</em>.”</p>

 <p>That seems both hard to believe and not completely unthinkable. The only known update CD Projekt Red is currently working on for the 2015 open-world RPG is mod support for the console version. A new content add-on, however small, would no doubt <a href="https://kotaku.com/cyberpunk-2-sales-witcher-4-cdpr-2000647747">help boost sales</a> of the current-gen version as the studio works on getting <em>The Witcher 4</em> done. The sequel still sounds so far out <a href="https://kotaku.com/witcher-4-2027-release-window-investor-call-ps6-cdpr-1851772310">it might be a PS6 game</a>.</p>

 <h2>The original <em>Granblue Fantasy</em> is finally coming to Steam over a decade later</h2>  <p>The 2014 mobile RPG behind spin-offs <em>Granblue Fantasy Versus: Rising</em> and <em>Granblue Fantasy: Relink</em> will be available for the first time in the West on PC starting March 10, 2026. It’s a turn-based game with summons, classes, and multiplayer raids that includes contributions from ex-<em>Final Fantasy</em> composer&nbsp;Nobuo Uematsu&nbsp;and&nbsp;art director Hideo Minaba.</p>

 <h2>Nvidia’s GeForce Now streaming program expands its monthly caps</h2> <p>A 100-hour monthly limit used to only apply to new subscribers. Now it will apply to everyone, <a href="https://www.pcmag.com/news/nvidia-geforce-nows-time-limit-will-stop-gamers-after-100-hours-each-month"><em>PCMag</em> reports</a>. GeForce Now users will have to pay an extra fee each month to continue streaming games beyond that. The price will be $3 for 15 more hours on the performance plan ($10 a month) and $6 for 15 more hours on the Ultimate plan ($20 a month). The move suggests Nvidia will continue looking to crack down on costs as the program grows.</p>

 <h2><em>Helldivers 2</em> could get “sequel-level” features like eight-player missions</h2> <p>“There’s quite a lot of [new features] actually and I think the community is pretty good at picking up where they sort of want the game to head when you consider sort of the sequel-esque approach to it,” creative director Johan Pilestedt said on a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QokA_oAk4ig">recent Arrow Game Studios livestream</a> (via <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/third-person-shooter/helldivers-2-cco-would-rather-add-sequel-level-features-like-8-player-missions-and-bigger-open-world-maps-than-outright-make-helldivers-3/"><em>Gamesradar</em></a>).&nbsp;“Eight-player missions would be one of those,” he continued. “Larger open-world maps where you maybe come across other Helldiver teams to then take on bigger challenges together. Operations that affect other teams, as well, would be those kind of level of features.”</p> <div> <h2>Will we see Arkane’s<em> Blade</em> game in 2026?</h2> <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">The team is hard at work, everyone is super proud and out doing themselves.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>How can you improve your productivity when you’re on the go? A second monitor can do the trick. But don’t just go plunk down cash on the first thing you see out there. Not when you can save some money instead.</p>
<p>If you want to bring home a portable monitor that combines portability with use as a gaming, streaming and/or multi-tasking device, the ARZOPA 16.1″ 144Hz Portable Gaming Monitor is the answer. And right now, it’s on sale for what you might think is a pretty reasonable price.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6601/">You can order the ARZOPA 16.1″ 144Hz Portable Gaming Monitor on Amazon for just $96.99, which is $33 less than its original list price of $129.99.</a> That’s a 25% discount.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6601/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>A portable monitor perfect for gaming and productivity</h2>
<p>Though this is a somewhat budget-priced screen, the screen is still quite sharp and vivid. It has a rapid 144Hz refresh rate so movement in video games and movies appears more smoothly than you might get with traditional 60Hz screens.</p>
<p>The increased smoothness can give you a competitive advantage in certain gaming genres like racing games, first person shooters, and other fast-paced titles. In addition, the monitor’s heightened response rate can let you scroll through pages online and take care of most of your daily tasks even faster than usual.</p>
<p>In terms of keeping busiy on the go, this portable monitor was created to be taken with you when you travel. It’s super light so you can easily carry it to another location, and it’s designed to be used in many different types of environments like as a friend’s house, travel, or a coffee shop where you’d like to set up a second monitor. It connects to devices like your laptop, Nintendo Switch, handheld gaming consoles, and other phones that are capable of displaying images on an external monitor. All you have to do is connect a cable without extensive setup. And you’re good to go.</p>



<p>The build quality of the ARZOPA portable gaming monitor is pretty sturdy for the price, too. The included stand folds out so you can place it at a viewing angle that fits comfortably on your desk or tabletop. Therefore, you can adjust the viewing position of the screen to fit the way your desk is configured, rather than having to awkwardly tilt your laptop screen or stack books underneath it. The thin design of the monitor will help reduce clutter on your desk when it is not being used.</p>
<p>Overall, the high refresh rate, portability, and ease of setup of the ARZOPA 16.1″ 144Hz Portable Gaming Monitor make it an excellent companion for gaming and productivity. If you don’t want to drag around a second full-size monitor but need more screen real estate than a phone or tablet can provide, this is a great and affordable pick that’ll get you together.</p>

              <p>Over the weekend, Ubisoft’s&nbsp;<em>Rainbow 6 Siege </em>suffered a major hack that saw players flooded with billions of dollars worth of in-game credits. As a result, Ubisoft pulled the game and its marketplace offline. Only in the last few hours has it begun allowing players back in.</p> <p>Ubisoft posted to <a href="https://x.com/Rainbow6Game/status/2004917731829948808"><em>Rainbow 6</em>‘s official X account</a> on December 27 that it was “aware of an incident” and “working on a resolution.” A couple of hours later another update added, “<span>Siege and the Marketplace have been intentionally shut down while the team focuses on resolving the issue.”</span></p>

 <p>The incident was an apparent attack on <a href="https://www.ubisoft.com/en-gb/game/rainbow-six/siege/status">the&nbsp;<em>R6</em> servers</a> that saw not only billions of in-game money distributed among players, but also super-rare weapon skins landing in some people’s lockers, Renown being handed out like candy, and Alpha Packs showing up in inventories as well. At the same time, some players reported having their in-game finances entirely wiped out.</p>

 <p>Unfortunately, there followed an ominous five hours of silence from the Ubisoft team, during which all manner of rumors spread among the game’s community, including that the attack was a cover for stealing all of Ubisoft’s source code (there is no evidence for this), and that anyone who spent the vast amounts of new money they now found in their account would be banned.</p>

 <p>The latter rumor became extremely prevalent across social media and Reddit largely because before the shutdown, an in-game ban ticker had been spamming announcements across players’ screens for huge numbers of bans! When Ubisoft finally updated its X account, it was to make clear this was not true.</p>

 <p>“Nobody will be banned for spending credits received,” said the post, noting “any messages seen were not triggered by us.” But for those thinking Christmas had happened all over again added, “a rollback of all transactions that occurred since 11 AM (UTC time) is underway.”</p>

 <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">➡️ Nobody will be banned for spending credits received. A rollback of all transactions that occurred since 11 AM (UTC time) is underway.</p> <p>➡️ The ban ticker was turned off in a past update. Any messages seen were not triggered by us.</p> <p>➡️ An official R6 ShieldGuard ban wave did… <a href="https://t.co/zbPYDJQa3O">https://t.co/zbPYDJQa3O</a></p> <p>— Rainbow Six Siege X (@Rainbow6Game) <a href="https://twitter.com/Rainbow6Game/status/2005018314431447283?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 27, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <p>With the game offline, Ubisoft again went very quiet, this time for 21 hours. (Social media teams: please don’t do this! Even if you have no news, post to say so! Reassure people it’s being worked on. Yes, you’re all in a crazed panic, but someone can write a sentence on X and stave off a <em>vast</em> amount of misinformation and player distress. Have you never had a flight delayed?) Sunday at lunchtime, <a href="https://x.com/Rainbow6Game/status/2005329908105359712">a post appeared</a> explaining that<em> Rainbow Six Siege</em> was being rolled back to its pre-hack state followed by “extensive quality control tests” to ensure “the integrity of accounts and effectiveness of changes.” The update continued, seemingly addressing nearly a day’s panic from the <em>R6</em> community,</p>

 <blockquote><p>“<span>The team is focused on getting players back into the game as quickly as possible. Please know that this matter is being handled with extreme care and therefore, timing cannot be guaranteed. We will provide another update as soon as we know more. Thank you all for your patience and understanding as we continue to tackle this.”</span></p></blockquote> <p>Seven hours later, the tests were complete, and a soft launch began, allowing a few players back in to see if anything exploded. Then by last night, <em>Rainbow 6 </em>was re-opened to everyone, with the game’s state rolled back to early Saturday morning. All purchases made, whether legitimate or with the unexpected pirate bounty, were undone, and freebies handed out were removed from accounts. It was also noted that “<span>A small percentage of players may temporarily lose access to some owned items. Investigations and corrections will continue over the next two weeks.”</span></p>   <p>The Marketplace, however, remains offline “as further investigations continue.”</p> <p>This isn’t the first time&nbsp;<em>Rainbow 6 Siege</em> has taken a big hit in 2025. Back in June, <a href="https://www.wsj.com/business/earnings/ubisoft-sales-miss-forecasts-as-rainbow-six-siege-glitch-takes-toll-fd2a6519">another glitch involving prepaid cards</a> that saw in-game money inflated cost Ubisoft significant losses, and this holiday attack could do much the same.</p>

 <p>It was, given the scale of the attack, an impressively swift repair, all done and dusted within 48 hours. The only issue, as appears to always be the case in such incidents, was a lack of regular communication with players to quash rumors and disinformation. It does, of course, raise significant questions over the security surrounding&nbsp;<em>R6 Siege X</em>, given that this was possible in the first place. There has been no announcement either way about whether player account information was seen or stolen, but people with accounts might want to change their passwords just in case. There has also been no information about what actually allowed the attack, and whether it can happen again.</p>
