              <p><span>Ludovic Mbock, a competitive FGC player known for playing games like </span><i><span>Street Fighter </span></i><span>and </span><i><span>King of Fighters</span></i><span>, has reportedly been detained by ICE. His friends and family are asking for financial support to cover legal fees and work toward his release.</span></p> <p><span>The </span><a href="https://www.gofundme.com/f/support-ludovics-legal-defense"><span>GoFundMe</span></a><span> campaign set up by organizer David Hazlewood says that any money donated will go toward “securing legal representation, covering legal fees, and providing direct assistance Ludovic needs during this challenging time.” The current goal is $50,000, and it has already accumulated over $41,000 in just one day.</span></p>

 <p><span>“Please help Ludovic, who is a wonderful and kind person that makes the world a better place. America is better with him here,” Hazlewood writes.</span></p> <p><span>Details are scarce on exactly when, where, and how Mbock was detained. According to </span><a href="https://bsky.app/profile/samred.com/post/3mf6olxcfic23"><span>a post on Bluesky</span></a><span> from writer Sam Machkovech, Mbock emigrated from Cameroon and has lived in the U.S. for “more than half his life, having graduated from a MD high school in 2006.” As news of Mbock’s situation spread, the fighting game community and his teammates in The Hiero Group have been sharing the GFM and pleading with the public for financial support.</span></p>

              <p>If you, like me, have been keeping up with<em> Highguard</em>, well, there’s good news. Despite last week’s studio layoffs and the <a href="https://kotaku.com/highguard-update-roadmap-servers-discord-2000670633">radio silence afterwards</a>, Wildlight Entertainment’s hero shooter has snuck out a new content drop. It includes a new map and raiding item, as well as new mounts that look like <em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons</em>‘ Owlbears. But the real pocket of hope is a new mode the developers are teasing based around what <em>Highguard</em> does best: raids.</p> <p>“This patch is purely content focused, with a brand new Base and a powerful new Raid Tool added to the game, along with new offerings in the Store,” <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/4128260/view/518613150889673564">read the patch notes</a> on Steam. “We are also working on next week’s patch, which we aim to bring a new game mode focused on the Raid experience, as well as some balance adjustments to weapons, among other things.”</p> <p>The “Raid experience,” for folks who bounced off <em>Highguard</em> at launch or haven’t given it a try, is when one team is breaching a base and trying to plant bombs on objectives to blow it up. There’s a bit of <em>Rainbow Six Siege</em> sprinkled in with destructible walls and gadgets that assist with breaching, including zip-lines you can shoot out from a siege tower to quickly get behind enemy lines. It’s usually the best part of any match and is where the real promise of <em>Highguard</em> begins to break through. A new mode that serves that up in a more concentrated form could work really well.</p> <p>Wildlight still hasn’t given an update on just how the old content roadmap is being modified or scrapped, but that new mode is supposed to arrive next week. In the meantime, however, this week’s patch will add the Cloudbreach map which takes place at the launchpad for a giant airship, and the Lockpick, a new item that lets you shoot a dart at doors and windows to take control of them away from the enemy during raids. A purple variant will even add an electric shock that zaps enemies nearby. Plus there’s new Moonbruin Mounts which look cool, though good luck <a href="https://kotaku.com/highguard-layoffs-dead-game-awards-live-service-2000668192">getting anyone to spend money</a> on <em>Highguard</em> right now.</p>
