              <p>“Hell is empty and all the devils are here.” That quote from Shakespeare’s <em>The Tempest</em> is how the debut trailer for hack-and-slash adventure game <em>Fallen</em> begins. It was accurate if you count among those devils <a href="https://kotaku.com/hooded-horse-gen-ai-art-ban-4x-strategy-steam-2000658179">the scourge of AI slop</a>. The trailer, an<em> IGN</em> exclusive, was flamed on social media for appearing to showcase gen AI work, and the developer of the game later confirmed it.</p> <p>The <em>Fallen</em> trailer <a href="https://x.com/IGN/status/2013061346544205904">appeared on X on Monday</a> where it immediately made a splash far beyond what you might have expected from its otherwise generic-looking, demon-slaying gameplay. “Introducing <em>Fallen</em>, a new Xbox 360-era inspired character action game where you play as Astra, a fallen angel who must battle through Hell and its demonic forces. It’s in development for console and PC,” read the marketing copy.</p>

 <p>But what stood out to people immediately was the now familiar whiff of slick but lifeless gen AI-produced art that was peppered throughout the trailer. “It looks nauseatingly bad, genAI isn’t just walking back gaming hardware, it’s trying to make the games themselves awful too,” <a href="https://x.com/kitty_bit_games/status/2013287905272148309">wrote</a> cosplayer Kitty Bit. “This is the most AI ass AI video game I ever did see lmao,” <a href="https://x.com/Ms5000Watts/status/2013103413656248810">wrote</a> Twitch streamer Ms5000watts. “<span dir="auto" role="text">Looks like a weird amalgamation of AI and jank,” read one of the top YouTube comments.&nbsp;</span></p> <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">They aren't even trying to hide it brah😭😭AI slop content is off the charts now <a href="https://t.co/uWFQdopCy8">https://t.co/uWFQdopCy8</a> <a href="https://t.co/b0B9Jnm8aq">pic.twitter.com/b0B9Jnm8aq</a></p> <p>— Oshbard (@Ludvicus) <a href="https://twitter.com/Ludvicus/status/2013329329246105904?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 19, 2026</a></p></blockquote>  <p>Was this another example of people being paranoid about gen AI and jumping the gun with the accusations of slop? Nope! Superboo Studios founder, director, producer, and writer Brooke Burgess admitted as much after the backlash, but claimed the gameplay was real and in-engine UE5.4 work. Burgess blamed “context” collapse for the controversy.</p>

 <p>“What ended up being shared as an ‘official trailer’ was actually our early dev ‘tone pitch’, i.e., a work-in-progress UE5 teaser designed for funding discussions,” he <a href="https://www.thegamer.com/fallen-gen-ai-real-in-engine-ue54-work/">told <em>TheGamer</em></a>. “There are [AI-Generated] placeholders in there, specifically some 2D test assets used to explore mood and presentation (for example, how ‘lost souls’ and fallen angels in the game might react when spoken to and judged, along w/ WIP HUD elements). That material was never intended as final content, nor as a statement on how the shipped game would be made.”</p>

 <figure id="attachment_2000661842" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000661842"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000661842">YouTube</figcaption></figure> <p>To go back to referencing Shakespeare for a moment, Burgess seems to be suggesting that “the fault, dear Brutus, is not in our ‘tone pitch AI placeholders,’ but in ourselves.” He makes it sound like <em>IGN</em> posted the wrong trailer, or jumped the gun. In actuality, Burgess has had <a href="https://www.canva.com/design/DAGjCTo9iLU/7_O1MHOJhcdacvds06knLg/edit">no qualms about using AI slop</a> to pitch the game to potential investors.</p> <p>In fact, he recently complained about just how hard it is to raise money for making a game right now. Burgess said every publisher he’s spoken to is asking how he’ll us AI to streamline development. He’s open to using it for QA and localization, but claims he’s not “waving the flag of AI by any stretch.” but claims he’s not “waving the flag of AI by any stretch.”</p>

 <p>“I’m not going to sell my soul and be like, ‘Yeah, I’ll do it by myself, let me prompt this whole game into existence,'” he recently told <em><a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/fallen-creator-brooke-burgess-on-the-struggle-to-get-game-funding-above-1-million" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">GamesIndustry.Biz</a></em>. “No, I want to work with really talented people and make something cool. But if integrating it in a way that doesn’t affect creativity, but helps to save a little bit of money and gets the game out there to people, and gives us a chance to make something cool and memorable, and then make something else after that–it’s something I have to factor in.”</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Fallout Season 2 Finally Brings Back Two Classic Pieces Of The Franchise]]></title>

            <guid>1412047</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/fallout-tv-series-season-two-reviews-prime-video-2000653876"><em>Fallout</em> season two</a>‘s latest episode provided one of the coolest reveals in the show’s run and was also a great moment for fans of “Pointing at the TV and going ‘Oh crap!'” in front of their friends and then getting to explain why they were so excited.</p> <p>But wait. Before we go any further, we’re about to completely spoil that cool moment (and only that moment) from season two, episode six of Amazon’s <em>Fallout</em> show that brings back not one, but two classic elements from the old <a href="https://kotaku.com/fallout-76-easter-egg-pokes-fun-at-lore-inconsistencies-1830500018"><em>Fallout</em></a> games. So if you want to avoid that, this is the part where you turn around and never look back. Everyone else, keep scrolling.</p>

  <p>After being super-punched through a window at the end of the last episode and left for dead by Lucy, the Ghoul is saved from his spikey predicament by a large, strange-looking figure. That figure is revealed to be a Super Mutant. Yup, the <em>Fallout</em> show has finally brought these big ol’ bastards into the series, and I’m happy to see they aren’t the brutish-looking monsters so frequently depicted in Bethesda’s <em>Fallout</em> games. Instead, this Super Mutant looks and sounds a lot like the kind seen in the older <em>Fallout</em> CRPGs and<em> New Vegas.</em></p> <p>Technically, <a href="https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Super_mutant_(TV_series)?file=The_Target_-_Mutant_corpse.png">a dead Super Mutant appeared in season one in an Enclave base</a>, though we only saw its large green hand sticking out from underneath a sheet. But this is the first time we’ve seen a living Super Mutant in the show. That alone would be cool enough, but there’s more to this moment. The actor behind the Super Mutant makeup is Ron Perlman, a man who has a long history with the <em>Fallout</em> franchise.</p>

 <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">SUPER MUTANT have arrived in <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/Fallout?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#Fallout</a> and he wanted o join Ghoul in his kind <a href="https://t.co/30PD4PpZ0p">pic.twitter.com/30PD4PpZ0p</a></p> <p>— sanmeyo (@oyemnassxo) <a href="https://twitter.com/oyemnassxo/status/2013911587736916414?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 21, 2026</a></p></blockquote>  <p>The movie and TV actor has acted as a narrator in most of the <a href="https://kotaku.com/fallout-3-new-vegas-remake-remaster-mods-2000661284"><em>Fallout</em> games</a>, including the original ones back in the ’90s. He’s the guy who famously says, “War. War never changes,” at the start of so many <em>Fallout</em> adventures, and who also often provides a recap of your choices and their outcomes at the end. He also appears in <em>Fallout 4</em> as a TV newscaster you can hear in the background during the game’s intro.&nbsp; And now he’s here for the <em>Fallout</em> TV show, and I’m very happy about it.</p>

 <p>It’s good to have you back, Perlman. <a href="https://kotaku.com/fallout-ron-perlman-s3-intro-sandwhich-war-2000660136">Hopefully, you got paid more than $40 and a sandwich for this role.&nbsp;</a></p> <p>Perlman’s Super Mutant character, after saving the Ghoul, mentions that the ones to blame for all of this are the Enclave, a mysterious group of fascists that planned to take over the United States before the bombs fell. The group later claimed to be the inheritors of the United States’ power and authority after the world ended. And it seems they are going to play a big role in the final episodes of <em>Fallout</em> season two.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/amazon-fire-tv-soundbar-plus-is-already-getting-its-second-price-cut-this-year-hitting-another-record-low-2000661451</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Most modern TVs deliver impressive visuals, but the built-in sound quality usually doesn’t keep up. Not being able to hear the dialogue and music properly can be frustrating, but you don’t have to put up with that.</p>
<p>This is where a dedicated soundbar can help, and today is an excellent time to invest in one. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4053/">Amazon just knocked a solid 30% off the latest Fire TV Soundbar Plus, bringing its price down to $175</a>. You’re saving a nice $75 on a solution that’s going to make your favorite TV shows and movies a lot more enjoyable by delivering an immersive experience. Just note that deals this good don’t tend to stick around. It’s worth acting sooner rather than later to grab it.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4053/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Superior Sound</h2>
<p>This minimal soundbar features an elegant, no-fuss design. You can place it on your console or mount it on the wall for an even cleaner setup; whichever you prefer. Sound-wise, it covers more than just the basics. There are three full-range speakers, three tweeters, and two woofers, all of which come together to push sound in every direction, instead of just blasting it from the front. Clear audio with deep bass surrounds you from all sides with Dolby Atmos and DTS:X support, making it feel like you’re right in the middle of the action.</p>
<p>Dialogs get better, too. That’s thanks to the dedicated center dialogue channel that sharpens conversations to help you catch every mumble and whisper. You won’t have to constantly rewind to hear what was said or rely on subtitles to understand the context. Basically, whether you’re watching something action-packed or winding down with a slow, romantic Korean show, you’ll enjoy each sound and every tune just how the creator intended. This 3D setup is also great for watch parties at home, as it ensures everyone enjoys clear, immersive sound no matter where they’re seated in the room.</p>



<p>You can also choose between multiple sound modes, which automatically optimize audio based on what you’re watching. These include Movie, Music, Sports, and Night modes. For instance, the movie mode offers better dialog clarity, while the music mode pumps up the bass. The night mode, on the other hand, reduces the overall volume so you don’t wake the rest of the house. What’s more, the soundbar can double as a speaker, as it lets you wirelessly connect devices like your smartphone and tablet via Bluetooth easily. Use it to catch up on the latest episode of your favorite podcast, or vibe to some music while finishing up chores around the house!</p>
<p>Getting started is straightforward. All you need to do is connect the included HDMI cable to your TV’s HDMI eARC/ARC port. Once the TV recognizes the soundbar, follow the on-screen instructions to complete the setup process. Compatibility-wise, the soundbar plays nicely with a range of smart TVs and TVs connected to streaming media players. You can also control it using the same remote you already use for your TV.</p>
<p>Everything considered, it’s a great option to invest in if you want to enjoy better sound for all your content. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4053/">It’s now down to $175 after a 30% discount, but the offer won’t be around for long. It’s best to grab it fast to avoid paying the full price later.</a></p>

<p>That’s basically nothing considering all the features this tiny but mighty mouse is packed with. This price also matches its all-time low from last year. Just be sure to pick it up before the offer expires, or the stock runs out.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6807/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Packs a Punch</h2>

<p>The low-latency performance makes the V3 faster than most options in the same range, while the Razer 5G advanced 18K optical sensor ensures 99.4% tracking accuracy with up to 18,000 DPI. Translation? Incredible precision and speed that gives you a competitive edge in action-packed games where every second counts. You can even improve the accuracy further by disabling the “Enhance pointer precision” option in the Windows mouse settings. Those looking for more control can use the Razer Synapse app for advanced customization.</p>



<p>Durability comes from new gold-plated contact points that make the switches less prone to degradation. You’ll appreciate the longer lifespan of up to 60 million clicks, which ensures you keep enjoying consistent performance for years to come.</p>
<p>Additionally, Razor Chroma RGBL integration lets you customize the mouse using 16.8 million colors and countless lighting effects. The mouse reacts dynamically with countless Chroma-integrated games for an immersive experience that makes you feel like a part of the action. Battery life is just as impressive. You’re looking at up to 535 hours on Bluetooth and 285 hours on Razer HyperSpeed wireless. Basically, you won’t have to worry about running out of power in the middle of teaching bag guys a lesson. This also makes the mouse easy (and reliable) to take with you on your trips. Game wherever you want, however you want!</p>
<p>The mouse is compatible with a range of devices and gadgets, so you can play on your preferred one with ease. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6807/">The Basilik V3 is now down to just $48, from its already-affordable $70 price</a>.
