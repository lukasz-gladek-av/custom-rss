The HBO live-action adaptation will be based on <em>The Last of Us Part II</em>, and anyone who’s played it knows it builds heavily off the first game’s ending. As such, showrunners Craig Mazin and Neil Druckmann are doing promotional interviews for the new season and were naturally asked by <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.ign.com/articles/the-last-of-us-hbo-creators-answer-whether-or-not-joel-was-right-to-save-ellie&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-last-of-us-hbo-creators-answer-whether-or-not-joel-was-right-to-save-ellie" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>IGN</em></a></span> about the moral conundrum presented at the end of the first game. And y’all, I think it’s bizarre that someone who led two of my favorite games of all time manages to make them less interesting every time he weighs in on their characters’ actions.</p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="197298" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="Live Forever in the Universe of 'New World: Aeternum'" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="108" data-playlist="197298,197284,197260" data-current="197298"><div><p>Live Forever in the Universe of 'New World: Aeternum'</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197298/197298_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197298/197298_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197298/197298_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197298/197298_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"></video></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><figure id="" data-id="afpvuwnfoibrncd6upmy" data-recommend-id="image://afpvuwnfoibrncd6upmy" data-format="png" data-width="800" data-height="88" data-lightbox="true" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><span data-id="afpvuwnfoibrncd6upmy" data-recommend-id="image://afpvuwnfoibrncd6upmy" data-format="png" data-width="800" data-height="88" data-lightbox="true" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>At the end of the first <em>Last of Us</em>, blue-collar dad turned post-apocalyptic smuggler Joel goes on a rampage through a hospital, killing high-ranking members of the resistance group known as the Fireflies. He does this to save Ellie, his cargo-turned-surrogate-daughter, who was nearly killed in order to salvage the mutated cordyceps fungus in her brain that could help to make a vaccine. It’s a difficult situation, the morality of which fans have debated for over a decade. Was Joel right to save someone he cared about from certain death and, in so doing, doom humanity? Did he have any right to make that decision without Ellie’s consent? Did the doctors who were ready to kill her without asking what she wanted have the responsibility to do what they thought was right for the greater good? All of these are good questions. <em>The Last of Us Part II</em> explores them through shifting perspectives, and the sequel manages to end on a note that acknowledges all of them with equal weight.</p><p>Meanwhile, Druckmann and Mazin have expressed to <em>IGN</em> that they see Joel as in the right, even if Mazin is unsure if he could follow through on such a plan.</p><p>“I believe Joel was right,” Druckmann said to <em>IGN</em>. “If I were in Joel’s position, I hope I would be able to do what he did to save my daughter.”</p><p>“That’s so interesting, because I think that if I were in Joel’s position, I probably would have done what he did,” Mazin said. “But I’d like to think that I wouldn’t. That’s the interesting push and pull of the morality of it. And that’s why the ending of the first game is so provocative and so wonderful. It just doesn’t let you off the hook as a player.”</p><p>I could drag Druckmann and Mazin for trying to definitively weigh in on the foundational debate that has been the lifeblood of <em>The Last of Us</em> for a decade, but I will at least couch this all as them being asked about their personal belief, rather than arguing that the text is explicitly making one case or the other. (I would argue, however, that the TV show tries <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/last-of-us-tlou-hbo-show-finale-joel-lies-ellie-part-ii-1850209559&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/last-of-us-tlou-hbo-show-finale-joel-lies-ellie-part-ii-1850209559">real hard to shift us away</a></span> from condemning his actions entirely.) However, after following this series for so long, I always leave Druckmann interviews feeling like what I find profound about these games is just a series of happy accidents. <em>The Last of Us Part II </em>can’t just be a meditation on grief that uses violence as a language when Druckmann is talking about it as if the game is meant to <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.washingtonpost.com/graphics/2020/video-games/news/the-last-of-us-part-2-ellie-evolution/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/graphics/2020/video-games/news/the-last-of-us-part-2-ellie-evolution/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">scold the player for taking violent actions they have no say in</a></span>, or when he’s <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.vice.com/en/article/the-not-so-hidden-israeli-politics-of-the-last-of-us-part-ii/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/the-not-so-hidden-israeli-politics-of-the-last-of-us-part-ii/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">citing the Israel and Palestine conflict as an inspiration</a></span> for the game’s cycle of violence in a comparison that has only gotten more fraught since the game launched in 2020.

But we live in a world where marketing multi-million dollar projects requires interviews, and some audiences need to be told how they’re supposed to feel about something by the person who made it.</p><p>That’s not a <em>Last of Us</em>-specific problem. The modern Wikipediafication of art means everyone’s looking for definitive facts to point to and regurgitate in order to justify everything they feel with cold hard evidence. Sometimes, it feels like modern pop culture discourse is uncomfortable with questions that can’t be easily moralized. We’re seeing it right now with the <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/severance-season-2-finale-gemma-mark-helly-choice-ship-1851771965&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/severance-season-2-finale-gemma-mark-helly-choice-ship-1851771965">ending of <em>Severance</em>’s second season</a></span>. I’m curious to see how a much larger audience reacts to the complexities of <em>The Last of Us Part II</em>’s story when season two premieres on April 13.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

This is where their most obvious differences come into play: mobility and defense. The Heavy Bowgun, true to its name,restricts your hunter to pretty slow movement. For the cost of slow movement, however, this weapon lets you guard and even trigger a Power Clash against monster attacks.</p><p>The Light Bowgun doesn’t slow your hunter down and ends up feeling a lot smoother in comparison. It lacks the option to guard, but offsets this with fun movement options such as a sidestep and slide. Rapid Fire Mode expands upon these and incorporates a strafing dodge that lets you keep shooting called Burst Step.</p><p>I’ll also add that both weapons (and in particular the Heavy Bowgun) are great to use on your Seikret. Being limited to only standard fire and Focus Blasts while mounted isn’t that restrictive with so many ammo types.</p><h2 id="h281724"><a id=""></a>Rate of fire and damage</h2><figure id="" data-id="133022d7f7e7b206f4f92ca8d466b98d" data-recommend-id="image://133022d7f7e7b206f4f92ca8d466b98d" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A Congala is pelted by a Light Bowgun." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A Congala is pelted by a Light Bowgun." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Capcom / Samuel Moreno / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="133022d7f7e7b206f4f92ca8d466b98d" data-recommend-id="image://133022d7f7e7b206f4f92ca8d466b98d" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A Congala is pelted by a Light Bowgun." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Although the standard fire for either weapon can use the same ammo, there are still some important differences. With the Heavy Bowgun, you’ll deal with a slower rate of fire and strong damage numbers. The range for critical damage also tends to be a bit farther away from your targets.</p><p>All of that is naturally reversed with the Light Bowgun. Your shots come out faster, but they won’t hit as hard. I’ve also noticed that the critical damage range is comparatively closer across all ammo types.</p><h2 id="h281725"><a id=""></a>Special modes and ammo</h2><figure id="" data-id="fa5022c41dfaa01b25166c385820dc87" data-recommend-id="image://fa5022c41dfaa01b25166c385820dc87" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The Customize Bowgun screen, highlighting Special Ammo choices." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="The Customize Bowgun screen, highlighting Special Ammo choices." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Capcom / Samuel Moreno / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="fa5022c41dfaa01b25166c385820dc87" data-recommend-id="image://fa5022c41dfaa01b25166c385820dc87" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The Customize Bowgun screen, highlighting Special Ammo choices." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Each of these has access to a secondary firing mode and choices for Special Ammo.

When it comes to the Bowguns, some ammo types are just a better fit on one or the other. Pierce Ammo is arguably the best ammo type in the game and works well for either weapon. I’ve enjoyed using it on the Heavy Bowgun more, simply due to how much damage it does.</p><p>Ammo associated with elements or status ailments meanwhile shine with the Light Bowgun. Any extra elemental-based damage adds up nicely with all the rounds you shoot off. Similarly, it’s a lot easier to trigger a status effect when you’re constantly hitting a monster with status ailment ammo.</p><p>Both bowguns are fantastic tools that serve as excellent secondary weapons if you prefer having a melee as your primary.
