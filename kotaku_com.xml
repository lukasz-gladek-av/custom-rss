              <p>LEGO rarely slashes the prices on its Star Wars sets aggressively since they sell at full retail throughout most of the year. This R2-D2 building set just became <strong>the first major Star Wars release</strong> to see a substantial Black Friday discount, <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4474/">now sitting at $79 instead of the usual $99 price tag</a>. That’s a new all-time low on a set that already flies off the shelves with its nearly <strong>perfect 4.9 out of 5 stars rating</strong> across thousands of reviews.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4474/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>1,050 Pieces That Build an Iconic Droid</h2>
<p>This completed model of R2-D2 <strong>is over 9 inches tall, with a 6-inch width and a 4-inch depth</strong>, and offers significant desk or shelf presence without dominating entire surfaces. The cylindrical body features curved bricks and plates to achieve R2-D2’s characteristic dome shape and blue-white color scheme. The detail work features printed tiles for control panels, sensor arrays, and characteristic red and blue panels that help define R2-D2’s look throughout the Star Wars films.</p>
<p>Functional features add play value <strong>beyond static display</strong>: The dome head rotates 360 degrees with smooth action, letting you position R2-D2 looking in any direction. A detachable third leg extends from the body, recreating the droid’s mobility configuration seen throughout the original trilogy. An attachable periscope replicates the scanning device R2-D2 deploys in various scenes and additional tool attachments represent the droid’s utility arms and mechanical appendages.</p>



<p>Accompanying the set is a bonus 25th Anniversary Darth Malak mini-figure to commemorate LEGO Star Wars’ quarter-century of releases. Darth Malak originates from the Knights of the Old Republic video game era and represents deep-cut Star Wars lore instead of the usual movie characters that casual fans may be more familiar with. The minifigure sports unique printing, with Malak’s distinctive metal jaw prosthesis and Sith robes.</p>
<p>The building complexity is firmly in the intermediate range and thus appropriate for the 10-plus age recommendation. The instruction manual breaks construction into clearly numbered steps across multiple bags, letting you build the model over several sessions without losing track of progress. Younger builders might need adult assistance with some of the curved sections where brick placement becomes less intuitive. The <strong>1,050-piece count delivers several hours of building time</strong>, and lands between a quick evening project and a multi-day marathon build.</p>



<p>Color accuracy matches R2-D2’s on-screen appearance using bright blue, white, and light gray elements. Recent improvements to LEGO’s color palette mean that the blues match between different batches and piece types, avoiding some of the color variation issues that affected some of their older sets. Specialized curved and angled pieces create smooth surfaces rather than a stepped, pixelated look, common in early LEGO character attempts.</p>
<p>At $79, you’re paying roughly $0.075 per piece which falls below typical LEGO Star Wars pricing that usually hovers around $0.10 per piece. Licensed sets command premium pricing compared to generic LEGO themes which makes any discount on Star Wars releases noteworthy.</p>

              <p>Most of us wait for year-end sales to grab big-ticket items, and it’s finally that time of the year. Black Friday is still a week away, but you don’t have to wait till then to start saving. Early deals are coming in hot already!</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5664/">Those who have been looking to upgrade their gaming setup for less can now grab the 27-inch LG UltraGear OLED gaming monitor for just $500 on Amazon, after a massive 44% drop in its retail price of $900</a>. It’s definitely not your average markdown, as most other options with somewhat similar spec sheets sit well over $1,000. But as you’d expect, it’s a limited-time discount. The retailer hasn’t mentioned when the deal ends, but based on past trends, it’s safe to say it won’t be around for long. Hurry to grab yours before the price goes back up, or the stock expires for good.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5664/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Brilliant Color Accuracy for Lifelike Visuals</h2>
<p>The size is fairly decent. It’s not too big to take over your entire desk space, nor too small to make everything feel cramped; just the right size. The 27-inch screen supports VESA DisplayHDR True Black 400, which offers brilliant color accuracy, especially in scenes with low light. The 1.5 million:1 contrast ratio paired with 98.5% DCI-P3 color coverage makes sure all your favorite content appears lifelike, just how the creator intended. You’ll get brighter highlights in daylight scenes and excellent clarity in the dark, which is great for spotting the bad guys hidden in the shadows.</p>



<p>The screen also has an anti-glare, low-reflection coating that makes it easier on the eyes. You won’t have to fight reflections in brighter settings or squint to see what’s on screen during the day.</p>
<p>Performance-wise, you’re getting a 240Hz refresh rate and an ultra-responsive 0.03ms GtG response time for ultra-fast, smooth gameplay. It’s officially G-SYNC Compatible and supports AMD FreeSync Premium Pro, meaning you’ll enjoy exceptional performance regardless of the GPU at hand.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5664/">You also have the option to make height, tilt, and pivot adjustments as you like. Sitting back or playing while standing – the monitor stays at just the right angle.</a> For connectivity, there are both HDMI 2.1 and DisplayPort 1.4 options, plus you even get a 2-year warranty on the OLED panel with your purchase for some extra peace of mind. Get your orders in before it shoots back up!</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/take-two-strauss-zelnick-gta-6-pc-console-exclusive-2000645103</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/take-two-ceo-says-consoles-won%E2%80%99t-die-but-pc-is-the-future.1356838/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>The divide between PC and console gaming isn’t what it once was. Heck, in a world where <i>Gears of War</i> and <a href="https://kotaku.com/halo-1-remake-combat-evolved-trailer-hwc-teaser-xbox-ps5-2000638911"><i>Halo</i> are on PlayStation</a>, the divide between console platforms isn’t even what it once was. And according to the CEO of <i>GTA 6</i>’s publisher, Take-Two, PC gaming is only going to grow.</p> <p>Speaking to CNBC (<a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/take-two-boss-says-gaming-is-moving-towards-pc-but-gta-6-is-still-down-for-ps5-and-xbox-series-x-and-s-at-launch">h/t <i>IGN</i></a>), Take-Two’s CEO Strauss Zelnick said he sees the industry “moving towards PC,” as things become “open rather than closed.” He’s not completely writing off consoles, however, saying that the experience of sitting in front of a big screen for hours on end with a game is “never going away.”</p>

 <p>Given the current landscape, Zelnick’s comments ring true. Console exclusives are somewhat of an endangered species these days, with Microsoft publishing Xbox titles on its competitor’s platforms, the Switch 2 proving powerful enough to run titles like <i>Cyberpunk 2077</i> on the go, Sony publishing once PlayStation-only experiences on Steam, and, naturally, devices like the Steam Deck and the upcoming Steam Machine breaking down the boundaries that once restricted where and how we could play PC games.</p>

 <h2>How will the Steam Machine shake things up for console gaming?</h2> <p>Last week, <a href="https://kotaku.com/16-cool-details-valve-new-steam-machine-console-controller-vr-headset-2000643572">Valve showed off its impressive new hardware lineup</a>, including a new VR headset, a brand new Steam controller, and a cube-shaped mini-PC it calls the Steam Machine. Valve previously worked with PC hardware manufacturers to ship <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steam_Machine_(computer)">Steam Machines 10 years ago</a>, though they failed to catch on. But now that the company has dramatically improved the experience of SteamOS and the magic of running Windows games on a Linux operating system, if priced competitively, the new Steam Machine could become a pathway to having the kinds of “big screen” experiences Zelnick talks about with PC games.</p>

 <p>Speaking for myself, if the <a href="https://kotaku.com/steam-machine-controller-steamos-reaction-price-date-2000643563">Steam Machine proves as awesome as it sounds</a>, I could see myself holing up in a cabin somewhere (with an internet connection!) to finish my entire Steam backlog without an Xbox or PlayStation in sight.</p> <p>I jest, but only slightly. As PCs continue to explore new form factors and Steam and other storefronts remain a reliable way to build and maintain a digital library, I don’t think it’s unreasonable to expect a slow and steady exodus from locked-in console experiences.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/gamestop-trade-in-anything-day-rules-2000645098</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/gamestop-employees-are-freaking-out-about-%E2%80%98trade-anything-day%E2%80%99-%E2%80%98god-help-us%E2%80%99.1356832/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><span>Earlier this week, meme stock retailer turned Pok</span><span>é</span><span>mon card pawn shop, GameStop, announced a new trade-in stunt engineered to go viral. “<a href="https://kotaku.com/gamestop-trade-anything-taxidermy-store-credit-2000644850">Trade Anything Day</a>” will let customers come in and hand over almost anything in exchange for store credit. Employees who weren’t told about the promotional stunt in advance are already preparing for the worst. Some are even trying to harness the chaos for a good cause.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>GameStop’s official announcement says people can bring in their junk and trade it in on December 6 for credit toward games and other purchases as long as it doesn’t violate a long list of exceptions. Those include hazardous materials, things that pose health risks, and Meta Quest VR headsets, for some reason. Trade-ins for stuff the stores normally accept will continue as usual.</span></p>

 <p><span>But that’s not the whole story. A flyer </span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GameStop/comments/1ozzats/trade_anything_promotion_information/"><span>store employees received</span></a><span> goes into more detail and explains exactly how “Trade Anything Day”is supposed to work. Customers can only trade in one nonsense item that day. They only get $5 store credit, no matter what it is. At the very end, employees will be tasked with taking all of the qualifying items to local, approved donation drop-off points. Presumably everything else will be thrown out.&nbsp;</span></p>

   <p><span>“We’re getting so many calls already and people are being extra people-y already because they aren’t reading the rules,” one current employee told </span><i><span>Kotaku</span></i><span>. “The problem has been lately that they drop this stuff on socials and we find out hours or days later.”</span></p>

 <p><span>Other GameStop workers are already crashing out. “God help us,” reads </span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GameStop/comments/1ozy57j/god_help_us/"><span>one thread</span></a><span> on the r/gamestop subreddit. “I’m not prepared for the ‘bring anything to trade’ day. I just know I’m going to have to handle some nasty shit. And not only that, we’re probably going to have to reject some of the things because they’re a biological hazard. I’m gonna have so many customers asking me ‘HoW cOmE yOu CaN’t TaKe iT iN?’ Cause we can’t bro.”</span></p>

 <p><span>The fact that all of the trade-ins have to be donated or thrown out has already inspired some stores to try and coax their customers into trading in canned goods and other non-perishables or toys that can be used for holiday gift drive charities. For some reason, GameStop isn’t advertising that part of the promotion. Instead it’s making jokes about trading in taxidermy animals.</span></p>

 <p><span>“A store next door to mine has a Toys for Tots bin, so we’re going to push for toys,” an employee told </span><i><span>Kotaku</span></i><span>. “A co-worker’s church is doing a coat and sweater drive so we’ll push for that. And we’ve talked to a couple of our regular Pok</span><span>é</span><span>mon collectors about bringing in a five-ish dollar card to join the collection of cards we give to kids who come in at my store and can’t get packs [because of scalpers].”</span></p> <p><span>They’re hoping this can add a silver lining to what otherwise promises to be a messy day. While GameStop is infamous for its poor trade-in values, store employees are also used to dealing with unreasonable customers expecting top dollar for last year’s </span><i><span>Madden</span></i><span>. I can only guess how it will go when they try to bring in a cardboard box of moldy junk and only get $5 off of </span><i><span>Kriby Air Riders</span></i><span> for it.&nbsp;</span></p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/asus-rog-strix-g16-ryzen-9-rtx-5070-1tb-drops-to-peanuts-amazon-offloads-2025-model-stock.1356829/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Gaming laptops require serious hardware in order to run modern titles at high settings without thermal throttling or performance compromises during extended sessions. The <strong>Asus ROG Strix G16</strong> (2025 edition) packs flagship-tier components into a portable package, and it is <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5674/">now $1,699 down from the usual $2,199 price tag.</a></p>
<p>That’s a <strong>record low for Black Friday on Amazon</strong> and it feels aggressive; after all, this is a 2025 model that just launched earlier this year. You’re getting an AMD Ryzen 9 9955HX processor paired with an Nvidia GeForce RTX 5070 laptop GPU, 32GB of DDR5-5600 RAM, and a 1TB PCIe Gen 4 SSD.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5674/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Ryzen 9 9955HX and RTX 5070 Blackwell Architecture</h2>
<p>The <strong>Ryzen 9 9955HX is AMD’s newest high-performance mobile processor,</strong> boasting <strong>16 cores and 32 threads on the Zen 5 architecture</strong>. The base clock sits at 2.5GHz, while boost speeds go as high as 5.4GHz on single-threaded workloads for serious processing power in gaming, streaming, and content creation. It can also handle background tasks like Discord, multiple browser tabs, and streaming software without negatively impacting the actual performance of your game.</p>
<p>In the RTX 5070, t<strong>he new Blackwell architecture from Nvidia</strong>, the DLSS 4 support, and the Max-Q power optimization all come into play. DLSS 4 generates additional frames using AI processing, effectively doubling or tripling frame rates in supported games without quality loss. Ray tracing performance sees considerable improvements over previous 40-series cards, enabling ray-traced reflections and lighting without framerates penalties that made earlier generations impractical to use. The 8 GB of GDDR6 VRAM can handle 1440p gaming comfortably with high to ultra settings in current AAA titles.</p>



<p>The<strong> DDR5-5600 RAM is available in a 32GB capacity</strong> across dual channels, providing plenty of bandwidth for memory-intensive games and applications. This speed grade is a major leap from DDR4, which reduces latency in CPU-bound scenarios and improves minimum frame rates when things get really intense during gameplay. The 1TB PCIe Gen 4 SSD hits sequential read speeds of about 7,000 MB/s, which cuts game load times to just seconds instead of minutes.</p>



<p>The<strong> 16-inch ROG Nebula display runs at 2560 x 1600 resolution</strong> and has a 16:10 aspect ratio for more vertical screen real estate than is provided by standard 16:9 panels. The extra vertical pixels help with productivity work like coding or document editing, while gaming benefits remain minimal. The 240Hz refresh rate with 3ms response time creates incredibly responsive gameplay in competitive shooters and fast-paced action games.</p>
<p>The Tri-Fan cooling system consists of three separate fans, each connected to a full-width <strong>heatsink and leading air out through comprehensive venting coverage around the perimeter of the chassis</strong>. The aggressive setup here keeps temperatures comfortable even in hours-long gaming marathons with demanding titles. Fan noise stays reasonable at moderate levels of performance, only spiking audibly loud when pushing maximum GPU and CPU loads simultaneously. Liquid metal thermal compound on the CPU improves the efficiency of heat transfer compared to traditional thermal paste, and it drops temperatures by several degrees under load.</p>



<p>WiFi 6E support accesses the newer 6GHz band for reduced interference and lower latency compared to standard WiFi 6. Bluetooth 5.3 handles wireless peripherals with improved range and connection stability. The port selection houses <strong>dual USB-C with DisplayPort functionality, three USB-A 3.2 ports, HDMI 2.1 for 4K external displays, an SD card reader, and a 3.5mm audio jack</strong>.</p>
<p>Windows 11 Home pre-installs ROG’s Armoury Crate software for performance tuning, fan curves, RGB control, and system monitoring. Battery capacity hits 90Wh, providing roughly 4 to 6 hours during light productivity work and 1 to 2 hours when gaming unplugged. The included 280W power adapter handles the maximum system draw during peak performance scenarios.</p>
<p>You’re getting here current-generation flagship components for 23% below retail pricing on a laptop that only launched months ago. By comparison, competing gaming laptops from MSI and Alienware with similar RTX 5070 specs usually fall between $2,200 and $2,600.</p>

              <p>With sports titles be they Madden, FIFA, or NBA 2K, because we get a new entry each year, the value of a previous year’s entry drop dramatically once the new one comes out. So you can typically save quite a bit of cash by keeping up with the franchise on a one year delay as the price comes down. Though that comes with the caveat of never having up to date rosters and staying a year behind on any new changes to the series. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5666/">That changes right now though because the latest entry for basketball in&nbsp;<em>NBA 2K26</em> has dropped to just $30 at Amazon</a>. This is a 57% discount from its launch price of $70, saving you a whole $40 before our calendar’s have even reached the year that’s in the dang title.</p>
<p>As you can expect, the latest in this annual sports titles looks the best the series ever has — looking even better than the year’s before this one, which looked even better than the year’s before that one.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5666/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<p>Any improvements to the gameplay are incremental as this series is built on a long legacy with just a single year turnaround before needing to put out the next one. If you pick up the latest NBA 2K each year, you’ll notice these changes. Among them is a updated shot meter. <em>NBA 2K25</em>‘s shot meter was met with criticism, the new one isn’t exactly a return to form but represents a much more intuitive and easier-to-time mechanic than the previous entry.</p>

              <p>There’s been a lot of exciting news from Valve in this past week with the company’s announcement of brand new hardware including a new controller, new VR peripherals, and a new home gaming console. What paved the way for the Steam Controller, Steam Frame, sand Steam Machine is of course the success of Valve’s handheld gaming PC — the Steam Deck. Valve has given gamers a great new way to experience every game on their platform on the go with the Steam Deck, but if you want to play more and more stuff, you’re going to want to expand your storage.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5662/">Amazon right now happens to have the Crucial P310 SSD on sale.</a> Black Friday weekend is still almost two full weeks away, but that hasn’t stopped the price of this Steam Deck gaming drive from dropping by as much as 46%. Right now, you can get the 1TB version on sale for $50, bringing the price down from $135 to just $85. For even more storage, you can also grab the 2TB version for $110 off, bringing the price down from $240 to just $130.</p>

              <p>What’s better than grabbing a reliable, powerful everyday machine that even comes with Windows 11 Pro installed, for under a grand? Probably not much.</p>
<p>If you have been looking for such a machine from a known brand, now is the time to make the move. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5661/">Amazon has currently dropped the price of the 15-inch Dell Inspiron touchscreen laptop to $960, which is a straightforward, no-fuss 70% discount on its retail price of over $3,000.</a> This is also the lowest price we have seen this laptop go for in a month, but the offer doesn’t end here.</p>
<p>The retailer is also throwing in a bunch of useful computing accessories with your purchase for absolutely nothing. The 5-in-1 kit is worth almost $200, but grabbing the laptop gets you that for free. Of course, deals this good don’t stick around for long, which is why we highly recommend getting your orders in fast. Once it’s gone, there’s no telling if it’ll return for Black Friday or if it’ll still be in stock by then.</p>

<h2>Ideal for Both Students and Work Professionals</h2>
<p>This machine looks quite basic, but it packs serious performance for both work and play. The overall design is quite minimal, and features a modest 15.6-inch touchscreen that pushes stunning visuals for all your tasks. The anti-glare coating makes it easy on the eyes in both bright and dim settings, so whether you’re working in daylight or tackling tasks late at night, you won’t be straining to see the screen.</p>
<p>Touch support makes it easier to navigate. You can simply use your fingers to scroll through long documents, swipe around, pinch, and even type assigments; great for when you don’t want to bother with the trackpad or the mouse.</p>



<p>For performance, you’ve got a 10-core 13th Gen Intel Core i7-1355U processor that clocks up to 5.0GHz, paired with a hefty 32GB of RAM. Together, these make it easy to perform all your tasks with ease, without even a hint of lag. Store all your important files with the spacious 1TB SSD, which also offers faster boot and load times than traditional drives.</p>
<p>Connectivity options include WiFi, Bluetooth, plus a wide range of ports to connect essential devices. <strong>The accessory kit gets you a patented mouse, a USB Hub, a 128GB USB flash drive, a 7-in-1 cleaning kit, and pre-installed Windows 11 Pro.</strong> That’s all you need to get started right away!</p>
