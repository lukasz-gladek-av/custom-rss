            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Apple’s official 20W USB-C charger costs $20 and doesn’t even include a cable, forcing iPhone buyers to pay extra just to charge their new devices at proper speeds. Anker has positioned itself as one of the few third-party brands sold directly in Apple Stores and it earned Apple’s stamp of approval for quality and compatibility.</p>
<p>The good news is that right now, this <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3718/">two-pack of Anker 20W chargers currently sells for just $15 on Amazon, down from the standard $18 price</a>, and each unit includes a 5-foot USB-C cable. You’re essentially <strong>getting two complete charging solutions</strong> with cables for less than the cost of Apple’s single charger alone.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3718/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>



<h2>Why Anker Earned Apple’s Trust and Your Money</h2>
<p>The <strong>20W output provides the fastest charging speed currently supported by iPhones</strong> which brings an empty device to about 50% in roughly 30 minutes. That’s really fast and something important for those rushed mornings when you forgot to charge overnight or need to top up before going out in the evening. Power Delivery ensures compatibility across the entire iPhone lineup from the iPhone 8 forward and it will work seamlessly with iPads that support fast charging, AirPods cases, and various other USB-C devices.</p>



<p>But that’s not all: the <strong>dual-port design on each charger</strong> brings with it some unexpected versatility that Apple’s single-port adapter simply can’t match. You <strong>get both a USB-C port and a USB-A port on each unit</strong>, and lets you charge two devices at the same time without needing multiple wall outlets. If you’re using the USB-C alone, it’ll continue to pump out the full 20W while the USB-A adds additional charging capability for any older devices or accessories that haven’t yet made the switch to USB-C.</p>



<p>That compact form factor makes these chargers truly portable without the bulk that seems to afflict too many high-wattage adapters. The<strong> foldable prongs on the US version fold flat against the body</strong> so the sharp metal pins won’t catch on clothes or scratch other items in your bag. The size is small enough to fit in crowded power strips without blocking the adjacent outlets, which addresses one of the most annoying things about big charging bricks: they tend to monopolize multiple spaces.</p>
<p>The<strong> included 5-foot-long USB-C to USB-C cables</strong> provide you with enough length to comfortably use your phone as it charges, even when the outlet is located inconveniently. Apple’s own cables are only 3 feet, which in turn makes you sit strangely close to wall outlets or sacrifice active use of your phone during charging. The extra two feet of cable length completely alters charging from a restrictive tether into something that allows natural movement and comfortable usage of the device.</p>
<p>For $15 for two charging solutions with cables included, this <strong>Anker pack is 75% less than buying two of Apple’s official chargers</strong> that would run you $40 plus the additional cost of cables.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/dont-bother-with-windows-mini-pcs-apples-mac-mini-goes-for-peanuts-and-beats-them-all-2000642438</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/don%E2%80%99t-bother-with-windows-mini-pcs-apple%E2%80%99s-mac-mini-goes-for-peanuts-and-beats-them-all.1348999/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Compact desktop computers promise space-saving convenience but too many Windows-based mini PCs struggle with performance compromises that undermine their appeal. Apple’s latest Mac mini with M4 chip demolishes that equation entirely as this small computer delivers performance that embarrasses even high-spec Windows alternatives while occupying minimal desk space.</p>
<p>Currently<a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4124/"> available for just $499 on Amazon for the 256GB option, down from its standard $599 price</a>, this is the lowest price this latest-generation Mac mini has ever reached. This early Black Friday deal makes Apple’s most affordable desktop even more accessible, and given how thoroughly the M4 chip outperforms competing mini PCs, choosing this over Windows alternatives becomes an obvious decision.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4124/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>



<h2>Why the M4 Chip Changes Everything for Desktop Computing</h2>
<p>The 10-core CPU inside this Mac mini delivers <strong>processing power that rivals desktop towers costing significantly more</strong>. Apple’s ARM-based architecture realizes efficiency that x86 processors simply can’t match and translates raw performance into real-world speed across every task you throw at it. The 10-core GPU covers graphics from casual gaming to 3D rendering, processing visual information via dedicated hardware that integrated graphics in Windows mini PCs can’t approach.</p>



<p>The 16GB of unified memory is a core advantage of <strong>Apple Silicon over traditional RAM configurations</strong>. Essentially, Unified Memory allows the CPU, GPU, and neural engine to access the same pool of memory without copying data across different banks, which eliminates bottlenecks that slow down Windows systems with discrete components. The unified approach lets Apple include features like Apple Intelligence, which taps into on-device machine learning to improve everything from photo editing to voice recognition without shipping your data off to cloud servers.</p>



<p>The connectivity options packed into this small enclosure exceed what many full-size desktops offer: You get multiple Thunderbolt 4 ports capable of transferring data at 40Gbps, connecting high-resolution screens up to 6K resolution and daisy-chaining multiple devices through a single connection. The HDMI port supports connecting a second display without requiring adapters while USB-A ports accommodate those older peripherals that haven’t transitioned to USB-C yet. Gigabit Ethernet provides wired network speeds that blow away WiFi reliability for tasks such as large file transfers or video streaming, and the WiFi 6E wireless connectivity ensures fast performance when cables aren’t practical.</p>
<p>The Apple Intelligence integration is the future of computing, putting AI at your fingertips without reliance on the cloud. Local processing by the neural engine in the M4 enables advanced photo search features to recognize objects and scenes, voice transcription on the fly without requiring internet connectivity, and smart suggestions across apps that provide context based on your usage patterns.</p>
<p><strong>Measuring just 5 x 5 inches</strong>, this compact construction occupies less desk space than a large coffee mug, while the performance would make full-sized towers envious. That minimal footprint makes this Mac mini perfect for small apartments, dorm rooms, or minimalist workspaces where every inch of desk real estate counts. Made from aluminum, it provides strong durability and allows heat dissipation while keeping the system running quietly even under high workload conditions.</p>
<p>At $499, this Mac mini delivers flagship performance at midrange pricing and makes Apple’s desktop computing accessible to buyers who previously found Mac hardware too expensive. This $100 discount is real savings on a machine that will serve reliably for years, supported by Apple’s legendary build quality and macOS’s stability.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Good morning and welcome back to yet another Monday. I’m so sorry. I don’t control the days of the week. But I do control this post, and so I can say: I’m rooting for you. Anyway, welcome back to Morning Checkpoint, <em>Kotaku’s</em> daily round-up of news and other stuff you might care about. Today, we take a peek at a controller leak, get some advice from a veteran game maker, and hear what Hideo Kojima thought of <em>Predator: Badlands</em></p>

 <h2>The new Steam Controller looks big and chonky</h2> <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">The new Steam Controller will look like this when it launches</p> <p>Im told that it can also detect how far your hands are from the handles using a simple capsense feature</p> <p>Similar to the index controllers, but not full finger tracking in the grips <a href="https://t.co/loIqpJb0YZ">pic.twitter.com/loIqpJb0YZ</a></p> <p>— Brad Lynch (@SadlyItsBradley) <a href="https://twitter.com/SadlyItsBradley/status/1987644108765380813?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 9, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <p>Fans of the Xbox Duke controller will likely be happy to hear that Valve’s next Steam Controller will reportedly be similarly large and in charge. <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GamingLeaksAndRumours/comments/1osxuwk/sadlyitsbradley_the_new_steam_controller_will/">On Sunday, reliable Valve insider Brad Lynch shared an AI-generated image</a> of what the not-yet-officially-announced new Steam controller will look like. And yeah, it’s big, complete with two touch pads, like the Steam Deck, and even does some basic finger tracking. Leaks and info about this controller and other Valve hardware keep happening, and rumors are swirling that a reveal of something from the company is coming soon.</p>

 <h2><strong><em>Modern Warfare 2 Remastered</em> likely coming to Game Pass soon</strong></h2> <p>2020’s <em>Call of Duty Modern Warfare 2: Campaign Remastered</em> will likely be added to Xbox’s Game Pass service, according to a leaked ad that was spotted by fans. It’s hard to make out, but it does seem like <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/XboxGamePass/comments/1ory64g/mw2_coming_to_game_pass/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button"><em>Modern Warfare 2′</em>s cover art is included in a dashboard ad</a> that appeared on one player’s screen. It’s possible this was just a mistake, but Xbox and Activision have been regularly adding <a href="https://kotaku.com/game-pass-call-of-duty-modern-warfare-3-mw3-july-xbox-1851601479">old<em> Call of Duty</em> games to Game Pass since 2024.</a></p>

 <h2><strong><em>Mega Man</em> designer Keiji Inafune wants devs to stop clinging to the past</strong></h2> <p><a href="https://www.thisisgame.com/articles/406514">Over the weekend, as reported by<em> This Is Game,</em></a> <em>Mega Man</em> character designer and <a href="https://kotaku.com/mega-mans-creator-quits-capcom-update-5676403">former Capcom producer Keiji Inafune</a> appeared at the Console Game Developer Conference in South Korea and advised attendees not to rely solely on sequels and established franchises.</p>

 <p>“To be clear, it’s not that games that continue a series or build off an existing famous genre are bad,” said Inafune via Google Translation. “What I mean is that <em>only</em>&nbsp;that is not enough.”</p> <p>“If you make a hit, yes, you’ve succeeded, but it can also place a tremendous burden on you. Does success always seem like a good thing? It is good. You can’t succeed when you’re in a state of anxiety. You need confidence, and that confidence requires a foundation. A past success can provide that foundation. But few people who succeed once go on to succeed again. Success brings positive effects, but it also brings side effects. I’ve seen many people who cling only to past success. They cling to how things were done at that time and adopt a defensive attitude.”</p>

 <p>“In the games industry, many people have succeeded once and that’s it, haven’t they? How often did their sequels succeed too?” asked the veteran developer. “I don’t want to boast, but I take pride in having many representative works – not just <em>Mega Man</em>, but <em>Lost Planet,</em> <em>Onimusha</em>,<em> Dead Rising,</em> and so on. The genres were diverse, too. Because I didn’t rest on past successes.”</p>

 <h2><b>Kojima suffered through a back injury to watch the new <em>Predator</em> movie</b></h2> <p>Hideo Kojima has seen the new <em>Predator</em> movie and <a href="https://x.com/HIDEO_KOJIMA_EN/status/1987437583430045778">really liked it, despite a painful back injury</a>. Thankfully, Kojima brought a “secret weapon” to the theater: an inflatable lumbar pillow.</p> <p>“[<em>Predator: Badlands</em>] represents a new direction for Hollywood entertainment led by a new generation of filmmakers who have inherited the global ‘memes’ of manga, anime, and gaming culture,” said Kojima on Sunday. “I especially hope young anime fans who usually steer clear of live-action Western films will give this one a try. Even with Dek’s ‘ugly’ face, you’ll find yourself emotionally invested from the opening scene. You’ll definitely get hooked.”</p> <h2>ICYMI:</h2> <ul> <li><a href="https://kotaku.com/arc-raiders-review-extraction-loot-shooter-embark-2000642198"><strong>Check out our excellent review of <em>Arc Raiders</em></strong></a></li> <li><a href="https://kotaku.com/halo-infinite-no-more-updates-operation-halo-studios-xbox-2000642195"><strong><em>Halo Infinite</em> is officially going on life support</strong></a></li> <li><a href="https://kotaku.com/ball-x-pit-vampire-survivors-balatro-roguelike-2000642155"><strong><em>Ball x Pit</em> creator thinks y’all are being too nice</strong></a></li> </ul> <h2>Watch This:</h2>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/lego-unloads-the-grogu-with-hover-pram-set-now-selling-the-star-wars-bundle-for-pennies-on-amazon-only-2000642399</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Star Wars collectibles rarely go on sale, especially character-driven sets like this one that often remain desirable well after their initial release. But right now, the LEGO <strong>Star Wars Grogu with Hover Pram</strong> set is bucking that trend, <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5425/">selling for an all-time low of just $62 on Amazon (down from its typical $99).</a> This buildable display model <strong>includes 1,048 pieces</strong> and almost never gets discounted, which makes this 37% off sale a really exceptional offer. LEGO’s website still sells the set at retail price, so Amazon’s deal is far and away the best way to get this Mandalorian merchandise without having to pay premium collector prices.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5425/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>



<h2>Mandalorian Magic</h2>
<p>The engineering behind this buildable figure shows just why LEGO can command premium prices in the first place.<strong> Grogu’s arms move through dial-operated mechanisms</strong> buried within the body, in a manner that allows you to pose those small hands into gestures that capture both the innocent curiosity and mischievousness of the character.</p>
<p>The head rotates smoothly through an entire range of motion while the oversized ears articulate independently, yielding a wide range of expressions and moods. These parts turn what is otherwise a display model right into an interactive one, whereby one is able to change Grogu’s pose to their favorite scenes from The Mandalorian or create entirely new moments. The level of detail extends to a subtle texture in the robe, facial features that genuinely look like the on-screen character, and proportions that manage to feel accurate despite being constructed completely out of rectangular plastic bricks.</p>



<p>The hover pram itself is more than just a figure base, with its spherical design accurately depicting the protective pod that Grogu rides around in throughout the series. Opening panels showcase the interior space where the Child sits, and you can display Grogu inside with the canopy closed for that iconic traveling look or open everything up to show off the figure a bit better. It’s got a stand to provide stable support while still keeping up the illusion of hovering for a dynamic display that looks more interesting than figures on flat bases.</p>



<p>Accessories add a lot of storytelling possibility to increase the appeal of this display. The brick-built Sorgan frog references the memorable episode where Grogu hunted local wildlife despite Mando’s disapproval, and you can position it in Grogu’s hand as if he’s about to enjoy a crunchy snack. The shifter knob from the Razor Crest cockpit represents one of Grogu’s favorite toys throughout the series-a simple object which the Child finds endlessly fascinating. The cookie is another food accessory that captures Grogu’s constant appetite and childlike enthusiasm for treats.</p>
<p>The<strong> 1,048-piece count is that sweet middle ground</strong> where the building process remains engaging without being tedious. You’ll be able to work through the construction in several hours and find that meditative flow state that makes LEGO building so appealing for adults as a means of screen-free relaxation. The building techniques range from simple stacking for structural elements to smart solutions for curved surfaces and mechanical linkages.</p>
<p>With <strong>hundreds of reviewers giving it 4.9 out of 5 star</strong>s, there’s confirmation that it certainly does deliver on its promise.&nbsp;At $62, this is the lowest price this set has ever reached and puts it within the budget of a fanbase that might have found a $99 retail price harder to justify.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/dont-buy-your-ipad-at-an-apple-store-amazon-just-dropped-the-base-wifi-model-to-pocket-change-2000642394</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/don%E2%80%99t-buy-your-ipad-at-an-apple-store-amazon-just-dropped-the-base-wifi-model-to-pocket-change.1348903/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Tablets have become essential tools for everything from streaming shows to taking notes in meetings but finding one that delivers premium performance without premium pricing remains a challenge. Apple dominates the tablet market because of the tight ecosystem integration and refined hardware; the 11-inch iPad with the A16 chip is the most affordable entry point into that experience. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4533/">Currently priced at $299 on Amazon after its standard $349 retail price, this 2025 WiFi 128GB model</a> delivers the core iPad experience at the lowest this configuration has ever reached<strong>. Apple’s own website still sells this exact model at full price</strong>, which makes Amazon’s discount genuinely noteworthy.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4533/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>



<h2>The Sweet Spot for Most Users</h2>
<p>The A16 chip powering this iPad comes straight from Apple’s iPhone lineage and brings smartphone-class efficiency and processing power to tablet computing. This processor nudges along multiple running apps with ease: You seamlessly flip between Safari tabs, respond to messages, edit photos, and stream video without the sluggish performance that plagues cheaper Android tablets. The neural engine within the A16 Bionic greatly accelerates machine learning tasks, including photo recognition, voice processing and augmented reality applications.</p>



<p>The 11-inch Liquid Retina display strikes an ideal balance between portability and usable screen space. The 2360 x 1640 resolution delivers sharp text that remains readable even at smaller font sizes, making this iPad viable for extended reading sessions or document work. <strong>True Tone technology automatically adjusts the color temperature in the display based on the surrounding light</strong>&nbsp;and reduces eye strain when you move from bright outdoor environments into warm indoor lighting.</p>
<p>The <strong>camera system is actually far better than what most would expect from tablet cameras</strong>: The 12MP rear camera captures surprisingly good photos and 4K video, making this iPad capable of documenting events, scanning documents, or recording video content when your phone isn’t handy. The front 12MP camera, finally situated in a landscape orientation, puts the lens where it should be for video calls, centering you in frame when the iPad sits naturally on a desk or in a stand.</p>



<p>The 128GB of storage handles normal use patterns without requiring constant file management. You can have a good library of Netflix shows downloaded for offline viewing, store thousands of photos, install dozens of apps, and keep important documents locally accessible. Of course, cloud storage integration through iCloud allows you to easily expand beyond local storage for files you don’t need immediate access to. Having 128GB on board eliminates the anxiety that comes with 64GB models, which fill up frustratingly fast. This capacity hits that sweet spot whereby most users never feel constrained but aren’t paying extra for storage they’ll never use.</p>
<p>WiFi 6 connectivity itself offers faster wireless speeds and better performance in crowded networks compared with older WiFi standards which makes a noticeable difference when you download large files, stream high-resolution video, or use the iPad in environments with many competing devices on the same network. Furthermore, the increased efficiency means better battery life on network-intensive tasks as the WiFi 6 radio can transmit data faster and return to low-power states more quickly.</p>
<p><strong>The iPad is better integrated into the ecosystem of Apple devices</strong>, and creates great continuity between them. You can start typing something in an email on your iPad and then just finish it on your iPhone or Mac. Or copy text or an image on one and paste it into another using Universal Clipboard, start something on one device and pick it up where you left off with Handoff. It works so transparently that you stop thinking about which device you’re using and focus instead on what you’re trying to accomplish.</p>
<p>A rating of <strong>4.8 out of 5 stars based on over 12,000 reviews</strong> shows real end-user satisfaction in this iPad’s performance and reliability. That feedback comes from real buyers who use the device daily, providing confidence that the experience matches Apple’s promises.</p>
<p>At $299, this is Apple’s most accessible premium tablet offering to date, and bringss the iPad experience within reach of buyers who previously considered it too expensive.</p>
