The raid happened on April 15, and police allegedly even took the YouTuber’s personal phone and didn’t return it until June. <br></p><p>According to Salicini’s video explaining the entire situation, law enforcement in Italy is apparently not required to disclose what he is being charged with or who specifically brought the charges against him until the initial investigation is finished. At that point, a judge would decide to dismiss the case or take it to trial.</p><p><em>Kotaku</em> has reached out to Salicini about his legal issues. </p><p> The complaint Salicini received from Guardia di Finanza cites him violating Article 171ter of Italian Copyright Law. That same complaint also lists Sony and Nintendo, but it’s possible that Italy’s Ministry of Economy and Finance was responsible for bringing forward the charges against the YouTuber. Salicini believes this is because he has reviewed retro handhelds from companies like Anbernic, which sometimes come pre-loaded with classic game ROMs. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/nintendo-valve-pc-dolphin-emulator-piracy-copyright-1850658946&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/nintendo-valve-pc-dolphin-emulator-piracy-copyright-1850658946">While emulation is legal</a></span>, ROMs exist in a weird, murky grey area.<br></p><p> The law that Salicini might have violated was written in 1941 and comes with a maximum punishment of €15,000 and up to three years of jail time. </p><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.gofundme.com/f/un-aiuto-per-chi-vorra-e-potra-ad-un-semplice-nerd-onesto&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.gofundme.com/f/un-aiuto-per-chi-vorra-e-potra-ad-un-semplice-nerd-onesto" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Salicini has started a GoFundMe to help cover his legal fees</a></span>.

It ain’t an easy task, as over 20 million games of <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/magnus-carlsen-jeans-chess-blitz-championship-fide-1851730179&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/magnus-carlsen-jeans-chess-blitz-championship-fide-1851730179">chess</a></span> are played on the platform every single day. But the team has gotten pretty good at detecting cheaters and banning their accounts. </p><p>One interesting stat that Chess.com’s Fair Play team shared in the blog post is that nearly 40 percent of closed accounts are less than two weeks old. This means the team’s methods of finding and punishing naughty players and bots are doing a solid job of catching cheaters early. But Chess.com thinks it can do an even better job at keeping cheaters out. </p><p>“One of the ways we’re tackling this phenomenon is by screening players more frequently early in their journey on the platform,” said Chess.com’s Fair Play team. “This means we’re generating reports for players that essentially serve as checkpoints as they play more games. It is entirely reasonable (and expected) that it may take time for someone to establish their rating, so these checkpoints go beyond games played and rating earned, but also include strength of play and over 100 other gameplay factors.”</p><p>The team also shared that it uses algorithms to look out for extraordinary examples of cheating or inhuman behavior. With only 30 people watching and 20 million games a day, it makes sense that the team would need extra help. All of this is in service of making sure most players who hop onto Chess.com have a good time.

Now this storyline and Malkovich’s performance have been cut from the final film.</p><p>“It was heartbreaking not to include him in the final version of the movie because he’s one of my very favorite humans and one of my biggest inspirations,” Shakman said. “As a person who walks the line between theater and film and television, there’s no one who is more inspiring than the founder of Steppenwolf Theater Company. What he’s done on stage as an actor and what he’s done as a director in theater as well as in film, and as just a film actor of incredible ability — I was honored he came to play.”</p><p>Maybe we’ll see this cut segment in a director’s cut or special features when the movie ends up on streaming. It’s also entirely possible Red Ghost appears in a future MCU movie. It would be a shame to have an actor of Malkovich’s caliber and just waste him on deleted scenes. <em>Fantastic Four: First Steps </em><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/fantastic-4-first-steps-pedro-pascal-mr-fantastic-reed-1851786015&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/fantastic-4-first-steps-pedro-pascal-mr-fantastic-reed-1851786015">comes to theaters on July 25</a></span>.</p></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://kotaku.com/fantastic-four-first-steps-john-malkovich-red-ghost-cut-1851786444]]></content:encoded>
