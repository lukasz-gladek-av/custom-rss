After years of promising that such a pipeline had arrived, it might finally, actually be the  case. </p><p>Here’s how the release calendar for Game Pass Ultimate day-and-date games is shaping up in 2025 (remember, you need the <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/xbox-game-pass-price-increase-standard-console-ultimate-1851583866&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/xbox-game-pass-price-increase-standard-console-ultimate-1851583866">more expensive membership</a></span> to access the games at release, unless you’re on PC):</p><blockquote data-type="BlockQuote"><ul data-type="List" data-style="Bullet"><li><strong><em>Lonely Mountain: Snow Riders </em></strong>–  January 21</li><li><strong><em>Ninja Gaiden 2 Black</em>&nbsp;</strong>– January 23</li><li><strong><em>Eternal Strands</em>&nbsp;</strong>– January 28 </li><li><strong><em>Orcs Must Die!

And that’s before factoring in games with release dates that haven’t been announced yet and games we already know are coming but whose Game Pass deals are still secret. We have no idea if <em>Hollow Knight: Silksong</em> <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/hollow-knight-silksong-announcement-team-cherry-1851743081?_gl=1*nrvzc*_ga*MzQzNjkwNDM2LjE2NDY2NjQ1NzQ.*_ga_V4QNJTT5L0*MTczNzY2NzAyNS4zMTkuMS4xNzM3NjY3NjA4LjYwLjAuMA..&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/hollow-knight-silksong-announcement-team-cherry-1851743081?_gl=1*nrvzc*_ga*MzQzNjkwNDM2LjE2NDY2NjQ1NzQ.*_ga_V4QNJTT5L0*MTczNzY2NzAyNS4zMTkuMS4xNzM3NjY3NjA4LjYwLjAuMA..">will finally hit sometime in 2025, for example</a></span>, but if it does, it’s already been promised as a day-one Game Pass release. </p><p>Last year, after Microsoft’s latest price hike and the move to drop day-one games from the base subscription tier, I wrote about how <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/xbox-game-pass-price-cod-blops-6-day-one-1851585059?_gl=1*1v2sqgy*_ga*ODE3ODM5ODIyLjE3MjA0NjY0NTg.*_ga_V4QNJTT5L0*MTczNzY1OTgwNi4yMS4xLjE3Mzc2NjY1NzMuMjcuMC4w&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/xbox-game-pass-price-cod-blops-6-day-one-1851585059?_gl=1*1v2sqgy*_ga*ODE3ODM5ODIyLjE3MjA0NjY0NTg.*_ga_V4QNJTT5L0*MTczNzY1OTgwNi4yMS4xLjE3Mzc2NjY1NzMuMjcuMC4w">Game Pass was a deal that just keeps getting worse</a></span>. Maybe 2025 is the year Microsoft reverses that trend by delivering quality and consistency thanks to its massive new publishing apparatus, alongside the development timeline for games this generation finally bearing fruit. Who knows if that means Microsoft can keep this trend up, or if this will turn out to be a spectacular but isolated blip as the bill for an unsustainable economic model comes due?</p><p>In the meantime, at least, Game Pass Ultimate and PC subscribers are about to get swamped with  a bunch of (hopefully) cool new games.</p><p>.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

But according to the devs, they wanted to make a bigger, better game, and cutting multiplayer let them do that. </p><p>“There’s only the campaign, and we decided that from the beginning,” said Stratton. “We wanted to free ourselves to create experiences like the mech and the dragon. Those are both like their own mini-games in the game. We decided to put all our effort into creating the biggest and best campaign we’ve ever made.”</p><p>Martin added: “We didn’t do multiplayer so that we could make a better single-player game. Like, we couldn’t have done the mech and the dragon and all that other stuff if we spread the resources around different game pillars, so we’ve really just focused on single player.”</p><p>Martin and Stratton were also asked if <em>Doom: The Dark Ages</em> is an open-world game. Id Software says it’s the biggest game they have ever made and features the largest levels seen in a <em>Doom </em>game, but the devs were clear that this isn’t an open-world game like <em>Skyrim </em>or <em>Assasssin’s Creed. </em></p><p>“It’s definitely not an open-world game, but it is the most expansive world we’ve ever built,” explained Stratton. </p><p>“You really feel like you’re on a battlefield. It goes from the typical linear <em>Doom</em> to these large sandboxes where the exploration opens up, and you get multiple objectives that can be tackled in any order. Exploration is also tied to power in that you can find and unlock several upgrades for your character.”</p><h2 id="h35637"><a id=""></a><em>Dark Ages</em> isn’t inspired by <em>Quake </em>and it’s not the end of a trilogy</h2><p>Martin also said that a big thing they learned from <em>Eternal </em>was that too many currencies and skill trees can complicate a game in ways that aren’t fun. So instead, this time around exploring will make you stronger via <em>The Dark Ages</em>’ simplified progression system. </p><p>Martin also denied that <em>Doom: The Dark Ages</em> is inspired by <em>Quake</em>. Instead, <em>Batman</em> comics inspired the developers. “The inspiration was more something like <em>Batman: Year One</em> and <em>300</em>,” said Martin. </p><p>“I’m a pretty big comic book fan. But yeah, there were rumors that it was called <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/doom-3-eternal-sequel-dark-ages-year-zero-xbox-june-1851500253&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/doom-3-eternal-sequel-dark-ages-year-zero-xbox-june-1851500253"><em>Doom: Year Zero</em></a></span> and that was what we called it internally. I still think it was a really cool name, although <em>Dark Age</em>s is pretty cool, too.”</p><p>Finally, Martin was asked if <em>Dark Ages</em>, being the third game in a trilogy, is the end of this era of <em>Doom</em>. </p><p>“I don’t think I can answer that. We’re not supposed to talk about it. Anyway, I like making <em>Doom </em>games. I wouldn’t have a problem doing this for a long time. But this isn’t designed to be the end of something.”</p><p><em>Doom: The Dark Ages</em> arrives on May 15 on Xbox Series X/S, PS5, PC, and Game Pass. </p><p> .<br></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

World Quests and Random Quests are meanwhile much shorter and might have rewards such as a sketch for a cute hat or an elegant necklace.</p><h2 id="h561"><a id="chests"></a>Find new clothes in glowing chests</h2><figure id="" data-id="09e2f5fca602a0316bbc604314e5b98b" data-recommend-id="image://09e2f5fca602a0316bbc604314e5b98b" data-format="jpg" data-width="3840" data-height="2160" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Nikki stands in front of a glowing pink chest, with a mountain range in the background." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Nikki stands in front of a glowing pink chest, with a mountain range in the background." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Infold Games / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="09e2f5fca602a0316bbc604314e5b98b" data-recommend-id="image://09e2f5fca602a0316bbc604314e5b98b" data-format="jpg" data-width="3840" data-height="2160" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Nikki stands in front of a glowing pink chest, with a mountain range in the background." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>There are plenty of clothes and sketches to earn as rewards or to buy with various kinds of currencies, but a lot can be found just by wandering the world. <strong>A good amount of clothing sketches can also be found in pink treasure chests in the open world.</strong></p><p>That said, clothes do not drop from the Brown or Blue chests. Furthermore, not all the Pink Chests will have them either. Some provide you with Diamonds and Bling, while others include a sketch as well. You should aim to open any chests you come across anyway since there isn’t a visual tell for which have sketches.</p><h2 id="h562"><a id="buy"></a>Buy new threads from merchants and shops</h2><figure id="" data-id="9a55b48724d6ea4b89443b9d17a0f378" data-recommend-id="image://9a55b48724d6ea4b89443b9d17a0f378" data-format="jpg" data-width="3840" data-height="2160" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The Marques Boutique shop screen, with the Golden Elegance top highlighted." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="The Marques Boutique shop screen, with the Golden Elegance top highlighted." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Infold Games / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="9a55b48724d6ea4b89443b9d17a0f378" data-recommend-id="image://9a55b48724d6ea4b89443b9d17a0f378" data-format="jpg" data-width="3840" data-height="2160" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The Marques Boutique shop screen, with the Golden Elegance top highlighted." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Miraland is a world where clothing and fashion hold a lot of importance. Naturally, that also means they’re a hot commodity for merchants too. <strong>It’s worth checking out every shop and NPC merchant as many will be selling unique clothes.</strong> <br></p><p>This ranges from the shops open all the time to the ones that only appear during a specific time of day. From what I can tell, all clothing is limited stock and sold out once you’ve purchased them. This is a stark contrast to shops with crafting materials that will eventually restock over time.</p><h2 id="h563"><a id="nodes"></a>Upgrade nodes in the Heart of Infinity</h2><figure id="" data-id="b8898176932162365c6233ab1fc14b9f" data-recommend-id="image://b8898176932162365c6233ab1fc14b9f" data-format="jpg" data-width="3840" data-height="2160" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The Fully Charged Electrician Outfit sketch, as seen on the Heart of Infinity menu." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="The Fully Charged Electrician Outfit sketch, as seen on the Heart of Infinity menu." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Infold Games / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="b8898176932162365c6233ab1fc14b9f" data-recommend-id="image://b8898176932162365c6233ab1fc14b9f" data-format="jpg" data-width="3840" data-height="2160" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The Fully Charged Electrician Outfit sketch, as seen on the Heart of Infinity menu." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>The Heart of Infinity fulfills the role of the game’s skill tree. You can spend Whimstars and Bling here to unlock ability enhancements and stat increases for Styling Challenges. <strong>More importantly, the Heart of Infinity also has exclusive sketches for Ability Outfits and individual clothing pieces to unlock.</strong></p><p>Fortunately, you won’t be able to miss ability outfits since they’re all made available during the main story quests. The other individual pieces are typically set in between the ability enhancement and stat increase upgrades, so I suggest checking back now and then to see how much more can be unlocked.</p><h2 id="h564"><a id="surprise"></a>Pull at the Surprise-O-Matic (if you dare)</h2><figure id="" data-id="8af59d422d20a2008ac07713523ad538" data-recommend-id="image://8af59d422d20a2008ac07713523ad538" data-format="jpg" data-width="3840" data-height="2160" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The Surprise-O-Matic drawing screen, showing the limited deal that’s offered for the first pull." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="The Surprise-O-Matic drawing screen, showing the limited deal that’s offered for the first pull." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Infold Games / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="8af59d422d20a2008ac07713523ad538" data-recommend-id="image://8af59d422d20a2008ac07713523ad538" data-format="jpg" data-width="3840" data-height="2160" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The Surprise-O-Matic drawing screen, showing the limited deal that’s offered for the first pull." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>After completing the prologue quest, you’ll travel to the town of Florawish. This is the primary setting for the first two chapters. You’ll have plenty of time to explore, but something sure to catch your eye is the Gumball-machine-looking device called the Surprise-O-Matic.</p><p><strong>Acting like its own gacha banner with an exclusive item pool, the Surprise-O-Matic will drop a random piece of clothing every time you use it.</strong> The catch is that it costs 20,000 Bling to make a single pull. Additionally, there is no pity system to help you attain the rarer pieces. You could easily spend millions of Bling here before you get a 5-star piece. So spend wisely.</p><h2 id="h565"><a id="gacha"></a>Pull the gacha banners</h2><figure id="" data-id="e074b61b2108fcc8f81e1d5d0ab07afb" data-recommend-id="image://e074b61b2108fcc8f81e1d5d0ab07afb" data-format="jpg" data-width="3840" data-height="2160" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The Bubbling Affections resonance banner shows a fancy outfit and a couple of fishes with giant lips." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="The Bubbling Affections resonance banner shows a fancy outfit and a couple of fishes with giant lips." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Infold Games / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="e074b61b2108fcc8f81e1d5d0ab07afb" data-recommend-id="image://e074b61b2108fcc8f81e1d5d0ab07afb" data-format="jpg" data-width="3840" data-height="2160" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The Bubbling Affections resonance banner shows a fancy outfit and a couple of fishes with giant lips." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Speaking of gacha, that’s arguably the most prolific method of getting more clothing. <strong><em>Infinity Nikki</em> runs a series of permanent and limited-time gacha banners that you can pull to get exclusive clothes from.</strong> Anything you get from the latter will feel the most special since you presumably won’t be able to get them again unless the banner returns.</p><p>The permanent and limited-time banners use specific currencies: Resonite Crystals and Revelation Crystals. They do have a pity system to guarantee you receive a certain rarity after a while, but it still operates mostly on chance. If you see a particular item you just have to get, I recommend grinding out for the appropriate crystals.</p><h2 id="h566"><a id="store"></a>Use Stellarites at the in-game store</h2><figure id="" data-id="f85112a5d3eac198d289b40f88ba52e6" data-recommend-id="image://f85112a5d3eac198d289b40f88ba52e6" data-format="jpg" data-width="3840" data-height="2160" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The Moonlight Oath outfit, as seen in the Clothing tab in the Store." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="The Moonlight Oath outfit, as seen in the Clothing tab in the Store." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Infold Games / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="f85112a5d3eac198d289b40f88ba52e6" data-recommend-id="image://f85112a5d3eac198d289b40f88ba52e6" data-format="jpg" data-width="3840" data-height="2160" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The Moonlight Oath outfit, as seen in the Clothing tab in the Store." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>You’ll be able to exchange for <em>Infinity Nikki</em>’s various currencies through the in-game shop. This includes Diamonds, the aforementioned gacha-related crystals, and the premium currency known as Stellarite. <strong>This Store offers many things to buy with Stellarite, including exclusive outfits that can’t be unlocked elsewhere.</strong></p><p>Many of these outfits are offered on a limited-time basis. They also cost between 60 and 2980 Stellarite, which roughly translates to $1-$45. Make sure to have a calculator out to help with the awkward bundle amounts and first-time double bonuses.</p><hr><p><em>Infinity Nikki</em> has a ton of clothing items to discover and craft. We’re sure to get even more outfits and maybe even more ways to unlock them once some big updates have rolled out. Needless to say, you’ll always have plenty of choices to make the right fit.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
