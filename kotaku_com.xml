            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><em>Mad Men</em> is probably one of the best 10 television shows ever made. It’s certainly one of the most important. It came to define a late aughts “golden age” of TV when the internet was full of <a href="https://www.tumblr.com/mollylambert/115625706564/the-almost-complete-ml-mad-men-recaps-s1e1-smoke">show recaps and essays</a> and aspiring networks were racing to land prestige TV hits that would win awards and convince critics that movies were no longer the most important medium for visual storytelling. So it’s equally fitting, in a way, that 4K re-release of <em>Mad Men</em> on HBO includes sloppy oversights that make it emblematic of media’s <a href="https://kotaku.com/hbo-max-password-sharing-price-zaslav-warner-bros-2000624901">current enshitification</a> in the streaming era.</p> <p>The <a href="https://variety.com/2025/tv/news/mad-men-stream-hbo-max-4k-1236581005/">ultra-HD makeover</a> of AMC’s period drama about an advertising agency straddling the cultural revolution of 60s became available on HBO Max on December 1 and it includes some unique artistic choices. The most viral of those is leaving in the barf machine for one of the series’ most memorable moments. In season 1, episode 7, “Red in the Face,” Don Draper suckers his boss, Roger Sterling, into a late lunch break filled with booze and oysters and then races him up the Manhattan high-rise stairs when the elevator goes out of commission.</p>

 <p>Sterling gets back to the office just in time to puke in front of the entire agency, including important clients. It’s an important moment that underlines a bunch of conflicting fault lines within their relationship. It’s also very gross. In the new 4K version, viewers are treated to the actual puke machine that hurls clam chowder out a pipe next to Sterling’s face, as well as the stage hands deploying it. It’s beautifully absurd and also kind of undercuts the entire scene.</p>

 <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">the new 4K transfer of mad men on HBO somehow does not have any of the post-production edits added in, which means you get stuff like this where you can see the crew member manning the puke machine after Roger has too many oysters lmao <a href="https://t.co/HNgPRNOsla">pic.twitter.com/HNgPRNOsla</a></p> <p>— johnny (@bigrackspart7) <a href="https://twitter.com/bigrackspart7/status/1995756905755549751?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 2, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <p>“This is hilarious, and the extra hand on the crew member’s shoulder is killing me,” <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/madmen/comments/1pbqafk/red_in_the_face_hbomax_4k_shows_staff_operating/">wrote</a> one commenter on Reddit. “Like someone else is giving him extra emotional support while he shoots fake vomit from a tube.” We’ve seen this sort of thing happen before, but it’s usually when <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/paddypadman.bsky.social/post/3m6z3bnqxjs2u">older shows get updated to newer aspect ratios</a> and stuff that wasn’t originally intended to be part of the scene makes it into the frame.</p>

 <p>The fact that the apparatus and its handlers weren’t scrubbed out in post-production, as they were for the original version of the show, raises bigger questions about just how carefully HBO handled the re-release of one of modern TV’s most storied series. What kind of penny-pinching apathy lets the barf machine skate through the review process unscathed, and in the first season no less?</p>

 <p>I casually started re-watching &nbsp;while doing other stuff just a couple weeks ago and made it through the first two seasons in no time. Who at Warner Bros. Discovery thought it was a good idea to bring <em>Mad Men</em> back to a major streaming platform for the first time since it left Netflix back in 2020 and not skim it for issues? Especially since it was being upscaled to 4K? If they didn’t even catch the barf machine, what else did they miss?</p> <p>Well, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/madmen/comments/1pc20pw/season_one_out_of_order_on_hbo_max/">the episode order for one</a>. At least some users, including myself, tried to watch season 1, episode 7 only to find that it had swapped places <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/madmen/comments/1pbth6b/red_in_the_face_replaced_with_5g_on_hbo/">with episode 6</a>, which had swapped places with episode 5. I guess David Zaslav didn’t want to pay someone’s nephew to sit in a room and do a final view test before releasing the 4K cut. Too busy thinking about Scrooge McDucking his way through mountains of cash if as Netflix and Skydance <a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/business/business-news/warner-bros-discovery-new-bids-netflix-comcast-paramount-1236439442/">get into a bidding war</a> over Warner Bros.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/samsung-doesnt-care-about-profit-on-galaxy-tab-a9-plus-priced-like-budget-android-tablet-2000649277</link>
            <guid>1370479</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div dir="auto" data-message-author-role="assistant" data-message-id="72447a38-387f-40b8-a390-2b9e2ddb309a" data-message-model-slug="gpt-5-1">
<p data-start="0" data-end="371">With Black Friday and Cyber Monday behind us, you may think the time to save has come to an end. You couldn’t be more wrong. Lots of brands are keeping their discounts hanging around a little longer past the biggest sales event of the year. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6175/">For instance, the Samsung Galaxy Tab A9+ is currently available for a drastically reduced price of $150.</a> The Samsung tablet normally sells for $220, so this 32% discount represents a savings of $70. Get it for as low as $150 for a limited time.</p>
<p data-start="0" data-end="371">The design of the Galaxy Tab A9+ is both slim and lightweight, making it perfect for on-the-go use. It’s durable enough to withstand daily handling, whether you’re commuting, working at a café, or just moving between rooms at home.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6175/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h3 data-start="373" data-end="414">Exceptional Display and Sound Quality</h3>
<p data-start="416" data-end="960">For under $150, you get an 11″ touchscreen with an LCD display boasting a 1200p resolution and a 90 Hz refresh rate. Whether you’re streaming videos or just browsing the internet, the visuals are sharp and smooth. The tablet’s built-in speakers deliver clear, rich sound, enhanced by Dolby Atmos technology to give you “cinema-like audio your ears will love.” Now those are Samsung’s words, not mine. Marketing fluff. In practice, the only similarity between the sound when watching something on this tablet and watching something in a movie theater is that they are both indeed sound. So while it’s a bit of a stretch to compare tablet sound to a full cinema experience, it certainly provides better audio than most tablets in its class.</p>
<h3 data-start="1293" data-end="1342">Storage Options and Multitasking Capabilities</h3>
<p data-start="1344" data-end="1675">When it comes to storage, the Galaxy Tab A9+ offers two options: 64 GB in the more affordable model and 128 GB in the higher-end version. This gives you plenty of room for apps, photos, and videos. However, given the rise of streaming services, you might find that you rely more on streaming content rather than downloading media. In which case, the 64 GB model should suffice.</p>
<p data-start="1677" data-end="1996">Powered by Android OS, the tablet makes it easy to multitask and switch between apps. You can view multiple apps side by side—great for when you’re managing multiple tabs in your browser or just keeping an eye on your email while working.</p>
<p data-start="1998" data-end="2273">File transfer is also a breeze thanks to Samsung’s Quick Share feature. It allows you to easily send files to another device, whether it’s running Android or iOS. Transferring photos, documents, or videos between your devices is quick and convenient.</p>


<h3 data-start="2275" data-end="2299">Perfect for Families</h3>
<p data-start="2301" data-end="2673">One feature that parents will appreciate is the Samsung Kids app. If you’re not ready to buy a dedicated tablet for your child, the Galaxy Tab A9+ offers a safe, fun, and educational environment for younger users. With its playful interface and age-appropriate content, it’s a great way to keep kids entertained while ensuring they’re using technology in a safe way.</p>
<p data-start="2699" data-end="3001" data-is-last-node="" data-is-only-node=""><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6175/">If you’re looking for a deal, now is the time to grab the Samsung Galaxy Tab A9+.</a> The 64 GB model is priced at just $150 after the 32% discount. Don’t miss out on this limited-time offer, available on Amazon in this post-Cyber Monday opportunity.</p>

Eagle-eyed fans of the series, however, were quick to point out a few interesting tidbits, namely the presence of what looks like a pirate ship.</p> <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">Tis the season ❄️</p> <p>Free goodies will be waiting for you in your Hideout every day in December up until the 25th 🎁!<a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/AssassinsCreedShadows?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#AssassinsCreedShadows</a> <a href="https://t.co/ECo0kiD7yp">pic.twitter.com/ECo0kiD7yp</a></p> <p>— Assassin's Creed (@assassinscreed) <a href="https://twitter.com/assassinscreed/status/1995175995670777942?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 30, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <p>Pirate ships are nothing new to <i>Assassin’s Creed</i>, of course. Perhaps one of the most celebrated titles in the long-running series, <i>Assassin’s Creed IV Black Flag</i>, was all about the life of a blade-wielding pirate named Edward Kenway. A remake of the classic entry has been rumored for some time, with indications that <a href="https://kotaku.com/assassins-creed-black-flag-remake-ubisoft-sold-ai-2000646161">it might arrive sometime before spring of 2026</a>.</p>

<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6173/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<p>With speeds of up to 2,000 MB/s, it outperforms many other portable drives on the market, including its predecessor, the Samsung T7, which has a maximum speed of 1,000 MB/s. This makes the T9 perfect for handling large files.</p>
<p>Despite its high transfer speeds, the Samsung T9 remains impressively cool even during extended use. Thanks to its built-in Dynamic Thermal Guard, the drive efficiently manages heat, ensuring that it stays within an optimal temperature range. This means you can work on intensive tasks like video editing or large file transfers without worrying about overheating.</p>
<p>For videographers, the Samsung T9 SSD is an exceptional choice, allowing you to record directly onto the drive from compatible cameras or smartphones like the iPhone 15 Pro. It supports 4K video recording at 60 frames per second. Great for when your iPhone storage is near capacity and you don’t feel like scrolling through a decades worth of photos and video, looking for stuff to delete to make room.</p>



<h2>Strong. Solid. Stable.</h2>
<p>Built with durability in mind, the Samsung T9 can withstand the wear and tear of daily use. The drive is drop-resistant from heights of up to three meters, making it perfect for creators on the go. If you’re traveling for work or shooting in unpredictable environments, the T9 is a drive you can rely on. Plus, it comes with a generous five-year warranty, providing peace of mind in case something goes wrong.</p>
<p>If security is a concern, the T9 allows you to enable password protection. For anyone who frequently travels with their drive, it ensures your sensitive files remain secure, even if you accidentally leave the drive behind at a coffee shop or airport.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6173/">For a limited time, the Samsung T9 SSD is available at a significant discount</a>. The 1TB version is priced at just $95, while the 2TB model is available for $185, and the 4TB version is down to $299.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><span>As we get closer to </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-legends-za-review-switch-2-bugs-performance-2000637719"><i><span>Pokémon Legends: Z-A</span></i><span>’s</span></a> <a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-legends-za-mega-dimension-dlc-new-raichu-2000641644"><i><span>Mega Dimension </span></i><span>DLC</span></a><span> next Wednesday, December 10, Game Freak is adding another missing monster and Mega Evolution to the RPG’s roster. Thankfully, you won’t have to buy the $30 DLC to get this one, as Mewtwo and its two Mega Evolutions are coming to </span><i><span>Legends: Z-A </span></i><span>as a free Mystery Gift side mission.</span></p> <p><span>Mewtwo and its Mega Stones are available now in </span><i><span>Legends: Z-A</span></i><span>, and they’re totally free. To capture this Legendary Pokémon, you’ll have to download a new side quest through the game’s Mystery Gift feature. Open up the Link Play option in the pause menu, then click on Mystery Gift, and then the “Get via Internet” option. Here, you’ll find a new side quest called “Project M,” which will add the psychic legend to the game.&nbsp;</span></p>

  <p><span>With this addition, </span><i><span>Legends: Z-A </span></i><span>is one step closer to hopefully adding every Mega Evolution-capable Pokémon to the roster with </span><i><span>Mega Dimension</span></i><span>. As of right now, the base game has just about all of them, with around a dozen or so still missing in action. Most of these are legendary Pokémon like Mewtwo, Latios, Latias, and Rayquaza, but a few of the old starters like Blaziken, Sceptile, and Swampert are also missing in action.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><i><span>Mega Dimension </span></i><span>is also introducing several new Mega Evolutions that weren’t in the base game, including Mega Raichu X and Y. Also today, Game Freak announced Mega Lucario Z, </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-legends-za-mega-dimension-evolution-lucario-z-2000649602"><span>a new form for Lucario</span></a><span>, who previously had a Mega Evolution prior to the DLC. So it sounds like even some Pokémon who already had these superpowered transformations might be getting more. Outside of new Megas, the DLC is also introducing a roguelike mode that will </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-legends-za-mega-dimension-dlc-level-cap-100-2000641765"><span>break the series’ long-established level 100 level cap</span></a><span>.</span></p>
