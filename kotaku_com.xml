            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><span>Have you ever wondered what might happen if you put </span><i><span>Armored Core</span></i><span> and </span><i><span><a href="https://kotaku.com/castlevania-roguelike-vampire-survivors-steam-itch-io-1848402308">Vampire Survivors</a></span></i><span> into opposite ends of the teleporter from </span><i><span>The Fly</span></i><span> and flipped the switch? The resulting mash-up would probably look a lot like </span><i><span>Vital Shell</span></i><span>, a game by solo developer Marvin Wizard released to Steam on January 8.</span></p> <p><i><span>Vital Shell</span></i><span>, fortunately, is less a monstrous example of scientific hubris and more a competent, top-down arena shooter that combines fantasy mechs with automatic battling mechanics and adds an aesthetic splash of PlayStation 1 visuals and ambient jungle music for good vibes. I spent a few rounds running the game through its paces after noticing its launch this morning and, folks, it’s pretty dang fun.</span></p>

  <p><span>If you’ve played </span><i><span>Vampire Survivors</span></i><span>, you should mostly know what to expect here. </span><i><span>Vital Shell</span></i><span> places players in control of a giant robot and tasks them with destroying everything in their wake. What this looks like in practice is kiting waves of enemy hordes around a nondescript battlefield, persisting long enough to level up, and building an ever-improving kit of weaponry and upgrades for tackling the challenges ahead.</span></p>

 <p><span>As fun as </span><i><span>Vital Shell</span></i><span> is gameplay-wise, it really excels in presentation. The level-up screen looks like something out of early installments of </span><i><span>Armored Core</span></i><span>, and the clean 3D graphics make it easy to distinguish friend from foe during raucous battles. Marvin Wizard also developed the game</span> <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/3741860/view/506206686159048296"><span>with a “console-first approach” from the beginning</span></a><span>, which means the menus are snappy and easy to navigate via controller. I first tried playing </span><i><span>Vital Shell</span></i><span> with mouse and keyboard but quickly switched to my trusty DualSense and haven’t looked back.</span></p>

 <figure id="attachment_2000658254" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000658254"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000658254">MarvinWizard</figcaption></figure> <p><i><span>Vital Shell</span></i><span> is now available on Steam for $4.79 (the price goes up to $5.99 after January 21), alongside</span> <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3928280/Vital_Shell_Demo_Disc/"><span>a demo-disc-style preview</span></a><span> if you want to try before you buy. It’s a solo affair at the moment, but Marvin Wizard is exploring the addition of co-op in a future update.</span></p>

            <title><![CDATA[For Wolfenstein 3 To Be Good, It Needs To Punch Nazis Even Harder]]></title>
            <link>https://kotaku.com/wolfenstein-3-sequel-nazis-trump-ice-machinegames-2000658228</link>
            <guid>1400974</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><span>The news that </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/wolfenstein-3-in-development-machinegames-bethesda-2000657758"><i><span>Wolfenstein 3</span></i></a><span> is in the works is music to my ears. I’ve long been a fan of Sweden-based MachineGames’ take on </span><i><span>Wolfenstein</span></i><span>, which transforms B.J. Blazkowicz’s one-man war on occult-powered Nazis into a grisly and moving narrative about the strength of family and communities while finding oneself amidst endless conflict. </span><i><span>Wolfenstein 2</span></i><span> showed the importance of resisting the narrative that fascism can and will win. If I have one concrete hope for a potential sequel, it’s that it doesn’t ease up on the gas.</span></p> <p><span>The first of these games, </span><i><span>Wolfenstein: The New Order</span></i><span> is</span><span> really good, as is its prequel, <em>The Old Blood</em>. Their shooting chops have always been up to snuff and their unflinching narratives were a breath of fresh air at a time when FPS fare was beginning to feel a little same-y. They had a stylish verve that was becoming all-too uncommon and paired B.J. with the likes of alt-history takes on Jimi Hendrix and Nikola Tesla. Besides that, it was also refreshingly novel to play an FPS about Nazis at a time where it seemed like most of the genre was ditching the past in favor of modern and future conflicts. It was 2014, and we couldn’t have known what was to come.</span></p> <p><i><span>Wolfenstein: The New Colossu</span></i><span>s was an entirely different story. Arriving in the fall of 2017, </span><i><span>The New Colossus</span></i><span> struck like lightning. Its unveiling and marketing beats reveled in the joy of ripping fascists to shreds, while </span><a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/fps/8-years-after-wolfenstein-2-vowed-to-make-america-nazi-free-again-multiple-reports-suggest-wolfenstein-3-is-finally-in-development/"><span>leaning into the dystopic headlines</span></a><span> Americans increasingly became inundated with. It adopted the “punch Nazis now, ask questions later” ideology that emerged amid Donald Trump’s first presidency and the rise of the alt-right. More specifically, it leaned into that time that Richard Spencer–a Neo-Nazi and early figurehead of the alt-right movement–got </span><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aFh08JEKDYk"><span>decked</span></a><span> by an unknown assailant on camera.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>At the time, many criticized publisher Bethesda’s decision to appropriate some of this language and rhetoric throughout </span><i><span>The New Colossus’</span></i><span> marketing cycle. Fans of the games and companies involved openly protested against the game on social media, and even threatened to boycott it.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>During an interview with </span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Wolfenstein/comments/7ap3n8/hey_bethseda_youre_game_is_making_people_mad/"><i><span>Vice News</span></i></a><span> which centered on this outrage, Bethesda’s then-director of PR, Pete Hines, told the outlet, “Unless you’re a Nazi, there should be nobody who’s opposed to the idea of being against Nazis.” When told that the game’s aggressive marketing tone might be poking the hornet’s nest, Hines even doubled down, saying, “Maybe a little bit, but the hornet’s nest is full of Nazis so…fuck those guys. I’ll poke a Nazi hornet’s nest.”</span></p>  <p><i><span>The New Colossus</span></i><span>‘ narrative was as brazen as its marketing campaign and bold in a way few games have managed since, focusing on a Nazi-occupied America and how B.J. and his allies, the Kreisau Circle, begin fomenting rebellion at home. It is filled with sights that are still hard to shake, like KKK members in full Klan garb chumming it up with Nazi shocktroopers on the streets of Roswell, New Mexico. And it is filled with characters and pulse-pounding dialogue exchanges that interrogate whether America has ever really been the virtuous home of freedom its most patriotic defendants claim it to be. After all, America under Nazi rule in <em>The New Colossus </em>looks a lot like America always has</span><span>.</span></p> <p><span>Maybe the root of evil wasn’t abroad all along. Maybe it’s been in us the whole time. And maybe we never really stamped it out because the blood and cruelty which it produces has always greased the wheels of this </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/no-games-for-genocide-xbox-microsoft-boycott-palestine-2000650175"><span>damnable, infernal machine</span></a><span>.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>And yet B.J. and his allies fight like hell to dismantle it. They take on impossible odds, which manifest in </span><i><span>The New Colossus</span></i><span>‘ difficulty spikes and often brutal gauntlets and level design. B.J. himself even takes a detour into his past and confronts the earliest source of evil in his life: his racist, abusive father, Rip. And you know what he does? He exorcizes his demons. It is cathartic to be in B.J.’s shoes at that crucial moment when he takes back his life from Rip, who dies at the hands of his own son in defense of an America that, in his own words, has become “a white man’s world now.” And it is cathartic to take that rage and rip into Nazis for several more hours afterwards.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><i><span>Wolfenstein: The New Colossus</span></i><span> could not have more perfectly matched the moment it emerged into. Its European developers definitely seem like they were tuned into the national conversation overseas and the growing political divide in America, but I don’t believe any of them would go so far as to say they predicted the exact descent into fascism which the game’s development and release would parallel. </span><i><span>Wolfenstein 3</span></i><span>, however, could be an entirely different story.</span></p> <p><span>Even if </span><i><span>Wolfenstein 3</span></i><span> is only in the earliest stages of production right now, it could still arrive near the end of Trump’s second presidency. And lord knows the material that MachineGames has to work with nowadays. That loser notion that Rip died defending? Well, that seems like the primary ambition of the current U.S. administration, which continues to stoke fires both abroad and at home in pursuit of this goal. Look no further than the way that the administration has continually sicced ICE–the </span><a href="https://www.404media.co/inside-ices-tool-to-monitor-phones-in-entire-neighborhoods/"><span>president’s own secret police</span></a><span> at this point–on American citizens in a manufactured war on immigrants, rounded people up into camps, and even claimed the lives of innocents, as many saw with the </span><a href="https://defector.com/ice-agent-kills-woman-dhs-tells-obvious-insane-lies-about-it"><span>murder of Renee Nicole Good</span></a><span> in Minneapolis on January 7.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>If </span><i><span>The New Colossus</span></i><span> felt like a heightened, yet prescient take on the politics of the 2010s, what might a follow-up in the wake of the declining American empire under a second Trump administration look like? Neither you nor I can really say, but if it’s anything like its predecessors, it will be abrasive, unhinged, and rightfully angry at the rot we’ve observed in the time since </span><i><span>Wolfenstein </span></i><span>was last in the limelight. At the naked abuses of power which dominate our timelines and drive our seemingly routine descents into madness. At the normalization of Nazi shit and cruelty. I could use a place to vent all that frustration. Maybe, just maybe, </span><i><span>Wolfenstein 3 </span></i><span>will fill that role perfectly whenever it arrives.</span></p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/final-fantasy-7-rebirth-minigames-remake-trilogy-3-game-2000658234</link>
            <guid>1400953</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><i><span>Final Fantasy VII Remake</span></i><span>’s third and final entry is still years away, but Square Enix is actively developing whatever comes after 2024’s </span><i><span>Rebirth</span></i><span>. The sequel was notoriously </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/final-fantasy-7-rebirth-mini-games-best-worst-ranked-1851340606"><span>minigame heavy</span></a><span>, and while the </span><i><span>Remake </span></i><span>trilogy already felt like it was </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/final-fantasy-7-rebirth-remake-mini-games-third-game-1851272221"><span>straining to make three games out of one</span></a><span>, </span><i><span>Rebirth</span></i><span>’s reliance on minigames to pad the length really pushed things past the limit. Other than </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/final-fantasy-7-rebirth-ending-cloud-aerith-sephiroth-1851374178"><span>its divisive ending</span></a><span>, it’s probably the most widely derided part of the game, but it doesn’t sound like this criticism has deterred Square from this approach.</span></p> <p><span>In </span><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jbrBjFZabUE"><span>an interview with </span><i><span>GamerBraves</span></i></a><span>, </span><i><span>Rebirth </span></i><span>director Naoki Hamaguchi was asked about </span><i><span>Rebirth</span></i><span>’s inclusion of heaps of minigames, with interviewer Sean Lim noting that some players felt the onslaught interrupted the game’s pacing. Hamaguchi said that the team’s intention was to not only shake up what the player was doing throughout </span><i><span>Rebirth</span></i><span>’s lengthy runtime, but also pay homage to the original </span><i><span>Final Fantasy VII</span></i><span>, which had its fair share of minigames as well.</span></p>

  <blockquote><p><span>So, that’s not a unique problem for </span><i><span>Final Fantasy VII Rebirth</span></i><span> only. A lot of games, aside from the main theme and main story progression, also have the side games and the minigames built into them. So, we don’t think we’re unique in that aspect. So when you’re playing the game and you’re going through the main story progression, as well as the intended game design, you tend to fall into this trap of having the same tempo. So, you tend to get bored playing it. To sort of combat this and keep that fresh feeling of going through the game, that’s why we introduced these minigames, to sort of add a diversity of experience as you’re playing the game, to keep up the good rhythm, so to say. So we understand when you introduce these different facets, some people would play it and really enjoy it, but some people would rather just get on with the main story. So it’s sort of a calculated move on our part to include all these different facets of the game. Whether it’s the amount of minigames or the pacing [with which] we introduce them, so on the creator side, it’s sort of something we have taken into account when we do the game design.</span></p> <p><span>So the original </span><i><span>Final Fantasy VII</span></i><span> also had lots of minigames, and it was very famous for that. So, when [we] were entrusted with doing the remake, [we] sort of wanted to keep that spirit of the diversity of play within the title, so that people can have lots of different experiences the same way they did with </span><i><span>Final Fantasy VII</span></i><span>.</span></p></blockquote> <p><span>I can appreciate wanting to be true to the original RPG’s minigames, but </span><i><span>Rebirth</span></i><span>’s obvious use of it as filler goes far beyond reimagining. It would be helpful if each diversion was good, but they varied from the good as hell </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/ff7-rebirth-queens-blood-naoki-hamaguchi-interview-1851312733"><span>Queen’s Blood card game</span></a><span> to the infamous </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/final-fantasy-7-rebirth-cait-sith-box-throw-mod-remove-1851744876"><span>Cait Sith box throwing segment</span></a><span>. Walking through </span><i><span>Rebirth</span></i><span>’s open world was like trying to cross a minefield where the most obnoxious, unskippable landmines were waiting for you if you stepped in the wrong direction. </span></p>

 <p><span>Hamaguchi doesn’t say if this will persist into the next </span><i><span>Final Fantasy VII Remake</span></i><span> game, but he has said elsewhere that the third game will </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/final-fantasy-7-rebirth-part-3-remake-length-how-long-2000637274"><span>be more concise</span></a><span>, so hopefully that means&nbsp; the minigames get dialed down a bit in the final chapter. Or let Sephiroth strike me down.</span></p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/witcher-3-dlc-zerrikania-expansion-rumor-2000658222</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/the-witcher-3-wild-hunt-the-kotaku-review-1703766283"><i><span>The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt</span></i></a><span> turns 11 years old in May. Its last big update was a next-gen version released in 2022. But that hasn’t stopped speculation from mounting about a surprise expansion dropping sometime soon for the beloved open-world RPG.</span></p> <p><span>Rumors first began to swirl last summer, when prominent Polish leaker Borys Nieśpielak said he</span> <a href="https://kotaku.com/witcher-3-dlc-ciri-geralt-sequel-cdpr-2000655922"><span>suspected</span></a><span> developer CD Projekt Red might reveal new content for </span><i><span>The Witcher 3</span></i><span> at the Game Awards. And while this</span><a href="https://kotaku.com/everything-we-saw-at-the-2025-game-awards-2000652719"> <span>obviously didn’t come to pass</span></a><span>, rumors of the expansion’s possible existence have only continued to pile up in the months since:</span></p>

 <ul> <li aria-level="1"><span>During a November 2025 investor call, CD Projekt CFO Piotr Nielubowicz</span> <a href="https://www.cdprojekt.com/en/wp-content/uploads-en/2025/11/transcript-q3-2025-earnings-3.pdf"><span>implied</span></a><span> the existence of an unannounced product (via</span><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/is-there-really-going-to-be-a-2026-witcher-3-expansion"> <i><span>Eurogamer</span></i></a><span>), saying, “Given our current progress, there is a chance that new content hinted upon in recent calls and reports may see release in the coming year.”</span></li> <li aria-level="1"><span>CEO Michał Nowakowski also chimed in about a mystery project in a Q&amp;A session following the presentation, telling investors that a majority of the workforce at support studio Fool’s Theory is working on it (via</span><a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-witcher-3-secret-expansion-rumors-swirl-after-cd-projekt-hints-at-new-content"> <i><span>IGN</span></i></a><span>), later noting this amounted to over 100 developers.</span></li> <li aria-level="1"><span>Polish Noble Securities analyst Mateusz Chrzanowski last month</span> <a href="https://strefainwestorow.pl/analizy/noblesecurities-cdprojekt-wiedzmin-dlc-orion-cyberpunk"><span>forecasted</span></a><span> a “paid add-on” with a budget of 52 million PLN (or around $14 million USD), scheduled for release in May 2026 (via</span><a href="https://www.dexerto.com/gaming/new-witcher-3-dlc-expected-in-early-2026-to-set-up-the-witcher-4-3297731"> <i><span>Dexerto</span></i></a><span>). “The release should kick off the actual marketing campaign for </span><i><span>The Witcher 4</span></i><span>,” Chrzanowski added, according to a rough machine translation.</span></li> <li aria-level="1"><span>The heart of Chzanowski’s prediction has to do with CD Projekt Red’s corporate incentive program for the studio, </span><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/witcher-3-expansion-rumours-analyst-100-percent-certain-cd-projekt-red-will-release-significant-new-content-this-year"><i><span>Eurogamer </span></i><span>reports</span></a><span>. “Currently, PLN 700 million [£144m] is needed to meet the first threshold, with only five quarters remaining,” Chrzanowski explained. “This implies the need for something significantly larger than just another update or a version for a niche platform.”</span></li> </ul> <h2>Why <em>Witcher</em> fans are talking about Zerrikania</h2> <p><span>Fast-forward to January 8. </span><a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-witcher-3-expansion-reports-continue-now-with-discussion-of-a-possible-dune-style-location"><i><span>IGN Poland</span></i></a><span> reports local sources had previously known about a potential expansion to </span><i><span>The Witcher 3</span></i><span> for years. Furthermore, early rumors indicated the developers were at some point possibly interested in using an isolated, desert region known as Zerrikania as the add-on’s setting. Zerrikania is located to the east of the Northern Kingdoms (i.e. where most of </span><i><span>The Witcher</span></i><span> video game series takes place) and, according to</span> <a href="https://witcher.fandom.com/wiki/The_Wonders_of_Zerrikania"><span>an in-game book</span></a><span>, is home to dragon worship, tattooed “warriors maids,” and man-killing flies. Scary.</span></p>

 <p><span>With </span><i><span>The Witcher 4</span></i><span> planned to release</span> <a href="https://kotaku.com/witcher-4-2027-release-window-investor-call-ps6-cdpr-1851772310"><span>no sooner than January 2027</span></a><span>, it wouldn’t be shocking if CD Projekt wanted to fill the gap with something to tide fans over, especially if the long-awaited sequel slips into the next console generation. Of course, this is all still speculation, but the evidence is certainly building up to </span><i><span>something</span></i><span>.</span></p>

 <p><span>One thing we do know for sure is that sometime this year, </span><i><span>The Witcher 3</span></i><span> is getting </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/witcher-3-mod-support-ps5-xbox-final-patch-1851783100"><span>mod support on consoles</span></a><span>. The update was supposed to arrive last year but slipped to 2026. Hopefully that’s not all CDPR has planned. </span></p>
