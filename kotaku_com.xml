            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><span>Yesterday, the Trump Administration, in all its brain-rotting glory, posted </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/donald-trump-halo-gamestop-console-wars-meme-ai-images-2000639237"><span>an AI mockup of the president in Master Chief armor</span></a><span> as it declared that the man, who has likely never played a moment of </span><i><span>Halo </span></i><span>in his life, had ended the console war. This whole thing started because retail chain GameStop made a joke about the bitter feud between PlayStation and Xbox players finally ending, thanks to the impending arrival of </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/halo-remake-campaign-evolved-playstation-cross-play-2000638951"><i><span>Halo: Campaign Evolved </span></i><span>on PS5</span></a><span>. For some reason, the administration jumped in, presumably because someone on staff pays attention to video game news and only views the world through a memetic lens. Now, in what I can only assume is further committing to the bit, the White House has put out a statement declaring not only that&nbsp; Trump has ended a war, but that he is “hugely popular” with gamers.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>In a statement issued to journalist and ex-</span><i><span>Kotaku </span></i><span>editor </span><a href="https://www.patreon.com/posts/exclusive-white-142217261?utm_medium=clipboard_copy&amp;utm_source=copyLink&amp;utm_campaign=postshare_creator&amp;utm_content=join_link&amp;fbclid=PAZnRzaANtDVtleHRuA2FlbQIxMQABpz3WlKQSLeaQPnwHSgd_8kbdaOk9khYlDlkGwojXSUxrjZoBTQMEypzyzDjJ_aem_4-XJdI-3mwtRpkA9nPgsXQ"><span>Alyssa Mercante</span></a><span>, the White House said that he is the only leader “fully committed to giving power to the players,” which is a reference to GameStop’s tagline. So, taking this at face value, the Trump administration is claiming credit for Microsoft bringing its longest-running series to PlayStation, and saying that under his presidency, gamers are thriving.</span></p>

 <p><span>“Yet another war ended under President Trump’s watch—only one leader is fully committed to giving power to the players, and that leader is Donald J. Trump,” the statement reads. “That’s why he’s hugely popular with the American people and American Gamers.”</span></p>

 <p><span>Putting aside that this is obviously just some White House goon taking the piss out of a situation for the meme, the fact of the matter is, the video game industry has been </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/ps5-gta-6-price-switch-2-trump-tariff-2000618881"><span>thrown into a tailspin by the Trump administration</span></a><span>. The president’s </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/switch-2-price-trump-tariffs-vietnam-china-trade-war-1851774438"><span>tariffs have increased console prices</span></a><span> across the board, with </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/nintendo-switch-2-prices-pro-controllers-tariffs-amiibo-2000614471"><span>Nintendo</span></a><span>, </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/ps5-console-price-increase-sony-america-august-21-2000618873"><span>Sony</span></a><span>, and Microsoft all raising their respective price tags on systems and accessories over the course of 2025. Xbox </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/xbox-series-x-s-price-hike-raise-trump-tariff-microsoft-2000627228"><span>even did it twice</span></a><span>, though it does sound like Microsoft’s internal shifts </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/xbox-microsoft-price-hike-game-pass-layoffs-new-console-2000638546"><span>have contributed to that</span></a><span> as well.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>Trump has done tangible damage to the video game industry in the past 10 months, and yet, there’s an odd, concerted effort within his administration to brand him as some kind of gamer-friendly leader. This includes dumb shit like these memes, but also the Department of Homeland Security’s use of imagery from video games and anime, such as </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/department-homeland-security-halo-ice-pokemon-video-dhs-2000639308"><i><span>Halo</span></i></a> <span>and </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-responds-to-dhs-video-using-the-original-animes-theme-2000628222"><i><span>Pokémon</span></i></a><span>,&nbsp; to try and recruit people to ICE. Misinformation and fascist rhetoric is the Trump administration’s M.O., however, so they’re counting on people to clap and cheer at stupid posts of the president dressed as a character they like while he simultaneously undermines the very industry they’re a fan of. Anyone who falls for this isn’t paying attention, and if a fascist playing AI-generated dress-up as Master Chief is enough to get you to ignore this on top of all the bigger problems happening because of this idiot’s nationwide ego trip, we are well and truly fucked.</span></p>

              <p>Laptops come in all sizes and specs. If your everyday routine involves some heavy multitasking, working with creative apps, gaming with friends or hopping on video calls frequently, you need a machine that won’t slow you down. Think at least 30GB RAM, a spacious solid state, and a powerful processor that’s made to handle whatever your productive days throw at it. Sure, the market’s full of options, but finding one that’s powerful and reasonably priced? That’s the tricky part, but we’ve got good news.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5055/">We just spotted the 16-inch Lenovo IdeaPad Slim 3 on Amazon for just $799, after a massive 73% off its regular price.</a> You’re getting premium, high-end specs for less than $800, which makes it feel like a steal. Just note that the discount is only around for a short time. We recommend getting your orders in before the retailer pushes the price back up to $3,000.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5055/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Heavier Workloads Won’t Be a Problem</h2>
<p>Ideapads are sleek laptops, but they don’t compromise on performance; at all. Here, you’re getting a powerful Intel Core i7-13620H chip that packs 10 cores and 16 threads with clock speeds up to 4.9GHz. It’s made for heavier workloads and even surpasses Intel’s Ultra 7 255U in benchmark comparisons, but that’s not it. The processor is paired with a massive 40GB of DDR5 RAM, which makes it easy to power through demanding tasks without a hint of lag. Using a bunch of different apps at once, hopping between tabs, taking video calls while also presenting – none of that is going to slow you down.</p>
<p>Then there’s the 2TB PCIe SSD that offers plenty of space to store all your data, plus ultra-fast boot times and quicker file access. The display is a 16-inch WUXGA (1920 x 1200) IPS anti-glare panel that delivers sharp, vibrant visuals in all lighting conditions. The 300-nit brightness and 45% NTSC color coverage keep things easy on the eyes, even during longer usage.</p>



<p>Connectivity-wise, you’re covered with Wi-Fi 6, Bluetooth 5.2, a USB-C port (with PD and DisplayPort), two USB-A ports, HDMI, a headphone/mic combo jack, and even a full-sized SD card reader. The machine runs on Windows 11 Pro, which is a great option for both students and work professionals alike.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5055/">There’s a lot more to like about the Lenovo Ideapad 3, especially now that it’s down to $799</a>. Snag it up for less while the offer is still live.</p>

However, SSDs used with the PS5 does require additional cooling. If you’d like to use this SSD with your PS5 console, it’s recommended you pick yourself up a heatsink.

              <p>Earbuds are great, but they don’t compare to the sound quality achievable with a pair of headphones. You can even get a pretty solid pair for not much cash. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5054/">Right now, Amazon has the Beats Solo 4 on-ear Bluetooth headphones on sale for 35% off.</a> That ends up bringing the price down by $70. The headphones start at $200, so that brings the price down to just $130. This is the lowest price we’ve seen for the Beats Solo 4 since the summer.</p>
<p>Now, even though these on-ear headphones can produce pretty stellar sound, do note that they do not support active noise cancellation or transparency mode like some of the premium model Beats do. The option of turning on noise cancelling is super practical and can be great to have, but its one of those features that can really jack up the price of a pair of headphones. So you end up getting high-quality audio at a fraction of the price by going without ANC. If that’s a deal breaker for you though, check out the Beats Studio Pro instead.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5054/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>All-Day Listening</h2>
<p>With the Beats Solo 4, you can expect to get a full 50 hours of playtime off on just a single charge. That’s more than two days of non-stop listening if you really wanted to. Then when they finally do die down to zero percent, they can charge up super quickly. Say you’re about to head out for the day and realize you forgot to plug them in overnight. Not a problem. The Beats Solo 4 support fast fuel charging which can bring your battery up from dead to five full hours of listening time after charging the set for just 10 minutes.</p>
<p>That long battery life wouldn’t do you any good if the headphones weren’t comfortable to wear. Well, the Beats Solo 4 have an ultralight yet durable construction which means you can keep them on throughout the entire day without them weighing down your noggin. Plus, the flex-grip headband with adjustable angled ear cup and plush ear cushions help to ensure they stay snuggly fit and comfy for all sizes and shapes of heads.</p>



<p>Connecting to your Beats Solo 4 is easy whether you have an iPhone or an Android. The headphones support touch to pair functionality with is exactly what it sounds like. Just touch you phone to your headphones and you’ll immediately be able to listen to your favorite music, audiobooks, or podcasts.</p>
<p>Choose between five different color options which include matte black, black gold, cloud pink, metallic pink, or slate blue. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5054/">All colorways are on sale for $70 off for a limited time.</a></p>
