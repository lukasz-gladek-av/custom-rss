              <p>Sony’s <a href="https://kotaku.com/unsold-ps2-game-walmart-reddit-pbr-bull-riding-weird-reddit-2000637727">PlayStation 2 turned 25 years old this week</a>. I’m sorry if you suddenly feel very old. But don’t worry, I feel old, too! Anyway, to celebrate the milestone, Circana senior director Mat Piscatella shared some data about the console, including its best-selling games as well as the home console’s most-purchased accessory.</p> <p>On October 26, 2000, Sony launched the PS2 in North America, and it quickly became one of the most successful video game console releases in history. In the United States alone, the console would go on to sell over 45 million units, and globally it has shipped 160 million, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_best-selling_game_consoles">making it the best-selling console ever</a>. (Though the Nintendo Switch will likely overtake it in the near future.) Over the course of the console’s lifecycle, thousands of PlayStation 2 games were released for it. Not all of them were great, but the machine does still indeed boast one of the <a href="https://kotaku.com/best-ps2-games-rare-playstation-console-sony-retro-1790020087">best console game libraries around</a>.</p>

 <p>To celebrate the console’s 25th birthday in America, <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/matpiscatella.bsky.social/post/3m44bjwl5n22h">Piscatella posted some fun stats about the PS2 on social media</a>. Did you know that the 8mb memory card was the PS2’s most sold accessory with a 61-percent attach rate? Overall, 147 million accessories were sold in the United States for the PS2. Wowza. And for those curious, here are the top 20 best-selling PlayStation 2 games of all time based on unit sales.</p> <p><strong>US Top 20 All-Time Best-Selling PS2 Games (Jan 1999 – Sep 2025)&nbsp;</strong></p> <ol> <li><em>Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas</em></li> <li><em>Grand Theft Auto: Vice City</em></li> <li><em>Grand Theft Auto III&nbsp;</em></li> <li><em>Guitar Hero III: Legends of Rock</em></li> <li><em>Gran Turismo 3: A-Spec</em></li> <li><em>Madden NFL 2005</em></li> <li><em>Guitar Hero II&nbsp;</em></li> <li><em>Madden NFL 2004</em></li> <li><em>Kingdom Hearts</em></li> <li><em>Madden NFL 2006</em></li> <li><em>Madden NFL 2007</em></li> <li><em>Jampack Series: PlayStation 2</em></li> <li><em>Madden NFL 2003</em></li> <li><em>Need for Speed: Underground&nbsp;</em></li> <li><em>Star Wars: Battlefront II</em></li> <li><em>Midnight Club 3: DUB Edition</em></li> <li><em>Final Fantasy X</em></li> <li><em>Gran Turismo 4: The Real Driving Simulator</em></li> <li><em>God of War</em></li> <li><em>Medal of Honor: Frontline</em></li> </ol> <p>While I expected the <em>GTA</em> games to top the chart, I was surprised to see <em>Medal of Honor: Frontline, Final Fantasy X,</em> and <em>God of War</em> crack the list, too. Also, wow, EA really was a force to be reckoned with back then, huh? What a different time for video games. Then again, <em>GTA</em> leading the pack hasn’t changed much in 2025, so I guess the more things change…</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/costco%E2%80%99s-1-year-membership-now-comes-with-a-digital-shop-card-that-almost-covers-the-cost-making-it-basically-free.1336000/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>When you get invited to an exclusive event, usually you’re the one who’s expected to come bearing gifts. But with Costco’s invitation to join their Gold Star club for just $65, which gets you a year of access to incredible savings across all of their huge array of departments, you’re the one receiving the gift in the form of a $40 gift card. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5025/">The invitation is waiting for you now at StackSocial.&nbsp;</a></p>
<p>If your one-stop shopping ambitions are even greater, so are the rewards. <strong>StackSocial is offering a year’s membership to Costco’s Executive Gold Star club, where you get all of the access and benefits of Gold Star membership plus a 2% annual reward on all of your purchases, for just $130</strong>. That one comes with a $60 gift card, so you get nearly half of your membership fee back instantly.</p>

<h2>Members Only</h2>
<p>A membership is the only way to get in the door at any of Costco’s 635 locations nationwide, but when the membership fee is marked down so significantly and delivered with a gift card to be used on your first shopping trip, it’s more than worth it. Whether you go in person or shop online, Costco is the ultimate in one-stop shopping, with everything from fresh groceries, meat, and fish to clothes for men, women, and kids, with literally hundreds of other goods and services in between.</p>
<p>A trip to Costco can replace your trips to the grocery store, big-box electronics store, hardware store, bakery, liquor store, drugstore, and more. Then, of course, there is the legendary Costco food court, where the $1.50 all-beef hot dog and 20 oz drink deal has not changed price in years. And before you gas up the car for your Costco trip, remember that Costco membership also gets you access to the dramatically reduced gas prices at Costco’s own pumps.</p>



<h2>More Than Merchandise</h2>
<p>Costco’s deals on merchandise and groceries are amazing, but so are their deals on services you wouldn’t normally associate with a shopping run. Costco’s automotive department has outstanding deals on tires and other services that are performed on-site, and there are also optometry and prescription departments ready to provide important personal health services at lower prices. Travel deals, check printing, free roadside assistance, auto insurance, water delivery — it’s no exaggeration to say that Costco has virtually any and everything you can think of.</p>
<p>But the only way to get in on all of these goods and services at fantastic prices is by having a membership. StackSocial’s deals for new members on a year of Gold Star membership for $65 or a year of Executive Gold Star membership for $130 await, <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5025/">as do the $40 (Gold Star) or $65 (Executive Gold Star) gift cards that automatically recoup much your first year’s fee.</a></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><span>Last time that the Department of Homeland Security used a video game property to try and recruit people to </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/portland-frog-costume-ice-facility-protest-oregon-trump-2000634001"><span>ICE</span></a><span>, it was with </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/department-homeland-security-ice-pokemon-song-video-2000627900"><span>a </span><i><span>Pokémon</span></i><span> video</span></a><span> in which they said they were going to “catch” undocumented people while the original anime’s theme song played over footage of ICE agents invading homes and arresting people. </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-responds-to-dhs-video-using-the-original-animes-theme-2000628222"><span>The Pokémon Company didn’t do anything about it</span></a><span>, so I guess whoever’s on the DHS’ social accounts is feeling brave enough to keep using video game imagery to try and promote ICE and recruit people to its cause, because it’s now using </span><i><span>Halo </span></i><span>imagery and language days after Halo Studios </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/halo-remake-campaign-evolved-playstation-cross-play-2000638951"><span>announced the original game is being remade and ported to PlayStation</span></a><span>.</span></p> <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">Finishing this fight. <a href="https://t.co/6Ezq9NUqMq">pic.twitter.com/6Ezq9NUqMq</a></p> <p>— Homeland Security (@DHSgov) <a href="https://twitter.com/DHSgov/status/1982819431894901043?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 27, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <p><span>The post on the DHS’ X account has an image of </span><i><span>Halo</span></i><span> characters on a Warthog with the subtitle “Finishing this fight,” a reference to the line from </span><i><span>Halo 2</span></i><span> in which protagonist Master Chief says he’s “finishing this fight” with the Covenant by blowing up their ship at the end of the sequel. The image itself has the text “Destroy the Flood,” which refers to a parasitic alien species that Master Chief and his friends fight throughout the series, just above a link to the ICE recruitment website. The rhetoric is not subtle.</span></p>

 <p><span>The replies are full of the same memetic bullshit you often see on such posts that shows some people view uprooting other people’s lives (or worse) as something to cheer for and encourage the way you might celebrate a sports team’s championship win. The broader context of the Trump Administration using Xbox and Microsoft’s imagery for a stupid recruitment ad, however, shows the rot runs much deeper. Notably, Microsoft has donated to Trump and his causes during his presidency, including the </span><a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/white-house/list-donors-trump-new-white-house-ballroom-east-wing-rcna239481"><span>ongoing demolition of the White House’s East Wing</span></a><span> and his </span><a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2025/01/09/microsoft-contributes-1-million-to-trumps-inauguration-fund.html"><span>inauguration fund</span></a><span>, likely to garner his support on issues like artificial intelligence. That’s not entirely surprising given the company’s political history, as Microsoft has reportedly made efforts to </span><a href="https://www.gamefile.news/p/microsofts-xbox-team-snaps-a-four"><span>erase its own diversity initiatives</span></a><span> and </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/bethesda-zenimax-roe-v-wade-abortion-politics-microsoft-1849134727"><span>inadequately responded to right-wing attacks on reproductive rights</span></a><span> in the eyes of some of its workers.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>The </span><i><span>Halo </span></i><span>post from DHS came just hours after GameStop and the Trump Administration went back and forth with console war memes </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/donald-trump-halo-gamestop-console-wars-meme-ai-images-2000639237"><span>that also used </span><i><span>Halo</span></i><span> characters</span></a><span>. We’ve reached out to Microsoft and Halo Studios for comment and will update this story if we hear back.</span></p>
