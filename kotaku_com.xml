We may still provide titles that can be playable on both PS4 and PS5 consoles after this date.”</p><p>In the meantime there are still several months of PS4 games coming to the service, with February’s newly revealed haul including the following, available to download between February 4 and March 3:</p><blockquote data-type="BlockQuote"><ul data-type="List" data-style="Bullet"><li><strong><em>Payday 3</em> | PS5</strong></li><li><strong><em>High on Life </em>| PS4, PS5</strong></li><li><strong><em>Pac-Man World Re-Pac</em> | PS4, PS5 </strong><br></li></ul></blockquote><p>Today’s announcement gives current PS4 owners a year’s notice to reconsider whether they want to renew their subscriptions even after the main perk of the service drops out for them. But PS4 players can still claim PS5 games and eventually download and play them once they do decide to make the jump to Sony’s newest hardware. That’s one of the benefits of the current PSN ecosystem: fans’ libraries should remain intact and compatible between console generations, including (hopefully) whenever the PS6 comes out. </p><p>PS Plus subscribers on PS4 had a pretty good run, starting in 2013 with the launch of the console and <em>Resogun</em>, through day-and-date indie releases like <em>Rocket League</em>, as well as blockbusters arriving long after release like the <em>Batman: Arkham trilogy</em>. It will have been 12 years and change by the time PS Plus moves on from PS4, and a similar length of time from when Sony stopped adding monthly PS3 games after the PS4 came out (which happened in February 2019).</p><p>But there are still many months to go of new PS4 games being given away on PS Plus. We’ll see if the console goes out with a bang.

Unfortunately, you still might have to spend some extra cash. <strong>The first thing you’ll need is a spare DisplayPort cable</strong> to connect your adapter to your graphics card. Yes, <strong>you <em>do </em>need to have your monitor and headset connected at the same time</strong>, so this isn’t a corner you can reasonably cut. </p><p>The second thing you might need is <strong>a supported Bluetooth dongle</strong>. We’ll get into this below, but some PSVR2 Adapter owners have reported needing <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.playstation.com/en-us/support/hardware/pc-ps-vr2-bluetooth/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.playstation.com/en-us/support/hardware/pc-ps-vr2-bluetooth/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">one of the Bluetooth dongles recommended by Sony</a></span> to get the smoothest performance possible. This will probably cost you about $20, though you can find lower prices if you shop at the right time.</p><p>Combined with the headset, this means <strong>you’ll need to spend between $60 and $90 in total to get your PlayStation VR2 headset to work on your computer</strong>. That’s much cheaper than buying a new headset just for your PC, but you’ll have to decide if that’s a price you’re willing to pay before you even drop cash on <em>Half-Life Alyx</em>.</p><h2 id="h1995"><a id="3"></a>Step 3: Set up your PlayStation VR2 Headset on your PC</h2><div><p>Once you have all the necessary components together, plug your adaptor into a power outlet and use your DisplayPort cable to plug the adaptor into your computer’s GPU (make sure you use the right slot!). Plug your headset into the adaptor, turn it on, and then open up Steam. </p></div><p>Next, find and download both <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://store.steampowered.com/app/2580190/PlayStationVR2_App/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2580190/PlayStationVR2_App/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">the PlayStation VR2 app</a></span> and <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://store.steampowered.com/app/250820/SteamVR/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/250820/SteamVR/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Steam VR</a></span>. Open the PlayStation VR2 App, and it’ll take you through instructions for connecting your controllers via Bluetooth. Follow the instructions, and then open the Steam VR app. If done correctly, you should see a window that looks like this when you hover your mouse over Steam VR on your taskbar.</p><figure id="" data-id="3d3807d4358e93ea3d71e9b45b9f97b6" data-recommend-id="image://3d3807d4358e93ea3d71e9b45b9f97b6" data-format="jpg" data-width="264" data-height="148" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A window for Steam VR that shows the PlayStation VR2 headset and accompanying controller icons lit up, which indicates they’re connected." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A window for Steam VR that shows the PlayStation VR2 headset and accompanying controller icons lit up, which indicates they’re connected." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Valve / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="3d3807d4358e93ea3d71e9b45b9f97b6" data-recommend-id="image://3d3807d4358e93ea3d71e9b45b9f97b6" data-format="jpg" data-width="264" data-height="148" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A window for Steam VR that shows the PlayStation VR2 headset and accompanying controller icons lit up, which indicates they’re connected." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>In my testing, it doesn’t seem like you need to launch the PlayStation VR2 app every time you want to use Steam VR after the initial setup. <strong>Make sure you turn on your headset whenever you want to use it</strong>, otherwise Steam won’t recognize either the device or the accompanying controllers.</p><h3 id="h1996"><a id=""></a>What if I can’t connect my PlayStation VR2 controllers to my PC via Bluetooth?</h3><p>Depending on your setup, you may run into a wall trying to get your VR controllers and your PC to get along. While frustrating, there are a few common culprits that lead to this issue. The first is that your motherboard in your computer may be missing a Wi-Fi antenna, which will weaken both your system’s Wi-Fi connection <em>and </em>its bandwidth for Bluetooth devices. <strong>If your PC came with an antenna that you just never screwed in, I strongly recommend setting that up</strong>. You’ll get a stronger wifi connection too!</p><p>The second common culprit is… well, computers are weird. Your controllers may not even show up in your Bluetooth menu because, I don’t know, your hardware is in a bad mood I guess? In this scenario, restart your computer and give the connection process another shot. </p><p>If your back is really against the wall and you just want to use your headset, <strong>I did find that plugging each controller directly into my computer works</strong>. This of course relies on you having two USB-A to USB-C cords hanging around, but if you own a PS5 and PSVR2 headset, you should have two to work with. I’d only label this a temporary fix, as all the wires will make any game with motion controls cumbersome at best and dangerous at worst. But for games that only require basic pointing and shooting, this setup can work.</p><p><strong>If you have any persistent connection issues, or the controllers just aren’t responsive enough, I recommend looking into </strong><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.playstation.com/en-us/support/hardware/pc-ps-vr2-bluetooth/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.playstation.com/en-us/support/hardware/pc-ps-vr2-bluetooth/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>one of those Sony approved dongles</strong></a></span>. The adapter probably should have come with one of these to save you the headache, but them’s the breaks.</p><h2 id="h1997"><a id="4"></a>Step 4: Enjoy your VR Headset!</h2><p>It’s certainly inconvenient to have to spend extra money on accessories to get this headset to work, and the Bluetooth connection issues can become a hassle if you’re not one who likes to tinker. But after jumping through the initial hurdles, I found PlayStation VR2 works pretty well on PC. It’s relatively easy to pick up and play, and the OLED screen looks great, too. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://store.steampowered.com/app/2580190/PlayStationVR2_App/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2580190/PlayStationVR2_App/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Steam reviews</a></span> indicate that some folks deal with software crashing and other glitches while using it, and you should be aware that those reports exist. That said, that hasn’t been my experience so far.</p><p>Despite a good experience when it’s all up and running, I wouldn’t recommend investing in PlayStation VR2 if your primary use case is PC VR gaming. If nothing else, the PlayStation VR2’s relative scarcity means its less supported than more widely-adopted alternatives like the Meta Quest, so there’s no guarantee that future games will be made with the PlayStation headset in mind. Additionally, some of the neatest features of the headset—such as eye tracking and HDR—aren’t supported by the PC adapter. But as long as you know all that going in, the PC adapter does its job and gives you access to Steam’s robust ecosystem of VR games. Let’s just hope that Sony actually makes more of these things so you can actually purchase one!</p><p>.<br></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

This will ensure that the longer you use the Focus ability, which gives you valuable intel about enemies nearby, the longer it’ll take before it wears off.

Given how lethal bullets can be in <em>Resistance,</em> this is helpful for obvious reasons. You can buy “Health Boost 2” afterward to increase your total health bars to six.</p><h2 id="h771"><a id="recovery"></a>Speedy Recovery</h2><p>“Speedy Recovery” can be purchased from the Body tree after you unlock “Maintain Focus.” This lets your health regenerate more quickly after taking damage. Considering how easy it can be to get overwhelmed when things go wrong in <em>Sniper Elite: Resistance</em>, being able to duck behind some cover and begin rapid health regeneration is invaluable.</p><h2 id="h772"><a id="fight"></a>Back in the Fight</h2><p>“Back in the Fight” is the first skill in the Combat tree. Grab this early on, as it essentially acts as an extra life if you get downed—as long as you have a Med Kit on hand, at least. When you’re down, just quickly use a Med Kit to get a second chance at survival. </p><h2 id="h773"><a id="ammo"></a>Scavenge Weapon Ammo</h2><p>“Scavenge Weapon Ammo” is the first skill in the Equipment tree. You’ll want to snag this one to ensure you always have ample ammo for any situation.

Doing this discards the enemy’s gun, though, so only use this option when you’re not interested in grabbing their weapon.</p><hr><p><em>Sniper Elite: Resistance</em> is available now on PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Xbox One, Xbox Series X, and PC.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
