For brothers who literally gained international notoriety by broadcasting every minute detail of their lives for years, I’m not sure a reality series is something anyone has been waiting a decade for. </p><p>With such an announcement, you’d expect the promo machine to already be in overdrive.

In the interview, she admits her character has an “odd relationship with Pedro’s character” before explaining how their weird dynamic can bring out some great humor. </p><p>“She’s got this edge to her, but it makes for some weird, good dark comedy, I think. So it’s there. I never want to deny the gift of humor.”</p><p>The second season of <em>The Last of Us</em> picks up five years after the events of the first season, which could explain why Joel needs to get a lot off of his chest. In the teaser, O’Hara’s character shares insightful messages that could double as interrogation tactics. She’s heard saying, “You can’t heal something unless you’re brave enough to say it out loud.” She also urges him to “say the thing you’re afraid to say.” By the end of the trailer, tears are dripping from Joel’s eyes. So, where in the world would she fit humor in?</p><p>If anyone can find laughs in the morbid, it’s the woman who played the eccentric Delia Deetz in both <em>Beetlejuice</em> movies, and previously proved herself as a versatile comedy virtuoso on the sketch comedy show <em>SCTV</em>. Time may have broken Joel’s funny bone, but it’s going to be thrilling to watch O’Hara’s character try to find the humor in the horror when <em>The Last of Us </em>Season 2 premieres in April. <br></p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
