This shouldn’t come as too big of a surprise for anyone familiar with HBO’s ratings goldmine.

The first season of <em>The Last of Us</em> also saw an unprecedented ratings increase with each episode, with the season finale gaining a 74 percent bump in viewers compared to the first episode. That could absolutely be the case for this season, given what we can expect from the upcoming episodes. </p><p>While the second season won’t cover the entire story of <em>The Last of Us Part II </em>video game, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/last-of-us-season-2-hbo-max-show-review-joel-ellie-abby-1851774661&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/last-of-us-season-2-hbo-max-show-review-joel-ellie-abby-1851774661">our review of the season</a></span> promises gripping scenes from the incredible Jeffrey Wright as Isaac Dixon. The trailer hints at Ellie confronting Joel about lying to her at the end of the first season, and the premiere already introduced the idea of infected humans now being more strategic and less blindly bloodthirsty. That’s more than enough mayhem and heartbreak to make this season appointment viewing.<br></p><p>Is this season as engrossing and morally complex as <em>The Last of Us Part II</em>? No. Will it still be one of the most watched shows of 2025? That’s as certain as a whisper leading to death by a Clicker.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

The always-helpful Armorcharm and Powercharm have also returned, but they’re easy to miss this time around. You’ll want to get these as soon as possible to have that extra edge for tough hunts.</p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="196411" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="A Typical Day On Persona 3 Reload’s Tatsumi Port Island" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="378" data-playlist="196411,196805,196055" data-current="196411"><div><p>A Typical Day On Persona 3 Reload’s Tatsumi Port Island</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196411/196411_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196411/196411_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196411/196411_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196411/196411_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/21958.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><h2 id="h26363"><a id=""></a>How to Get Armorcharm</h2><p>Unlike previous games, both of these items are earned as quest rewards instead of as products to buy from a merchant. What’s tricky is that they’re earned from side quests that won’t be available until you unlock High Rank. <strong>You can get the Armorcharm first by completing the “Secure Wounded Hollow” optional quest from Cobb in the Suja location.</strong> He’ll either be at your tent or right next to it with Gemma.</p><p>This quest involves hunting two Hirabami monsters inside the Wounded Hollow area. Bringing a ranged weapon like the <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/monster-hunter-wild-heavy-light-bowgun-differences-best-1851773364&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/monster-hunter-wild-heavy-light-bowgun-differences-best-1851773364">Bowguns</a></span> will serve you well in hitting these typically flying monsters. Having something that can trigger an <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/monster-hunter-wilds-offset-attack-monster-weapons-1851775743&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/monster-hunter-wilds-offset-attack-monster-weapons-1851775743">offset attack</a></span> can also be useful for occasionally knocking it down to the ground. The two most important things I recommend doing are taking advantage of their elemental weaknesses (Fire and Thunder) and using the levers on the sides of the arena to trigger a large fence that divides the area in half. With the right timing, this can separate the monsters for a little bit and let you focus on them one at a time.</p><p>Return to Suja and talk to Cobb once you’re done looting the Hirabami. He’ll give you the Armorcharm, which will go into your item box. If you completed this quest before Title Update 1 and encountered a glitch where you didn’t receive the item, you can properly earn it by finishing any Arena Quest at the Grand Hub.</p><h2 id="h26364"><a id=""></a>How to Get Powercharm</h2><p>Your chance to get the Powercharm will come a little bit later. You’ll need to have completed the quest mentioned above and raised your hunter rank further. <strong>The Powercharm is available as a reward for completing the “As Gatekeeper” quest from Rex in Suja.</strong> He’ll be in the same areas that Cobb patrols.</p><p>This is another hunt involving two monsters in Wounded Hollow. But this time, it’s against two Ajarakan. These things can be super aggressive and might be easier if you team up with another player for a <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/monster-hunter-wilds-co-op-lobby-link-party-id-1851771071&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/monster-hunter-wilds-co-op-lobby-link-party-id-1851771071">multiplayer hunt</a></span>. Aside from bringing something that can inflict Water Element damage, separating them with the large fence is still a must. Between their huge attacks and power-up state, taking on both at the same time is a recipe for disaster. Consider bringing a weapon you can guard with to ease up on the constant dodging and potentially trigger a <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/monster-hunter-wilds-power-clash-explained-guarding-1851775741&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/monster-hunter-wilds-power-clash-explained-guarding-1851775741">power clash</a></span>.</p><p>Return to Rex once you’re finished to receive the Powercharm. Just like its armor counterpart, this will go straight into your item box. Another similarity is that on the off chance that a glitch prevented you from unlocking it, finishing any Arena quest will give it to you.</p><h2 id="h26365"><a id=""></a>How to Use the Armorcharm and Powercharm</h2><figure id="" data-id="c6922733690ebf12c6d916319793c30a" data-recommend-id="image://c6922733690ebf12c6d916319793c30a" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The Transfer Items screen, with the Powercharm highlighted in the Item Box.

These aren’t even equipment per se–they’re just items with a unique activation method. <strong>As long as they’re in your Item Pouch, the Armorcharm and Powercharm will respectively provide +12 defense and +6 attack.</strong> They don’t have any special icons, so it could be easy to skip over them while trying to find them. Thankfully, they’re listed on the first page of your item box alongside most of your healing items.</p><p>Losing out on one or two spots in your pouch is a small price to pay for some additional buffs.
