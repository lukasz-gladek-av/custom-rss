              <p>Four months after the former head of <em>Assassin’s Creed</em> abruptly exited the company <a href="https://kotaku.com/assassins-creed-lawsuit-ubisoft-marc-alexis-cote-hexe-2000660833">after allegedly being forced out</a>, Ubisoft has tapped three veterans of the series who have worked on or led entries like <em>Origins, Black Flag, </em>and <em>Revelations </em>to take charge of the franchise inside its new Tencent-backed home at Vantage Studios.</p> <p>On February 23, <a href="https://news.ubisoft.com/en-us/article/3cKfpuehIapKJglmjn3EdM/new-leadership-team-set-to-shape-the-next-era-of-assassins-creed">Ubisoft announced</a> that Martin Schelling, Jean Guesdon, and François de Billy are being handed the keys to <em>Assassin’s Creed</em>, the French publisher’s very successful and long-running historical-based open-world stealth action franchise. These three have been connected with <em>Assassin’s Creed</em> for many, many years and have been involved in some of the franchise’s most popular games.</p>

 <p>Schelling is now the head of the<em> Assassin’s Creed</em> brand. Ubisoft says he’ll be responsible for the “overall strategy and long-term vision” of the series. Previously, he was Ubisoft’s chief production officer after spending 17 years in various production roles on games like<em> Assassin’s Creed Revelations, Black Flag, Origins, </em>and <em>Valhalla.</em></p> <p>François de Billy has been named <em>Assassin’s Creed</em>‘ “Head of Production Excellence,” which is a wild title to put on a resume. François was the production director on <em>Assassin’s Creed Black Flag, Origins, </em>and <em>Valhalla.</em> Before that, he was an associate producer on <em>Assassin’s Creed 2</em> and later an executive producer of the brand. Ubisoft says that in this role he will “optimize processes and remove friction across complex production workflows” for the franchise. Sounds like François de Billy is here to help the series avoid delays.</p>

 <p>Finally, Jean Guesdon has been named the head of content for <em>Assassin’s Creed</em>. He’ll lead the franchise’s “overall creative direction” while supporting “individual games” and guiding the “future of <em>Assassin’s Creed</em>.” Previously, Guesdon was the creative director on <em>Assassin’s Creed Black Flag</em> and <em>Origins</em>. Interestingly, this is essentially the same role he had at Ubisoft for many years while working on numerous titles.</p>

 <p>He previously left Ubisoft for Behaviour Interactive back in 2023. At the time, <a href="https://kotaku.com/assassins-creed-black-flag-origins-minecraft-ubisoft-1850095545"><em>Kotaku</em> reported</a> he had been leading development on a new, <em>Minecraft</em>-like voxel-based game called “Renaissance” that had yet to be announced. It was described by sources back then as being one of the more promising IPs incubating within Ubisoft at the time, with the possibility of appealing to existing fans of franchises like<em> The Sims</em> and <em>Animal Crossing</em>. But it later became <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20250602045705/https://mp1st.com/news/report-inside-ubisofts-project-renaissance-a-cancelled-minecraft-like-voxel-game">a casualty of Ubisoft’s ongoing development struggles</a>, especially around creating new IP.</p> <h2>Ubisoft has multiple <em>Assassin’s Creed</em> games in development</h2> <p>Schelling, de Billy, and Guesdon are now set to fill a void created by recent departures, including Marc-Alexis Côté’s break with the company in 2025 after leading <em>Assassin’s Creed</em> for nearly 20 years. He is <a href="https://kotaku.com/former-assassins-creed-boss-says-he-didnt-jump-ubisoft-pushed-2000636542">suing the publisher for a forced dismissal</a>, but Ubisoft claims he was offered a leadership role at Vantage Studios and declined it.</p>

 <p>It is very clear that Ubisoft leadership wants to ensure that arguably its biggest, most important franchise continues to be popular and grow. In recent years, the series has struggled to tell a larger meta-narrative and ship on time. There have also been plans to intertwine future installments as part of a larger initiative, but those plans have so far seemed half-baked. 2025’s <em>Assassin’s Creed Shadows</em> was a big hit for Ubisoft, helping keep the company afloat as it <a href="https://kotaku.com/ubisoft-earnings-layoffs-delays-canceled-ai-2000661869">limped towards a massive buyout with Tencent.</a></p> <p>The ramifications of that deal have been lots of layoffs and cancelled projects. It has also created new co-owned subsidiaries, like Vantage Studios, that are now in charge of Ubisoft’s big franchises like <em>Rainbow Six </em>and <em>Assassin’s Creed</em>. In a recent <a href="https://variety.com/2026/gaming/news/ubisoft-ceo-interview-yves-guillemot-layoffs-creative-house-1236667500/">interview with <em>Variety</em></a>, Ubisoft boss Yves Guillemot said there are multiple <em>Assassin’s Creed</em> games, including both multiplayer and single-player titles, currently in development. One of those is the<a href="https://kotaku.com/assassin-s-creed-4-black-flag-remake-skull-bones-1850596271"> previously reported <em>Black Flag</em> remake</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><i><span>Pokémon FireRed </span></i><span>and </span><i><span>LeafGreen </span></i><span>are </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-fire-red-leaf-green-switch-pokemon-direct-price-2000671938"><span>getting Switch ports on Friday, February 27</span></a><span>. The 22-year-old Game Boy Advance remakes are widely considered the “definitive” editions of the original games thanks to quality-of-life changes and added areas and quest lines. The games aren’t readily available right now, so you’d think this announcement would have been met with universal excitement. But that wasn’t the case, as the $20 ports were deemed too expensive by some. Nevertheless, the games are </span><a href="https://www.nintendo.com/en-gb/Nintendo-eShop/Charts/Nintendo-eShop-charts-1396788.html"><span>topping the eShop charts</span></a><span> already.</span></p> <p><span>I gotta admit, I do find the pearl clutching about the $20 price tag a bit surprising, but in my experience, it’s impossible to have discussions about video game pricing because everyone’s perception of what a dollar is worth is so different. As the </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/game-pricing-indie-steam-peak-content-warning-2000658886"><i><span>Peak </span></i><span>devs explained</span></a><span>, video game pricing is all weird, vibes-based psychology that some companies have figured out and others just kind of ignore.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><span>$20 is what you might pay for a nice meal that you’ll eat and then forget about, and here it gets you a 30+-hour game. But hey, I don’t know your economic situation, so I can’t speak to what $20 in your bank account means. I’m not here to judge anyone’s perception of money, I’m more concerned about how these conversations don’t seem to take that economic disparity into account.</span></p> <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">i lowkey dgaf them pokemon game ports cost 20 dollars i have a job why should i care</p> <p>— lil (@adifying) <a href="https://twitter.com/adifying/status/2024824271076233711?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">February 20, 2026</a></p></blockquote>  <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="qst" dir="ltr">lol <a href="https://t.co/L4e7BSIGOL">https://t.co/L4e7BSIGOL</a></p> <p>— TAHK0 ☕️ (@TAHK0) <a href="https://twitter.com/TAHK0/status/2025167322160529765?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">February 21, 2026</a></p></blockquote>  <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">How are both sides of this argument so fucking annoying <a href="https://t.co/moOgMlk9tT">https://t.co/moOgMlk9tT</a></p> <p>— Lost Levels Fan (@LostLevelsFan) <a href="https://twitter.com/LostLevelsFan/status/2025016667923730885?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">February 21, 2026</a></p></blockquote>  <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">whispers: *i actually think $20 for firered is pretty reasonable* 😬</p> <p>— Bob Wulff (@BobWulff) <a href="https://twitter.com/BobWulff/status/2024920916556185689?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">February 20, 2026</a></p></blockquote>  <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">This is literally all you are getting with Pokémon Fire Red and Pokémon Leaf Green.</p> <p>No changes, no online support.</p> <p>This is easily emulated on extremely low powered machines.</p> <p>$20 for a 20 year old Rom and Emulator is a wild price, buy what you want but don't defend it please. <a href="https://t.co/l3OfqiUz00">pic.twitter.com/l3OfqiUz00</a></p> <p>— Protomario (@Protomario) <a href="https://twitter.com/Protomario/status/2025614936450150869?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">February 22, 2026</a></p></blockquote>  <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">People would have complained if FireRed and LeafGreen was put on NSO because they would have wanted to buy it separately. </p> <p>Even if they were $5, people still would have complained.</p> <p>Free or nothing</p> <p>— Johniibo (@johniibo) <a href="https://twitter.com/johniibo/status/2025702770762793441?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">February 22, 2026</a></p></blockquote>  <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">Pokemon Fire Red costs 13 Costco hot dogs.</p> <p>Hard decisions man.</p> <p>— Pory (@pory_leeks) <a href="https://twitter.com/pory_leeks/status/2025737366540009950?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">February 23, 2026</a></p></blockquote>  <p><span>I remember once talking to someone about the </span><i><span>Mass Effect: Legendary Edition </span></i><span>remasters, and they flatly said the collection’s $60 price point placed it out of their budget…but $50? That could be the sweet spot. A mere $10 could be the difference between them playing some of their favorite games again on modern hardware and not doing so.</span></p>

 <p><i><span>FireRed </span></i><span>and </span><i><span>LeafGreen </span></i><span>were $40 when they launched in 2004, but now if they’re anything short of free on Nintendo Switch Online, it’s the type of greed they talk about in the Bible. The irreconcilable way conflicting people talk about video game prices is born from those economic discrepancies, not everyone makes the same money, but also some people will just view any old game that costs money as a ripoff. It’s an unwinnable, unsolvable problem because everyone’s economic background is different, influenced by factors beyond their control, and is all based in a society that is wringing every cent out of all of us at any given moment. But that truth won’t stop the arguments from continuing, with anyone willing to pay $20 for an old game being deemed a shill and anyone unwilling being called poor. Whatever the case, many people are clearly willing to pay $20 to go back to Kanto again.</span></p>
