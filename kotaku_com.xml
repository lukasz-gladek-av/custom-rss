              <p>Larian Studios CEO Swen Vincke has now shared more details about how the acclaimed RPG studio will be approaching the use of generative AI tools for developing its next game, <a href="https://kotaku.com/divinity-turn-based-rpg-larian-studios-early-access-date-2000653845"><em>Divinity</em></a>. Speaking to fans in an AMA on Reddit, the director walked back a previous statement that Larian would use generative AI to help with references for concept art, but did say that <em>Divinity</em> could include gen-AI assets in the finished game as long as the studio is “100 percent sure about the origins of the training data and the consent of those who created the data.”</p> <p>The gaming veteran landed in hot water last month <a href="https://kotaku.com/larian-gen-ai-divinity-baldurs-gate-3-rpg-2000653912">over comments in an interview with<em> Bloomberg</em></a> about how Larian was experimenting with AI tools in the production of its next game, including generating references for concept art, producing PowerPoints, and other early production work that could help speed up the prototyping trial and error phase. At the same time, the CEO doubled down on the idea that no AI elements would appear in the finished game and stated that the studio wasn’t turning to the controversial tools to try and cut its headcount.</p>

 <p>In today’s AMA, which was promised in response to the prior backlash, Vincke said that AI will no longer be used at all in the concept art phase, but did suggest the studio is looking at ways to use gen-AI tools trained exclusively on the company’s own material. Here’s his <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Games/comments/1q870w5/comment/nyl9tdz/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button">full statement</a>:</p>

 <blockquote><p>So first off – there is not going to be any GenAI art in Divinity.</p> <p>I know there’s been a lot of discussion about us using AI tools as part of concept art exploration. We already said this doesn’t mean the actual concept art is generated by AI but we understand it created confusion.</p> <p>So, to ensure there is no room for doubt, we’ve decided to refrain from using genAI tools during concept art development.</p> <p>That way there can be no discussion about the origin of the art.</p> <p>Having said that, we continuously try to improve the speed with which we can try things out. The more iterations we can do, the better in general the gameplay is.</p> <p>We think GenAI can help with this and so we’re trying things out across departments. Our hope is that it can aid us to refine ideas faster, leading to a more focused development cycle, less waste, and ultimately, a higher-quality game.</p> <p>The important bit to note is that we will not generate “creative assets” that end up in a game without being 100% sure about the origins of the training data and the consent of those who created the data. If we use a GenAI model to create in-game assets, then it’ll be trained on data we own.</p></blockquote> <p>Larian’s new position addresses two of the chief criticisms of generative AI tools. The first is that they’re used by companies to undercut and replace human creatives. The second is that they produce content stolen from the millions of people whose work they were trained on. A set of gen AI tools trained entirely on Larian’s own proprietary game assets could potentially side-step that second critique, though it also suggests that <em>Divinity</em> could include at least some assets that were generated with the help of AI.</p>

 <p>Developers have long used machine learning and procedural generation to help create pieces of a game that humans can then go and tweak as needed. It would be impossible to craft the beautiful cosmos of <em>No Man’s Sky</em> by hand. The bulk of its universe is generated from algorithms designed by the team at Hello Games. But as technology advances, algorithms have been able to produce more and more of the stuff that players might find in a finished game, leading many fans to balk at things like sloppy gen-AI loading screen art and even at the use of algorithms to generate spoken performances for NPCs, a subject of some controversy for <em>Arc Raiders</em>.</p>

              <p>Following <a href="https://kotaku.com/arc-raiders-cheaters-ninja-shroud-embark-patch-2000657708">a number of high-profile streamers stating they had had enough of a new plague of cheating</a> in extraction shooter hit&nbsp;<em>Arc Raiders</em>, developers Embark have responded with word that “significant changes” are coming to try to address the issues.</p> <p>Posting to the official Discord for the game, Embark’s community lead OssenJ assured players that the developer was aware of the conversation, and “taking this issue very seriously.” Assuring that feedback was being heard, she continues, “Over the next few weeks, we are implementing significant changes to our rulesets and deploying new detection mechanisms to identify and remove cheaters.”</p>

 <p>It seems Embark was a little slow in responding to the growth of cheating due to much of the team being away for winter vacation, and having to play catch-up on their return. However, with everyone back hopefully things will start changing. The plans include “updating our Anti-Cheat systems for improved detection and bans,” and speaking directly to one of the main sources of complaint, “applying client-side fixes specifically addressing the ‘out of map’ glitch.” There are also plans to bring in measures and tools for streamers to “help mitigate stream sniping”—the issue where players can see where streamers are on a map and what they’re doing, and using this to the sniper’s advantage.</p>

 <figure id="attachment_2000658426" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000658426"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000658426">© Discord / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p>It’s not clear if these measures will be enough to address the concerns of some of those who’ve previously spoken out. Alongside the likes of Ninja and Shroud yelling at Embark to improve things, Nadeshot argued that the only hope he sees is for the studio to put into practice the tactics of Epic, where legal action is threatened (and carried out) against those who supply cheating software and aids. Others pointed out Epic is a multi-billion dollar company with the <em>Fortnite</em> infinite money machine, whereas Embark is a small-ish Swedish developer on their second game. However, Embark is a subsidiary of Korean firm Nexon, which itself is worth around $20 billion, so it’s not&nbsp;<em>impossible</em>.</p>

 <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">My experience on Arc Raiders over the last week has been hell. Just to be clear, I love this game and think it’s already moved in to my personal top 10 all time.</p> <p>But the egregious amount of cheating genuinely might be worse than peak Call of Duty. I’m not trying to bring…</p> <p>— 100T Nadeshot (@Nadeshot) <a href="https://twitter.com/Nadeshot/status/2007926647295492467?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 4, 2026</a></p></blockquote>  <p>Given the anti-cheating measures are due “over the next few weeks,” we won’t immediately know how much improvement they bring. And for the less violent players, it’s likely you are being matchmade with other PvE-orientated players, and as such completely avoiding any cheating altogether.</p>
