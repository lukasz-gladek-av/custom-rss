What feedback might someone who was just laid off at Halo Studios or Undead Labs give at the ID@Xbox roundtable? “Please give me my job back”? “Don’t replace us with AI”?</p><p>There’s also the growing fear that generative AI will drastically upend game development as an art and profession by giving managers new ways to potentially cut costs and remove the most important but unpredictable variable from the equation: people.

That makes attempts to shoehorn it into Xbox—whether through hallucinating gameplay prototypes or efforts to solve backwards compatibility woes—come off as particularly out of touch.
