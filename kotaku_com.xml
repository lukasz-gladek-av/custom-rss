After 20 years of fans hoping for this day, it’s finally here as part of Cena’s retirement tour leading up to his final WrestleMania in April. </p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="197298" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="Live Forever in the Universe of 'New World: Aeternum'" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="108" data-playlist="197298,197284,197260" data-current="197298"><div><p>Live Forever in the Universe of 'New World: Aeternum'</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197298/197298_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197298/197298_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197298/197298_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197298/197298_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"></video></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>First, just so everyone understands what happened, a little history: John Cena has been wrestling in the WWE since 2001. At first he portrayed a rapping villain. Over time he became very popular, and in 2005—after winning his first WWE Championship—he became a babyface aka a good guy in all future storylines and events. And for the last 20 years, as he granted over 600 kids their dreams as part of the Make-A-Wish foundation and became a movie star, he’s remained a babyface despite many wrestling fans wishing he’d turn heel aka become a bad guy again. But with each passing year, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/SquaredCircle/comments/1j2de7s/john_cena_heel_turn_after_he_won_the_wwe/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/SquaredCircle/comments/1j2de7s/john_cena_heel_turn_after_he_won_the_wwe/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">and as Cena himself joked</a></span> about it, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/john-cena-retirement-tour-wwe-cody-rhodes-the-rock-1851732028/slides/2#:~:text=To%20properly%20execute,his%20inner%20villain.&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/john-cena-retirement-tour-wwe-cody-rhodes-the-rock-1851732028/slides/2#:~:text=To%20properly%20execute,his%20inner%20villain.">it became more and more unlikely that the face of the WWE brand would ever be a villain again</a></span>. And then that changed over the weekend. </p><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://bleacherreport.com/articles/25165900-john-cenas-legendary-heel-turn-just-changed-everything-wwe-wrestlemania-41&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://bleacherreport.com/articles/25165900-john-cenas-legendary-heel-turn-just-changed-everything-wwe-wrestlemania-41" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">On March 1</a></span>, at the end of <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elimination_Chamber:_Toronto#Main_event&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elimination_Chamber:_Toronto#Main_event" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">WWE’s Elimination Chamber: Toronto event</a></span>, Cena won the whole thing and was given a championship match against current champ and babyface Cody Rhodes at WrestleMania 41 in April. But after winning, Rhodes entered the ring and stared Cena down. </p><p>Then the Rock showed up and explained how Rhodes needed to team up with him and give him everything including “his soul.” Rhodes said no and then embraced Cena. But that was when Cena signaled to Rock that he was willing to make that deal, and the soon-to-be-retiring wrestler attacked Rhodes signaling his heel turn. The moment received one of the loudest crowd pops I’ve ever heard as people lost their mind watching Cena finally go bad. <br></p><p>After the historic heel turn, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.instagram.com/p/DGsPKjOOB5k/?utm_source=ig_embed&amp;ig_rid=cd7d9aad-33e3-4f7b-9cfb-b8b19950384e&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.instagram.com/p/DGsPKjOOB5k/?utm_source=ig_embed&amp;ig_rid=cd7d9aad-33e3-4f7b-9cfb-b8b19950384e" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Cena posted an image of <em>Grand Theft Auto 6</em> on Instagram</a></span>, a reference to the meme that we have received so many long awaited things before Rockstar’s open-world sequel. Meanwhile, wrestling fans have started doing what they always do in these moments: Speculate on what will happen next, get excited about the next big event, and explain how actually this wasn’t surprising at all because they saw it coming. </p><p>Regardless of all that, Cena turning heel in the final weeks of his WWE career as he enters his last WrestleMania to face one of the company’s biggest new good guys, Cody Rhodes, feels like a exciting end to one of the greatest wrestling careers of the century. Will he turn back to babyface at the very end? Will he win it all? Will he go out a villain? We’ll have to wait until April to find out, but even I, someone who barely watches wrestling, am excited to see how it all plays out. </p><p> .<br></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Two things rubbed players the wrong way about this. </p><p>The first was seemingly locking a cool in-game cosmetic behind a timed-event, leveraging FOMO (fear of missing out) to make fans play the game in an arbitrary way during an arbitrary time period. The second was that both the progress meter for the event and unlocking the cosmetic were busted. </p><p>“This is some of the worst implemented ‘rewards’ system I have ever seen! I played my 6 games of each class on ruthless yesterday, then play some regular lethals while I waited for it to update,” one player <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/Spacemarine/comments/1iwk0ji/never_do_this_again/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Spacemarine/comments/1iwk0ji/never_do_this_again/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">posted</a></span> on the<em> Space Marine</em> subreddit early on during the event. “Hours later it said 3/6 so I ran through all 6 again on substantial then went to bed. When I woke up it said 4/6 and now having run all 6 again it’s still on 4/6! I have played a minimum of 21 games in the past 24 hours 18 of them focused on getting this damn helm!”</p><p>Many others <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/Spacemarine/comments/1ixfas6/this_event_was_sponsored_by_nurgle/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Spacemarine/comments/1ixfas6/this_event_was_sponsored_by_nurgle/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">were struggling too</a></span>. The event had to be twice taken offline for fixes, narrowing the 10 day window for it even further. Plus, the whole appeal of <em>Space Marine 2</em> is that it’s not a game you have to constantly keep up with like a second job. In a world of <em>Destiny</em>s,<em> Apex Legendses</em>, and <em>Fortnite</em>s, it’s one of the rare online multiplayer shooters where you can log on, have some fun, and then forget about it for a while. Unless you were trying to get the Mark VIII Errant Helmet or other recent event-gated cosmetics. </p><p>“We have noted that the Community Events have received cold feedback since we introduced them as an additional way to unlock cosmetic items,” <em>Space Marine 2</em>'s developers at Saber Interactive <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://community.focus-entmt.com/focus-entertainment/space-marine-2/blogs/166-february-community-update&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://community.focus-entmt.com/focus-entertainment/space-marine-2/blogs/166-february-community-update" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">wrote</a></span> on February 28. “We saw that many of you mentioned FOMO generated by the events.

We deeply apologize for the trouble, and are currently working on a simplified process to unlock the items, to make the experience less constraining.</p></blockquote><p>So in addition to having community events run more smoothly in the future, Saber also confirmed that their rewards will eventually be circulated into the game for everyone else regardless of whether they were around to participate in the original event or not. It’s unclear if this was always the plan or only something the development team arrived at after the recent Imperial Vigil train wreck. But given the Live-Service Lite™ nature of <em>Space Marine 2</em>, players will be more eager to know when the game’s next major content update and first story DLC will arrive. <br></p><p>The developers also <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://community.focus-entmt.com/focus-entertainment/space-marine-2/blogs/166-february-community-update&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://community.focus-entmt.com/focus-entertainment/space-marine-2/blogs/166-february-community-update" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">recently confirmed</a></span> that a big 7.0 patch is on the way and teased what players can expect from<em> Space Marine 2</em>'s long-awaited Horde mode. “You’re very eager to get more info on the Horde Mode, it’s one of our top priorities right now,” they confirmed. “One thing we can say is that it will be very different from the <em>Space Marine 1</em> Horde Mode, and that there are surprises we can’t wait for you to find out about.”</p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

That all changed over the weekend as concept art for <em>Avengers: Doomsday </em>has reportedly leaked, illustrating some of the franchise’s disparate heroes finally coming together. It may also give us hints about the film’s story, which seems to be a deviation from the typical cataclysmic MCU crossover. If you want to see the art and speculation about what it all means, read on.</p><p>The concept art was originally posted on ArtStation by user noirmutaon and has since been <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://noirmutaon.artstation.com/projects/lGN6A5?album_id=1347230&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://noirmutaon.artstation.com/projects/lGN6A5?album_id=1347230" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">deleted from the art hosting site</a></span>. The account belongs to Mushk Rizvi, a senior concept artist at Marvel Studios. Though the post has been scrapped from the site, fans have already spread the art and begun dissecting what it tells us about <em>Doomsday</em>. Let’s go piece by piece and break it down.</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="5ca2284893e2a7780c237fd7210fd7b5" data-recommend-id="image://5ca2284893e2a7780c237fd7210fd7b5" data-format="jpg" data-width="2048" data-height="1164" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Star-Lord and White Vision sitting on a couch with beer and pizza on the table in front of them." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Star-Lord and White Vision sitting on a couch with beer and pizza on the table in front of them." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Marvel</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="5ca2284893e2a7780c237fd7210fd7b5" data-recommend-id="image://5ca2284893e2a7780c237fd7210fd7b5" data-format="jpg" data-width="2048" data-height="1164" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Star-Lord and White Vision sitting on a couch with beer and pizza on the table in front of them." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Some of the art feels incomprehensible right now because it features characters we’ve not seen interact at all. One includes Chris Pratt’s Star-Lord, having returned to Earth after the end of <em>Guardians of the Galaxy, Vol. 3</em>, hanging out on the couch with White Vision, who has been absent from the MCU since his “creation” at the end of <em>WandaVision</em>. White Vision, having come to an understanding with the original Vision, flew away from all the chaos of Westview and we haven’t seen him since. Apparently, at some phase of <em>Doomsday</em>’s development at least, he and Star-Lord were quite chummy and watching TV with beers and pizza. Until Marvel says otherwise, I’m choosing to believe they’re boyfriends. Star-Lord is bisexual in the comics, so fuck it. They’re boyfriends cuddling on the couch.</p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="7fd76325c6a9f4a02e90606f51398c67" data-recommend-id="image://7fd76325c6a9f4a02e90606f51398c67" data-format="jpg" data-width="3840" data-height="1560" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Star-Lord, Wong, and the Young Avengers are shown speaking around a table." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Star-Lord, Wong, and the Young Avengers are shown speaking around a table." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="false" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Marvel</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="7fd76325c6a9f4a02e90606f51398c67" data-recommend-id="image://7fd76325c6a9f4a02e90606f51398c67" data-format="jpg" data-width="3840" data-height="1560" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Star-Lord, Wong, and the Young Avengers are shown speaking around a table." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Jokes aside, Star-Lord does seem to be playing a significant role in the movie, as shown in the art of him and sorcerer Wong chatting with members of what fans believe to be the Young Avengers. Members include Wiccan, Stature, Hawkeye, what appears to be Speed, and Ms. Marvel being her usual fangirling self. It looks like Star-Lord and Wong are mentoring the kids in some way, probably briefing them on a mission. Fans have noted that the roster is missing a few key members who were expected to be part of the group based on previous MCU appearances, including Eli Bradley, who appeared in <em>The Falcon and the Winter Soldier</em> and is typically known as Patriot in the comics, and America Chavez, who had a major role in <em>Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness</em>. Just because they’re not in the concept art doesn’t mean they won’t show up in the final film, but fans seem to be divided on the Young Avengers line-up based on this image. I’m happy to see what looks like a reunion for Wiccan and Speed, though. Maybe Agatha’s ghost will show up at some point.</p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="e974546c3fc4ab4dbe9de08b81592f70" data-recommend-id="image://e974546c3fc4ab4dbe9de08b81592f70" data-format="jpg" data-width="2048" data-height="1138" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Hulk and She-Hulk talk to another Hulk in a village of Hulks." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Hulk and She-Hulk talk to another Hulk in a village of Hulks." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="false" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Marvel</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="e974546c3fc4ab4dbe9de08b81592f70" data-recommend-id="image://e974546c3fc4ab4dbe9de08b81592f70" data-format="jpg" data-width="2048" data-height="1138" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Hulk and She-Hulk talk to another Hulk in a village of Hulks." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Based on some pieces of concept art, fans are speculating <em>Avengers: Doomsday</em> may transport our modern-day superheroes to medieval times. One of these images includes what looks like a small village of Hulk people dressed in period attire, including Bruce Banner and Jen Walters.</p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="a19b75d8e4628b885dc40a9ca4a4aee4" data-recommend-id="image://a19b75d8e4628b885dc40a9ca4a4aee4" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="895" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Doctor Doom sits on a throne with Mr. Fantastic in chains on the ground." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Doctor Doom sits on a throne with Mr. Fantastic in chains on the ground." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="false" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Marvel</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="a19b75d8e4628b885dc40a9ca4a4aee4" data-recommend-id="image://a19b75d8e4628b885dc40a9ca4a4aee4" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="895" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Doctor Doom sits on a throne with Mr. Fantastic in chains on the ground." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>Adding onto the medieval time travel theory is an image of Doctor Doom himself sitting on a throne surrounded by mostly faceless subjects also in period clothing, but he also has what looks to be Reed “Mr. Fantastic” Richards on his knees, chained up and awaiting judgment. Doom is notably not the main villain in the upcoming <em>Fantastic Four: First Steps</em>, so it’s unclear if we’ll get much of a sense of the relationship between these two before <em>Avengers: Doomsday </em>premieres in 2026. It’s also unclear if this art is depicting the beginning of a new conflict between them or if it’s building off of something we’ll see unfold in <em>First Steps</em>. (Doom is confirmed to appear in the film in a post-credits scene.)</p><p>Another wrinkle in all of this is that it appears Doctor Strange and possibly Yelena are working for Doctor Strange in this odd reality. It looks like Doom’s presence may do a lot more than just yank us backwards in time.</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="191de005b15db655030ec4c62c6a45bc" data-recommend-id="image://191de005b15db655030ec4c62c6a45bc" data-format="jpg" data-width="2048" data-height="1062" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Black Panther stands in front of a panther-shaped mountain carving." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Black Panther stands in front of a panther-shaped mountain carving." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="false" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Marvel</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="191de005b15db655030ec4c62c6a45bc" data-recommend-id="image://191de005b15db655030ec4c62c6a45bc" data-format="jpg" data-width="2048" data-height="1062" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Black Panther stands in front of a panther-shaped mountain carving." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>Most of this concept art is easy to wrap your head around, but one piece is raising eyebrows because of its implications for the larger MCU. It depicts what, at a glance, looks like another version of T’Challa, the Black Panther who was originally played by the late Chadwick Boseman. <em>Black Panther: Wakanda Forever</em> acknowledged the actor’s death by having the hero die of an illness and passing the moniker to his sister, Shuri. It would be strange for Marvel to have made such a show of writing around Boseman’s death just to bring him back with a different actor four years later, but this art might not be of T’Challa at all. As <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/marvelstudios/comments/1j0zrx1/comment/mffmx89/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/marvelstudios/comments/1j0zrx1/comment/mffmx89/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">one fan points out</a></span>, the url associated with this piece specifically mentions T’Chanda, the grandfather of T’Challa and Shuri. That man is long gone by the time of <em>Avengers: Doomsday</em>, though, so it’s unclear how this might be implemented into the film, if at all. Some fans have noted that the concept art looks like it might be based on <em>Snowfall </em>actor Damson Idris, so he might be joining the MCU in some fashion in the near future.</p><hr><p>Because the MCU has been pivoting into this movie rather than leading up to it for years like it did with the last <em>Avengers</em> crossover, we still don’t know much about <em>Avengers: Doomsday</em> in the grand scheme of things. Doctor Doom is an enigma to us, so we can’t be sure of his motivations in the movies yet. But if this concept art is at all indicative of what the final movie will look like, it’s going to at least be an interesting spin on the MCU, one the franchise arguably needs right now. <em>Avengers: Doomsday </em>is set to premiere on May 1, 2026.</p></div></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
