            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Great fiction can’t fix bad people. That’s one takeaway from the fact that <a href="https://kotaku.com/elon-musk-grimes-cyberpunk-elden-ring-twitter-1850858252">Elon Musk seems to love</a> the classic sci-fi immersive sim <em>Deus Ex</em> despite it being a game precisely about how people like him are ruining the world. One of the game’s writers recently explained how that’s the worst part of its legacy.</p> <p>Released in 2000, <a href="https://kotaku.com/deus-ex-25-years-ion-storm-looking-glass-warren-ellis-1851784985"><em>Deus Ex</em> follows</a><a href="https://kotaku.com/deus-ex-25-years-ion-storm-looking-glass-warren-ellis-1851784985"> anti-terrorism operative JC Denton,</a> who uses his cybernetic enhancements to uncover the conspiratorial forces trying to take control of a world ravaged by social upheaval, economic collapse, and a plague. It’s both an investigation of how propaganda shapes society and what it means to be human, in addition to being a really clever stealth action game about hacking people’s private email.</p> <p>“That kind of political weight and social satire is a real common thread between <em>Deus Ex</em> and <em>Dishonored</em>,” Austin Grossman, who co-wrote the Warren Spector-directed hit with Sheldon Pacotti and Chris Todd, <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/fps/deus-exs-influence-on-elon-musk-may-be-its-longest-worst-legacy-says-its-writer/">recently told <em>PC Gamer</em></a>. “It is the thing that Elon Musk likes, creepily. It is creepily in Elon Musk’s worldview. So that may be its longest, worst legacy.”</p>

 <p>Musk has repeatedly called <em>Deus Ex</em> one of his <a href="https://x.com/elonmusk/status/1321245225755512832">favorite games ever</a>. When the pandemic began in early 2020, he even described it as feeling <a href="https://x.com/elonmusk/status/1241104391706304512?">like something from the game’s plot</a>. Musk also happens to be one of the world’s richest people, on track to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/09/05/business/elon-musk-tesla-pay-trillionaire.html">become the first trillionaire</a>, whose tech empire includes companies trying to implant devices <a href="https://www.npr.org/2024/01/30/1227850900/elon-musk-neuralink-implant-clinical-trial">directly into people’s brains</a>. Reading the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/deus-ex-at-20-the-oral-history-of-a-pivotal-pc-game">oral history of <em>Deus Ex</em>‘s creation</a>, there’s little doubt the <a href="https://kotaku.com/elon-musk-poe2-diablo-4-paid-boosting-fake-controversy-1851743670"><em>Diablo</em> cheater</a> would have been considered <a href="https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/are-we-the-baddies">one of the baddies</a> in its world.</p> <p>“It’s bizarre that Elon Musk would not recognize where he actually sits in the<em> Deus Ex</em> universe, because it is not in the JC Denton role,” Grossman said. “Musk plainly imagines he’s the JC Denton of this world—a plainspoken everyman, standing up to the elite. As is obvious to everyone, Musk is the one with power and he’s just pathologically incapable of honest introspection.”</p> <p>He continued, “I would say Musk is like a<em> Deus Ex</em> villain, except that the franchise doesn’t have any villains as whiny and self-servingly delusional as he’s shown himself to be.”</p>

              <p>How old is the TV in your living room? Is it absent of any smart features and streaming apps? Or maybe it is a smart TV, but you’re just not a fan of that particular manufacturer’s user interface (I’m looking at you LG with your wannabe Wiimote motion controls). You don’t need to be locked down to whatever your TV was capable of just out of the box. Pick up a Roku streaming stick for basically nothing and now you’ve got an intuitive, reliable way to stream content and navigate the apps. Usually, you can find<strong> the 2025 Roku Streaming Stick Plus with 4K and HDR support</strong> for $40. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3957/">However, right now Amazon is running a limited time deal that’s bringing its price down by 27% to just $29.</a></p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3957/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Jump Right In</h2>
<p>With a Roku streaming stick, you’ll have access to tons of different apps like Netflix, Hulu, and HBO Max (or whatever they’re deciding to call it this week). Customize the home screen to your preferences, putting the apps you use most frequently front and center. You’ll even be able to watch a good handful of Roku originals at absolutely no added cost. The service has shows like <em>Dinner Budget Showdown</em>,&nbsp;<em>Celebrity Family Food Battle</em>,&nbsp;<em>Martha Cooks</em>,&nbsp;<em>Emeril Cooks</em><em>,&nbsp;</em>and I’m sure a bunch of other stuff that aren’t cooking shows.</p>



<p>This streaming stick from Roku is capable of streaming content in 4K resolution and in HDR, so you won’t be sacrificing any image quality by making the jump from your 4K HDR TV’s interface to the more user-friendly Roku Plus. The streaming stick can even by synced up with your TV so it automatically turns on and off with one press. You can even control volume and navigate your Roku all with just the one remote. It even has a voice buttons which makes searching for your favorite TV shows or movies even easier. Just hold the button, say, “<em>My Cousin Vinny</em>,” and the next thing you know, you’ll be watching Marisa Tomei bang her foot on the ground as her biological clock ticks <em>like this</em>.</p>
<p>The Roku Streaming Stick Plus is designed to be unobtrusive. It’s compact form factor doesn’t block any other neighboring HDMI inputs. It’s powered by USB-A so you can just plug that end of it right back into your TV to run it. The whole thing will stay out of sight and you’ll avoid and extra cable running out, adding to the clutter.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3957/">Right now, you can grab the Roku Streaming Stick Plus for nearly 30% off for a limited time.</a></p>

              <p>Nintendo’s war against modders and ROM distributors has seen some brutal takedowns over the years, <a href="https://kotaku.com/bowser-agrees-to-pay-nintendo-10-million-in-hacking-la-1848172917">dishing out extraordinary punishments</a> against those who make it possible for people to pirate Nintendo games. The latest to fall afoul of the Japanese behemoth is Ryan Daly, who for the longest time looked like he was attempting an incredibly optimistic and clearly naive attempt to fight back. That’s over now as the MIG switch modder has settled for $2 million and an agreement to never touch a mod again in his life.</p> <p>Ryan “Homebrew Homie” Daly had run Modded Hardware, a site that sold modded Switches able to install homebrew or pirated versions of Switch games, and sold the tools with which others could do the same. Nintendo also claimed the site would return Switches with pirated games pre-installed. Back in March 2024, Nintendo threatened to sue Daly over the site, and the two parties agreed that Daly would stop his naughty behavior and the whole thing would go away. Daly said he would, then absolutely didn’t. So in June, Nintendo went to court.</p> <p>Daly continued to make surprising choices. Rather than rush to settle, the entrepreneur instead opted to respond to the complaint denying all wrongdoing, and even more wildly, did this without the advice of any lawyers. He even denied being responsible for the Modded Hardware business.</p>

 <figure id="attachment_2000623987" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000623987"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000623987">© Modded Hardware / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p><a href="https://torrentfreak.com/modded-hardware-defendant-denies-nintendos-copyright-claims-in-court-241006/">As reported by&nbsp;<em>TorrentFreak</em></a>, Daly’s <a href="https://torrentfreak.com/images/daly-response.pdf">response</a> wasn’t exactly stunning legal work. He essentially quoted the accusations and wrote “ANSWER: Denied” underneath them. However, despite all the denials of having done the things, Daly added “affirmative defenses” of the very things he was saying he didn’t do, defenses which included fair use and even accusing Nintendo of a “lack of unclean hands,” a legal doctrine that suggests Nintendo had acted unethically or dishonestly.</p> <p>Well, surprisingly enough this didn’t work out so well. This weekend the Seattle District Court <a href="https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.wawd.336725/gov.uscourts.wawd.336725.30.0.pdf">released the details of a settlement</a>, in which Daly agrees to pay Nintendo $2 million, as well as hand over the URL of his site, and even agrees to the seizure of all his technology that might contain the means to infringe the agreement. It also comes with the most astonishingly strict list of requirements based on what Daly is and isn’t allowed to do for the rest of his life, which goes on for pages and pretty much amounts to never touching another MIG switch or modding tool so long as he lives.</p> <p>Whether Daly can afford to pay the $2 million is largely irrelevant to Nintendo. The company <a href="https://kotaku.com/nintendo-gary-bowser-hacking-case-legal-jail-xecuter-1850346297">gleefully bankrupted Gary Bowser</a> over his association with a ROM-selling site in 2021, with a $10 million ruling the man will never be able to pay off, along with a gruesome 40-month prison sentence.</p>

              <p>It’s always frustrating when your phone dies in the middle of the day when you need it. From trying to order a ride to checking emails or just browsing something to pass the time, running low on battery can spoil it all. If you’d rather never have to go through that again, the solution is simple: grab a decent power bank.</p>
<p>But hold up — not all of these are worth your money. Some charge like they’re trying to break records, some suck their batteries dry too fast, and most are just too bulky to lug around. That’s where Anker enters the scene with a 10,000mAh model that’s our absolute favorite: And <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3966/">now that Amazon sells it for just $19, reduced from its original price of $26, there’s never been a better time to grab one and add it to your day kit</a>.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3966/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Our Fav Power Bank</h2>
<p><strong>Anker PowerCore 10K has a 10,000mAh capacity</strong> which is more than enough to charge <strong>most smartphones two or three times from one recharge</strong>. That’s to say you can go out all day without needing to worry about keeping your phone charged. It also works with tablets such as an iPad, so it’s not just on your phone. As <strong>airplane-friendly as well</strong>, you can even leave it in your carry-on bag without worrying about restrictions.</p>
<p>With Anker’s PowerIQ and VoltageBoost technology, <strong>it charges up to 5V/3A</strong>&nbsp;so you’re not waiting around for hours just to have your phone return to a decent battery level. That means charging for the briefest moment can provide you with a genuine boost, something that’s handy if you’re in transit with not much stopping time to refuel. And with<strong> both USB-C in and out and a traditional USB-A port</strong>, it supports both newer and older cables and gives you flexibility regardless of the daily device you’re working with.</p>



<p>With a size about the width of a smartphone, it easily fits into a pocket, small purse or backpack without adding bulk. You won’t wince lugging it around like with some of those other larger battery packs that are brick-like. It still packs enough juice in it to keep you powered up without sacrificing size, which is the reason so many swear by it for daily use and travel.</p>
<p><span>This deal feels like one of those no-brainers that should be grabbed before it disappears: You’re essentially getting travel-ready security for your phone or tablet at a price lower than most cases, and it’s backed by one of the most trusted names in charging.</span></p>

            <title><![CDATA[Sold at 73% Off, This HP Laptop With Office 365 and 384GB Storage Is Flying Off Amazon’s Shelves]]></title>
            <link>https://kotaku.com/sold-at-73-off-this-hp-laptop-with-office-365-and-384gb-storage-is-flying-off-amazons-shelves-2000623973</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/sold-at-73-off-this-hp-laptop-with-office-365-and-384gb-storage-is-flying-off-amazon%E2%80%99s-shelves.1291341/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>HP has dozens of laptops in its lineup right now, but there’s one model that still commands attention because it combines price, performance (Intel N150, 384GB storage, 32GB RAM, Microsoft 365), and daily use practicality. On Amazon, it has collected well <strong>over 1,500 reviews with an average rating of 4.5 out of 5</strong> when bought at full price, but now the story is quite different: <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3965/">at a whopping 73% discount, this HP “everyday” laptop costs just $399 compared to its normal price of $1,499</a>. And then on top of that discount, Amazon tosses in some extras straight into the box (wireless mouse, optical drive, 256GB SD card, and 1-Year Office 365) which makes this deal not worth passing up.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3965/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>What Does $399 Get You?</h2>
<p>For starters, you’re getting a reliable <strong>machine powered by Intel’s Quad-Core N150 processor</strong> which at clock speeds up to 3.4GHz provides smooth performance for day-to-day use. Which is to say, from streaming and surfing to document work and hopping on Zoom calls, everything is responsive. The integrated Intel UHD graphics chip serves up smooth video for casual gaming or just reading content online.</p>
<p>Then toss that in with <strong>32GB of RAM and it becomes even smoother</strong>:&nbsp;switching between apps isn’t hung up, and demanding tasks run without forcing you to close programs all the time. Storage capacity will not be a problem either: you’ve got 128GB of UFS onboard, and then there’s a provided 256GB SD card, which brings your <strong>storage to a whopping 384GB</strong>.</p>
<p>This is where things get very interesting: Microsoft 365 comes with the laptop (you <a href="https://gizmodo.com/download/microsoft-365">can download it here</a>). You receive <strong>a year’s subscription in full (worth $130)</strong>&nbsp;and it’s even the <strong>AI-powered version with Copilot thrown in</strong>. Think of having Word for writing papers or reports, Excel for calculating with pre-formatted formulas, PowerPoint for creating professional-grade presentations, Outlook to sort your email, and even Teams for working online. The Copilot AI feature in Office makes tasks like summarizing papers, writing messages, and scheduling calendars faster and more hands-off.</p>



<p>It doesn’t stop there, though. Aside from Office 365, the laptop package includes a <strong>wireless mouse and an optical drive</strong>, two easy but useful features that spare you the trouble of rushing to the store for accessories on purchasing day. A DVD drive in 2025 is not standard, but it’s useful if you’ve got old discs with photos, films, or software that you still want to use</p>
<p>On the software side, Windows 11 Pro powers all this and couples clean looks with helpful features like Snap Layouts to keep windows neatly organized on screen. For something portable and lightweight, the 14-inch version fits easily into a backpack and won’t weigh you down. Battery life is also good enough to get you through a day of use without having to be constantly recharged, another plus if you find yourself stuck away from a desk for hours.</p>
<p>Deals at this level don’t usually stick around long when word gets out, make sure you don’t miss it.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/this-2700-dell-laptop-is-practically-free-right-now-with-amazon-clearing-stock-until-it-sells-out-2000623966</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Dell is one of those omnipresent American brands that dominate the mass laptop market, and if you need to gear up for back-to-school or switch out your office configuration, Amazon just debuted a deal that’s hard to pass up.</p>
<p>Now, the Dell Inspiron <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3962/">15-inch touchscreen laptop (Intel 10 Core i5 1334U, 32GB DDR4 RAM, 1TB PCIe SSD) can be purchased for $699, down from its usual $2,699 price tag</a>. That’s a <strong>huge 74% discount</strong> and it brings a premium-level device into a price range that feels almost unbelievable. On top of that, you’ll get a <strong>free 8-in-1 USB-C hub</strong>.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3962/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Powerful Yet Affordable</h2>
<p>The heart of this device is its <strong>13th Gen Intel Core i5-1334U processor which has 10 cores and 12 threads</strong> to make multitasking responsive without slowing you down. Toss in generous 32GB of DDR4 RAM and you have the room to run all your day-to-day applications and resource-intensive tasks simultaneously without skipping a beat.</p>
<p>The 1TB PCIe NVMe SSD also offers plenty of space for files, movies, and downloads, and keeps start-up quick and applications snappy. No longer just sitting around waiting for stuff to load: everything just opens up immediately. For students with speedy access needed to class material or businesspeople working on large projects, that kind of performance is a huge difference in everyday use.</p>



<p>And of course, the screen is a major part of the experience and Dell hasn’t cut corners on it: This Inspiron laptop<strong> features a 15.6-inch Full HD touchscreen</strong> with an anti-glare finish and narrow borders so you enjoy sharp images and vibrant colors without distracting reflections. It’s the kind of screen that makes video calls clear and day-to-day browsing easier on the eyes. Combined with Intel Iris Xe graphics, you’ll also enjoy smoother graphics for light gaming or creative use like photo editing.</p>
<p>WiFi 6 is offered in this laptop, so you’ll get faster and more stable internet connections which is perfect if you spend a lot of time streaming, working from home, or on video calls. On top of Bluetooth and a solid port set, like Type-C, Type-A, HDMI, and even an SD card reader, you already have enough flexibility to attach your favorite peripherals or extend your setup with ease. And to top it all off, <strong>the bundle includes an 8-in-1 USB-C hub</strong>&nbsp;so more ports to connect external monitors, storage devices, or even wired broadband with RJ-45.</p>
<p>Windows 11 Pro in S Mode comes pre-installed with business-ready features available along with a personal and streamlined environment. That is, you can upgrade your workflow from day one without the additional time of configuring. And yet the device depends on performance and functionality without compromising on a sleek, modern design in black that slices well on a desk or on the move.</p>
<p>Deals like this don’t tend to linger long during high-demand periods like back-to-school, so if you’ve been considering an upgrade, this price drop makes the decision an easy one.</p>
