              <p>McDonald’s running&nbsp;<em>Pokémon</em> promotions with its Happy Meals is no new phenomenon. Most years, the two corporations team up to include packs of McDonald’s-marked <em>Pokémon TCG</em> cards in the kids’ meals, and it generally proves very popular. But recently, something else has changed: over the last year, <em>Pokémon</em> cards have become outlandishly popular, to the point <a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-tcg-prismatic-evolutions-surging-sparks-sold-1851738920">where they remain near-impossible to buy in stores thanks to scalpers and fanatics</a>. This mess is <a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-center-tcg-scalpers-journey-together-1851770342">just as bad in Japan</a> as it is in the U.S., and the ridiculous situation has spread to <a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-tcg-cards-pikachu-mcdonalds-japan-happy-meal-1851786307">a simple Happy Meal tie-in</a>, causing the three-day event to be abandoned early amidst chaotic scenes.</p> <p>As reported by&nbsp;<a href="https://nintendosoup.com/pokemon-tcg-mcdonalds-japan-campaign-draws-disgust-and-flak-for-food-waste-and-chaos/"><em>Nintendo Soup</em></a> (thanks&nbsp;<a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/mcdonalds-pokmon-card-giveaway-ends-early-amid-restaurant-chaos-scalping-and-widespread-food-waste-as-fans-buy-dozens-of-happy-meals-only-to-dump-uneaten-burgers"><em>IGN</em></a>), things have gotten so out of control that police were called to multiple McDonald’s locations, alongside massive numbers of Happy Meals being dumped in the streets uneaten once the cards had been removed. Things got so out-of-hand that <a href="https://www.mcdonalds.co.jp/company/info/2025/0809b/">McDonald’s Japan issued a statement</a> declaring the whole event over after just a single day.</p> <p>“We would like to inform you,” the statement begins, “that the distribution of Pokémon cards to customers who purchased Happy Meals® ‘Pokémon,’ which was scheduled for three days only from Saturday, August 9th to Monday, August 11th (national holiday), has ended at many stores due to higher-than-expected sales.” The company goes on to apologize to customers for “not being able to meet the expectations of our customers who were looking forward to the product due to the early end of distribution.” It then concludes, “Please refrain from contacting stores regarding stock availability.”</p>

 <p>This weekend’s circumstances seem likely to have been primarily caused by a unique Pikachu card contained in the packs, featuring the little mouse-thing sitting down to a fast food meal. McDonald’s sets usually feature re-used art from previous cards, making them not all that collectible, but <a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-van-gogh-museum-scalpers-pikachu-card-1850882131">a bespoke Pikachu generally causes everyone to collectively lose their minds</a>.</p> <p>It seems scalpers were a large part of the problem, with individual McDonald’s stores not helping by failing to stick to a five-meals-per-person rule. <a href="https://twitter.com/hapi_tori/status/1953942557660262413?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1953942557660262413%7Ctwgr%5E2d086785bef7b9afe7ef8b695a52e59037c66c47%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fnintendosoup.com%2Fpokemon-tcg-mcdonalds-japan-campaign-draws-disgust-and-flak-for-food-waste-and-chaos%2F">Photos of people buying dozens of Happy Meals at once</a> were posted to social media (with what looks like plenty of unpleasantly anti-Chinese sentiment to boot), <a href="https://twitter.com/Daiyamato69/status/1954102074129658324?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1954102074129658324%7Ctwgr%5E2d086785bef7b9afe7ef8b695a52e59037c66c47%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fnintendosoup.com%2Fpokemon-tcg-mcdonalds-japan-campaign-draws-disgust-and-flak-for-food-waste-and-chaos%2F">as well as pictures of many meals dumped in store doorways</a>, uneaten. The hideous waste of food seems to have driven the public backlash, even more than the lack of availability.</p> <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="ja" dir="ltr">拡散して‼️</p> <p>大阪のマクドナルドでハッピーセットのおまけのポケカが貰えないから返品させろと要求している外国人転売ヤー‼️💢</p> <p>中国人だかベトナム人だか知らないが、こんな事で警察の手を煩わせるんじゃねーよ💢</p> <p>悪質外国人は日本から出てけ‼️<br>日本の子供達がポケカ貰えなくて悲しんでるだろ💢 <a href="https://t.co/aqzvEPahYt">pic.twitter.com/aqzvEPahYt</a></p> <p>— ティトン (@bcfe70bord) <a href="https://twitter.com/bcfe70bord/status/1954131843088871429?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">August 9, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="ja" dir="ltr">渋谷だけでなく、色々な地域でマクドナルドのポイ捨てゴミは多いです。</p> <p>今回のハッピーセット騒動も含め、食品を買ったら責任持って食す。<br>ポイ捨てせずに自分で責任持って処理。</p> <p>これは常識中の常識です。 <a href="https://t.co/aX7B0cn19p">pic.twitter.com/aX7B0cn19p</a></p> <p>— スミレンジャーZ（愛称スミレちゃん、元スラウザーです） (@iijNWqUQ7i41630) <a href="https://twitter.com/iijNWqUQ7i41630/status/1954333122260353435?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">August 10, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <p>Of course, this embarrassing display really sucks for the kids who just wanted a cool Pokémon pack with their Happy Meal treat. I’ve been there, taking the boy for a rare McDonald’s meal because of a recent Squishmallows tie-in, only to find the restaurant had put in some tat from a previous Disney promotion after scalpers had scooped the lot. It sucks. People ruin everything.</p> <p>However, this is emblematic of a far larger issue regarding the <em>Pokémon TCG</em><em>&nbsp;</em>of late, where massive price hikes for even modern cards are motivating scalpers to snatch everything up, while The Pokémon Company International–<a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-tcg-cards-available-journey-together-stock-1851772771">despite repeated promises</a>–entirely fails to appropriately step up supply. Let’s hope this ridiculous bubble bursts soon.</p>

              <p><em>Battlefield 6</em>‘s open beta weekend drew in over a half a million people playing at the same time, smashing the all-time concurrent player record of <em>Call of Duty</em>. People, we have ourselves a good-old-fashioned FPS game-off.</p> <p>In these awful times, where ludicrous shareholder expectations and bigwig dividends drive publishers into wantonly firing hundreds of developers at a time, gaming rivalries feels like such an anachronism. There used to be a time when we could revel in two major franchises going head-to-head, massive companies trying to outdo the other, albeit with legions of overly-invested fans on either side spoiling it with their fervor. Now, that just sounds like a recipe for at least one well-respected development team getting wiped out.</p> <p>But, if there’s any franchises that can survive an old-fashioned two-game race, it’s&nbsp;<em>Call of Duty</em> and&nbsp;<em>Battlefield</em>. In fact, most of the previous big-noise battles involved <em>Call of Duty</em> at some point–the very first game in 2002 was created by a bunch of <em>Medal of Honor</em> devs who’d walked out on EA after a contract dispute, setting up its first rivalry. But for a very long time now, <em>CoD</em> has walked alone, dominating the holiday season every year no matter how mediocre it might be. Not this year though.</p> <p>This weekend, as recorded by&nbsp;<em>SteamDB</em>, the public beta for EA’s&nbsp;<em>Battlefield 6</em> peaked at <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/3081410/charts/">521,079</a> concurrent players. The best&nbsp;<em>Call of Duty</em> has ever managed is <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/1938090/charts/">491,670</a>. Now, those&nbsp;<em>CoD&nbsp;</em>numbers are hardly to be sniffed at, but it’s worth remembering this is based on the combination of both&nbsp;<em>Black Ops 6</em> and&nbsp;<em>Warzone</em> combined, and indeed after the extremely mainstream game has been available to buy in stores, as well as being the first&nbsp;<em>CoD</em> to be included day one as part of Xbox Game Pass. Then, if you want to argue for the other side, the&nbsp;<em>BF6</em> weekend was free and didn’t require pre-ordering the game, so might not be at all representative of how many people will show up to buy the game when it launches October 10.</p>

 <p>Still, EA must be dancing foot to foot. <a href="https://kotaku.com/battlefield-6-huge-player-count-steam-beta-jurassic-forza-castle-crashers-2000616307">The beta had over 300,000 trying to play it</a> before it even started, and then generated headlines with both <a href="https://kotaku.com/battlefield-6-bf6-open-beta-revive-medic-help-me-ea-fps-ps5-2000616628">how people were playing</a> and <a href="https://kotaku.com/battlefield-6-open-beta-cheating-cheaters-hacks-ea-dice-secureboot-pc-2000616686">how others were cheating</a>. Beating a Goliath like&nbsp;<em>Call of Duty</em>, no matter the specifics, must be giving everyone involved a lot of confidence in the new game, especially following <a href="https://kotaku.com/battlefield-2042-the-kotaku-review-1848123654">the extremely muted response</a> to 2021’s <em>Battlefied 2042</em>, even <a href="https://kotaku.com/battlefield-2042-bf2042-season-2-two-02-impressions-dlc-1849496591">after a year of fixes and updates</a>, with <a href="https://kotaku.com/battlefield-2042-refund-petition-ea-bf2042-change-1848524654">hundreds of thousands demanding their money back</a>.</p> <p>Of course, we have no idea how many people&nbsp;<em>total</em> played the beta. Concurrent player numbers are the only real measure we have, and while a very useful measure of popularity, don’t give us the whole picture. It could be that half a million people played total, all showing up at once, or that the 480,000 who played on Sunday were made up of many people who weren’t included in Saturday’s peak. Only EA could tell us, and unless they skew enormously favorably, likely won’t.</p> <p>Whether these numbers will be replicated on release remains to be seen. Activision is being extremely shy about&nbsp;<em>Black Ops 7</em>‘s release date, only pinning it down to before the end of 2025. My guess is that the publisher will avoid releasing too close to the initial buzz for <em>Battlefield 6</em>, perhaps opting for an early November date, hoping to pick up players who’ve burned out after a month of <i>Battlefield</i> and are looking for their next game. That’s not going to stop anyone (including us) comparing the two games in meticulous detail, of course.</p> <p>There’s a second, extended open beta weekend for&nbsp;<em>Battlefield 6</em>&nbsp;this week, starting Thursday 14 through Sunday 17.</p>
