              <p><span>While ex-BioWare producer Mark Darrah </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/anthem-single-player-offline-mode-bioware-ea-mark-darrah-2000659773"><span>made a whole pitch</span></a><span> about how EA could still salvage </span><i><span>Anthem </span></i><span>for relatively cheap, it does seem more likely that BioWare and its parent company are going to let the game </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/anthem-server-shutdown-final-hours-videos-clips-stream-2000659367"><span>die a meaningless death</span></a><span>. However, some fans are looking into how the game could remain playable despite the servers being shut down, and one person has already managed to get it running on a P2P server.</span></p> <p><span>YouTuber And799 has posted a video of the game running on local servers. Though some of the online features, such as looking at your online profile, didn’t work, And799 was able to get the game running with two players in the same matchmaking space. According to the video description, this is all just for “research” and an “experiment,” and shouldn’t be considered indicative of any kind of </span><i><span>Anthem </span></i><span>revival process. However, it is exciting to see that a playable version of the game is still possible, even if EA and BioWare aren’t helming it themselves.</span></p>

  <p><span>If that’s already possible mere days after </span><i><span>Anthem </span></i><span>was shut down on January 12, hopefully fan efforts to preserve the game bear fruit in the coming months. Even if you </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/anthem-server-shutdown-bioware-dragon-age-mass-effect-1851786136"><span>didn’t like </span><i><span>Anthem </span></i></a><span>or thought BioWare </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/anthem-bioware-mark-darrah-interview-rpg-shutdown-2000661337"><span>shouldn’t have made it</span></a><span>, a game shouldn’t disappear without a trace afterpeople paid money for it and hundreds of developers spent years working on it. Fans may get the game’s unfinished campaign back up and running, but it’s unclear how much of the online experience they’ll be able to rebuild.</span></p> <p><i><span>Anthem</span></i><span>’s shutdown comes about a year after </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/dragon-age-the-veilguard-bioware-layoffs-mass-effect-1851784416"><span>BioWare was subject to significant downsizing</span></a><span> following the launch of </span><i><span>Dragon Age: The Veilguard</span></i><span>, with remaining developers all working on the next </span><i><span>Mass Effect</span></i><span>. The studio put out a </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/mass-effect-5-n7-day-bioware-blog-teaser-url-krogan-2000642122"><span>small tease for the game on N7 Day last year</span></a><span>, but was completely silent when </span><i><span>Dragon Age</span></i><span>’s equivalent fan day </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/dragon-age-the-veilguard-day-bioware-layoffs-december-4-2000650888"><span>came and went in December</span></a><span>.</span></p>

            <title><![CDATA[What Games Are Forever Stuck In Your Backlog?]]></title>

              <p>Video game backlogs vary wildly from person to person. Some folks have massively long lists of games they want to play. Others might only have a few that they are dedicated to crossing off. But one thing I find true across all gaming backlogs is that there’s always one game that, for whatever reason, remains stuck on the list and seems unlikely to ever be finished.</p> <p>So we at <em>Kotaku, </em><a href="https://kotaku.com/reviews/backlog">in honor of our ongoing Backlog Week</a>, want to know what game or games are forever trapped in your backlog and why? Maybe its because you love it and <a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-legends-za-mega-dimension-how-long-to-beat-2000657800">can’t bear to watch credits roll</a>, or maybe it has an excruciating <a href="https://kotaku.com/13-bad-boss-fights-zelda-mass-effect-kingdom-hearts-1850334686">difficulty spike or story twist</a> that made you completely bounce off it.</p>

 <p>Speaking personally, I have two games that remain permanently stuck on my backlog like tiny splinters unable to be removed. The first is a more recent-ish title: <em>Cyberpunk 2077.</em></p> <p>I’ve now tried on three separate occasions to start playing <em><a href="https://kotaku.com/cyberpunk-2077-the-kotaku-review-1845946628">Cyberpunk 2077</a>.</em> And each time I get about two to three hours in and reach the moment when the game goes fully “open world,” I quickly fall off.&nbsp; There’s something about <em>Cyberpunk 2077</em>‘s city and world that just feels lifeless and dull. Walking around it doesn’t do much for me. Then I try to explore and find quests and I just get bored and stop. This annoys me a lot. There are people whose opinion I trust a lot who love<em> Cyberpunk 2077.</em> They adore it. They’ve played it more than once. And yet I can’t even get past the opening hours. Perhaps I’ll never cross this one off my list.</p>

 <p>The other game in my backlog is an old one: <em>Daggerfall</em>. I’m a big fan of the<em> Elder Scrolls</em> games, but I started with <em>Morrowind</em>. Each time I’ve tried to play <em>Daggerfall</em>, <a href="https://kotaku.com/elder-scrolls-daggerfall-unity-oblivion-remastered-1851779519">even the great Unity port,</a> I’m just unable to push through the ancient mechanics, menus, and design ideas. But again, I know people who love this game and find it super special. And as a big <em>Elder Scrolls</em> fan, I want to experience it. Sadly, that hasn’t happened yet, despite trying a few times in recent years.</p>

 <p>Anyway, leave your backlog games that won’t leave in the comments below, and tell us why they’re stuck forever on your list.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Ex-BioWare Dev Disputes The Idea That It Shouldn’t Have Made Anthem]]></title>
            <link>https://kotaku.com/anthem-bioware-mark-darrah-interview-rpg-shutdown-2000661337</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/anthem-server-shutdown-final-hours-videos-clips-stream-2000659367"><i><span>Anthem</span></i><span>’s servers have been shut down</span></a><span> for a week now, marking the end of a pretty tragic chapter in developer BioWare’s history. The live-service looter shooter’s crash and burn reportedly nudged publisher EA to let the studio strip out the reported multiplayer elements from the game that would go on to become </span><i><span>Dragon Age: The Veilguard</span></i><span>, which signaled to some that the studio was “returning” to its roots. However, as </span><i><span>Anthem</span></i><span> has been dropped down into an abyss, ex-BioWare producer Mark Darrah is disputing the notion that the game was </span><i><span>that</span></i><span> far out of left field for the studio.</span></p> <p><span>In an interview with </span><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Y65eoBVF0Y"><span>YouTuber Destin Legarie</span></a><span>, Darrah talked at length about the life and death of </span><i><span>Anthem</span></i><span>, and in the closing minutes, Legarie asks if there’s anything Darrah wants to “set the record straight” on regarding the game. Darrah replies that while many people want to point fingers solely at EA for mandating that the historically single-player RPG studio shift into making an ill-advised cooperative loot shooter, it wasn’t “all their fault.” He also said that, at the time, the prospect of making </span><i><span>Anthem </span></i><span>seemed like just the latest evolution for a studio that had evolved many times before, so he says he is less swayed by arguments stating that the company shouldn’t have even tried.</span></p>

  <p><span>“My feeling is that BioWare has always been changing,” he said. “I mean, by that argument, we should never have made </span><i><span>Neverwinter Nights</span></i><span> because we were a 2D RPG maker. We should never have made </span><i><span>Mass Effect</span></i><span> because we were a tactical RPG maker, not an action RPG maker. So I don’t know that that argument holds a lot of weight for me. To me, it’s like, yeah, your studios evolve, and they try new things, and was </span><i><span>Anthem</span></i><span> too big of a reach? Yeah, for sure. But could you tell at the time? I don’t know. I don’t know that you could.”</span></p> <p><span>In a perfect world, developers would be able to make mistakes like </span><i><span>Anthem </span></i><span>without risking going under, but reports about </span><i><span>Anthem</span></i><span>’s development indicate that it did some seismic damage to BioWare </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/dragon-age-the-veilguard-bioware-layoffs-mass-effect-1851784416"><span>internally that it’s still recovering from</span></a><span>. The company was </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/mass-effect-5-bioware-dragon-age-veilguard-dlc-layoffs-1851750767"><span>downsized last year</span></a><span> as a small team works on the next </span><i><span>Mass Effect </span></i><span>game. We’ll see if it’s enough to get the studio back on track after a decade of strife.</span></p>
