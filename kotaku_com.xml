Usually revealed to be happening with just a few days notice, this peculiar two-month run-up suggested that big things could be in store. Oh my goodness, was that ever not the case.</p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="196165" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="What’s Coming Out Beyond Pokémon: The Indigo Disk | The Week In Games" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="95" data-playlist="196165,195519,195618" data-current="196165"><div><p>What’s Coming Out Beyond Pokémon: The Indigo Disk | The Week In Games</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196165/196165_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196165/196165_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196165/196165_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196165/196165_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/21711.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>As the 24-minute pre-recorded stream went out today, I watched in growing disbelief. Forget “could have been an email,” this Presents could have been a text message. “We’re adding a few new Pokémon to old games, and there’s a generic-looking puzzle game for kids.” That was the sum total of new information delivered, unless the information you’d been craving about this October’s <em>Pokémon Legends: Z-A</em> were the first names of about three characters.</p><p>Things didn’t start out well, with a bizarrely amateurish video promoting this year’s Pokémon World Championships, accompanied by what looked like camcorder footage of 2024's finals and a guy mumbling about how he hoped we’d come along. Traditionally, Nintendo and Pokémon like to open these videos with <em>something</em>, a fun tease or a cute reveal. But given the entire thing didn’t have a single piece of <em>something</em> to offer, it couldn’t appear there either.</p><p>There was a brief moment of happiness where we got to see a bunch of clips from the adorable stop-motion Netflix show&nbsp;<em>Pokémon Concierge</em>, which has new episodes coming on September 4, before jumping over to UK stop-motion studio Aardman (they behind <em>Wallace &amp; Gromit</em>) who have a new show with the astonishing name&nbsp;<em>The Misadventures of Sirfetch’d &amp; Pichu</em>. A brief clip was shown that absolutely did not deliver.</p><figure id="" data-id="819dd88d89d7d37a5875f13894e7d736" data-recommend-id="image://819dd88d89d7d37a5875f13894e7d736" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1074" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Some crappy plastic figures on a tabletop." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Some crappy plastic figures on a tabletop." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->The Pokémon Company / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="819dd88d89d7d37a5875f13894e7d736" data-recommend-id="image://819dd88d89d7d37a5875f13894e7d736" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1074" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Some crappy plastic figures on a tabletop." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>But this was all as nothing compared to the cheek-chewingly awkward section on PokéPark Kanto, an as-yet unbuilt new section of some Japanese theme park that’s going to be Pokémon-themed. This included the excruciating moment in which Junichi Masuda,&nbsp;chief creative fellow of The Pokémon Company, told us how this would be a place “where Pokémon truly exist” accompanied by—I kid you not—shots of tiny plastic Pokémon on crappy little models, and then, somehow worse, plastic figures just plonked down in some random woodland. Oh my god. Also, I cannot get over how Masuda was shown looking ever-further away from the camera every time he appeared.</p><figure id="" data-id="8d0727825b0d833ec0b60449ff5f9a71" data-recommend-id="image://8d0727825b0d833ec0b60449ff5f9a71" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A man looks ever-further away from a camera." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A man looks ever-further away from a camera." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->The Pokémon Company / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="8d0727825b0d833ec0b60449ff5f9a71" data-recommend-id="image://8d0727825b0d833ec0b60449ff5f9a71" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A man looks ever-further away from a camera." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>It was then time to move on to a montage of old games receiving new Pokémon, which would usually appear after a couple of nice surprises, rather than someone putting some plastic figures on a table top and saying it’s a theme park. But then it was time for THE BIG NEW POKEMON GAME REVEAL!</p><p><em> Pokémon Friends</em> is...a generic-looking puzzle game, the sort that’s usually dressed up as “improve your brain” nonsense, just a bunch of sliding tiles and sokoban games. And I swear to you, this genuinely was the only new reveal for the entire Presents.</p><p>Rather than in any way acknowledging that there’s no new mainline <em>Pokémon</em> game this year, instead we were told about yet more nothingness for the three-year-old <em>Scarlet</em> and <em>Violet</em> games, a chance to get shiny versions of a couple of monsters in raids, and voiceover informing us that it runs better on Switch 2. We also got another quick glimpse at the turn-based strategy game<em> Pokémon Champions</em>, announced back in February, but not due until some point in 2026. And then it was the big event: a bunch of things we already knew about <em>Pokémon Legends: Z-A. </em>Beyond the names of a couple of characters, the only actually new piece of information was that there was to be a Mega Dragonite. And <em>oh dear god</em> it’s some unholy monstrosity that should have been put down at birth.</p><figure id="" data-id="fa4ea827a66c2d64deb4c98f1c2f5a65" data-recommend-id="image://fa4ea827a66c2d64deb4c98f1c2f5a65" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="751" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Mega Dragonite" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Mega Dragonite" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->The Pokémon Company / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="fa4ea827a66c2d64deb4c98f1c2f5a65" data-recommend-id="image://fa4ea827a66c2d64deb4c98f1c2f5a65" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="751" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Mega Dragonite" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>And then it was done. A two-month pre-announced event that felt like it had been thrown together by a kid who realized their project deadline was tomorrow. Just the most “Uh, shit, what have we got in the office we can use?” energy.</p><p>Surely there’s <em>something</em> they’ve held back about <em>Z-A</em> that we don’t know yet, some twist or innovative concept they could have mentioned? And who gave clearance on dedicating a full two minutes to a theme park that’s presumably currently a building site, doesn’t open until next year, and isn’t relevant to 95 percent of people watching? There wasn’t even a 3D CAD model of the thing to look at! I wish I could have been there to watch the team of people who had to lug some fiberglass Pokémon out to the nearest woods and film them, presumably all just looking at one another in bemusement over why they’d been asked to do this deeply mad thing.</p><p>I want to be generous and think that back in May, The Pokémon Company had convinced itself that it would be ready by now to make some early reveal of Gen X and next year’s new mainline <em>Pokémon</em> game. Maybe the folks there thought they’d have a 10th-generation monster they could show us, or even just some elusive trailer revealing the new region. Sure, it’d be early, given the game likely won’t be out before October 2026, but it’d make some sense of why they’d bothered to organize the Presents in the first place.</p><p>Because what we got instead was the video streaming equivalent of a sweating executive saying, “Er, the reason I brought you all here today is...” and then pointing out the window and faking a heart attack.</p><p>It does make me worry about Pokémon overall. Missing the big game this year might have made sense, given how clearly overworked Game Freak were three years ago when <em>Legends</em> was a spring release, and <em>Scarlet </em>and <em>Violet </em>came out in the fall. But you’d imagine they’d want to let us know big things were coming? And where were the awesome new oddities? <em>Pokémon Friends</em> ain’t it. Instead, it all felt like just sticking a couple of new monsters in a handful of old games, and hoping they’d get away with describing old information about <em>Z-A</em> as “news.”</p><p>.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://kotaku.com/pokemon-presents-legends-z-a-unite-champions-netflix-1851786687]]></content:encoded>

On mobile devices, the game is free-to-play with microtransactions. Which isn’t great, but it’s hardly unexpected from a mobile game meant to make you check in with daily puzzles and challenges (and maybe spend a buck or two). Where things get weird, however, is that the Switch version is a $10 purchase, but still has all the microtransaction elements intact.</p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="195519" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="I Didn’t Play Final Fantasy XVI ‘Right,’ And That’s OK" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="148" data-playlist="195519,195905,196646" data-current="195519"><div><p>I Didn’t Play Final Fantasy XVI ‘Right,’ And That’s OK</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195519/195519_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195519/195519_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195519/195519_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195519/195519_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/21013.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>The <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.nintendo.com/us/store/products/pokemon-friends-switch/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/store/products/pokemon-friends-switch/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">“Basic Pack”</a></span> on Nintendo’s console includes “30 puzzles, 70 craftable plush, and all 11 yarn types.” On top of this, there are two “Puzzle On!” packs that cost $15 each, or you can buy them together for $26.

The intended trade-off here seems to be that you can play <em>Pokémon Friends</em> on your Switch without ever being hit with a puzzle limit, but you lose the chance to try the game out to see if you even like the thing, as you can do on your phone. We’ve reached out to The Pokémon Company for comment and will update the story if we hear back.</p><p><em>Pokémon Friends </em>was one of the only real reveals during today’s Pokémon Presents showcase, but there was plenty of other news about the company’s already-known mobile games, a new look at the next season of <em>Pokémon Concierge</em>, and a breakdown of the story and characters of <em>Pokémon Legends: Z-A</em>.</p></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://kotaku.com/pokemon-friends-switch-price-free-microtransactions-1851786692]]></content:encoded>
