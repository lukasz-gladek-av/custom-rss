It was a brutal scene and a controversial choice in <em>The Last of Us Part II</em>, but a lot of people who watch the show never touched the games and aren’t tuned into online video game discussions enough to have caught wind of this moment. So even though Abby essentially voiced her intentions directly to the audience in episode one, newcomers may have had some hope that this would be a season-long conflict that Joel might survive, rather than one that would see him taken out just two episodes into the season.</p><p>Newcomers are in shambles and posting their reactions online. After sitting with this grief for five years, I eat this shit up. I love re-experiencing the crash-out vicariously through others. By the time <em>The Last of Us Part II</em> was over, I was at peace with it and understood why the story had put us through this. The TV show is extending the game’s story <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/last-of-us-hbo-max-show-part-2-season-3-4-ellie-abby-1851521708&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/last-of-us-hbo-max-show-part-2-season-3-4-ellie-abby-1851521708">across multiple seasons</a></span>, so it might take some time before viewers get that same closure, but for now, they get to sit with all this grief, and I’m lapping up their reactions.</p><p>If you or a loved one has been personally victimized by <em>The Last of Us </em>season two, there are steps you can take to mitigate any further harm. Please remove all golf paraphernalia from your home, keep your old acoustic guitars in their cases and out of sight, and hide all instances of Pearl Jam from your Spotify playlists.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Hordes are a pillar in<em> Days Gone</em> gameplay and with our new Horde Assault mode arriving in the remaster, we wanted to make this unique combat experience more accessible to our players.” </p><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BJ5L-TIK1E&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BJ5L-TIK1E" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Horde Assault</a></span> adds 300 more Freakers to the onscreen attacks and introduces a permadeath mode to up the stakes of survival, but it’s not the only new feature dropping in the <em>Days Gone</em> remaster out on PS5 and PC on April 25. Subtitle and background customization adds 11 new colors to help with dialogue visibility, and a fully customizable high-contrast mode will also help distinguish the HUD and UI from the rest of the game.</p><p> There’s also UI narration and my personal favorite tweak: audio cues for helping players locate the game’s 240 collectibles. The option to auto-complete quick-time events has been made available in all difficulty modes as well, not just while playing on easy. It’s a nice suite of accessibility upgrades and follows a trend of Sony using next-gen ports and remasters to modernize gameplay customization features and introduce quality-of-life improvements across some of its older games. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/days-gone-remastered-coming-to-ps5-in-april-1851762060?_gl=1*frsg3j*_ga*MTg4NjY0MzM1NS4xNzM5NDU1MDcz*_ga_V4QNJTT5L0*MTc0NTMyODQxMC4xMjAuMS4xNzQ1MzMxNjM4LjQ0LjAuMA..&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/days-gone-remastered-coming-to-ps5-in-april-1851762060?_gl=1*frsg3j*_ga*MTg4NjY0MzM1NS4xNzM5NDU1MDcz*_ga_V4QNJTT5L0*MTc0NTMyODQxMC4xMjAuMS4xNzQ1MzMxNjM4LjQ0LjAuMA..">The new version of<em> Days Gone</em></a></span> is $50, but anyone who has the game already can upgrade for $10. </p><p>.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
