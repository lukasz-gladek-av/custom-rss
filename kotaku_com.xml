I find the sport boring to watch. I’ve never liked any soccer video games. I outright hated EA’s <em>FIFA </em>series any time I was forced to play it for a few minutes. I didn’t even love<em> Rocket League.</em> And yet, I stayed up until 2 a.m. over the weekend playing a soccer game. And I did it again the next night. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/rematch-does-it-have-crossplay-launch-no-xbox-ps5-pc-1851784595&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/rematch-does-it-have-crossplay-launch-no-xbox-ps5-pc-1851784595">That’s because <em>Rematch</em>, out now,</a></span> is unlike any other soccer game I’ve played or seen. It captures the best parts of the sport while excising the junk. The result is amazing. </p><p>Most modern soccer games are played from a high-up perspective, and you’re asked to control the entire team all at once. In these games, you aren’t really <em>playing </em>soccer, but instead controlling a match from afar like a weird soccer god. For fans of the sport, like my brother, this can be fun enough. But <em>Rematch</em>, out now on Xbox, PS5, and PC, is very, very different. In <em>Rematch</em>, you control one player throughout the whole match. The camera is located directly behind you, and every other player on the pitch (I Googled that) is controlled by another player.</p><p>Those changes alone are enough to make <em>Rematch</em> stand out from <em>FIFA</em> and similar soccer games. (No, I won’t call it football.) But that alone is not why I keep playing the colorful and stylized <em>Rematch</em>. No, what has me hooked is how it plays. </p><p>Moving, sliding, shooting, blocking, and passing in <em>Rematch</em> feel wonderful. Everything is snappy and responsive. When my brother charges up the middle and I’m being attacked by two players, I can effortlessly hit one button to slip the ball behind me, maneuver past the defenders, and pass it to my bro without even looking. Other times, a long pass will be hurled to me and I can run up to it and bicycle kick it into the goal, adding a bit of bend to the shot before it goes in. </p><p>All of this feels great, and once you’ve learned the controls, it’s a blast. Thankfully, the opening tutorial gives you just enough of the basics that you’ll be set to hold your own online. As you play more, you’ll learn more ways to combine the controls and techniques you were taught into more complicated and impressive moves. For example, you can flick the ball over your head and kick it in midair, aiming not to score but to bounce it off the wall above the goal, hopefully throwing off the goalie in the process and setting up a teammate to finish the shot.</p><p>Oh, right, the wall around the field. I forgot to mention that. See, the soccer in <em>Rematch </em>isn’t normal soccer. There are no yellow or red cards. No penalties. Instead, the game of soccer has been distilled down into its simplest form. Two goals, a pitch, a few players, and the ability for goalies to touch the ball with their hands. That’s it. And around you is a giant clear wall that stops balls from flying out of bounds. (This wall also changes during the match via fancy AR-tech to display wild settings, like being in space or in a jungle.) You can use this wall to bounce passes off at weird angles, too. </p><figure id="" data-id="0a42ab144b49c3c6b3a1b8a02cde6e19" data-recommend-id="image://0a42ab144b49c3c6b3a1b8a02cde6e19" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Sloclap</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="0a42ab144b49c3c6b3a1b8a02cde6e19" data-recommend-id="image://0a42ab144b49c3c6b3a1b8a02cde6e19" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>When playing <em>Rematch</em>, I almost felt like a kid playing basketball on a small court in the park with my friends. We didn’t follow most of the rules. No, instead we just played a pure form of basketball that was focused on being fun and exicting, letting us do wild shit and make really dumb mistakes. <em>Rematch</em> recaptures that feeling of playing a sport in its purest, simplest form. And it’s exhilarating.</p><p><em>Rematch </em>is also filled with smart, tiny design choices that keep matches flowing. If a team goes up four goals, the game ends due to a mercy rule. No dragged-out matches against much better teams. There are four options to communicate, and if you spam any of them, like saying “Thanks” or “Sorry” too much, you’ll be blocked from using them for a bit. Anyone can be the goalie, just drop back to the goal and if you’re alone, you become the goalie, giving you increased stamina and the ability to catch and hold the ball. Don’t want to be the goalie, walk away. Simple as that.</p><p>There are no stats to manage, perks to unlock, cards to earn, or anything like that. There’s a basic battle pass system, but it’s just cosmetics like new shirts and socks. The rest of the game is lean and focused. If <em>Rematch’s </em>developers set out to make a soccer game that is badass, super fast, and very fun, that is also easy to pick up play, while having a ton of depth for those who are willing to sink dozens of hours into it, well, job well done. <em>Rematch</em> is the best soccer game I’ve ever played. And it’s one of the best games of 2025 so far. </p><p> .<br></p></div></div><br/><br/>https://kotaku.com/rematch-game-ps5-xbox-game-pass-review-soccer-crossplay-1851784959]]></content:encoded>

But it is still annoying, and talking to others who are experiencing this heat, it’s clear I’m not alone.<br></p><p>I live in Kansas, where we have luckily been able to avoid some of the higher temperatures seen in places like Seattle, NYC, and the UK.

More graphically impressive games on my PC cause extra heat to build up in my tiny home office. Consoles also spit out a shocking amount of hot air when you play games that push the hardware. The Xbox Series X, in particular, is very effective at expelling burning hot air at a rapid rate. This is very good for the console, of course. But it also means that I have a mini-jet engine cooking me alive. At least it’s quiet while I melt.<br></p><p>I spoke to some friends who are experiencing similar issues. Some of them are avoiding certain games on specific platforms right now because it’s too damn hot, and because running your AC all day is expensive and bad for the environment. I personally try to limit how often I run our apartment’s AC system, and if I can save some money and electricity by skipping some sessions of <em>Marvel Rivals,</em> that seems like a good trade-off.</p><p>And sure, as those folks on that once-popular show often said, “Winter is coming.” Well, first fall, <em>then </em>winter. The point is: Cooler and colder days are not too far away. But as these extreme shifts in weather and climate become more common and more extreme every year, I expect the summer months to become an even worse time to use electronics that produce tons of heat. </p><p>Of course, as things get worse, being able to play games comfortably will probably become one of my lower priorities behind things like finding water, staying cool, and fighting off roving bandits hunting down any resources they can find. Still, I’ll miss playing video games. </p><p> .<br></p></div></div><br/><br/>https://kotaku.com/it-s-too-hot-to-play-video-games-1847410462]]></content:encoded>

According to some experts, the mini-outrage was spurred on by a poor AI translation of what  Sakurai actually said, and shows the pitfalls of a  media ecosystem that increasingly relies on machine translation to understand a global medium. </p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="196055" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="6 Things To Know Before Starting Persona 5 Tactica" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="227" data-playlist="196055,196626,195697" data-current="196055"><div><p>6 Things To Know Before Starting Persona 5 Tactica</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196055/196055_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196055/196055_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196055/196055_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196055/196055_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/21584.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>“<em>Super Smash Bros.</em> Director Masahiro Sakurai says large scale game development is becoming too time consuming and unsustainable,” read a now-deleted summary of an interview Sakurai gave to <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.itmedia.co.jp/business/articles/2504/18/news061.html&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.itmedia.co.jp/business/articles/2504/18/news061.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>ITmedia Business Online</em></a></span>, a summary that rapidly spread on websites and subreddits over the weekend. “He believes Generative AI is an option to improve work efficiency.”</p><p>The summary relied on machine translation of what Sakurai had said, an increasingly common practice on social media where information sources for companies, many of which reside in Japan, are frequently in other languages (indeed X, formerly known as Twitter, has a translation tool directly built in, while places like Bluesky link out to Google’s tools). Amid growing criticisms that generative AI initiatives are just over-hyped plagiarism machines, many instantly lamented Sakurai’s apparent take. Et tu,<em> Smash</em> daddy?

On the other hand, the market for indie games made by solo and small groups is also growing. How do you see the future of the gaming market? </p><p><strong> Sakurai:</strong> To be honest, nobody knows what the future holds [TN: he used the proverb ‘The inch ahead is darkness’ which should mean that]. I think when we want to make a large-scale game like it is in the present day, it’d take so much labor that we’d go into a situation where it’s not sustainable. I feel like we cannot keep going on like this, but at this point, the one effective solution that comes to my mind would be something like Generative AI. I feel like we’ve come to a phase where we must change the schemes, for example by utilizing Generative AI to improve work efficiency. And we might enter an era where only companies that could deal well with those changes would survive.</p></blockquote><p>Rather than Sakurai talking about what needs to be done or what he plans to do right now, the snippet about AI is situated in a series of hypotheticals about the future. While it’s notable that he’s not asked about AI directly, and instead brings it up himself voluntarily, it’s also one small throwaway thought in a longer interview that touches on a bunch of other topics. Plus we don’t even know specifically which tools Sakurai is think of here. Procedural generation and other techniques already prevalent in large games like <em>Xenoblade Chronicles 3</em>? Or actually using generative AI to make <em>Smash Bros.</em> character art and rig up animations for different costumes? </p><p>A good interviewer might follow up on these points but the subtle context clues that indicate the difference between wary warning and enthusiastic endorsement aren’t likely to come through in rough and dirty machine translations. “It’s the sort of nuance that a machine translator would have trouble picking up on because it means filling in blanks that it will never realize are there,” James told <em>Kotaku</em>. “So much of Japanese as a language, as you might be aware, operates by implication and shared assumptions between two people and with this wording in particular that Sakurai uses, no machine translation is going to reasonably pick up on what I’m talking about because the very context and tenor of the conversation itself informs how certain words and grammar are parsed in the Japanese.”<br></p><p>Fighting to preserve that nuance might be a losing game, especially online where so many conversations get flattened into familiar tropes and binaries to begin with.

Not to mention that there are still perfectly defensible reasons for being critical of Sakurai appearing to legitimize generative AI at all. </p><p>James argues that’s a difference between the American and Japanese contexts around AI and game development that goes deeper than translation mistakes. “AI discourse in Japan online is generally pretty far behind the west and criticism, while growing, mostly comes from outspoken individuals,” he wrote. “There is a lot of forced hype surrounding AI when it comes to advertising like in the west and certainly there are boneheads who actively shill for it, including in games. But overall at a social level, I would say it has yet to be subjected to the same level of rigor outside savvy creatives as abroad.”</p><p>The debate over what Sakurai actually said and meant is also a symptom of a growing problem in Western games media as sites lose sources and industry churn pushes out veteran staff (<em>Kotaku</em> once had three fluent Japanese speakers on staff at the same time). “Overall I do think it’s really concerning to see people recently trusting machine translators more than actual humans who have learned the languages,” Stenbuck told <em>Kotaku</em>. “Like, I do admit that the accuracy of machine translators has increased so much compared to the previous years, but there are still some phrases that are liable to be misinterpreted unless the translators know the exact context surrounding the statements.”</p><p>.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://kotaku.com/ai-translation-of-smash-bros-directors-comments-about-1851784945]]></content:encoded>
