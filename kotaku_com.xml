              <p>If you’re not a fan of bulky and noisy PCs taking over your entire workstation, switching to a mini PC makes sense. These offer reliable performance for everyday tasks in a much smaller (and quieter) form factor. Today is a great time to pick one up, all thanks to Amazon.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6916/">The retailer is offering the Kamrui Hyper H2 mini PC for $460 right now, after knocking a whopping 40% off its usual $769 price</a>. And as if that wasn’t enough, you’ll also enjoy an extra 5% discount at checkout with free delivery, which brings the overall price down even further. But as you’d expect, it’s a limited-time offer that expires soon. If you’ve been eyeing a portable, yet powerful mini PC, this is your chance to upgrade for less.</p>

<h2>Impressive Performance</h2>
<p>The PC is compact, so can easily fit into tighter spaces and cluttered desktops. You can even mount it under the desk or behind the monitor for a cleaner setup. Performance, however, is seriously impressive. The thing runs on a 14450HX processor with 10 cores (6P + 4E), and turbo speeds up to 4.8GHz. Expect roughly 60% higher multi-core performance than the i5-12450H and up to 180% higher than the i7-1185G. Translation? Smooth performance for everyday tasks such as browsing, streaming, and light office work, along with headroom for demanding projects that require more resources.</p>
<p>There’s a modest 16GB of DDR4 memory to keep things running smoothly as you use the PC for a variety of needs. It’s not massive, but it still lets you multitask through busy days without experiencing slowdowns. Storage, on the other hand, is taken care of by a high-speed 512GB M.2 NVMe PCIe Gen4×4 SSD, which offers enough space to house larger files, media libraries, games, and more. What’s even better is that both the memory and the storage capacity are expandable, with support for up to 64GB of DDR4 RAM and as much as 4TB of NVMe SSD storage, if your needs grow in the future. Basically, you won’t have to rely on external solutions with this at hand.</p>



<p>The system is capable of supporting a triple-display setup with HDMI 2.0, DP 1.4b, and a full-featured USB-C port that also supports DisplayPort Alt Mode, 10Gbps data transfer, and 15W power delivery. With this, you can use your primary screen to get work done, while the others for team meetings and displaying reference material. Other connectivity options include Wi-Fi 6 (802.11ax), Bluetooth 5.2, Gigabit Ethernet, two USB 3.2 Gen2 ports (10Gbps), and USB 3.2 Gen1 ports (5Gbps). This selection makes it incredibly easy to connect all your essential peripherals like printers, keyboards, mice, and more, without feeling limited.</p>
<p>Kamrui has also packed the PC with a dual-fan cooling system, which is paired with full copper heat sinks and dedicated aluminum heatsinks to ensure consistent performance, even under heavy loads. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6916/">There’s a lot more to appreciate about this mini PC, especially now that it’s down to just $460.</a> This 40% discount makes the purchase a lot more affordable, but it won’t be around forever. It’s best to grab the offer soon, as it could wrap up any moment now.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Anker Steam Deck Docking Station Was Already a Value Pick, Now It’s at Its Lowest Price Ever After Another Discount]]></title>

              <p>When Valve released the Steam Deck, it reset expectations for what portable PC gaming could look like. I mean, they did just copy Nintendo’s homework with the Switch design, but that misses the bigger point. The Steam Deck didn’t ask players to rebuild their libraries or buy special versions of games. Gamers can take their existing Steam collections on the road. That single decision helped create an entirely new class of hardware: handheld gaming PCs. Sure, we’ve always had gaming laptops, but the appeal of being able to easily pick-up and play on a dedicated piece of gaming hardware is undeniable.</p>
<p>As impressive as the Steam Deck is in handheld form, its screen can feel limiting in certain situations. A 7.4-inch display works great on a commute or during travel, but it doesn’t always suit relaxed couch gaming. Sometimes you want to stretch out and play on a large television, the same way consoles have done for years. Thanks to docking solutions, the Steam Deck can handle that role with ease. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6915/">One suitable option comes from Anker, and it’s currently discounted by 10%.</a> The dock usually sells for $33, but a $3 price cut brings it down to a clean $30 for a short time. Sure, it’s not the greatest discount ever, but $30 for a Steam Deck docking station is an absolutely fair value.</p>

<h2>See Every Detail</h2>
<p>Once connected, the Steam Deck can output to an external display at up to 4K resolution and 60Hz over its HDMI port, a major step up from its native 1280 × 800 handheld resolution. That extra clarity makes a noticeable difference on large TVs and monitors. The dock also works with other devices, including other handheld PCs like the ASUS ROG Ally, Lenovo Legion Go, and even tablets such as the iPad.</p>
<p>The dock supports up to 100W USB-C Power Delivery, keeping the Steam Deck charged while it’s connected to a display. Then when you’re ready to take it on the road, it’ll be at full charge.</p>



<p>It comes with a few built-in USB-A and USB-C ports which allow for wired controllers, keyboards, or other accessories. An integrated Ethernet port supports speeds up to 1,000Mbps, offering a more stable connection for online games and faster downloads compared to Wi-Fi.</p>
<p>The compact design makes the dock easy to pack, great for traveling. You can play handheld on the way to your destination, then dock it to a hotel or Airbnb TV later. The open-face design also allows tabletop use, letting the screen sit at a comfortable angle while you play with a controller, no TV required.</p>
