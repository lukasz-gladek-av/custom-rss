And WWE World Champion Gunther attempted to regain his confidence when he faced off against former champion Damien Priest.</p><p>Survivor Series has always been a fan favorite, and these 10 WWE superstars were the best parts of a stellar Premium Live Event (PLE).</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="2447097e8481341c9ec5a1402d9b7e0a" data-recommend-id="image://2447097e8481341c9ec5a1402d9b7e0a" data-format="jpg" data-width="6192" data-height="4128" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Shinsuke Nakamura" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Shinsuke Nakamura" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="getty" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->WWE<!-- --> (<!-- -->Getty Images<!-- -->)</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="2447097e8481341c9ec5a1402d9b7e0a" data-recommend-id="image://2447097e8481341c9ec5a1402d9b7e0a" data-format="jpg" data-width="6192" data-height="4128" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Shinsuke Nakamura" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p><strong>Last Month’s Ranking: </strong>N/A</p><p><strong>Last Month’s Segments: </strong>Making his return to WWE television a few weeks ago, the former Royal Rumble winner targeted WWE United States Champion LA Knight after the popular superstar defeated fellow WWE SmackDown wrestler Berto. Following the attack, Nakamura reverted to his villainous strategy, having promo videos (spoken in his native Japanese tongue) played on the big screen during Knight’s matches in an attempt to distract him. A Survivor Series match was set for LA Knight’s U.S. title. Overall, it was a decent way to reintroduce the former IWGP Heavyweight Champion into storylines.</p><p><strong>Survivor Series In-Ring Performance:</strong> Nakamura hardly missed in his match with LA Knight, while Knight seemed a bit off, not getting in as much offense as we’ve become accustomed to seeing from the rising star. The story of this somewhat one-sided match was to reestablish Nakamura as a credible opponent and remind the audience of his abilities, which both performers successfully accomplished. The finish saw an incredible back suplex from Nakamura to Knight, leading to a brutal-looking reverse DDT on the champ. This set up Knight to take a nasty running knee (Nakamura’s finisher, the Kinshasa) to the back of his head. The former Intercontinental Champion has now regained the United States Championship in dominating fashion.</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="7fa90b385ef15b996cee19a1a983ec00" data-recommend-id="image://7fa90b385ef15b996cee19a1a983ec00" data-format="jpg" data-width="3936" data-height="2624" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Gunther standing victoriously" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Gunther standing victoriously" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="getty" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->WWE<!-- --> (<!-- -->Getty Images<!-- -->)</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="7fa90b385ef15b996cee19a1a983ec00" data-recommend-id="image://7fa90b385ef15b996cee19a1a983ec00" data-format="jpg" data-width="3936" data-height="2624" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Gunther standing victoriously" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p><strong>Last Month’s Ranking:</strong> No. 2</p><p><strong>Last Month’s Segments: </strong>After losing to WWE Undisputed World Champion Cody Rhodes at Crown Jewel last month, World Champion Gunther has struggled to maintain his confidence. In the build-up to Survivor Series, former World Champion Damian Priest often got the upper hand on Gunther during in-ring segments and even during a backstage altercation that Gunther initiated. The rivalry has been compelling, although it’s been challenging to convince fans that Priest would win the world title in Vancouver.</p><p><strong>Survivor Series In-Ring Performance:</strong> In something of a clash of styles, Gunther looked to neutralize Priest’s mixed martial arts moves by attacking his left arm throughout the battle, even adding additional pressure with a devastating kimura lock that had Priest writhing in pain. The outcome of the match was determined by Priest’s former best friend and stablemate in The Judgment Day, Finn Balor. Balor interfered by hitting a double foot stomp on Priest, who was on the floor outside, while the referee was distracted (surprise, surprise) by Gunther. The WWE World Champion capitalized on this, power-bombing the New York native and putting him to sleep with a sleeper hold. Another great outing from both competitors.</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="c6c0c83d9f002c934c39f28e7f8e5636" data-recommend-id="image://c6c0c83d9f002c934c39f28e7f8e5636" data-format="jpg" data-width="6192" data-height="4128" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Candice LeRae entering competition" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Candice LeRae entering competition" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="getty" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->WWE<!-- --> (<!-- -->Getty Images<!-- -->)</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="c6c0c83d9f002c934c39f28e7f8e5636" data-recommend-id="image://c6c0c83d9f002c934c39f28e7f8e5636" data-format="jpg" data-width="6192" data-height="4128" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Candice LeRae entering competition" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p><strong>Last Month’s Ranking: </strong>N/A</p><p><strong>Last Month’s Segments:</strong> In recent weeks, the 39-year-old California native has enjoyed well-deserved success. After winning the WWE Women’s Speed Championship in October, Candice LeRae continues to gain momentum. In the lead-up to the Women’s WarGames match, LeRae was aligned with WWE Women’s Champion Nia Jax on SmackDown, often assisting Jax during matches. LeRae played a supporting role during the build to Survivor Series, participating in post-match brawls with the good guys.</p><p><strong>Survivor Series In-Ring Performance:</strong> LeRae, a talent who rarely gets the opportunity to fully showcase her abilities in a WWE ring, seized her moment at Survivor Series. Teaming up with current Women’s World Champion Liv Morgan, Nia Jax, current Money in the Bank briefcase holder Tiffany Stratton, and Morgan’s bodyguard Raquel Rodriguez, LeRae faced the challenge of standing out in a star-studded lineup—and she delivered spectacularly.</p><p>LeRae made an immediate impact by pushing Stratton out of harm’s way and executing an impressive double maneuver, performing a Code Breaker on Bayley while simultaneously nailing a Senton on Naomi. She utilized a chair as a launch pad for the move, making it one of the most impressive highlights of the night. LeRae epitomized the concept of making every moment in the ring count, solidifying herself as a standout performer in the chaotic Women’s WarGames match.</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="d446d22b01550cff0c0e3f338cfa4303" data-recommend-id="image://d446d22b01550cff0c0e3f338cfa4303" data-format="jpg" data-width="6192" data-height="4128" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="The New Bloodline ready to fight" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="The New Bloodline ready to fight" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="getty" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->WWE<!-- --> (<!-- -->Getty Images<!-- -->)</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="d446d22b01550cff0c0e3f338cfa4303" data-recommend-id="image://d446d22b01550cff0c0e3f338cfa4303" data-format="jpg" data-width="6192" data-height="4128" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="The New Bloodline ready to fight" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p><strong>Last Month’s Ranking: </strong>No. 8</p><p><strong>Survivor Series In-Ring Performance:</strong> The new Tribal Chief, Solo Sikoa, showcased his natural charisma and in-ring presence, solidifying himself as a credible threat to Roman Reigns. Sikoa wasted no time making an impact in the Bloodline match. Early on, he unleashed brutal violence on Jimmy and Jey Uso, slamming a steel door into their heads in a shocking display of dominance.</p><p>Taking charge of his bad-guy team (Tonga, Loa, Reed, and Fatu), Sikoa orchestrated a devastating beatdown of the good guys (Zayn, Punk, Jimmy, and Jey) in the ring. In a dramatic moment, Sikoa attempted to exile his cousin Reigns from the match by unveiling a steel chain and padlock, setting the stage for high-stakes drama. He came close to incapacitating Reigns with two Samoan Spikes, leading to a thrilling false finish. However, the Uso brothers countered with a perfectly timed double superkick.</p><p>Sikoa was pivotal in the match’s climactic moments, enduring an all-out assault by the babyfaces, ultimately falling to Reigns in a decisive conclusion. Despite the loss, Sikoa demonstrated his star potential, proving that his success hinges on the caliber of opponents and storylines he’s paired with.</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="9e720de88da21e60f28ca3e320425769" data-recommend-id="image://9e720de88da21e60f28ca3e320425769" data-format="jpg" data-width="5518" data-height="3679" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Jacob Fatu in the middle of action" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Jacob Fatu in the middle of action" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="getty" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->WWE<!-- --> (<!-- -->Getty Images<!-- -->)</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="9e720de88da21e60f28ca3e320425769" data-recommend-id="image://9e720de88da21e60f28ca3e320425769" data-format="jpg" data-width="5518" data-height="3679" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Jacob Fatu in the middle of action" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p><strong>Last Month’s Ranking: </strong>N/A</p><p><strong>Last Month’s Segments:</strong> Since debuting in WWE earlier this year, the “Samoan Werewolf” Jacob Fatu has been a force to be reckoned with, striking fear in his opponents from the start. Already a former WWE Tag Team Champion, Fatu is just beginning to make his mark. </p><p>Following his standout performance at WWE Crown Jewel, Fatu would often be the last man standing after on-screen brawls with the OG Bloodline, demonstrating his dominance. His momentum continued as he secured a critical victory against WarGames opponent and older cousin Jey Uso, earning his bad-guy Bloodline team the all-important WarGames advantage.</p><p><strong>Survivor Series In-Ring Performance:</strong> It’s clear that someone in WWE management sees immense potential in Jacob Fatu. Upon entering the cage, Fatu faced an immediate double-team from the Usos. While this would have been a major setback for most WWE superstars, the Samoan powerhouse quickly turned the tide. He neutralized Jimmy Uso by hurling the multi-time tag champion into the unforgiving steel frame of the cage and shrugged off a Samoan Drop from former Intercontinental Champion Jey Uso.</p><p>Fatu displayed incredible athleticism, hitting a breathtaking handstand springboard moonsault on Jey Uso, showcasing his unique blend of power and agility. However, the match took a scary turn when Fatu appeared to botch a top-rope move intended for CM Punk, resulting in legitimate pain to his leg. Despite this setback, the resilient Bloodline member pushed through to finish the match, proving his toughness and determination.</p><p>It’s safe to say that Jacob Fatu, the younger cousin of the Usos and older cousin of Solo Sikoa, has solidified his place as a rising star in WWE. His performance at Survivor Series confirmed he is here to stay.</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="0e671d482cb665d4fb1a30be6c3564d1" data-recommend-id="image://0e671d482cb665d4fb1a30be6c3564d1" data-format="jpg" data-width="8134" data-height="5425" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Boston Reed jumping off a steel cage" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Boston Reed jumping off a steel cage" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="getty" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->WWE<!-- --> (<!-- -->Getty Images<!-- -->)</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="0e671d482cb665d4fb1a30be6c3564d1" data-recommend-id="image://0e671d482cb665d4fb1a30be6c3564d1" data-format="jpg" data-width="8134" data-height="5425" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Boston Reed jumping off a steel cage" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p><strong>Last Month’s Ranking: </strong>No. 6</p><p><strong>Last Month’s Segments:</strong> With Seth Rollins currently in his rearview, Bronson Reed turned his attention to his next challenge. Reed defeated former World Champion Rollins on <em>Monday Night Raw</em>, leading to Rollins’ removal from current storylines once again. The “Big” superstar made a significant impact on the November 15th edition of <em>WWE SmackDown</em>, aligning himself with the Bloodline in preparation for a massive 5-on-5 WarGames cage match at Survivor Series. </p><p>During a beatdown of the OG Bloodline, Reed hit a monstrous “Tsunami” on Roman Reigns, which the Original Tribal Chief sold as though his ribs were cracked—an incredible compliment from WWE’s top superstar. Reed fit right in with the Bloodline and carried serious momentum going into the premium live event.</p><p><strong>Survivor Series In-Ring Performance:</strong> Not only is Reed impressive at his size, but his instincts should be lauded. During the WarGames match, he took control of an unfortunate situation when his tag partner Jacob Fatu missed a moonsault attempt by quickly hitting a Senton on Fatu’s intended target, CM Punk. Another huge spot in the match was Bronson climbing to the top of the cage, aiming to crush Reigns, who was laid out on a table. </p><p>However, Punk pulled Reigns out of the way, causing Reed to crash through the table. Despite his team losing to Sami Zayn, The Usos, CM Punk, and Roman Reigns, Bronson undoubtedly established himself as a top performer.</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="25bfef0cc13e3b253348fab6473566bb" data-recommend-id="image://25bfef0cc13e3b253348fab6473566bb" data-format="jpg" data-width="6192" data-height="4128" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Iyo Sky getting ready to enter the ring" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Iyo Sky getting ready to enter the ring" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="getty" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->WWE<!-- --> (<!-- -->Getty Images<!-- -->)</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="25bfef0cc13e3b253348fab6473566bb" data-recommend-id="image://25bfef0cc13e3b253348fab6473566bb" data-format="jpg" data-width="6192" data-height="4128" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Iyo Sky getting ready to enter the ring" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p><strong>Last Month’s Ranking:</strong> N/A</p><p><strong>Last Month’s Segments:</strong> The original Damage Control (stylized as Damage CTRL) member has gained momentum lately. After recently winning a battle royal to determine who would face World Champion Liv Morgan, the “Genius of the Sky” found herself involved in the 5-on-5 WarGames match at Survivor Series. Iyo Sky’s introduction to this storyline added significant value, as she brings experience and unmatched natural athleticism.</p><p><strong>Survivor Series In-Ring Performance:</strong> Sky never disappoints in high-pressure environments. From her introduction to the match, Sky commanded attention as she executed a breathtaking moonsault from the top of the cage, with a purple garbage can covering half her body, eliciting a roar of approval from the audience. The former NXT Champion more than earned her spot on this list with her bravery and consistently impressive moveset.</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="5ef7138e45fbf2adf3d66578c2890d2c" data-recommend-id="image://5ef7138e45fbf2adf3d66578c2890d2c" data-format="jpg" data-width="6192" data-height="4128" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Liv Morgan and Raquel Rodriquez entering the match" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Liv Morgan and Raquel Rodriquez entering the match" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="getty" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->WWE<!-- --> (<!-- -->Getty Images<!-- -->)</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="5ef7138e45fbf2adf3d66578c2890d2c" data-recommend-id="image://5ef7138e45fbf2adf3d66578c2890d2c" data-format="jpg" data-width="6192" data-height="4128" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Liv Morgan and Raquel Rodriquez entering the match" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p><strong>Last Month’s Ranking:</strong> No. 7</p><p><strong>Last Month’s Segments:</strong> Liv Morgan focused on maintaining her momentum following her historic win at this year’s WWE Crown Jewel event in Saudi Arabia. After weeks of tensions with Iyo Sky and WWE Tag Champions Jade Cargill and Bianca Belair, a match between them became inevitable. On a recent edition of Monday Night Raw, Iyo Sky earned the opportunity to challenge Morgan, further intensifying the rivalry with the “Genius of the Sky.”<br></p><p>The WWE Women’s World Champion, alongside her bodyguard Raquel Rodriguez, was unsuccessful in defeating Cargill and Belair for the tag titles, foreshadowing a potential rematch. Following an attack on Cargill during an episode of WWE SmackDown, former WWE Champion Bayley was added to the mix, setting the stage for the 5-on-5 Survivor Series WarGames match.</p><p><strong>Survivor Series In-Ring Performance:</strong> One thing that stands out about Morgan is her unmatched ability to sell danger. When the World Champion entered the match, she locked eyes with Rhea Ripley, who glared at her with pure hatred. This prompted Morgan to grab a bat in an effort to defend herself. She attempted to cripple Ripley with bat swings reminiscent of Juan Soto’s World Series highlights.</p><p>More creativity came when Morgan executed her Oblivion finisher on Bayley while Bayley was holding a chair. Although the move didn’t look as impressive as likely intended, it was unique enough to be appreciated. Ripley ultimately defeated Team Liv, surprisingly pinning Morgan.</p><p>Despite some sloppy moments in the match (such as Nia Jax mistiming spots, including weak chair shots on Naomi and Bayley), the finish was strong, and the crowd appeared to thoroughly enjoy it. Morgan continues to be a shining light whenever she’s on television.</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="6ba9e30e2d2b337a316810ae80b3ad40" data-recommend-id="image://6ba9e30e2d2b337a316810ae80b3ad40" data-format="jpg" data-width="6192" data-height="4128" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Rhea Ripley staring at the match to come" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Rhea Ripley staring at the match to come" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="getty" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->WWE<!-- --> (<!-- -->Getty Images<!-- -->)</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="6ba9e30e2d2b337a316810ae80b3ad40" data-recommend-id="image://6ba9e30e2d2b337a316810ae80b3ad40" data-format="jpg" data-width="6192" data-height="4128" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Rhea Ripley staring at the match to come" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p><strong>Last Month’s Ranking:</strong> N.A</p><p><strong>Last Month’s Segments:</strong> After returning to WWE television following an eye injury, former Women’s World Champion Rhea Ripley’s primary objective each week was to destroy the women who kept her out of action for weeks. Ripley versus Liv Morgan inside a steel structure felt like a natural progression. Now sporting a protective face mask, the former Judgment Day member was highly motivated, telling her tag partners for WarGames that she was solely focused on Morgan. Generally speaking, this was the less intriguing of the two advertised WarGames matches. However, the subplot of “who attacked Jade” added an adequate amount of interest.</p><p><strong>Survivor Series In-Ring Performance:</strong> As soon as Ripley left the cage, all the bad guys (Nia Jax and Raquel Rodriguez) in the ring waited to confront her, showcasing her intimidation factor. Amid chants of “This is awesome” from the audience, Ripley displayed her brawling prowess by breaking a toilet seat over Rodriguez’s back.</p><p>The 28-year-old superstar also demonstrated her intelligence during the match, capitalizing on her tag partner Iyo Sky’s use of a fire extinguisher to handcuff Rodriguez. The match’s finish saw Ripley deliver a devastating Riptide finisher to Morgan off the ropes and through a table. It was a satisfying conclusion to a rough WarGames match and a strong reminder of why Ripley has remained near the top of WWE’s pecking order for years.</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="7c20367f0c0bcb587c7715427e0ce744" data-recommend-id="image://7c20367f0c0bcb587c7715427e0ce744" data-format="jpg" data-width="6192" data-height="4128" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Roman Reigns leading the way" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Roman Reigns leading the way" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="getty" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->WWE<!-- --> (<!-- -->Getty Images<!-- -->)</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="7c20367f0c0bcb587c7715427e0ce744" data-recommend-id="image://7c20367f0c0bcb587c7715427e0ce744" data-format="jpg" data-width="6192" data-height="4128" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Roman Reigns leading the way" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p><strong>Last Month’s Ranking:</strong> No. 5</p><p><strong>Last Month’s Segments:</strong> The Original Tribal Chief has been trying to get his hands on his real-life cousin Solo Sikoa for months, eager to face him in a one-on-one match, though Sikoa has made it clear he’s not interested. The new Bloodline leader defeated the former World Champion at Crown Jewel in a tag team match, serving as a catalyst for the buildup to WarGames at Survivor Series.</p><p>In the weeks leading up to the event, Reigns and his cousins, Jimmy and Jey Uso, were searching for teammates for Survivor Series. After finally convincing OG Bloodline member Sami Zayn to rejoin their team, the good guys were still in need of a fifth member to complete the qualifications for the 5-on-5 match. In a shocking twist, the returning “Wise Man,” WWE Hall of Famer Paul Heyman, introduced the fifth member for the OG Bloodline team: none other than the original “Paul Heyman Guy,” CM Punk.</p><p>Reigns shares an extensive history with Punk, as the former World Champion served as a mercenary for Punk during his debut. This made for absolutely extraordinary television leading up to the 38th annual Survivor Series event.</p><p><strong>Survivor Series In-Ring Performance:</strong> Upon entering the ring, Reigns looked spectacular, scaling the WarGames cage (after Sikoa attempted to lock him out with his own chain) and hitting a diving crossbody on Tama Tonga, Tonga Loa, Jacob Fatu, Bronson Reed, and Solo Sikoa. Even while focused on his offense, Reigns ensured the story of the match remained intact. At one point, Reigns helped each of his teammates to their feet—except Punk—adding tension to their dynamic. This seemed to be a response to Punk pushing Reigns aside (similar to Candice LeRae in her match) to enter the match before him, upsetting the Original Tribal Chief.</p><p>Reigns continued to dominate, landing a low blow on Fatu and delivering a massive spear to Solo. The Head of the Table secured the win after all of his teammates (Sami Zayn, Jimmy and Jey Uso, and CM Punk) surrounded Sikoa, allowing each to land a shot on him. Punk hit the Go to Sleep on Solo, and Reigns finished the match with a bone-rattling spear, earning the elusive pinfall victory. It was an outstanding way to end Survivor Series.</p></div></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

This quick-paced move isn’t available to everyone on the roster, however. So let’s go over how to use it and which characters can pull it off.</p><h2 id="h15416"><a id="perform"></a>How To Perform A Delta Heavy Finish (Tri-Attack)</h2><figure id="" data-id="833254abf5e79b572e96fd105fbf014a" data-recommend-id="image://833254abf5e79b572e96fd105fbf014a" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Super Vegito’s list of Rush Chain Actions highlights his Delta Heavy Finish attack." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Super Vegito’s list of Rush Chain Actions highlights his Delta Heavy Finish attack." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Bandai Namco / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="833254abf5e79b572e96fd105fbf014a" data-recommend-id="image://833254abf5e79b572e96fd105fbf014a" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Super Vegito’s list of Rush Chain Actions highlights his Delta Heavy Finish attack." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Delta Heavy Finish is only available to some characters and through a specific combo route. <strong>You can do a Delta Heavy Finish in <em>Dragon Ball: Sparking Zero</em> at the end of a Rush Chain.</strong> Be sure to double-check a character’s list of Rush Chain Actions. Some do have the Heavy Finishes Chain, but can only follow up with a Heavy Crush combo.</p><p>The inputs for the initial Rush Chain depend on the character. Some might need only one pair of Rush Attack and Ki Blast inputs (X/Y and Square/Triangle for Xbox and PlayStation respectively), while others might need four of the former. Delta Heavy Finish is thankfully the same no matter the fighter: <strong>Once your opponent is stunned by the Rush Chain, quickly tilt the left stick up and press Ki Blast, followed by two Rush Attack inputs.</strong> Perform it quickly enough and you’ll see your character dish out a three-part Vanish combo that ends with a Ki Blast to send the target flying. Make sure to use the entire input chain. The opponent will recover very quickly if you end the chain early.</p><p><strong>Read More:</strong> <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/dragon-ball-sparking-zero-rush-super-landing-guide-1851673589&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/dragon-ball-sparking-zero-rush-super-landing-guide-1851673589"><em>Dragon Ball: Sparking Zero</em>’s Rush Supers Can Be A Super-Rush Once Mastered</a></span></p><p>A notable difference from the original Tri-Attack in previous games is that this newer version ends with a launcher instead of slamming the target downward. This is reminiscent of the Delta Combination attacks from prior titles, which could be why it’s called Delta Heavy Finisher. This change lets you follow up on the final hit just like any other launcher. A Dragon Smash works just as well as more Vanishing Attacks or a Lightning Attack. You can also combo into a Rush Super or Ultimate Blast either.</p><h2 id="h15417"><a id=""></a>Which Characters Can Perform A Tri-Attack (Or, Rather, Who Cannot)</h2><figure id="" data-id="107e73d7ef3bae4ee1c8ee98a03f3edf" data-recommend-id="image://107e73d7ef3bae4ee1c8ee98a03f3edf" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Vegito Blue uses the final hit of the Delta Heavy Finisher to launch Jiren into the air." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Vegito Blue uses the final hit of the Delta Heavy Finisher to launch Jiren into the air." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Bandai Namco / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="107e73d7ef3bae4ee1c8ee98a03f3edf" data-recommend-id="image://107e73d7ef3bae4ee1c8ee98a03f3edf" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Vegito Blue uses the final hit of the Delta Heavy Finisher to launch Jiren into the air." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Keeping track of who can make use of the Delta Heavy Finisher is a little tricky. <strong>The good news is that most of the roster has access to the Delta Heavy Finisher.</strong> However, aside from <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/dragon-ball-sparking-zero-character-class-type-1851708385&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/dragon-ball-sparking-zero-character-class-type-1851708385">Giant-type characters</a></span> and those who generally run on the larger size not being able to perform the technique, there isn’t any clear-cut reasoning for whether it’s available to someone or not.

And speaking of expansions, <em>The Storybook Vale</em> hasn’t shied away from adding a wide variety of new meals and new ingredients to make them. One of these ingredients—Salt Crystals— can seem a bit elusive at first, but it’s really not that hard to find.</p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="197298" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="Live Forever in the Universe of 'New World: Aeternum'" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="108" data-playlist="197298,197284,197260" data-current="197298"><div><p>Live Forever in the Universe of 'New World: Aeternum'</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197298/197298_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197298/197298_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197298/197298_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197298/197298_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"></video></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>That being said, obtaining a full stack of Salt Crystals can be a bit time-consuming, so we’ll tell you where to find this ingredient in <em>The Storybook Vale</em> and how to stock up on it faster.</p><h2 id="h17510"><a id="location"></a>Where To Find Salt Crystals In <em>The Storybook Vale</em></h2><p>If you’ve glanced at Salt Crystals in your collection menu, you’ve no doubt seen that it lists all four sections from the Everafter as locations to obtain the ingredient. However, clearing the way to all of these areas doesn’t reveal anything to harvest or purchase to grant you Salt Crystals. That’s because this ingredient is, strangely, only obtained via fishing.</p><p><strong>Salt Crystals are caught by fishing in the Everafter biome</strong>. But before you go casting your lure into the colorful pools scattered through this darkly magical section of <em>The Storybook Vale</em>, it’s important to remember that <strong>Salt Crystals can only be obtained by fishing outside of pools</strong>.</p><figure id="" data-id="457b0ed192e306e9c996812439678ab5" data-recommend-id="image://457b0ed192e306e9c996812439678ab5" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A large Salt Crystal hovers on the screen." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A large Salt Crystal hovers on the screen." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Disney / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="457b0ed192e306e9c996812439678ab5" data-recommend-id="image://457b0ed192e306e9c996812439678ab5" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A large Salt Crystal hovers on the screen." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Unfortunately, this ingredient shares a spawn with fish, so not every cast will earn you a Salt Crystal. But make sure that you bring along a fishing friend so that you’ll earn a second Salt Crystal each time you fish one up. Keep at it long enough and you’ll have yourself a full stack of this spice.</p><h2 id="h17511"><a id="cook"></a>What Can You Cook With Salt Crystals?<br></h2><p>These meals all require Salt Crystals to cook to perfection: <br></p><ul data-type="List" data-style="Bullet"><li>A Very Unusual Tea-Time - Salt Crystal, Yogurt, Spiral Strawberry, Sour Berries</li><li>Aquatic Escargot - Salt Crystal, Trumpet Snail, Garlic</li><li>Arcane Garlic Whelk - Salt Crystal, Sorcerer Hat Hermit Crab, Garlic, Any Spice</li><li>Caprese Salad - Salt Crystal, Any Vegetable, Olives, Flyleaf Feta, Any Spice</li><li>Grecian Fish Bake - Salt Crystal, Stygian Mudskipper, Elysian Grain, Olives, Ambrosia</li><li>Greek Potatoes - Salt Crystal, Potato, Garlic, Any Fruit, Any Spice</li><li>Salt-Baked Sea Wolf - Salt Crystal, Sea Wolf</li><li>Salt-Pickled Cauliflower - Salt Crystal, Cauliflower, Any Spice</li><li>Salt-Pickled Garlic - Salt Crystal, Garlic, Any Spice</li><li>Salt-Pickled Green Bean - Salt Crystal, Green Beans, Any Spice</li><li>Salt-Pickled Radicchio - Salt Crystal, Radicchio, Any Spice</li><li>Salt-Pickled Radish - Salt Crystal, Radish, Any Spice</li><li>Salt-Pickled Sea Grapes - Salt Crystal, Sea Grapes, Any Spice</li><li>Shovelbird Eggs Benedict - Salt Crystal, Elysian Grain, Shovelbird Egg, Spiral, Strawberry</li><li>Soda Bread &amp; Feta - Salt Crystal, Wheat, Flyleaf Feta</li></ul><p>Granted, with <em>The Storybook Vale</em>’s second half coming at a later date, there is almost certain to be additional meals added that make use of Salt Crystals in the future. So make sure you stock up ahead of time to make your life easier!</p><p>.<br></p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
