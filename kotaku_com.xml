No, it’s not like there was a recent golden era where the news bulletins were packed with incessant good cheer, but we’re a species that’s still reeling from the trauma of covid, inundated by news of wars, suffering, and the inevitable consequences of capitalism’s unchecked overreach, all while major nations elect cruel people incapable of tying their own shoelaces. </p><p>As I looked through the feeds and wires this morning, it all just felt too heavy. And honestly, under that weight, I couldn’t bring myself to plaster on a smile and report the (genuinely fun) news that Crocs are partnering with Nintendo to make <em>Animal Crossing</em>-themed plastic shoes. But no! I’m not going to let all the bad news squish me, and I don’t want it to squish you either. So instead I’ve put together a bunch of things that make me smile, that I want to share and hopefully cause you to smile too.</p><h2 id="h68724"><a id=""></a>Slings &amp; Arrows</h2><p>If you’ve met me in real life, there’s a very strong chance I’ve already recommended 2003's <em>Slings &amp; Arrows </em>to you, complete with terrible attempts on my part to deliver lines like main character Geoffrey Tennant (Paul Gross). Fortunately, you’ve likely been spared this, and instead I’ve put the scene I love to quote from above.</p><p><em>Slings &amp; Arrows</em> was a Canadian TV show, set in a fictional theater that hosts the annual New Burbage Shakespeare Festival. However, moments before the new season was due to start, director Oliver Welles (Stephen Ouimette) dies. The festival is forced to beg the return of Geoffrey Tennant, a former actor and director who left New Burbage after a massive falling out and a following  stint in a psychiatric facility. Each of the three six-episode seasons follows Tennant’s attempts to put on a specific Shakespeare play, battling against money-men, egos, and perhaps most of all, the ghost of Oliver Welles.</p><p>It is one of the most extraordinary pieces of television ever made. Its love for and knowledge of Shakespeare makes it an education, and its dark humor ensures it always feels punchy and passionate. Alongside the incredible Paul Gross (<em>Due South</em>’s Benton Fraser) is Martha Burns as Ellen Fanshaw, an actor coming to terms with now playing Gertrude rather than Ophelia, and <em>The Kids in the Hall</em>’s Mark McKinney as Richard Smith-Jones, a desperately useless manager who fails to please everyone.</p><p>All three seasons are a joy. Nearly every relationship is antagonistic, especially those between Geoffrey and absolutely everyone else, and yet the love and care and depth of understanding from the cast shines through it all in every moment. It is a thing of beauty that’ll make you want to understand Shakespeare more, just so you can feel like part of the gang. And if not, you’ve always got the glorious Seán Cullen’s sot critic, Basil, to have your back.</p><p>It’s not always easy to find these days, but <span><a data-ga="[]" href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/video/detail/0MNKEGPHP8XR0XYEU7AEBEUBW6?asc_campaign=kinjakotakulink-20&amp;asc_refurl=https://kotaku.com/saints-row-4-homestar-runner-sherlock-holmes-1851785792&amp;asc_source=&amp;tag=kinjakotakulink-20" target="_blank" rel="sponsored noopener noreferrer nofollow noskim" data-vtas-click="self:InlineUrl:inline-url-postbody" data-amazonasin="" data-amazontag="kinjakotakulink-20">right now you can buy it via Amazon</a></span>.</p><h2 id="h68725"><a id=""></a>Saints Row IV</h2><p>I will not tire of celebrating <em>Saints Row IV</em> in a world where I feel like this game gets short shrift. Here’s my declaration: <em>Saints Row IV</em> is funny in the most enormously elaborate ways. It’s a game that exists to make you laugh on  a vast scale. It feels like something that shouldn’t have been able to happen in an industry that’s so focused on the necessity of producing massive hits that it tends to shave the corners off everything to appeal to the widest audience possible. But <em>SRIV</em> thrives in its stupidity.</p><p>This is a game that begins with you disarming a nuclear missile you’re clung to while it’s in flight, crashing through the roof of the White House to be president, and then watching helpless as the entire world is destroyed by invading aliens. That’s the opening sequence. The rest of the game is set in a digital reproduction of the city from <em>Saints Row III</em>, all for the amusement of a tiresome alien overlord who comes across like a gormless boss who has no idea how disliked he is by his employees. Oh, and you now have superpowers.</p><p>This is a game that asked, “What if you could just do what you like?” Some people found it too much, too un-serious. I find it just a complete joy. And it helps that it delivers all these histrionics with the most incredible dialogue and acting. It’s just so, so funny. This is a game that gets the original actors back to re-enact the classic fight scene from <em>They Live</em> for <em>literally no sensible reason</em>. It just exists to be daft. And its closing joke over the credits made me laugh so hard I had tears streaming down my face.</p><p><em>Saints Row IV</em> is <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://store.steampowered.com/app/206420/Saints_Row_IV_ReElected/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/206420/Saints_Row_IV_ReElected/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">currently $5 in the Steam sale</a></span>.</p><h2 id="h68726"><a id=""></a>A Good Hang With Amy Poehler</h2><p>I strongly suspect that A Good Hang With Amy Poehler exists for the very same reason this article does. Poehler makes clear her express wish that this new podcast offer friendly laughter in a world on fire. And it succeeds.</p><p>The weekly show is 18 episodes in, which means both that there’s an excellent pool to choose from, and that you’re not arriving so late as to be daunted by the backlog. Guests have included Jack Black, Paul Rudd, Michelle Obama, and Quinta Brunson. And Will Forte, Natasha Lyonne, Seth Meyers and Idris Elba. And Martin Short. Oh, and Kathryn Hahn. Look, she gets the <em>best</em> guests. And the purpose of the conversation is just to cheerfully reminisce, tell funny tales, and goof around.</p><p>It’s so low stakes as to be glorious, and Poehler’s positivity and eagerness to listen causes everyone to be incredibly human. In most episodes it’s two friends catching up, which removes all the Celebrity Interview nonsense, so much so that guests often forget to plug anything. The latest episode, which went up just moments before I started writing, features Andy Samberg, and I just cannot wait to hear the two of them fondly remembering <em>SNL</em> and making each other laugh.</p><h2 id="h68727"><a id=""></a>Homestar Runner</h2><p>You either know and adore <em>Homestar Runner</em> and are wondering why someone would even think this needed recommending, or you’ve not heard of it and are about to become the former. </p><p><em>HSR</em> is, astonishingly, 25 years old now. It began as a Flash cartoon in 2000, an early internet phenomenon created by two brothers, Matt and Mike Chapman (The Brothers Chaps). It was, from the start, both incredibly funny and deeply strange. Its incredible cast of characters, almost entirely voiced by the incredibly versatile Matt Chapman, includes the eponymous doofus Homestar Runner, the wonderfully brash and cynical Strong Bad (and his pet, The Cheat), the greedy and corpulent King Of Town, and my favorite, the implausible and unbound-by-reality Homsar.</p><p>As well as being the most essential website of the early internet, it also spun off a series of Telltale-made episodic adventure games, and most recently a spoof point-and-click called <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://buried-treasure.org/2023/09/dangeresque-the-roomisode-triungulate/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://buried-treasure.org/2023/09/dangeresque-the-roomisode-triungulate/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>Dangeresque: The Roomisode Triungulate</em></a></span>. The latter has so many layers of <em>HSR</em> in-jokes as to be impenetrable to anyone but long-term fans, but gosh, there are so many long-term fans.</p><p>The great thing is, nearly everything from the original Flash site <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.youtube.com/@homestarrunnerdotcom&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.youtube.com/@homestarrunnerdotcom" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">has been preserved on YouTube</a></span>, with new cartoons still occasionally being made and uploaded there. And more recently, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://homestarrunner.com/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://homestarrunner.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">the old website</a></span> has been revived for the modern world, Flash-free but feature complete. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://homestarrunner.com/sbemails&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://homestarrunner.com/sbemails" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Including all 209 Strong Bad Emails!</a></span>&nbsp;</p><p>Whether you watched it all at the time or have never heard of it before, there are few better ways to distract yourself from all <em>that.</em></p><h2 id="h68728"><a id=""></a>The Beekeeper’s Picnic</h2><p>I have <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/the-beekeepers-picnic-sherlock-holmes-game-review-1851776762&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/the-beekeepers-picnic-sherlock-holmes-game-review-1851776762">gone on</a></span> and <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/2025-best-games-monster-hunter-split-fiction-avowed-1851767689/slides/8&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/2025-best-games-monster-hunter-split-fiction-avowed-1851767689/slides/8">on</a></span> about this game this year, and for really good reason. This gorgeous point-and-click adventure tells a new tale of Sherlock Holmes, following the adventures chronicled in Sir Arthur Conan Doyle’s novels, living in retirement after the First World War. When his erstwhile partner Watson returns from the front lines, Holmes welcomes him to his new Sussex home. Both are now elderly men, and Holmes—living in his rural idyll—is reflecting on just what a complete shit he was to Watson throughout his life. He simply wants to put together a picnic for his lifelong friend, so he can have a moment to tell the doctor what their friendship means to him.</p><p>You could interpret this as quite twee, but creator Helen Greetham is an expert in all things Sherlock Holmes, and by rooting the game in the stories—most especially by cleverly evoking the events at the end of the short story “The Adventure of the Three Garridebs”—Holmes’s motivations are grounded and understandable.</p><p>Sherlock Holmes tales are one of my happy places—most nights I’ll fall asleep listening to 1960s radio plays based on the stories, because they’re the perfect mix of gently entertaining and soporific. So yes, this is my wheelhouse. But I’m hardly alone! <em>The Beekeeper’s Picnic</em> understands the underlying gentleness of Doyle’s writing which often lies concealed just beneath Holmes’s acerbic nature, how he gives us a world in which smartness and wit always outdo cruelty and greed. Part of the game’s genius is that it gives us a tale of Holmes that exists entirely without the latter.</p><p><em>The Beekeeper’s Picnic</em> is <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://store.steampowered.com/app/2248890/The_Beekeepers_Picnic__A_Sherlockian_Adventure/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2248890/The_Beekeepers_Picnic__A_Sherlockian_Adventure/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">currently $11 in the Steam sale</a></span>.</p><p>.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://kotaku.com/saints-row-4-homestar-runner-sherlock-holmes-1851785792]]></content:encoded>

In 2017, <em>Danganronpa V3: Killing Harmony </em>seemingly ended Spike Chunsoft’s murder mystery series with a decisive metacommentary about letting art die with dignity. Four years later, after creative director Kazutaka Kodaka left the company, Spike Chunsoft released the obvious cash grab <em>Danganronpa S: Ultimate Summer Camp</em>, a gacha game universally maligned for stomping all over the series’ legacy (and for being a mediocre video game). Since then, the series has mostly gone away, with Kodaka releasing several <em>Danganronpa</em>-like projects over at his new studio, Too Kyo Games, like <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/master-detective-archives-switch-review-danganronpa-1850592843&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/master-detective-archives-switch-review-danganronpa-1850592843"><em>Master Detective Archives: Rain Code</em></a></span><em> </em>and <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/hundred-line-last-defense-academy-steam-switch-reviews-1851781786&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/hundred-line-last-defense-academy-steam-switch-reviews-1851781786"><em>The Hundred Line: Last Defense Academy</em></a></span>. For years, it seemed like <em>Danganronpa </em>might be well and truly dead, until last night when one of the stars of the series’ English dubs posted a cryptic tweet that has put the community in a tizzy.</p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="196646" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="Dragon’s Dogma 2’s New Class Is A Twirling Death Machine" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="137" data-playlist="196646,196215,197544" data-current="196646"><div><p>Dragon’s Dogma 2’s New Class Is A Twirling Death Machine</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196646/196646_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196646/196646_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196646/196646_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196646/196646_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/22202.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>Brian Beacock, the English voice behind Monokuma, the series’ masochistic teddy bear villain, posted a tweet of the evil animatronic bear laughing, with the caption “11.25.2025.” There’s no other context for this in the post, so fans have a lot of empty space in which to speculate. Could this be a tease for something new in the <em>Danganronpa </em>series after nearly a decade without a mainline entry?</p><p>Notably, November 25 will be the 15th anniversary of the release of the original <em>Danganronpa: Trigger Happy Havoc</em> on the PlayStation Portable way back in 2010. It’s entirely possible this might not be a new game, but some kind of event commemorating the anniversary. There’s really nothing to go on here, so fans are running wild and theorizing everything from a remake of the original game to a <em>Dead by Daylight </em>crossover.</p><p>While some think a new game may be coming, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/danganronpa/comments/1luagnj/brian_beacock_the_voice_of_monokuma/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/danganronpa/comments/1luagnj/brian_beacock_the_voice_of_monokuma/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">others are a bit more skeptical</a></span>. If a new <em>Danganronpa </em>game were coming, it seems unlikely that the first tease would be from one of the English voice actors, rather than some kind of worldwide, coordinated effort from Spike Chunsoft. Whatever it is, we will only have to wait four long months to find out. Need something to do in the meantime? Play <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/hundred-line-last-defense-academy-review-danganronpa-1851777031&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/hundred-line-last-defense-academy-review-danganronpa-1851777031"><em>The Hundred Line: Last Defense Academy</em></a></span>. Sure, it’s not a murder mystery, but it’s still one of Kodaka’s most ambitious works, and it deserves more attention as we head into Game of the Year season in December. </p></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://kotaku.com/new-danganronpa-4-brian-beacock-monokuma-tease-dbd-1851785794]]></content:encoded>

Some Catholics believe in first, second, and third class relics, just like the Ghostbusters’ numbering system for haunted artifacts, but it’s hard to find strict, codified definitions by the Church. Because the cards don’t belong to Pope Leo XIV and aren’t regularly used by him, but have come into contact with his hands, they might count as third class relics. It’s unclear if that means they’re banned at official tournaments. </p><p>.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://kotaku.com/pope-leo-xiv-pokemon-card-autograph-popplio-meme-1851785788]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Commanders, prepare for deployment. <em>Girls’ Frontline 2: Exilium</em> is rolling out a series of updates to help bolster your squad, vanquish enemies, and purify contaminated zones.</p><p>For the uninitiated,<em> GFL2</em> is a 3D strategy RPG available on PC, iOS, and Android. You take on the role of Commander, leading Tactical Dolls (T-Dolls) — stylish androids modeled after real-world weapons — through turn-based battles, exploration, and an unfolding post-apocalyptic storyline.</p><p>From July 3 - 23, a Targeted Procurement Event will feature three elite T-Dolls: Springfield, Peri, and Mechty. Springfield is a brand-new character addition, while Mechty is a valuable re-release for players who missed out on pulling her previously.</p><p>New elite weapons will be introduced to the banner pool as well, with each tailored to their wielder’s distinctive strengths and personas.</p><p>Inspired by the M1903 and enhanced for futuristic combat, Springfield’s “Radiance”—its name reflecting the holder’s warm, maternal nature—boasts improved maneuverability and firing speed. With its combination of power and velocity, the rifle complements Springfield’s versatility as a fighter and supporter on the battlefield.</p><p>Beneath the alluring exterior of Peri’s “Amanita” lies devastating power. Based on the MP5H1, the submachine gun features enhanced internals that boost its stopping power significantly and, in effect, compromise enemies quickly. It’s an ideal match for Peri’s quiet charm and deadly cunning.</p><p>The “Hestia” is compact but lethal. Modeled after the CZ75, the handgun is an extension of Faye’s fiery nature; a force to be reckoned with in close combat.</p><p>Speaking of Faye, she’ll also be available to acquire during this time frame via an updated Standard Procurement Banner for free. If you’re a new player or someone looking to round out their T-Doll roster, you can nab Faye for free by completing a handful of in-game tasks.</p><figure id="" data-id="9b6d090ea30380c7f5f24aa68e95e957" data-recommend-id="image://9b6d090ea30380c7f5f24aa68e95e957" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="false" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->SUNBORN</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="9b6d090ea30380c7f5f24aa68e95e957" data-recommend-id="image://9b6d090ea30380c7f5f24aa68e95e957" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>For those interested in upping their style game, all previous skins will return with limited-time discounts, as well as new outfits and weapon skins.</p><p>Springfield’s “Queen in Radiance” navy blue dress looks the part, but it also happens to be the game’s first outfit to feature a 3D main screen wallpaper, on which Commanders can interact and dance with Springfield.</p><p>Faye’s Flurry-Crimson outfit matches her temperament to a tee, tailored for silent efficiency. Meanwhile, you can add a touch of artistry to your firepower with the Midnight Waltz and Dawn Sentry weapon skins. The former gives Wednesday Addams vibes with its blueish-purple stock and black barrel. The haunting skin is fitting for Commanders who look to strike in Night Battle Missions. Its counterpart, the Dawn Sentry, has a yellowish-gold action that reflects the ultimate mission of the game: fight for a new, brighter day.</p><p>The outfits and skins will be sold at a discount at the Payment Center. You just need a Sunborn Account to purchase them.</p><p>This past holiday weekend, for fans of the 3D strategy game, the action didn’t stop with their adventures on the small screen. The MICA team brought the excitement of <em>Girls’ Frontline 2: Exilium</em> to life at the 2025 Anime Expo at the Los Angeles Convention Center.</p><figure id="" data-id="b991f0ef966a00543a5985ff48208e1d" data-recommend-id="image://b991f0ef966a00543a5985ff48208e1d" data-format="jpg" data-width="2048" data-height="1366" data-lightbox="true" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="false" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->SUNBORN</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="b991f0ef966a00543a5985ff48208e1d" data-recommend-id="image://b991f0ef966a00543a5985ff48208e1d" data-format="jpg" data-width="2048" data-height="1366" data-lightbox="true" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>From July 3 - 6, <em>GFL2</em> welcomed Commanders to their booth, which was designed after the fan-favorite Zucchero Cafe—the new Doll Spring field is the manager. Cosplayers dressed as four characters—Springfield, Makiatto, Centaureissi, and Sharkry—were on-site to interact with convention-goers, make and sell drinks, and unlock rewards.</p><p>At the Training Range, Commanders squared off in a one-on-one target battle, while the Café Life Interaction Zone offered attendees the opportunity to earn a Zucchero Cookie Badge and a Lucky Draw Coupon. One Lucky Draw was held per day at the activation, giving fans the chance to win Acrylic Shikishis, Figures, Leva Acrylic Blocks, Perpetual Calendar Phone Stands, and other prizes.</p><p><br>The T-Doll and weaponry rate drops, outfits, and skins are only sticking around for a limited time (July 3 - 23), so get your hands on the loot while you can. And if you’re in the L.A. area over July 4 weekend, experience the world of <em>Girls’ Frontline 2: Exilium</em> IRL and snag that exclusive merch. </p></div></div><br/><br/>https://kotaku.com/girls-frontline-2-exilium-anime-expo-limited-drop-1851785787]]></content:encoded>
