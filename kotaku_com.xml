No 25 percent tax on the the Nintendo Switch that Christmas. The PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X/S launched the following year to pandemic-driven shortages rather than tariff-led price hikes. The video game industry moved forward. </p><p>But four years later, Trump has won re-election on a promise to impose even higher tariffs on everything Americans buy. That includes a proposed 60 percent import tax on anything assembled in China and a 10-20 percent import tax on anything else made outside the U.S. On November 25, the president-elect promised that new tariffs on goods from China as well as Mexico and Canada would be <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://thehill.com/business/5009285-trump-new-tariffs-canada-mexico-china/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://thehill.com/business/5009285-trump-new-tariffs-canada-mexico-china/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">a day-one priority</a></span>.

No one thinks gaming consoles will start being manufactured in the U.S. any time soon. </p><h2 id="h163621"><a id=""></a>No mid-gen price cut in sight </h2><p> Some industry observers and experts think an emboldened Trump is less likely to retreat this time around. “I think companies have been taking it very seriously this time,” Mary Lovely, economics professor at Syracuse University’s Maxwell School of Citizenship and Public Affairs, told <em>Kotaku</em> in a phone interview. She worries that even if Trump starts with a lower opening bid than a 60 percent tariff on China, there’s potential for a reignited trade war to quickly escalate out of control. “That’s what he’s threatening, that’s what we could face.”</p><p>Tariffs are taxes imposed on goods imported into the country.

The changes aren’t one-to-one. A 60 percent tariff doesn’t necessarily mean a PS5 or Xbox Series X made in China will suddenly cost $800 at Walmart or Best Buy. But experts tend to agree that the majority of the tax will hit customers’ pocketbooks instead of companies’ bottom lines. Walmart, Best Buy, and other stores <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.reuters.com/markets/us/walmart-other-us-companies-raise-concerns-over-proposed-trump-tariffs-2024-11-19/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.reuters.com/markets/us/walmart-other-us-companies-raise-concerns-over-proposed-trump-tariffs-2024-11-19/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">are already saying</a></span> the results would still lead to dramatic price increases compared to what people are paying now. </p><p>The Consumer Technology Association (CTA), a trade group representing hundreds of companies that would be impacted by the tariffs, released a report in October claiming that tariffs would raise prices for consumers by roughly 40 percent when it comes to gaming consoles and related products. “American  consumers would pay $7 billion more for video  game consoles,” <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://shop.cta.tech/products/how-the-proposed-trump-tariffs-increase-prices-for-consumer-technology-products&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://shop.cta.tech/products/how-the-proposed-trump-tariffs-increase-prices-for-consumer-technology-products" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">the report claimed</a></span>. “As a result,” it goes on to forecast, “U.S. consumers  reduce overall purchases by 57 percent.” Accessories and related products, from charging cables to TVs, would also get more expensive. </p><p>“The model we used assumes that suppliers pass all extra costs of the tariffs onto consumers,” Richard Kowalski, CTA’s Senior Director of Business Intelligence, told <em>Kotaku </em>in an email. “The model also assumes that the tariffs incentivize some alternative sourcing. But given the limited amount of alternative sources available, most game consoles would still come from China.” </p><figure id="" data-id="c5e57703a44ad218c6380d695bde6203" data-recommend-id="image://c5e57703a44ad218c6380d695bde6203" data-format="png" data-width="1345" data-height="835" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A screenshot of the CTA's report shows projected price hikes for tech products.

Nvidia graphics cards for building gaming PCs would see similar spikes, as would the growing line of PC gaming handhelds like the Steam Deck and Asus Rog Ally. The Switch 2, expected to arrive as early as March 2025, could see its year-one sales torpedoed by the sudden sticker shock of a hybrid console almost twice as expensive in the U.S. as its predecessor. </p><p>Nintendo is one gaming company that’s already started moving some manufacturing out of China and into neighboring Vietnam. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://x.com/gibbogame?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://x.com/gibbogame?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">David Gibson</a></span>, Senior Analyst at MST Financial, estimates that roughly 50 percent of Switches are made outside of China this point, but he still foresees prices going up by as much as 35 percent if the current proposed tariffs go into effect.</p><p>Alternatively, Nintendo could try to reserve its Switch stock made outside of China for the U.S. market, which makes up roughly 40 percent of the global console market. He also estimates that PS5 manufacturing is closer to 70 percent in China and 30 percent in Japan and elsewhere, meaning costs would rise even more for Sony’s hardware. Microsoft’s Xbox, on the other hands, already has a much more <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.cnbc.com/2020/03/24/satya-nadella-hardware-supply-chain-coming-back-for-xbox-surface.html&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.cnbc.com/2020/03/24/satya-nadella-hardware-supply-chain-coming-back-for-xbox-surface.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">diversified manufacturing base</a></span>, in addition to the fact that the company has spent much of 2024 downplaying the significance of selling new consoles. </p><p>How would companies respond in the meantime? Gibson suggests Nintendo, Sony and others will look to increase imports ahead of Trump being sworn in on January 20 and begin shifting even more manufacturing capacity to other countries like India. “I would expect a full shift to non-China production within 12-24 months of the news,” he wrote in an email to <em>Kotaku</em>. “[It] usually takes 6 months to put in equipment and longer to find or build facilities.” By that point, the costs could be closer to 10 percent above what they are now, and companies like Sony might look to absorb more of them in a hit to profit margins to continue growing the PS5 install base. Lovely, however, suggested other countries aren’t ready to absorb that demand. “India’s just not ready,” she said. </p><h2 id="h163622"><a id=""></a>Tariffs could radically alter gaming’s trajectory </h2><p>But higher hardware costs are just the start of how tariffs could reshape gaming in the U.S. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://superjoost.substack.com/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://superjoost.substack.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Joost Van Dreunen</a></span>, a lecturer at the NYU Stern School of Business, believes the most draconian tariffs would dramatically reshape the console landscape in the years ahead. “The data indicate that tariffs would not just affect sales volumes but could permanently alter the console industry’s role in U.S. gaming culture,” he wrote in <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://substack.com/home/post/p-151531315&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://substack.com/home/post/p-151531315" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">a recent edition of his <em>Super Joost Playlist</em> newsletter</a></span>. In the worst-case scenario, he estimates that total console sales in the U.S. would fall below early 2000s levels “despite two decades of market expansion and a substantially larger gaming population.”</p><p>One likely outcome of this scenario, Van Dreunen speculates, is that players in the U.S. start moving toward other ways of accessing games. “These tariffs could fast-track the industry’s shift toward cloud gaming, streaming services, and transmedia distribution, marking a classic transition from content innovation to distribution innovation in the pendulum cycle,” he wrote. </p><p>Physical games would also potentially die off even faster as players switch to tariff-exempt digital downloads and cheaper, digital-only versions of the existing PlayStation and Xbox consoles.

Even if these tariffs are phased in, these costs will all be passed to consumers as there are no other equivalently priced options...while production may increase in the U.S., it will only do so at a higher consumer price relative to today. In the end, U.S. gamers will bear the burden of these taxes.”</p><p>Of course, all of this hinges on what actually happens in the next six months. If history’s any indication, Trump could threaten major tariffs only to back off of them in return for minor trading concessions from other countries, declaring victory despite minimal changes to the status quo. Big tech and gaming companies could also once again successfully lobby the incoming administration for exclusions from the highest tariff rates as they did back in 2019. That’s no doubt part of why several CEOs, including Microsoft’s Satya Nadella, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.axios.com/2024/11/07/trump-election-win-big-tech-ceos-congratulations&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.axios.com/2024/11/07/trump-election-win-big-tech-ceos-congratulations" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">recently rushed to congratulate Trump</a></span> on his electoral win. </p><p>Or, the president-elect could simply make good on one of his biggest campaign promises and spur a new wave of gaming price hikes after companies already raised prices following post-pandemic inflation. “If these tariffs go into effect, gamers can expect to pay significantly more for their next game console (as well as other products!),” the CTA’s Richard Kowalski wrote in an email to <em>Kotaku</em>. “Tariffs are taxes paid for by U.S. consumers and businesses, and they stifle innovation as companies divert scarce resources to tariff payments, not hiring American talent to work on cutting-edge technologies.”</p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

The sequel has already been controversial, as the feature film started off as a Disney+ series and has been reworked into a theatrical release. The seemingly panicked pivot to put a sequel to a successful film in theaters following the box office bomb of 2022’s <em>Strange World </em>and the disappointing performance of 2023’s <em>Wish</em> suggests that Disney is retreating to sequels above new ideas, which is discouraging. Next year’s movie is <em>Zootopia 2</em>. A third <em>Frozen </em>is coming in 2027. I loved <em>Zootopia </em>and <em>Frozen</em>, and that shit still sounds bleak to me. But before this pivot to sequels, Disney’s latest era has been full of bangers. Some call the movies that started with 2008’s <em>Bolt</em> the “revival” era, and it’s an apt description considering how excellent some of these movies have been. So we figured we’d rank them as we get ready to see what’s next with the arrival of <em>Moana 2</em>. We’ll probably update this list after we see the movie this week. For now, here’s the best and worst of Disney’s modern era. </p></div><div><p><em>Wish </em>is a hot mess. The 2023 film was meant to be a celebration of Disney’s 100th anniversary, and it instead ended up being one of the low points of the company’s animated canon. Yes, it’s gorgeously animated, employing a beautiful marriage of watercolor and 3D animation styles, and its music, penned by Julia Michaels and Benjamin Rice, is lovely, albeit undermined by awkward lyrics. But beyond that, it’s an incoherent, clichéd story that’s only notable for suggesting that numerous Disney characters and concepts all emerge from the same shared universe. It might end up giving <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/wish-kingdom-hearts-4-asha-magnifico-sora-1851050123&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/wish-kingdom-hearts-4-asha-magnifico-sora-1851050123"><em>Kingdom Hearts</em> some cool tools to work with</a></span> for its Disney crossovers, but it’s a movie that’s mostly better off forgotten. However, Chris Pine’s King Magnifico is in the running for hottest Disney villain. So it’s got that going for it.</p></div><div><p>2018’s <em>Ralph Breaks the Internet </em>still confounds me six years later. Modern Disney may be pretty synonymous with bleeding a property dry, but that tendency historically was not reflected by Walt Disney Animation Studios itself, which typically made one movie and then moved onto something else, leaving the other arms of Disney to do all the direct-to-video sequels and animated series. This sequel to 2012’s <em>Wreck-It Ralph</em>, however,<em> </em>was an arbiter for what would come, as Disney has become a sequel machine in the years since. However, <em>Ralph Breaks the Internet </em>is such an odd pivot from the video game tribute of its predecessor that it makes the entire “series” feel like an amorphous, malleable thing for Disney to play with. The heroes of <em>Ralph Breaks the Internet </em>enter a physical recreation of the world-wide web, including search engines, social media, online games, and what essentially equates to a digital theme park based on Disney properties. Sure, it’s got some great scenes, like when Vanellope meets the Disney Princesses, but the movie feels like an attempt to replicate <em>Inside Out</em>’s clever realization of concepts of thought, but without the thematic coherence to make it a compelling story. It’s a theme park experience of a movie, just throwing a variety of things at you to make you laugh and entertain you while narrative and meaning falls by the wayside, which is at least one thing that makes it consistent with the first film.</p></div><div><p>There are a few movies more forgotten in the current era of Disney than <em>Bolt</em>, and that’s despite it arguably being the movie that brought the company into a new age. Its premise of a superpowered spy dog actor having a fish-out-of-water experience as he breaks containment is a ton of fun, though today it feels a little dated by its early 2000s, Dreamworks-style smarminess. <em>Bolt </em>may not have had the staying power of the movies that would follow it, but we likely wouldn’t have had modern classics like <em>Tangled </em>and <em>Frozen </em>had it not been for <em>Bolt</em>’s story about letting go of a glamorous life for a simple one with the people you love.</p></div><div><p>While the <em>Winnie the Pooh </em>franchise is certainly not forgotten, it does feel like the 2011 film has been lost amidst the bigger hits of Disney’s past decade. The movie carries the distinction of being the last 2D animated film Disney has released in a theater, which is fitting, as it does feel like the last bastion of a different era. Its animation style is one thing, but it’s also distinct from most movies on this list for not adhering to the same tendency toward quippy dialogue and sassy heroes that typify modern Disney. It’s simple, and that makes it refreshing compared to most movies Disney puts out these days. </p></div><div><p>It’s a shame that <em>Raya and the Last Dragon </em>came out when it did, a year into the covid-19 pandemic, because it didn’t have the chance to be the ticket-driving cultural phenomenon that so many Disney movies get to be. The Kelly Marie Tran-led film has a lot going for it, including a story that feels timely and relevant as it examines warring tribes divided by distrust, eventually brought together by a younger generation who fights to reunite the people. It also has some of the best action scenes in Disney’s catalog as it draws inspiration from classic martial arts films. The film’s mythology is interesting in a vacuum but <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.theatlantic.com/culture/archive/2021/03/the-fantasy-southeast-asia-of-raya-and-the-last-dragon/618222/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/culture/archive/2021/03/the-fantasy-southeast-asia-of-raya-and-the-last-dragon/618222/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">was subject to criticism</a></span> when viewed through the lens of its Southeast Asian influence. <em>Raya and the Last Dragon </em>has its heart in the right place and is wonderfully acted and animated. It just maybe could have used another pass or two.</p></div><div><p>I was outnumbered on this one. In my opinion, <em>Wreck-It Ralph</em> is a cool idea with messy execution. Its early scenes, like a group therapy session showing the titular arcade game baddy working it out alongside video game icons like <em>Mario</em>’s Bowser, <em>Street FIghter</em>’s Zangief, and <em>Sonic</em>’s Eggman, feel like vignettes from a more focused movie. <em>Wreck-It Ralph </em>is a pretty good Disney movie but a half-hearted video game tribute. It starts strong with a bunch of really good cameos in the beginning, but loses its grip on its premise as the movie goes on. That being said, Ralph and Vanellope’s respective journeys to self-actualization in the face of pushback from society are still wonderful and heartfelt. The fact that the sequel loses the plot even more has retroactively soured me on <em>Wreck-It Ralph</em>, but others at <em>Kotaku</em> enjoy it more than I do, so it gets an upward nudge.</p></div><div><p>Like <em>Winnie the Pooh</em>, <em>The Princess and the Frog </em>feels like a relic of the past compared to other movies on this list. The last 2D animated film featuring a Disney Princess remains a sore spot for some in the studio’s canon because it has been wielded in debates about the company’s trajectory and the perceived marketability of films starring a Black woman protagonist. But on its own, <em>The Princess and the Frog </em>is a delightful, classic Disney affair that shuns the company’s usual musical theater sound in favor of a gospel-infused, soulful, jazzy soundtrack fitting for its 1920s New Orleans setting. <em>The Princess and the Frog </em>turns a fairytale standard into a period piece, following Princess Tiana’s rise from rags to riches. It’s one of Disney’s most interesting spins on the fairytales it usually draws from, and despite the bullshit that surrounded it, Tiana has had staying power alongside her Disney Princess contemporaries.</p></div><div><p><em>Strange World</em> is one of Disney’s most criminally underrated movies, full stop. The pulpy adventure film incorporates the Disney-standard generational trauma narrative to great effect as it follows three generations of the Clade family. Each has an idea of who their family is meant to be, and as the grandfather, father, and son of the family each reckon with their own beliefs, <em>Strange World </em>also delivers some of the most visually stunning animation Disney has ever put into (not enough) theaters. <em>Strange World </em>takes inspiration from adventure films like <em>Indiana Jones</em>, while also weaving in environmentalist themes propped up by a gorgeous alien universe. The titular world is made up of stunning, otherworldly vistas, lively characters both human and otherwise, and fascinating creatures that are, well, strange. And while its world is full of weirdness, its conflicts remain pretty human. The Clade family struggles to understand each other, and it takes reaching dangerous, unexplored places to consider the obvious. Tragically, Disney undermarketed the film, making it one of the biggest box office bombs in history. If you’ve got a Disney+ account, the movie is streaming, and it fucking rules. God, it deserved better.</p></div><div><p><em>Strange World</em> is one of Disney’s most criminally underrated movies, full stop.

God, it deserved better.</p></div><div><p>I fucking love <em>Encanto</em>. I do not like half of its soundtrack. Lin-Manuel Miranda and I have never quite gelled, and that doesn’t change when his music is attached to an otherwise excellent film. “We Don’t Talk About Bruno” is one of my karaoke go-tos, but otherwise I find most of <em>Encanto</em>’s music either plagued by Miranda’s usual grating sing-talky style or just dreadfully dull compared to that of most Disney movies. With that giant boulder pushed out of the way, <em>Encanto </em>is probably the best exploration of the generational trauma Disney has become synonymous with. It follows the Madrigal family, who have been gifted superhuman powers with which to aid their community. Those powers also come with the great weight of expectation from heroine Mirabel’s grandmother, who has been the matriarchal backbone of the family since she escaped a war-torn Colombia with her children. <em>Encanto </em>portrays a family fractured by expectations with a great deal of empathy for each generation. It’s cathartic to see younger generations finally find the courage to advocate for themselves after years of being held to an unreachable standard, and <em>Encanto </em>shows that, within reason, even the most fractured connections can be repaired.</p></div><div><p><em>Zootopia </em>is a complex onion of a movie to unpack because it has its heart in the right place but its mixed messages have made it harder to go back to in the years since it premiered in 2016. On the surface, <em>Zootopia </em>is a film about prejudice. Its titular metropolis is meant to be a paradise where anthropomorphic predators and prey live together in harmony. Rookie cop Judy Hopps moves to the city and discovers that idealized vision is not as it seems, and is forced to reckon with her own privilege after seeing how the social hierarchy affects predators like con-man fox Nick Wilde. The core allegorical premise is strong, and leads to some of the most emotionally affecting moments in recent Disney memory, it’s the pro-cop framing that feels harder to swallow eight years later. Sure, the movie examines the “bad apples” in the system, but feels largely uncritical of the institution it idolizes. It’s a Disney movie, so it’s not going to be particularly radical in its thinking. Its discussions of prejudice and privilege are apt and it does a good job of presenting those in a way that the average child (or adult, let’s be frank) might take something away from, but I’m interested to see if next year’s <em>Zootopia 2 </em>interrogates some of its core premises, though I’m not holding my breath. All that said, <em>Zootopia </em>has some of Disney’s sharpest writing, funniest comedic setpieces, and best performances from Ginnifer Goodwin and Jason Bateman as its two leads. Nick remains one of my favorite Disney characters. I’m a mark first and a hater second. I can’t wait to see these two in theaters again next year.</p></div><div><p>It’s been 10 years since <em>Big Hero 6</em>, and I’m surprised that it’s still the only Marvel property to get an official Disney animated adaptation since the company acquired the comic book maker back in 2009. <em>Big Hero 6 </em>is a loose adaptation of one of Marvel’s more obscure properties, and what sticks out to me all these years later is its exploration of grief, which it notably examines through the experience of a young boy. <em>Big Hero 6 </em>is a superhero origin story for protagonist Hiro Hamada, but more than that, it’s an extended, action-packed therapy session as he learns to let go of his anger and to embody the best parts of those he’s lost. This is all facilitated by Baymax, one of Disney’s most instantly likable characters in recent memory. The puffy, robotic doctor is a source of some of the film’s best gags, but is also the movie’s beating heart, embodying the transformative themes of <em>Big Hero 6</em> with each scene he’s in. I’d say the movie left me wanting more, but since it led to an animated sequel series and a Disney+ spin-off, we haven’t exactly been lacking for stuff set in the film’s universe, even if Disney hasn’t pushed for a proper sequel yet like it has with numerous other recent hits.</p></div><div><p>The final three on our list are widely considered to be the modern classics of Disney’s revival era, and I could easily see any of them in the top spot on any given day. But we can’t give them a three-way tie for first place (I mean, I don’t <em>think</em> we can), so I’ve gotta give <em>Moana </em>the third-place spot. Moana’s journey from a begrudging leader to a bold, trailblazing one takes her across oceans she’s only ever dreamed of, having been kept sequestered on her home island by her parents her whole life. But dreaming of something is one thing; reckoning with the reality of what you feel you’re capable of is much harder. <em>Moana </em>is a story of self-doubt and resilience, and knowing that the two feelings intermingle. Accomplishing anything means always finding your way back to the latter.</p><p>Thankfully, <em>Moana </em>leans less into Lin-Manuel Miranda’s more annoying bag of musical tricks than <em>Encanto </em>did, and Auliʻi Cravalho’s soaring vocals deliver empowering anthems that elevate the film’s most emotional beats. I’m curious to see if <em>Moana 2 </em>can live up to its predecessor with new songwriters at the helm.</p></div><div><p>2010’s <em>Tangled </em>was the blueprint for modern Disney before it reached near caricature status with <em>Wish</em>. The studio’s take on Rapunzel’s story is full of youthful joy, sharp wit, delightful earworms, and top-of-the-class animation. As a first attempt to bring the Disney Princess formula into 3D animation, Disney got it in one. Mandy Moore and Zachary Levi (damn, talk about a drop-off) have great chemistry as Rapunzel and rogueish criminal Eugene, and Broadway veteran Donna Murphy is brilliantly cast as Rapunzel’s scheming mother. Disney’s depiction of Rapunzel as a sheltered but exuberant young woman looking for a life beyond the monotonous one she’s suffered her whole life inspired multiple Disney heroines in the decade that followed. Even after all those imitators, however, Rapunzel still feels like one of the most genuine depictions of the archetype. Her story ends in the tower where it began, but she and Eugene return to the prison changed, both willing to sacrifice themselves for the other. Those selfless expressions are what ultimately free them from their old lives and allow them to find something new together.</p></div><div><p>If <em>Tangled </em>was Disney establishing that it could translate its previous successes into 3D, <em>Frozen </em>was a subversion of what everyone believed a Princess movie to be. The 2013 adaptation of “The Snow Queen” is built upon pulling the rug out from under you. For most of its run, it’s an endlessly charming story about two sisters who have been driven apart by fear, to the point that when they grow up, they barely know each other. One has been taught to fear the other, and the other has been made to fear herself. It puts them at a standstill, desiring closeness but unable to facilitate it. But this is a Disney movie, and as far as popular culture believes, Princess Anna doesn’t need her sister, she just needs to find a man and then her life will begin. First leaning into most people’s expectations of the Disney formula, <em>Frozen </em>then stabs viewers in the back, twists the knife, and kicks them down a stairwell. It’s both a pointed commentary on the blind spots in the company’s earlier work and a declaration of the studio’s ethos moving forward. That on its own makes <em>Frozen </em>one of the best films Disney has ever put in a theater, but the pitch-perfect casting of Idina Menzel and Kristen Bell helped shape two of the most recognizable pop culture characters of the past decade. The two leads give voice to some of the best songs in Disney’s catalog, tying together what remains the best example of a modern classic Disney has to its name. <em>Frozen II</em>’s exploration of Anna and Elsa builds beautifully on top of the original’s foundation, but even if it hadn’t, the story of two sisters reuniting without fear still exemplifies the best that Disney has to offer.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
