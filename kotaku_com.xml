              <p>Samsung and Amazon are running a heck of a promotion on the Galaxy S25 FE. The FE line of Galaxy phones are Samsung’s much more affordable entry point into it’s ecosystem of products. It’s great for someone looking for a phone upgrade, but who doesn’t want to spent thousands on a single device. And right now, it’s become even less expensive thanks to this Amazon limited time deal. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4018/">The Samsung Galaxy S25 FE is discounted down from $810 to just $650. The 20% savings equates to $160</a>. <strong>Not only that. This deal includes and Amazon gift card for $100 and you can upgrade from the base storage to double capacity for no extra charge.</strong></p>
<p>Gift cards are the best bonus you can receive in bundles like this. And this isn’t just like a Samsung gift card that needs to be spent on more Galaxy products. It’s Amazon. So you can put that toward basically anything you can imagine. Buy yourself some new flannels for Fall. Buy $100 worth of ladybug eggs. Truly, you can get anything.</p>

<h2>Big, Bright, and Smooth</h2>
<p>The Samsung Galaxy S25 FE has a wide 6.7-inch display with a refresh rate of up to 120Hz. It’s super lightweight and is built with a slim profile. Far less risk for folks who like to lay and bed, scrolling late into the night, who might&nbsp;<em>on occasion</em> drop their phone on their face.</p>
<p>The Galaxy smartphone is equipped with a 12MP selfie camera on the front capable of taking sharp photos and vivid videos. On the revers size, you’ll find three additional cameras — the 12MP ultra wide camera, the 8MP telephoto camera, and the 50MP main camera.</p>



<p>You can even make minor edits to your photos, resizing or erasing distracting elements in the shot. Night photography became a lot easier as you can now reduce grain and boost detail even in low light conditions. And you videos can algorithmically detect unwanted background noise from the the footage, isolating only the details you want to be heard.</p>
<p>Battery life is pretty solid. It’s working with a powerful 4,900mAh battery and supports Samsung’s Super Fast Charging 2.0 to bring it back up from zero to 100% quickly.</p>
<p>Choose between four stylish color options. You can pick either jet black, icy blue, navy, or white. All four choices are part of the limited time deal. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4018/">Upgrade any of them from 128GB to 256GB for no charge, save $160, plus get a free $100 Amazon gift card with your purchase.</a></p>
