In many ways its what everyone wanted and hoped for: A new version of the Switch that’s more powerful, sleeker, and supports all the old games. However, is this new console too...safe? Boring? This is what <em>Kotaku’s </em>staff debated shortly after the reveal, and here’s our lightly edited debate straight from Slack.</p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="195670" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="This Stylish Noir-Punk Side-Scroller Is Like Celeste With Guns" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="184" data-playlist="195670,193658,194644" data-current="195670"><div><p>This Stylish Noir-Punk Side-Scroller Is Like Celeste With Guns</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195670/195670_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195670/195670_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195670/195670_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195670/195670_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/21167.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><hr><p><strong>John Walker:</strong> God I’m SO BORED of the Switch 2.</p><p><strong>Zachary Zwiezen:</strong> Speaking of Switch 2... Is this the first time Nintendo has done the “Slap a 2 on it” thing? How Sony of them.</p><p><strong>Carolyn Petit:</strong> Yep.</p><p><strong>John:</strong> I think it’s very indicative of a company that’s suddenly got awfully unsure of itself.</p><p><strong> Zack:</strong> Oh exact opposite! </p><p><strong>Caro:</strong> Oh no, I think they know exactly what they’re doing. It’s not a “fun” name the way Super Nintendo Switch would be, but it’s the smart play.</p><p><strong>Kenneth Shepard</strong>: They want to avoid a WiiU situation IMO.</p><p><strong>Zack:</strong> YUP. In many ways lol.</p><figure id="" data-id="756b8cbf2e150e227e71ac8eb4ad194d" data-recommend-id="image://756b8cbf2e150e227e71ac8eb4ad194d" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Kotaku / Nintendo</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="756b8cbf2e150e227e71ac8eb4ad194d" data-recommend-id="image://756b8cbf2e150e227e71ac8eb4ad194d" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p><strong>John:</strong> See, I disagree. I get that they’re VERY sure this is a savvy marketing move, and they’re onto a good thing, and on and on and on.</p><p>But 15 years ago, they’d have called this something way better, and made it much weirder. Hence, unsure of themselves. They don’t think the “Nintendo” way of doing something would work.</p><p><strong>Caro:</strong> But everything was different 15 years ago. The Switch is still an outlier in the console space.</p><p><strong>Zack:</strong> Yeah. 15 years ago Nintendo was still selling a home console <em>and </em>a portable console.</p><p><strong>Ethan Gach:</strong> RIP Iwata</p><p><strong>Zack:</strong> I also think the <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/nintendo-switch-2-gallery-differences-comparison-joycon-1851740928&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/nintendo-switch-2-gallery-differences-comparison-joycon-1851740928">Switch 2</a></span> will still be weird in some ways we don’t know yet. The mouse stuff is weird! Cool, too</p><p><strong>Caro:</strong> I mean, doing something “weird” in this case would almost certainly be a failure from a business standpoint. The Wii, while “weird,” was also savvy business-wise, as it didn’t make sense for Nintendo to compete with Sony and MS at their own game.</p><p><strong>John:</strong> Yes, but it was weird.</p><p><strong>Zack:</strong> So was the virtual boy.</p><p><strong>John:</strong> Nintendo just announced an iteration of their current console and put a “2" on the name. That’s REALLY unlike them. It’s weird because it’s what everyone else does.</p><p><strong>Caro:</strong> Yes, but there is not an opportunity today for them to do something that is both “weird” and that would be that successful IMO.</p><p><strong>Zack:</strong> Also, I bet if you asked Nintendo designers they wouldn’t call any of that stuff weird. Just new ideas they were trying</p><p><strong>Caro:</strong> The SNES wasn’t weird. it was basically the equivalent for the time of the Switch 2.</p><p><strong>Zack:</strong> Gameboy Color was basically just Gameboy but color. Nintendo isn’t above iteration.</p><p><strong>John:</strong> No one expected a Wii, and at the time everyone said it was a mistake because it was so technologically weak. </p><p>When the Switch was announced, there was SO much discourse about how it couldn’t compete with the other consoles because it was so weak. </p><p>I think if Nintendo had done something totally new and weird and original, they could have still had a huge amount of success. And sure, make the Switch XL at the same time.</p><p><strong>Caro:</strong> Like what? What’s your amazing “weird” idea that could have done gangbusters today for Nintendo?</p><p><strong>Zack:</strong> And not break compatibility with hundreds of games.</p><p><strong>John:</strong> That’s the point! Only Nintendo could come up with it!</p><p><strong>Caro:</strong> [indifferent face emoji]</p><p> Yeah I mean, times change. I just don’t see that opportunity today. Maybe it will arise again in the future, but right now, this was the play.</p><p><strong>John:</strong> I think you’d have said the same post N64, post GC, etc. And post Wii!</p><p><strong>Caro:</strong> I would not.</p><p><strong>John:</strong> Clearly the Wii U was NOT the move, but I love that it WAS the move.</p><p><strong>Caro:</strong> I mean, post N64 maybe, Nintendo didn’t really get “weird” with consoles until the Wii.</p><p><strong>John:</strong> Here were my two AMAZING suggestions in my Switch 2 Disappointed piece:</p><blockquote data-type="BlockQuote"><p>“It’s a wearable piece of tech that uses holograms, or a bizarre twist on AR where the flagship Mario game uses our house furniture for platforms.”</p></blockquote><p><strong>Zack:</strong> I hate it.</p><p><strong>Caro:</strong> Right, that sounds like shit.</p><p><strong>Zack:</strong> Ask Apple how well AR is doing.</p><p><strong>Caro:</strong> There is no way that would have a high adoption rate. No way.</p><p><strong>John:</strong> THEY AREN’T REAL PITCHES!</p><p><strong>Zack:</strong> Well my reaction was very real. lol.</p><p><strong>Caro:</strong> I know but like, you’re just presuming that Nintendo can, under any and all marketplace circumstances, generate ideas for consoles that would be both groundbreaking and hugely successful. I don’t see a basis for that at all.</p><p><strong>Zack:</strong> Also, after the last decade of merging all their software development into ONE platform instead of two distinct divisions (portable/home) the Switch 2 was always going to be the play. </p><p><strong>John:</strong> If you said to me after the GameCube, “Come on then, think of something,” I wouldn’t have replied, “Um, a thing with a sensor bar and two sticks you wave around.” And if I had, you’d have said “hate it.”</p><p><strong>John: </strong>“Oh you mean like the Kinect? Yeah, GREAT idea.”</p><figure id="" data-id="1eed163dc8faa158032fa9927625f85e" data-recommend-id="image://1eed163dc8faa158032fa9927625f85e" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Kotaku / Nintendo</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="1eed163dc8faa158032fa9927625f85e" data-recommend-id="image://1eed163dc8faa158032fa9927625f85e" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p><strong>Zack:</strong> The thing is Nintendo still does weird shit in the Switch era. Its just stuff you buy <em>for </em>the Switch. Like Labo. Which is a better way to do it.</p><p><strong>Caro:</strong> Yeah. </p><p><strong>John: </strong><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/switch-2-joy-con-nintendo-new-features-1851735307&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/switch-2-joy-con-nintendo-new-features-1851735307">Everyone should read my brilliant article.</a></span></p><blockquote data-type="BlockQuote"><p>I still hold out hope that the Switch 2 will have some surprises. That little lens spotted in the Joy-Cons is something Nintendo will likely use in some really innovative ways, even if other developers never notice it’s there. I often think about one of the most wonderful aspects of the Switch—the all-too underrated Labo. Those cardboard packs, in conjunction with the peculiar controllers, that had you build working pianos, fishing rods for fishing games, and even a remote-controlled bug creature. It used the Joy-Con’s haptics to move around, and the infrared sensor as a tiny camera! That was bloody incredible! That was astoundingly imaginative, and I have high hopes that Nintendo has similarly inventive plans for using the new Joy-Cons’ tech. I like to imagine they’ll have pushed it all a little harder to third-party developers this time, so we can see some of the wonderful madness that appeared in the first few months of the Nintendo DS.</p></blockquote><p><strong>Zack:</strong> Yeah, that’s my point! Don’t need to make something weird, just include weird bits and build off that.</p><p><strong>John:</strong> You people would never have allowed the greatest gaming device of all time, the Nintendo DS.</p><p><strong>Zack:</strong> God I hated the DS. lol.</p><p><strong>John:</strong> “Two screens, only one is a touch screen, and they’re an inch apart? And it’s a clamshell? Fuck off you British idiot.”</p><p><strong>Ethan:</strong> The weird bits are included in 5 games that aren’t that good and everyone moves on.</p><p><strong>Zack:</strong> We should post this chat, lightly edited as a VG chat for tomw morning/later today.</p><p> .<br></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Now it’s delving into piracy with <em>Like a Dragon: Pirate Yakuza in Hawaii</em>. I recently got to spend two hours with the game, due out next month, and, I came away expecting Ryu Ga Gotoku Studio to once again nail new ideas while maintaining the series’ old familiar draws.</p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="196578" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="Total Recall: Why Yakuza Is So Much More Than A Japanese GTA" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="387" data-playlist="196578,194088,195896" data-current="196578"><div><p>Total Recall: Why Yakuza Is So Much More Than A Japanese GTA</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196578/196578_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196578/196578_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196578/196578_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196578/196578_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/22135.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p><em>Pirate Yakuza </em>puts the focus entirely on fan-favorite comic relief rival Goro Majima for the first time in the series’ 20-year history. Majima has been a supporting character and playable hero a few times over the years, but <em>Pirate Yakuza </em>is the first time he’s been the lone star of the show. He’s a good lead for a game that takes the series in one of its more outlandish directions yet, as he’s often facilitated comic breaks with fervor and gusto. If there’s one character that commits to the bit, it’s him, and that includes becoming a pirate captain in modern-day Hawaii.</p><p><em>Pirate Yakuza</em>’s story takes place six months after the events of <em>Like a Dragon: Infinite Wealth</em>, and somehow Majima’s lost all memory of his life as a crime boss and club manager. <em>Pirate Yakuza </em>doesn’t use this as a complete break from previous games, as recovering his old memories is a core part of his story, but it does mean that he’s taking on a new crew on the open seas off Hawaii’s shores. Majima is at the center of a conflict between the pirates he works alongside and the yakuza he was once a part of.</p><p>The tension between those two forces means <em>Pirate Yakuza </em>is constantly shifting between traditional <em>Yakuza </em>scraps and silliness and, as the name suggests, pirate ship battles. As far as hand-to-hand combat goes, <em>Pirate Yakuza </em>delivers some of the fastest-paced fighting the series has had, to the point that it feels like it borders on a character action game along the lines of <em>Devil May Cry</em>. <em>Like a Dragon Gaiden</em> <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/like-a-dragon-gaiden-preview-agent-style-yakuza-rgg-1850759282?rev=1736969234480&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/like-a-dragon-gaiden-preview-agent-style-yakuza-rgg-1850759282?rev=1736969234480">experimented with spy gadgetry</a></span> to give its combat a distinct feel, and <em>Pirate Yakuza </em>is riffing on its own motif by giving Majima a pair of cutlasses. The game feels snappy, stylish, and occasionally pretty tough. Swapping Majima between his harder-hitting pirate persona and the nimble yakuza one can make the difference between getting clobbered and overcoming a gang of criminals. I gravitated toward the knife-wielding yakuza style for one-on-one fights and swapped to the pirate one for wider slashes when taking on big groups. I was surprised by the difficulty of a few fights, such as one against a runaway prisoner I met on the beaches of Hawaii who cold-cocked me as I was still learning all the tricks I had at my disposal. Most of my memories of <em>Yakuza 0</em>’s beat-em-up combat are of it being tedious and repetitive, so coming into <em>Pirate Yakuza </em>and finding something that felt involved and dynamic was a welcome sign.</p><p><em>Pirate Yakuza</em>’s riffs on old <em>Yakuza </em>ideas are where it shines the most. Even though Majima is sailing the seven seas this time, I still found the grounded moments traveling around cities on land to be just as memorable as duking it out on a pirate ship. Between silly mini-games and squaring up against any crook who would approach me, I rode around on a scooter until I stopped at a small cafe where employees were trying to attract customers with a small performance. Even as the series constantly pushes against the boundaries of what people think it is, those small human interactions remain the beating heart of <em>Yakuza</em>.</p><p>The actual pirate ship battles are the part I’m not quite sold on just yet, but I could see them getting more complex beyond the early sections of the game I played. Sailing to different islands on a slow-moving ship with weather hazards felt novel, but I could imagine it getting tedious down the line. Ship battles, meanwhile, feel complex in the menus beforehand, but in practice got rather monotonous as I would position my ship to fire upon incoming vessels, let out some cannonballs, then turn around and do the same thing from the other side. The depth comes from the preparation, which includes assigning crewmates with different specialties to weapon-manning and other tasks to bolster your ship’s effectiveness in battle. Building your ship’s arsenal and managing your crew were the most interesting part of ship battles in my time with the early game, and I’m curious to see just how expansive these options are and if the game can spice these fights up as it goes on.</p><p>Every time I pick up a <em>Yakuza </em>game, I’m always surprised to see just how much RGG can bend what I think these games are without quite breaking them. The series has been characterized as grounded despite constantly escalating to new heights, and what I’ve played of <em>Pirate Yakuza </em>feels like a natural yet goofy extension built off a stable foundation. We’ll see if Majima’s seafaring detour pays off when the game launches on February 21, but even if it doesn’t, I’m more curious than ever about how far RGG is willing to take its heroes as it keeps pushing the boundaries of what it means to be a <em>Yakuza </em>game.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Nintendo confirmed the existence of the device last year, and it’s been a drip feed of news from leakers ever since. Now that the Switch 2 officially exists and we can put a face and name to the concept of the Switch successor, fans can finally relax after clinging to the company’s socials for all this time.</p><figure id="" data-id="944751a08399c18c6f157cf56d76dfe6" data-recommend-id="image://944751a08399c18c6f157cf56d76dfe6" data-format="png" data-width="1231" data-height="219" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A YouTube comment that reads &quot;Never has there been so much 'ok fine, here's an announcement' energy.&quot;" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A YouTube comment that reads &quot;Never has there been so much 'ok fine, here's an announcement' energy.&quot;" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->YouTube / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="944751a08399c18c6f157cf56d76dfe6" data-recommend-id="image://944751a08399c18c6f157cf56d76dfe6" data-format="png" data-width="1231" data-height="219" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A YouTube comment that reads &quot;Never has there been so much 'ok fine, here's an announcement' energy.&quot;" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><h2 id="h87820"><a id=""></a><em><strong>Mario Kart (9?)</strong></em></h2><p>We still don’t know much about the Nintendo Switch 2, and the only game the company showed for the device was a new <em>Mario Kart</em>. No title was given, but the brief glimpse we saw of the game in action showed a more cartoonish art style than that of <em>MK8 </em>and teased what seems to be a 24-player mode. Fans seem stoked about it, and hot on the subtly revamped character designs.</p><h2 id="h87821"><a id=""></a><strong>Avoiding the Wii U mistake</strong></h2><p>One thing several people have noted is that Nintendo went out of its way to make it clear that the Nintendo Switch 2 is a new console. The Wii U had plenty of problems, but one of the biggest was the mistaken perception, based on its branding, that it could be a peripheral for the original Wii. Slapping a 2 on the name makes it clear that this is the next iteration of the thing you already love. Say what you want about PlayStation’s naming convention not being that flashy, but you know that a PlayStation 5 is the next major console from Sony. The Switch 2 name is straightforward, and that is the best decision Nintendo could have made in moving to the next system.</p><h2 id="h87822"><a id=""></a><strong>Some healthy skepticism and questions</strong></h2><p>The reveal trailer finally removed any uncertainty about the existence of the Switch 2, but it was light on some larger details. Right now, it seems to be mostly a bigger, beefier Switch with a few extra bells and whistles. That’s pretty uncharacteristic of Nintendo, which has typically introduced some major innovation in every generational leap. So there are a lot of unanswered questions still floating around as we move toward launch. Is the bigger screen and more powerful hardware the main hook? Will Nintendo release more Joy-Cons than the sleek ones it shows in the reveal trailer? There’s still a lot we don’t know about the Switch 2.</p><h2 id="h87823"><a id=""></a><strong>The mouse and keyboard girlies are eating</strong></h2><p>There have been rumors that the Switch 2’s Joy-Cons would double as mice. This could be huge for strategy games like <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/switch-2-pc-mouse-joycon-civilization-7-1851741008&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/switch-2-pc-mouse-joycon-civilization-7-1851741008"><em>Civilization 7</em></a></span> that have historically been cumbersome to play with a controller. Nintendo didn’t confirm it in the trailer, but there’s a shot of the Joy-Cons seemingly being used like a mouse that has people excited for the possibilities.</p><h2 id="h87824"><a id=""></a><strong>A collection of good jokes</strong></h2><figure id="" data-id="8062c738e3627ca2c9067268046ca25c" data-recommend-id="image://8062c738e3627ca2c9067268046ca25c" data-format="png" data-width="738" data-height="487" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A Bluesky post reads &quot;bold choice to show the new joycons literally drifting.&quot;" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A Bluesky post reads &quot;bold choice to show the new joycons literally drifting.&quot;" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Bluesky / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="8062c738e3627ca2c9067268046ca25c" data-recommend-id="image://8062c738e3627ca2c9067268046ca25c" data-format="png" data-width="738" data-height="487" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A Bluesky post reads &quot;bold choice to show the new joycons literally drifting.&quot;" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><figure id="" data-id="f6e3cb78e6baeef9d12201b32d34ebf5" data-recommend-id="image://f6e3cb78e6baeef9d12201b32d34ebf5" data-format="png" data-width="749" data-height="231" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A Bluesky post reads &quot;I note that nothing in the Switch 2 reveal trailer contradicts my theory that the Switch 2 will cost 10 million dollars and be the size of a car.&quot;" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A Bluesky post reads &quot;I note that nothing in the Switch 2 reveal trailer contradicts my theory that the Switch 2 will cost 10 million dollars and be the size of a car.&quot;" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Bluesky / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="f6e3cb78e6baeef9d12201b32d34ebf5" data-recommend-id="image://f6e3cb78e6baeef9d12201b32d34ebf5" data-format="png" data-width="749" data-height="231" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A Bluesky post reads &quot;I note that nothing in the Switch 2 reveal trailer contradicts my theory that the Switch 2 will cost 10 million dollars and be the size of a car.&quot;" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
