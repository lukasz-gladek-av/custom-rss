Between the battle system and overworld, he felt like he was almost making two games instead of one. Plus, he didn’t really have a story for the RPG and was worried battles felt monotonous compared to the strategizing of an<em> Into the Breach</em> or <em>Slay the Spire</em>. “I wanted to get it to a point where combat felt strategic and puzzly,” Robinson-Yu wrote. “But I got the sense that battles just felt like an annoying obstacle to players interested in exploring.”</p><p>The developer said that <em>A Short Hike</em>, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/the-bittersweet-journey-of-a-short-hike-1841525700&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/the-bittersweet-journey-of-a-short-hike-1841525700">a chill, pretty, and occasionally bittersweet journey</a></span>, was unexpectedly lucrative for him, so he hasn’t been pinched for time. But a <em>Paper Mario</em>-like adventure wasn’t necessarily feeling like a fit for the type of games he’s interested in making. “I thought there was some dissonance between the cute and grounded world I was trying to make and the requirement for an RPG story to justify lots of fights and violence,” he wrote. “I’m not against video game violence, but it always felt at odds with the kinds of feelings I wanted to express at the time.”</p><p>Outside of a <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://adamgryu.itch.io/pumpkin-carver&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://adamgryu.itch.io/pumpkin-carver" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Pumpkin Carving MMO</a></span>, Robinson-Yu hasn’t released anything since 2019, but he’s working on a bunch of things that might come out eventually, including an “action adventure game,” a different micro-RPG using Claymation, and an online platforming roguelike. Hopefully, one of those makes it to release, or at the very least we get a demos for them as well.</p><p>. </p></div></div><br/><br/>https://kotaku.com/paper-mario-untiled-rpg-short-hike-free-demo-1851785213]]></content:encoded>

The other is one of the rewards for completing the raid quest “The House Loses,” which can be done by yourself in Story Mode.</p><figure id="" data-id="e7b2e583032c5b92739099d3c4cde6c4" data-recommend-id="image://e7b2e583032c5b92739099d3c4cde6c4" data-format="jpg" data-width="1013" data-height="562" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Characters stand in an armor workshop." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Characters stand in an armor workshop." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Blizzard / Thomas Wilde / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="e7b2e583032c5b92739099d3c4cde6c4" data-recommend-id="image://e7b2e583032c5b92739099d3c4cde6c4" data-format="jpg" data-width="1013" data-height="562" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Characters stand in an armor workshop." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>An ERU Crest can be used in your crafting materials to upgrade your weapon to a maximum of item level 658.

These can be purchased from Syenite for 60 Gilded Crests, and the matching Augmentation Matrix goes for another 30. With these, you can take your weapon all the way up to a maximum of 681 item level.

The easiest way for a casual player to get Gilded Crests is to run Tier 11 bountiful delves. Make sure to get and use a Delver’s Bounty for one of them. You should walk away with 30-50 Gilded Crests in a week as long as you don’t run out of lives.</p><p>Alternatively, if you’ve got a friend or an easily bribed acquaintance who’s into mythic dungeons or raids, they’ve probably got more Gilded Crests at this point than they know what to do with. You can file a recrafting order for them in Dornegal so they can use their surplus Crests to enhance your weapon.</p><p>When you write it all down, the process of acquiring a high-quality crafted weapon in <em>The War Within </em>looks complicated, but it’s not that bad once you’ve done it for yourself. If you’re a casual<em> WoW </em>player looking for a power boost, however, you can’t do much better than making and gradually upgrading your own custom equipment.</p><hr><p><br>Season two of <em>World of Warcraft: The War Within </em>is currently live as of June, 2025.  </p></div></div><br/><br/>https://kotaku.com/world-of-warcraft-wow-war-within-11-1-weapon-crafting-1851785210]]></content:encoded>

In their primes, Cena was the superhero company man who always won regardless of the odds stacked against him or whether fans actually wanted him to, and, by contrast, Punk was the rebellious, tattoo-covered indie darling whose real talk and wrestling chops changed the industry forever.</p><p>The yin and yang dynamic created an unparalleled chemistry that continues to this day and will be on display in the ring for perhaps one final time.</p><p>As we inch closer to their clash at Night of Champions, airing on Peacock at 12 PM ET this Saturday (their first one-on-one bout in over 10 years), we’re looking back at the Tommy guns, pipebombs, and five-star matches that have made John Cena and CM Punk’s rivalry so magical.</p></div></div><div><p>John Cena and CM Punk’s story didn’t begin in the ring. It started at WrestleMania 22 in Chicago. </p><p>Cena was set to defend his WWE Championship against Triple H. Before Big Match John’s music hit, the ramp lifted and a 1940s-style gangster car drove to the ring. Standing on its right rocker panel was a man outfitted in a blue suit and gray fedora, holding a Tommy gun.</p><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/SquaredCircle/comments/1jspe5h/before_this_coming_wrestlemania_the_closest_cm/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/SquaredCircle/comments/1jspe5h/before_this_coming_wrestlemania_the_closest_cm/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The man</a></span> was CM Punk.</p><p>Dressing in a Halloween costume to be a prop for the face of the company isn’t exactly a glamorous job. But hey, at least Punk did technically get his WrestleMania main event moment out of it.</p><p>The best part of Cena’s cartoonish entrance is the fact that the song the gangsters drove out to was once in a famous cartoon. David Farnon’s “Cape Crusader” played in the episode of SpongeBob that introduced us to <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-KPJ5KjdBZk&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-KPJ5KjdBZk" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy</a></span>. It hypes up their return to crime-fighting to serve as Bikini Bottom’s geriatric superheroes.</p><p>Do with that information what you will.</p></div><div><p>The first time Cena and Punk locked horns was on SmackDown’s 10th anniversary show. An 8-man tag match featured the duo on opposing teams, along with a bunch of no-names – ya know, guys like Shawn Michaels, Triple H, The Undertaker, Randy Orton, and Cody Rhodes. </p><p>Later that year, the Cenation Leader and future Best In The World finally met in the squared circle 1-on-1. At the peak of his mightiest powers, Super Cena quickly disposed of his opponent on two separate occasions, with the second bout lasting a whopping one minute and 41 seconds.</p><p>There’s not a whole lot to write home about their earliest encounters. That said, Cena’s smooth reversal of the GTS into an STF was born and went on to become a signature sequence for the pair.</p></div><div><p>The debut of the Nexus will forever be burned into the brains of fans old enough to remember watching it live. </p><p>Midway through Raw’s main event, every member of NXT Season 1 appeared and surrounded the ring. They stalked their prey, standing on the apron Shield-style, and descended on John Cena like a bunch of clickers who located an infected.</p><p>He wasn’t the group’s only target. Daniel Bryan choked out ring announcer Justin Roberts with his own tie. Heath Slater and Justin Gabriel mauled commentator Jerry “The King” Lawler. Wade Barrett ripped the canvas padding and foam cover off the ring mat to expose its wood planks.</p><p>They made ruining wrestling cool a decade-and-a-half before Cena did.</p><p>A forgotten figure in the melee? CM Punk, who fought John Boy prior to the interference. Needless to say, their match was completely overshadowed by the chaotic spectacle.&nbsp;</p></div><div><p>In 2011, CM Punk posted an impressive 6-1 singles record against John Cena, with most of the damage (including four straight victories) coming before their Money in the Bank classic.</p><p>Sure, shenanigans were involved, but against Cena, a win is a win.</p><p>Their January 17 match on Raw in particular exhibited signs of a special chemistry. A frosted-tipped Punk had just formed the New Nexus (remember them?), while Cena was on his never-lose shit.</p><p>Both stars accentuated each other’s strengths, with the Chicago native locking in an unusual leg choke hold and Cena catching Punk in mid-air off a top-rope, springboard crossbody attempt to the outside.</p><p>The back-and-forth affair concluded when Punk weaseled his way to a DQ win, thanks to interference from former New Nexus member (and current <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.instagram.com/reel/DIcs49yPG2G/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.instagram.com/reel/DIcs49yPG2G/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Cirque du Soleil star</a></span>) Mason Ryan.</p><p>It’s remarkable to think that the landscape-shifting Cena-Punk summer rivalry was just a few months down the road.</p></div><div><p>For years, Mr. Hustle, Loyalty, and Respect ruled the WWE kingdom. He was perpetually in the title picture, either holding the world championship or chasing it. He never, ever lost cleanly. He was the Thanos of sports entertainment: inevitable.</p><p>Then, there was Punk. A former indie wrestler, he had quietly built a formidable resume with multiple title wins and a series of show-stealing feuds (his rivalry with Jeff Hardy fed families). By mid-2011, his WWE contract was coming to an end, making it the perfect time to air out his grievances with the company. And he did. Loudly.</p><p>On a June episode of Raw, the Second City Saint casually dropped the best promo of the 21st Century. Punk’s pipebomb blurred the lines between truth and fiction with surgical precision.</p><p>He seamlessly played the role of disgruntled employee, claiming he wasn’t afforded the opportunities he deserved. Relatable. Punk hated the idea that John Cena was considered the best when, really, <em>he</em> was the best wrestler in the world. No arguments there.</p><p>It felt like Punk was speaking for the WWE Universe, fed up with the status quo. He vowed to defeat Cena for the WWE Championship in his hometown of Chicago at Money in the Bank and ride off into the sunset.</p><p>The Voice of the Voiceless would make good on his promise, and then some. He beat Cena at MITB to win the title, left, returned with a new theme song, and knocked off Cena again at SummerSlam, all while injecting a heavy dose of meta-realism into a stale product and becoming the greatest anti-hero since Steve Austin.</p><p>Punk was the undisputed star of the summer, but his impact was made possible by the sovereignty of Cena, who, as it turns out, was “evitable” after all.&nbsp;</p></div><div><p>The next chapter of the John Cena-CM Punk saga took place the following summer. </p><p>Punk was the reigning WWE champion, the brass ring he spent years reaching for finally in his possession. Cena held the Money in the Bank briefcase and decided to cash in “honorably,” announcing his challenge on the special “Raw 1,000” episode ahead of time.</p><p>Mayhem ensued.</p><p>As the duo slugged it out, the Big Show interfered and attacked Cena, triggering a disqualification. The DQ finish meant not only that Punk retained, but that Big Match John was the first man to unsuccessfully cash in.</p><p>After the bell rang, a conflicted Punk turned his back to Show as he continued to dismantle the Cenation Leader. The Rock’s music hit, and he sprinted to the ring to make the save. As Rock was about to nail Show with the People’s Elbow, Punk delivered an unexpected clothesline to The Great One, followed up by a devastating GTS.</p><p>Punk’s heel turn stunned the WWE Universe, and it proved that he would stop at nothing to defend his title—even if it meant compromising his morals. Cena, as we know, was built different, and their contrasting principles would deepen their rivalry even more.</p></div><div><p>If you’re jonesing to watch a stellar wrestling match, revisit John Cena and CM Punk’s bout at Night of Champions in Boston.</p><p>A villainous Punk was going on 302 consecutive days as champ, and Cena looked to avenge his failed MITB cash-in attempt a few months prior. The stage was set for another legendary battle, and the rivals put on an absolute clinic.</p><p>Counter after counter, reversal after reversal, neither was able to gain the upper hand. So, they reached DEEP into their arsenals. Punk unleashed a flurry of submission holds, including a crossface and a muta lock. He even attempted a moonsault and landed a Rock Bottom! Cena hit a suicide dive to the outside and a massive top-rope leg drop.</p><p>In the best way possible, the match felt like it was never going to end. Both men kicked out of each other’s finisher…twice. Finally, Cena nailed a German Suplex from the second rope and bridged for a cover and pinfall.</p><p>It appeared that Cena got the victory; however, the ref handed Punk the title since both of their shoulders were down, signaling a draw.</p><p>The storytelling was perfect. The psychology was perfect. The ending was perfect. Punk and Cena showed why no one could touch them in the ring.</p></div><div><p>John Cena and CM Punk set the bar so high for their matches that each time they competed, you’d think it was their last. Like it was game 7, like their lives were on the line. </p><p>Little did they know, their bout on a February episode of Raw would indeed be their swan song—for the next 12 years, at least.</p><p>The contest determined who would go on to face The Rock in the main event of WrestleMania 29: Cena, the Royal Rumble winner, or Punk, who just lost his title.</p><p>The two dynamos followed the blueprint they created at Night of Champions for pulling off a five-star level match to perfection.</p><p>The Straight Edge Superstar reversed each of Cena’s five moves of doom, while John countered Punk’s various submission holds and GTS attempts. Cena landed a sit-down powerbomb, and Punk executed a piledriver (a legitimately banned move in the WWE).</p><p>In the end, it was a surprising hurricanrana and Attitude Adjustment combination that gave Cena the win.</p><p>The long-time rivals delivered another classic because, well, don’t they always?</p></div><div><p>Watching John Cena and CM Punk share the ring at the Royal Rumble felt like a dream. Witnessing them hug and then fight in the Elimination Chamber was like seeing a band reunite to perform the hits after decades apart.</p><p>Sure, Cena has less hair, Punk’s got a bit of grey in his beard, and they don’t move quite as well as they used to, but the magic remained. In the chamber, Cena’s reversal of the GTS into an STF harkened back to their first one-on-one match on that 2009 episode of Raw.</p><p>Ultimately, the West Newbury native capitalized on a wicked curb stomp from Seth Rollins to Punk on the steel, locking him in the STF and causing him to lose consciousness to pick up the W.</p><p>Minutes later, the most do-gooding superhero in WWE history did the unthinkable. He turned heel, laying the groundwork for him and Punk to potentially clash again.</p></div><div><p>How can John Cena and CM Punk top what they’ve done in the past? They couldn’t possibly have any more cards to play, right? Wrong. Lo and behold, the “never-seen,” 17-time champ pulled the ultimate Uno-reversal out of his jort pockets in the form of a reverse pipebomb. </p><p>Last week, Cena stole his long-time adversary’s material—the material that elevated Punk to superstardom—and co-opted it to troll him. Without John, the Voice of the Voiceless would have never gotten his stage to speak, reigned as WWE Champion for 434 days straight, or gone off to UFC and AEW.</p><p>When all is said and done, John Cena will always be CM Punk’s daddy.</p><p>With the former Cenation Leader a heel and the Best in the World a babyface (another reversal), this Saturday, the forever foes will meet in the ring at Night of Champions—the same PLE where they wrestled their best match 13 years ago.</p><p>Soon, we’ll find out if they can rise to the occasion once more.&nbsp;</p></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://kotaku.com/john-cena-cm-punk-rivalry-feud-timeline-1851785211]]></content:encoded>

We’ll see how the GameCube emulation holds up for it, but if <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/switch-2-online-gamecube-games-wind-waker-fzero-classic-1851774234&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/switch-2-online-gamecube-games-wind-waker-fzero-classic-1851774234">it’s anything like <em>The Legend of Zelda: Wind Waker</em></a></span>, <em>Mario Strikers</em> should also look and run better on the Switch 2 even though it’s not getting the full-blown remaster treatment. It’s also another reason to pick up Nintendo’s modern GameCube controller replica that released alongside the new console. </p><p>That accessory will come in handy once<em> Smash Bros. Melee </em>arrives. I mean, Nintendo has to be getting ready to bring that over too, right? (<em>Oh, Ethan...—Anti-Naivety Ed</em>) While <em>Super Mario Strikers</em> isn’t my personal pick for the fourth GameCube game to join the Switch 2's retro library, there are plenty of excellent games we should be getting now that Nintendo has a solution for porting them beyond individual remasters. That includes a bunch of other sports spin-offs. <em>Mario Superstar Baseball </em>when? And don’t forget about<em> Dance Dance Revolution: Mario Mix</em>. Maybe Nintendo will ship a new dance pad just in time for the holidays. </p><p>.</p></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://kotaku.com/switch-2-mario-strikers-gamecube-smash-bros-melee-1851785199]]></content:encoded>

Here’s how to unlock all the <em>Street Fighter 6</em> armor and skins in <em>Monster Hunter Wilds</em>:</p><ul data-type="List" data-style="Bullet"><li><strong>Akuma Armor</strong>: This full hunter armor set is unlocked for forging by completing the Ultimate Strength Side Mission. It requires five SF6 Tickets, three Ajarakan Scale+, and one Ajarakan Jewel+ to forge</li><li><strong>Blanka-Chan Palico Armor:</strong> This full armor set for your Palico is also unlocked by completing the Ultimate Strength Side Mission. It requires two SF6 Tickets and two Ajarakan Scale+ to forge</li><li><strong>Cammy Handler Outfit:</strong> A skin for Alma that can be purchased for $5.99</li><li><strong>Chun-Li Handler Outfit:</strong> A skin for Alma that can be purchased for $5.99</li></ul><p>There are also some miscellaneous things you can snag too, such as a few gestures and a pendant. I can confirm that the gestures do inflict damage when they hit a monster, but it’s a pretty negligible amount. They also all require real money to unlock. Here are the remaining items and how much they cost:</p><ul data-type="List" data-style="Bullet"><li><strong>SF6 Hadoken Gesture:</strong> $3.99</li><li><strong>SF6 Shoryuken Gesture:</strong> $3.99</li><li><strong>SF6 Tatsumaki Senpu-Kyaku Gesture:</strong> $3.99</li><li><strong>Street Fighter 6 Sticker Set:</strong> $1.99</li><li><strong>Blanka-Chan Doll Pendant:</strong> $1.49</li></ul><h2 id="h340187"><a id=""></a>How to Get SF6 Tickets</h2><figure id="" data-id="c4b0fbb1e6e5e500fcd30e94dcebd5a2" data-recommend-id="image://c4b0fbb1e6e5e500fcd30e94dcebd5a2" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The rewards screen for the Demonic Strength quest, highlighting the SF6 Ticket material." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="The rewards screen for the Demonic Strength quest, highlighting the SF6 Ticket material." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Capcom / Samuel Moreno / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="c4b0fbb1e6e5e500fcd30e94dcebd5a2" data-recommend-id="image://c4b0fbb1e6e5e500fcd30e94dcebd5a2" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The rewards screen for the Demonic Strength quest, highlighting the SF6 Ticket material." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Just like with the Blossomdance Festival event and the <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/monster-hunter-wilds-mh-mon-hun-arch-tempered-rey-dau-1851782762&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/monster-hunter-wilds-mh-mon-hun-arch-tempered-rey-dau-1851782762">Arch-Tempered Rey Dau</a></span> equipment, the new forgeable items from this collaboration require a new material. Appropriately, that material is called <em>SF6 </em>Ticket. <strong>The only way to get </strong><em><strong>SF6 </strong></em><strong>Tickets are as rewards from the Demonic Strength and True Strength Arena Quests.</strong> Both of these are unlocked as you complete the Ultimate Strength side mission in the Oilwell Basin. Akuma will give you the first of these after you find him in the small cave near the Area 14 Mining Cave Tent pop-up camp. You’ll unlock True Strength after finishing the side mission.</p><p>These Arena Quests are pretty similar. You’ll face off against a Tempered Ajarakan while wearing Akuma armor. Demonic Strength is a solo run against a three-star Ajarakan, while True Strength allows for two hunters to take on a five-star Ajarakan. Farming the easier Demonic Strength quest is the best way to get <em>SF6 </em>Tickets fast. I was able to breeze through it with A-rank speed and almost solely using the Akuma armor attacks.</p><p><strong>You need ten total <em>SF6 </em>Tickets to forge all the related items.</strong> The Akuma armor set requires five; the Blanka-Chan palico armor set requires two; and the new Mighty Charm III requires three. Keep in mind that any other required materials will have to be gathered from other hunts.</p><h2 id="h340188"><a id=""></a>How to play as Akuma</h2><figure id="" data-id="4831320cf7ef266a1ca21940d7c10052" data-recommend-id="image://4831320cf7ef266a1ca21940d7c10052" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The new Akuma tab in the Basic Controls menu lists out the benefits of wearing his full armor set." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="The new Akuma tab in the Basic Controls menu lists out the benefits of wearing his full armor set." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Capcom / Samuel Moreno / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="4831320cf7ef266a1ca21940d7c10052" data-recommend-id="image://4831320cf7ef266a1ca21940d7c10052" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The new Akuma tab in the Basic Controls menu lists out the benefits of wearing his full armor set." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Breaking the head of a <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/monster-hunter-wilds-mh-defeat-mizutsune-bubbles-temper-1851781466&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/monster-hunter-wilds-mh-defeat-mizutsune-bubbles-temper-1851781466">Mizutsune</a></span> with an uppercut is a satisfying experience, and you can live that dream too by wearing the Akuma armor. However, this unique mechanic sadly isn’t without some key downsides. You’ll be given the following three Item Bar options when you wear the Akuma armor set or use the Layered Armor version:</p><ul data-type="List" data-style="Bullet"><li><strong>Assisted Combo: Akuma</strong>: Leaving your Item Bar centered over this option is how you gain access to most of the fighter’s moves. You always have to press Square/X to begin Assisted Combo 1, but you can then switch over to Triangle/Y or Circle/B for Assisted Combos 2 and 3. Pressing X/A during a combo will change your roll into an Ashura Senku teleport</li><li><strong>Gou Hadoken</strong>: Equipping this provides you with a special Hadoken projectile that functions like Slinger ammo</li><li><strong>Drive Impact</strong>: This action only works if the green six-bar Drive Gauge above the Item Bar is full. Landing a Drive Impact against a monster’s wound will destroy it with a Shun Goku Satsu. Drive Impact can also gain <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/monster-hunter-wilds-offset-attack-monster-weapons-1851775743&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/monster-hunter-wilds-offset-attack-monster-weapons-1851775743">Offset Attack</a></span> priorities if the full Akuma armor is equipped</li></ul><p>Additionally, Akuma armor allows the use of the Gou Shoryuken gesture that’s awarded after completing the Ultimate Strength side mission. This gesture inflicts a bit more damage than the paid ones, but more importantly, it enhances into an OD Gou Shoryuken when performed after a combo.</p><p>I can’t deny that this sounds awkward and overly complicated. The trick is to make use of the various button shortcuts. Although assigning these actions to a Radial Menu is great for quicker access, relying on the following button shortcuts will allow you to fight with only the Assisted Combo option equipped:</p><ul data-type="List" data-style="Bullet"><li><strong>Drive Impact Shortcut:</strong> Activated with a Focus Strike input (L2+R1/LT+RB) during an Assisted Combo</li><li><strong>Raging Demon Shortcut:</strong> An offshoot of his Drive Impact that you can cancel animations into and begins with an Ashura Senku teleport. Activated by <em>very quickly</em> pressing Square, Square, Triangle+Circle or X, X, Y+B</li><li><strong>OD Gou Shoryuken:</strong> Activated during or after combos by inputting right, down, right, and then any of the attack buttons. Those directional inputs have to be done with the stick and not a Directional pad.</li></ul><p>Many of Akuma’s attacks are short-range with limited movement. His iconic hurricane kick is ideal for repositioning, which is performed by pressing Circle/B three times for a full Assisted Combo 3 string. <strong>Akuma’s best combo connects the entire strings from all three of his Assisted Combos.</strong> That means pressing Square/X three times, Triangle/Y three times, and then Circle/B three times. Throwing out an OD Gou Shoryuken is a nice way to round it out. This should be the go-to when monsters are knocked down, since they won’t be able to interrupt you.</p><p>All of the above covers Akuma’s actions, but it means nothing without a good base. All of his techniques scale with your primary weapon’s raw damage and affinity. Equipping something with significant base damage will result in stronger Akuma attacks. Armor selection also makes a difference. <strong>Compared to Layered armor, having the full Akuma armor equipped provides a big attack boost, stun properties, and the Offset Effect for Drive Impact.</strong> You should use the full armor if you want all of his tools at your disposal.</p><p>Even though Akuma was also featured in the previous game, his inclusion in <em>Wilds</em> is a lot more fleshed out. Here’s hoping the next collaborations are just as deep and feature crossovers with some fun franchises.</p><p>Or Capcom could just make me happier and throw in some love for <em>Dragon’s Dogma 2</em>.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://kotaku.com/monster-hunter-wilds-street-fighter-6-sf6-ticket-akuma-1851785172]]></content:encoded>
