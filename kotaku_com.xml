While the movie got a sequel two years later, Fox axed plans for a full trilogy and we didn’t see Mr. Fantastic, Invisible Woman, Human Torch or The Thing back in theaters until the much-maligned 2015 reboot.

The <em>Fantastic Four </em>movie is weighed down by too many of the worst aspects of its mid-2000s era, and I’m not just talking about very ropey CGI. There’s cheesy butt rock that follows the chaotic playboy Johnny Storm in nearly every scene he gets by himself, half the scenes are bogged down by a stilted Disney Channel awkwardness that never quite reaches endearing camp, and there’s even a blatant, intrusive ad for the original Xbox featured prominently onscreen at one point. But even with these aspects put aside, the movie fails to scratch the surface of why the Fantastic Four have been mainstays in Marvel’s catalog.</p><p>Sure, it hits the two major bullet points: The quartet goes up into space and is exposed to a cosmic cloud that alters their DNA and gives them superpowers, and a person going by the name Victor Von Doom is the baddy. The problem is that <em>Fantastic Four </em>portrays the fiery familial passion of the group with the intensity of lightly flavored mineral water. Ioan Gruffudd and Jessica Alba’s Mr. Fantastic and Invisible Woman are devoid of any romantic magnetism, but I’m supposed to believe they have a storied, angsty past as they argue about Reed’s meticulous nature in a flat monotone. Julian McMahon’s Doom is supposed to complete a love triangle, but everyone in this group talks to each other as if they just met at a bar, aren’t interested in each other, and are trying to politely let each other down. Making matters worse, Doom is such a non-presence in the film that when he starts to do villain-y things, it feels like someone speaking up at a party after sitting in the corner alone for an hour. I don’t believe he loves Sue (or even thinks he does) when he proposes to her. I barely believe that he’s human, even before he gets hit with cosmic rays and turns into a deteriorating metallic villain. Doom as a bastard billionaire instead of a mystical tyrant probably focus-tested better 20 years ago, but it’s another example of the movie robbing the <em>Fantastic Four </em>of any vibrancy.</p><p>The saving graces of the cast are Chris Evans as the Human Torch and Michael Chiklis as the Thing. Though I’m not thrilled with the throat-destroyingly gravelly voice Chiklis puts on, there are affecting moments when he struggles with his new golem-like appearance, trying to find people who will accept him now rather than cower in fear. Evans is the standout, however, and it’s not surprising that he would be the one to stay in the superhero business after these movies. He lucked out, being the only character who’s happy with this superpowered turn of events, but he’s also the only actor who seems excited to be there.</p><h2 id="h537"><a id=""></a><strong>Fantastic Four’s biggest problem is that it’s boring</strong></h2><p>While many are wont to claim the Marvel Cinematic Universe is the harbinger of the end of cinema, at least many of its movies aren’t a complete slog. <em>Fantastic Four</em>, on the other hand,<em> </em>carries itself with a dreary level of self-seriousness. It’s a superpowered soap opera that lacks the charisma or chemistry that makes you care about the drama. The stoicism of this film is so suffocating that even Evans’ joy is smothered.</p><p>That’s <em>Fantastic Four</em>’s biggest problem: not the weird deviations from the source material, but just how boring it all is. Emotionally, visually, and cinematically, everything about the film is flat. I’m surprised that its memetic notoriety for being bad has persisted this long because it’s not even bad in any way that’s interesting; it’s simply forgettable. For a group of heroes known as a family above all else, it’s jarring how much this version of the Fantastic Four feels like coworkers acting out a corporate-mandated skit. It’s giving when your corpo boss says “We’re a family” and throws a pizza party.</p><p>It’s encouraging that <em>First Steps </em>seems to have learned some lessons from Fox’s failures, with the group’s proper MCU debut leaning into a distinct retro-future aesthetic that distinguishes it from the rest of the franchise. Hopefully it feels like the proper adaptation the First Family deserves when it premieres on July 25.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Many other actors tried out for the role in 2006's <em>Casino Royale </em>and their screen tests were recently uploaded to a small YouTube account for the whole world to gawk at. It’s a fascinating inside look at what might have been, and at just how awkward tryouts can be. </p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="197298" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="Live Forever in the Universe of 'New World: Aeternum'" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="108" data-playlist="197298,197284,197260" data-current="197298"><div><p>Live Forever in the Universe of 'New World: Aeternum'</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197298/197298_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197298/197298_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197298/197298_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197298/197298_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"></video></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>Antony Starr, who currently plays the sociopathic Nazi superhero Homelander on <em>The Boys</em>, was one of those candidates tapped to do a screen test for the role of MI6's 007. In it, he recites a scene from the <em>GoldenEye </em>screenplay in which <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oz8TYyn-k40&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oz8TYyn-k40" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Bond is at a Blackjack table flirting with femme fatale assassin Xenia Onatopp</a></span>. Except instead of being in a fancy hotel, he’s acting from a bed in a random hotel room. </p><p>Starr punctuates a lot of the tit-for-tat dialogue with raised eyebrows and cocking his head to the side. There’s a ton of lip-smacking at the start of every line. It’s not great! But it’s one of the better “what if” <em>Bond</em> screen tests the mysterious Ron South YouTube account has uploaded so far:</p><p>Starr had appeared a bunch in the New Zealand show <em>Mercy Peak</em> at the time but was still basically unknown until he broke out years later with the crime drama <em>Banshee</em>. He’s of course best known now for his unhinged role in <em>The Boys</em>, spawning numerous notorious GIFs and memes in the process. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.gamesradar.com/entertainment/james-bond-movies/homelander-actor-antony-starrs-james-bond-screen-test-for-casino-royale-has-been-leaked-online-and-the-boys-fans-are-all-making-the-same-joke/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.gamesradar.com/entertainment/james-bond-movies/homelander-actor-antony-starrs-james-bond-screen-test-for-casino-royale-has-been-leaked-online-and-the-boys-fans-are-all-making-the-same-joke/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">So as <em>Gamesradar</em> notes</a></span>, existing fans have had a field day going back and imaging his James Bond performance through the lens of Homelander. “Breast milk, squeezed not pumped,” joked one user <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/JamesBond/comments/1iionw2/anthony_starr_james_bond_screen_tests_2005/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/JamesBond/comments/1iionw2/anthony_starr_james_bond_screen_tests_2005/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">on Reddit</a></span>. “Lander, Homelander,” wrote another (<span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7vs8tZwRGOs&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7vs8tZwRGOs" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">if you’re not familiar with <em>The Boys </em>then, uh, how do I explain...</a></span>)</p><p>But screen tests are all relative. Moviemakers are looking for something they can work with, cultivate, and shape into what might be best in the final movie once everything is rehearsed, shot, edited, and brought to life with music, sets, costumes, and props. As twitchy and off as Starr’s test looks, Henry Cavill’s was arguably even rougher. </p><p>From the long black hair and facial stubble to the <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://boymeetsworld.fandom.com/wiki/Jonathan_Turner&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://boymeetsworld.fandom.com/wiki/Jonathan_Turner" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Jonathan Turner biker jacket</a></span>, it’s all very not Bond. And then Cavill opens his mouth, almost speaking through gritted teeth, appearing almost ponderous at times. It reads like a young boy trying on daddy’s clothes in the mirror. Maybe a good place to explore for a Bond origin movie, but clearly not what the studio was looking for with <em>Casino Royale</em> (Cavill’s full-blown himbo hunk debut didn’t come until 2011's <em>Immortals</em>). </p><p>Of course, the movie’s producers maintain they always wanted Daniel Craig from the start. You can watch his much more polished screen test and see that they maybe had a point, and Starr, Cavill, and others may have just been backups in case the brooding <em>Layer Cake </em>star never said yes. Sean Connery apparently didn’t make a great first impression either when he was scouted for the role all those years ago. Bond author Ian Flemming <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.thegentlemansjournal.com/article/true-story-how-sean-connery-became-james-bond-007/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.thegentlemansjournal.com/article/true-story-how-sean-connery-became-james-bond-007/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">reportedly hated him for the part</a></span>. It wasn’t until he walked out of the 1962 premiere of <em>Dr. No </em>that he became a believer. </p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
