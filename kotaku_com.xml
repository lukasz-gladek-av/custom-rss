              <p>There’s an extremely <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@hasandpiker/video/7130294631920602410?lang=en">funny clip of political commentator Hasan Piker</a> watching a video in which the guy narrating makes a joke about following Piker for reasons other than “his political views.” Piker pauses the video and goes to check and finds out that the creator does, in fact, subscribe to his Twitch channel, and then after he’s done, he unpauses the video and the narration continues with “thanks for unpausing the video, Hasan.” Piker, knowing he’s been read to filth, screams into his mic because this embarrassing moment has been caught on camera for millions to see. This is basically what just happened to me at Gamescom’s Opening Night Live, in which Obsidian released a new trailer for <em>The Outer Worlds 2</em> focusing on the RPG’s companions. Knowing that the original game didn’t include romantic relationships, I dropped a message in the&nbsp;<em>Kotaku&nbsp;</em>slack asking if I would be able to kiss a space man this time around, only for the trailer to say “and no, you can’t sleep with them” seconds later. Well fuck you, too, Mr. Announcer Guy.</p> <p><iframe loading="lazy" title="The Outer Worlds 2 - Official Companions Trailer - Opening Night Live 2025" width="500" height="281" src="about:blank" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen="" data-rocket-lazyload="fitvidscompatible" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/h8nVW5UGIcg?feature=oembed"></iframe></p> <p>I don’t know shit about fuck regarding this merry band of misfits, but I did see Tristan in all his rugged, bearded glory swinging around a giant hammer and my brain turned off. I can’t so much as give him a light peck on the cheek, but I guess we don’t all get what we want in this life, do we Obsidian? Why would you put this man in front of me if I can’t take a bite? Why show me something if I can’t have it? Isn’t this how <em>Uncut Gems&nbsp;</em>started? Just waving desirable things in front of people willing to pay money for them, only for it all to ultimately end in chaos and destruction?</p> <p>Anyway, <em>The O</em><em>uter Worlds 2&nbsp;</em>is coming to PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series X/S on October 29, and I only accidentally typed&nbsp;<em>Outer Wilds 2</em> once while writing this blog.</p>

              <p><em>The Darkest Files</em> is a game about investigating Nazis long after WWII has ended in order to deliver justice for their victims. And in an unusual moment that punctuated the evening’s typical industry hype, its director, Jörg Friedrich, appeared on stage at Gamescom 2025’s Opening Night Live showcase to highlight why games like his are important.</p> <p>“[The Darkest Files] shows we cannot simply stand by and watch, we must take action,” Friedrich said. “Games are more than entertainment; like any great form of art they reflect our concerns, our fears, our hopes, and what preoccupies us. Democracy is under attack right now. Minority rights are being violated.”</p> <p>He continued, “The world is becoming increasingly interconnected. So games are a powerful medium for addressing these issues and they have the potential to inspire change. I am glad that not only are many people in the video game industry engaging in projects like this but also more and more institutions like the European Commission or the United Nations.”</p> <p>Friedrich’s appearance, and <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2058730/The_Darkest_Files/"><em>The Darkest Files</em></a> being highlighted at the showcase,&nbsp; are part of the event’s Gamescom Cares initiative, which includes trying to give a platform to “responsibility projects.” Others included <em><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2244700/Glasshouse/">Glasshouse</a></em>, a “feudalpunk” CRPG about people trapped in a house during a world war by developer FLAT28, and <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2795590/Compensation_Not_Guaranteed/"><em>Compensation Not Guaranteed</em></a>, a sort of <em>Papers,</em>–<em>Please</em>-meets<em>-Animal</em>–<em>Crossing</em> point-and-click sim about reviewing land documents in a post-colonial country where the government is taking people’s land for urban development.</p> <div role="heading" aria-level="2" data-hveid="CB8QAA" data-ved="2ahUKEwjq1pDxypePAxVyrokEHf8WK5sQtwcoAHoECB8QAA" lang="en-US" data-md="25"> <div data-tts="answers" data-tts-text="Jörg Friedrich"> <p>While Friedrich didn’t say exactly who democracy is under attack from, the comments come amid the backdrop of right-wing authoritarian shifts in several governments across the globe, including President Trump’s recent deployment of military forces on the streets of the U.S. capital. There’s Russia’s ongoing invasion of Ukraine and an increasingly dire humanitarian crisis in Gaza amid <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/08/15/world/middleeast/gaza-children-school-play.html">ongoing reports</a> of the Israeli military shooting civilians and blocking aid.</p>  </div> <p>The brief Gamescom segment was the most overtly political that host Geoff Keighley has ever let one of his showcases get, even if it stopped short of any direct calls to action. While<em> Glasshouse</em> and<em> Compensation Not Guaranteed</em> haven’t been released yet, <em>The Darkest Files</em> released earlier this year on Steam to positive reviews.</p> </div>
