            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><span>We know </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/sonic-4-film-sequel-confirmed-march-spring-2027-sega-1851744323"><i><span>Sonic the Hedgehog 4</span></i></a> <span>is coming in 2027, but it looks like another live-action </span><i><span>Sonic </span></i><span>movie is coming not too long after. Is this the rumored Shadow-centric spin-off we’ve been hearing about? It better be, Paramount.</span></p> <p><span>According to </span><a href="https://variety.com/2025/film/news/sonic-spinoff-movie-teenage-mutant-ninja-turtles-live-action-film-2028-release-dates-1236596459/"><i><span>Variety</span></i></a><span>, Paramount has added a new “Sonic Universe Event Film” to its schedule that will premiere on December 22, 2028, four years after </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/sonic-hedgehog-3-review-shadow-keanu-reeves-jim-carrey-1851726797"><i><span>Sonic the Hedgehog 3</span></i></a> <span>debuted last December. </span><i><span>Variety </span></i><span>notes this movie will be a spin-off, which means it likely won’t follow the blue blur and his friends. There have been longstanding </span><a href="https://www.sonicstadium.org/articles/sonic/rumor-shadow-movie-officially-in-development-at-paramount-they-want-to-do-an-amy-rose-project-r3181/"><span>rumors</span></a><span> that a spin-off movie about Shadow the Hedgehog, Sonic’s black-and-red rival played by Keanu Reeves, was on the table if </span><i><span>Sonic the Hedgehog 3 </span></i><span>did well, and it got around half a billion at the box office.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>Shadow was the antagonist of most of </span><i><span>Sonic 3</span></i><span>, and seemingly sacrificed himself to stop his original plan to destroy the world. The movie’s </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/sonic-hedgehog-3-4-post-credits-amy-rose-metal-shadow-1851726285"><span>final post-credits scene</span></a><span> shows him recovering his inhibitor rings that fell to Earth in the film’s climactic space battle, implying that he would return in a future movie or television series.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><span>What we know so far about </span><i><span>Sonic 4 </span></i><span>makes it sound like Shadow won’t be in the next numbered film, so a spin-off starring him would be the next best thing. Could this be when the film series finally introduces the other members of Shadow’s Team Dark: treasure hunter Rouge the Bat and Eggman’s estranged robot Omega E-123? Please, Paramount. I need Shadow to find his new family after losing everything in </span><i><span>Sonic 3</span></i><span>.</span></p> <p><span>Whatever this movie is, it will premiere just about a year and a half after </span><i><span>Sonic 4</span></i><span>, which is set for theaters on March 19, 2027. The fourth film will focus on newcomers Metal Sonic and</span><a href="https://kotaku.com/sonic-3-post-credits-amy-reverse-sonamy-relationship-1851730058"><span> Amy Rose</span></a><span>, who were teased in </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/new-sonic-3-concept-art-may-clear-up-that-confusing-pos-1851743775"><i><span>Sonic 3</span></i><span>’s post-credits scene</span></a><span>, and seems to be a loose adaptation of </span><i><span>Sonic CD</span></i><span>.</span></p>

            <title><![CDATA[Nightreign‘s Deadliest Field Boss Is Not Who I Expected]]></title>
            <link>https://kotaku.com/nightreigns-bell-bearing-carion-draconic-tree-sentinel-2000649218</link>
            <guid>1369717</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><em>Elden Ring Nightreign</em>‘s first DLC, <em>The Forsaken Hollows</em>, <a href="https://kotaku.com/elden-ring-nightreign-dlc-forsaken-hollows-artorias-dark-souls-2000643101">is out later this week</a>. Ahead of its release, publisher Bandai Namco spilled the beans on which of the roguelike multiplayer game’s field bosses have killed players the most. Anyone who has played for any length of time probably expected Bell Bearing Hunter to be crowned the most deadly, but that honor has actually gone to the Royal Carian Knight. Quiet frankly, I don’t believe it.</p> <p>The newly released info graphic lists the “<a href="https://www.bandainamcoent.com/news/elden-ring-nightreign-eye-of-the-storm-infographic">8 most deadly field bosses</a>.” Field bosses are the major enemies that exist at various points on the map during the day. Strong ones give players better loot and more levels. Also an early grave. Here’s the ranking according to Bandai Namco:</p>

 <ol> <li>Royal Carian Knight</li> <li>Draconic Tree Sentinel</li> <li>Erdtree Avatar</li> <li>Bell Bearing Hunter</li> <li>Pot-Troll</li> <li>Black Blade Kindered</li> <li>Death Rite Bird</li> <li>Ulcerated Tree Spirit</li> </ol> <figure id="attachment_2000649223" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000649223"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000649223">FromSoftware / Bandai Namco</figcaption></figure> <p>The top two aren’t completely out of left field. Both horseback bosses have tons of mobility, are brutal up close, and will wreck you with long-ranged magic attacks, especially if you’re trying to escape. Most of the times I’ve died to one of them, I wasn’t even trying to fight them, just climb up a cliff. Erdtree Avatar is a little more surprising to me. He’s brutal if you’re not ready to fight him, but pretty predictable and easy to avoid once you’ve got decent levels and equipment. So is Death Rite Bird at number seven. I always avoid the Bird at all costs.</p>

 <p>Speaking of avoiding bosses, that brings us to Bell Bearing Hunter. The unsuspecting field boss walks softly but carries a big sword. Many a <em>Nightreign</em> player has encountered him, though “oh yeah, I got this,” and then after landing their first attack and nearly being one-shotted in response, immediately realized “oh no, I actually don’t got this at all.” He’s become a meme in the community for being the one boss everyone knows to avoid. You can tell you’re playing with a new player if you encounter Bell Bearing and they don’t immediately keep running.</p>

 <p>So what’s he doing at number four? There are two possibilities here. 1.) He’s not actually the hardest, and despite his legendary status on the <em>Nightreign</em> subreddit and Discord, players have a way harder time with the Royal Carian Knight and Draconic Tree Sentinel. Or 2.) Bell Bearing has killed fewer players because they never bother fighting him to begin with. It all comes down to whether Bandai Namco is measuring total body count or averaging those proportional to the actual number of encounters. Carian Knight might have killed more players, while Bell Bearing actually has a higher win-rate against them.</p> <p>I’ve asked Bandai Namco for clarification. The <a href="https://kotaku.com/elden-ring-nightreign-deep-night-hard-mode-time-changes-2000624664">mythmaking around <em>Nightreign</em>‘s most legendary boss</a> is at stake. All I know for sure is that when <em>The Forsaken</em> <em>Hollows</em> goes live on December 4, I’m running past both Carian Knight <em>and</em> Bell Bearing.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/assassins-creed-shadows-switch-2-port-gameplay-comparison-ps5-xbox-fps-ubisoft-2000649204</link>
            <guid>1369690</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><em><a href="https://kotaku.com/assassins-creed-shadows-review-is-it-good-xbox-ps5-rpg-1851770647">Assassin’s Creed: Shadows</a>,</em> Ubisoft’s latest big open-world RPG, makes the long-rumored leap to Switch 2 this week, and footage of the game running on Nintendo’s console looks as impressive and playable as the publisher’s previous port of<em><a href="https://kotaku.com/star-wars-outlaws-switch-2-port-patch-is-ithttps://kotaku.com/star-wars-outlaws-switch-2-port-patch-is-it-good-2000624465good-2000624465"> Star Wars: Outlaws</a>.</em></p> <p>When <em>Assassin’s Creed: Shadows</em> launched earlier this year, <a href="https://kotaku.com/assassins-creed-shadows-graphics-seasons-screenshots-1851770252">I called it one of the best-looking open-world video games of the generation</a>. Ubisoft’s digital recreation of Feudal Japan featured multiple seasons, incredible draw distances, gorgeous lighting, rock-solid performance, and highly detailed environments. So when Ubisoft officially announced the long-rumored Switch 2 port of <em>Shadows</em> was real and launching on December 2, I was nervous. Sure, the publisher pulled off a technical marvel by getting <em>Outlaws</em> to run on Switch 2. But would <em>Shadows</em> work as well on Nintendo’s machine? The answer is yes. Yes, indeed.</p>

 <p>Ahead of its Tuesday launch, some folks who have already been playing <em>Shadows</em> on Switch 2 began sharing direct comparisons of the new port with how the game looks on PS5 and Xbox. <a href="https://youtu.be/Lh5sCdKyVlc">YouTube channel ElAnalistaDeBits</a> posted a great video comparing all three versions, and perhaps the biggest takeaway is that while <em>Shadows</em> on Switch has, understandably, cut some graphical corners, it’s still remarkable how alike all versions of the game look side-by-side.</p>

   <p>Like <em>Star Wars: Outlaws</em> on Switch 2, which impressed us earlier this year, <em>Shadows</em> runs at 30 FPS on Nintendo’s console with no option to play at 60FPS. That’s a shame, but also not surprising. It should also be noted that <em>Shadows</em> on Switch 2 isn’t a rock-solid 30, but pretty dang close. And hey, while it might lack a higher-framerate option, the <a href="https://www.ubisoft.com/en-us/game/assassins-creed/news/3eHpj3aktX4nWY150OEHJL/assassins-creed-shadows-deep-dive-into-the-nintendo-switch-2-system-port">Switch 2 port of <em>Shadows</em> lets you manipulate the map using the touchscreen</a>, which is handy.</p>

 <p>The biggest visual cuts found in<em> Assassin’s Creed Shadows</em> on Switch 2 involve reduced draw distance, a less sharp image, and water reflections. In particular, reflections are completely gone in most places on the Switch 2 port, which can make rivers and lakes look dull and flat. On the flipside, texture quality is good and looks more than fine when playing the game in handheld mode. In fact, a lot of these changes will be much harder to spot when playing on the Switch 2’s screen compared to a big 4K TV.</p> <p><em>Star Wars: Outlaws</em> and now <em>Assassin’s Creed Shadows</em> seem to indicate that Ubisoft is taking the Switch 2 very seriously as a platform. The publisher has delivered two of the best-looking and playing <a href="https://kotaku.com/switch-2-ports-cyberpunk-2077-ps4-ps5-xbox-dlss-outlaws-1851782817">open-world games on the console this year</a>, and I imagine past Ubisoft titles will likely be making the leap in the future. And with cross save across all consoles and PC, the Switch 2 might become a very popular way for Ubisoft open world sicko fans, like myself, to enjoy these big games on the go or when traveling.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><span>It’s been almost three months since right-wing commentator Charlie Kirk was </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/charlie-kirk-shooter-helldivers-bullet-engraving-2000625439"><span>assassinated in September</span></a><span>. When it happened, the right was quick to </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/sucker-punch-charlie-kirk-ghost-yotei-boycott-2000646987"><span>tear down anyone who didn’t suddenly forget his prejudiced rhetoric when he was killed</span></a><span>, but in the months since, a lot of the fallout of Kirk’s death has been in memes, whether that be in </span><a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@anaylhc/video/7574231060104465686?lang=en"><span>“Kirkifying” images</span></a><span> by photoshopping his face on anything you can find, </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/charlie-kirk-assassination-bandai-namco-ai-model-gunpla-2000626472"><span>AI mock-ups of gunpla sets</span></a><span> of his death, or </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/nba-2k26-charlie-kirk-character-creator-neck-tattoo-2000629891"><span>creating characters that look like him in video games</span></a><span>. In the past few weeks, an AI-generated song about Kirk has begun spreading throughout the internet, and you’ve probably heard it in fandom spaces online.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZUHpUXlsvbI"><span>“We Are Charlie Kirk”</span></a><span> is a three-and-a-half-minute, AI-generated slop song by AI “artist” Spalexma. As the name implies, the song is meant to be a tribute to Kirk, and a declaration that his supporters will “carry the flame” of his right-wing views. It is absolutely one of the most ostentatious, dramatic pieces of “music” I’ve ever heard. The song was originally posted just a week after Kirk’s death, but it has gained significant traction on various platforms in the weeks since.</span></p>

  <p><span>The AI singer is belting with the passion you’d typically hear in an ‘80s power ballad, all about how those still on Earth will pick up the torch now that Kirk is gone. Whether the AI slop was meant as a genuine tribute to Kirk or a musical encapsulation of the right’s self-important made-up war on behalf of Christianity, the song has, like much of the reaction to Kirk’s death, been swept up in the shitpost factory, and the internet has been littered with videos set to the song with more views than the original. Some videos play it straight, simply using its hokey, anthemic instrumentation as a backdrop for dramatic imagery. Others have basically made it a modern-day Rick Roll, a musical rugpull meant to troll anyone who passes by it online.</span></p>

 <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">Disney has updated the ‘GUARDIANS OF THE GALAXY’ soundtrack after several music licenses expired.</p> <p>(via: Disney+) <a href="https://t.co/7VGxePHyOv">pic.twitter.com/7VGxePHyOv</a></p> <p>— Wong Updates (@WongUpdates) <a href="https://twitter.com/WongUpdates/status/1994897434758320635?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 29, 2025</a></p></blockquote>               <p><span>While a lot of “We Are Charlie Kirk’s” appearances are rooted in internet-poisoned irony, a lot of people are using the song to make fun of the right’s cult-like admiration for its political figures, like this video in which someone saw a truck covered in images of Kirk and the American Flag. There’s a comment under this one that says, “They don’t even treat Jesus like this.”&nbsp;</span></p>     <p><span>“We Are Charlie Kirk” is currently Spalexma’s most-popular song on streaming services like Spotify, but even there, its streams are dwarfed by the views videos using it have gotten over the past three months. So it seems like most people aren’t listening to it unironically. The AI “artist” has several other songs that seem to be Christian in nature, so I assume this song was meant to be an earnest tribute to Kirk, but the internet has definitely not taken it that way, and continues to run it into the ground.</span></p> <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">"what are we?" we are charlie kirk girl</p> <p>— brandon (@BR0IG) <a href="https://twitter.com/BR0IG/status/1992709018201317653?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 23, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">some kids on the bus started blasting we are charlie kirk &amp; the hooded guy in front of me turned round to look at them and it was riz ahmed <a href="https://t.co/QhWZnWVbyC">pic.twitter.com/QhWZnWVbyC</a></p> <p>— lú (@botaniyya) <a href="https://twitter.com/botaniyya/status/1994448939764904010?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 28, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">“We are Charlie Kirk, we carry the flame, we fight for the gospel, we'll honor his name.” <a href="https://t.co/WzQhLav68c">pic.twitter.com/WzQhLav68c</a></p> <p>— Just a Random JOLLY Person 🎄☃️ (@aRandom_acc_) <a href="https://twitter.com/aRandom_acc_/status/1994122109195563292?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 27, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">"We are all Charlie Kirk" <a href="https://t.co/hZUO5F3ivT">pic.twitter.com/hZUO5F3ivT</a></p> <p>— TheRealThelmaJohnson (@TheRealThelmaJ1) <a href="https://twitter.com/TheRealThelmaJ1/status/1992828878029828213?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 24, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">teto: we, are, charlie kirk. we are charlie kirk</p> <p>miku: we, are, charlie kirk. we are charlie kirk</p> <p>neru: we, are, charlie kirk. we are charlie kirk</p> <p>all 3 together: we, are, charlie kirk. we are charlie kirk <a href="https://t.co/RV1PMnafpv">pic.twitter.com/RV1PMnafpv</a></p> <p>— REIKA (@0_ka815) <a href="https://twitter.com/0_ka815/status/1991768913039004058?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 21, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">GTA 6 will reportedly feature a “We Are Charlie Kirk” radio station that loops the track for roughly 6/7 hours 🔥‼️ <a href="https://t.co/6dkjoNxxja">pic.twitter.com/6dkjoNxxja</a></p> <p>— GTA 6 Info (@GTASixInfo) <a href="https://twitter.com/GTASixInfo/status/1993760858368078228?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 26, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">this is part of the reason why the "we are charlie kirk" and "kirkification" memes went insanely viral. you can't mandate reverence for a generation that saw their classmates get slaughtered in school shootings. <a href="https://t.co/LQkovzmD7f">https://t.co/LQkovzmD7f</a></p> <p>— hasanabi (@hasanthehun) <a href="https://twitter.com/hasanthehun/status/1994510376046834132?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 28, 2025</a></p></blockquote>

              <p>“Nostalgia is remembering when you didn’t have to pay bills and attributing that feeling to Mario.” That’s what my head <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/did:plc:hdvm3rm4juqhxk5nqvzopzhm/post/3lkz225nyfk2e">tells me</a>, anyway. My heart, on the other hand, leaps and applauds every time the plumber embarks on a new adventure. Let’s not beat around the bush: <a href="https://kotaku.com/marvel-cosmic-invasion-hands-on-preview-mvc-impressions-2000614681"><em>Marvel Cosmic Invasion</em></a> is a nostalgia play. Its best trick is briefly reminding you of when your life was someone else’s problem. It’s a lazy morning spent watching cartoons. It’s wasting a fistful of quarters on the <em>X-Men</em> machine at the arcade, barely beating the second stage, and not regretting a single moment. It’s one of the slickest, most fun beat ’em ups I’ve played in a while. Making the old-school, repetitive button-mashing formula feel this good and fresh again in 2025 is no small feat.</p> <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/xbox-game-pass-marvel-cosmic-invasion-moonlighter-2000645207">Out December 1</a>, <em>Marvel Cosmic Invasion</em> pits Captain America, Spider-Man, Wolverine, and more against the Negative Zone’s Anihiilus and the alien insectoids’ latest attempt to take over the galaxy. The result is a sprawling cast of 15 playable characters, including back-benchers like Ghost Rider and Phyla-Vell, each with unique animations, moves, special abilities, and voiced dialogue, hopscotching through a greatest hits reel of Marvel locations, villains, and recent movie lore tie-ins. The story doesn’t go much deeper than Anihilius using his alien parasites to mind-control everyone from Master Mold to Galactus, but it doesn’t need to. We’re here to smash stuff, and it’s as good an excuse as any to have you trading blows with bad guys as well as heroes.</p> <div>           <ul>                           <li>                 <p>Back-of-the-box quote:</p>                 <p>"Holy Flark!"</p>               </li>                                         <li>                 <p>Developer</p>                 <p>Tribute Games and Dotemu</p>               </li>                                         <li>                 <p>Type of game:</p>                 <p>Nostalgic button-masher </p>               </li>                                         <li>                 <p>Liked</p>                 <p>Swapping heroes, unique movesets, top-class pixel art animations </p>               </li>                               </ul><ul>                                         <li>                 <p>Disliked:</p>                 <p>Some levels feel short and enemies get a bit same-y</p>               </li>                                         <li>                 <p>Platforms:</p>                 <p>Xbox Series X/S, Xbox One, PS5 (played), PS4, Switch, PC  </p>               </li>                                         <li>                 <p>Release date:</p>                 <p>December 1, 2025</p>               </li>                                         <li>                 <p>Played</p>                 <p>10 hours. Five to finish the main campaign, another five on arcade mode and unlocking extras. Still have tons of challenges and achievements to complete. </p>               </li>                                     </ul>         </div>  <p>The overall structure is very similar to <a href="https://kotaku.com/tmnt-shredders-revenge-review-tribute-game-dotemu-multi-1849077972"><em>Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Shredder’s Revenge</em></a>, the last 2D arcade throwback Tribute Games (<em>Flinthoo</em>k, <i>Mercenary Kings</i>) made with Dotemu (<em>Streets of Rage 4</em>, <i>Windjammers 2</i>). There are 16 levels, each filled with small bits of environmental storytelling and gorgeous backgrounds. You fight a bunch of mobs, find some collectibles, complete extra challenges, and go up against a boss in a race to see whose health meter depletes first. It’s in the details, though, that <em>Marvel Cosmic Invasion</em> distinguishes itself. The most important is a hero-swapping mechanic that makes it feel as much a descendant of Marvel vs. Capcom as the original 1992 <em>X-Men</em> arcade beat ’em up.</p>

 <h2>A sprinkle of <em>Marvel vs. Capcom</em> and a touch of <em>Diablo</em></h2> <p>Every hero has a punch, a dodge, or a block, and a special ability and ultimate that are both on cooldowns. Instead of just selecting one character to play as in each level, you can pick two and switch between them at will. You’ll want to do this because some characters can fly while others can’t. Black Panther is quick and deadly at close range, but struggles from far away or up in the air. Iron Man can pepper enemies like Mega Man or knee-stomp them from the air. Phoenix can use her telekinetic abilities to grab foes and fling them across the screen back at one another. Most importantly, you can call your second hero in to punch enemies with you or fire off a quick ultimate attack whenever you want.</p>

 <figure id="attachment_2000649172" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000649172"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000649172">Image: Tribute Games / Dotemu / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p>This makes the moment-to-moment gameplay a lot quicker and more dense than your standard side-scrolling beat ’em up or even 2023’s <em>Shredder’s Revenge</em>. By the end of my initial playthrough, I was firing off all of Iron Man’s blasts, closing the distance with his down diagonal jump-kick attack, calling in Jean Grey for an extra pummeling, using my giant beam canon ultimate, and then swapping back to the X-Men to unload her cooldown attacks. The meter for your special attacks builds up over time instead of with each basic attack, letting you be a lot more choosy and strategic about how you engage in fights. It almost feels a bit like <em>Diablo</em> at times, except you’re much more likely to get punished the moment you try to go on autopilot.</p>

 <p>Heroes level up to 10 and unlock small buffs along the way, but there’s no build-crafting to save you here, only your thumbs. Adding another dimension to combat is a dynamic health bar borrowed from <a href="https://kotaku.com/smashing-punks-feels-great-in-streets-of-rage-4-1833621783"><em>Streets of Rage 4</em></a>. Get attacked, and a chunk of the bar becomes discolored. Go long enough killing enemies without getting hit again, and you’ll be able to heal it back. On normal difficulty, <em>Marvel Cosmic Invasion</em> is rarely challenging enough to make you think hard about how this mechanic fits into the overall rhythm of combat, but it’s still an interesting wrinkle that gives the game a bit more flair than some lesser releases in the genre.</p>

 <figure id="attachment_2000649173" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000649173"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000649173">Marvel Cosmic Invasion has a CRT filter option (middle), including a curved display (far right). Image: Tribute Games / Dotemu / Kotaku)</figcaption></figure> <p>I spent most of my time playing two-player couch co-op. <em>Marvel Cosmic Invasion</em>‘s big ultimates and onscreen enemy count made this feel just the right level of busy, even if sometimes it still veers into chaotic spectacle over precision action. It makes me wonder if four players, while still fun, might start to just feel like a big trash can of nachos: novel, tasty, and way too much. The only time I ever got slight framerate drops playing on PS5 was when several characters on the screen were performing flying animations at the same time. It’s not rated for Steam Deck yet, but it performed just fine on my Rog Xbox Ally X.</p>

 <h2>A dazzling adventure that ends too soon</h2> <p><em>Marvel Cosmic Invasion</em> has some very cool levels, including an Asgard visit that has you fighting aliens across a technicolor Bifrost rainbow bridge. It also has some filler ones that left a very little impression. They just felt like long corridors filled with familiar foes. Enemy variety is decent, but rarely requires mixing up tactics too much. By the home stretch, I was definitely a bit disappointed to keep blasting the same sentinels, bugs, and symbiotes I’d been thrashing all game. The cast of heroes and their bespoke loadouts is so impressive that it can leave the rest of the game struggling to measure up. Give players an inventive toolbox box and they’ll start looking for problems that can’t be solved by pumping the same button over and over again for several hours.</p>

 <figure id="attachment_2000649170" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000649170"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000649170">Image: Tribute Games / Dotemu / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p>This sameness remains an inextricable part of <em>Marvel Cosmic Invasion</em>‘s charm, though. It sets you up in cool cosplay, gives you wild powers, and unleashes you in a 2D candy shop whose aisles shatter and explode in the most satisfying ways. Every character has a distinct moveset. Rocket Raccoon can slide into enemies and place mines or throw grenades. Beta Ray Bill can smash the ground with his hammer or throw it and keep it suspended in mid-air, spinning as it keeps comboing enemies into the side of the screen. The only thing more impressive than the game’s roster is its dedication to making each one feel as fleshed out and lovingly crafted as any retro game’s main character.</p> <p>Early brawlers were designed to test patience, eat wallets, and make players navigate the pitfalls of letting tedium lull them into an unwarranted sense of complacency. To completely give yourself over to the monotony of a beat ’em up, like letting your sleepy eyes glance shut on the highway, is to court existential danger. The game, like life, will punch back the moment you let your guard down. <em>Marvel Cosmic Invasion</em> adds a new layer of spectacle and moveset management to the fray that, at times, borders on the breadth and creative possibilities you’d more often find in a fighting game.</p> <p>It’s over too soon and just one extra mode shy of what might feel like a more complete experience. If it follows the mold of Shredder’s Revenge, we’ll get a steady cadence of free updates and a paid DLC at some point. But for now, it does exactly what it needs to: add fresh tricks to a classic genre that makes it feel like you’re a ’90s Marvel action figure rampaging through a Saturday morning cartoon.</p>
