Presumably, the “mouse operation” feature will allow some games on Switch 2 to be played with either traditional controller inputs or mouse inputs. </p><p>That could make it ideal for games like <em>Civilization 7</em> and potentially shooters like <em>Fortnite </em>and<em> Call of Duty</em>, which Microsoft is expected to begin porting to the Switch 2 at some point in the future. Other Microsoft shooters like <em>Halo</em> and <em>Doom</em> are also expected to get ported at some point, and the new Joy-Con could let players aim with traditional PC mouse precision while moving and strafing with a controller thumbstick. </p><p>Even more exciting is how Nintendo might find ways to use a dual-mouse feature for creative new gameplay. One of the patent drawings shows both Joy-Con being used as mice simultaneously. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.patreon.com/jeffgerstmann&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.patreon.com/jeffgerstmann" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">On his podcast</a></span>, <em>Giant Bomb</em> co-founder Jeff Gerstmann speculated that dual mice might let players control something like a mech with two reticles for aiming arm-mounted weapons.

The publisher behind <em>Borderlands, Mafia, Bioshock, NBA 2K,</em> and more has marked down nearly all of its games available on Valve’s PC storefront. The exact discount varies game to game, but overall this is a massive sale that includes newer games like<em> </em><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/marvel-midnight-suns-impressions-xcom-firaxis-pc-rpg-1849793171&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/marvel-midnight-suns-impressions-xcom-firaxis-pc-rpg-1849793171"><em>Midnight Suns</em></a></span> and older games like <em>Civilization III.</em> The sale ends on February 20, which is cute. </p><p>The biggest deal in the 20th Anniversary sale, though, is the “20 for 20" bundle. This brings together 20 games into one big package that only costs $20. Here are the games included in the bundle: </p><blockquote data-type="BlockQuote"><ul data-type="List" data-style="Bullet"><li><em>Sid Meier’s Civilization® IV, </em></li><li><em>Sid Meier’s Pirates!</em></li><li><em>Sid Meier’s Railroads!</em></li><li><em>Railroad Tycoon 3</em></li><li><em>BioShock</em></li><li><em>Borderlands Game of the Year </em>(And its DLC)</li><li><em>The Misadventures of P.B.

Seems like a great deal! And it is, but whether or not it’s a great deal <em>for you </em>depends on something. See, this bundle doesn’t give you a discount if you already own one or more games in it. And you don’t get extra copies of those games you already own. </p><p>So if, for example, you own<em> BioShock, The Darkness II, </em>and <em>Borderlands</em> already, you still have to pay $20 for this bundle and you don’t get digital copies of those games to give to friends. In that example, the deal becomes less great. It’s still not bad and you might still want the other games in the 20 for 20 bundle, but just double-check what you own already before purchasing the package. </p><p> .<br></p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

The <em>Fantastic Four </em>movie is weighed down by too many of the worst aspects of its mid-2000s era, and I’m not just talking about very ropey CGI. There’s cheesy butt rock that follows the chaotic playboy Johnny Storm in nearly every scene he gets by himself, half the scenes are bogged down by a stilted Disney Channel awkwardness that never quite reaches endearing camp, and there’s even a blatant, intrusive ad for the original Xbox featured prominently onscreen at one point. But even with these aspects put aside, the movie fails to scratch the surface of why the Fantastic Four have been mainstays in Marvel’s catalog.</p><p>Sure, it hits the two major bullet points: The quartet goes up into space and is exposed to a cosmic cloud that alters their DNA and gives them superpowers, and a person going by the name Victor Von Doom is the baddy. The problem is that <em>Fantastic Four </em>portrays the fiery familial passion of the group with the intensity of lightly flavored mineral water. Ioan Gruffudd and Jessica Alba’s Mr. Fantastic and Invisible Woman are devoid of any romantic magnetism, but I’m supposed to believe they have a storied, angsty past as they argue about Reed’s meticulous nature in a flat monotone. Julian McMahon’s Doom is supposed to complete a love triangle, but everyone in this group talks to each other as if they just met at a bar, aren’t interested in each other, and are trying to politely let each other down. Making matters worse, Doom is such a non-presence in the film that when he starts to do villain-y things, it feels like someone speaking up at a party after sitting in the corner alone for an hour. I don’t believe he loves Sue (or even thinks he does) when he proposes to her. I barely believe that he’s human, even before he gets hit with cosmic rays and turns into a deteriorating metallic villain. Doom as a bastard billionaire instead of a mystical tyrant probably focus-tested better 20 years ago, but it’s another example of the movie robbing the <em>Fantastic Four </em>of any vibrancy.</p><p>The saving graces of the cast are Chris Evans as the Human Torch and Michael Chiklis as the Thing. Though I’m not thrilled with the throat-destroyingly gravelly voice Chiklis puts on, there are affecting moments when he struggles with his new golem-like appearance, trying to find people who will accept him now rather than cower in fear. Evans is the standout, however, and it’s not surprising that he would be the one to stay in the superhero business after these movies. He lucked out, being the only character who’s happy with this superpowered turn of events, but he’s also the only actor who seems excited to be there.</p><h2 id="h12753"><a id=""></a><strong>Fantastic Four’s biggest problem is that it’s boring</strong></h2><p>While many are wont to claim the Marvel Cinematic Universe is the harbinger of the end of cinema, at least many of its movies aren’t a complete slog. <em>Fantastic Four</em>, on the other hand,<em> </em>carries itself with a dreary level of self-seriousness. It’s a superpowered soap opera that lacks the charisma or chemistry that makes you care about the drama. The stoicism of this film is so suffocating that even Evans’ joy is smothered.</p><p>That’s <em>Fantastic Four</em>’s biggest problem: not the weird deviations from the source material, but just how boring it all is. Emotionally, visually, and cinematically, everything about the film is flat. I’m surprised that its memetic notoriety for being bad has persisted this long because it’s not even bad in any way that’s interesting; it’s simply forgettable. For a group of heroes known as a family above all else, it’s jarring how much this version of the Fantastic Four feels like coworkers acting out a corporate-mandated skit. It’s giving when your corpo boss says “We’re a family” and throws a pizza party.</p><p>It’s encouraging that <em>First Steps </em>seems to have learned some lessons from Fox’s failures, with the group’s proper MCU debut leaning into a distinct retro-future aesthetic that distinguishes it from the rest of the franchise. Hopefully it feels like the proper adaptation the First Family deserves when it premieres on July 25.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

He’s of course best known now for his unhinged role in <em>The Boys</em>, spawning numerous notorious GIFs and memes in the process. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.gamesradar.com/entertainment/james-bond-movies/homelander-actor-antony-starrs-james-bond-screen-test-for-casino-royale-has-been-leaked-online-and-the-boys-fans-are-all-making-the-same-joke/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.gamesradar.com/entertainment/james-bond-movies/homelander-actor-antony-starrs-james-bond-screen-test-for-casino-royale-has-been-leaked-online-and-the-boys-fans-are-all-making-the-same-joke/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">So as <em>Gamesradar</em> notes</a></span>, existing fans have had a field day going back and imaging his James Bond performance through the lens of Homelander. “Breast milk, squeezed not pumped,” joked one user <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/JamesBond/comments/1iionw2/anthony_starr_james_bond_screen_tests_2005/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/JamesBond/comments/1iionw2/anthony_starr_james_bond_screen_tests_2005/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">on Reddit</a></span>. “Lander, Homelander,” wrote another (<span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7vs8tZwRGOs&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7vs8tZwRGOs" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">if you’re not familiar with <em>The Boys </em>then, uh, how do I explain...</a></span>)</p><p>But screen tests are all relative. Moviemakers are looking for something they can work with, cultivate, and shape into what might be best in the final movie once everything is rehearsed, shot, edited, and brought to life with music, sets, costumes, and props. As twitchy and off as Starr’s test looks, Henry Cavill’s was arguably even rougher. </p><p>From the long black hair and facial stubble to the <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://boymeetsworld.fandom.com/wiki/Jonathan_Turner&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://boymeetsworld.fandom.com/wiki/Jonathan_Turner" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Jonathan Turner biker jacket</a></span>, it’s all very not Bond. And then Cavill opens his mouth, almost speaking through gritted teeth, appearing almost ponderous at times. It reads like a young boy trying on daddy’s clothes in the mirror. Maybe a good place to explore for a Bond origin movie, but clearly not what the studio was looking for with <em>Casino Royale</em> (Cavill’s full-blown himbo hunk debut didn’t come until 2011's <em>Immortals</em>). </p><p>Of course, the movie’s producers maintain they always wanted Daniel Craig from the start. You can watch his much more polished screen test and see that they maybe had a point, and Starr, Cavill, and others may have just been backups in case the brooding <em>Layer Cake </em>star never said yes. Sean Connery apparently didn’t make a great first impression either when he was scouted for the role all those years ago. Bond author Ian Flemming <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.thegentlemansjournal.com/article/true-story-how-sean-connery-became-james-bond-007/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.thegentlemansjournal.com/article/true-story-how-sean-connery-became-james-bond-007/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">reportedly hated him for the part</a></span>. It wasn’t until he walked out of the 1962 premiere of <em>Dr. No </em>that he became a believer. </p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
