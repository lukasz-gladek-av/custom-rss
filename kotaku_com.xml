            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>It’s been nine years since <a href="https://kotaku.com/nier-automata-the-kotaku-review-1793002839"><em>Nier: Automata</em></a> first graced the PlayStation 4 and broke through to players beyond director Yoko Taro’s usual esoteric action-RPG fandom. But there hasn’t been a new game since. Fans are desperate for that to chance. Square Enix just gave them fresh hope.</p> <p>“<em>Nier: Automata</em> to be continued.” That’s how a celebratory trailer during an anniversary livestream on Friday ended. It could mean a lot of things. Fans hope it means <em>Nier: Automata 2</em>, or a fresh RPG within the <em>Nier</em> lineage that goes wherever Taro wants to take it.</p>

 <p>The action-RPG stars an android named 2B in a post-apocalyptic world where human-made robots are at war with invading alien machines. Developed by PlatinumGames, the combat sings and thanks to Taro’s baroque storytelling process, the game must be played and <a href="https://kotaku.com/every-time-nier-automata-ends-it-gets-better-1793524744">finished multiple times</a> to reveal its true secrets.</p>  <p>Set in the same world as <a href="https://kotaku.com/the-nier-replicant-remaster-does-many-good-things-and-o-1846743596">2010’s <em>Nier</em></a>, it succeeded way beyond the cult-classic legacy of the original. A PS4 exclusive when it first launched, Nier: Automata was also a surprising bright spot in a mixed portfolio at Square Enix. The company announced the game surpassed 10 million sales in this week’s anniversary stream. The obvious questions is why <em>wouldn’t</em> the<em> Final Fantasy</em> maker greenlight a sequel?</p>

 <p>2B has been in plenty of other games as a guest character (or costume), and a mobile spin-off <a href="https://kotaku.com/nier-reincarnation-shut-down-1851206958"><em>Nier Reincarnation</em></a> launched in 2021. But there’s never been a proper console sequel. If Square’s latest tease is actually for another mobile game, manga spin-off, or some other sort of transmedia adaptation, fans will riot.</p>

 <h2>What has Yoko Taro been up to?</h2> <p>For all of the love around his games, Taro hasn’t been shy about his struggles to get a new project off the ground. “I often get told stuff like ‘Why aren’t you making a new sequel to&nbsp;<em>NieR</em>?’ or ‘Yoko Taro isn’t doing anything,’ but that’s because recently, a lot of projects I was involved in got discontinued midway through development,” he said <a href="https://kotaku.com/please-stop-cancelling-yoko-taros-games-2000644949">back in 2025</a>.</p> <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="ja" dir="ltr">９周年記念放送おわりました！ご視聴ご来場頂いた皆様、アリガトウゴザイマシタ！！ <a href="https://t.co/BCNwYjqcIz">https://t.co/BCNwYjqcIz</a> <a href="https://t.co/rdG1KkYeYN">pic.twitter.com/rdG1KkYeYN</a></p> <p>— yokotaro (@yokotaro) <a href="https://twitter.com/yokotaro/status/2024842023375929506?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">February 20, 2026</a></p></blockquote>  <p>“I’ve actually been working on some stuff, it’s just that it never ended up seeing the light of day,” he continued. “I got paid for it, so I personally have no issues with that, but people seem to think that I haven’t been doing anything just because none of the work I’ve done is being released.”</p>

 <p>It’s hard to believe that the guy who only ever appears in public wearing a mask of one of the characters from the first <em>Nier</em> wouldn’t want to keep working on the franchise. He appeared in the this week’s anniversary stream and tweeted about the new sales milestone but hasn’t let any cryptic hints slip about the franchise’s future. Yet.</p> <p>But if we somehow never got a new Nier: Automata game, well, that would be sort of fitting as well. “Life is unfair,” he told&nbsp;<em>Kotaku</em> <a href="https://kotaku.com/life-is-unfair-a-q-a-with-nier-automatas-director-1795653562">back in 2017</a>.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[What To Expect From The Big 30th Anniversary Pokémon Day Presents Showcase]]></title>
            <link>https://kotaku.com/pokemon-presents-where-when-to-watch-generation-10-switch-2000671968</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><span>The Pokémon Company finally, in the dead of night, announced its annual Pokémon Day Presents showcase. This is the stream the company hosts every year on February 27 to celebrate the franchise’s anniversary. </span><i><span>Pokémon </span></i><span>is turning 30 in 2026, so there’s probably a lot to share ahead of the coming year. Here’s what we know and what we can likely expect to see next week.</span></p> <h2><b>When and where can I watch?</b></h2> <p><span>The Pokémon Presents stream will air on Friday, February 27, at 9 a.m. Eastern/6 a.m. Pacific. You can catch it on the </span><a href="https://www.youtube.com/@pokemon"><span>official </span><i><span>Pokémon </span></i><span>YouTube</span></a><span> and </span><a href="https://www.twitch.tv/pokemon"><span>Twitch</span></a><span> channels to watch it live, or as a VOD if you can’t tune into the show as it premieres. We’ll also have a recap of what we see here at </span><i><span>Kotaku</span></i><span> if you just want the highlights.</span></p>

 <h2><b>What do we know?</b></h2> <p><span>Right now, the only project confirmed to make an appearance are the </span><i><span>Pokémon FireRed </span></i><span>and </span><i><span>LeafGreen </span></i><span>ports that were </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-fire-red-leaf-green-switch-pokemon-direct-price-2000671938"><span>announced alongside the presentation</span></a><span>. The showcase will last 25 minutes, according to the </span><a href="https://x.com/Pokemon_cojp/status/2024755907343557064"><span>Japanese Pokémon Twitter account</span></a><span>, which makes it </span><a href="https://x.com/JoeMerrick/status/2024760273723146356"><span>one of the longer Pokémon Day showcases</span></a><span> since Nintendo and friends started hosting these.</span></p> <h2><b>What will we likely see?</b></h2> <p><span>The Pokémon Presents showcases cover pretty much everything going on in the franchise right now, so if you’re only interested in the next big RPG, be ready to endure segments devoted to other things. We’ll see updates on mobile games like </span><i><span>Pokémon Masters EX</span></i><span>, </span><i><span>Pokémon Go</span></i><span>, and </span><i><span>Pokémon Sleep</span></i><span>, as well as other major pillars of the franchise like the anime and </span><i><span>Trading Card Game</span></i><span>. </span><i><span>Pokémon Pokopia </span></i><span>is also out the following week, so I’m sure we’ll see at least a little bit more of that game as we approach its March 5 release date.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><span>Since this is the 30th anniversary, we can probably expect some portion of the showcase to be dedicated to upcoming events, both online and off, celebrating the milestone. The Pokémon Company has confirmed plans to hold separate events for both families and adults with its </span><a href="https://www.pokemon.com/us/pokemon-news/get-ready-to-celebrate-30-years-of-pokemon"><span>Day Out and Night Out events,</span></a><span> with the former being geared toward all ages and the latter being suited for “longtime fans,” which is code for people who were relatively cognizant when the series debuted 30 years ago. Right now, we don’t know what these events will entail, so a 30th anniversary stream is as good a place as any to finally lift the curtain.</span></p>

 <p><span>Based on the many leaks that have come from Game Freak over the past few years, we know a fair bit about the upcoming Generation X games, </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-gen-10-wind-wave-map-leak-pikachu-professor-2000655613"><span>reportedly called </span><i><span>Pokémon Wind </span></i><span>and </span><i><span>Wave</span></i></a><span>. It’s very likely that these RPGs will take up a good portion of the showcase. I would be very surprised if </span><i><span>Pokémon </span></i><span>didn’t release a new RPG during its 30th year, and the leaks heavily imply these games are next on the docket, so we could be seeing the next generation of </span><i><span>Pokémon </span></i><span>next week.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>Whatever is announced, we’ll have coverage of the stream here at </span><i><span>Kotaku</span></i><span> as it’s happening.</span></p>

              <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-day-firered-leafgreen-switch-2-port-eshop-online-2000668213">The rumors were true!</a> As <a href="https://twitter.com/Riddler_Khu/status/2021518874785841331?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E2021518874785841331%7Ctwgr%5E84390244049800bd06a3aa327dea273d54fee7b6%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fkotaku.com%2Fpokemon-day-firered-leafgreen-switch-2-port-eshop-online-2000668213">anticipated</a> by Pokémon leaker Khu, <i>Pokémon FireRed&nbsp;</i>and&nbsp;<i>LeafGreen—</i>the Game Boy Advance remakes of the original English-language&nbsp;<em>Pokémon&nbsp;</em>games—are coming to Switch and Switch 2 February 27. They’ll be available as downloads as soon as the 30th anniversary Pokémon Direct comes to an end.</p> <p>So yes indeed, this confirms what was absolutely certain: that there would be a Pokémon Direct this Pokémon Day, during which it seems utterly impossible that we won’t get our first glimpse of Gen X Pokémon and the new mainline game in which they’ll appear. We now also have the time: February 27, 2026 at 9 a.m. ET.</p>

  <p>The arrival of these two 22-year-old versions of a 30-year-old game as a paid download, and not as new entries in the GBA section of Nintendo’s Online subscription package, is a bizarre and pretty shocking choice. Some might say a mercenary one. There surely was the potential that they could have been made available for free to celebrate the franchise’s 30th birthday, and given how ancient they are and how appropriate it would be…that’s obviously not happening. It’s Nintendo. If your uncle worked for Nintendo, he’d charge you for those imaginary leaks. So yeah, astonishingly the company has the complete gall to charge $20 for each. And it won’t even support online features.</p> <p>Ew, what a horrid taste that leaves in my mouth. The GBA versions of these two games had sold a combined total of 11.82 million copies in their first four years on sale. That’s over $400 million. They kinda made their money back. Nintendo could so easily celebrate this huge anniversary by having these be available for free, or at least a couple of bucks, gain so much good will, and get nostalgic players hyped for <em>Pokémon</em> again ahead of the release of the new game this winter. Gah. Twenty sodding dollars.</p>

 <p>And if you’re thinking, “But surely someone at Nintendo must be aware how bad this looks?” you’re right! Because this announcement comes with the most extraordinary FAQ in which Nintendo asks itself everyone you and I would want to know, and then <em>evades its own questions</em>.</p>

 <blockquote><p><b>“Will these games also be coming to the Game Boy Advance – Nintendo Classics collection?</b>These games are being offered as standalone software and are not planned for release as part of the Game Boy Advance – Nintendo Classics collection.</p> <p><b>Why are you handling these classic games differently?</b>In celebration of 30 years of Pokémon, we thought it would be fun to return to the ultimate versions of the original Pokémon adventures in the Kanto region with these special releases.”</p></blockquote> <p>That’s incredible, right! Like there’s this voice inside Nintendo’s head, the voice of reason, and it’s trying to understand why it’s making these choices, but then shouted down by non-answers that don’t address the issue at all. It’s not even the only time it happens in this FAQ:</p> <blockquote><p><b>“Will you add the original Pokémon Red Version and Pokémon Blue Version or other Pokémon games to the Nintendo Classics collections available with Nintendo Switch Online?</b></p> <p>The following Pokémon game is currently part of the Game Boy – Nintendo Classics collection, available with a Nintendo Switch Online membership:</p> <p>[List of non-mainline <em>Pokémon</em> games]”</p></blockquote> <p>It’s like watching a politician being interviewed on TV, and being left screaming at the screen because the interviewer didn’t follow up.</p>
