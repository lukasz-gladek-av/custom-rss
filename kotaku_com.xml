              <p><span>Rare </span><i><span>Pokémon </span></i><span>cards are locked up in one of the most secure locations in the United States. The Surging Sparks Pikachu, which includes a full art illustration of the little yellow guy adorned in a Stellar-type Tera crown, is sitting in a Lucky Box vending machine in the Pentagon food court. Good luck getting into that, </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-card-shops-robbed-100k-nyc-masked-thieves-anime-backpacks-recently-opened-2000660233"><span>card robbers</span></a><span>.</span></p> <p><a href="https://www.404media.co/theres-a-lootbox-with-rare-pokemon-cards-sitting-in-the-pentagon-food-court/?ref=aftermath.site"><i><span>404 Media</span></i></a><span> reports that the Lucky Box vending machine, which is essentially a gacha machine for rare, graded cards of both the sports and trading card game variety, was seemingly put up in the United States’ military headquarters </span><a href="https://taskandpurpose.com/news/pentagon-lucky-box/?ref=404media.co"><span>around Christmas Eve last month</span></a><span>.&nbsp;</span></p>

   <figure id="attachment_2000661404" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000661404"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000661404">© The Pokémon Company</figcaption></figure> <p><span>In a now-deleted Threads announcement, Lucky Box posted that it had set up one of its loot box machines in the Pentagon food court, and&nbsp; among the potential prizes which the machine’s display touts could be yours if you blindly give it some cash is the aforementioned Pikachu card. Based on photos posted on the </span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/army/comments/1qbc0du/comment/nz9gcjz/?ref=404media.co"><span>Army subreddit</span></a><span>, the machine also has an image of a giant Charizard card on the side of it, but it’s unclear if that’s just decoration or if the original fire-breathing dragon card is also in that specific machine. Taking your chances at a Luck Box machine can cost anywhere from $100 to $200.</span></p> <p><span>Lucky Box’s </span><a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/DSf3_KvCWta/"><span>social media accounts</span></a><span> include photos of big winners, some of whom won rare </span><i><span>Pokémon </span></i><span>cards, while others won autographed jerseys from various sports teams. But it doesn’t look like they’ve posted anyone scoring something big in the middle of the Pentagon yet. In fact, most of its posts feature the boxes in Las Vegas, where </span><a href="https://luckyboxvending.com/pages/store-locator"><span>over 20 of the machines are found</span></a><span>. The winners that are featured are finding some pretty valuable </span><i><span>Pokémon </span></i><span>cards, though, from a rare Venusaur to the ancient Mew promo card from </span><i><span>Pokémon: The First Movie</span></i><span>’s theatrical run.</span></p>   <p><i><span>Pokémon </span></i><span>cards are already pretty much considered gambling by people who crack packs open by the dozens in the hopes of scoring a quick buck, but it’s still striking to see that concept&nbsp; demonstrated as blatantly as it is here, with valuable cards locked away in a machine that requires people to shell out hundreds of dollars for a small chance of scoring one.. Thank goodness the most powerful military in the world is keeping its eye on the machine until the lucky winner comes along. </span></p>

              <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/console-wars-are-over-ps5-xbox-forza-switch-2-sony-1851752956">The console wars ended a while ago</a>, in case you didn’t know. But if they were still raging on, a talented hardware modder in China created a device that would force a lasting peace. It’s a massive and very cleverly designed triangular box that contains an Xbox, PlayStation, and Switch 2. They all work and can be easily swapped between with the press of a button.</p> <p><a href="https://www.tomshardware.com/video-games/console-gaming/modder-builds-all-in-one-console-with-ps5-xbox-series-x-and-switch-2-in-a-single-system-ningtendo-pxbox-5-powered-by-a-shared-250w-power-supply-mounted-inside-a-lost-wax-chassis">As first spotted by <em>Tom’s Hardware</em>,</a> Chinese tech and computer expert <em>小宁子 XNZ&nbsp;</em><a href="https://youtu.be/FAIqzpbv9Xw">has created an all-in-one mega console</a> which she anointed the “Ningtendo PXBOX 5,” a name that just rolls right off the tongue. According to XNZ, the idea behind this wild device came from her wanting to play various console-exclusive games without having to get up and manually power on and off each machine to switch between them.</p>

  <p>The design of the monster machine is inspired by the <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/112025">2013 Apple Mac Pro, aka the one that looked like a trash can</a>. And while she didn’t use the actual innards of an old Mac, the inside of that strange computer was a triangular setup that ended up being the perfect design to house three disassembled gaming consoles. A fan at the bottom is then used to cool the consoles.</p> <p>But creating a triangular heatsink for that would be expensive, so XNZ used an ancient method known as lost-wax casting to create the high-end piece of tech. Essentially, you first create an object out of an easy-to-melt piece of material, like wax or plastic, and then coat it in a heat-resistant material. Then you heat the object and all the soft insides melt and you can pour molten metal inside, which hardens and cools into your desired shape. Nifty!</p>

 <p>The end product is an impressive device but it might not be the most practical. The power supply she used only allows one console at a time to play a game, though the others can idle in the background. A big button on top switches the HDMI input between the consoles. Probably easier and cheaper to just buy the consoles and an HDMI switcher with a remote, but that’s not nearly as cool as the Ningtendo PXBOX 5.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><span>The </span><i><span>Animal Crossing</span></i><span>-like cozy life sim </span><i><span>Heartopia </span></i><span>is one of the biggest new games on Steam this month. It’s also made with AI-generated content according to a new disclosure by the developers.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><i><span>Heartopia</span></i><span> is developer and publisher XD International’s answer to the question, “What if </span><i><span>Animal Crossing</span></i><span> was a chibi anime?” It dropped on January 17 following a wave of closed betas in both November and December 2025. Concurrent players peaked at over 35,000.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>Reviews have been mixed, though. It currently sits at only a 66 percent positive rating on Steam. And many of the negative responses from players on Valve’s platform are taking issue with the developer not disclosing their use of AI-generated artwork in </span><i><span>Heartopia.</span></i></p>

 <figure id="attachment_2000661397" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000661397"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000661397">Discord</figcaption></figure> <p><span>“This game contains Generative AI (used to generate the puzzles), which they didn’t disclose until the accusations of it surfaced,” writes user </span><a href="https://steamcommunity.com/id/paruisfree/recommended/4025700/"><span>parupa206</span></a><span>. The use of AI wasn’t made public until </span><a href="https://www.gamingbible.com/news/new-cosy-animal-crossing-gen-ai-053843-20260120"><i><span>GAMINGbible’s</span></i><span> Richard Breslin</span></a><span> emailed </span><i><span>Heartopia’s </span></i><span>UK PR team earlier this week. A statement from the developer appeared on Discord not that long after.</span></p> <p><span>“Monetization Content in Heartopia does not include AI-generated materials,” read part of the message to fans. “Should any AI-assisted content be used in the game in the future, it will be announced in advance. Marketing materials produced outside the game, including those created in collaboration with third-party suppliers, are not covered by the scope of this disclosure.”</span></p>

 <p><span>Since then, </span><i><span>Heartopia’s</span></i><span> Steam page has been updated to include a newly added “AI Generated Content Disclosure” section, which states that “AI is used in the puzzle gameplay to reinterpret and redraw in-game snapshot images” and that AI is also “used in in-game chat to help players understand different languages.”</span></p>

 <p><span>The devs have seemingly not apologized for not disclosing their use of AI-generated assets on Steam in any of the official </span><i><span>Heartopia </span></i><span>channels that I could find, and, given how </span><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZMFYb1_MWc"><span>blatantly obvious</span></a><span> its usage appears to be in its puzzle minigame, I’m not sure how they ever thought they’d get away with not disclosing this in the first place.</span></p>

            <guid>1411387</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Some of the most popular <em>Fortnite</em> custom content creators and studios are using young women in their ads, but not making it clear whether the woman made the map or is just a spokesperson. This is causing frustration among some female <em>Fortnite</em> creators trying to find success online with their own maps.</p> <p>User-generated content is becoming a bigger and bigger part of Epic’s online battle royale metaverse, <em>Fortnite</em>. Some popular maps have tens of thousands of players online at one time. Some user-created maps and modes can even <a href="https://kotaku.com/fortnite-only-up-steam-game-pc-uefn-epic-popular-1850615732">become more popular than <em>Fortnite’s</em> official modes.</a> And the creators and teams behind these maps can make a lot of money if one of their creations goes viral, thanks to Epic’s system for paying developers based on how long people play custom maps and how often they come back to them. Some creators are making millions of dollars from these maps.</p>

 <p>As you might expect, that amount of money floating around means there are people trying to gain any edge they can in the <em>Fortnite</em> clout economy, including misleading players about who is actually behind new user-generated content. <a href="https://gamesbeat.com/male-fortnite-creators-are-enlisting-young-women-to-market-their-maps-and-co-op-their-identities/">A new report from <em>GamesBeat</em></a> dives deep into the ongoing controversy around male <a href="https://fortnite.gg/creators"><em>Fortnite</em> creators</a> and large content studios primarily using young women in social videos and online posts without always disclosing how that woman is actually connected to the map or mode being advertised.</p> <p>Pandvil is one of the most followed and highest-earning <em>Fortnite</em> creators around. <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/DSHB2XbEXF2/?igsh=NTc4MTIwNjQ2YQ%3D%3D&amp;img_index=4">And if you look at some</a> <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/DSK2mtpjD1F/?hl=en">posts online,</a> you’d likely believe that Pandvil is a woman. There’s even a meme that references people discovering that the creator is a woman. However, that’s reportedly not the case. <em>GamesBeat</em> spoke to three individuals who have knowledge of the real-life creator’s identity and who claimed the woman seen in many of Pandvil’s videos isn’t the creator. Instead, she’s allegedly a social media manager employed by the creator’s studio, further blurring the lines between spokesperson and developer.</p>   <p>Pandvil seems to lean into the idea of him being a young woman, and he’s not alone. <em>GamesBeat</em> reports that <em>Fortnite</em> creators <a href="https://www.instagram.com/hivecr8/">Team Hive</a> and <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@unc.creative/video/7509941569529679126">UNC Creative</a> also post many videos online featuring women who aren’t the creators of the maps they’re promoting, though in Hive’s case, <a href="https://x.com/hivesisters/">they do openly employ women</a> who act as the studio’s social media and marketing team. And while women have been used to market products, including games, for a very long time, the parasocial nature of online creator spaces makes this different.</p>

 <p>If you’re just randomly scrolling through your feed and stumble upon one of these videos, you might assume the creator is the young woman in the video describing the new map or mode, not realizing she’s just a paid spokesperson or community manager. Other female island creators who spoke to <em>GamesBeat</em> shared frustrations and misgivings with this marketing strategy. They felt that it could hurt them financially by taking away possible media coverage and brand deals or siphoning away players.</p>

 <p>Mackenzie Bell, the co-founder of content studio <a href="https://www.instagram.com/fn_alliance/?hl=en">Alliance Studios</a>, didn’t blame creators for using women in ads, but instead wants Epic to improve the <em>Fortnite</em> creator ecosystem. “It’s less about calling out the individual creators or teams and more about addressing the overall systemic issues,” <a href="https://gamesbeat.com/male-fortnite-creators-are-enlisting-young-women-to-market-their-maps-and-co-op-their-identities/">Bell told <em>GamesBeat</em></a>. “If the platform and the creator economy balance itself better, with stronger discovery tools, more equitable payouts and support for diverse voices, I think creators wouldn’t feel as pressured to lean into potentially misleading marketing just to survive.”</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Nintendo Might Have To Raise The Price Of The Switch 2 At The Worst Time]]></title>
            <link>https://kotaku.com/switch-2-price-increase-tariff-ai-ram-stock-price-2000661382</link>
            <guid>1411360</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><span>Nintendo may be about to “<a href="https://kotaku.com/ps5-gta-6-price-switch-2-trump-tariff-2000618881">follow in Sony and Microsoft’s footsteps</a>” and announce a Switch 2 price hike, according to a report from video game consumer insights firm Niko Partners. Although the new system is currently outselling the original Nintendo Switch by a wide margin in its first year, spiking RAM costs and ongoing tariffs could change all that.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>Niko Partners notes <a href="https://nikopartners.com/niko-partners-2026-predictions/">in a recent report</a> (</span><a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/nintendo-switch-2-faces-a-price-increase-in-2026-research-firm-predicts/"><span>via VGC</span><span>)</span></a><span> that</span> <span>Nintendo opted “to maintain [the Nintendo Switch 2’s] $449 entry price” when the system launched in June 2025, even as a trade war between the U.S. and China fueled price hikes on its competition. It now expects Nintendo to have to match those increases in 2026 due to high import taxes, increased memory costs, and other market conditions. <a href="https://gizmodo.com/amazon-ceo-says-tariff-price-increases-likely-to-hit-your-wallet-this-year-2000712020">Even Amazon’s CEO is warning</a>&nbsp;that this is the year companies start passing on more of the pain of tariffs to consumers.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><span>Nintendo President Shuntaro Furukawa </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/switch-2-price-hike-nintendo-sale-discount-2000642086"><span>previously told investors last November</span></a><span> that the company could keep the Switch 2 at $450 and “maintain the current level of profitability for hardware for the time being unless there are significant changes in external factors.” That time may have now passed. </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/switch-2-price-increase-nintendo-ram-shortage-2000658946"><span>Earlier this year</span></a><span>, he said the company was monitoring the current RAM situation and didn’t commit to not raising the price in the near future.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>These rumblings continue to suggest that anyone thinking of buying a Switch 2 in the next year might be better off doing it sooner rather than later, though Niko Partners notes that Nintendo might just start exclusively selling the $500 Switch 2 bundle rather than raising the price of the standalone SKU. In the meantime, the second half of the device’s launch year has been decidedly more uneven than the first.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><span>Despite having the </span><a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/whatsnew/nintendo-switch-2-sets-record-selling-over-3-5-million-units-globally-in-first-four-days/"><span>fastest sales of any Nintendo console ever</span></a><span>, and </span><a href="https://bsky.app/profile/pierre485.bsky.social/post/3mbwj5lp24s2o"><span>currently outselling</span></a><span> the original Nintendo Switch in Japan by almost 2:1 in its first 30 weeks on the market, Nintendo’s stock has been tanking. </span><span>Switch 2 Christmas hardware sales were reportedly </span><a href="https://www.thegamebusiness.com/p/nintendo-switch-2-sales-stumble-over"><span>down by 35 percent</span></a><span> compared to hardware sales in 2017 (the Nintendo Switch’s release year). Hardware sales numbers might be strong overall, but </span><a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2025-11-11/nintendo-s-software-sales-aren-t-keeping-up-with-hardware-boom"><i><span>Bloomberg </span></i><span>reported</span></a><span> that game sales and attach rates were actually down compared to the first Switch’s debut.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><span>Meanwhile, Nintendo’s stock price has dipped </span><a href="https://www.tipranks.com/news/the-fly/game-on-nintendo-stock-drops-in-japan-over-past-five-months-thefly"><span>by a whopping 23.45 percent</span></a><span> over the last three months. With pressure mounting from the AI-driven RAM shortages and a weird holiday season for the Switch 2, Nintendo is in the awkward position of needing to maintain the existing launch-window sales momentum while also being expected to increase the hardware’s price tag. The only thing that could square that circle is a new </span><i><span>3D Mario</span></i><span> or </span><i><span>Zelda </span></i><span>adventure, but neither of those have been officially announced yet. </span></p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/forza-horizon-5-backlog-pulse-music-ps5-xbox-2000661365</link>
            <guid>1411345</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><span>2012’s </span><i><span>Forza Horizon </span></i><span>is one of my lifetime favorites. Earlier games like </span><i><span>Grand Theft Auto 3 </span></i><span>had shown me how much I could enjoy the simple experience of driving around a game’s world with a great song on the radio, but </span><i><span>Horizon </span></i><span>took it to the next level with its gorgeous Colorado setting, its impeccable driving model, and the relentless stream of exceptional pop tunes on Horizon Pulse, the game’s best radio station.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>And yet, despite loving the original, I’ve been largely uninterested in its many sequels. Whenever a new one has landed, I’ve spent a bit of time with it and then walked away, feeling like each one was a solid game but also just more </span><i><span>Horizon</span></i><span>, and that wasn’t enough to pull me back. </span><i><span>Forza Horizon 5 </span></i><span>came the closest, with its inviting slice of Mexico just calling out to be explored, but even then, cruising around an open world didn’t feel like an experience I needed to return to in 2021.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><span>And so the series has languished on my backlog, with me thinking that maybe someday I might find a reason to truly dive back in and rediscover the spark that made me fall in love with the original. At last, that time has come: I’m playing and enjoying </span><i><span>Forza Horizon 5 </span></i><span>every day, and the experience has taught me to think about my backlog in a different way. Rather than viewing it as a list of games that I really want to push myself to play and complete as soon as the opportunity arises, I’m coming to accept the idea that with some games, you just have to be in the right mindset. Maybe a game’s time will come and maybe it won’t, but you shouldn’t try to force it.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>Right now, my life feels like a game that mostly takes place in corridors. I get up in the morning, I walk down the same familiar streets to the same train line that takes the same route into the city each day, and at night, I make the same trip back home. Of course I’m aware that there’s a whole world beyond the confines of the narrow pathway I follow day in and day out, but the routine of my days remains pretty rigid. The constant barrage of political horrors and acts of evil, alongside the global embarrassments that come from having a raving lunatic as your president, only exacerbate the feeling that I need to escape, hit the open road without destination or obligation and focus more on the gorgeous scenery around me than I do on whatever nightmares are unfolding in the news and on my social media feeds.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <figure id="attachment_2000661368" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000661368"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000661368">When you’re playing an Xbox game on a PlayStation console, only one customized license plate will do.</figcaption></figure> <p><span>I bought </span><i><span>Forza Horizon 5 </span></i><span>on PlayStation 5 as part of the recent winter sale, not long after the news had broken that we’d attacked Venezuela. I’ve stress-eaten pints of ice cream before but this was, I think, my first time ever stress-buying a video game. I just wanted to be someplace else. Not fighting my way through the hostile world of some combat-heavy video game but someplace gorgeous and welcoming, where I was free to go anywhere and the scenery was full of rejuvenating natural beauty. And that’s exactly what </span><i><span>Forza Horizon 5 </span></i><span>is giving me.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><span>It’s probably not going to become lodged into my consciousness the way the first game did, both because the experience felt fresh and new back in 2012 and because </span><a href="https://youtu.be/RhJJjbLzfuk?si=PzZiYatJmI35xdav"><span>the original’s Horizon Pulse is still undefeated</span></a><span>, its shimmery pop bangers becoming fused with my sense memory of cruising around Colorado. There’s some decent tunes in </span><i><span>Horizon 5</span></i><span> but nothing that’s making the pilgrimage over to my own personal playlists the way so many songs from the original did.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>And yet, don’t get me wrong, I’m having a great time with </span><i><span>Horizon 5</span></i><span>. The racing in it is excellent, of course, but I actually bought a fairly ordinary car, a Nissan Skyline, so I could do my favorite thing: just drive around at a reasonable speed and take in the scenery. Sometimes when I’m on the subway on my way home from work, I close my eyes and see the game’s world, with those vast, breathtaking skies, already calling to me. And yes, of course getting home and diving into </span><i><span>Forza Horizon 5</span></i><span> is just me replacing one screen with another. I know that. But the screen that lets me escape into that gorgeous Mexican landscape isn’t going to fry my brain with a litany of all the latest horrors. It’s going to let me forget all that for a little while, savor the pleasure of hitting the open road, and remember why I think this world is worth fighting for.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><span>It’s also helping me make peace with my backlog. For years, games like </span><i><span>Returnal </span></i><span>and the </span><i><span>Demon’s Souls </span></i><span>remake have sat there, waiting patiently for my attention, and yet tackling them has just never felt right. I have little doubt that if and when I do play them, I’ll find a great deal to admire and I may even fall in love with them and wonder what took me so long, but I’ve just never yet felt them calling to me. Sometimes I’ve felt bad for not forcing myself to play them, telling myself that maybe if I just push myself over the initial hump of my indifference, everything would click and I’d be glad that I dove in.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>Maybe I would, but now I feel like maybe it’s okay to let go of that pressure, and to tell myself that if there comes a time in my life when </span><i><span>Returnal </span></i><span>is the game I need to play, the right game for where my mind and my heart are at in that moment, I’ll know it. For now, I have to go drive a car into a sandstorm.</span></p>

              <p><span>While ex-BioWare producer Mark Darrah </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/anthem-single-player-offline-mode-bioware-ea-mark-darrah-2000659773"><span>made a whole pitch</span></a><span> about how EA could still salvage </span><i><span>Anthem </span></i><span>for relatively cheap, it does seem more likely that BioWare and its parent company are going to let the game </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/anthem-server-shutdown-final-hours-videos-clips-stream-2000659367"><span>die a meaningless death</span></a><span>. However, some fans are looking into how the game could remain playable despite the servers being shut down, and one person has already managed to get it running on a P2P server.</span></p> <p><span>YouTuber And799 has posted a video of the game running on local servers. Though some of the online features, such as looking at your online profile, didn’t work, And799 was able to get the game running with two players in the same matchmaking space. According to the video description, this is all just for “research” and an “experiment,” and shouldn’t be considered indicative of any kind of </span><i><span>Anthem </span></i><span>revival process. However, it is exciting to see that a playable version of the game is still possible, even if EA and BioWare aren’t helming it themselves.</span></p>

  <p><span>If that’s already possible mere days after </span><i><span>Anthem </span></i><span>was shut down on January 12, hopefully fan efforts to preserve the game bear fruit in the coming months. Even if you </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/anthem-server-shutdown-bioware-dragon-age-mass-effect-1851786136"><span>didn’t like </span><i><span>Anthem </span></i></a><span>or thought BioWare </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/anthem-bioware-mark-darrah-interview-rpg-shutdown-2000661337"><span>shouldn’t have made it</span></a><span>, a game shouldn’t disappear without a trace afterpeople paid money for it and hundreds of developers spent years working on it. Fans may get the game’s unfinished campaign back up and running, but it’s unclear how much of the online experience they’ll be able to rebuild.</span></p> <p><i><span>Anthem</span></i><span>’s shutdown comes about a year after </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/dragon-age-the-veilguard-bioware-layoffs-mass-effect-1851784416"><span>BioWare was subject to significant downsizing</span></a><span> following the launch of </span><i><span>Dragon Age: The Veilguard</span></i><span>, with remaining developers all working on the next </span><i><span>Mass Effect</span></i><span>. The studio put out a </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/mass-effect-5-n7-day-bioware-blog-teaser-url-krogan-2000642122"><span>small tease for the game on N7 Day last year</span></a><span>, but was completely silent when </span><i><span>Dragon Age</span></i><span>’s equivalent fan day </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/dragon-age-the-veilguard-day-bioware-layoffs-december-4-2000650888"><span>came and went in December</span></a><span>.</span></p>

              <p><em>The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt</em> is a fantastic single-player open-world RPG. One of the best ever made. And yet the incredibly detailed and lively world of the game would make for the perfect place to hang out with some friends. And thanks to a new mod, that dream can now be made real on PC.</p> <p><a href="https://www.polygon.com/witcher-3-online-multiplayer-mod/">As spotted by <em>Polygon</em></a>, <em>Witcher Online</em> is a new free mod for the PC version of <em>The Witcher 3</em> that adds online multiplayer for up to five players. <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/witcher3/mods/11590">The mod launched earlier this month and is available now on <em>Nexus Mods</em></a> and was created by user Rejuvenate. Here’s a trailer for the mod, which shows off what’s possible when five Geralts are hanging out together:</p>

  <p>To play <em>Witcher Online</em>, you’ll need to download and install the mod and own a “non-pirated”&nbsp;PC copy of the latest version of <em>The Witcher 3</em> from either Steam or GOG.</p> <p>The mod lets players customize their Geralt or use custom player characters while hanging out online. Folks can also relax and chill in the game’s various taverns using a separate <em>Witcher 3</em> mod, Chill Out, which is fully supported by <em>Witcher Online</em>. You and a few friends can play through all of <em>The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt</em> using this mod. However, <a href="https://rejuvenate.gitbook.io/witcheronline/general-information/playguide#:~:text=Other%20players%20cannot%20help%20you%20fight%20monsters%2C%20solve%20puzzles%2C%20or%20complete%20objectives.%20Because%20of%20this%2C%20you%20each%20must%20try%20to%20complete%20objectives%20at%20the%20same%20time%20as%20each%20other%20throughout%20the%20storyline.">there are a few caveats.</a> While the mod does sync all character animations, equipment, and combat across multiple players, you won’t be able to help other players fight monsters or complete quests, so the mod creator recommends you quest together and all “try to complete objectives at the same time as each other throughout the storyline.”</p>

 <p>But really, while you can go out and complete quests, <em>Witcher Online</em> seems more like a mod designed to let friends hang out in <em>The</em> <em>Witcher 3</em>‘s fantasy world and just enjoy the vibes while causing some random chaos or mayhem. And because this mod is free to access, I don’t think developers CDPR are going to go after it like the company <a href="https://kotaku.com/cyberpunk-2077-vr-mod-baldurs-gate-3-takedown-2000660987">recently did with a<em> Cyberpunk 2077</em> VR mod</a>.</p>
