In the suit he called Bungie’s investigation a “sham,” denied committing any fireable offenses, and suggested that Sony terminated his job as part of a ploy to deny him more than $40 million that he otherwise would have been paid due to Sony buying Bungie in 2022.

Sony’s lawyers say that these messages show a “pattern of misconduct.” The document was filed last week, according to <em>Game File. </em></p><p>In one message  Barrett asks a female Bungie employee, “Are you still in PJs?” and “[I]s it like a button down top and bottoms? Sweatpants? Lulu lemons?”</p><p>In another message, Barrett called a woman the “Holy Grail” and added:</p><blockquote data-type="BlockQuote"><p>I’m not hitting on you. I hope it doesn’t feel like that. I’m married. But I can be honest. You are the .000001 and better be treated like that forever.</p></blockquote><p>The woman replied that her boyfriend treats her “very well” and the former Bungie director replied: “He better cuz I would hit on you if he wasn’t.”</p><p>A different woman working at Bungie claims Barrett called her while drunk late at night and spent hours with her on FaceTime, despite the female employee asking him to respect her boundaries. At one point he allegedly took his phone into his bedroom and said, “I can’t believe I am lying in bed talking to [VICTIM 1].” She abruptly hung up. </p><p>Barrett’s lawyer sent this statement over to <em>Game File: </em></p><blockquote data-type="BlockQuote"><p>Sony continues to disingenuously cherry pick text messages and alleged conversations and make unsupported and conclusory statements to defame Christopher and justify terminating him to avoid paying him what he was owed under his employment agreements. It is telling that Sony does not include the full text messages as exhibits, or the full content of these conversations, and nothing in Sony’s response provides a legitimate legal or factual basis to terminate Christopher for cause.</p></blockquote><p>“Christopher is confident that when all the evidence is presented, it will be clear that Sony engaged in a scheme to strip him of his role and the equity awards he earned for his 25 years of loyal service to the company,” said Barrett’s lawyer. </p><p> .<br></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Each contains a new tagline for the season, “Every path has a price,” referencing that each of these characters will make (or has already made) a violent decision that will have ramifications beyond what any of them realizes in the moment. For Joel, we saw the decision he made at the end of the first season to save Ellie from her fate at the hands of the Fireflies. As for the two young women, we’ll watch that play out over the course of the next season.</p><p>Another interesting detail is that each poster has its respective character walking on an item that reflects a key part of their character. Joel walks on top of the broken watch gifted to him by his daughter Sarah at the beginning of the outbreak, Ellie stands on the guitar Joel will likely give her in the first episode of season two, and Abby is shown on top of a Firefly pendant. It seems like the show isn’t playing coy with Abby’s identity, which is a departure from the video game this season is based on, <em>The Last of Us Part II</em>, which kept her role as an ex-Firefly secret until midway through the game.</p><p>The first season of <em>The Last of Us </em>was a pretty faithful retelling of the 2013 game’s story, though there were <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/last-of-us-hbo-bill-frank-gay-nick-offerman-bartlett-1850035741&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/last-of-us-hbo-bill-frank-gay-nick-offerman-bartlett-1850035741">a few notable changes</a></span> throughout. Some of the scenes shown in the trailers for season two imply the show may play with the game’s flashback-heavy structure, but we won’t know for sure until the series comes back on April 13.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
