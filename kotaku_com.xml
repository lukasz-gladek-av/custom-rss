            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>If you’ve been looking for a way to share your Formula 1 enthusiasm with your kids while keeping them entertained with quality building toys, LEGO has created exactly what you need. The <strong>LEGO F1 collectible race cars pack</strong> brings the excitement of the racing circuit straight to your living room and right now, Amazon is offering this set at a record low price during Prime Big Deal Days: <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4535/">Down from $30 to just $20, this mystery box collection has climbed into the top 10 best-selling LEGO sets</a> on the site.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4535/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Twelve Teams, Virtually Limitless Possibilities</h2>
<p>The allure of this set is its mystery box structure: <strong>Six randomly picked mini F1 race cars out of a total of 12 varying models</strong> are received, which makes for a different combination with each purchase. The available roster consists of <strong>RB20, Mercedes-AMG, Ferrari, McLaren, Aston Martin, Alpine, Williams, VCARB, Sauber, Haas, a generic F1, and an F1 Academy car</strong>. Each model is incredibly small (being a few inches in length) which makes them ideal for little hands to hold on to and operate for creative race scenarios. The<strong> randomness provides for a surprise that children dearly enjoy</strong>&nbsp;and creates a fuss around the unboxing alone as children see which teams ended up in their individual collection.</p>



<p>LEGO did not skimp on details here: Each car comes decorated in <strong>genuine team colors with actual team logos emblazoned</strong> directly onto the bodywork so that young supporters will have the opportunity to recognize their favored teams at a glance. A <strong>team helmet occupying each cockpit</strong> adds another note of realism which F1-fixated youngsters will love.</p>
<p>The wheels spin smoothly, too, which makes these from passive display pieces into dynamic racing toys. Children can push them around the floor, prepare racing grids on the table top, or devise elaborate race scenarios pitting disparate teams against one another for the championship crown. At a total of 174 pieces divided between six cars, individual assemblies, which take between 10-15 minutes, remain small enough for little ones but still encounter enough challenge to be satisfying.</p>



<p>They’re compact enough that you can toss a few into a purse for restaurant waits, road trips, or flights when you’d like something to amuse kids without wasting valuable luggage space. They’re ideal birthday party favors when you’re hosting a racing-themed party, too. Instead of gaudy-cheap pieces of plastic that snap off after a few hours, guests depart with actual LEGO constructions they’ll be able to use repeatedly and treasure.</p>
<p>At $20 for a six-car pack, you’re out about $3.33 per model, which is extremely cheap considering each one is a complete buildable set complete with actual F1 branding. Because there are 12 distinct cars overall, acquiring two 6-packs provides a good likelihood of assembling a majority or all of the released models. As built, the little racers look great lining a shelf in your child’s bedroom, on a starting grid layout, or assembled into team alliances.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/this-tp-link-wifi-7-router-is-300-off-now-selling-for-pennies-if-youre-a-prime-member-2000631994</link>

              <p>Amazon has formally rolled out <strong>Prime Big Deal Day</strong>&nbsp;which makes tens of thousands of special deals available for Prime members alone. This is one of the primary membership perks: you get sale prices at all-time lows on hottest items across the board. If you have been waiting for a Wi-Fi 7 router from a world-class manufacturer, this is the deal that you simply cannot pass up.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4520/">TP-Link Archer BE800 has gone on sale at $299 (original $599), which is a stunning 50% off one of the best routers available</a> on the market today. This tri-band giant solves the growing problem of bandwidth saturation common in homes nowadays where dozens of devices compete for connectivity, phones, laptops, smart TV and gaming devices being some examples.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4520/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>WiFi 7 Technology That Redefines Your Network</h2>
<p>The Archer BE800 takes Wi-Fi 7’s revolutionary capabilities and combines them<strong> for a total of 19 Gbps across three bands</strong>: 11,520 Mbps on the 6 GHz band, 5,760 Mbps on the 5 GHz band, and 1,376 Mbps on the 2.4 GHz band. These translate to real-world performance that <strong>handles several 4K and 8K streams at once</strong> without buffering, supports VR-AR gaming without lag and keeps video calls going smoothly even when other members of the household are downloading large files.</p>



<p>The 320 MHz channel bandwidth doubles the pipe compared to Wi-Fi 6’s highest 160 MHz channels and allows for more information at once. Combined with 4K-QAM modulation which encodes more information per transmission, the router provides much better throughput compared to previous generations. Multi-RU functions allow the router to support many devices at once on the same channel without creating the bottlenecks that occur when many devices contend for attention.</p>
<p>The physical connectivity choices are just as solid: <strong>Two 10 Gbps ports support future-proofed wired connections</strong> for high-end users such as NAS setups, desktop workstations, or ISP connections above the standard gigabit rates. One is a combo SFP+ fiber and RJ45 port and allows flexibility should you have your fiber broadband setup or wish to upgrade at a future date. The remaining four 2.5 Gbps ports support devices requiring faster-than-gigabit speeds but not necessarily the full 10 Gbps, such as Wi-Fi 6E access points or high-performance gaming PCs. A USB 3.0 port exists for network-attached storage or shared printing throughout your network.</p>



<p>The <strong>eight strategically mounted antennas</strong> operate with beamforming tech which emits the wireless signal straight at devices instead of broadcasting it omni-directionally. That directional method provides range extension along with stability of connections and shows a particular advantage for large homes or homes on interference hotspots.</p>
<p>TP-Link’s HomeShield security suite includes network scanning, IoT device identification, parental controls, and quality of service management in the free tier. The separate IoT network feature lets you isolate smart home devices on their own protected Wi-Fi network, preventing potential security vulnerabilities in cheap smart bulbs or cameras from compromising your main network. EasyMesh compatibility means you can expand coverage by adding compatible TP-Link extenders that create seamless roaming throughout your home.</p>
<p>For $299 on Prime Big Deal Day, you’re getting enterprise-class networking tech that will last your home networking needs for years into the future.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/bye-bye-bose-airpods-max-are-selling-for-peanuts-on-amazon-right-now-2000631785</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>When Prime Day rolls around at Amazon, even Apple gets on board with their biggest deals of the year. It’s no coincidence that the last time Apple offered the AirPods Max, their premium over-ear headphones, for only $429 was during the last Prime Day event back in July. But Prime Day’s back, <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4532/">and so are the $429 AirPods Max (down from $549)</a>.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4532/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>
<p>This <strong>21% deal is big stuff for Apple</strong>, especially for their top-of-the-line wireless headphones. And the one tried and true fact about Apple is, you get what you pay for – their tech goods might run higher in price than much of the competition, but the performance backs up every penny of it. The AirPods Max are just another bit of proof.</p>

<h2>Amazing Engineering</h2>
<p>The <strong>Apple H1 chip is the secret sauce</strong> that makes the AirPods Max just that much better than much of their competition. There’s also the dynamic driver that tracks your head position in real time, instantly adjusts the sound, and all the while intelligently optimizes the output after analyzing your unique ear shape. It’s very likely as close to a live listening experience as you can get from a pair of wireless headphones.</p>



<p>When it comes to the <strong>all-important noise cancellation performance</strong> — because, honestly, what good are headphones if the sound has to compete with the noise around you? — the AirPods Max are among the very best on the market. It’s active noise cancellation that adjusts on the fly and, if you like, can almost completely isolate you so all you hear is what you want to hear from your smartphone, tablet, or laptop. But you also have the ability to take control and switch the AirPods Max to transparency mode, allowing exterior sounds and conversations to be heard while still delivering primo sound.</p>



<h2>All-Day Comfort</h2>
<p><strong>An all-day battery life</strong> is pretty much useless without the ability to wear your headphones comfortably, and vice versa. Thankfully the <strong>robust 20-hour battery life</strong> of the AirPods Max is backed by exceptional comfort with the lightweight AirPods Max sporting a knit-mesh canopy band that is breathable yet holds the phones firmly in place, and memory foam ear cushions that form a perfect seal over your ears for optimal sound, but also optimal comfort.</p>
<p>There’s certainly no guarantee that Apple will drop the price of the AirPods Max as low as $429 again come Black Friday or during Cyber Week, and do you really want to wait for the next Prime Day event in 2026 to score a pair of pro-level wireless headphones? This Prime Day deal looks like a solid winner.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/apple-quietly-offloads-the-airpods-pro-2-now-rushing-to-clear-stock-to-welcome-the-next-gen-2000631989</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>The AirPods Pro 3 have just been released a few weeks ago (check out <a href="https://gizmodo.com/airpods-pro-3-review-skating-to-where-the-puck-is-going-not-where-it-has-been-2000658726">Gizmodo’s review here</a>), but here is a fact: the improvements from them to the AirPods Pro 2 are negligible but the price difference is rather high. Amazon is clearing out its stock for <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4044/">the AirPods Pro 2 at a new all-time-low price of $169 (previously $249), but you can have them at that price until stocks last</a>. This is the best deal available, and there is no logical reason you should pay a dime more for the AirPods Pro 3 when the second-generation ones have nearly the same experience at a much lower price.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4044/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Our Favorite AirPods Pro 2</h2>
<p>The H2 chip is a major increase in processing power over the original AirPods Pro. This proprietary <strong>Apple silicon allows for Active Noise Cancellation that eliminates up to twice as much background noise as the original</strong>, and creates a great isolation bubble even on busy trains or noisy city streets. The low-distortion driver, paired with the H2 chip, produces clear high-end frequencies and robust bass and gives audio fidelity on par with Dedicated audiophile earbuds. Voice Isolation significantly enhances call quality through the use of computational audio and isolates your voice from background noise so your colleagues or friends hear you distinctly even when you’re calling from noisy environments.</p>
<p>The Adaptive Audio mode needs a special mention here because it automatically combines Active Noise Cancellation or Transparency mode according to what you’re experiencing around you. As you don’t have to choose between modes, you don’t have to constantly flip between them which is a common complaint amongst older wireless earbuds.</p>



<p>Conversation Awareness takes it a step further, automatically recognizing when you initiate a conversation with someone close to you and automatically reduces audio volume while increasing voices, then automatically switches back when the talk ends. These intelligent features eliminate the need for continual adjusting of controls, a common complaint with older wireless earbuds.</p>
<p><strong>Personalized Spatial Audio produces a three-dimensional soundstage</strong> through custom audio calibration based on a measure of your individual ear shape using the iPhone camera, along with dynamic head tracking. This tech makes audio from music and films sound like it is occurring at you, not inside your head. The trick is highly effective on Dolby Atmos content, creating a true immersion that changes the way you experience media on your devices.</p>



<p>The AirPods Pro 2 introduced something fantastic: a <strong>complete hearing health ecosystem that goes beyond standard earbuds</strong>. The scientifically validated Hearing Test walks you through a clinical-grade assessment right from your iPhone which measures your hearing sensitivity across different frequencies to create a personalized audio profile. This isn’t just a gimmick; it’s genuine hearing science packed into consumer tech. The clinical-grade Hearing Aid feature then amplifies environmental sounds and conversations in real time for people with mild to moderate hearing loss, essentially functioning as an FDA-authorized over-the-counter hearing aid.</p>
<p><strong>The IP54 rating means both the earbuds</strong>, and the MagSafe charging case are dust-, sweat-, and water-resistant against splashes. Wear them on exercise, light rain, or dusty events without a second thought. <strong>Four sizes of silicone tip</strong> ensure the proper fit for different ear shapes, a must for both comfort for being worn for a long period of time and for the acoustic seal needed for good noise cancellation.</p>
<p>Make sure you don’t miss that deal, it might run out of stock soon.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[JBL Quietly Offloads the Waterproof Flip 5 Speaker, Now Listed for Pennies on Amazon]]></title>
            <link>https://kotaku.com/jbl-quietly-offloads-the-waterproof-flip-5-speaker-now-listed-for-pennies-on-amazon-2000631979</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/jbl-quietly-offloads-the-waterproof-flip-5-speaker-now-listed-for-pennies-on-amazon.1317370/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Portable Bluetooth speakers aren’t just summer essentials for beach trips and backyard barbecues. As winter settles in, these compact powerhouses become your soundtrack for cozy indoor gatherings, holiday dinner parties where you want music flowing through every room or even those brave souls who enjoy winter hiking and need motivation on snowy trails.</p>
<p>JBL has built an incredible reputation in the audio world, and <strong>their Flip 5 remains our favorite pick in the portable speaker category</strong> for its balance of sound quality, durability, and portability. For Prime Big Deal Day,<a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4518/"> this bestseller has dropped to a new record low price of $89 (down from $99)</a>, which makes it an ideal time to grab one before the holiday season kicks into full gear.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4518/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Strengths and Ability That Translate into Something Tangible</h2>
<p>The <strong>Flip 5 has 20 watts of output power</strong> housed within its cylindrical body, so you’re getting true room-filling sound instead of cheap portable speaker sound that is often tinny. That 20 watts adds up to clear vocals and surprising deep bass for a portable speaker of its compact nature and enables it, for instance, to deliver acoustic sessions or thumping electronic beats without distortion at loud volumes.</p>
<p>The frequency response goes all the way up to 20 kHz which is the entire range of the human ear so you experience every nuance of sound within your tunes, from the bright ring of cymbals to the throb of the bass guitar. JBL’s distinct sound signature is on clarity and punch which makes for a dynamic listening experience that makes people want to get up on their feet instead of simply filling the background with noise.</p>



<p>The <strong>IPX7 water resistance rating warrants special attention</strong> due to its extension beyond splashing resistance. This rating signifies that the speaker is capable of being submerged for 30 minutes within a span of up to three feet of water without being compromised or malfunctioning at all. In practice, you don’t have to be concerned about using it poolside, take it inside the shower for your morning regimen, or have it playing at some impromptu rain shower at a live event outdoors.</p>



<p><strong>Battery life is 12 hours on a single charge</strong> which is sufficient for the majority of day-long activities without scrambling for a plug outlet. This battery life is based on moderate volume usage, so turning the sound up full blast will reduce the battery life, but for routine home or camp usage, you should have several playback sessions prior to needing a recharge. The speaker is <strong>charged through a USB-C,</strong> which is fast becoming the standard across devices, so you should be able to share the charging cable with charging your smartphone or tablet.</p>
<p>The PartyBoost functionality opens up creative uses by enabling you to <strong>wire up a number of Flip 5 speakers wirelessly for stereo or extra volume</strong>. This works flawlessly with other PartyBoost-enabled JBL speakers and creates a cohesive sound experience between a number of rooms or expanding the coverage area for a broader gathering.</p>
<p>For $89, you’re getting dependable JBL engineering that has garnered <strong>more than 82,000 customer reviews with a 4.8-star average</strong>. For anyone assembling their audio collection or upgrading a worn-out speaker, this Prime Big Deal Day deal amounts to good value on a tried-and-true performer that takes daily usage in stride.</p>

              <p>Over the last year, two trading card games have received levels of attention never seen before in their decades-long histories. Both&nbsp;<em>Pokémon</em> and&nbsp;<em>Magic: The Gathering</em> have become more popular than ever, with both franchises selling out of new product so routinely that it’s become normal to not be able to find any packs in any stores. Rather than attempting to ramp up production to meet these additional demands, both companies appear to be leaning in, encouraging the scarcity with ever-more-desirable and underproduced sets, for significant short-term gains. However, I contend this focus on the frenzy has a massive cost: the regular players. And when a generation of kids simply cannot buy the cards they need to build a deck, the long-term losses could be brutal.</p> <p>If you’ve got some disposable income and are a collector of pretty cardboard, times are great. Those able to afford scalpers’ fees or the booming secondhand market can pick up some all-time best-looking cards in both series, with <em>Pokémon’s</em> ever-more-beautiful full-art cards routinely fetching $500 in resales and <em>Magic</em>‘s waterfall of tie-in expansion sets from some of the most popular properties in entertainment selling out before most people even learn they’re on sale. You know who this isn’t helping? People who actually play <em>Pokémon TCG</em> or&nbsp;<em>Magic: The Gathering</em>.</p>

 <p>Right now, where I live in the UK, the only way I can get a pack of <em>Pokémon&nbsp;</em>cards released in the last 12 months is by <a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-tcg-mega-evolution-pull-rates-2000629165">making it my job to write about them</a> and having them sent to me directly by The Pokémon Company. This is clearly not a path open to all. At the same time, I routinely pop into both specialist card stores and larger retailers to see if I can get anything from November 2024’s Surging Sparks onward, let alone the most recent sets, and usually find they have nothing at all. In the last week I’ve noticed justifiably unloved Temporal Forces packs from March ’24 showing up here and there, and that’s my lot. If I wanted to be playing in live games with the current meta, I’d now have to resort to buying even bulk cards from resellers.</p>

 <p>Meanwhile, over at Wizards of the Coast’s&nbsp;<em>Magic: The Gathering</em>, <a href="https://kotaku.com/magic-gathering-mtg-universes-beyond-lotr-reprints-1851664815">it’s no better</a>. Where once the game would release occasional spin-off sets based on other media properties for a fun treat, the card game is now dominated by an ever-growing number of “legal” cards from other universes, not least the&nbsp;<em>Final Fantasy</em> sets. And boy oh boy, <a href="https://kotaku.com/final-fantasy-x-secret-lair-mtg-sold-out-ebay-reprint-1851784230">they’ve been a scalper’s paradise</a> too. Then there was <a href="https://kotaku.com/sonic-magic-gathering-secret-lair-card-pre-order-drop-1851786245">July’s Sonic-themed debacle</a>, as well as the impossibility of finding <em>Lord of the Rings</em> packs. This is only going to get weirder, <a href="https://magic.wizards.com/en/news/announcements/aligning-the-universes-making-all-our-sets-legal-in-all-our-formats">now that Universes Beyond sets will be legal in all Constructed formats</a>. This is going to include such exceptionally un-<em>Magic</em> licenses as <em>Spider-Man</em>,&nbsp;<a href="https://kotaku.com/magic-gathering-mtg-star-trek-marvel-avengers-2026-sets-2000629313"><em>Star Trek</em></a><a href="https://kotaku.com/magic-gathering-mtg-star-trek-marvel-avengers-2026-sets-2000629313"> and, er, Dwight from&nbsp;<em>The Office</em></a><a href="https://kotaku.com/magic-gathering-mtg-star-trek-marvel-avengers-2026-sets-2000629313">?</a> The result of this is obviously that the sets are attracting collectors over and above players, bringing in the people looking to pull the rarest, most interesting art to put in a binder. And good on ’em—I rarely play&nbsp;<em>Pokémon TCG</em> any more now that my kid’s lost interest, but I still love my binders. But there’s a consequence.</p>

 <p>I worry for the players. If you can’t just buy the packs, you can’t play the game. And given both companies appear to be not only doing nothing to improve the situation, but going out of their way to make it worse, this will surely have a long-term impact on the products in the future? Your adult collectors today were likely kids or teenagers playing in the past, and when those adults cut out the next generation of kids, that pipeline springs a very significant leak.</p>

 <figure id="attachment_2000632027" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000632027"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000632027">© The Pokémon Company / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p>In <em>Pokémon</em>‘s latest set, Mega Evolution, the company has chosen to include <a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-tcg-mega-evolution-gold-cards-pull-rate-2000630564">two cards so rare they only appear in one out of every 2,520 packs</a>, which of course is driving even more frenzied interest toward the cards when they’ve already been <a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-tcg-prismatic-evolutions-surging-sparks-sold-1851738920">close to impossible to buy for nearly a year</a>. Repeated <a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-tcg-cards-available-journey-together-stock-1851772771">promises from The Pokémon Company to increase production</a> either haven’t been honored or haven’t made a meaningful difference, and a move like this really underlines just how uninvested it is in making things any better. Meanwhile, Wizards of the Coast appears to be chasing the same results with its Secret Lair drops that sell out in minutes and leave so many people disappointed, with the company adding more spin-off sets this and next year than in multiple previous years combined.</p>

 <p>And yes, absolutely, these companies don’t care! If it’s a scalper or a five-year-old buying the products, the money fills up their bank just the same. But I suspect they <em>are</em> going to care when interest drops off considerably in the next five to ten years, after a generation who was cut off from being able to access the games reaches an age when they’ve got spending money. It’s what my friend Paul describes as “Funkopopping” their brands. They’re forgetting that all the little words written on those cards have a purpose beyond making the pictures harder to enjoy.</p> <p>Who knows, maybe time will prove me wrong, and both companies’ emphatic leaning on driving short-term buzz will work out for them, and I’ll look like a big old idiot. But I do suspect otherwise.&nbsp;<em>Pokémon</em>‘s <a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-scalper-reseller-trading-card-van-gogh-pikachu-1850925900">disappearance into a scalper-driven secondhand market</a> is a&nbsp;<em>terrible</em> look for the company, even if it pushes up their profits in the moment, while&nbsp;<em>MtG</em>‘s watering down of its own universe to become some&nbsp;<em>Fortnite</em>-like mash-up of contemporary culture seems like such a short-sighted cash-grab. And none of it benefits the group of misfit kids who find company and kindness in sitting around a table, playing the games. And that sucks.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Looking to boost your productivity without cluttering your desk or weighing down your backpack? A portable monitor opens up a world of possibilities: extend your laptop screen for seamless multitasking at the coffee shop, transform your phone into a mini workstation during travel, enjoy console gaming on a crisp display anywhere or catch up on movies during long commutes.</p>
<p>The beauty of these displays is that they take up less space than a standard notebook while doubling your screen real estate. Right now, <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4362/">the KYY 15.6-inch portable monitor has dropped to a new record low of $69 (down from $99) for Prime Big Deal Day on Amazon</a>, and the good news is that this deal is <strong>available to non-Prime</strong> members as well.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4362/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<p>This makes it one of the cheapest ways of adding a second monitor to your setup but what counts is what you’re getting for your money. The KYY monitor <strong>provides Full HD 1920×1080 resolution on a 15.6-inch IPS panel which means clear text and high-quality colors from almost any angle due to the 178-degree viewing angle</strong>. The IPS setup provides true color consistency even when you’re not looking directly at the monitor. The addition of HDR tech provides greater contrast and colour depth, creating more realistic images that make both work documents and entertainment media more interesting to watch.</p>
<p>The monitor includes <strong>blue light reduction tech and flicker-free backlight</strong> which helps reduce eye fatigue when sitting for prolonged periods or staying up for gaming sessions. The side menu control wheel gives fast toggling for brightness, contrast and color temp without digging through convoluted button combinations. The <strong>monitor allows both landscape and portrait modes</strong>, which allows it to be flexible for varying uses such as coding for instance.</p>



<h2>Premium features worth the extra cost</h2>
<p>The connectivity choices warrant a special mention since they dictate how easily you’ll be able to truly employ this monitor across your devices. The KYY features a couple of full-function <strong>USB-C ports</strong>&nbsp;which is a big plus point. This allows you to power the monitor and send video out of a single cable when plugged into laptops or phones sporting USB-C with video output (Thunderbolt 3 or USB 3.1). The real-world advantage here is getting rid of cable clutter and streamlining your portable setup. For devices that lack USB-C, there exists a <strong>Mini-HDMI port that guarantees backward support for older laptops</strong>, gaming consoles such as PS4 and Xbox and the Nintendo Switch.</p>



<p><strong>Thin and light at 0.3 inches thick and just 1.7 pounds</strong>, the monitor fits into a backpack without adding discernible bulk. The smart cover, which is included, has several uses: it protects the display from scratches when being carried around with its tough PU leather covering, magnetically attaches to the display for a frameless experience, and doubles into a stand with two rotating grooves for varying viewing angles. This makes carrying a separate stand or holding the monitor against some arbitrary object unnecessary. The dual stereo speakers built-in, along with a 3.5mm audio jack, make sound options available without needing external speakers, although the speakers are more geared towards casual usage than audiophile-quality sound.</p>
<p>For this all-time-low $69, you’re getting a full portable display solution with the<strong> Protective Cover and Screen Protector bundle included</strong>. For remote workers or gamers requiring portability for their setup, this bundle gives huge value for expanding your visual workplace.</p>

              <p>If you’re not already one of the hundreds of millions of people who own an Alexa speaker at home, then <em>Prime Big Deal Days</em> could be a good time to join the ride. Amazon has <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4514/">discounted its Echo Dot at a record-low $34, down from the usual $49</a> (and <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4515/">the Echo Pop to $24 from $39</a>), and there’s a reason this tiny speaker has become so popular: It removes that daily friction of foraging for your phone when setting timers when cooking, changing thermostats manually or searching for the correct playlist when your hands are full.</p>

<h2>Audio That Finally Keeps Up with the Convenience</h2>
<p>Earlier Echo Dots won their success on the strength of functionality over audio quality, but that changes with this new model: <strong>Amazon entirely rebuilt the internal audio design to produce tighter vocals, more robust bass response, and richer sound</strong> that fills a room rather than just crowding a corner. The speaker includes a new custom full-range driver that addresses high-end reproduction and low-end reproduction much more effectively than older, smaller drivers. That results in your morning news updates coming through with sharp clarity and music streaming through Spotify or Amazon Music with enough richness for casual enjoyment.</p>



<p>Integration with a smart home makes the <strong>Echo Dot a universal remote for your entire home</strong> for all your devices that are compatible. If you have bulbs, plugs, thermostats or cameras that are smart, voice commands replace physical switches or smartphone apps. The motion sensor and internal temperature sensor incorporate another form of automation with routines.</p>
<p>Several Echo devices per home allow whole-home audio so your music accompanies you wherever you go from kitchen through living room to bedroom. Pairing with Fire TV creates a home theater setup with playback managed by Alexa, searching for titles, and volume adjustment. Echo Dot also extends wifi coverage when paired with appropriate eero mesh wifi systems and does away with connectivity dead spots causing streaming stoppages and lost connections.</p>
<p><strong>Privacy features also include a physical off button for the mic that electronically disables the mics</strong>, and gives you complete control over when the unit is permitted to listen. The button glows red when the mics are disabled for obvious visual feedback. Amazon built some layers of privacy into the infrastructure, and the company does not sell your personal information to third parties.</p>
<p>At $34 for Prime Day, the Echo Dot is the least expensive way into a voice-activated home automation and daily convenience features that quickly become a necessity once you experience them.</p>
