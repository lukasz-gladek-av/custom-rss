            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>In 2014, before allegations of sexual misconduct against him became public, actor Kevin Spacey was one of the biggest names out there thanks to Netflix’s <em>House of Cards</em>. <a href="https://kotaku.com/kevin-spacey-the-kotaku-review-1654032299">And his role in that year’s<em> Call of Duty: Advanced Warfare</em></a> was a highlight. But now, it feels like a problematic relic. However, the game’s director, Glen Schofield, doesn’t think the shooter is “tainted,” even if Spacey was “weird” to work with.</p> <p><a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/call-of-duty/kevin-spacey-got-a-little-weird-on-the-set-of-call-of-duty-advanced-warfare-we-all-had-to-fake-laugh/">In an interview with<em> PC Gamer</em>,</a> Glen Schofield was asked about Spacey’s involvement in<a href="https://kotaku.com/lets-rank-the-call-of-duty-games-from-worst-to-best-1844765026/20"><em> Advanced Warfare</em> as the shooter’s main villain</a>. In 2014, Spacey delivered a fantastic performance that was praised by many critics and fans. In 2017, his role in the game became less celebrated after accusations of sexual harassment and assault were levied against the actor. While years later, he was ultimately not found liable for harassment and was <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2023/07/26/uk/kevin-spacey-trial-jury-verdict-intl/index.html">acquitted of assault</a>, Spacey’s reputation was still heavily damaged, and he appeared in fewer film and TV roles. Despite that, Schofield told the outlet that Spacey’s inclusion “doesn’t taint the game.”</p> <p>“At the time, that’s the actor I wanted,” said Schofield.&nbsp;“When he was on set, and we said action, he was unbelievable. He just is a great actor, right? Then when we said cut, you could tell the video games weren’t his thing. We had to get him a trailer. So he had a trailer outside that he would go in and he was a little bit more difficult, I would say.”</p>

 <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="et" dir="ltr">On set filming <a href="https://twitter.com/CallofDuty?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@CallofDuty</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/AdvancedWarfare?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#AdvancedWarfare</a>! <a href="http://t.co/2Q0jZPkiwT">pic.twitter.com/2Q0jZPkiwT</a></p> <p>— Kevin Spacey (@KevinSpacey) <a href="https://twitter.com/KevinSpacey/status/464570512510042112?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">May 9, 2014</a></p></blockquote>  <p><em>Advanced Warfare’</em>s director did claim that Spacey “got a little weird once in a while on the set.” Schofield added, “He would say things that just weren’t proper. We all had to fake laugh. There was some stuff.”</p> <p>Schofield explained that the initial pitch for <em>Call of Duty: Advanced Warfare 2</em> involved Spacey’s character returning in some form despite dying in the previous game. However, Activision passed on that pitch, which he’s grateful for now.</p> <p>“We were going to go there,” Schofield admitted, “and I’m glad we didn’t, because it was like two months before we would have shipped when the scandal broke.”</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><p><a href="https://kotaku.com/no-mans-sky-voyagers-6-0-star-trek-mass-effect-2000620674"><em>No Man’s Sky</em> players</a> are always talking about the fascinating planets they discover. Some are <a href="https://kotaku.com/no-man-s-sky-planet-porn-ghgs-hello-games-1849655173">breathtaking paradises</a> that look straight from the cover of a sci-fi paperback. Others are <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/NoMansSkyTheGame/comments/1kedf8j/rip_my_permadeath_file_beautifully/">deadly traps</a> ready to claim unsuspecting travelers as their next victims.</p><p>It’s less often that you hear about the weird creatures living on these procedurally generated space rocks. They are also randomized to simulate the diverging evolutionary trends of life finding a way throughout vast and far-flung corners of the cosmos. And on at least one of those planets are aliens that look like, well…this.</p><p>“I was going to show how beautiful this planet is, but then I saw these guys lolol,” UnderstandingDull174 posted on the <em>No Man’s Sky</em> subreddit <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/NoMansSkyTheGame/comments/1n0gjbr/i_was_going_to_show_how_beautiful_this_planet_is/">this week</a>. Lounging on tall grass under blue skies was what looked like—how else can I describe it—a dick and balls. Buoyant and springy, it greeted UnderstandingDull174 with the best of intentions. The planet might have looked like <em>Avatar</em>‘s Pandora but the inhabitants more like Cronenbergian abominations from <em>Rick and Morty</em>.</p><p>The player could also…milk them.</p><div id="t1_nar41ps-comment-rtjson-content"> <p>“I see there’s an option to induce egg,” wrote one player on the subreddit. “Whatever you do, don’t collect milk.” But it was too late. “I did, it squirted ‘sticky honey’ all over me lmao,” replied UnderstandingDull174. They even shared a <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/NoMansSkyTheGame/comments/1n0gjbr/comment/natgsg6/">screen capture</a> as proof. “Honey glands empty: 30 minutes,” it read.&nbsp; The creature also has <a href="https://www.reddit.com/media?url=https%3A%2F%2Fpreview.redd.it%2Fi-was-going-to-show-how-beautiful-this-planet-is-but-then-i-v0-7nzrgd5fublf1.jpeg%3Fwidth%3D1920%26auto%3Dwebp%26s%3D07e8a4d40fc808df3b5f8287e7ac4e713e84cedd">a hole on the bottom</a>. Sigh. The <em>No Man’s Sky</em> algorithm was really cooking with this one.</p> <p>The creatures were discovered in the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/media?url=https%3A%2F%2Fpreview.redd.it%2Fi-was-going-to-show-how-beautiful-this-planet-is-but-then-i-v0-j6wv4hga0flf1.png%3Fwidth%3D1658%26auto%3Dwebp%26s%3D7f4ae9d949e14e8892df9940aebf2ed07d3efa4b">Eissentam galaxy</a>, but others have reported sightings as well. “I saw one of those guys.,” reported Big_Party_2942. “I didn’t know the riding animation was like that.” Doomtoothx added, “I’ve ran into them multiple times. They do not respect boundaries and like to rub against you. Run away.”</p> <p>Players are trying to come up with an unofficial name. Astroglide was one. I’m not going to share the rest.</p> </div></div><br/><br/>https://kotaku.com/no-mans-sky-aliens-milk-eissentam-riding-2000621029]]></content:encoded>

              <p>The undead hordes are back in <em><a href="https://kotaku.com/gta-online-gtav-ps5-xbox-series-x-next-gen-review-impre-1848652706">Grand Theft Auto Online</a>,&nbsp;</em>but they aren’t hanging out in a snowy cemetery like in <a href="https://kotaku.com/gta-online-zombies-north-yankton-halloween-survival-1851664429">last year’s Halloween event</a>. Instead, zombies have infested the tropical island of Cayo Perico in a new mode that’s bigger and trippier than the last zombie survival mode.</p> <p><a href="https://www.rockstargames.com/newswire/article/ak3k38k52o5383/battle-hordes-of-undead-in-the-new-cayo-perico-survival?utm_source=twitter&amp;utm_medium=o_social&amp;utm_campaign=465:cayo-perico-zombie-survival-20250828">On August 28, Rockstar Games officially announced</a> (and then promptly added) a new zombie survival mode to <em>GTA Online.&nbsp;</em>Titled “Cayo Perico Zombie Survival,” this new mode transports players to the already existing tropical island of Cayo Perico to fight off waves of zombies. During the mode, which can be played solo or with three of your friends, players will encounter a wide array of undead foes, including DJ zombies and undead conquistadors. Remember when this was a gritty online crime simulator set in the same universe as <em>Grand Theft Auto V</em>? Anyway, here’s the trailer for the new mode:</p> <p><iframe loading="lazy" title="Battle Undead in the New GTA Online Cayo Perico Survival" width="500" height="281" src="about:blank" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen="" data-rocket-lazyload="fitvidscompatible" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/GbuCIrZSPDk?feature=oembed"></iframe></p> <p>Compared to last year’s Halloween zombies mode, this new Cayo Perico Zombie Survival is much bigger and wilder. Last year’s mode was set in one small snowy cemetery, featured a handful of zombie types, and that was it. This new mode features more enemy variety, moves players around the island to fight the undead in different spots, and just seems like a weirder and bigger thing. <a href="https://kotaku.com/gta-online-zombies-mode-ludendorff-cemetery-survival-1851672030">I guess last year’s zombie event being a massive success</a> convinced Rockstar Games to invest more money and resources into this new undead survival mode. It sounds like this mode will be leaving on September 10, so don’t wait too long to hop back into <em>GTA Online,</em> earn some new exclusive rewards, and kill a bunch of zombies.</p> <p>Here’s Rockstar’s official description of the mode:</p> <blockquote><p>Your favorite island paradise just came down with a deadly case of party fever. As if a major narcotrafficking island wasn’t dangerous enough, it’s now been overrun by the undead — and maybe it’s the drugs or the tropical climate, but this time they’ve got a whole lot weirder. Cut your way through waves of undead, including conquistadors armed with muskets, Panther Trainers and their feral pets, swarms of Splitters, and more in the new Cayo Perico Survival. Fight through these hordes and make your way to the airstrip — then pray your evacuation plane doesn’t take too long.</p></blockquote>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Amazon is going big for Labor Day and Back to School season, slashing prices on computers just as they are most in demand. This is the time of year when students purchase new items for school and professionals upgrade their rigs, so if there’s ever a time to shell out for a new system at a discount, it’s now.</p>
<p>And today, one of the hottest mini PCs on Amazon just hit a new record low: <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3768/">the Kamrui GK3Plus mini PC (16GB RAM 512GB M.2 SSD Mini Computers,12th Alder Lake N95), usually listed at $210, has dropped to $152</a>. That’s one of the steepest cuts we’ve seen on this compact powerhouse, and this is the kind of deal that won’t hang around long.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3768/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Improved GPU and CPU</h2>
<p>The GK3Plus is a small but serious desktop replacement <strong>based on Intel’s 12th-gen Alder Lake N95 chip</strong>. Clocking up to 3.4GHz on 4 cores and 6MB of cache, it’s a clear performance step up from the N100 and other previous-gen chips. Benchmarks show that it’s about 35% faster on CPU workloads and nearly 80% better on GPU, so more responsive multitasking and better graphics for your everyday needs.</p>
<p>Filled with 16GB of DDR4 RAM, it can run a number of programs at once without slowing down. That’s especially handy if you live in dozens of browser windows or switch between Office, Zoom, and Photoshop. As for storage, it has a 512GB M.2 SSD which translates to speedy boot times and plenty of space for documents, apps, and media. And if down the line you realize that you’re in need of more storage space, you can expand up to 2TB using a second 2.5-inch drive.</p>
<p>
k</p>
<p>It is a mere 5.1 by 5.1 by 1.9 inches in diameter (small enough to fit in one hand) and can sit quietly on a desk without appropriating valuable real estate. You can even mount it on the back of a VESA-supported monitor and create your own all-in-one solution for an efficient workspace. For home use, you can place it under your TV and turn an ordinary display into a 4K streaming device that handles much more than most smart TVs can handle.</p>
<p>Graphics performance is provided by embedded UHD Graphics at 1.20GHz with 4K at 60Hz and three displays at once through dual HDMI and VGA support. That means sharp text, vibrant colors, and silky smooth play back whether you’re watching movies, working on multiple documents side by side, or gaming at a casual level. Having the ability to work with three screens at once is a huge productivity gain because it enables you to arrange tasks without window juggling.</p>
<p>At this bargain, Amazon’s stock could easily run out before the holiday rush is over.</p>
