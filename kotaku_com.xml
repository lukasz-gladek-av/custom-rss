              <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/best-creepypasta-what-is-backrooms-tiktok-steam-reddit-1850298058">Liminal spaces and the “backrooms”</a> have become overused concepts on the internet, with people labeling any room or area that is even slightly off as some creepy space. It’s annoying and tiring. But I still like the idea of eerie, dead areas hidden in our world in places like forgotten hallways and empty hotel rooms. I also like fast-paced boomer shooters that feel great. So I’m a big fan of the newly released indie FPS <em>Oddcore</em>, which mashes all of this stuff up into one stylish game.</p> <p><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2896260/ODDCORE/?curator_clanid=4777282">Out now on Steam via early access, <em>Oddcore</em></a> doesn’t have much setup. One moment you’re hanging out in a room in your house, watching TV, before you suddenly clip through reality and enter a strange multidimensional hubworld called Oddcore that acts as a demented spin on a theme park. Sort of. It’s all very, well, dare I say…odd! Though it’s unclear why you’ve ended up here or what “here” even means, it doesn’t really matter much once you get past the tutorial. All that matters is lasting as long as you can as you hop between different liminal spaces and strange dimensions, killing all the bizarre monsters you encounter along the way with guns, swords, special abilities, and much, much more.</p>

 <h2>What kind of game is <em>Oddcore</em>?</h2> <p>The basic loop in <em>Oddcore</em> involves you hopping into a space and then completing an objective. It might be to kill 10 enemies. Or collect seven strange items. Or to survive a corruption ambush that sends deadly giant faces at you. You know, the usual stuff. Survive, and you hop to a new place and repeat. Killing enemies earns you souls, which can be spent to extend how much time you have before your run ends or to heal you via shooting your own feet. Between every few worlds, there are vending machines that let you upgrade your gear or abilities, and random boxes that contain power-ups and other useful specials.</p>

  <p>Survive long enough, and you’ll earn tokens which can be spent in various ways. I spent most of mine at a slot machine inside a large arcade in the hub world. That slot machine spit out tickets if I got lucky, and I could use those to buy other pieces of gear. There’s actually a lot going on in <em>Oddcore</em>, and after just an hour or so of playing, I could feel it start to pull me into its web. I wanted to do just one more run…earn just a few more tokens…play just a little bit more.</p>

 <p>It also helps that <em>Oddcore</em> has primo aesthetics. It’s got that retro boomer shooter look I’ve come to expect from these kinds of games in 2026, but augments that with monsters and locations that seem out of place. I recommend turning on the VHS filter as it covers all of the strange art and retro visuals in cozy scanlines that add to the experience. But even without the VHS filter, <em>Oddcore</em> is a damn fine indie shooter that will hopefully only get bigger and better as it makes its way through early access.</p>

              <p><span>It is never too late for you to develop a new skill and master it so well that you can’t help but stunt on at least 20,000 other people. Case in point: There is a 95-year-old grandmother out there who has never played an FPS game and might be a better shot than me, a 28-year-old who has played these games most of his life.</span></p> <p><span>As reported by </span><a href="https://automaton-media.com/articles/newsjp/20260107-400203/"><i><span>Automaton</span></i></a><span>, ZachsMaxed, a professional FPS player, recently shared a video on Twitter showing how his grandmother, Anne Krohley, is simply a better shot than many other players. In the clip, Krohley can be seen going through a trial in </span><i><span>Aimlabs</span></i><span>–a free program and game intended to train FPS players–called Spidershot, which emphasizes speed.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">I don’t know if people will appreciate how genuinely insane this is. At the age of 95, my legally blind grandma with no fps experience placed above 24k other players on spidershot in <a href="https://twitter.com/aimlab?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@aimlab</a>. Not only is she likely the oldest player to ever touch an aim trainer, she is also… <a href="https://t.co/rn4t6jJS6n">pic.twitter.com/rn4t6jJS6n</a></p> <p>— ZachsMaxed (@ZachsMaxed) <a href="https://twitter.com/ZachsMaxed/status/2008254887805809128?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 5, 2026</a></p></blockquote>  <p><span>To make matters more impressive, Krohley is legally blind. Per ZachsMaxed’s replies, Krohley suffers from macular degeneration, affecting her central vision a great deal. This explains the massive crosshairs that she uses in </span><i><span>Aimlabs</span></i><span> “so she can try and line up the target from her peripheral vision even if she can’t see it while directly on it.”</span></p>

 <p><span>Honestly, she could’ve fooled me, because aside from a few targets that disappear before Krohley trains her sights on them, she nails every shot. According to her leaderboard position and score, which can be seen near the end of the minute-and-a-half-long clip, Krohley improved her previous high score by 27 percent, or roughly 2,700 points. Krohely’s new high score put her above something akin to 24,000 other </span><i><span>Aimlabs</span></i><span> players.</span></p>

 <p><span>“Not only is she likely the oldest player to ever touch an aim trainer, she is also outpacing players less than half her age at the same experience level,” reads ZachMaxed’s post.</span></p> <p><span>The responses to Krohely’s tremendous feat have been a reminder that the world can be a pretty warm place after all. The official </span><i><span>Aimlabs </span></i><span>Twitter account responded, calling her accomplishment “amazing.” Someone else calls Krohely “the goat.” It’s worth looking through the replies and quotes to see people on Twitter being nice for a change.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><span>I don’t know about you, but I have become the biggest fan of Anne Krohely in about the span of an hour, and desperately need her to carry me as I try to get back into competitive FPS games.&nbsp;</span></p>
