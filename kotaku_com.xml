            <link>https://kotaku.com/this-amazon-black-friday-deal-delivers-huge-pc-performance-from-a-tiny-desktop-unit-for-just-190-2000639063</link>
            <guid>1367353</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>The novelty of having a palm-sized desktop PC can wear off once you realize that, in terms of performance, it sort of just gets by. “Meh” is not the reaction you want to have for a brand-new desktop PC, even if it’s saving you money upfront. GMKtec’s G10 Mini PC is not a “meh” machine at all — it can outperform many of its bigger full-tower rivals and even some of the big-brand laptops. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5036/">It’s well worth the new Amazon Black Friday price of $219, which is 27% less than its full retail $300 tag for a limited time.</a></p>
<p>GMKtec has managed to stuff all sorts of goodies and useful features into this 2-pound package, starting with an AMD Ryzen 5 3500U processor that can hit 3.7GHz when you put the pedal to the metal for multitasking, 16GB of RAM, a 512GB NVMe solid-state storage drive, and integrated Radeon Vega 8 graphics that’s powerful enough (1200 MHz) to run up to three external monitors. There’s also room under the hook to expand that RAM to 64GB and enough expansion slots and ports to drive the storage as high as 16TB.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5036/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>The Underdog Wins</h2>
<p>That AMD Ryzen 5 processor and Radeon Vega 8 integrated graphics might not grab your eye if you’re just skimming Amazon listings for Intel products. Which would be understandable since Intel is the gold standard for PC processors. But the Ryzen 5 3500U that’s at the heart of the GMKtec G10 has more than held its own in benchmark tests against Intel’s N-Series chips and often beats them, and for less money overall.</p>
<p>You can feel free to push the processor and the rest of the GMKtec G10 as hard as you want or need to, because all that hard work isn’t going to cause any internal meltdowns thanks to the tiny turbo cooling fan built into the mini PC’s body. That little fan can crank all day long, and do it quietly — 35 decibels, which is slightly louder than the sound of breathing.</p>



<h2>All the Connections</h2>
<p>The most important connections, of course, are the ones that get you on the internet, and the GMKtec G10 has Wi-Fi 5 and Bluetooth 5.0 along with a super-fast 2.5GB Ethernet jack. From there the connections are all about expansion and the ability to turn the GMKtec G10 into the hub of your workstation, and in that regard it’s fully loaded — dual USB-A 3.2 ports in the front, and a full array in the back, including HDMI 2.1 and DisplayPort 1.4, along with two USB-C ports (one for data) and another USB-A 2.0.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5036/">Jumping at this limited-time Amazon deal taking 27% off the price of the GMKtec MIni PC</a> isn’t settling. It’s grabbing a more-than-proficient desktop PC that can run up to 3 external monitors and handle all of your workload and then some for a great price — it’s just $190 while this deal lasts.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Garmin Offloads Its Cheapest Model Ever, Now Zero-Profit Play on Forerunner 55 GPS Running Watch]]></title>
            <link>https://kotaku.com/garmin-offloads-its-cheapest-model-ever-now-zero-profit-play-on-forerunner-55-gps-running-watch-2000648408</link>
            <guid>1367299</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Garmin is the number one brand of sports watches but their product range spans casual weekend joggers through professional ultramarathon athletes with vastly different feature needs and budgets. If spending $1,200 on the latest Fenix 8 feels excessive for your three-times-weekly runs, substantially cheaper alternatives deliver everything recreational athletes actually need.</p>
<p>The<strong> Forerunner 55</strong> is Garmin’s most affordable running watch and it <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4916/">currently costs $149 during Black Friday on Amazon, down from $199</a>. This new record-low makes legitimate GPS running watches accessible at pricing that approached basic fitness bands before this sale, while delivering the core training features that transform casual jogging into structured improvement.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4916/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Daily Suggested Workouts</h2>
<p>The <strong>adaptive training recommendations look at your recent workouts</strong>, your current fitness level, and how well you’re recovering to suggest daily workouts of different levels of difficulty. The AI-powered suggestions help you avoid common training mistakes like getting hurt from overtraining or not making progress because you’re not putting in enough effort. After hard interval sessions, easy run days give your body time to recover while keeping your training consistent, which is what really makes you fitter. Instead of giving vague advice,<strong> the workouts set clear goals for pace, duration, and intensity</strong>.</p>



<p>The GPS tracking shows the <strong>exact distance, pace, and route using satellite positioning</strong> which is much more accurate than phone-based tracking that has to deal with power-saving problems and signal drops. The watch keeps track of your real path instead of using step counting algorithms that make mistakes when you turn or go up or down. After a run, maps show exact routes and color-coded pace analysis shows where you sped up or slowed down, revealing patterns that were hard to see during the run.</p>
<p>The <strong>two-week battery life in smartwatch mode</strong> means you don’t have to charge it every night, which makes fitness trackers feel like they need a lot of care and attention. Wear it all the time to keep track of all your activities and sleep without having to charge it every day. The GPS mode lasts for 20 hours, which is enough for ultra-distance events or several weeks of training between charges.</p>
<p>The <strong>PacePro feature gives you GPS-based pace advice for planned courses</strong> or target distances: It helps you plan your race day strategy by giving you personalized pacing that takes into account changes in elevation and how much energy you have. Enter your goal finish time, and the watch will figure out how much you need to change your pace for hills: This will help you keep up a steady effort that keeps you from getting too excited too soon and bonking late in the race.</p>



<p>The activity profile includes a wide <strong>range of running styles such as track and trail running, as well as cycling, swimming, HIIT, yoga, and strength training</strong>. This variety allows for cross-training, which is important for preventing injuries. The watch can tell when you’re moving in different ways and uses the right tracking algorithms to keep track of your pool swim laps and figure out your cycling cadence from your wrist movement.</p>
<p>Advanced wellness monitoring goes beyond just tracking workouts: It<strong> includes all-day heart rate and respiration tracking, sleep analysis, and Body Battery energy monitoring</strong>. Stress tracking shows how daily life affects recovery, and sleep scoring measures the quality of sleep by looking at movement and heart rate variability. The Body Battery metric combines information about your stress, activity, and sleep into a single energy score that can help you figure out when is the best time to work out.</p>
<p>At $149, Garmin’s entry-level running watch is the cheapest it’s ever been on Black Friday – and it’s cheaper than many basic fitness bands that don’t have GPS or structured training features. If you want to improve your running without spending four figures, this is the deal for you.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Dyson’s Heater and Fan Combo Hits a 40% Black Friday Low, Practically a Christmas Gift for an All-Season Appliance]]></title>
            <link>https://kotaku.com/dyson-just-slashed-its-hotcool-am09-jet-focus-heater-and-fan-by-200-practically-giving-it-away-2000648205</link>
            <guid>1367296</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Winter is here, and if you’re anything like me, a central heating system (and multiple layers of socks) won’t be enough to warm those hands and feet up. You need something with an amplified airflow for both personal and whole-room heating. The Dyson Hot+Cool AM09 Jet Focus heater and fan does that job well, and its dual functionality makes it great for year-round use.</p>
<p>As you’d expect, like most other Dyson appliances, this one isn’t exactly the most affordable at $500, but thankfully, you don’t have to pay the full price today. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4614/">A 40% Black Friday discount has dropped the price to just $300, letting you save a whopping $200 for a short time.</a> The deal is open to both Prime and non-Prime users, but it could end soon. Get this sleek fan while the discount is live.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4614/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Multifunctional for Year-Round Comfort</h2>
<p>The fan uses Air Multiplier technology to deliver an uninterrupted stream of smooth airflow in both hot and cool modes. In winter, the ceramic plates heat up quick to deliver the cozy warmth your body needs, while the amplified airflow cools you down fast in hot weather, making it great to use any time of the year; snow or shine.</p>
<p>There are two airflow modes to choose from; Jet Focus and Diffused. The former directs the air at you, so it’s great for when you want the warmth or breeze to yourself. Diffused mode, on the other hand, gently cools/heats the entire room by oscillating at a 70-degree angle. Just came in after spending time with friends on a chilly evening? Warm those freezing hands up with the Focus mode. Once your body temperature is back up, you can switch to Diffused mode for even warmth all around. Changing modes is quick, thanks to the included remote that attaches magnetically to the Dyson hot plus hot for easy storage.</p>



<p>Those planning to use it at night will appreciate the built-in sleep timer that automatically turns the thing off after pre-set intervals. These can be anywhere from 15 minutes to 9 hours. Temperature ranges from 32°F to 98.6°F, meaning you won’t be stuck with a narrow range as with most traditional heaters and coolers. Before dozing off, set your ideal temperature, switch to the Diffused mode (unless you want to feel like you’re in the Sahara in winters or the North Pole in summers), and pick a timer setting. Taking a quick nap? 20 minutes should do. Calling it a day? Go ahead and set it for five or six hours. Since there are no blades involved, it operates fairly quietly, as well. Just note that it’s not cordless, so you’ll need to place it somewhere near an outlet.</p>
<p>All in all, if you’re looking for a heating and cooling solution with different operating modes and a wide temperature range, the Dyson Hot plus Cool AM09 Jet Focus heater and fan is an excellent option to consider. It provides you with the warmth and breeze you need, exactly how you want it to be delivered. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4614/">We recommend it even at its not-so-friendly $500 price tag, but the current $200 discount makes the upgrade quite affordable.</a> It’s also important to note that such massive drops tend to wrap up quickly, especially with the holiday rush kicking in. We highly suggest locking the discount in without wasting much time.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[At $0.02 Per GB, WD 5TB My Passport External Hard Drive Leaves No Margin on the Table]]></title>
            <link>https://kotaku.com/backup-your-data-with-a-5tb-external-hard-drive-for-just-125-for-black-friday-2000647687</link>
            <guid>1367284</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>With Black Friday here, tons of deals have now gone live across the web. If you’re trying to save some cash on some upgrades to your kitchen, some new toys, or some new tech, now’s the time to get shopping. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6037/">If you’re in need of more storage with your computer, Amazon has the WD 5TB My Passport Ultra external hard drive one sale for up to 19% off.</a> There are multiple size options to choose from, but the only ones part of the ongoing deal is the 2TB, the 4TB, and the 5TB. The 2TB has come down by $10 to just $80. The 4TB has come down by $15 to $125. However, the 5TB has come down by a significant $30 which also brings it to just $125. So there’s no reason to go with the 4TB right now as you can get an extra 1TB of storage for the same price.</p>
<p>This external hard drive is a great way to expand your device’s storage capacity quickly and easily. The My Passport Ultra can connect to your laptop or PC over USB-C. In order to ensure compatibility with older machines, a USB-A adapter is included.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6037/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<p>The drive is made to be durable and travel friendly. It has a sleek exterior casing made from anodized metal, offering your stored data protection when on the go.</p>
<p>Do note that this is a hard drive, not a solid state drive. Western Digital doesn’t list the exact specs for read and write speeds of its My Passport Ultra external hard drive, but don’t expect it to compare to the speeds of some newer SSDs. If you’re someone who finds themselves working on massive creative projects like editing video, this likely won’t be sufficient for you. It can still provide utility as a backup for your projects, but I wouldn’t recommended working directly from it for big videos timelines.</p>
<p>Likewise, this hard drive isn’t meant for gaming. Modern AAA titles require some pretty fast load times, so you won’t have any luck trying to play games from this. It’s also not compatible with consoles, using it with your PlayStation 5 or Xbox Series X. It may work with older consoles, or even simply for game storage with the the current generation stuff. Some external hard drives are able to be formatted to store PS5 or Xbox Series X games, but require that you move them back to your internal storage in order to play them. Though, again, Western Digital makes no mention of gaming here on the product page so your mileage may vary with this one.</p>



<h2>Scheduled Backups</h2>
<p>It seems this drive is primarily geared toward those in need of some place to backup their files. The included Acronis True Image for Western Digital allows you to even schedule backups. You can just keep the hard drive plugged into your laptop or PC and have it backup your files at regularly scheduled intervals.</p>
<p>The hard driver is equipped with security features which help protect against ransomware. You can fortify your important applications and help prevent data loss from ransomware attacks.</p>
<p>If you’re worried about someone malicious getting their hands on your files, or simply would feel a better peace of mind if no one could access but you. you can enable password protection at the hard drive level. You data will be locked behind a password of your choice with 256-bit AES hardware encryption.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Amazon Pushes Anker’s 3-in-1 MagSafe Charger to a Record Low Amid a Wave of Apple Deals, Despite Being Newly Released]]></title>
            <link>https://kotaku.com/cut-down-on-cable-clutter-with-this-3-in-1-prime-magsafe-charger-for-apple-devices-2000648208</link>
            <guid>1367251</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Topping all your essentials up in one go shouldn’t be a hassle. If you’re done dealing with cable clutter and plugging different devices into different outlets across the room, it’s time for an upgrade.</p>
<p>Anker makes some of our favorite charging solutions, and this Black Friday is a great time to upgrade your setup with one for less. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6036/">Right now, Apple users can grab its 3-in-1 Prime MagSafe Charger for iPhone, Apple Watch, and AirPods for just $150, down from $230</a>. You’re saving an impressive 35% on a wireless charging solution that’s safe to use, plus much faster and efficient than other options in the same range. It’s also its lowest price we have seen on it since launch.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6036/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Smart, Plus Powerful</h2>
<p>The 25W ultra-fast charging makes it around 6 times faster than most similar options out there, while TEC cooling keeps heat-related slowdowns at bay. An iPhone 17 Pro can hit 50% in just 22 minutes, so it’s much quicker than a standard charger. Support for iPhone, AirPods, and Apple Watch means you can juice all three up without the usual wait and clutter. Just toss them on before dozing off, and wake up to everything ready to take on the day with you. It also makes it great for when you’re in a rush and don’t have the time to plug everything in separately. Best of all, you won’t forget any of them, since all will be sitting right there next to each other.</p>
<p>The phone charger is flexible, and you can place your iPhone both horizontally and vertically; however you like. Planning to watch something at it charges? Go for the horizontal mode and let it double as a stand. There’s a built-in 1.65-inch HD display on the charging station to keep you in the loop about power, temperature, and charging status. The screen is customizable, and even shares safety alerts if something feels off.</p>



<p>Three power modes deliver different power levels for different routines. Boost Mode offers high-power charging for quick top-ups, and the Ice Mode keeps the devices cool as you use them while they charge. Finally, the Sleep Mode disables cooling and dims the display for quiet, safe overnight charging. Switching between the modes is made easy with the dedicated app, which also lets you schedule day and night times to enter or exit the sleep mode automatically. You can use it to customize your screensaver and view charging details just as well.</p>
<p>ActiveShield 5.0 performs over 10 million temperature checks a day to prevent overheating and maintain the battery health of your devices. As for compatibility, the charger plays nicely with iPhone Series 12 through 17, almost all the old and new Apple Watch series, plus AirPods 2, 3, 4, Pro, Pro2, and Pro 3. Just note that it’s not compatible with iPhone 16e. The box comes with the charger itself, a 65W GaN foldable adapter, a 5 ft USB-C to USB-C cable (10,000-bend tested), a welcome guide, 24-month warranty for some extra peace of mind. That’s everything you need to get started with it right away.</p>
<p>If you’ve been on the lookout for a smarter, no-fuss charging solution for all your important gadgets, this 3-in-1 Anker Prime MagSafe charger does a great job at that. It provides the power they need, plus maintains your battery health while it’s at it. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6036/">This deal takes $80 off its $230 price, letting you grab it for just $150.</a> The offer applies to both white and black color options, so you can pick the one that suits your aesthetics the best.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Google Pixel Buds Pro 2 Is Going Even Lower Than Its Planned Black Friday Price to Compete With AirPods and Galaxy Buds]]></title>
            <link>https://kotaku.com/google-pixel-buds-pro-2-drop-to-its-lowest-price-yet-for-black-friday-2000647626</link>
            <guid>1367236</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>With Black Friday happening, retailers have push the go button in the backend of their websites to have all their deals go live right now, ahead of schedule. If you’re still hunting for the right gift this holiday season for a friend, family member, or loved one, right now seems to be the best time to do so. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6032/">Amazon happens to have Google’s latest noise-cancelling premium earbuds—the Pixel Buds Pro 2— on sale for its lowest price yet</a>. The in-ear headphones and charging case normally clock in at $229, but ahead of November’s massive sales days, the price has come down to just $169. That 26% discount ends up saving you a whole $60 for a limited time.</p>
<p>The Google Pixel Buds Pro 2 come in five different color option, three of which are lucky enough to be part of the ongoing early Black Friday sale. You can chose between hazel, peony, or porcelain. Wintergreen and moonstone are either out of stock or absent from the discount. The color you choose only affects the buds themselves, as all color options come with the same white case with black interior.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6032/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<p>These earbuds are being toted by Google as its most comfortable earbuds yet. They are small, light, and have a secure fit in any ear size or shape. You can use a twist-to-adjust stabilizer which locks your earbuds in place which is great for a high-intensity workout. Then twist the other way to loosen them a bit for all-day comfort.</p>
<p>What separates the Pro model from the standard Pixel Buds is support for noise cancellation. The Buds Pro 2 are able to silence unwanted sounds from your surroundings so you can focus in only hearing only what you want to hear, be it music, a podcast, or audiobook. Active noise cancellation is enhanced further with the help of Googles Silent Seal 2.0 which is able to cancel up to twice as much noise as the original Buds Pro.</p>



<h2>Conversation Detection</h2>
<p>Now what happened when you don’t want to eliminate those environmental sounds anymore? Like maybe you’ve been waiting in line for Starbucks—kicking it to “Radio” by Bershy on loop, which you discovered from the awesome soundtrack of <em>Dispatch</em>—and now you’re up next to order. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6032/">The Google Pixel Buds Pro 2</a> are equipped with Conversation Detection. This will automatically pause your music and switch your earbuds to transparency mode when you start talking. Transparency mode basically filters in outside sounds in through the in-ear speakers, and you can activate it just by speaking. That means you don’t have to take out you earbuds, nor do you even need to awkward hold or tap while trying to strike up a conversation.</p>
