              <p>A monitor can make or break your gaming experience. It’s where your favorite characters come to life, and if your screen is lagging or just failing to deliver the visuals your games deserve, it’s time to look for a better option.</p>
<p>Thankfully, this upgrade doesn’t have to blow your budget today. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6710/">You can currently grab the 32-inch Samsung Odyssey G50D gaming monitor for $250 at Amazon, after the retailer took a whopping 42% off its usual (and not-so-friendly) $430 price.</a> This is the lowest we have seen this display drop to, ever. Just note that offers this good tend to wrap up fast. It’s best to place your orders before it’s too late!</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6710/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Smooth Gameplay</h2>
<p>The screen features QHD resolution that packs in roughly 1.7 times the pixel density of Full HD for an exceptional picture quality. The IPS panel keeps the visuals bright and vibrant, while the wide 178-degree viewing angle ensures clarity from any viewpoint. It’s especially helpful when you’re playing with friends, since not everyone needs to sit directly in front of the screen to see what’s happening. Additionally, VESA DisplayHDR 400 focuses on delivering better contrast with deeper blacks and prominent whites. You will be able to spot bad guys hiding in the shadows, plus explore cool in-game environments more clearly in daylight scenes. This level of depth also helps titles feel closer to reality for an immersive experience that makes you feel a part of the game.</p>
<p>The visuals are nicely paired with an impressive 180Hz refresh rate that eliminates lag for smoother action. A 1ms response time also reduces motion blur, helping you jump into action without waiting.</p>



<p>The gaming monitor is G-Sync compatible, which means it is designed to work well with NVIDIA GPUs by matching its refresh rate to the frame output of the GPU. Even better, it supports AMD FreeSync to keep complex scenes stable. What does this mean for you? Low input lag and smoother gameplay that gives you a competitive edge.</p>
<p>Those planning to game for long hours will appreciate the Eye Saver Mode, which minimizes blue light to keep your eyes comfortable throughout your sessions. As for the build, the monitor flaunts an ergonomic stand that comfortably swivels, tilts, and adjusts to help you find the right viewing position. You can even rotate it vertically when you need to read or take quick video calls!</p>
<p>To wrap it up, if you’ve been looking to upgrade your current monitor to enjoy better visuals and smoother gameplay, now is the time to make the move. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6710/">This 32-inch Samsung gaming monitor offers all that and more, and the current 42% discount makes the display far more affordable.</a> If the 32-inch size feels like too much, there’s a 27-inch version of the same model available for $230, down from $350.</p>

              <p><span>Nintendo, a company that </span><a href="https://www.nintendoworldreport.com/news/70994/nintendo-releases-2024-25-fiscal-earnings-and-projections-for-first-year-of-switch-2"><span>regularly brings in billions of dollars each year</span></a><span>, could have easily afforded to set up a real photoshoot to promote its upcoming line of </span><a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/my-mario/"><span>My Mario</span> <span>toys</span></a><span> coming to its New York City and San Francisco stores in February, but it looks like it might have used genAI instead. At least, that’s what people think after looking at the photos of parents playing with their kids and the </span><i><span>Mario </span></i><span>toys.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>I admit, the </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/fortnite-season-7-gen-ai-tim-sweeney-latata-2000649103"><span>AI witch hunt</span></a><span> has gotten out of hand, so when I looked at the supposed AI images, I had several moments of doubt. Maybe some people’s hands and fingers just look like that, and the growing fear that AI art is infecting everything around me has completely distorted my idea of what hands look like? Maybe it’s possible for a thumb to twist like that, or for a child’s hand to squish into their mother’s like we see here.&nbsp;</span></p>

I’ve got tiny hands, so maybe I’m not the best judge.</span></p>

 <p><span>Whatever the case, fans have already run with the assumption that these images are AI-generated in the replies to Nintendo’s social media posts on </span><a href="https://www.facebook.com/NintendoAmerica/posts/pfbid02fPQ2Jr4GHpvW19uvHJgrWejxt3XMRWWF3yAjMtvi18VQsL8HjMiCgiTtp3rfQpVJl"><span>Facebook</span></a><span> and </span><a href="https://x.com/NintendoStoreUS/status/2009280600608268620"><span>X</span></a><span>.&nbsp;</span></p> <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">Introducing My Mario, a collection of products, games, and experiences inspired by Mario and his Mushroom Kingdom friends, designed for young children and their parents.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Larian Studios CEO Swen Vincke has now shared more details about how the acclaimed RPG studio will be approaching the use of generative AI tools for developing its next game, <a href="https://kotaku.com/divinity-turn-based-rpg-larian-studios-early-access-date-2000653845"><em>Divinity</em></a>. Speaking to fans in an AMA on Reddit, the director walked back a previous statement that Larian would use generative AI to help with references for concept art, but did say that <em>Divinity</em> could include gen-AI assets in the finished game as long as the studio is “100 percent sure about the origins of the training data and the consent of those who created the data.”</p> <p>The gaming veteran landed in hot water last month <a href="https://kotaku.com/larian-gen-ai-divinity-baldurs-gate-3-rpg-2000653912">over comments in an interview with<em> Bloomberg</em></a> about how Larian was experimenting with AI tools in the production of its next game, including generating references for concept art, producing PowerPoints, and other early production work that could help speed up the prototyping trial and error phase. At the same time, the CEO doubled down on the idea that no AI elements would appear in the finished game and stated that the studio wasn’t turning to the controversial tools to try and cut its headcount.</p>

 <p>In today’s AMA, which was promised in response to the prior backlash, Vincke said that AI will no longer be used at all in the concept art phase, but did suggest the studio is looking at ways to use gen-AI tools trained exclusively on the company’s own material. Here’s his <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Games/comments/1q870w5/comment/nyl9tdz/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button">full statement</a>:</p>

 <blockquote><p>So first off – there is not going to be any GenAI art in Divinity.</p> <p>I know there’s been a lot of discussion about us using AI tools as part of concept art exploration. We already said this doesn’t mean the actual concept art is generated by AI but we understand it created confusion.</p> <p>So, to ensure there is no room for doubt, we’ve decided to refrain from using genAI tools during concept art development.</p> <p>That way there can be no discussion about the origin of the art.</p> <p>Having said that, we continuously try to improve the speed with which we can try things out. The more iterations we can do, the better in general the gameplay is.</p> <p>We think GenAI can help with this and so we’re trying things out across departments. Our hope is that it can aid us to refine ideas faster, leading to a more focused development cycle, less waste, and ultimately, a higher-quality game.</p> <p>The important bit to note is that we will not generate “creative assets” that end up in a game without being 100% sure about the origins of the training data and the consent of those who created the data. If we use a GenAI model to create in-game assets, then it’ll be trained on data we own.</p></blockquote> <p>Larian’s new position addresses two of the chief criticisms of generative AI tools. The first is that they’re used by companies to undercut and replace human creatives. The second is that they produce content stolen from the millions of people whose work they were trained on. A set of gen AI tools trained entirely on Larian’s own proprietary game assets could potentially side-step that second critique, though it also suggests that <em>Divinity</em> could include at least some assets that were generated with the help of AI.</p>

 <p>Developers have long used machine learning and procedural generation to help create pieces of a game that humans can then go and tweak as needed. It would be impossible to craft the beautiful cosmos of <em>No Man’s Sky</em> by hand. The bulk of its universe is generated from algorithms designed by the team at Hello Games. But as technology advances, algorithms have been able to produce more and more of the stuff that players might find in a finished game, leading many fans to balk at things like sloppy gen-AI loading screen art and even at the use of algorithms to generate spoken performances for NPCs, a subject of some controversy for <em>Arc Raiders</em>.</p>
