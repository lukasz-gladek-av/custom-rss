The port will launch on July 17, but this early footage may be running the 2.3 update already, because fans have taken note of what might be an autopilot icon when V gets behind the wheel. <em>The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt </em>had a similar function when you rode your horse, allowing you to trot along to your destination without having to move your character yourself. If <em>Cyberpunk 2077</em> got a similar feature, it would actually be a genuine improvement to the game because its cars handle like they’re hydroplaning. Motorcycles run well enough, though. However, sometimes the plot requires you to drive a car for races and high-speed chases, and that shit <em>sucked</em>.

Hell, in the vast travels I took across the states, Canada, and a sliver of the UK in my 20s, I took tons of videos and photos that I haven’t looked at in many years, but I’d be really upset if I found they were just suddenly <em>gone</em>.

There are many video games that capture this spirit of stillness, of just being in awe of a visual spectacle that communicates a sense of place.

But India’s Central Board of Film Certification (CBFC) reportedly removed that 33-second mid-air smooch from <em>Superman</em>. </p><p>Why was this scene removed? According to India’s CBFC, the kiss was “overly sensual” for <em>Superman’s </em>UA (13+) rating, which is similar to the MPAA’s PG-13 rating in the United States. Reportedly, another kiss between the two lovebirds was also removed for similar reasons. This is likely the lengthy kissing scene that happens in Lois Lane’s kitchen earlier in the movie. </p><p>The news that kissing scenes were removed from <em>Superman</em> led to reported backlash online from members of India’s movie industry.</p><p><em>Variety</em> spotted Actor Shreya Dhanwanthary <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://x.com/shreyadhan13/status/1943602667890078128&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://x.com/shreyadhan13/status/1943602667890078128" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">reacting negatively to the reports of Superman’s censorshi</a></span>p: “If this is true, this is RIDICULOUS!!!

Now, studios’ only option to dispute such rulings is through India’s courts, which is expensive and takes forever, and doesn’t work for most movie release schedules.</p><p> .<br></p></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://kotaku.com/superman-big-kiss-cut-india-censored-dc-lois-lane-cbfc-1851786333]]></content:encoded>
