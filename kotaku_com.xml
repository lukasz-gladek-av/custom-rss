              <p>Earlier today, Bethesda released a new video dedicated to the future of <em>Fallout</em>. And while the studio announced a new version of <em>Fallout 4 </em>and showed off more of <em>Fallout 76</em>‘s next big update, there was no explicit mention of a <em><a href="https://kotaku.com/fallout-5-show-todd-howard-amazon-1851325762">Fallout 5</a></em>. But don’t worry, Bethesda’s creative director Todd Howard wants you all to know that “more” is coming and he’s excited to share it with fans…eventually.</p> <p>In case you weren’t aware, October 23 is known as Fallout Day among the fan community. It’s the day that, in the video game franchise and TV show, the bombs dropped and destroyed the world. A weird day to celebrate, but hey, every mass media franchise needs a holiday to get excited about once a year. Anyway, on Thursday, for the second year in a row, Bethesda aired a Fallout Day Broadcast aka a <em>Fallout</em> Direct filled with some new trailers and updates on the series. <a href="https://kotaku.com/bethesda-fallout-4-switch-2-2026-anniversary-edition-trailer-xbox-ps5-2000638638">The big news was <em>Fallout 4</em> making its way to Switch 2 in 2026</a>. But, for those hoping for <em>Fallout 5</em> to be announced or <a href="https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Fallout_3_remaster">the rumored <em>Fallout 3</em> remaster</a> to be shadow-dropped during the event, well, it was a disappointing presentation. That might explain why, at the end, Howard showed up to assure fans that the company was still working hard on more <em>Fallout</em> games.</p>

  <p>“Even though I am recording this—it’s not live—and I’m probably watching myself right now from my desk and I’m reading your chat and these…that thing you want and this other thing you want…Hey, we read it all,” said Howard. “Just know, we are working on even more. We are looking forward to the day when we can share that with everybody. But thank you again for tuning in and happy Fallout Day.”</p>

 <p>And…that was it. The stream then cut to a video of <em>Halloween</em> director and gamer John Carpenter (?!) claiming to be the biggest<em> Fallout 76</em> fan and then wishing everyone a happy Fallout Day as well. Thanks, John! <a href="https://youtu.be/HMDSfOs1EPY?t=1313">While Howard did also show up at the end of last year’s Fallout Day event</a>, it was a much shorter experience that didn’t seem so apologetic.</p>

 <p>It’s clear that Bethesda knows there’s a large demand for <em>Fallout 5</em> and other <em>Fallout</em> games. That demand has existed for years now, but has only grown larger thanks to the really successful Amazon TV show. That likely explains <em>Fallout 4: Anniversary Edition</em> getting a Switch 2 port, and the next<em> Fallout 76</em> update adding the Ghoul from the show as a quest-giving NPC. It’s an easier way to get more <em>Fallout</em> content out there that might appeal to both players and TV show fans.</p>

 <p>Bethesda’s next big RPG after <a href="https://kotaku.com/starfield-the-kotaku-review-1850883627">2023’s <em>Starfield</em></a> is <em>The Elder Scrolls 6</em>, not <em>Fallout 5.</em><a href="https://kotaku.com/fallout-5-v-bethesda-elder-scrolls-6-release-date-starf-1849062025"> In 2022, Howard confirmed that <em>TES6</em>, announced in 2018, was entering pre-production</a> and was still years away from release. After that’s done, Howard confirmed Bethesda will make <em>Fallout 5.</em> But considering how long these games take to make, that means the next main entry in the post-apocalyptic RPG franchise might be close to a decade away at this point.</p> <p>In 2024, <a href="https://kotaku.com/fallout-5-new-vegas-2-fo3-remaster-starfield-dlc-1851544120">Howard explained in an interview</a> that Bethesda doesn’t want to “rush” out a new <em>Fallout</em> single-player RPG and pointed to <em>Fallout 76</em> and the TV show as options for fans longing for new <em>Fallout</em> content. But considering how successful the company’s <a href="https://kotaku.com/oblivion-remaster-elder-scrolls-eso-glitch-meme-1851777557"><em>Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion</em> remaster</a> was earlier this year, I wouldn’t be shocked if, in a move intended to provide players with more <em>Fallout</em> games quickly, we see a similar remake for<em> Fallout 3</em> and maybe even one for<em>&nbsp;Fallout: New Vega</em>s in the future. And there’s always next year’s Fallout Day!</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><span>When I </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/dualsense-edge-controller-playstation-5-review-kotaku-1850018508"><span>agreed to review the DualSense Edge</span></a><span> for this here </span><i><span>Kotaku </span></i><span>period com, I didn’t know I was getting ready to break my brain from decades of video game muscle memory habits. I hadn’t used a modular controller before, and I wanted to approach the PS5 premium controller from the perspective of someone who maybe didn’t see what all the fuss was about. Every video game I play already has button assignments for any action I could do. What was the point of putting two extras on the back? But once I saw the light, it became nearly impossible for me to go back to a standard DualSense, and when I do hold one of the default controllers, I feel my fingers scratching at the back for back paddles that are no longer there.</span></p> <p><span>This came up today because Sony is selling a </span><a href="https://direct.playstation.com/en-us/buy-accessories/dualsense-wireless-controller-god-of-war-20th-anniversary-limited-edition"><i><span>God of War </span></i><span>20th anniversary DualSense controller</span></a><span> stylized to look like the titular god Kratos’ ash-white skin and blood-red tattoos. I like the design of the controller a lot, and even if I didn’t love </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/god-of-war-ragnarok-review-release-date-ps4-ps5-spear-1849734382"><i><span>Ragnarök</span></i></a> <span>(the excellent </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/god-of-war-ragnarok-valhalla-dlc-review-1851097244"><i><span>Valhalla </span></i><span>DLC</span></a><span> really brought me around on it, though), Kratos still occupies a cozy little place in my heart. In another life, I would have scooped it up, even at the whopping $85 price point. But that hefty chunk of change gave me pause. That’s grocery money for a controller that, in all likelihood, I wasn’t going to use. I’ve become so accustomed to having back paddles after two years of playing games with my DualSense Edge that the standard PS5 controller feels almost like a toy in my hands. So if I did buy this Kratos-themed controller, it would probably just be a display item. And that’s a pretty expensive thing to stick on shelf space I don’t have here in the Big Apple.</span></p>

 <p><span>I’ve bought controllers I don’t use before. I own an Xbox Pride controller that sits on my shelf next to all my </span><i><span>Mass Effect </span></i><span>stuff because </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/lgbtq-games-mass-effect-romance-options-overwatch-pride-1850586480"><span>Kaidan Alenko made me gay as a teenager</span></a><span>. But that was a special case where I saw something covered in rainbows and reacted accordingly. Nowadays, I default to my DualSense Edge whenever I can, so I’m not just picky with my money, I’m picky with my controllers. The Edge isn’t even the best version of a modular controller, as it’s pretty limited compared to its contemporaries like the Xbox Elite, but it has rewired my brain to reach for back paddles in shooters and action games.</span></p>

 <p><span>The moment it all changed for me was when I was testing the Edge for our review while playing </span><i><span>Overwatch 2</span></i><span>. As I described in my review, a Pharah was flying behind my team’s backline and shooting rockets down upon my helpless supports. As Soldier: 76, I reloaded while turning around to shoot down my airborne foe. I had mapped the square button to the right paddle and could turn the right analog stick with my thumb to change where I was facing, rather than having to pick between the two actions. That split-second difference saved me from getting blown up, and it was all thanks to this bougie-ass controller. It’s such a small change, but I’ve gotten so used to having the option that my brain defaults to it now. I usually have jump mapped to the left paddle and either reload or dodge on the right. For the longest time, I would have to remap buttons in action games to the default </span><i><span>Devil May Cry </span></i><span>control scheme because I spent so much time playing the old PS2 games that the layout had hardwired itself into my brain. The circle button is the dodge button, right? It’s supposed to be! Now, my hands naturally search for a back paddle to move out of the way. Even when I’m playing games on my Switch 2 like </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-legends-za-review-switch-2-bugs-performance-2000637719"><i><span>Pokémon Legends: Z-A</span></i></a><span>, I’m wishing I had an easy dodge button on the back of my Joy-Cons.</span></p> <p><span>I know it’s an unreasonable ask, but I would be so much more inclined to buy these special controllers if Sony made Edge variants, so I didn’t feel like I was sacrificing function for the sake of the aesthetic. And now it’s hard for me to justify buying collector’s items when my tiny apartment only has so much room. You think I didn’t want that </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/new-ps5-controller-last-of-us-dualsense-ugly-price-sony-1851768135"><span>kinda dumb-looking </span><i><span>Last of Us </span></i><span>controller</span></a><span>? Although now that I’m looking at it, I probably could have fit it on my </span><i><span>TLOU </span></i><span>shelf next to the Joel statue. Actually, never mind, I looked at the price again. Maybe I should look into modding these controllers myself. There’s gotta be some sicko out there who’s willing to mess with all the circuitry and put these back paddles on the Kratos controller.</span></p>
