Likewise, it’s an excellent tool to have on had in an emergency situation like during a blackout or if your car has broken down on the side of the road. It’s good to be able to keep a charge phone in such events.</p>
<p>Built durably to last, the Anker portable power station has a lifespan 10 times as long as comparative models. Even after a full year of not being used, it will still have retained at least 85% of it’s charge. This way, if you are keeping it on hand in your car or in your closet in the event of an emergency, it will work for you as expected when it comes time that it’s needed.</p>



<p>The power bank includes a smart display on the front which can communicate helpful information while powering or charging your devices. It can be set to show the power station’s battery life, input and output power, remaining charge time, charge modes, among other data.</p>
<p>Atop the power station is an LED light which can be set to two different brightness modes. The convenient strap allows it to be easy to pick up and transport.</p>
<p>Choose between either green or gray for the Anker power bank. Both color options are on sale right now for 47% off. That brings them down from $150 to just $80, saving you $70 for a limited time.</p>

              <p>Between 4K videos, raw photo files, game libraries, and endless work documents, running out of storage space feels like a monthly crisis. The Seagate expansion 20TB external hard drive solves this problem in one massive swoop, and right now, Amazon <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4615/">has slashed the price from $499 down to just $229 for both Prime and non-Prime members</a>. This early Black Friday deal <strong>beats even Seagate’s own website pricing</strong>, and here’s the kicker: you’re paying the same price you’d normally fork over for a 10TB drive.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4615/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Massive Storage Meets Desktop Convenience</h2>
<p>This is not a portable drive you will slip into your pocket: The <strong>Seagate 20TB device is a desktop unit that requires its own power supply</strong>&nbsp;which gives it the muscle to deliver consistent performance for your bulkiest files. Inside the black enclosure lives a 7200 RPM Seagate <em>BarraCuda</em> drive with a 512MB cache, pushing <strong>read speeds around 246-257 MB/s and write speeds of 239-256 MB/s</strong> according to real-world testing. These numbers mean you can transfer a 50GB game in about three to four minutes, or back up your entire photo library from the past decade without aging five years in the process.</p>
<p>The <strong>drive connects via USB 3.0 using a micro-USB port</strong> and it comes pre-formatted in exFAT so both Windows and Mac machines recognize it immediately. Just plug in the included 18-inch USB cable and 18W power adapter, and you’re ready to drag and drop files without installing a single piece of software. Mac users who want to use Time Machine will need to reformat the drive, but that’s a quick one-time setup.</p>



<p>It also includes Seagate’s <em>Rescue Data Recovery Services</em>&nbsp;which means if the worst happens, <strong>you’ll have access to pro data recovery</strong>. The service covers everything from accidental deletion to physical damage; you’d need to check the fine print for limitations. You also get international power adapter plugs, which are a nice touch if you travel or switch countries. There’s a <strong>one-year limited warranty on the hardware</strong> while most external drives tend to run hot during operation, this one reportedly stays at around 55°C, which is warm but not concerning.</p>
<p>The real story here is value: While the prices of external drives have dropped, this deal presses the cost per terabyte down into territory usually reserved for smaller capacity drives. It’s large-capacity drives make sense for media professionals, gamers with massive libraries, or anyone needing to archive years of files without having cloud subscription fees eat into their budget month after month</p>
<p>This drive won’t supplant a speedy NVMe SSD for active work, but for long-term storage, or consolidating scattered files across multiple older drives, it delivers exactly what most people need.&nbsp; You’re getting a 20TB drives in one unit for $229, which means you’re paying $0.01 per GB. And this is a record low.</p>
