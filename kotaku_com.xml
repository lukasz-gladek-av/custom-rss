            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/overwatch-2-persona-5-skins-crossover-mercy-genji-joker-2000625739"><i><span>Overwatch 2</span></i></a><span> is winding down its 18th season this week, with its 19th set to begin on October 14. The season doubles as both a return of the hero shooter’s previous Halloween events, and a chance to shake things up with new modes, tweaks, and some rarer rewards than seasons past. While breaking down all that’s coming in season 19, Blizzard also teased something coming in season 20: hero 45.</span></p>  <p><span>Blizzard’s full developer update breaks down several changes and additions happening in season 19. The Halloween event this year is called Haunted Masquerade, and it lets you put on masks based on different heroes that grant you different perks. Some of these buffs are simple, such as Tracer’s mask granting you increased movement speed and Junkrat’s making your enemies explode when they die. Other hidden perks are found when you pair some masks with specific heroes. If you’re playing as Brigitte, for example, wearing the Reinhardt mask will make your shield as large as his. It also looks like a Mei mask might add a Blizzard effect to Juno’s Ultimate, allowing you to freeze enemies in a straight path. So it looks like a lot of interesting, unexpected combos await.</span></p>

 <p><span>On the Stadium side of things, Torbjörn, Sojourn, and Hazard are being added to the build-centric mode, and some of their upgrades look pretty nasty. Torb can create multiple upgradable turrets to place around the field, Sojourn can get a Soldier: 76-style auto-aim when she ults, and Hazard can now shoot bursts from the spikes on his back. Those are just a few examples of how their play styles will no doubt change as you upgrade and tweak your build throughout Stadium’s long matches. Ana has been in the mode for a while, but she is also getting a rework to change up some of her loadouts. All characters are also getting consumable gadgets that they can use throughout the match that will grant you temporary buffs. One example shown in the video is an item that makes your hero grow in size with increased damage and defense.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><span>Mythic Skins, the customizable prestige skins released each season, have been a bit hit-or-miss since </span><i><span>Overwatch 2</span></i><span>’s launch, but the </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/lifeweaver-overwatch-2-pansexual-season-4-support-hero-1850294521"><span>Lifeweaver’s</span></a><span> Divine Druid Mythic skin is really fucking gorgeous. Blizzard is retooling the </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/overwatch-2-mythic-skin-store-prisms-battle-pass-mercy-1851414356"><span>Mythic upgrade levels</span></a><span> so you’ll unlock more significant alterations more quickly, but that’s not the only major change happening this season. In season 19, Blizzard will release two mythic skins, rather than just one. The second one will be for </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/overwatch-2-skin-contest-china-junkrat-furry-diaper-2000630263"><span>Junkrat</span></a><span> and will be available in the mid-season patch. We didn’t see it, but Blizzard says it’s called “Cyberfuel.”</span></p>

 <p><span>Closing out the presentation, Blizzard revealed it is finally putting all of the external lore media, such as comics and animated shorts, in the game itself. So now those of you who only really interact with </span><i><span>Overwatch 2</span></i><span> through the game itself will be able to read and watch these in your launcher. Everything we can glimpse in this new section of the main menu during the presentation is recent material from </span><i><span>Overwatch 2</span></i><span>, so it’s unclear just how far back in the lore we’ll be going here. Will this be a one-stop shop for works dating back to the original game? We’ll see next week. After talking about the past, Blizzard also teased the future with hero 45. The sword-wielding damage hero will be getting a trial session at some point during season 19, but all we saw of her was a silhouette and a brief shot of her legs as she shouts, “Ready yourselves for war!”&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>This mystery swordswoman was briefly teased in the </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/overwatch-2-story-missions-comic-zenyatta-ramattra-2000628236"><span>latest motion comic</span></a><span> starring Ramattra and Zenyatta, where she was seen standing in front of an explosion with her giant sword. </span><i><span>Overwatch 2 </span></i><span>doesn’t have enough melee-centric heroes, so hopefully she spices things up when she joins the roster in season 20.</span></p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/pokemon-legends-za-discount-cheap-switch-2-metroid-prime-4-2000633703</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/the-cheapest-way-to-buy-the-switch-2%E2%80%99s-biggest-holiday-games.1321195/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Switch game vouchers. Discounted eShop gift cards. Those are the keys to getting <a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-legends-z-a-leaks-switch-2-image-mega-evolution-2000630717"><em>Pokémon Legends: Z-A</em></a> and <a href="https://kotaku.com/metroid-prime-4-release-date-motorcycle-open-world-2000625308"><em>Metroid Prime 4: Beyond</em></a> for the cheapest possible price at launch. You think Nintendo does Black Friday deals for new games? In this economy?! Nope!!!</p> <p>You’re probably already familiar <a href="https://kotaku.com/nintendo-switch-game-voucher-discount-save-deal-cheap-1851684045">with this discount method</a>. You wait until Newegg or some other virtual currency reseller <a href="https://www.newegg.com/nintendo-50-00/p/N82E16832074004">has a deal</a> on Nintendo eShop gift cards. Usually it’s $5 off of $50. You can then add that currency to your digital wallet and use it to buy Switch game vouchers which act as free coupons to redeem full-price games. You get a pair for $100 and use them to buy two $60 games. In this case, that’s <em>Pokémon Legends: Z-A</em>, out October 16,&nbsp;and <em>Metroid Prime 4: Beyond</em>, out December 4. You save $30. It’s effectively buy one, get one 50 percent off.</p>

 <p>But you’re thinking, “Wait, I have a Switch 2 now. I want the Switch 2 versions of those games.” The same deal applies. You just have to pay for the $10 Switch 2 upgrades separately. You end up shelling out $110 instead of $140 (the Switch 2 versions are normally $70). It’s still $30 off the combined total but more of a buy one, get one 40 percent off deal. So it goes with Nintendo.</p>

 <p>The company <a href="https://kotaku.com/switch-2-vouchers-pokemon-za-metroid-prime-4-preorder-1851785969">announced earlier this year</a> that it’s killing off game vouchers going forward, but fans still have until January 30, 2026 to purchase them and use them on current Switch games. After that date, Nintendo will stop selling the game vouchers, but you’ll have an additional 12 months to redeem any existing ones before they expire. Maybe Nintendo will introduce a revised version of the program for Switch 2 once we’ve fully transitioned over.</p> <p>In the meantime, it’s your best bet for a more affordable double-feature this holiday, at least if you don’t mind owning the games digitally. Which I know some of your do. At least neither of their physical versions are game key cards, even if they do fall victim to the ugly new Switch 2 box art labels.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[This 4.6-Star Rated Soundcore Portable Bluetooth Speaker Selling for Post-Prime Pennies]]></title>
            <link>https://kotaku.com/this-4-6-star-rated-soundcore-portable-bluetooth-speaker-selling-for-post-prime-pennies-2000633350</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/this-4-6-star-rated-soundcore-portable-bluetooth-speaker-selling-for-post-prime-pennies.1321159/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>The memo that Prime Day is over hasn’t made its full rounds yet, because there are still some crazy tech deals floating around Amazon that are too good to miss. Here’s another one that could be a “like it now, love it later” buy, looking ahead to when the warm weather returns: <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4669/">the Soundcore Motion 100 portable Bluetooth speaker, with IPX7 waterproofing to go along with its great sound, just had its price cut in half to just $40.</a></p>
<p>The Soundcore Motion 100’s waterproofing, compact size, and handy built-in loop for carrying or hanging make it a perfect shower speaker for when the pool and beach parties aren’t an option, and when the great outdoor are calling you back, it’s ideal for looping onto bike handlebars, hanging from a backpack or a canopy with a carabiner, or just carrying since it only weighs 1.3 pounds.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4669/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Little Speaker, Big Sound</h2>
<p>A speaker this small shouldn’t sound this big or this good, but that’s the Soundcore Motion 100’s calling card. It brings quality, detailed sound at up to 40kHz, with the option to hit the BassUp button to get that deep chest-thumping bass going. It’s app-controlled, with a detailed 9-band EQ control that gives you the power of in-depth customization.</p>
<p>That sound is driven by dual full-range drivers, with a bold 20W output with or without the extra bass. The total effect vastly outpunches the modest size of the speaker — barely over 7 inches long by 2.5 inches wide by 2 inches tall. As a shower speaker or compact yet powerful home speaker living on a shelf, it more than does the job. As a source of quality music on the go, it’s among the best.</p>



<h2>Why Stop at Just One?</h2>
<p>The Motion 100 can also be paired with another Motion 100 to create a surround-sound experience. When one Motion 100 is just $30, why stop there? A quality portable surround sound system for $60 is more than a little tempting. You won’t wear them out, either, since they have a robust 12-hour life on a single USB-C charge.</p>
<p>When a 4.6-star-rated portable Bluetooth speaker is available at Amazon for $60, and it’s IPX7 waterproof so it can be a shower speaker, poolside speaker, and everything in between, it’s worth serious consideration. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4669/">When that very same speaker gets an unexpected 50% price cut and becomes a $40 speaker, it becomes a truly great deal</a>. We’re still leaning toward buying two of the Soundcore Motion 100 portable Bluetooth speakers to get that surround sound going, but there is going to be at least one in our Amazon shopping cart imminently.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[The Discord Hack Sounds Really, Really Bad]]></title>
            <link>https://kotaku.com/the-discord-hack-sounds-really-really-bad-2000633690</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/the-discord-hack-sounds-really-really-bad.1321123/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>I got a strange <a href="https://kotaku.com/discord-sdk-nitro-ads-ipo-profitable-splitgate-2-1851770484">email from Discord</a> last Friday at the very end of the work day informing me of “a recent security incident on September 20 involving your personal data.” It said personal info related to my account had been compromised, but not full credit card info or my personal address. The email made it seem like only a small number of people were impacted and simply told me to “stay alert” about any suspicious emails I might get. Suspicious? On the internet? In 2025? Good luck! Nearly a week late it’s becoming clear that this “limited access” hack of a “third-party customer service system used by Discord” is a much bigger deal than it originally seemed.</p> <p>“A small number of government‑ID images (e.g., driver’s license, passport) from users who had appealed an age determination” were included in the leak, Discord informed users like me last week. According to a <a href="https://www.404media.co/the-discord-hack-is-every-users-worst-nightmare/">new report by <em>404 Media</em></a>, the hackers responsible gloated in a Telegram group that they actually had 1.5TB of users’ personal data. Discord admitted to <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/797051/discord-government-ids-leaked-data-breach?ref=404media.co"><em>The Verge</em></a> last night that it actually believes up to 70,000 users may have had their government IDs breached. There’s already a <a href="https://www.law360.com/articles/2397306/discord-sued-after-user-info-leaked-in-breach-of-vendor">class-action lawsuit</a> being filed in California.</p>

 <p>One of the big culprits in this entire mess is legislation like the UK’s controversial Online Safety Act which requires users to prove to platforms that they’re 18 years or older using selfies and government IDs. In the era of <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/features/2025-10-07/openai-s-nvidia-amd-deals-boost-1-trillion-ai-boom-with-circular-deals">a $1 trillion generative AI deal-industrial complex</a>, that feels like potentially putting your entire identity up for grabs on the internet. “Online ID checks may seem like a common-sense solution, but that facade hides a much darker truth: lawmakers are pressuring companies to implement surveillance and censorship tactics and it’s putting all of us in danger,” <a href="https://www.fightforthefuture.org/news/2025-03-06-new-letter-90-civil-rights-and-privacy-organizations-condemn-id-checking-bills-citing-effectiveness-censorship-and-privacy-concerns/">anti-surveillance campaigner</a> Sarah Philips told&nbsp;<em>Kotaku</em><em>&nbsp;</em>in an email.</p>

 <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">Chat, we are cooked</p> <p>Discord is being extorted by the people who compromised their Zendesk instance</p> <p>They've got 1.5TB of age verification related photos. 2,185,151 photos</p> <p>tl;dr 2.1m Discord users drivers license and/or passport might be leaked. Unknown number of e-mails</p> <p>— vx-underground (@vxunderground) <a href="https://twitter.com/vxunderground/status/1975834621503062495?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 8, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <p>As <em>404 Media</em> reports, the hackers have been threatening the popular social gaming platform with partial releases of its trove of sensitive data, which includes everything from partial phone numbers to the last time a given user was seen on Discord. The samples reportedly include screengrabs of thumbnails of users’ identification selfies as well as a help desk ticket that seemingly belongs to alleged <a href="https://kotaku.com/charlie-kirk-shooter-steam-library-valve-discord-radicalization-2000626897">Charlie Kirk shooter Tyler Robinson</a>.</p>

 <p>How did the hackers get this data to begin with? A spokesperson for ZenDesk, the third-party customer service company supporting Discord, told 404 Media its systems were “not compromised.” Infosec account vx-underground <a href="https://x.com/vxunderground/status/1976238815665856646?ref=404media.co">was told</a> the breach came via an outsourced support agent.</p>

 <p>“All affected users globally have been contacted and we continue to work closely with law enforcement, data protection authorities, and external security experts,” Discord spokesperson Nu Wexler told <em>The Verge</em> earlier this week. “We’ve secured the affected systems and ended work with the compromised vendor. We take our responsibility to protect your personal data seriously and understand the concern this may cause.”</p> <p>Discord did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the claims it’s being extorted or the vulnerability that led to the hack.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>SBMM (skill-based matchmaking) enters the news yet again as <i>Black Ops 7</i>’s devs have fully committed to an about-face on the highly debated practice of matching folks with relative skill levels in online matches with randos. Not only will matches have more variety of skill level across players, but perhaps most excitingly, randomly matched lobbies that vibe well can stick together across multiple games, much like how things used to work in the good old days of <i>Halo 3</i> and other shooters that let people party up and play together in game after game more seamlessly.</p> <p>The news broke <a href="https://www.callofduty.com/patchnotes/2025/10/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-beta-patch-notes">via a blog post</a> following the game’s beta (<a href="https://x.com/charlieINTEL/status/1976285808446537995">h/t <i>CharlieIntel</i></a><i>)</i>, and it’s music to the ears of many. In theory, grouping up people of similar skill levels in random matches sounds good. In practice, opponents of this approach argue that it leads to sweatier, more competitive matches. Its overuse effectively eliminates a more relaxed playstyle in which every match isn’t just a zero-sum game for aspiring esports competitors to rule the leaderboards.</p>

 <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">The SBMM war is over… never thought we'd see it <a href="https://t.co/nMnglDVgdv">https://t.co/nMnglDVgdv</a></p> <p>— Jake Lucky (@JakeSucky) <a href="https://twitter.com/JakeSucky/status/1976296080267719063?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 9, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <p>SBMM isn’t being totally thrown out. The dev blog states that there’ll be “minimal skill consideration” for default <i>BLOPS 7</i> games. So hopefully that means we won’t see too many players with a pro-level skillset demolishing folks just looking to unwind after work with a few rounds of <i>COD</i>.</p> <p>I’m skeptical that this pivot will see the debate over SBMM go away. Still, it’s a great opportunity for <i>BLOPS7</i> to serve as a case study for how devs can design matchmaking features that optimize having fun without shutting out the more competitive players amongst us.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[This HP Laptop Was Pricier Than a MacBook, Now It’s Nearly 90% Off and Feels Practically Free (16GB RAM, 512GB SSD)]]></title>
            <link>https://kotaku.com/your-eyes-arent-lying-this-87-off-hp-touchscreen-laptop-at-amazon-is-a-real-thing-2000629668</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/this-hp-laptop-was-pricier-than-a-macbook-now-it%E2%80%99s-nearly-90-off-and-feels-practically-free-16gb-ram-512gb-ssd.1321084/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>The days of the touchscreen laptop living in the premium price slot may be over for good, if this Amazon post-Prime Day deal is any indicator. <a href="https://www.amazon.com/HP-Touchscreen-Processor-14-Bluetooth/dp/B0FMJJH35F/?tag=kotaku01-20">The original $2,999 price tag on this 14-inch HP touchscreen Intel laptop might verge on ridiculous, but the 87%-off deal that drops that number down to just $390 is also ridiculous, but in a good way</a>.</p>
<p>The huge leaps forward made by tablets and their keyboard attachments may have taken eyes off of the touchscreen laptop, but this HP model is proof that a solid everyday laptop with a touchscreen isn’t just a novelty. Students, creatives, and everyday users who just can’t deal with a trackpad will love how easy the touchscreen makes using this laptop.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4672/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Solid Foundation</h2>
<p>The guts of this HP touchscreen laptop are right at that sweet spot between “more than you’ll ever need or use” and “so puny that I can’t do anything without lagging.” The Intel Celeron N4500 processor (up to 2.8GHz burst frequency) and Intel UHD graphics chip won’t win in a footrace against premium laptops, but they won’t slow you down at all when you get deep into your daily multitasking. They’re backed by 16GB of RAM and a 512GB SSD, so there’s plenty of room for your files, projects, and apps.</p>
<p>Then there’s the touchscreen and all of the possibilities it presents. Pair it with an inexpensive stylus — there are literally dozens of them at Amazon — and you can annotate presentation slides or other documents, or even jot down quick notes or sketches for yourself on the fly. The touchscreen also lets you tap, scroll, and pinch to zoom in like a tablet. Soon you’ll be swiping through pages and menus and browser tabs faster than you ever could with a trackpad or mouse.</p>



<h2>Office 365 Included</h2>
<p>This deal comes with one year of Microsoft Office 365 Personal, which includes all of the premium Office apps like Word, Excel, PowerPoint, and Outlook, and also cloud storage and the security of Microsoft Defender. The HP True Vision 720p HD webcam with dual-array mics and HD Audio speakers make this touchscreen laptop a natural for Zoom meetings and other video calls, and two SuperSpeed USB-A ports, an HDMI 1.4b port, and a SD card reader are great expansion options.</p>
<p>We’d be pulling your leg if we told you this was a solid $2,999 laptop. But while it falls short of that impossibly high mark, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/HP-Touchscreen-Processor-14-Bluetooth/dp/B0FMJJH35F/?tag=kotaku01-20">it most definitely overdelivers on the new $390 price tag it’s rocking right now during this post-Prime Day 87%-off deal at Amazon.&nbsp;</a></p>
