              <p>Most people can’t justify dropping $2,000 on a laptop, especially when reliable performance for basic tasks like browsing, video calls, and document work will suffice. That’s where HP’s 15.6-inch touchscreen laptop hits (Intel Core i3, 32GB RAM, 1TB SSD), right between capability and affordability: Right now, <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5291/">it’s selling for $626, slashed from its usual price of $1,999</a>. That’s a discount of $1,373 that brings professional-grade specs within reach, and HP sweetens the deal even further with $299 worth of bonus accessories.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5291/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Built for Everyday Computing</h2>
<p>The Intel Core i3-1315U processor brings six cores to the table: performance cores for handling demanding tasks and efficiency cores for managing background processes. This 12th-generation chip reaches speeds up to 4.5GHz when you need some extra power.</p>



<p>That 32GB of DDR4 RAM is the real game-changer here: Most budget laptops ship with 8GB or maybe 16GB, which forces you to close applications constantly to avoid lag. This much memory future-proofs the machine by ensuring that it stays fast as software becomes more demanding over the course of several years.</p>
<p>With 1TB SSD storage, you can install your operating system, applications, photos, and videos including a music library without having to go through the inconvenience of deleting files or managing external drives. Solid-state drives load Windows and applications in seconds, while old-school hard drives take minutes.</p>



<p>The 15.6-inch HD screen adds intuitive interaction to your daily workflow. You can tap icons, swipe through photos, pinch to zoom in documents, and scroll through web pages with your fingers. Touch makes Windows 11 feel more natural and instinctive, especially for creative tasks or casual browsing. The HD resolution provides clear text and snappy images for spreadsheets, presentations, and video playback, even if it’s not quite as crisp as Full HD screens on pricier models.</p>
<p>It comes pre-installed with Windows 11 Pro which gives you access to features you don’t find in any Home edition, such as BitLocker encryption to keep sensitive files safe, Remote Desktop to access your laptop from elsewhere, and enhanced security tools designed for business. Thanks to fast charging technology, it gets your battery back to practical levels in a short time and minimizes any downtime when working on the go.</p>
<p>The <strong>$299 accessory kit that accompanies this deal</strong> throws in some practical extras, such as a laptop sleeve to keep it protected on the go, a wireless mouse for easier navigation, and other niceties that would cost you extra otherwise. For $626, this HP laptop gets you the specs and features most people actually need without the premium price tag.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Last week, over 30 developers <a href="https://kotaku.com/gta-6-rockstar-games-union-busting-delay-2000640525">were fired from Rockstar Games</a>. A trade labor group claims the <em>Grand Theft Auto 6</em> studio was union busting, but Rockstar Games now claims the employees were leaking sensitive information. The dispute comes just as the long-awaited blockbuster is getting ready to ship in May 2026.</p> <p>“Last week, we took action against a small number of individuals who were found to be distributing and discussing confidential information in a public forum, a violation of our company policies,” a Rockstar spokesperson <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-11-05/-grand-theft-auto-studio-says-fired-employees-were-leaking-information?accessToken=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJzb3VyY2UiOiJTdWJzY3JpYmVyR2lmdGVkQXJ0aWNsZSIsImlhdCI6MTc2MjM4NDU1NSwiZXhwIjoxNzYyOTg5MzU1LCJhcnRpY2xlSWQiOiJUNUEwS0JHUFdDTDgwMCIsImJjb25uZWN0SWQiOiJCMUVBQkI5NjQ2QUM0REZFQTJBRkI4MjI1MzgyQTJFQSJ9.PipR6t4x9M3EqRs9jXeXrZNn3d-RZBZhXyh8pTYZhFs">told <em>Bloomberg</em></a>. “This was in no way related to people’s right to join a union or engage in union activities.”</p>

 <p>Rockstar did not immediately respond to a request for comment clarifying the nature of the confidential information that was allegedly disclosed.</p> <p>The ex-Rockstar developers were in a private message group on Discord with the Independent Workers’ Union of Great Britain (IWGB) when they were fired last week for what parent company Take-Two called at the time “gross misconduct.” The IWGB has been seeking to organize developers across various UK-based gaming studios, including <a href="https://www.gameworkers.co.uk/workers-at-za-um-announce-landmark-recognition-agreement/"><em>Disco Elysium</em> maker ZA/UM</a> and <a href="https://kotaku.com/mindseye-development-leslie-benzies-gta-bugs-union-layoffs-2000633983"><em>MindsEye</em> maker Build a Rocket Boy</a>.</p>

 <p>“Management are showing they don’t care about delays to <em>GTA 6</em>, and that they’re prioritizing union-busting by targeting the very people who make the game,” IWGB president Alex Marshall told <em>Bloomberg</em> in response to Rockstar’s new allegations. He maintained the fired employees were only discussing issues related to “exercising their rights for a fairer workplace and a collective voice.”</p> <p>The IWGB did not immediately respond to a request for comment.</p> <p><em>GTA 6</em>‘s release date has already slipped once and some are <a href="https://polymarket.com/event/gta-6-launch-postponed">placing bets</a> that it could miss the new May 26 release date as well. The game has had one of the most secretive development cycles of any major blockbuster, outside of the details leaked in <a href="https://kotaku.com/gtavi-gta-vi-gta-6-grand-theft-auto-leak-video-dump-1849550414">an unprecedented hack</a> back in 2022. Since then, Rockstar has only released two official trailers.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/dell-begins-black-friday-with-70-off-this-1tb-ssd-windows-laptop-prime-gets-nearly-2300-off-2000641504</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/dell-begins-black-friday-with-70-off-this-1tb-ssd-windows-laptop-prime-gets-nearly-2-300-off.1345186/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Usually, finding a laptop that powers everything without slowing down means spending serious money. Dell’s Inspiron 16 laptop rewrites that equation completely: This machine packs <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5366/">professional-grade specs into a package that now costs $995, down from its typical $3,299 price tag</a>. That is a <strong>$2,304 discount</strong> that brings enterprise-level performance within reach of students and anyone tired of their sluggish laptop holding them back.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5366/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Power That Keeps Up With Your Workload</h2>
<p>Inside is an Intel Core 7 150U processor that drives this machine up to 5.4 GHz across 10 cores split between 2 performance cores and 8 efficiency cores. This hybrid architecture essentially means the laptop knows when to unleash full power for demanding tasks and when to dial back for basic browsing, really maximizing both speed and battery life.</p>
<p>The 12 threads enable the processor to juggle multiple operations at one time, so you can render a video while downloading files and streaming music without watching everything grind to a halt.<strong> Intel’s Core 7 also includes dedicated CPU, GPU, and NPU engines</strong> that accelerate AI-powered features in Windows 11.</p>



<p>That <strong>32GB of DDR5 memory</strong> makes a tangible difference in daily use. DDR5 is the latest memory standard that’s faster and more power-efficient than older DDR4. You can have 50 browser tabs open, run Adobe Creative Suite applications and have Spotify playing in the background, then jump between everything in an instant. The 1TB SSD provides ample room for your operating system without needing to constantly manage space or use external drives.</p>



<p>The <strong>16-inch FHD+ touchscreen display runs at a 1920×1200 resolution</strong>, and provides more space vertically than the standard 1920×1080 screens. Those extra 120 pixels make spreadsheets easier to read and mean less scrolling when working with documents. With its 300-nit brightness, the screen can stay visible in bright rooms or near windows, and its anti-glare coating cuts down on reflections that cause eye strain during long work sessions. The touchscreen adds intuitive interaction: pinch fingers to zoom in on photos, swipe through documents, and navigate Windows 11’s touch-optimized interface with your fingers.</p>
<p>Connectivity options include: USB 3.2 Gen 1 Type-A ports for legacy peripherals, including mice and external hard drives; a Thunderbolt 4 port that enables 40Gbps data transfer to drives and enables the driving of high-resolution external monitors; an HDMI port suitable for presentations and second screens; and a universal audio jack for headphones.</p>
<p>With this Dell Inspiron laptop, performance that would normally cost three times more is available for 70% off.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/apple-goes-all-out-with-black-friday-deal-macbook-air-crashes-to-a-brand-new-record-low-2000641489</link>

              <p>Apple doesn’t usually advertise big discounts on its own website but the company quietly drops deals through Amazon from time to time. The MacBook Air with M4 chip and 256GB SSD storage (which launched in March 2025) is no exception to this pattern. For the first time ever, a MacBook Air this recent is getting a serious price cut just months after its release: We saw it hit $799 during Prime Day, but <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3761/">Amazon’s early Black Friday deal brings it down to $749 which marks a brand new all-time low from its original $999 price tag</a>.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3761/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>The Right MacBook for Apple Intelligence</h2>
<p>This is no ordinary laptop refresh: The 2025 MacBook Air with M4 chip is <strong>Apple’s first consumer machine built from scratch for Apple Intelligence</strong>, the suite of AI-powered features transforming how you’ll interact with your Mac. The <strong>Retina display on this 13.6-inch gadget</strong> shows sharp text and brilliant colors at a resolution of 2560×1664, with 500 nits of brightness that makes everything from spreadsheets to Netflix binges look crisp and clear.</p>



<p>Beneath the cool Midnight aluminum chassis, you’ll find 16 GB of unified memory: <strong>That’s double what Apple offered in the base models</strong> until recently. That matters because unified memory is a little different from traditional RAM. It’s shared between the CPU and GPU so that both have instant access to the same pool of fast memory, without having to copy data back and forth. What this practically means is that you can keep dozens of browser tabs open, edit large photos, run many apps at once, and get zero slowdown. The 256GB SSD storage offers you enough room for your OS, most essential apps and a solid collection of files.</p>
<p>The M4 chip itself is a beast for everyday computing and <strong>touts an 8-core CPU and 8-core GPU on a 3-nanometer process</strong> that handle everything from web browsing up to light video editing without breaking a sweat. You get up to 18 hours of web browsing and up to 15 hours of video playback from one charge, which means you really can work all day long without having to hunt down an outlet. The<strong> chip also contains a 16-core Neural Engine</strong> that’s exclusively designed to accelerate machine learning tasks, powering features such as real-time language translation, advanced photo editing and Apple Intelligence capabilities.</p>



<p>The 12MP Center Stage camera sits centered above the display and keeps you in frame during video calls: As you move around, the camera pans and zooms to follow you, making remote meetings feel more natural and professional. Touch ID is integrated into the keyboard, allowing you to unlock your Mac, authenticate purchases, and switch between user accounts using only your fingerprint<strong>. Two Thunderbolt USB 4 ports provide transfer speeds up to 40Gbps</strong>, support for external displays up to 6K resolution, as well as fast charging.</p>
<p>Weighing in at just 2.7 pounds and 0.44 inches thin, the MacBook Air slips into any bag without adding noticeable weight to your daily carry.</p>
<p>And you’re getting a machine at $749 that should stay relevant for years to come, with Apple’s history of providing software updates for seven years or more.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/amazon-clears-out-its-pixel-9-stock-for-practically-nothing-just-ahead-of-holiday-rush-2000641352</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/amazon-clears-out-its-pixel-9-stock-for-practically-nothing-just-ahead-of-holiday-rush.1345153/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><span>Google unveiled its latest and greatest Pixel 10 in August this year, but last year’s Pixel 9 is still a great option to invest in if you’re looking to upgrade. In fact, with prices on newer models climbing higher, the Pixel 9 is looking like one of the better value buys you can get right now, especially with the current drop.</span></p>
<p>Amazon is being generous with<a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5365/"> a 38% discount on this 2024 model, which brings the price down to $499</a>. That’s a straightforward $300 drop, and you don’t need to enter a coupon code or go through complicated checkout processes to secure the deal. The offer applies to all color options, including black, porcelain, and wintergreen. It’s also unlocked, meaning it’s going to work with all major carriers.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5365/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Simple Design, But Packed With Power</h2>
<p>This slim, sleek phone features curved edges and a glass front and back for that premium look. The 6.3-inch Actua display is bright, pushing crisp, detailed visuals to make the content pop. 120 Hz refresh rate keeps everything running smoothly, whether you’re just browsing or trying to play a game.</p>
<p>The phone is packed with Tensor G4, which is Google’s most powerful chip yet. There’s 12 GB RAM for lag-free performance, plus 128 GB storage to house all your essentials. You’ll be able to store tons of media content, all your favorite apps, games, and a lot more, without feeling limited.</p>



<p>You also get a 50MP main camera and a 48MP ultrawide with Macro Focus. Google’s software takes it further with tools like Best Take (to help everyone look their best), Magic Editor (for quick editing), and Add Me (gets the whole group together in one photo). Whether you’re shooting on a bright sunny day or trying to record a scary prank at night, camera quality stays consistent throughout.</p>
<p>Gemini integration makes it even easier to get through your days and boring tasks. You can ask it to summarize content, circle an image or text to search the web, draft replies, etc. And since the Pixel 9 is fully unlocked, you’re free to use it with any major carrier, including Verizon, AT&amp;T, T-Mobile, Google Fi, and more.</p>
<p>Amazon also offers a trade-in program that could get you up to $650 in savings when you send in your old phone. The value is issued as gift card credit, but note that you might not be able to combine this with the current discount, so double-check the details before checking out.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Lighting affects your mood, and smart lights make it easy to control both the brightness and color of your space. You can add warmth to your space when you feel like relaxing (also great for the holiday season), or go for a brighter setting for when you need to focus; all remotely.</p>
<p>Those ready to switch up the lighting situation in their home; we come bearing good news. You can now <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5364/">grab the Philips Hue starter kit for just $97 on Amazon, thanks to a 46% discount</a>. That’s a rare drop from its regular $179 price, and you’re getting three A19 smart LED bulbs, a Hue Bridge, and a Hue Smart Button in the box. The product is also rated as Amazon’s Choice on the retailer. We just recommend acting fast to grab it, because the offer might end soon!</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5364/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>A Million Colors, Plus a Wide Temperature Range</h2>
<p>Each bulb is a 75W-equivalent A19 LED. It supports both white and full color ambiance, meaning you can adjust the white temperature or pick from over a million colors to create a vibe that reflects how you’re feeling. Need to focus on a work task? Go for a brighter setting that lets you concentrate. Feel like relaxing after a long day? A nice, warm tone should help you wind down. Hosting a gathering on the weekend? Something playful, fun is going to leave your guests impressed!</p>



<p>You can adjust the lights through the Hue app, the included button, or even just use your voice to let Alexa or Google Assistant take care of it. The app gives you more control, as you can set timers, play around with the color palette, etc. As for the button, you can place it anywhere with the included magnet and use it for quick control. It lets you customize up to 5 scenes, so you can tweak settings without pulling your phone out.</p>
<p>Then there’s the Hue Bridge, which connects directly to your WiFi router to act as a hub for your system. You can use it to control lights from anywhere, plus unlock advanced features like automations and routines. And since it’s Matter compatible, you can always connect your lights to other smart home devices across platforms.</p>
<p>The setup is simple. All you need to do is install the bulbs, plug in the Philips Hue Bridge, and connect it to the WiFi router, then download the Hue app. Follow the on-screen instructions to complete the process within a few minutes!</p>

              <p>We all rely on multiple devices to get through our days, and keeping all of them charged can get challenging. This is especially true for those who are out and about often and can’t afford to sit around waiting for one device to finish charging before plugging in the next. A multi-port, high-output charger can come in handy in these situations, and we just spotted a powerful option going for less on Amazon.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3814/">100W Baseus USB-C charger block is currently sitting at $29, after a massive 40% drop on its retail price of $49</a>. Both color options (black and white) are discounted. Even better, <strong>you can score a free USB-C cable (valued at $8)</strong> with your purchase. To claim it, click on the <em>“How to claim”</em> link next to the Get 1 free item label on the product page. In the tab that opens, add the charger to your cart, then navigate to the Benefit Item section and add the USB-C cable to your cart as well.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3814/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Three Ports to Juice Multiple Devices</h2>
<p>The charger comes with two USB-C ports and one USB-A port, so you can juice up to three devices at once. Using the single USB-C port gets you up to 100W of power, and when multiple devices are plugged in, Baseus’ BPS 3.0 smart power distribution automatically allocates the required output to each connected device.</p>



<p>Support for all major fast-charging protocols (PD 3.0, QC 3.0, and PPS) translates into efficient charging for a wide range of devices, whether it’s your smartphone, iPad, MacBook, or even Steam Deck. There’s thermal control built in, as well. Baseus Cooling Technology (BCT) monitors temperature consistently in real-time to prevent any overheating problems.</p>
<p>It’s also 43% more compact than most chargers out there, so carrying it around won’t feel heavy. The pins fold down, so you can easily throw the block in your bag or even your pocket and get going. It’s great for remote workers, travelling, plus convenient home use.</p>

              <p>Last month, cosplay streamer <a href="https://kotaku.com/emiru-twitch-dan-clancy-assault-safety-investigation-2000639234">Emily “Emiru” Schunk</a> accused fellow Twitch star <a href="https://kotaku.com/mizkif-twitch-otk-allegations-apology-comeback-stream-1849944560">Matthew “Mizkif” Rinaudo</a> of sexually assaulting her. He’s now suing her and streamer <a href="https://kotaku.com/asmongold-twitch-ban-youtube-gaza-israel-hasan-piker-1851672928">Zack “Asmongold” Hoyt</a>, who covered the allegations during multiple streams, for defamation over the fallout, including loss of equity from his former media company OTK as well as management fees from associated agencies who recently cut ties with him.</p> <p>“Through the acts and omissions described below, Defendants Schunk, Hoyt, and OTK have, acting in concert, wrongfully and baselessly accused Rinaudo of serious criminal activity for no purpose other than to harm him, his reputation, and his business—and wrest from him control of the companies that he helped build,” <a href="https://www.courtlistener.com/docket/71869253/1/rinaudo-v-schunk/">the lawsuit</a>, filed in Texas District Court on November 3, reads (via <a href="https://www.kxan.com/news/top-twitch-streamer-files-defamation-lawsuit-against-fellow-streamers/">KXAN</a>).</p> <p>Emiru accused Mizkif of “psychological and domestic abuse, stalking and harassment, sexual assault, and threats of blackmail” during <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBUmFyCt3yU">an October 25 livestream</a>. “He started kissing me in my face and I let him do it,” she said, detailing the alleged assault. “I was still sobbing a lot. And then suddenly he tried to climb on top of me and aggressively shoved his hands down my pants and I screamed. And when I screamed he jumped off me, like a cat.”</p> <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">OTK fully supports its co-owner and sister Emiru and we stand by her side and admire her strength in coming forward and sharing her story.</p> <p>While Mizkif was one of several founders of OTK, the organization terminated its relationship with him some time ago for reasons unrelated…</p> <p>— OTK (@OTKnetwork) <a href="https://twitter.com/OTKnetwork/status/1982890213031768293?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 27, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <p>The lawsuit accuses Asmongold of piggybacking off these claims across multiple streams, calling Mizkif “the aggressor and abuser,” and saying that he should go to jail for what he “allegedly” did. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v_na4AazJ0g">In his own stream</a> responding to the accusations, Mizkif appeared to admit he was controlling of her and said they would get in bad fights but denied the most serious allegations of misconduct.</p> <p>OTK <a href="https://x.com/OTKnetwork/status/1982890213031768293">later announced</a> that it stood by Emiru’s claims and that it previously terminated its relationship with Mizkif for unrelated reasons, while Mythic Talent Management has reportedly now dropped him for breach of contract and is demanding almost $1 million in fees. Mizkif’s lawsuit claims Emiru’s allegations led OTK to remove all equity he had left in the organization without compensation and is accusing its current (Emiru) and former (Asmongold) members of conspiring against him.</p> <p>“Schunk and Hoyt knew at the time that they published these statements that they were false,” the lawsuit reads. “On belief and information, Schunk and Hoyt knew they stood to benefit from Rinaudo’s ouster from OTK and the associated companies and coordinated the timing of their statements to maximize the injury inflicted to Plaintiffs.”</p> <p>Emiru and Asmongold have not yet publicly commented on the lawsuit. Emiru previously said she was in the process of <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/LivestreamFail/comments/1og5bn2/emiru_is_on_the_process_of_filing_a_restraining/">getting a restraining order</a>&nbsp;placed against Mizkif.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>So let’s say it’s a Tuesday night, you’ve got an hour-ish to kill, and you have a copy of <i>Arc Raiders</i>. In a game with menu-heavy navigation, a deep crafting system, and of course the ever-present threat of dying unexpectedly and losing all of your stuff, you might wonder just how much you can get done, especially if you’re a solo player.</p> <p>Well, friends, I decided to document just such a scenario. On a recent Tuesday night (last night, in fact), I jumped in for about an hour and fifteen minutes of my time in <i>Arc Raiders</i> to get a sense of what this game looks like when you’re not mainlining it for tens of hours straight (my first run at the full game was a virtually uninterrupted 20-hour session). Also, as I mentioned, I ran solo last night. <i>Arc Raiders</i> is perfectly solo-able, so long as you’re willing to play a bit more stealthily. So let’s jump into what you can expect in <i>Arc Raiders</i> with about an hour or so of your time.</p>

 <p>First, let’s set some expectations. I’m about 53 hours into <i>Arc Raiders</i>. I’ve built up every crafting workshop, leveling some of them up to level two, and my Raider was at level 38 when I fired the game up, so I’ve progressed up the skill trees a fair bit. This is what my skill tree looked like as of last night:</p>

 <figure id="attachment_2000641438" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000641438"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000641438">© Screenshot: Embark Studios / Claire Jackson / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <h2>My first quest: Finding Rope; my first obstacle: My overflowing Stash</h2> <p>I’ve done a substantial number of quests in the game thus far. They’re all pretty much the same thing: Go somewhere, find a key location or object, flip a switch or gather a specific amount of materials, then head out. Hardly riveting subject material, but in a game this open-ended, you really just need some points to go to for random emergent opportunities to present themselves.</p>

 <p>I was tackling the “Eyes In The Sky” quest, for which I’d already completed two out of the three simple objectives: Go somewhere specific on three different maps and install LiDAR Scanners. Fortunately, those LiDAR scanners aren’t actual inventory items I need to manage. I just need to go to a spot and hold down the E key.</p>

 <p>But there was a problem: My final objective required me to build a zipline, which needs <a href="https://arcraiders.wiki/wiki/Rope">Rope</a> and for whatever friggin’ reason, I haven’t come across much Rope lately.</p> <p>I’ve also been avoiding going on Night Raids, which see any given map set at night with fewer extraction points, and the promise of better loot.</p>

 <p><b>Read More:</b> <a href="https://kotaku.com/arc-raiders-tips-solo-group-recycle-free-loadout-2000641174">14 Essential Tips For Getting Started In <i>Arc Raiders</i></a></p> <p>My first impulse was to just grab the Free Loadout. As I mentioned <a href="https://kotaku.com/arc-raiders-tips-solo-group-recycle-free-loadout-2000641174">in my beginner tips</a>, the Free Loadout is a perfect way to dust yourself off from a defeat or, in my case last night, warm up a bit without the concern of losing some precious gear. But like when a loose thread on your sweater gets caught on something, <i>Arc Raiders</i> said “not so fast.”</p>

 <figure id="attachment_2000641439" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000641439"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000641439">© Screenshot: Embark Studios / Claire Jackson / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p>Yes, my Stash was full. This is a topic I’ve seen discussed a fair number of times over on the game’s subreddit and here and there in the official Discord. <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ArcRaiders/comments/1on8lst/psa_if_your_stash_is_always_full/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button">Hoarders don’t have it easy in this game</a>. Keep in mind, I’ve expanded the storage of my Stash several times by spending the game’s non-premium currency (which you can just sell random items to earn). Still, the game wouldn’t let me go out with a Free Loadout because that would give me more items than I have space for.</p>   <p>It’s frustrating, but the game basically said “girl, use the stuff you already have!” The important takeaway is this: item management is a core part of this game and you should expect to dedicate a solid chunk of time to flipping through different menus,&nbsp; sorting and making the most of what you have.</p> <p>And so I did. After trying to clear space (I spent about five minutes trying to rummage through stuff to see what I could use or get rid of), I just rolled out with what I had which included:</p>

Is a Night Raid a little overkill for such a simple item? Maybe. But I was curious to see what would be available at night.</p> <figure id="attachment_2000641441" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000641441"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000641441">© Screenshot: Embark Studios / Claire Jackson / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p>Turns out, the more minor POIs (the ones not surrounded by a yellow or red line on the map) were a little sparse. Loot or not, each area posed a challenge to my attention and awareness: I had to constantly ask myself whether a random sound I heard was a sign someone was nearby, possibly even sneaking up on me. I cautiously crawled through various buildings and eventually found my Rope. But then I ran into a tricky situation.</p>

 <h2>I just wanted Rope, now I’m running for my life</h2> <p>I took my time on the map. I was playing it safe. At night, with the world lit by sterile moonlight, it was very easy to see other people from a distance in open areas. In fact, I could see a few other Raiders far out on my perimeter. Every time I stopped to soak in the ambience, manage my loot, or observe an interesting potential sightline, however, I was reminded I was on borrowed time. Gunfire in the near distance meant I had to get moving. Fired shots means someone’s fighting to stay alive, and that’s a situation which could rope me in or result in collateral damage.</p> <p>But more than anything else, I had to get moving because I was running out of time. I’d placed the marker for the extraction point incorrectly on my map (silly me). Now I was trying to split my attention between staying out of sight and making decent time in my trip to extraction and before I knew it, I was on top of a building with just a minute-thirty left of game time (if you don’t extract in time, you die and lose everything). So I had to make a split-second decision: Do I risk jumping off the building? I wasn’t sure I’d even survive, and if I did, I might be left vulnerable to attacks from drones or other players.</p> <figure id="attachment_2000641482" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000641482"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000641482">© Gif: Embark Studios / Claire Jackson / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p>I took the leap of faith, which cost me about 70 percent of my health. I patched myself up quickly and <i>raced</i> to the extraction point, calling in the elevator with 20 seconds left on the clock while an explosion went off right near me and <a href="https://arcraiders.wiki/wiki/Rocketeer">a Rocketeer</a> hovered ominously nearby. Was it going to start something with me? I wasn’t sure. The clock ran out, but luck was with me, as it seems there’s a roughly 20-30 second grace period if you’ve called in the elevator.</p>

 <p>I made it out with a bag full of supplies including my Rope.</p> <h2>Finishing the quest</h2> <figure id="attachment_2000641458" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000641458"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000641458">© Gif: Embark Studios / Claire Jackson / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p>I did some more inventory management and loaded out to Buried City to finish the quest requiring the Zipline. This match included some tense battles with Arc machines and a spooky encounter with another player who wouldn’t communicate. I saw them through a slit in the wall but despite my attempts to say hi and ask them not to shoot, they were noncommunicative.</p> <p>I pushed forward on the quest, always watching my back for that other player. I didn’t know what they were up to, but if it wasn’t good, they were about to find out how good my battle rifle was. Or maybe I’d find out how much better their gun was. Who can say? That tension loomed over me for the rest of the quest.</p> <p>I did some more looting, covering my tracks with traps in case that other player turned out to be stalking me. Once again, I made it out with a sizeable bag of loot and had enough time for one more match. I was just shy of hitting a new level, so I hopped back in.</p> <h2>‘Don’t mess with me’</h2> <p>I loaded back into the same map as I had two new quests to take on. But within a few moments of deploying onto the field, some rando started firing at me.</p>

 <p>“Buddy,” I said out loud, “you don’t want to do this.” At this point I swapped out my Ferro IV for an <a href="https://arcraiders.wiki/wiki/Arpeggio">Arpeggio IV</a> (by the way, “Arpeggio” is a perfect name for a three-round burst weapon as three notes played in succession are the minimum you need to play an arpeggio on an instrument properly). It was fitted with a Muzzle Break and an improved magazine capacity. That meant my recoil was sufficiently under control and I had ammo to spare in any firefight.</p> <p>So while this fellow was assaulting me with what sounded like an underpowered gun compared to mine, I audibly said “don’t mess with me,” spun around and took them down with 10 quick pulls of the trigger. They were down but had nothing of value on them, which I’d expected.</p>

 <figure id="attachment_2000641462" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000641462"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000641462">© Gif: Embark Studios / Claire Jackson / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p>Hey, I warned them!</p> <p>I encountered another player while scouting the locations of my quests. This person didn’t open fire on me, but they also weren’t communicative. In <i>Arc Raiders</i>, the emote wheel is sufficient enough to establish some kind of truce. “Hey,” and “Don’t Shoot” are things any player can communicate with a few button presses.</p> <p>We teamed up silently, doing a bit of basic looting. My bag was full, so I took to watching over my “friend” both because they might need the help and, well, I wanted to make sure they remained “my friend” by never taking my eyes off of them. I did, however, gift them my Burletta as I had enough in my arsenal anyway.</p>

 <p>We came across an <a href="https://arcraiders.wiki/wiki/ARC_Surveyor">Arc Surveyor</a>. These little rolly things move fast and have a lot of armor. Kill them, though, and you’re bound to get some decent loot. We chased this thing around the map for a while before I landed the killing shot. We grabbed what we found and headed for extraction.</p> <p>The extraction point was near the pharmacy, so I decided to let my comrade leave the map while I did once last pass for possible decent loot. There were four minutes left and, hey, I found <a href="https://arcraiders.wiki/wiki/Rocketeer_Driver">a Rocketeer Driver</a>! These things can’t be used for offensive attacks, but they are an important crafting ingredient I needed to expand one of my workshops. I snagged it, raced on to the extraction point and got out, hitting level 39 in the process.</p> <p>While I didn’t end up finishing my quests, I did get a good sense of where those objectives were, so I don’t have to waste too much time finding out where I need to go and what I need to gather the next time I load into the game.</p> <p>And so my hour dedicated to <i>Arc Raiders</i> on this specific evening reached its close. I was overtime, in fact, by about 15 minutes. I purchased a new skill in the Mobility Tree, did a bit more inventory management, and that was my evening.</p>

 <hr> <p>My hour with <i>Arc Raiders</i> included some tense shootouts with enemy AI, a few encounters with other players that could’ve ended any which way, a single encounter with someone trying to push their luck, and a whole lot of loot to help me go on better runs.</p> <figure id="attachment_2000641461" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000641461"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000641461">© Screenshot: Embark Studios / Claire Jackson / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p>Stealth, tests of aiming, managing my time on the map, all of these are things I’ve loved in other third-person shooters, especially games like <i>The Last of Us</i> and any given <i>Metal Gear Solid</i>. But what I loved the most about this hour spent was how organic and spontaneous everything was. I now have a better sense of what loot is where, and can plan future missions accordingly. Plus, I got a better sense of how I can rely on my weaponry. I now know from experience how efficiently that Arpeggio IV works with the equipment I’d chosen to put on it. And if I die to someone and they take that gun, that gun becomes a part of their story; it could even end up being used against me. I don’t want that to happen.</p> <p>I think had I not been running solo, there might’ve been less stealth and I would’ve felt more comfortable about exploring the more dangerous areas of the map, which do promise greater loot. But either way, in an hour, I made some great progress on my weapon builds, unlocked a new ability, finished a quest, and had some interesting encounters with players and enemy AI. I’d say that’s time well spent.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><span>Sometimes mapping every real-world struggle onto whatever the current pop culture hotness is can feel exhaustingly cynical. Often this tendency manifests in statements and gestures that are, at their best, a bumper sticker tagline about how Republicans are a bunch of Dementors from </span><i><span>Harry Potter</span></i><span>, or at worst, </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/department-homeland-security-halo-ice-pokemon-video-dhs-2000639308"><span>literal fascist propaganda dressed in </span><i><span>Halo</span></i><span>’s imagery</span></a><span>. Even just yesterday, as we headed into election night, the official </span><a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@democrats/video/7568872873331297549?lang=en"><span>social media accounts of the Democratic party</span></a><span> were using </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/kpop-demon-hunters-best-worst-songs-soundtrack-ranking-2000616633"><span>my favorite song from </span><i><span>KPop Demon Hunters</span></i></a> <span>to paint </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/donald-trump-administration-white-house-halo-gamestop-2000639566"><span>President Donald Trump</span></a><span> as an agent of the evil, soul-eating demon Gwi-ma, and it gave me the ick. So when something like </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-legends-za-review-switch-2-bugs-performance-2000637719"><i><span>Pokémon Legends: Z-A</span></i></a> <span>actually seems to understand the moment in a deeper, more authentic way, it’s not only a welcome surprise, but it can be an incredibly poignant reminder that not all these stories are empty posturing.</span></p>  <p><span>In </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-legends-za-review-switch-2-bugs-performance-2000637719"><span>my </span><i><span>Pokémon Legends: Z-A</span></i><span> review</span></a><span>, I mentioned a moment that made me put my controller down and just stare at the ceiling, speechless and overcome with emotion. It was, admittedly, an inopportune time for me to have to take a break, as Lumiose City, the Paris-inspired metropolis that is the setting for the entire game’s adventure, was facing an apocalyptic threat in the form of a sentient rogue machine called Ange embedded in the city’s central tower. But I just needed a moment. I’m a sentimental person, and pretty much no other series activates all those flowery feelings in me like </span><i><span>Pokémon </span></i><span>does. </span><i><span>Legends: Z-A </span></i><span>is especially well-equipped to invoke them, and its finale had its sights set on me like a Gigantamaxed Intellion aiming down its scope.</span></p>

 <p><i><span>Legends: Z-A</span></i><span>’s singular setting has been a point of contention for some </span><i><span>Pokémon </span></i><span>fans. The series is typically defined by its regional pilgrimages that take the player through different cities and biomes in search of its many magical monsters, so putting an entire 30+ hour campaign in one city was already a big change. This isn’t helped by the fact that the map is kind of small and lacks the distinct districts that usually characterize a city. So, looking at it strictly as a video game setting, Lumiose City leaves a lot to be desired. However, what it does manage to capture better than probably any other game in the franchise is that a city is not just a place, it’s a people. Landmarks and attractions can lure anyone to a place like Lumiose for a visit, but it’s the citizens who make a city what it is.</span></p>

 <figure id="attachment_2000641435" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000641435"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000641435">© The Pokémon Company / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p><span>Because </span><i><span>Legends: Z-A </span></i><span>is set in one place, it’s better at cultivating a cast of characters than most </span><i><span>Pokémon </span></i><span>games get to be. Typically, you meet other trainers and gym leaders for a battle or two before you head out on your way to your next destination, but </span><i><span>Legends: Z-A</span></i><span>’s not-gym-leaders round out a team of absolute weirdos who would likely not interact at all in another </span><i><span>Pokémon </span></i><span>game. They come from different industries, backgrounds, and cultures, and you could imagine each of them as a figurehead of separate towns with their own eclectic visual motifs. Maybe Canari, the star streamer of Lumiose, and Jacinthe, the battle-obsessed socialite, could have passed by each other at a Kalos gala, but broadly, I can’t imagine most of these guys even being friends if it weren’t for their proximity, both geographically and to you, the player. You serve as the social glue linking a dozen or so disparate trainers that make a full-blown community by the time the game is over.</span></p>

 <p><span>Living in a dense city is pretty much living on top of people whom you might have otherwise never met. From the outside looking in, a place like Lumiose can seem like a chaotic rat race of people too distracted by their own bullshit to care about the person they see every morning on their commute. In </span><i><span>Legends: Z-A</span></i><span>, however, you see just how untrue that city stereotype is through characters like Corbeau, the leader of the Rust Syndicate, which is essentially </span><i><span>Pokémon</span></i><span>’s</span> <span>version of a French mob. He leads as an intimidating force who is seemingly extorting people like the player’s friend Taunie/Urbain, though as your team works off your debt, you’re not getting involved in heinous crimes, but instead in what is essentially forced public service, like helping the locals deal with problems in their homes or chasing off </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-legends-za-society-battle-connoisseurs-jacinthe-2000637284"><span>public menaces who are bothering local kids</span></a><span>. When he finally “forgives” your debt, he does so in a roundabout way by staying at your team’s hotel base of operations and leaving a “tip” of the remaining amount. Despite his scary demeanor, the guy’s a household name in Lumiose for wanting to do right by the people.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <figure id="attachment_2000637236" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000637236"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000637236">© The Pokémon Company / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p><span>These kinds of on-the-ground institutions rise over the years as corporate interests creep into a city and threaten to overtake it. </span><i><span>Legends: Z-A </span></i><span>grapples with the impact of this kind of corporate involvement throughout its main story, as the city’s new urban redevelopment plan to bring Pokémon and people together via new Wild Zones that house untamed monsters is orchestrated by a corporation called Quasartico Inc.&nbsp; The company enters the city ostensibly with good intentions, but the people of Lumiose don’t seem satisfied with this arrangement, and the ongoing destabilization of the city as new Wild Zones open begins to interfere with the people’s daily lives. By the time </span><i><span>Legends: Z-A </span></i><span>wraps up its main campaign, no one’s really sure if the city is going in the right direction, and there’s something really fascinating about watching the </span><i><span>Pokémon </span></i><span>universe grapple with the world it’s made, even if it doesn’t come to a definitive conclusion by the end of the story.</span></p>

 <p><span>Even within the language of an all-ages franchise, the seedier side of city living lingers over Lumiose. </span><i><span>Legends: Z-A </span></i><span>has anti-homeless benches scattered around its city, includes a few questlines that </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-legends-za-shuppet-quest-cop-police-officer-2000640501"><span>criticize the overbearing local police force</span></a><span>, and as the urban redevelopment plan unfolds, the citizens are either complaining about it or straight-up protesting it. The people are watching their city be gentrified, and they feel like they’re being pushed out by a corporation’s supposedly well-meaning changes. This is put on display by two characters, Grisham and Griselle, who were previously unnamed grunts for Team Flare in </span><i><span>Pokémon X </span></i><span>and </span><i><span>Y</span></i><span>, but have stayed in the city and evaded capture, despite their actions in the 3DS games. Nowadays, they run a cafe in the city, but they secretly consider themselves members of “Team Flare Nouveau,” a new iteration of the team that wants to make Lumiose better for the people in it, and they think they’re far more equipped to do so than the suits of Quasartico because they talk to the average citizen every day when they bring them one of their specialty coffees.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <figure id="attachment_2000641436" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000641436"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000641436">© The Pokémon Company / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p><span>One of the most effective segments in </span><i><span>Legends: Z-A </span></i><span>occurs when these two take you to the old remnants of their base from </span><i><span>X </span></i><span>and </span><i><span>Y</span></i><span>, lamenting that they’ve been ostracized from the community of Lumiose, but also have nowhere else to go because this is their home. Rather than simply rehashing the Team Flare story in </span><i><span>Legends: Z-A</span></i><span>, Game Freak chose to turn a remnant of one of its more forgettable villainous teams into a sad, moving echo of ordinary people being swayed by big promises their leaders make and fail to deliver on, typically in pursuit of their own selfish goals. Grisham and Griselle were sold a vision of a world that would help the Kalos region, and instead, all they got was a madman at its helm. So what are they to do? Make the most of it for the city they love.</span></p> <p><span>Most of the people you team up with in </span><i><span>Legends: Z-A</span></i><span>’s final hours shouldn’t be friends. In a lot of places in the </span><i><span>Pokémon </span></i><span>world, they likely would have never even met. So when the going gets tough and they band together, it shows that the heart of a city is the people who helped build it brick by brick. When it all goes to hell, these unlikely allies all gather around a giant piece of rubble to bicker and strategize how to defend their home. Everyone has something to contribute. Tarragon and his construction crew build a massive path with scaffolding to help you reach your objective, Jacinthe blocks the Rogue Pokemon attacking the city with her barrier tech, and Corbeau uses the might of the Rust Syndicate to…create a human ladder for you to climb (it’s actually a hilarious moment). Lastly, the leaders of Team Flare Nouveau defend you as you try to reach Zygarde, knowing that even if the people of Lumiose can’t forgive them for what they did all those years ago, they’ll protect the city or die trying.</span></p> <p><span>The only way that the people of Lumiose City can overcome this gargantuan threat is together, and god, it hits. It’s why I had to take a breather to just reflect. I </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/cyberpunk-2077-phantom-liberty-night-city-new-york-city-1850879791"><span>moved to New York City to write for </span><i><span>Kotaku </span></i><span>almost three years ago</span></a><span>, and as a queer man who grew up in the Bible Belt, there’s something disorienting about notions of community to me. I came from a place where most of the citizens would only rally around you if you checked specific boxes, and if you accepted that help under certain pretenses. Mutual aid often felt like it was conditional, and it often came with strings attached. I know if I asked a lot of the predominantly white, conservative people in that small town, they would say that wasn’t their experience. But many of them were so embedded in their insular circles that they didn’t recognize their hands weren’t extended equally if you were even slightly outside of their bounds.</span></p>

  <p><span>Last night, I attended my first election watch party since moving to the city, and after throwing my support behind new NYC mayor-elect Zohran Mamdani, I had been grinding my teeth all day in anticipation of the results. The event was full of so many people from different walks of life, with histories different but perhaps not too dissimilar from mine. Everyone was united in a common cause: to try and make the city more affordable for working-class people after years of escalating expenses pricing people out. In my 33 years, it was the first time I sat in a room waiting for an election result surrounded by people who all wanted the same things I did, and who did more than simply tolerate each other. When Mamdani’s victory was called, he gave an incredible speech that not only promised a future worth fighting for, but asserted that anyone who sought to disrupt that future, even Donald Trump’s fascist administration, would have to go through everyone in New York City. I was standing with my friends, many of whom had only come into my life after I’d uprooted it to be in this city, as we hooped, hollered, and cried, knowing that maybe, just maybe, things might be different tomorrow than they felt today.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>I know that </span><i><span>Pokémon Legends: Z-A</span></i><span>’s depiction of people who love their city coming together for the common good is possible because I’ve seen it. For a lot of my life, I’d felt like stories of disparate people coming together were purely idyllic or naive. But these days, I know better, because those stories are all around me.</span></p>

              <p>America’s most fashionable and fantastic pig, <a href="https://kotaku.com/the-muppets-were-always-adult-1724411134">Miss Piggy</a>, is finally getting what she has long deserved: Her very own feature film. It only took those in charge of <em>The Muppets</em> five decades.</p> <p><a href="https://deadline.com/2025/11/miss-piggy-movie-cole-escola-jennifer-lawrence-emma-stone-1236607843/">As spotted by <em>Deadline</em></a>, Jennifer Lawrence recently spilled the beans on a Miss Piggy movie that she and Emma Stone are producing and developing. The news was shared during an interview on Bowen Yang and Matt Rogers’ <em>Las Culturistas </em>podcast<em>.&nbsp;</em></p> <p>“I don’t know if I can announce this, but I’m just going to. Emma Stone and I are producing a Miss Piggy movie, and [Cole Escola] is writing it,” said <em>X-Men</em> and <em>Hunger Games</em> star Lawrence. The actor didn’t reveal any plot details during the interview, but when asked if she and Stone would appear in the film replied: “I think so, we have to.” Comedian and writer <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cole_Escola">Escola</a> has become a big sensation following the release of their hit Broadway play <em>Oh, Mary!&nbsp;</em></p>

 <p>Disney and The Jim Henson Company have yet to officially announce the <em>Muppets</em> spin-off movie starring Miss Piggy.</p> <p>If the movie actually happens, it would mark the character’s first solo outing since the famous pig debuted on <em>The Muppet Show</em> back in 1976. The Muppets franchise recently celebrated its 70-year anniversary. And in September, it was announced that Seth Rogen was leading the charge on a new <em>Muppet Show</em> reboot.</p> <p><a href="https://deadline.com/2025/09/the-muppet-show-disney-plus-seth-rogen-sabrina-carpenter-pilot-1236546510/">Meanwhile, <em>Deadline</em> reports</a> that Disney is working on a Sabrina Carpenter-led <em>Muppets</em> special that is set to air in 2026, just in time for the 50th anniversary of the original TV show.</p>
