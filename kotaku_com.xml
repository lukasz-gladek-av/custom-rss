Is it <em>Luigi’s Mansion</em>? <em>Super Mario Sunshine</em>?? <em>Fire Emblem: Path of Radiance</em>??? No, it’s <em>Super Mario Strikers</em>, the inaugural entry in Nintendo’s soccer franchise, arriving July 1. While that might be disappointing to some fans, diehard Strikers will rejoice that there’s finally a good one of those playable on modern hardware. </p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="196452" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="Clear Your Calendar For Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="149" data-playlist="196452,197567,197531" data-current="196452"><div><p>Clear Your Calendar For Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196452/196452_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196452/196452_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196452/196452_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196452/196452_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/22004.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>See, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/mario-strikers-battle-league-review-nintendo-switch-mul-1849047762&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/mario-strikers-battle-league-review-nintendo-switch-mul-1849047762">before<em> Mario Strikers: Battle League</em> came out in 2022</a></span>, long-time fans were cautiously optimistic. The GameCube original didn’t sell great, but won a loyal following thanks to its simple-but-fun spin on the beautiful game. <em>Mario Strikers</em> <em>Charged</em> for the Wii was decent as well, and depending on who you ask was a clear upgrade over the original, especially thanks to its online multiplayer. <em>Battle League</em>, on the other hand, just didn’t feel like it had the juice. It was light on content and the more strategic gameplay could be a bit soulless compared to the more arcade-y fun of the earlier games. </p><p>So it’s nice to see that <em>Super Mario Strikers</em> will now be playable on Switch 2 as well, improved by the Switch Online app’s multiplayer options with others on your friends list. We’ll see how the GameCube emulation holds up for it, but if <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/switch-2-online-gamecube-games-wind-waker-fzero-classic-1851774234&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/switch-2-online-gamecube-games-wind-waker-fzero-classic-1851774234">it’s anything like <em>The Legend of Zelda: Wind Waker</em></a></span>, <em>Mario Strikers</em> should also look and run better on the Switch 2 even though it’s not getting the full-blown remaster treatment. It’s also another reason to pick up Nintendo’s modern GameCube controller replica that released alongside the new console. </p><p>That accessory will come in handy once<em> Smash Bros. Melee </em>arrives. I mean, Nintendo has to be getting ready to bring that over too, right? (<em>Oh, Ethan...—Anti-Naivety Ed</em>) While <em>Super Mario Strikers</em> isn’t my personal pick for the fourth GameCube game to join the Switch 2's retro library, there are plenty of excellent games we should be getting now that Nintendo has a solution for porting them beyond individual remasters. That includes a bunch of other sports spin-offs. <em>Mario Superstar Baseball </em>when? And don’t forget about<em> Dance Dance Revolution: Mario Mix</em>. Maybe Nintendo will ship a new dance pad just in time for the holidays. </p><p>.</p></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://kotaku.com/switch-2-mario-strikers-gamecube-smash-bros-melee-1851785199]]></content:encoded>

I can confirm that the gestures do inflict damage when they hit a monster, but it’s a pretty negligible amount. They also all require real money to unlock. Here are the remaining items and how much they cost:</p><ul data-type="List" data-style="Bullet"><li><strong>SF6 Hadoken Gesture:</strong> $3.99</li><li><strong>SF6 Shoryuken Gesture:</strong> $3.99</li><li><strong>SF6 Tatsumaki Senpu-Kyaku Gesture:</strong> $3.99</li><li><strong>Street Fighter 6 Sticker Set:</strong> $1.99</li><li><strong>Blanka-Chan Doll Pendant:</strong> $1.49</li></ul><h2 id="h245753"><a id=""></a>How to Get SF6 Tickets</h2><figure id="" data-id="c4b0fbb1e6e5e500fcd30e94dcebd5a2" data-recommend-id="image://c4b0fbb1e6e5e500fcd30e94dcebd5a2" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The rewards screen for the Demonic Strength quest, highlighting the SF6 Ticket material." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="The rewards screen for the Demonic Strength quest, highlighting the SF6 Ticket material." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Capcom / Samuel Moreno / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="c4b0fbb1e6e5e500fcd30e94dcebd5a2" data-recommend-id="image://c4b0fbb1e6e5e500fcd30e94dcebd5a2" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The rewards screen for the Demonic Strength quest, highlighting the SF6 Ticket material." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Just like with the Blossomdance Festival event and the <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/monster-hunter-wilds-mh-mon-hun-arch-tempered-rey-dau-1851782762&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/monster-hunter-wilds-mh-mon-hun-arch-tempered-rey-dau-1851782762">Arch-Tempered Rey Dau</a></span> equipment, the new forgeable items from this collaboration require a new material. Appropriately, that material is called <em>SF6 </em>Ticket. <strong>The only way to get </strong><em><strong>SF6 </strong></em><strong>Tickets are as rewards from the Demonic Strength and True Strength Arena Quests.</strong> Both of these are unlocked as you complete the Ultimate Strength side mission in the Oilwell Basin. Akuma will give you the first of these after you find him in the small cave near the Area 14 Mining Cave Tent pop-up camp. You’ll unlock True Strength after finishing the side mission.</p><p>These Arena Quests are pretty similar. You’ll face off against a Tempered Ajarakan while wearing Akuma armor. Demonic Strength is a solo run against a three-star Ajarakan, while True Strength allows for two hunters to take on a five-star Ajarakan. Farming the easier Demonic Strength quest is the best way to get <em>SF6 </em>Tickets fast. I was able to breeze through it with A-rank speed and almost solely using the Akuma armor attacks.</p><p><strong>You need ten total <em>SF6 </em>Tickets to forge all the related items.</strong> The Akuma armor set requires five; the Blanka-Chan palico armor set requires two; and the new Mighty Charm III requires three. Keep in mind that any other required materials will have to be gathered from other hunts.</p><h2 id="h245754"><a id=""></a>How to play as Akuma</h2><figure id="" data-id="4831320cf7ef266a1ca21940d7c10052" data-recommend-id="image://4831320cf7ef266a1ca21940d7c10052" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The new Akuma tab in the Basic Controls menu lists out the benefits of wearing his full armor set." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="The new Akuma tab in the Basic Controls menu lists out the benefits of wearing his full armor set." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Capcom / Samuel Moreno / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="4831320cf7ef266a1ca21940d7c10052" data-recommend-id="image://4831320cf7ef266a1ca21940d7c10052" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The new Akuma tab in the Basic Controls menu lists out the benefits of wearing his full armor set." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Breaking the head of a <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/monster-hunter-wilds-mh-defeat-mizutsune-bubbles-temper-1851781466&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/monster-hunter-wilds-mh-defeat-mizutsune-bubbles-temper-1851781466">Mizutsune</a></span> with an uppercut is a satisfying experience, and you can live that dream too by wearing the Akuma armor. However, this unique mechanic sadly isn’t without some key downsides. You’ll be given the following three Item Bar options when you wear the Akuma armor set or use the Layered Armor version:</p><ul data-type="List" data-style="Bullet"><li><strong>Assisted Combo: Akuma</strong>: Leaving your Item Bar centered over this option is how you gain access to most of the fighter’s moves. You always have to press Square/X to begin Assisted Combo 1, but you can then switch over to Triangle/Y or Circle/B for Assisted Combos 2 and 3. Pressing X/A during a combo will change your roll into an Ashura Senku teleport</li><li><strong>Gou Hadoken</strong>: Equipping this provides you with a special Hadoken projectile that functions like Slinger ammo</li><li><strong>Drive Impact</strong>: This action only works if the green six-bar Drive Gauge above the Item Bar is full. Landing a Drive Impact against a monster’s wound will destroy it with a Shun Goku Satsu. Drive Impact can also gain <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/monster-hunter-wilds-offset-attack-monster-weapons-1851775743&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/monster-hunter-wilds-offset-attack-monster-weapons-1851775743">Offset Attack</a></span> priorities if the full Akuma armor is equipped</li></ul><p>Additionally, Akuma armor allows the use of the Gou Shoryuken gesture that’s awarded after completing the Ultimate Strength side mission. This gesture inflicts a bit more damage than the paid ones, but more importantly, it enhances into an OD Gou Shoryuken when performed after a combo.</p><p>I can’t deny that this sounds awkward and overly complicated. The trick is to make use of the various button shortcuts. Although assigning these actions to a Radial Menu is great for quicker access, relying on the following button shortcuts will allow you to fight with only the Assisted Combo option equipped:</p><ul data-type="List" data-style="Bullet"><li><strong>Drive Impact Shortcut:</strong> Activated with a Focus Strike input (L2+R1/LT+RB) during an Assisted Combo</li><li><strong>Raging Demon Shortcut:</strong> An offshoot of his Drive Impact that you can cancel animations into and begins with an Ashura Senku teleport. Activated by <em>very quickly</em> pressing Square, Square, Triangle+Circle or X, X, Y+B</li><li><strong>OD Gou Shoryuken:</strong> Activated during or after combos by inputting right, down, right, and then any of the attack buttons. Those directional inputs have to be done with the stick and not a Directional pad.</li></ul><p>Many of Akuma’s attacks are short-range with limited movement. His iconic hurricane kick is ideal for repositioning, which is performed by pressing Circle/B three times for a full Assisted Combo 3 string. <strong>Akuma’s best combo connects the entire strings from all three of his Assisted Combos.</strong> That means pressing Square/X three times, Triangle/Y three times, and then Circle/B three times. Throwing out an OD Gou Shoryuken is a nice way to round it out. This should be the go-to when monsters are knocked down, since they won’t be able to interrupt you.</p><p>All of the above covers Akuma’s actions, but it means nothing without a good base. All of his techniques scale with your primary weapon’s raw damage and affinity. Equipping something with significant base damage will result in stronger Akuma attacks. Armor selection also makes a difference. <strong>Compared to Layered armor, having the full Akuma armor equipped provides a big attack boost, stun properties, and the Offset Effect for Drive Impact.</strong> You should use the full armor if you want all of his tools at your disposal.</p><p>Even though Akuma was also featured in the previous game, his inclusion in <em>Wilds</em> is a lot more fleshed out. Here’s hoping the next collaborations are just as deep and feature crossovers with some fun franchises.</p><p>Or Capcom could just make me happier and throw in some love for <em>Dragon’s Dogma 2</em>.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://kotaku.com/monster-hunter-wilds-street-fighter-6-sf6-ticket-akuma-1851785172]]></content:encoded>
