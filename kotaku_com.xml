              <p>Larian Studios is experimenting <a href="https://kotaku.com/larian-studios-gen-ai-divinity-bg3-2000653850">with generative AI</a> and fans aren’t too happy. The head of the <em>Baldur’s Gate 3</em> maker, Swen Vincke, released a new statement to try to explain the studio’s stance in more detail and make clear the controversial tech isn’t being used to cut jobs. “Any [Machine Learning] tool used well is additive to a creative team or individual’s workflow, not a replacement for their skill or craft,” he said.</p> <p>He was responding to a backlash that arose earlier today from <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2025-12-16/-baldur-s-gate-3-maker-promises-divinity-will-be-next-level">a <em>Bloomberg</em> interview</a> which reported that Larian was moving forward with gen AI despite some internal concerns among staff. Vincke made clear the tech was only being used for things like placeholder text, PowerPoint presentations, and early concept art experiments and that nothing AI-generated would be included in Larian’s upcoming RPG, <a href="https://kotaku.com/divinity-turn-based-rpg-larian-studios-early-access-date-2000653845"><em>Divinity</em></a>.</p>

 <p>The reaction on social media was swift. “Don’t mind me, currently living through my personal 9/11,” <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/okbuddybaldur/comments/1po65yn/dont_mind_me_currently_living_through_my_personal/">wrote</a> one fan on Reddit. “Consider my feedback: I loved working at Larian until AI,” <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/anoxicart.bsky.social/post/3ma4kiiuu5s2g">wrote</a> an artist who worked on <em>BG3</em>. “reconsider and change your direction, like, yesterday. show your employees some respect. they are world-class &amp; do not need AI assistance to come up with amazing ideas.”</p>

 <p>Vincke has since tried to address those concerns in a <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/larian-ceo-responds-to-divinity-gen-ai-backlash-we-are-neither-releasing-a-game-with-any-ai-components-nor-are-we-looking-at-trimming-down-teams-to-replace-them-with-ai">long statement sent to <em>IGN</em></a>:</p> <blockquote><p>We’ve been continuously increasing our pool of concept artists, writers and story-tellers, are actively putting together writer rooms, casting and recording performances from actors and hiring translators.</p></blockquote> <blockquote><p>Since concept art is being called out explicitly – we have 23 concept artists and have job openings for more. These artists are creating concept art day in day out for ideation and production use.</p></blockquote> <blockquote><p>Everything we do is incremental and aimed at having people spend more time creating.</p></blockquote> <blockquote><p>Any ML tool used well is additive to a creative team or individual’s workflow, not a replacement for their skill or craft.</p></blockquote> <blockquote><p>We are researching and understanding the cutting edge of ML as a toolset for creatives to use and see how it can make their day-to-day lives easier, which will let us make better games.</p></blockquote> <blockquote><p>We are neither releasing a game with any AI components, nor are we looking at trimming down teams to replace them with AI.</p></blockquote> <blockquote><p>While I understand it’s a subject that invokes a lot of emotion, it’s something we are constantly discussing internally through the lens of making everyone’s working day better, not worse.</p></blockquote> <p>The studio head reiterates that Larian is hiring more artists, not fewer, and that it’s bulking up its creative resources for its upcoming game, not trying to cut corners with AI. There won’t be AI in <em>Divinity</em>, Vincke has promised, and the aim is to help employees, not force the tech on them as some publishers like EA <a href="https://kotaku.com/nhl26-ai-ea-college-football-madden-card-packs-2000646229">have reportedly been doing</a>.</p> <p>But the statement doesn’t necessarily address deeper divisions over generative AI tools, which many have likened to being plagiarism machines, and the skepticism that’s bound to arise from letting it near game development at all. “Early Access and the way they managed their community across all their updates helped humanize that team in ways that only helped <em>Baldur’s Gate 3</em>, weird for the studio to be so willing to throw all that goodwill away,” <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/jeffgerstmann.com/post/3ma4izugsds24">wrote</a> former<em> Giant Bomb</em> host Jeff Gerstmann.</p>

              <p>Is <em>Final Fantasy VII Remake</em> running at 30fps on Switch 2 disappointing or good enough? Is the Game Awards bump really worth an estimated $12 million in new sales? And just how long will fans have to wait for <em>Terminator: Survivors</em> to come out of its self-imposed indefinite delay? It’s the latest edition of <a href="https://kotaku.com/tag/morning-checkpoint">Morning Checkpoint</a>, <em>Kotaku</em>‘s daily roundup of gaming news and culture.</p> <p>We’re just beginning to wrap up our year-in-review coverage here, but my heart is already looking past the upcoming holidays to my favorite time of year: backlog season. I’m making a list, checking it twice<!--StartFragment --><span>—am I </span><!--EndFragment -->gonna maybe finally finish <em>System Shock 2</em> and not just replay <em>Xenogears</em> again?</p>

 <h2><em>Terminator: Survivors</em> is barely hanging on</h2> <p>With just two weeks left to go until it was supposed to release, Nacon’s post-apocalyptic adaptation of the franchise won’t be making its planned 2025 launch after all. Instead of getting a new ship date, however, the open-world game has been indefinitely delayed. It also won’t be launching with the previously promised co-op mode. There won’t be an Early Access phase either.</p>

 <p>“After months of internal testing, discussions with players and fans of the license, we came to the conclusion that to give you an authentic “<em>Terminator</em>” experience with the best possible shooting and exploration gameplay,&nbsp;we would have to put aside the&nbsp;cooperative multiplayer,” the publisher <a href="https://x.com/SurviveTheT800/status/2000959289918132344">announced on Tuesday</a>. “We know this may come as a disappointment, but we believe it is the right creative direction for an uncompromising vision of the world after Judgment Day.”</p>

 <h2>Nintendo shareholders are worried about spiking memory costs</h2> <p>That big <a href="https://kotaku.com/amd-gpu-prices-radeon-ps5-xbox-steam-machine-2000645803">RAM shortage</a> everyone keeps talking about? Investors are worried it’s about to hit the Switch 2 in a big way. <em>Bloomberg</em> reported that the cost of manufacturing the new console could already be going up. “The price Nintendo has to pay for the 12GB RAM (random access memory) modules in the Switch 2 jumped 41 percent in the current quarter, according to market intelligence firm TrendForce,” <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-12-10/nintendo-sheds-14-billion-value-after-chip-squeeze-fears-grow">it writes</a>.</p>

 <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/xbox-series-prices-dram-amd-ai-shortage-2000646851">Why is this happening</a>? Why, the <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/mrmunchertoyou.bsky.social/post/3m7zmn5hnkg2b">AI bubble of course</a>.</p> <h2>Players are flocking to<em> Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</em> all over again</h2>   <p>A Game Awards sweep, a big free update have, and a small sale on Steam have conspired to catapult the French RPG back up the charts.&nbsp;<a href="https://bsky.app/profile/superhys.bsky.social/post/3ma23xntiwk2v">Alinea Analytics estimates</a> that the game has sold another 300,000 copies since the showcase last week. Old players <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/matpiscatella.bsky.social/post/3m7zxuzbclk2f">are coming back too</a>. The Game Awards bump <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/moomanibe.bsky.social/post/3ma2ks7sx7s2a">remains very real</a>, at least for games that everyone already loved.</p>

 <h2><em>Final Fantasy 7 Remake</em> has a free demo on Switch 2</h2> <p>The port includes the <em>Intergrade</em> expansion and arrives on Nintendo’s new console on January 22, 2026. Progress from the demo will carry over to the main game. It runs smoothly, though some fans are disappointed it’s locked at 30fps despite the slight visual downgrade. <a href="https://kotaku.com/ff7-switch-2-remake-framerate-final-fantasy-2000622094">I played the opening earlier this year</a> and thought it looked surprisingly great in handheld mode.</p>

 <h2>The Amazon-funded MOBA studio founded by ex-Ubisoft devs has been sold back to Ubisoft</h2>  <p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zn2aJ3UmVnk"><em>March of Giants</em></a> was revealed earlier this year. It’s led by creative director Xavier Marquis, the original creative director of <em>Tom Clancy’s Rainbow Six Siege</em>, and producer Alexandre Parizeau, the previous managing director of Ubisoft Toronto. <a href="https://news.ubisoft.com/en-us/article/6TYgLsRkVYP97hVH0Rhzn7/ubisoft-acquires-march-of-giants-from-amazon">Amazon divested them back to Ubisoft</a> amid its latest round of big gaming cuts. Is this like a life raft seeking shelter aboard the Titanic?</p> <h2><em>Dota 2</em> gets its 128th hero: a frog who plays the mandolin</h2> <p>Largo was just added to Valve’s long-running MOBA in its mammoth <a href="https://www.dota2.com/largo">7.40 update</a>. The most important part? He has a rhythm-based ultimate called Amphibian Rhapsody. “Every time he strums successfully, he gains a stack of Groovin,'” the description reads. “Each stack gives him bonus armor and reduces the mana cost of every song, but he loses a stack if he misses a beat. Stacks linger for a short duration when Largo’s song ends.”</p> <p>Neat! Will this get me to go back to <em>Dota</em> after a multi-year break? Absolutely not.</p> <h2>ICYMI:</h2> <ul> <li><a href="https://kotaku.com/tomb-raider-catalyst-legacy-atlantis-remake-amazon-show-2000653453"><em>Tomb Raider</em> devs explain where the franchise goes next</a></li> <li><a href="https://kotaku.com/snl-ai-slop-saturday-night-live-nbc-2000653399">SNL embraces the slop machine</a></li> <li><a href="https://kotaku.com/terminator-2d-no-fate-review-steam-switch-ps5-2000653418"><em>Terminator 2D: No Fate</em> is the best arcade action game of the year</a></li> </ul> <h2>Watch this:</h2>

            <title><![CDATA[Fans Are Hunting For A Dispatch Secret No One Has Found Yet]]></title>

              <p><span>When you finish </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/dispatch-adhoc-studios-interview-sales-2-million-humor-2000646848"><i><span>Dispatch</span></i></a><span>, AdHoc’s episodic adventure game will try to sum up your playthrough, Spotify Wrapped style. My version of protagonist Robert Robertson III was summed up as an unpredictable “everyman” who kept everyone guessing. There are a number of these potential descriptors you can receive, and apparently, even a month after the game’s finale was released, there’s one that no player has yet obtained. AdHoc is starting to get concerned that it could be a bug.</span></p> <p><span>In an interview with </span><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dispatch-dev-adhoc-says-theres-one-super-rare-game-state-no-ones-gotten-yet"><i><span>Eurogamer</span></i></a><span>, AdHoc co-founder Nick Herman explained that while many players have received three of the potential personality summaries, there is a fourth that’s “really hard to get.” So hard, in fact, that according to the studio’s in-house stats, no one has actually unlocked it yet.</span></p>

 <p><span>“It’s based on gameplay performance,” Herman explained to </span><i><span>Eurogamer</span></i><span>. “Have you perfected the game, essentially, is what that is. I don’t know that anyone’s done that.”&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>“We focused it on the non-RNG elements.”</span></p> <p><span>So you might need to pull off a perfect run of the game’s dispatching mechanics, succeeding in every job and leaving none of them incomplete. You may also need to </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/dispatch-episode-5-bar-fight-scene-making-of-song-prism-2000647373"><span>hit every QTE in the action sequences</span></a><span>. However, with guides, this is probably doable at this point, so Herman is starting to worry that it might actually be a bug that’s keeping players from seeing this fourth personality summary.</span></p>

 <p><span>“It might just be a bug,” Herman added. “It’s so hard to do regardless that we were like, ‘Well of course no one’s gotten it,’ but it’s probably a bug.”</span></p> <p><span>While Herman doesn’t call it by name, fans have </span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/DispatchAdHoc/comments/1p07oj2/robert_true_hero_antihero_everyman_endings_and/"><span>found references to a “Tactician” personality card</span></a><span> in the game’s files, but nobody has been able to determine how to unlock it, and some </span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/DispatchAdHoc/comments/1ow0lu2/scrapped_end_thing/"><span>even assumed it was just a leftover from a scrapped ending</span></a><span>. Given the title, it would make sense if this were the one you unlocked by having a “perfect” run of the game’s dispatch mechanics, skillfully sending out your crew of reformed ex-villains on the right jobs and beating up baddies in the few instances in which you get to head out into the field yourself. Maybe AdHoc needs to check under the hood and see why no one’s unlocked this yet.</span></p> <p><span>For more on</span><i><span> Dispatch</span></i><span>, check out </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/dispatch-review-adhoc-studios-all-8-episodes-finale-2000644106"><i><span>Kotaku</span></i><span>’s review</span></a><span>.</span></p>
