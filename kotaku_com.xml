And now even anime is threatened by the administration’s ongoing trade war. Trump recently threatened 100 percent tariffs on all foreign-made movies like <em>Avengers: Doomsday</em> and <em>Chainsaw Man</em>, resulting in two familiar reactions: “What the heck?!” and “Oh no.”</p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="194664" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="Disney's New Post-Apocalyptic Anime Proves The Mouse Has Good Taste" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="162" data-playlist="194664,194741,197551" data-current="194664"><div><p>Disney's New Post-Apocalyptic Anime Proves The Mouse Has Good Taste</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/194664/194664_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/194664/194664_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/194664/194664_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/194664/194664_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/20130.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>“The Movie Industry in America is DYING a very fast death,” Trump <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://truthsocial.com/@realDonaldTrump/posts/114452117143235155&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://truthsocial.com/@realDonaldTrump/posts/114452117143235155" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">posted on social media on Sunday</a></span>. He blamed other countries for offering financial incentives encouraging productions to film overseas and called it a national security threat.</p><p>“Therefore, I am authorizing the Department of Commerce, and the United States Trade Representative, to immediately begin the process of instituting a 100% Tariff on any and all Movies coming into our Country that are produced in Foreign Lands,” he wrote. “WE WANT MOVIES MADE IN AMERICA, AGAIN!”</p><p>Uh, how would that work? Imports are normally taxed at ports of entry based on the prices of the goods. How would that apply to movies distributed at the box office and over streaming platforms? Nobody seems quite sure, and like lots of half-cocked plans fired off on social media, this could be another Trump nothing burger.

Disney, Warner Bros. Discovery, Paramount, and other entertainment companies saw their stock prices go down on Monday. The policy as outlined would also hit anime. This year alone sees the releases of <em>Mobile Suit Gundam GQuuuuuuX: Beginning</em>, <em>Demon Slayer: Kimetsu no Yaiba Infinity Castle</em>, and <em>Chainsaw Man – The Movie: Reze Arc</em> in theaters, as well as re-releases of several older movies like <em>Spirited Away</em>. </p><p>“Japanese films, such as those by Studio Ghibli, directed by Hayao Miyazaki, are also popular in the U.S. If Trump imposes film tariffs, it will limit Americans’ opportunities to see these foreign films,” <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://mainichi.jp/articles/20250505/k00/00m/030/067000c&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://mainichi.jp/articles/20250505/k00/00m/030/067000c" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">one Japanese media outlet reported today</a></span>.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://kotaku.com/sinners-not-that-scary-1851779099<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><figure id="" data-id="6072b7f0ef26c7fed9c2a63e051cfedd" data-recommend-id="image://6072b7f0ef26c7fed9c2a63e051cfedd" data-format="png" data-width="2004" data-height="1022" data-lightbox="false" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Universal Pictures, FX</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="6072b7f0ef26c7fed9c2a63e051cfedd" data-recommend-id="image://6072b7f0ef26c7fed9c2a63e051cfedd" data-format="png" data-width="2004" data-height="1022" data-lightbox="false" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>If you missed the chance to watch Sinners in IMAX, don’t worry! Due to the film’s popularity, it will be re-released in IMAX from May 15th until May 21st, but until then, we have created a list of films and shows that you can watch if you still need a bit of a horror or southern gothic stories in your life. In this list, you will definitely find something to keep you entertained and maybe a little bit spooked!</p><p><em>This story originally appeared on The Root, our sister site, on Sunday, May 4.</em></p></div></div><div><p>If you want more Black vampires, then Blacula might be the film for you. Dracula [Charles Macaulay] turns an African prince, Prince Mamuwalde [William Marshall], into a vampire and traps him in a coffin. But chaos ensues when Prince Mamuwalde wakes up two centuries later and winds up in 1970s LA.</p></div><div><p>Jordan Peele’s first film “Get Out,” is a movie that will have you clutching at your pearls! Chris [Daniel Kaluuya] is an African-American man dating a white woman, Rose [Allison Williams]. Things start to take a spine-chilling turn when he goes to meet her creepy family for the first time.</p></div><div><p>This 2008 drama is not very Black, though the series had memorial black characters and is filled with Vampires. In this show, Vampires struggle for equal rights to live amongst non-vampires, while anti-vampire organizations grow in popularity. So, what happens when Sookie Stackhouse [Anna Paquin] falls in love with a 174-year-old vampire and has to deal with the difficulties of their relationship?</p></div><div><p>Interview With The Vampire is centered around the life of Louis de Pointe du Lac [Jacob Anderson] as he recounts his life story to journalist Daniel Molloy [Eric Bogosian]. The show based on a popular book by Anne Rice  is spooky, sexy, and intense. </p></div><div><p>Based on the Octavia Butler novel, Kindred follows Dana [Mallori Johnson] who gets pulled back in time to a nineteenth-century plantation where she is summoned to save Rufus, [David Alexander Kaplan] the white son of the plantation owner. The series follows Dana as she tries to understand what is happening to her and why.</p></div><div><p>If you like the idea of horror mixed with religion then Midnight Mass might be what you’re looking for. After a charismatic young priest shakes up the life of an isolated community, frightening events begin to occur. This film will have you on the edge of your seat.</p></div><div><p>Based on the Stephen King novel, Salem’s Lot follows Ben Mears [Lewis Pullman] on his return to his childhood home as he looks for inspiration for his next book, but what he discovers is much spookier than he could’ve imagined.</p></div><div><p>On the run from the police, brothers Richard Gecko [Quentin Tarantino] and Seth Gecko [George Clooney] film themselves running into a gang of vampires who are out for blood!</p></div><div><p>In this spine-chilling series, a plague starts to spread across humanity that leaves people acting like vampires. Dr Ephraim Goodweather [Corey Stoll] is called to investigate what is happening and figure out how to stop it.</p></div><div><p>Eve [Jurnee Smollet] finds out that her perfect father is hiding illicit affairs. After growing increasingly frustrated with her father’s actions, Eve seeks out a voodoo curse to be set on her father. The film is very spiritual and heartbreaking as you watch the hardships of this Creole-American family.</p></div><div><p>According to an interview <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.instagram.com/reel/DIiSKyTpdv3/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.instagram.com/reel/DIiSKyTpdv3/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Coogler did with Proximity Media</a></span>, “The Thing” was one of the films that inspired the way Sinners was shot. Coogler even has a poster of the film in his office. This 80's sci-fi horror follows a group of researchers in Antarctica as they deal with an alien that takes on the form of its victims.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
