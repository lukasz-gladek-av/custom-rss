              <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/borderlands-4-everything-pre-order-dlc-release-date-time-ps5-switch-2-crossplay-2000624090"><em>Borderlands 4</em></a> launched last week to big numbers and mostly positive reviews on Steam. But there’s been a lot of chatter and debate online about the looter shooter’s performance. Some players aren’t happy that <em>Borderlands 4</em> seemingly requires DLSS and frame generation to run decently, even on the highest-end hardware. Meanwhile, Gearbox co-founder and <a href="https://kotaku.com/borderlands-4-randy-pitchford-gearbox-80-real-fan-post-1851782855">CEO Randy Pitchford</a> has defended the game’s performance, calling it “<a href="https://x.com/DuvalMagic/status/1967424828975255865">pretty damn optimal</a>,” and suggested people need to use the “tools” provided by the studio and accept some trade-offs.</p> <p>On PC, many games can utilize real-time upscaling tech, like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deep_Learning_Super_Sampling">Nvidia’s DLSS</a> and AMD’s FSR. Nvidia and others have also created tools that allow your GPU to fill in the gaps between real frames rendered by the game with frames generated using deep learning tech. When this kind of tech was first introduced about six years ago or so, players complained that DLSS and other tools made games look blurry, even if it led to some performance boosts. As DLSS and similar tech have improved, the images produced looked have better and better. Today, DLSS 4.0 can produce some truly sharp-looking frames and provide some big performance gains, assuming you have a powerful enough video card.</p> <p>But some, myself included, have started to grow concerned that studios are building games around DLSS and other similar tech, and aren’t optimizing them in the way devs did in the past. When DLSS was introduced, it felt like a great tool for gamers who had a slightly older card but still wanted to play a newer game. It would let them squeeze out a bit more performance without shelling out for a pricey upgrade. Now it seems like newer games running on more advanced engines require users to turn on DLSS and frame gen to play. And so enters <em>Borderlands 4,</em> a game that has found itself at the center of this heated debate.</p>

 <p>Shortly after <em>Borderlands 4</em> launched, players on PC began to complain that the game didn’t run very well. Gearbox responded with some updates that, at least in my experience with the game on PC, helped a bit. <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1285190?emclan=103582791474679148&amp;emgid=679602429802577921">The company also released a guide from Nvidia</a> for how to optimize the game based on your GPU and settings. And while that helped some reach better performance on PC, many others, myself included, were struggling to get the game to run well on powerful hardware. I’m rocking a 5080, and even playing the game at 1080p on medium settings led to tons of FPS drops, even while trying to play at 60FPS. That all changed when I did as Gearbox and Nvidia suggest and turned on DLSS and frame gen. Now, I can run <em>Borderlands 4</em> at a mostly locked 120 with most settings set to high and medium. It looks nice and plays fine, but many aren’t okay with a game in 2025 being unable to run on high-end hardware without some upscaling assistance.</p> <p>Not helping matters is the fact that Randy Pitchford posted, <a href="https://x.com/DuvalMagic/status/1967424826697781446">as part of a recent and lengthy thread on Twitter</a>, that people should use DLSS because it’s “great” and added: <a href="https://x.com/DuvalMagic/status/1967424849653236055">“The game was built to take advantage of it.”</a> That, and a different part of the thread claiming it was acceptable for devs to focus on “default settings” reaching only 30FPS, didn’t go over well with a lot of PC gamers who specifically buy new parts and upgrade their rigs to achieve high framerates at high resolutions. For many, Pitchford’s claim that <em>Borderlands 4</em> was developed to “take advantage” of DLSS was him confirming that it was built with the assumption that most users would use DLSS. And that, to some, sounds a lot like the game wasn’t properly optimized to run without help from DLSS and frame generation.</p>

 <p>While I do agree that newer DLSS and frame gen tools are powerful and impressive, it feels weird that<em> Borderlands 4,</em> along with other games like <em>Alan Wake 2</em>, demand that even users with the highest-end hardware lean on upscaling tech to play at decent settings and historically popular framerates like 120. In a recent video, the tech experts over at <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/tech-experts-say-borderlands-4-on-pc-runs-worse-than-usual-for-an-unreal-engine-5-game-advise-against-badass-setting"><em>Digital Foundry</em> weren’t impressed with <em>Borderlands 4</em></a> on PC, with one even saying: “[<em>Borderlands 4</em>] does seem to be running worse than usual for an Unreal Engine 5 game. It is below where it seems like it should be given how other games using this engine perform.”</p> <p>Pitchford has promised on Twitter that more updates are coming, including some more improvements to how the game runs on PC. He’s also been spending a lot of time online <a href="https://x.com/DuvalMagic/status/1967351908613665255">helping people improve how <em>Borderlands 4</em> runs</a> and <a href="https://x.com/DuvalMagic/status/1967344224728400187">claiming that performance issues are not as widespread</a> as some might make you believe. Personally, I just miss when games could run on a high-end computer packed with powerful hardware without needing four different upscaling tools. <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/app/2246340/discussions/0/597391905481847754/?l=portuguese&amp;ctp=6">And it seems I’m not alone</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><i>Silksong</i> spent seven long years in development. While developer Team Cherry spent cooking up the wildly anticipated sequel, it also met with Seth Goldman, a fan who was battling cancer in 2020. After meeting with him, Team Cherry promised to include a character of Seth’s own design, directly named after him. Seth unfortunately lost his battle with cancer, but his memory lives on in <i>Silksong</i>. Now that the game is finally out, players have sought out and encountered Seth, <a href="https://hollowknight.fandom.com/wiki/Seth">immortalized as a boss</a> awaiting players in a hidden area.</p> <p>Taking to Reddit six years ago, user big_boi878, or <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/HollowKnight/comments/ftoylt/i_made_a_character_for_silksong/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button">Seth, announced</a> that after meeting Team Cherry thanks to the <a href="https://martylyonsfoundation.org/">Marty Lyons Foundation</a>, a character of his own design would end up in the game. “He’s really cool and has a boss fight,” Seth Goldman wrote six years ago.“I named him after myself (Seth) […] I can’t wait for you to see him, and see his cool lore and design and gameplay.”</p>  <p>Seth, the <i>Silksong </i>boss, appears in a hidden area in Grand Gate. Hopefully by this point in the game, you’ll be furiously attacking all walls you come across to discover secret areas. This particular one is found after a trip up an elevator shaft in Grand Gate, where you’ll find a smashable wall on the left at the top. You can check out <a href="https://youtu.be/131EHJhMV70">the boss battle with Seth here</a>.</p>   <p>Upon release of the game, <i>Hollow Knight</i> fans took to social media to mourn the loss of Seth while celebrating the game’s eventual release. “I wish so badly that we could play <i>Silksong</i> together,” <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Silksong/comments/1n5jysg/we_made_it_seth/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button">reads a post</a> from one user who considers Seth the reason they became a <i>Hollow Knight </i>fan, “but I’m glad you’ll still be there in some form.”</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/office-spin-off-first-look-the-paper-nbc-peacock-teaser-1851780331"><i><span>The Paper</span></i></a><span>, the new spin-off of </span><i><span>The Office</span></i><span> that’s streaming now on Peacock, will probably be pretty funny to the average viewer. To a journalist who has lived through everything the profession has suffered over the past 20 years or so, the workplace mockumentary is a cathartic encapsulation of so much of the nonsense I’ve never been able to explain to my friends and family who don’t work in the field. </span><i><span>The Paper</span></i><span>’s 10-episode season portrays the trials and tribulations that come with working in journalism in 2025, whether that be on a local level like the volunteer reporters of the fictional </span><i><span>Toledo Truth Teller</span></i><span> or on a larger scale, and the show does it with a surprising level of care, sympathy, and advocacy for the important work people are trying to do in impossible circumstances that threaten to undermine them at every turn.</span></p> <p><span>Admittedly, I was pretty skeptical coming into </span><i><span>The Paper</span></i><span>, not because I didn’t love </span><i><span>The Office</span></i><span> or because I had my doubts about how it would handle its too-close-to-home subject matter, but because all the </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/the-office-paper-trailer-peacock-release-date-oscar-2000616348"><span>early promo trailers</span></a><span> did nothing for me. They didn’t really have jokes and seemed to be largely </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/the-paper-office-spin-off-clip-video-trailer-peacock-2000620768"><span>banking on nostalgia for the original series</span></a><span> to draw people in. If nothing else, that’s made the fact that </span><i><span>The Paper</span></i><span> is pretty great a pleasant surprise.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><i><span>The Paper </span></i><span>picks up a few years after </span><i><span>The Office</span></i><span>. Dunder Mifflin, the paper supply company that the original series documented, has shut down, and the documentary filmmakers who followed its workplace antics are looking for a new subject. They end up in the office of the </span><i><span>Toledo Truth Teller</span></i><span>, a local newspaper that has been so underfunded that its output is primarily news pulled from </span><i><span>AP</span></i><span>, mind-numbing listicles, and clickbait non-stories. New editor-in-chief Ned Sampson (Domhnall Gleeson) has left his cozy life in sales behind to try to revive the legacy paper, only to find that he’s dealing with every roadblock the modern journalist faces when trying to do the work.</span></p>

 <figure id="attachment_2000625767" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000625767"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000625767">© Peacock</figcaption></figure> <p><span>The </span><i><span>Truth Teller </span></i><span>has lost almost all of its institutional knowledge, has no real funding to build itself back up, and is under the ownership of a larger corporation that has nothing to do with journalism. In fact, its owners only stand to see their position jeopardized if the publication digs a little deeper into the company’s own business practices. Nevertheless, Sampson is determined to make it work and relies on a small team of incredibly green, volunteer reporters to get things moving. Gee, that sure sounds like every media company, big and small, right now, huh?</span></p> <p><span>I have worked in journalism both on a local level at my small-town Georgia newspaper and at sites read by millions like </span><i><span>Kotaku</span></i><span>, and watching </span><i><span>The Paper </span></i><span>was like reliving 10 lives over the course of 10 episodes. The show succinctly sums up all the hurdles getting in the way of good journalism in 2025 in a way that would be kind of horrifying if it weren’t delivered in the hilarious deadpan so synonymous with </span><i><span>The Office</span></i><span>. Ned and his team face underfunding, corporate sabotage, and a need to also grind out stomach-turning churnalism to help keep the lights on. Trying to do reporting that is both helpful to the public and clears a baseline ethical threshold is a never-ending struggle when the odds are stacked against you. Nearly every episode of </span><i><span>The Paper </span></i><span>touches on some very real challenges journalists are dealing with as they just try to do their jobs in the modern media landscape, and I was truly pleased with how true-to-life it felt, even when taking things to their most absurdist extreme.</span></p>

 <p><i><span>The Office </span></i><span>was always at its best when it exaggerated mundane office drama into its most comical, awkward, and uncomfortable end stages, but focusing on a sales team, especially one selling something as unremarkable as paper, gave it a universal appeal. The show is less about the specifics of the work than it is the ubiquitous experience of clocking in and trying to make the most of something dreadfully boring with a group of people you probably otherwise wouldn’t hang out with. </span><i><span>The Paper</span></i><span>, meanwhile, is so specific and real, I feel like it might double as a surprisingly educational tool for a general audience about the state of journalism right now, who come in with preconceived notions of how it all works.</span></p> <p><span>For example, there’s an episode in which Esmeralda, the previous interim EIC of the paper, tries to get the team to go down the road of doing advertorials to cover some lifestyle products she wants, and Ned intervenes and says the team will review these items instead of uncritically promoting them for the paper. Eventually, it becomes clear that these products all have some serious adverse effects, leading to the staff getting sick or injured, and Ned, in a head-on collision of journalistic principles and the fear of incoming deadlines, tries to test all of them himself at once, and that goes about as well as you’d expect. Rather than trying to completely recapture </span><i><span>The Office</span></i><span>’s magic by making Ned a carbon copy of Steve Carell’s Michael Scott, </span><i><span>The Paper </span></i><span>finds its own way to the same hysterical conclusions, all in a way that feels very specific to the workplace it follows. </span><i><span>The Paper </span></i><span>is actually pretty restrained in its ties to its predecessor when it could have cynically leaned into that connection in order to bait the college kids who marathon the older series between classes into watching it.</span></p>

 <figure id="attachment_2000625763" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000625763"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000625763">© Peacock</figcaption></figure> <p><span>The strongest tie </span><i><span>The Paper </span></i><span>has to </span><i><span>The Office </span></i><span>is in Oscar (Oscar Nunez), the sole returning character in the main cast, who certainly has his own stuff going on, but also sometimes just feels like he’s there to bring attention to the fact that this show is a spin-off of something else. Nunez has several scenes that feel tailor-made to remind people that Michael Scott is somewhere out there off-screen. Some of the callbacks are good, like the metanarrative of him not wanting to be filmed by the documentary crew following him around again, but then he directly quotes bits from </span><i><span>Office </span></i><span>episodes, and it loses me. We are all the products of the jobs and coworkers we once had, but I had multiple instances of being like, “Oh, right, this show might one day be some kind of bid for a shared universe of mockumentaries for Peacock to churn out, not unlike the gross churnalism Ned and his team try to avoid.” Perhaps I’m being cynical, but </span><i><span>The Paper </span></i><span>stands so well on its own that I don’t feel like it needed the</span><i><span> Office</span></i><span> tie-in to prop it up.</span></p> <p><span>All that being said, I get why Peacock would want to go back to </span><i><span>The Office</span></i><span>.</span> <span>Its workplace documentary format is still really clever, and when I watched the original show back in the day, I was always fascinated by how it would present scenes that, as far as the characters involved were concerned, were clearly not supposed to be on camera. Some of the </span><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N56tjXt6JoY&amp;pp=ygUTamltIHByb3Bvc2VzIHRvIHBhbQ%3D%3D"><span>most iconic scenes from the original series</span></a><span> were shot at a distance, with un-mic’d actors pantomiming a scene the viewer ostensibly wasn’t supposed to see, or they’re shot through the crack of a barely opened door like the crew is being nosey as shit for the plot. When </span><i><span>The Office </span></i><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-GY-dj-YSPs"><span>blew the lid off this</span></a><span> and had a member of the documentary crew interfere with the action onscreen nine seasons in, it was met with a lot of blowback from longtime fans. </span><i><span>The Paper </span></i><span>is already more overtly playing with the fourth wall, so maybe that will set viewer expectations appropriately, but even after 12 years, the format still works, and </span><i><span>The Paper </span></i><span>is using it well without resorting to the same playbook.</span></p> <p><span>I’m glad I gave </span><i><span>The Paper </span></i><span>a chance after my first impression of it left me cold. A workplace comedy about a fumbling newspaper could have made a lot of uninformed or irresponsible jokes about a profession that is historically misunderstood, both willfully and because misinformation spreads on the internet like wildfire. Instead, it has a surprising level of empathy for the plight of the modern reporter. You have corporate owners who know nothing about the job meddling in your affairs, commenters nipping at your heels, and you’re more often than not barely compensated or rewarded for your efforts. I haven’t set foot in a local paper’s newsroom in six years, but I still marveled at how clearly </span><i><span>The Paper</span></i><span> sees that a lot of corporate media’s biggest obstacles are the same ones small-town reporters are fighting against in towns you’ve never heard of but that are full of people who still read the print version of their local news. All of its raunchy humor, clever cinematography, and painstakingly awkward comedic set pieces of the kind you know and love from its predecessor funnel into a mockumentary that, at the end of the day, humanizes the people behind the bylines, and knows they’re at their best when they’re free to do the work they came here to do, without constant interference from the powers that be.&nbsp;</span></p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/tony-hawk-thug-underground-intro-remake-remaster-ps2-activision-2000625750</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/tony-hawk-recreated-thug%E2%80%99s-classic-intro-and-got-fans-more-excited-for-a-remake.1298517/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>It was just earlier this year that Activision published<em> <a href="https://kotaku.com/thps-3-4-tony-hawk-pro-skater-review-is-it-good-levels-1851786124">Tony Hawk’s Pro Skater 3+4</a></em>, a remastered collection of two of the best games in the skateboarding series. But now, after a fun video from Hawk himself, fans are once again begging for a <em>Tony Hawk’s Underground</em> remake to join the series’ slate of recent re-releases.</p> <p>Over the weekend, <a href="https://www.instagram.com/reel/DOg329HAQcP/e">Tony Hawk posted a short video on his personal Instagram page</a>. In it, the skateboarding legend re-created the intro cutscene found in the original PS2-era <em>Tony Hawk’s Underground.</em> Here’s the short video:</p> <blockquote data-instgrm-captioned="" data-instgrm-permalink="https://www.instagram.com/reel/DOg329HAQcP/?utm_source=ig_embed&amp;utm_campaign=loading" data-instgrm-version="14">  </blockquote>  <p>In the video, Hawk can be seen taking on the role of the player-created character, even wearing a similar outfit to the one sported by the default character. Using some nice editing, Hawk interacts with the game’s popular villain, <a href="https://kotaku.com/eric-sparrow-thps-3-4-thug-underground-remake-cameo-ps5-1851784341">Eric Sparrow</a>, even calling him a bully at one point. At the very end, Hawk leaves and jokes, “Whoa! I can get off my board?!”, a reference to the fact that in <em>THUG</em> players could, for the first time in franchise history, hop off their skateboards and walk around levels.</p>

 <p>But before you get too excited and assume Tony Hawk is teasing some future <em>Underground</em> remake ala <a href="https://kotaku.com/thps-3-4-remake-peeing-guy-canada-level-removed-censor-1851786232"><em>THPS 3+4,</em></a> calm down. The video is marked as “Not a <em>THUG</em> promo.” Hawk also claims that the reason he created this short bit of nostalgia bait is to have some fun and celebrate Video Games Day.</p> <p>“In hopes of bringing some joy to your timeline: Happy Video Games Day from E.S. and me,” posted Hawk on Instagram.</p> <p>And like, yeah, I get that he’s trying to make it clear this isn’t a teaser, but of course, the internet is going to internet. Many are already assuming or hoping that this Instagram post is actually the first bit of marketing for a full-on <em>Tony Hawk’s Underground</em> remake. And while I do think a <em>Tony Hawk’s Underground</em> remake is coming one day, I do believe Hawk here, and this is just him having fun with fans. <a href="https://kotaku.com/tony-hawk-underground-thug-remake-remaster-activision-1851780287">The famous skater has said in the past that he would love a <em>THUG</em> remake</a>, but made it clear that he doesn’t get to make that call. It’s all up to Activision, and considering the five-year gap between <em>THPS 1+2</em> and<em> THPS 3+4</em>, I’d suggest fans go play <a href="https://kotaku.com/games/thug-pro"><em>THUGPro</em></a> or something else while they wait for a <em>THUG</em> remake, because it’s likely many years away.</p>

              <p>We’re all familiar with the trolley problem. We’re all so familiar with it that we’re also familiar with all the spoofs of the trolley problem that have sprung up in recent years. But I’m pleased to say I’ve found a fresh take on the entire scenario: even sillier (if smarter) spoofs of the trolley problem. <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3219410/The_Trolley_Solution/"><em>The Trolley Solution</em></a> brings the classic black-and-white sketches to life in a series of video game vignettes, beginning with the classic question, but quickly descending into fantastically funny nonsense, including some completely splendid mini-games, one of which is a visual novel love story.</p> <p>You know how the trolley problem goes:</p> <blockquote><p>“A trolley is rapidly approaching five people tied to the tracks.</p> <p>You have the option to divert the trolley onto a different track.</p> <p>This action would save the five people, but it would kill someone else.</p> <p>What would you do?”</p></blockquote> <p>But in&nbsp;<em>The Trolley Solution</em>, the classic philosophical dilemma and many absurd riffs on it are brought to life in 3D, bringing a whole new level of reality to the hypothetical problem when the crudely animated people splatter into little blobs. What if, for instance, rerouting the trolley would knock a dog’s bone away? Can you really make the choice if it means watching the little doggy look into his empty bowl, his tail down, his head despondently hung? Other new variants it introduces on the classic dilemma are more elaborate and wonderfully original, unlike anything I’ve seen in those overly long Reddit threads where people with undue confidence misattribute philosophical doctrine. For instance,</p> <blockquote><p>“A trolley is quickly approaching your girlfriend, who is tied to the tracks.</p> <p>You have the option to divert the trolley to a different track, but on that track is your best friend, also tied up.</p> <p>However, you discover that your girlfriend has been cheating on you with your best friend.</p> <p>But your best friend didn’t know she was your girlfriend.</p> <p>To complicate things, your best friend is terminally ill and will die of cancer in a month.</p> <p>What will you do?”</p></blockquote>  <p>Honestly, I’m simple enough that I’d have been charmed just by a series of increasingly daft scenarios like these, especially since you get to see each play out, choosing whether to pull the lever or not. But&nbsp;<em>The Trolley Solution</em> is much more ambitious in its daftness. Levels constantly introduce one-off mechanics, at one point seeing the game turn into a perfect spoof of the billions of monochrome “hidden object” games that appeared in the wake of the fantastic&nbsp;<a href="https://kotaku.com/hidden-object-puzzle-game-hidden-folks-is-getting-free-1843541062"><em>Hidden Folks</em></a>, here with an entire trolley “hiding” in enormous, screens-wide illustrations packed with visual gags. I scarequote “hiding” given it’s a trolley, and even glasses and a <em>Where’s Waldo</em> hat can’t quite do it. Bless it, it’s trying. (The <em>Where’s Trolley</em> joke works much better in the UK where the books are called <em>Where’s Wally?</em>)</p>

 <p>At another point it becomes a third-person racing game, as you jump between tracks to gather coins and avoid oncoming trolleys. And yes, in one extended and completely brilliant sequence, the game becomes a lampooning visual novel, in which you play a young Japanese girl who, on her way to school, falls in love with a trolley. It has many different endings, one of which describes the situation where the girl and the trolley rush too quickly into an overly committed romance, later realizing the foundations for a lasting relationship had never been established, the two growing to loathe one another, before finally, acrimoniously, breaking up. Another, naturally, results in people getting run over by a trolley. It’s all very romantic. It contains dialogue like,</p> <blockquote><p>“Tameko tells Tomodachi all about her dream. As she talks a weird gut feeling makes her uneasy. She explains the nuances of picking between Deontology and Utilitarianism. It feels like there is something more to it, like a prophecy in the making…”</p></blockquote> <p>As much as I want to blurt out every single surprise game mode that appears, l obviously won’t, but I do have to share one more: There’s an entire Tamagotchi sim in there, in which—yes of course—you must feed, clean, and play with a young trolley until it grows into a happy and profitable adult. “Can you take care of it until it gains monetary and moral stability?” asks the game.</p>

Because the game’s black and white, and because the human characters are like even simpler <em>Human Fall Flat</em> figures, obviously it’s nothing outlandish, but people sure do go splat when they’re run over. And you will want to note that it does include a moment with someone jumping in front of a trolley. When that happened I shouted, “GOD DAMN IT!” and laughed very hard, because it really wasn’t OK in the best way.</p> <p>I swear, for all the stuff I’ve mentioned, there are so many more surprises in here. There are whole other short games, spoofs of well-known genres I’m dying to tell you about, and while a few of these are perhaps a little over-long (something done five times can be a lot more fun than something done ten times), they’re all so well-realized and funny. There’s a total of 40 levels, each containing its own unique trolley problem situation, and precisely none of them take the conceit seriously. Thank goodness.</p>

I installed it simply because I liked the cartoon art, having no idea where it was heading. It turns out it was heading all over the place, with a wicked sense of humor, and the chops to pull off half a dozen genre spoofs along the way. (And don’t worry if you see the DLC on the Steam store—as much as you can absolutely buy it (and the developer deserves it!), it’s part of a gag.)</p> <p>What a joyfully silly thing to exist. <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3219410/The_Trolley_Solution/">You should go buy it right now, it’s only $6.50</a>.</p>
