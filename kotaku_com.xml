              <p>Winter storms, ice buildup and grid overload during cold snaps can knock out power for hours or even days and leave you scrambling for ways to keep essential devices running. The <strong>Anker Solix C1000</strong> portable power station bundled with a 200W solar panel tackles this exact problem and <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4924/">Amazon just slashed it to an all-time low of $671, down from $1,299)</a>. This combo gives you 1,056 watt-hours of backup capacity with the <strong>ability to recharge from the sun</strong>, which means you can keep your furnace controls, internet router, medical devices or space heaters running during an outage.</p>

<h2>Perfect Solution During Wintertime Disasters</h2>
<p>The <strong>1,800-watt continuous power through SurgePad technology</strong> (which peaks to 2,400 watts) covers almost all appliances you would have to power through the duration of a blackout. That surge ability accommodates power startup demands of refrigerators or battery-powered heaters which frequently have 2-3 times their operating wattage for 1-2 seconds the moment they are switched on.</p>
<p>The 1,056 watt-hour LiFePO4 battery has a rating of well over 3,000 charge cycles before the battery falls to 80% capacity. In practical terms, if you discharge and charge this station once each week, you’ll have spirited performance well into the 10-year term. LiFePO4 chemistry has far better stability than typical lithium-ion, owing to increased cold-temperature handling and far lower propensity toward thermal runaway.</p>



<p>UltraFast mode charges the station to 80% capacity in 43 minutes and <strong>full power in 58 minutes</strong> on the connection of AC power and by the activation of the Anker app. That gives you the ability to recharge fast whenever there are fleeting interludes of power availability and the next blackout approaches. Normal power stations take 6-8 hours to be fully charged, and this does not help much where the grid power remains unstable.</p>
<p>This <strong>200W solar panel included makes this truly an off-grid solution</strong>: Monocrystalline cells of 23% efficiency draw significantly more power from ambient sun than older polycrystalline panels, which rarely achieve higher than 15-17% efficiency. You have four adjustable pitch angles of 30, 40, 50, and 80 degrees, allowing you to dial in the best position relative to the sun’s arc throughout the day and throughout the seasons.</p>



<p><strong>IP67 weatherproof grading</strong> of the panel means it won’t fail because of snow, rain, or dust. You’ll be able to leave it outdoors even for charging periods should the weather shift, but you’ll still have to cover the power station unit itself, which lacks a rating for direct exposure.</p>
<p>With <strong>11 total ports including six AC outlets</strong>, you can run multiple devices simultaneously without needing power strips or prioritizing what stays on. During a winter outage, this means keeping your router and modem online for communication, charging phones and laptops, running a CPAP machine overnight and powering a small space heater in one room, all from the same unit. The variety of ports <strong>(AC, USB-A, USB-C, car outlet)</strong> accommodates everything from full-size appliances down to small electronics without adapters.</p>
<p>At $671 for both the power station and solar panel, you’re looking at less than half the original $1,299 price. Comparable systems with similar capacity and solar charging capability typically run $900-1,200 even on sale.</p>

              <p>Amazon is making it a great time to expand your Lego Harry Potter collection, or even start one. We’ve been spotting several Wizarding World sets going for less recently. One of our favorite deals? <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4920/">The Lego Hogwarts Castle Owlery set, which is now priced at $36 on Amazon, after a 20% off from its regular price.</a></p>
<p>You’re saving a nice $9 while bringing one of the most iconic locations from the Harry Potter movies straight to your home. It’s going to look great on its own, but we’d suggest pairing it with one of the castle sets for a fuller Hogwarts setup. Just note that discounts on Lego sets aren’t common, and the ones that do pop up don’t usually stick around for long. If you have been wanting to relive your favorite memories from the movies you grew up watching, now is the time to act.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4920/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Makes for a Fun Weekend Project</h2>
<p>This set is designed for ages 8 and up, and gets you a total of 364 pieces. For a bit of a memory refresh, this tower is where Harry broke a lot of hearts back in the day by inviting Cho Chang to the Yule Ball (guilty), and also where the Hogwarts owls reside. You will find three Lego minifigures inside the box, including Harry Potter, Cho Chang, and Argus Filch, plus five adorable owl figures, including Pigwidgeon. There are window ledges for the owls to perch, and even some accessories to care for the smart messengers.</p>



<p>Each set also includes one of 14 collectible Hogwarts portraits. And if you plan on building a larger Lego Hogwarts setup, this one is part of a series of modular sets (each sold separately) that connect to form the most complete Hogwarts display to date. As we mentioned earlier, most other sets are discounted too, meaning you can grab a few for your setup without paying the full price right now!</p>
<p>The set comes with an instruction book that walks you through each step, one at a time. Compared with other similar builds, this one’s fairly simple to put together. But, if you prefer more detailed guidance, we recommend using the Lego Builder app for 3D instructions. It also lets you track your progress as you go.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4920/">It’s a limited-time discount, which is why we recommend acting fast to grab your set. Maybe you can treat yourself to it, or gift it to a Harry Potter fan in your life.</a></p>

              <p><em>Luigi’s Mansion</em>, the original game in the glorious ghost-hunting series, was a launch title released for the GameCube in 2001. However, beyond a remake on the much underloved 3DS in 2018, the 24-year-old classic has long been tough to play without using emulation. And it’s worth playing, because it’s completely brilliant! So it’s tremendous news that on October 30, the game is being added to the GameCube collection on what’s now called Nintendo Classics, available to anyone with a Switch 2 and the expanded subscription.</p> <p>OK, admittedly I’m struggling with the fact that I remember playing this game on release like it was a decade ago, not two and a half of them, but my own battle with linear time aside, this is all good news. It’s wild to me that <em>Luigi’s Mansion</em> hasn’t been ported to every Nintendo console since, given just what a stone-cold classic the third-person ghost-vacuuming game truly is.</p>

 <p>Poor Luigi, ever trembling in the shadow of his brave brother, is notified that luck is finally going his way, and he’s won a mansion! Except, he never entered the contest, and it turns out the place is a haunted wreck. Thankfully, Professor Elvin Gadd has made a base in the place (presumably squatting?), although he explains the building only popped into existence a few days earlier. Oh, and Mario’s trapped inside. So Luigi, using E. Gadd’s Poltergust 3000 vacuum cleaner, sets about clearing the mansion of its ghostly inhabitants.</p>

  <p>The game received a fairly frosty reception from some on its release in 2001 (<em>GameSpot</em> called it the most disappointing game of the year!), partly based on its relatively short length (it comes in under 10 hours), and partly because it wasn’t a&nbsp;<em>Mario</em> game. Much like the Switch 2 launching with a <em>Donkey Kong</em> title and not the expected new&nbsp;<em>Super Mario</em> extravaganza, the GameCube similarly confused the masses with a Luigi-led project that was an entirely new type of game from Nintendo. It wouldn’t be until almost a year later that <em>Super Mario Sunshine</em> came out to fill that gap, and <em>GameSpot</em> called that the most disappointing game of the year, too!</p>

 <p>Anyway, all those moaners were wrong, and judged not as a substitute for a <em>Super Mario</em> game but as something very different in its own right, <em>Luigi’s Mansion</em> shines. It’s quite easy (apart from the stupidly hard final boss), it’s relatively short, and it’s very, very funny, and that’s what it was setting out to be.</p>

 <p>It is, however, worth noting that this addition is the original game, and not the much prettier 2018 3DS remake, which itself now wallows in the sad misery of abandonware.</p> <p>If you have the Nintendo Switch Online + Expansion Pack subscription (oh <em>please</em> can Nintendo give that a new name too?), you’ll find that <em>Luigi’s Mansion</em> will appear in the GameCube section of Nintendo Classics this October 30, just in time for spooky season.</p>

              <p>Gaming at high frame rates with maxed-out settings doesn’t have to drain your bank account anymore. Asus just dropped a deal on two of its latest powerhouses: the TUF Gaming GeForce <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4923/">RTX 5070 is now down to $584 on Amazon (from $739)</a>, and <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4922/">the RTX 5080 sits at $1,349 (originally $1,599)</a>.</p>

<h2>Why Should You Pay Attention to These Cards?</h2>
<p>The RTX 5070 comes equipped with 12GB of GDDR7 memory whih is the most recent generation of graphics memory technology. GDDR7 brings much higher data transfer rates than the older cards’ GDDR6, so textures load sooner, stuttering is reduced, and you enjoy smoother action in memory-hungry titles like Cyberpunk 2077 or Microsoft Flight Simulator. 12GB capacity means you’ll have no VRAM bottlenecks at 1440p or even 4K resolutions in most titles, and provides you with headroom through the next couple of years as titles increasingly require increasing amounts of resources.</p>
<p>The RTX 5070 uses a 3.125-slot design which means it’s slightly thicker than traditional two-slot cards but not quite as massive as some three-slot monsters. This extra space allows for a more robust cooling solution without turning your case into an oven. Asus equips it with axial-tech fans that spin in alternating directions to reduce turbulence and increase airflow efficiency.</p>



<p>Upgrading to the RTX 5080, you’ll be getting 16GB of GDDR7 memory and the more substantial 3.6-slot build. This card aims directly at gamers who won’t compromise, running 4K resolution with ray tracing and still demanding triple-digit frame rates. That extra 4GB of VRAM over the 5070 makes all the difference when you’re gaming at higher resolutions and ultra textures or you’re doing content creation like video editing or 3D rendering on the side. Vapor chamber cooling on the RTX 5080 is an evolution of the older heat pipe technology. Instead of using the latter’s hollow tubes to conduct the heat, the vapor chamber distributes the thermal energy on a wider surface area, keeping the hotspot under control and delivering steady results even through long gaming marathons.</p>



<p>Both boards are PCIe 5.0 capable, doubling the bandwidth of PCIe 4.0. Now, you won’t be seeing huge real-world improvements to gaming these days, but future software and applications are going to be increasingly making use of that extra bandwidth. DisplayPort 2.1 and HDMI connectivity adds future-proof readiness of the next generation of monitors, including those scaling well beyond 4K resolution and higher refresh rates. If you have come to consider one of those new 240Hz 4K monitors, these cards actually have the ability to properly feed themIt manufactures these TUF Gaming cards using military-grade components and provides protective PCB coating.</p>
<p>At $584, the RTX 5070 undercuts what many people paid for last generation’s mid-range cards while delivering current-gen performance and features. The RTX 5080 at $1,349 brings flagship-tier gaming within reach of enthusiasts who don’t want to take out a loan for their hobby. Given that both cards have strong review scores on Amazon (4.7 stars for the 5070 across over 2,000 reviews, and 4.6 stars for the 5080), stock my sell out quickly.</p>
