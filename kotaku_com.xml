              <p><span>Pearl Abyss has confirmed that its highly anticipated open-world single-player game </span><i><span>Crimson Desert</span></i><span> will “definitively” not feature any kind of microtransaction-laden cash shop or in-game storefront at launch. The MMO maker says the single-player game’s $70 price tag reflects the all inclusive “premium experience” players should expect.</span></p> <p><span>The promise comes from an interview with Pearl Abyss’ PR and Marketing Director Will Powers on the </span><a href="https://youtu.be/MR9QMXJuGx4?si=lGwFcuz26j_cWZIJ&amp;t=1468"><i><span>Dropped Frames</span></i></a><span> podcast. Powers was asked if the game would feature a similar monetization model to Pearl Abyss’ MMO </span><i><span>Black Desert Online</span></i><span>. “This is a premium game you buy one time,” replied Powers. “I don’t wanna say there’s zero MTX, because there are pre-order bonuses that we have, but anything that’s announced and that’s coming at launch is strictly cosmetic.”</span></p>

 <p><span>When asked if there was a chance that </span><i><span>Crimson Desert</span></i><span> might launch with any sort of “cash shop” feature, Powers doubled down. “No. I can say that definitively,” he continued. “There is not a cosmetic cash shop. This is made to be a premium experience that you buy, and you enjoy the world, and not something for microtransactions…This is a premium experience. That’s the transaction. Full stop.”</span></p> <p><span>The “transaction” Powers is referring to in this context is </span><i><span>Crimson Desert’s </span></i><span>$70 launch price, in contrast to </span><i><span>Black Desert Online’s </span></i><span>“buy-to-play” model, which consists of a one-off $10 purchase, which can be combined with separate cosmetic microtransactions and one-time DLC purchases that range from $30 to $50. It’s also become more common even for single-player RPGs like <em>Assassin’s Creed Shadows</em> and <em>Dragon’s Dogma 2</em> to include microtransaction shops full of content that can’t be earned just by playing the game.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><span>While the need to clarify this may come across as odd to some, it likely stemmed from the announcement of </span><i><span>Crimson Desert’s</span></i><span> $80 “Deluxe Edition” pre-order option, which features several cosmetic items, such as the Kairos armor set and the Exclaire horse armor. There’s also a $280 “Collectors Edition,” but I’d wager you’re probably not bothered about microtransactions if you’re shelling out for that anyway. </span></p>

 <p><span>Powers’ wording also doesn’t rule out the possibility of other, non-cosmetic forms of DLC in the future, which wouldn’t come as a surprise considering that, as of February 1st, more than two million people have already wishlisted </span><i><span>Crimson Desert</span></i><span>.</span></p>
