            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><span>One of the many consequences of modern fandom’s obsession with “canon” is that stories that have open-ended themes or choices are now held to a new standard of scrutiny. Swaths of the video games we play are about choice, whether that be in the weapons we wield or the sacrifices we make; however, because the internet has become fixated on listing events in bullet points on wikis, the act of making choices and watching the consequences unfold isn’t enough. Some players want to be “right,” and they want video games and their creators to tell them so. </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/clair-obscur-expedition-33-rpg-review-in-progress-1851777402?_gl=1*9icn1w*_ga*MTc0MjY2NTg1OS4xNzQwMzc1OTc4*_ga_V4QNJTT5L0*czE3NDcyMzIxNjAkbzU4JGcxJHQxNzQ3MjQ1MDg0JGo2MCRsMCRoMCRkTGhKQ1VESkJYd2lqTzFUMTlocEx1a0ptWERkbVBiM21jZw.."><i><span>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</span></i></a> <span>is not primarily a choice-based game, but it does offer one at the very end that changes the story entirely. Since the RPG launched back in April, fans have debated the merits of both outcomes, but because a sequel is coming and some people need validation, the developers at Sandfall Interactive have come out and said there is no “correct” ending.</span></p>  <p><i><span>Clair Obscur</span></i> <a href="https://kotaku.com/clair-obscur-expedition-33-ending-verso-maelle-choice-1851778284"><span>ends in one of two ways</span></a><span>, depending on whether or not the player chooses to play the final duel as either the paintress Maelle or Verso, the painted version of her deceased brother. In an interview with Lits Play, </span><i><span>Clair Obscur </span></i><span>lead writer Jennifer Svedberg-Yen spoke about how both endings of the game are valid and were made with purpose. Neither was meant to be the “other” or “wrong” choice.</span></p>

 <p><span>“I tell everyone there is no ‘correct’ ending, there is no ‘canon’ ending, there is no ‘official Sandfall’ ending,” Svedberg-Yen said. “Both endings are there for a reason; we put them both there for a reason; they were designed in a very particular way. Neither is perfect. Both are heartbreaking in their own ways. Both of them have parts that make you glad, parts that you feel like, ‘okay, I want a happy ending for these characters,’ but both of them also have their own cost. It’s a reflection of reality. You know, a lot of times, some people’s happiness does come with its costs. Things are very rarely perfect. And I think we were really trying to also show both sides of the story.”</span></p>

  <p><span>She’s right. Obviously, the debate over which is the morally correct answer is a whole different discussion. I personally chose the Maelle ending because it felt thematically appropriate, while also understanding that the Verso choice is probably the one that provides the most closure. Both have their merits and drawbacks, and one of the rewarding things about choice-based games is that we get to argue about those forever. However, this modern need to have these decisions declared “correct,” either by the text or by the developers, has added an often dismissive layer to those discussions.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><span>To some extent, this goes back to an attachment players have to their own “canon.” If a sequel like </span><i><span>Infamous Second Son </span></i><span>chooses one of its predecessor’s endings to build off of, it raises questions about the other choice. Why was it there if it was going to be cast aside? What does it say about players who chose the other option? Were they wrong? Was any debate about the morality or merits of that choice for nothing? This is a cloud that has been hanging over the next </span><i><span>Mass Effect </span></i><span>game for nearly a decade, as the remnants of BioWare have to figure out how they’re going to make a fifth game set in the Milky Way that either works for all of </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/mass-effect-3-ending-shepard-catalyst-crucible-choice-1851313435"><i><span>Mass Effect 3</span></i><span>’s galaxy-defining final choices</span></a><span>, or picks one and moves the timeline forward from there.</span></p>

 <p><span>BioWare is an interesting example to point to when it comes to this dilemma, because even though the </span><i><span>Mass Effect </span></i><span>and </span><i><span>Dragon Age </span></i><span>communities love to throw around terminology like “canon” to refer to specific choices that are chosen by default if players don’t import a world state or save from a previous game, the studio doesn’t view it that way at all. The team has even said it would </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/dragon-age-veilguard-canon-choice-bioware-mass-effect-5-1851646112"><span>rather not acknowledge a decision</span></a><span> in a sequel like </span><i><span>Dragon Age: The Veilguard </span></i><span>than contradict it. This allows players to feel like their world state is valid, even if they’re not staring the ramifications of it in the face every game.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><span>Maybe it’s because I </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/baldur-s-gate-3-cyberpunk-mass-effect-character-creator-1851422575"><span>grew up spending a lot of my early roleplaying days</span></a><span> working within the gaps that developers didn’t fill, but I’ve never looked for confirmation from games that I was “right” when I made a decision.&nbsp; The need for a game or developer to justify what you’ve done suggests that making choices in games is about aligning your actions with the “true vision” of the developers, rather than actually expressing your own agency within the story. I almost always treat roleplaying in games as an opportunity for self-reflection. It’s a big part of why I make myself in character creators. These are my stories, and I’ll write them how I want. I’d rather a developer not pat me on the head and tell me everything I did was “correct” or aligned with canon; that’s not what it’s about, and it shouldn’t be a factor in our decision-making process.</span></p> <p><span>Perhaps the uncertainty about “what really happened” is too much for some people. For me, that flexibility, the co-existence of multiple possibilities and my ability to shape which way things go, is the best part of when games give me that autonomy.&nbsp; But the best choice-based games are the ones we’re still debating years later, not the ones for which the developers have retroactively decided which was the “one true choice.” So shoutout to Sandfall Interactive and Svedberg-Yen for sticking beside the decision they handed players, rather than capitulating to some imagined idea of “canon.” I hope they stay true to that in </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/clair-obscur-expedition-33-sequel-sandfall-interactive-2000620688"><span>the inevitable sequel</span></a><span>.</span></p>

              <p>Building a gaming PC can be a rewarding experience. I can also be frustrating as all hell. Sometimes, it is better to just get something that’s already assembled. It saves time both on shopping side of things when you’re trying to source each part you need as well as after it arrives. No delicate assembly. No headache-inducing cable management in the case. No dropping screws off the table and having them roll under the couch. Just take it out of the box and and start downloading&nbsp;<em>Hades II</em>. Right now for Prime Big Deals Days, you can save quite a big on a pre-built gaming PC. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4653/">The Alienware Aurora gaming desktop has dropped by 17%. That’s doesn’t sound like a lot, but it’s taking the price down from $1,845 to just $1,535. You’ll save $310.</a> That extra cash can buy an Xbox Game Pass Ultimate subscription for… just shy of one year? Wow, Microsoft needs to get a grip.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4653/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Top-tier Gaming Versatility</h2>
<p>Let’s talk specs. This Alienware gaming PC tower is powered by an Intel Core Ultra 7F processor and is packing the NVIDIA GeForce RTX 5070 graphics card. You’ll be able to play any modern AAA game and even be able to push the settings quite a bit, maintaining a high and stutter-free framerate. It can even handle livestream your gaming to Twitch or YouTube.</p>
<p>You get a whopping 32GB of RAM plus a whole 1TB of storage. That’s a ton of space to get your started downloading all sorts of games off Steam, the Epic Games Store, or any of the other PC gaming storefronts. This build will also prove to perform reliably outside of gaming. Graphics and processor intensive workflows will be breezy on this machine. Touch up large files in Photoshop or edit together videos in 4K without a problem.</p>



<p>If you’re worried about overheating, this PC employs a 240mm heat exchanger which uses liquid cooling on the CPU to heighten thermal resistance. That should keep the temperatures relatively low during longer gaming sessions. It’s well ventilated allowing for efficient airflow, cooling and acoustics.</p>
<p>It wouldn’t be a capital G “Gaming” PC without some RGB lighting. You can create and edit the AlienFX lighting across the whole ecosystem using the free Alienware Command Center software.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4653/">During Prime Big Deals Days, this RTX 5070 gaming PC from Alienware has come down by a dramatic $310.</a> Get it for just $1,535 for a limited time before the Amazon sales event is over.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/blink-video-doorbell-is-almost-free-amazon-offloads-its-own-brand-at-a-loss-2000632081</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Amazon has made serious moves into home security with its <em>Ring</em> and <em>Blink</em> brands and gives homeowners accessible ways to monitor their properties without professional installation. If you want a doorbell camera that’s effective, affordable and lets you keep tabs on everything happening at your front door, <strong>Blink is the way to go</strong>. The<a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4647/"> newest model of the Blink video doorbell just hit a record low price of $34 (down from $69) for Prime Big Deal Day</a>, and this deal ends tonight. It’s <strong>exclusively available to Prime members</strong>.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4647/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Two Years’ Worth of Battery Life Redefines Everything</h2>
<p>The larger pain point with doorbell cameras is often the power issue: Hardwired versions demand electrical work that the average person would like to do without, and battery-powered versions require charging every few weeks. The <strong>Blink video doorbell eliminates this nuisance with a two-year battery life on two AA lithium batteries</strong>. Consider that: you install it once and don’t mess with it again until the year 2027. No climbing ladders to haul it down to charge, no panic should it die on vacation, no maintenance woes.</p>



<p>The camera provides a <strong>vertical field of view that captures people from head to toe</strong>&nbsp;which matters more than you might think. Standard doorbell cameras often cut off packages left on the ground or miss the tops of tall visitors’ heads. This full-body perspective means you see delivery drivers placing packages, kids trick-or-treating, or anyone approaching your door in complete context. The 1<strong>080p HD resolution delivers clear images</strong> during daylight, and infrared night vision switches on automatically after sunset to maintain visibility in complete darkness.</p>
<p>The integrated Sync Module Core (see picture above) is the control center and connects your doorbell to the home’s Wi-Fi network and facilitates all communication between the doorbell and the phone version of the Blink app. It is <strong>simple to plug the module into a standard outlet somewhere in your home</strong> and get the doorbell connected to the phone. Should the button be pressed or motion be detected, the event is captured by the module, then triggers an instant notification on the device.</p>



<p>Detection areas let you decide what areas will cause recording: If the doorbell is pointing at the busy street, then you can mask that section off so cars passing by don’t jam your phone with unimportant notifications. Focus the detection zone on your sidewalk and porch, then receive notifications for activity that is relevant. <strong>You can customize the sensitivity via the app</strong>&nbsp;which gives you the freedom to decide just how much movement will trigger a recording.</p>
<p>The doorbell is controllable via Alexa voice control and can be integrated with other compatible Alexa devices. Ask Alexa to display your front door and the feed is shown on Echo Show devices around your house.</p>
<p>At just $34, that is a 50% off deal and the lowest price on this model ever. Make sure you don’t miss it before it runs out of stock.</p>

              <p>We’re deep into Prime Big Deals Days now — Amazon’s two-day sales even where you can save a bunch of cash on products across every category. It’s a great time to pick up that espresso maker you’ve been eyeing or that bidet your brother have been trying to convince you to get for months. Something you might have been waiting on for a discount is one of those TV backlights. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4644/">Good news, the Govee Envisual TV LED Backlight T2 is one of the Prime Big Deals this week and you can save as much as 46%.</a></p>
<p>There are three different sizes to match however big your TV is. The 11.8-foot light strip is sized for TVs between 55 inches and 65 inches. The 16.4-foot light strip is made for TVs between 75 inches and 85 inches. Then the 21-foot light strip is for your mega mondo-sized TVs at 98 to 100 inches.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4644/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>
<p>For shorthand, we’ll call them small, medium, and large. The small set normally priced at $140 has come down to $75. The medium dropped from $170 to an even $100. And then the big boy large light strip is down from $220 to just $150.</p>

<h2>Synchronize Color</h2>
<p>The way the Govee light strips work is a camera sensor is placed on the top of your TV. This model actually has a dual-camera sensor to more accurately capture the color on screen. It then takes that color and assigns them around the light strip which you’ve installed behind your TV around the edge. Each light strip has 60 LEDs per meter and they glow matching the color on screen as if to extend your viewing across the wall and room.</p>



<p>You can customize how your Govee Envisual TV LED Backlight T2 looks. Using the app, manually adjust the saturation of the lighting effects to either be super vibrant or more subtle. Go with whichever fits the vibe of what you’re watching. It works well with movies, shows, or even video games. Casting the vibrant colors of each new zone you come across in <em>Hollow Knight</em>: Silksong can dramatically enhance your experience.</p>
<p>Combine the backlight LED with other Govee products such as wall or corner lamps. Have all the lights in your home synchronize to what’s on screen, bathing you and your living room in colorful light.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4644/">Get your set of the Govee Envisual TV LED Backlight T2 on sale today for as low as just $75.</a> Discount will be for as much as 46% at least through Prime Big Deals Day.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/game-pass-october-2025-ninja-gaiden-grinch-price-2000633269</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/game-pass-adds-the-grinch-christmas-adventures-after-big-price-hike.1319911/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Microsoft has announced the the first list of games being added to Xbox Game Pass <a href="https://kotaku.com/game-pass-price-subscription-renewal-delay-xbox-2000632625">since the service’s unpopular price hike news rolled out last week</a>. It includes <em>The Grinch: Christmas Adventures – Merry &amp; Mischievous Edition</em>, the update to a 2023 co-op holiday adventure that I’m sure fans have been waiting for.</p> <p>The “festive platformer” has you searching for collectibles, snowboarding down Mount Crumpit, and even parachuting through Whoville. Apparently that was not enough to impress many of the only 27 people who reviewed the $40 Steam version. “This game is BAD!” wrote one. “Quite terrible all things considered,” wrote another. “The original game from the 90’s was a world play style game with objectives and missions…this is a game for a 5 year old.”</p>

 <p>Don’t let that completely dissuade you from checking it out though! Here’s everything coming to the various, newly priced tiers of Game Pass in October 2025:</p> <blockquote> <ul> <li><strong><em>Supermarket Simulator&nbsp;</em></strong><strong>(Cloud, Console, and PC) – October 8</strong><br> Game Pass Ultimate, Game Pass Premium, PC Game Pass</li> <li><strong><em>Baldur’s Gate and Baldur’s Gate II: Enhanced Editions</em></strong><strong>&nbsp;(PC) – October 9</strong><br> Game Pass Ultimate, Game Pass Premium, PC Game Pass</li> <li><strong><em>The Casting of Frank Stone </em></strong><strong>(Cloud, PC, and Xbox Series X|S) – October 14</strong><br> Game Pass Ultimate, Game Pass Premium, PC Game Pass</li> <li><strong><em>Ball x Pit </em></strong><strong>(Cloud, Console, and PC) – October 15</strong><br> Game Pass Ultimate, PC Game Pass</li> <li><strong><em>The Grinch: Christmas Adventures </em></strong><strong>(Cloud, Console, and PC) – October 15</strong><br> Game Pass Ultimate, Game Pass Premium, PC Game Pass</li> <li><strong><em>Eternal Strands </em></strong><strong>(Cloud, PC, and Xbox Series X|S) – October 15</strong><br> Now with Game Pass Premium</li> <li><strong><em>He Is Coming&nbsp;</em></strong><strong>(Game Preview)</strong><strong>&nbsp;(PC) – October 15</strong><br> Now with Game Pass Premium</li> <li><strong><em>Ninja Gaiden 2 Black </em></strong><strong>(Cloud, PC, and Xbox Series X|S) – October 15</strong><br> Now with Game Pass Premium</li> <li><strong><em>Pax Dei&nbsp;</em></strong><strong>(PC) – October 16</strong><br> Game Pass Ultimate, Game Pass Premium, PC Game Pass</li> <li><strong><em>Keeper </em></strong><strong>(Cloud, PC, and Xbox Series X|S) – October 17</strong><br> Game Pass Ultimate, PC Game Pass</li> <li><strong><em>Evil West </em></strong><strong>(Cloud, Console, and PC) – October 21</strong><br> Game Pass Ultimate, Game Pass Premium, PC Game Pass</li> <li><strong><em>Ninja Gaiden 4 </em></strong><strong>(Cloud, PC, and Xbox Series X|S) – October 21</strong><br> Game Pass Ultimate, PC Game Pass</li> </ul> </blockquote> <p>That is 12 games in total, and some of them are shaping up to be quite good, especially <em>Ninja Gaiden 4</em>. But it’s also worth noting that only three of these games require Game Pass Ultimate. The rest are all available with Game Pass Premium or Game Pass PC. This is the last batch hitting before the new $30-a-month price hits most Ultimate subscribers on November 4, so while Microsoft might be trying to win players over with a few surprises in November, this month is mostly what we expected it to be.</p> <p>The three games leaving Game Pass on October 15 are <em>Cocoon</em>, <em>Core Keeper</em>, and <em>Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutants Unleashed.</em> <em>Cocoon</em> in particular is an outstanding puzzle adventure you can finish in just a couple of sittings. If you haven’t given it a try or already beaten it, I highly recommend checking it out in the next week before it’s gone.</p>

              <p>Prime Day deals are going in full swing, making it a great time to invest in a gaming monitor. If you’ve been looking for something feature-packed at a more approachable price, <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4641/">we’ve just spotted the 27-inch LG UltraGear QHD gaming monitor going for $297 on Amazon, which is a 41% discount off its regular price.</a></p>
<p>This is a significant drop, but it’s only limited to Prime users at the moment. Non-Prime users can snag it up for $349, which is also a nice $151 off. Prime members also enjoy free delivery, but just be sure to get your orders in soon. The retailer has marked it as a limited-time deal, and we won’t be surprised if it expires soon.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4641/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Better Color Accuracy on a Massive Screen</h2>
<p>The 27-inch screen size is quite spacious, offering a decent 2560×1440 QHD resolution. The IPS panel offers vibrant colors, exceptional contrast, and impressive detail – all of which come together to create an immersive gaming or streaming experience. It also supports VESA DisplayHDR 400 and covers up to 95% of the DCI-P3 color gamut, so you can expect deeper blacks and more visual accuracy. There’s an ultra-fast 1ms (GtG) response time, paired with a 240Hz refresh rate to keep slowdowns and lags at bay. Racing past opponents or engaging in competitive matches where every second counts; this monitor won’t disappoint.</p>



<p>It’s officially G-SYNC Compatible and also supports AMD FreeSync Premium. You can choose a GPU without worrying about screen tearing or stutter. Connectivity options are plenty – HDMI 2.1, DisplayPort 1.4, and a 4-pole headphone out that supports DTS Headphone:X. The stand is also adjustable, so you can play around with tilt and height to get the right viewing angle for yourself. This is also great for setups that multiple people use. You don’t really have to settle for an awkward angle while trying to make it work for you.</p>
<p>LG also includes an Enhanced Gaming GUI that lets you choose between display presets like Gamer, FPS, or RTS modes for an even better view.</p>
<p>All in all, this deal gets you an impressive, high-resolution gaming monitor for less. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4641/">If you’re a Prime member, you can get it for under $300. Non-prime members are in luck, too, since they can grab one for $349, which is still a good discount on a model this packed.</a> It’s a limited-time discount, so if you’ve been thinking of making the upgrade, we recommend grabbing it as soon as you can.</p>

              <p>Smartphone upgrades are usually expensive, especially if you’re looking to grab the latest model from top brands like Apple, Samsung, Google Pixel, etc. But that’s not the case today.</p>
<p>Now is a great time to pick a new smartphone for yourself or gift it to a loved one, thanks to Amazon’s Prime Big Deals Days.<a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4640/"> The retailer has slashed the price of the Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra (256GB) down to $935 for Prime members and $950 for non-members.</a> That’s up to a massive 28% off. This model comes unlocked and even includes a 1-year U.S. warranty for peace of mind.</p>

The main 200MP wide-angle lens offers incredible clarity, with 2x optical quality zoom. Then there’s a 50MP ultra-wide lens, a 50MP telephoto lens with 5x and 10x optical zoom, and a 10MP telephoto with 3x optical zoom. The 12MP front camera keeps your selfies detailed and gram-worthy. Galaxy AI takes your photos and videos to the next level by letting you make quick edits and even clean up background noise for better clips.</p>



<p>The powerful 5,000mAh battery is designed to last an entire day of use, so you won’t have to worry about juicing it up mid-day. Those using a Galaxy smartwatch can enjoy some helpful health and fitness features with the two devices are paired together. And since it’s an unlocked model, you can use it with any carrier of your choice, from T-Mobile to Verizon, Xfinity, and others.</p>

              <p>Was Netflix’s<em> The Witcher</em> trying to give Cavill the boot as early as season 2? Did <em>Borderlands 4</em> cut one of the previous game’s most unpopular characters during development? And why is Atari making it harder to play an all-time classic on PC? It’s another edition of Morning Checkpoint, <em>Kotaku</em>‘s daily roundup of gaming news and culture. Craft breweries <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/05/business/craft-breweries-close-sales-decline.html">are apparently on the decline</a>, the surest sign yet that the millennial zeitgeist is dying. This is <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/05/business/craft-breweries-close-sales-decline.html">not a good thing</a>. I am also part of the problem, having traded my beloved Hazy IPAs at the <em>local</em> bar for cheap pounders from the grocery store.</p> <h2>The original <em>System Shock 2</em> is disappearing from stores thanks to the remaster</h2> <p>As spotted <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-original-system-shock-2-will-be-delisted-from-steam-soon-then-lumped-in-with-the-more-expensive-remaster">by<em> Rock, Paper, Shotgun</em></a>, the 1999 sci-fi immersive sim classic will be delisted from PC storefronts on October 10. From that point forward, the only way to access it will be as part of the 25th anniversary remaster. The original game was just $10 to buy individually, but will cost $30 to access as part of the remaster. “Existing owners of <em>System Shock 2</em> (1999) will still be able to re-download and play it from their library, but new users will no longer be able to purchase <em>System Shock 2</em> (1999) as a standalone product,” <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/866570/view/542243728060844444?l=english">reads a notice</a> from publisher Atari.</p>

 <h2>Netflix deletes an important date in its report about Liam Hemsworth taking over for Henry Cavill in <em>The Witcher</em></h2> <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">Either that's typo or that Henry Cavill shit was even messier than we think, because season 2 premiered in 2021 and Cavill didn't even announce he was leaving until the end of 2022 <a href="https://t.co/v2pHao4f5k">https://t.co/v2pHao4f5k</a></p> <p>— Paul Tassi (@PaulTassi) <a href="https://twitter.com/PaulTassi/status/1975657153420742935?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 7, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <p>The streaming company <a href="https://www.netflix.com/tudum/features/liam-hemsworth-the-witcher-geralt-transformation">published its own profile</a> of Hemsworth alongside a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HK9dU6JIroU"><em>Witcher</em> season 4 trailer</a>, but it included a very curious detail. According to the original version of the article, Hemsworth was first contacted about taking over the role back in 2020. That was between when season 1 and 2 aired, and two years before Cavill was officially replaced. This data point might add more fuel to the intrigue surrounding <a href="https://kotaku.com/witcher-netflix-henry-cavill-season-4-superman-why-1849723343">his messy departure</a>, but Netflix has now gone back and <a href="https://www.netflix.com/tudum/features/liam-hemsworth-the-witcher-geralt-transformation">deleted the date</a> from the profile altogether without any explanation. So now it’s&nbsp;<em>definitely</em> fueling more intrigue.</p>

 <h2>A controversial <em>Borderlands 3</em> character was seemingly cut from the sequel</h2> <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">Alright I guess we're gonna talk about it:</p> <p>AVA WAS CUT FROM BORDERLANDS 4</p> <p>There are numerous files related to her in the game, more specifically outlining that she was completely replaced by Amara late in development. This means yes, she was originally going to team up with… <a href="https://t.co/QF8ESnQp0p">https://t.co/QF8ESnQp0p</a> <a href="https://t.co/tBoVNJ8hpq">pic.twitter.com/tBoVNJ8hpq</a></p> <p>— EpicNNG (@EpicNNG) <a href="https://twitter.com/EpicNNG/status/1975222704094814674?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 6, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <p>Ava debuted in <em>Borderlands 3</em> as Vault Hunter Maya’s apprentice. Many players did not like her and were relieved she did not return in <em>Borderlands 4</em>. But <a href="https://x.com/EpicNNG/status/1975223565248299443">new datamining</a> of the files suggests that might have not always been the plan. File names suggest her role may have been replaced by the new Vault Hunter Amara, indicating Gearbox was paying very close attention to feedback from the last game when trying to nail the new one’s story, which it mostly does.</p>

 <h2>Sony is siding with <em>Battlefield 6</em> now that Microsoft owns<em> Call of Duty</em></h2> <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">Battlefield 6 Marketing With PlayStation Kicks Off:<a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/Battlefield6?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#Battlefield6</a> </p> <p>Hollywood, US: <a href="https://t.co/lssW3IpMp5">pic.twitter.com/lssW3IpMp5</a></p> <p>— @Zuby_Tech (@Zuby_Tech) <a href="https://twitter.com/Zuby_Tech/status/1975538723698926033?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 7, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <p><em>Battlefield 6</em> ads are out in full force this week and people have spotted many of them with promotions for PlayStation 5, <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/news/2025/10/now-xbox-owns-call-of-duty-sonys-investing-its-marketing-budget-into-battlefield-6-instead"><em>Push Square</em></a> reports. The irony is that Sony spent much of the PS4 console generation and this one paying Activision extra to promote its platform as the best place to play <em>Call of Duty</em>, complete with exclusive early access and other perks. Microsoft has promised versions of new entries in the series would have platform parity and Sony, understandably, now has little interest in helping to promote its rival’s biggest blockbuster.</p>

 <h2><em>Battlefield 6</em> appears to be always-online</h2> <p>That’s according <a href="https://www.doesitplay.org/game/Battlefield%206/ps5/Base%20PS5?region=PEGI&amp;version=Standard">to Does It Play</a>, which reports that the game needs an internet connection to work, even for the main campaign, even though <a href="https://kotaku.com/assassins-creed-mirage-dlc-jump-button-battlefield-6-disc-2000632532">the data appears to technically come the PS5 disc</a>.

Design director Matt Singh said players can mainline the sequel’s main story “fairly quickly” but that each biome will have plenty of side-content to offer fans who are interested in taking their time. The first, Paradise Island, will take over 12 hours to exhaust, with other biomes being “not much smaller.”</p> <h2>ICYMI:</h2> <ul> <li><a href="https://kotaku.com/robin-williams-zelda-ai-slop-human-centipede-sora-2000632483">Zelda Williams is fed up with people sending her AI slop of her dad</a></li> <li><a href="https://kotaku.com/tron-ares-reviews-rotten-tomatoes-jared-leto-fortnite-2000632606"><em>Tron: Ares</em> is another Disney cash-in devoid of humanity</a></li> <li><a href="https://kotaku.com/baldurs-gate-3-larian-studios-elon-musk-ai-xai-douse-2000632638">Baldur’s Gate 3’s head of publishing calls bullshit on Elon Musk’s AI game</a></li> </ul> <h2>Watch this:</h2>
