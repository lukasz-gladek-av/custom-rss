                  Experience spatial audio with head tracking and 24-hour battery life.

              <p>Premium noise-canceling headphones are a big investment, but they can turn your commutes, flights, and focus sessions into private audio bubbles anywhere. The <strong>Bose QuietComfort Ultra</strong> headphones in <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6405/">this limited edition Deep Plum color are on sale for $279 on Amazon, down from their list price of $429</a> and it is<strong> the lowest price ever</strong> which makes them almost half the price of Apple’s Airpods Max.</p>
<p>This “Ultra” version is Bose’s ultimate model and it is (way) better than the standard QuietComfort line and has many improvements that make it worthy of the “Ultra” name. The new features are <strong>spatial audio with head tracking</strong>, <strong>CustomTune technology</strong> that changes the sound to fit the shape of your ear and <strong>Immersion Mode</strong> which combines the best noise cancellation with three-dimensional audio.</p>

<h2>Head Tracking and Spatial Audio Make Personal Concert Halls</h2>
<p>The QuietComfort Ultra has Bose’s spatial audio technology which turns stereo tracks into<strong> immersive three-dimensional soundscapes</strong> where instruments are placed around your head in specific ways. This technology doesn’t just add fake reverb or widening effects but it actually moves audio elements around to make depth and separation that make music sound more real and interesting. Head tracking sensors know when you turn your head and change the soundstage so that vocals stay in front of you and instruments stay in their places which makes it feel like you’re in a room with speakers, where sound sources stay in one place instead of moving with your head like regular headphones.</p>



<p>CustomTune technology looks at the shape of your ears and how sound travels through your ear canals, and then it automatically changes the audio profile to make up for any differences in how sound travels through your ears. Because of the shape and size of your ears, they respond to different frequencies in different ways. This <strong>personalization makes sure you hear music the way the artist intended</strong>, not a generic tuning that works okay for everyone but not great for anyone. When you first put on the headphones, the calibration process only takes a few seconds and Tone sweeps are played through the drivers while microphones measure how your ears respond.</p>
<p>Immersion Mode uses Bose’s <strong>best noise cancellation and spatial audio processing to make it so that outside noise completely goes away</strong> and music surrounds you in three dimensions. This mode turns flights or commutes into private listening rooms where the sound of engines and people talking goes away completely and when you want to be alone but still want standard stereo imaging, Quiet Mode gives you traditional noise cancellation without spatial processing. Aware Mode sends outside sounds back through the headphones so you can hear announcements, traffic, or conversations without taking them off.</p>



<p>The microphone array uses beamforming technology to focus on your voice while filtering out background noise which means that calls sound clear even in busy streets or coffee shops. The call quality on older Bose models was okay, but <strong>the Ultra is much better because it has better signal processing</strong> that separates speech from background noise more effectively.</p>
<p>The<strong> battery lasts for 24 hours of regular audio playback</strong> and 18 hours of Immersion Mode, which is enough time for several international flights or a full work week without needing to be charged. The quick charge feature lets you listen for 2.5 hours after just 15 minutes of being plugged into USB-C which is great for when you forget to charge overnight and need to leave quickly.</p>
<p>Dropping from $429 to $279 makes the <strong>QuietComfort Ultra cheaper than the standard QuietComfort models</strong> typically sell for during sales which is a rare opportunity to get flagship features at mid-tier pricing. The combination of personalized tuning, immersive spatial processing and exceptional call quality delivers outstanding value at this discounted price point.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/sonos-era-100-bluetooth-and-wifi-speaker-drops-to-record-low-price-amazon-offloads-last-units-before-christmas-2000653537</link>

              <p>There are a lot of Bluetooth speakers to choose from, from cheap ones to expensive ones. But Sonos always comes out on top in the mid- to high-end range, where sound quality matters more than just getting loud. The<strong> Era 100 is Sonos’s small smart speaker</strong> for rooms where full-sized speakers are too big <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5807/">and it’s now $169 on Amazon, down from its original price of $199</a>. This is the lowest price ever just before Christmas which makes it a great gift for music lovers who value good sound quality over flashy features.</p>
<p>The Era 100 has <strong>WiFi streaming, Bluetooth connectivity, and Trueplay room correction</strong> all in one small package that can fit on a kitchen counter or nightstand. It also has stereo separation that most single-unit speakers can’t match which makes it the perfect way to get started with Sonos or a useful addition to an existing multi-room setup.</p>

<h2>Architecture with two tweeters</h2>
<p>Sonos designed the Era 100 with t<strong>wo tweeters that point outward to create real left and right channel separation in one box</strong> which makes music sound wider and more open than regular mono speakers. The two tweeters in this design let you hear instruments spread out across a soundstage instead of all coming from one point in space. The new Sonos speakers have a processor that is 47% faster than the old ones and lets them process audio more accurately, even at high volumes, so they don’t distort like other speakers do when they are pushed too hard. The<strong> midwoofer is 25% bigger and handles bass frequencies with authority</strong>, and gives you a low-end punch that you can feel in your chest without needing a separate subwoofer for most types of music.</p>



<p>Trueplay tuning technology turns the Era 100 from a good speaker into one that works best in your room by <strong>using your iPhone’s microphone to figure out how sound bounces off of walls, furniture, and other surfaces</strong>: You walk around the room waving your phone, which lets the speaker map the room’s acoustic features and change its output as needed. Trueplay makes sure that the sound quality is always the same, no matter where the speaker is. For example, a speaker in a corner sounds very different from one on a bookshelf or kitchen counter.</p>
<p>WiFi streaming is what makes the Era 100 connect: You can access music services like Spotify, Apple Music, Amazon Music, and many more directly through the Sonos app. This network-based method gives you better sound quality than Bluetooth compression and lets you play different content in each room or group speakers together. The speaker also works with AirPlay 2, which makes it easy to connect to Apple devices.</p>



<p>The <strong>small size is just under 7 inches tall and 5 inches wide</strong> and makes it easy to put almost anywhere without taking up too much space. The matte black or white finish on the Era 100 makes it look good on both modern minimalist shelves and traditional wood furniture. The top panel has touch controls for play, pause, volume, and skip, so you can interact with it even when your phone isn’t right there.</p>
<p>At this price, the Era 100 is now competitive with mid-range Bluetooth speakers that don’t have WiFi streaming, room correction, or multi-room capabilities.</p>
