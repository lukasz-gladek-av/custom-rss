              <p><em>Grand Theft Auto 5</em> is the second best-selling game of all time. Only <em>Minecraft</em> beats it. No other game even comes close. So it’s not surprising that after more than a decade, people expect big things from <em>Grand Theft Auto 6</em>. But the growing gravity well around the game’s impending release transcends fan hype and bullish proclamations from LinkedIn-pilled industry watchers. The vibes keep intensifying to the point of bordering on desperation. <em>GTA 6</em> will be huge. <em>GTA 6</em> <em>must</em> be huge.</p> <p>Out of this uniquely volatile cocktail comes statements like the following. “I mean, there are AAA games and then there’s AAAA games and I’d argue that<em> Grand Theft Auto</em> is potentially the AAAAA game, it’s just bigger than anything else both in the scope and scale of the game and the kind of cultural impact that it has and the attention it demands,” Devolver Digital co-founder Nigel Lowrie <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/why-hollow-knight-silksong-is-this-years-gta-6-and-whether-a-juggernaut-stomping-on-your-release-date-really-matters">told <em>IGN</em></a> this week.</p> <p>It was in the context of a conversation about how smaller companies navigate the minefield of modern release dates, where at any moment all of the oxygen could be sucked out of the room by bigger hits, suffocating a game’s chances of finding an audience before players even give it a try. Hardly anyone was staking out release dates for the fall until Rockstar announced that <em>GTA 6</em> had been delayed to May 2026. Even now, <em>Silksong</em>‘s surprise release date announcement just last month drove scores of other indie games <a href="https://kotaku.com/every-game-delayed-silksong-hollowknight-demonschool-baby-steps-cloverpit-2000620407">to get out of the way</a> of its September 4 launch.</p>

 <p>Lowrie suggested <em>GTA 6</em> has the power to “blot out the sun” when it comes to attention in the gaming world. “AAAAA” isn’t just a reflection of the long-awaited open-world game’s budget, <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/gta-6-development-began-in-earnest-in-2020-following-the-massive-success-of-red-dead-redemption-2-take-two-says">suspected to be over $1 billion</a>, or its marketing, which by some estimates is likely to cost another half-billion. Nor is it just a testament to the consumer spending crater that will be left in the wake of its sales, <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/business/2025/08/03/grand-theft-auto-online-safety-laws/">projected by one analyst</a> to be $10 billion over the life of the game, not including any new <em>GTA Online</em> component.</p> <p><em>GTA</em> 6 being the first “AAAAA game” is also a prediction about the way it will funnel humanity’s collective boredom and curiosity into a cultural singularity that trumps everything from 2023’s Barbenheimer to this year’s viral “Coldplay couple.” That’s the growing consensus at least, which grows more conventional with each passing month. And like the bond ratings that gaming’s triple-A shorthand for blockbusters is borrowed from, “AAAAA” is as much a prediction about possible futures as a measurement of current facts.</p>

 <p>Publishers want their games to sell lots of copies and fans want those games to be great or even, in the rarest cases, life changing. But with <em>GTA 6</em> there’s as much a hope that it will be transformative as there is a sense of potential panic if it’s not. After years of being in the driver’s seat, console gaming has stalled out. While industry boosters tout the size of the overall gaming market compared to Hollywood and sports, <a href="https://www.matthewball.co/all/stateofvideogaming2025">growth over the last five years was effectively flat</a>. Social hubs like <em>Roblox</em> surging in popularity is great for their investors, but another sign that traditional gaming is on the back foot.</p> <p>Even outside of the numbers, the PS5 and Xbox Series X/S console cycle has felt surprisingly unexceptional. There have been plenty of great games, sure, but nothing hardware-defining the way some of the biggest hits from the second half of the PS4 and Xbox One era felt. Fans searching for that unmistakable feeling of “next-gen” magic from years past are left to comb over Digital Foundry forensics like lapsed believers threatened by a crisis of faith.</p>

 <p>Consoles increasingly struggle to distinguish themselves in much the same way smartphones keep adding more camera lenses to convince you you’re upgrading more than just RAM. <a href="https://kotaku.com/ps6-leak-specs-sony-handheld-price-release-date-2000614206">The latest leaks</a> suggest the new hardware from from Sony and Microsoft is just a couple of years away and will be even less of a generational leap. And why should they bother if half of their current install base won’t be updating anytime soon? I can’t wait for system architect Mark Cerny to show me how much better Joel and Ellie’s hair looks in <em>The Last of Us Part 1</em> when it gets ported to PS6.</p> <p>What an “AAAAA” rating for<em> GTA 6</em> really means is that it’s the only game people believe can single-handedly shift those trends. Proof of what the PS5 and Xbox Series X/S, the only consoles it’ll be available for at launch, are truly capable of, from <a href="https://kotaku.com/grand-theft-auto-6-gta-vi-new-trailer-gameplay-story-1851779368">cutscene-level shooting animations</a> to <a href="https://kotaku.com/gta-6-trailer-2-beer-graphics-grand-theft-auto-rockstar-1851779653">mouth-watering condensation on beer bottles</a>. A best-seller that doesn’t just move copies of the game but reignites sales in a flagging console race to once again grow the total install base. A sign, perhaps, that the most polished and sophisticated craftsmanship money can buy can once again capture the imagination as much as a crudely <a href="https://kotaku.com/grow-a-garden-roblox-5-million-active-users-record-pc-1851781824">reskinned Cookie Clicker in <em>Roblox</em></a>.</p> <p>Even if <i>GTA 6</i> can shower shareholders with a historic new windfall, if it can’t do those other, grander things it’ll be the surest evidence yet that the “AAA” rating, and the aura farming it does in the video game industry hype cycle, was a junk bond status all along.</p>

              <p><em>Hollow Knight: Silksong&nbsp;</em><a href="https://kotaku.com/silksong-steam-eshop-crashing-twitch-game-pass-hollow-knight-2000623137">may have crashed Steam, PSN, and the Switch eStore with its launch</a>, but that doesn’t seem to have hurt its success any once they all crawled back online. Team Cherry’s enormously anticipated Metroidvania sequel has just reached over half a million concurrent players on Steam alone. That’s a figure that doesn’t include Xbox, PlayStation, or Switch numbers, nor indeed PC players who bought the game on GOG or elsewhere, or who are playing it via Game Pass. It’s fair to say things are going pretty well.</p> <p>At around 10.30 ET this morning, September 4, <em>Kotaku</em> team members began dropping&nbsp;<em>Silksong</em>‘s concurrent player numbers as <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/1030300/charts/">compiled by&nbsp;<em>SteamDB</em></a> into the Slack. 156,271 was the first big number to astonish us. The original&nbsp;<em>Hollow Knight</em>‘s all-time peak was 72,916, and even that was set only yesterday. On release in 2017, it was lucky to see just a thousand, its popularity building up to a big August 2018 spike of 10,000 concurrent players. It took until May 2022 to find 20,000, and only hit those numbers again last month after the announcement of the release date for the long-delayed sequel. I explain all this because it’s fairly important context when looking at the hundreds of thousands who have shown up for <em>Silksong</em>.</p> <p>By 12.30 today, that number had reached 245,587, and it seemed like it might be time to write about hitting a quarter of a million. But the number kept going up. At 1 p.m. it was 382,195, and just six minutes later had risen to over 400,000. At 1.30, 478k, and then at 2 p.m. it reached a ridiculous 534,450. That makes it the game with the 18th highest number of concurrent players on Steam, <em>ever</em>. It just beat the hugely popular&nbsp;<em>Battlefield 6&nbsp;</em>beta weekend into 19th. That, let’s not forget, was a&nbsp;<em>free</em> weekend with a multiplayer game—this is a 2D single-player platformer.</p>

 <p>Of course, a large part of&nbsp;<em>Silksong</em>‘s launch day success is the extraordinary build-up and anticipation it’s received. Absent from industry showcases for years on end, its potential audience became almost cult-like <a href="https://kotaku.com/hollow-knight-silksong-indie-world-showcase-no-show-1851416028">as it endured the long stretch of silence</a>. The original&nbsp;<em>Hollow Knight&nbsp;</em>was much more of a sleeper hit, slowly building its audience and reputation, hence lacking any headline spike at any point over the last eight years. It’ll be interesting to see how long <em>Silksong</em> can maintain this momentum, as people get over the sense of disbelief that it actually really exists and is finally here. The number has started dropping for the first time all day as I’ve written this, just by five thousand or so, but it suggests it’s calming down for the moment. Of course, this could start climbing again once the U.S. workforce that <em>didn’t</em> book the day off are released home to reach their computers and consoles.</p> <p>In the meantime, it strongly suggests that Team Cherry were <a href="https://kotaku.com/silksong-when-release-live-price-hollow-knight-steam-2000621785">very wise to pick the price point that surprised so many</a>. Yes, the game could absolutely have sold incredibly well at $60, based on reputation alone, but going for $20 vastly increases the potential audience who will pay right now, rather than waiting six months for a 90 percent off Steam sale. Given the half a million people simultaneously playing on Steam likely only represents a fraction of those who will have bought the game today, this will be a massive financial success. And we’re just talking about <em>today’s</em> sales.</p> <p>Whether the game’s actually good or not? That, rather intriguingly, is something everyone’s finding out simultaneously today, given no review code was supplied to press. The lines who played a brief demo at Gamescom had an inkling, but it’ll be tomorrow before consensus begins to appear.</p>
