              <p>“Baja Blast has consistently sparked creativity, defied expectations, and continues to be a cornerstone of the Taco Bell experience,” said Taylor Montgomery, chief marketing officer at Taco Bell, in a press release announcing Baja Midnight. Okay, calm down, Taylor. But yeah, I’ll grant you that people like Baja Blast and your newly released passionfruit-infused variation of the soda is pretty dang good.</p> <p><a href="https://www.tacobell.com/newsroom/mountain-dew-baja-midnight">While that press release</a> quote is filled with buzzwords and exaggerations, it is indeed true that the blue tropical spin on Mountain Dew known as Baja Blast has been a part of Taco Bell’s menu for 20 years and is a certified fan favorite that keeps people coming back to the Tex-Mex fast food chain. Given its popularity, it almost feels dangerous for Taco Bell to tinker with that beloved drink. Rarely do things go well when you start messing around with something as old and beloved as Baja Blast. But I’m glad someone did because Mountain Dew Baja Midnight, a new soda that will be available exclusively at Taco Bell, is a tasty spin on one of my favorite sodas. And hey, if you hate it, Baja Blast is still being sold at Taco Bell, too.</p> <p>I visited my local Taco Bell on August 14, the day Baja Midnight was released. Pulling up to the drive-thru thru I was greeted by large signs announcing the arrival of Baja Midnight. The signs were all purple and showed off the new soda, which is also purple. In the press release for the drink, Montgomery called it “Taco Bell purple.” Sure, why not?</p>

 <figure id="attachment_2000618034" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000618034"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000618034">©Taco Bell</figcaption></figure> <p>We pulled up to the drive-thru, I checked in with my app (Yeah, I’m a real Taco Bell sicko) and ordered some food and two big cups of Midnight. They were very purple, as purple and vibrant as the posters and PR images promise. I thought to myself, “Should a human being consume something so unnaturally colored and vibrant?” and then remembered I’ve been drinking energy drinks and eating at Taco Bell for decades now. If that hasn’t killed me, a weirdly purple soda won’t do it.</p> <p>I took my first big sip of Midnight after eating some Taco Bell goodness, and at first, I thought I was just drinking Baja Blast. The new soda is just as sweet and tropical-y as the OG version. Was this some strange prank Taco Bell execs were playing on customers? But a moment later, my taste buds detected the passionfruit flavor. It wasn’t very strong, and I imagine folks who love passionfruit will be disappointed by how subtle it is. For me, it worked quite well. Baja Blast is a perfect soda to pair with Taco Bell’s burritos, tacos, and quesadillas. I was worried that Midnight would ruin that combo. Instead, the subtle passionfruit just offers a new way to experience Baja Blast.</p> <p>In the future, I’ll still continue to order Baja Blast, but I expect that on some trips to Taco Bell, I’ll want to shake things up and Baja Midnight will be there waiting for me, offering up an ever-so-slightly tartier and sweeter spin on the OG drink. So good job, Taylor Montgomery, chief marketing officer at Taco Bell, and everyone else involved. You didn’t ruin Baja Blast and made some nice. Congrats. Now add chips to the Cantina Chicken Bowl, please.</p>

<p>If you’re pining for the days when games like <i>F-Zero</i> and <i>WipEout</i> offered up blistering fast races, then Nintendo Switch 2 launch title <i>Mario Kart World</i> might feel a little slow for you. Worry not, speed demon, as there’s another racer in the launch lineup that might just tickle your fancy. Enter: <i>Fast Fusion</i>.</p> <p>The fourth title in the Fast franchise, <i>Fast Fusion</i> takes everything that has worked well for the series over the past few generations and pumps it up to 4k / 60 fps to provide one of the Nintendo Switch 2’s most attractive and heart-pounding gameplay experiences. Here’s how long it’ll take you to experience this face-melting thrill ride in its entirety, what machines are best, and more.</p> <h2><span id="how-many-tracks-are-in-fast-fusion"></span>How many tracks are in <i>Fast Fusion</i>?<span></span></h2> <p>At launch, <i>Fast Fusion</i> offered 12 different tracks, with half of them originally from 2015’s Wii U title <i>Fast Racing Neo</i>. In late June of this year, developer Shin’en Multimedia released the first of its promised free updates that added an additional six tracks. The update also added a new rendering option and new music.</p>

 <h2><span id="what-are-some-of-the-best-machines/vehicles-in-the-game"></span>What are some of the best machines/vehicles in the game?<span></span></h2> <p>Of the 15 vehicles, or “machines” as the game refers to them, Kamagori, Spaarc, Guang Zhou, Mueller, Cebra, Mech Guyva, and Rochdale &amp; Ziro are all excellent choices. That said, if you’re just starting out, the Cebra is a good way to get a feel for the game.</p> <h2><span id="how-many-people-can-play-at-once"></span>How many people can play at once?<span></span></h2>  <p><i>Fast Fusion</i> supports up to eight players when playing online, and four people can play via split-screen locally on the same Switch 2.</p> <h2><span id="how-long-does-it-take-to-beat-fast-fusion"></span>How long does it take to beat <i>Fast Fusion</i>?<span></span></h2> <p><i>Fast Fusion</i> demands that you become adept at rapidly dodging obstacles, alternating between color modes to match on-track speed boosts, and managing your own personal boost meter. Races in <i>Fast Fusion</i> are extraordinarily fast, and a mere one or two mistakes can cost you the whole race.</p>

 <p>Success and completion in <i>Fast Fusion</i> will come down to how well you can master these intriguing mechanics and overcome its Championship mode. There are multiple cups to beat on your way to finishing this mode, but you can’t just eek your way through them with placement.</p> <p>Instead,<i> Fast Fusion</i> requires you to purchase the Championship mode cups using currency you earn from racing. Since this currency is also used to purchase new vehicles, you’ll probably need to repeat some cups a few times to have enough to unlock everything you need to overcome future cups.</p>

 <p>When you mix <i>Fast Fusion</i>‘s challenging gameplay with a reliance on currency over placement, you get a game with a playtime that is hard to nail down. But if you’re skipping new vehicle purchases and focusing solely on unlocking and finishing cups, <b>you can probably see the end of the Championship mode in 2-3 hours</b>.</p> <p>There’s more to do after you complete Championship mode, however. You can check out Time Attack mode to see how quickly you can clear tracks, or dive into Super Hero mode for a significantly more challenging racing experience. And though <i>Fast Fusion</i>‘s multiplayer functionality leaves a bit to be desired thanks to lack of matchmaking, it can still be a fun diversion with friends.</p> <p>All-in-all, <i>Fast Fusion</i> is a fast, frenetic racing title that offers Nintendo Switch 2 owners something truly nerve-rattling (in a good way) to play on their new hardware. For only $14.99, you could make considerably worse decisions while perusing the eShop.</p> <hr> <p><i>Fast Fusion</i> is available now exclusively on Nintendo Switch 2.</p>

              <p><em>Roblox</em> is possibly the most popular gaming platform on the planet—far more popular than you might think. <a href="https://kotaku.com/grow-a-garden-roblox-5-million-active-users-record-pc-1851781824"><em>Grow a Garden</em></a>, a game built within the app, recently had 21.9 million concurrent players, dwarfing the likes of <em>Fortnite</em> and&nbsp;<em>Counter-Strike 2&nbsp;</em>by multiple times. And that’s despite being an application recently described as <a href="https://kotaku.com/roblox-hindenburg-report-pedophile-hellscape-for-kids-1851668649">“a pedophile hellscape for kids.”</a> Well, it can now add another similar accolade to its collection, as the entire state of Louisiana has announced it’s suing&nbsp;<em>Roblox</em>, calling it “a breeding ground for sex predators.”</p> <p>Louisiana attorney general Liz Murrill announced the action via X, explaining that she’s coming after the gaming platform due to its “lack of safety protocols,” and the claim that this results in danger for children. Which, in most circumstances, might come across as all-too-familiar hyperbole from a member of government looking for a moral panic to latch onto. It’s just, in the case of <em>Roblox</em>, it’s something that’s been demonstrated to be true <a href="https://kotaku.com/its-shocking-just-how-shady-roblox-actually-is-1847522070">over</a> and <a href="https://kotaku.com/roblox-child-account-safety-settings-danger-1851680045">over again</a>. But no matter the accuracy, the question remains: What is the actual, practical purpose of this suit?</p> <p>“<em>Roblox</em> is overrun with harmful content and child predators,” says Murrill, “because it prioritizes user growth, revenue, and profits over child safety. Every parent should be aware of the clear and present danger poised to their children by <em>Roblox</em> so they can prevent the unthinkable from ever happening in their own home.”</p> <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">🚨 BREAKING: Today I’m suing Roblox – the #1 gaming site for children and teens – and a breeding ground for sex predators.</p> <p>Due to Roblox’s lack of safety protocols, it endangers the safety of the children of Louisiana. Roblox is overrun with harmful content and child predators… <a href="https://t.co/p98Sq8vvMb">pic.twitter.com/p98Sq8vvMb</a></p> <p>— Attorney General Liz Murrill (@AGLizMurrill) <a href="https://twitter.com/AGLizMurrill/status/1956081394083409932?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">August 14, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <p><a href="https://aglizmurrill.com/Article/322">The longer statement</a> goes on to describe the motivation behind the suit.</p> <blockquote><p>“Because there is no age minimum and requirement to verify age or parental permission once you sign-up, users can easily say they are younger or older than their actual age – allowing child predators to pose as children and for children to bypass any age requirement.</p> <p>Once registered, users have access to millions of games such as sports, role-playing, naval, fashion, and comedy. Other games which have existed on the platform including Escape to Epstein Island, Diddy Party, and Public Bathroom Simulator Vibe are not as innocent. These games and others are often filled with sexually explicit material and simulated sexual activity such as child gang rape.”</p></blockquote> <p>Again, every muscle in my body wants to type out why this Republican AG is wrong and how she’s willfully misinterpreting the facts to condemn a topic she doesn’t understand…but, well, <a href="https://kotaku.com/roblox-child-account-safety-settings-danger-1851680045">I’ve tested it all for myself</a>, and it’s true. You can absolutely sign up as being any age up to 17 without any verification requirements, and passing as over 17 isn’t a herculean effort. But there’s little need, since many of the violent and sexual games are simply marked as suitable for teens so there’s no restrictions to playing them. Oh, and despite my own son not being allowed to use <em>Roblox&nbsp;</em>(I am the&nbsp;<em>meanest</em> father), his friends do and so I get to hear about “Diddy Party” and the like far more often than anyone could want.</p> <p>Changes were made toward the end of 2024 that added new options for parents, allowing them to prevent their under-13s from being able to use in-game chat features, and that stopped children under 9 from accessing teenage content. However, it’s more extraordinary that even these most basic levels of protection hadn’t been included for the app’s first 18 years. And even in the wake of these changes, there’s still nothing to stop a 13-year-old from accessing very adult content or having un-monitored text communication with anyone. (As a parent of a 10-year-old who plays <em>Gorilla Tag</em> on his VR, I’m acutely aware how much more pernicious text chat is than audio.)</p> <p>Teenage privacy and online communication is a massively fraught and complex subject, one for each family to wrestle with among themselves, but it remains the case that <a href="https://kotaku.com/roblox-hindenburg-report-pedophile-hellscape-for-kids-1851668649">investigations into&nbsp;<em>Roblox</em></a> have found groups “openly trading child pornography and soliciting sexual acts from minors,” even when signed in using under-13 accounts.</p> <p>Now, obviously the vast majority of the 80 million people who play&nbsp;<em>Roblox</em> every day are fine, even if they’re having their precious youths wasted on <a href="https://kotaku.com/steal-a-brainrot-roblox-empire-review-popular-memes-1851787027">Italian Brainrot memes</a>. I think what most people are after is just more effort on the parts of the owners to better protect young users from the <a href="https://www.wafb.com/2025/04/17/man-accused-kidnapping-10-year-old-he-met-roblox-discord/">very obvious harms that are possible</a>. Although given some of <a href="https://kotaku.com/roblox-boss-kids-child-labor-exploit-indonesia-slum-1851387795">the awful things those owners are wont to say</a>, hopes for common sense aren’t high.</p> <p>It’ll be interesting to see what this peculiar lawsuit is intended to achieve. It seems more like attention-seeking noise than anything practical. The article cites the same Hindenburg Research investigation we’ve linked above, and then mentions a recent case in Livingston Parish where a home was raided after someone was trying to lure children via <em>Roblox </em>(we haven’t been able to verify this, and even <a href="https://aglizmurrill.com/Files/Article/322/Documents/RobloxLawsuit.pdf">the text of the official lawsuit</a> doesn’t cite any evidence), before stating, “For these and other reasons,&nbsp;<em>Roblox</em> is in violation of Louisiana law.”</p> <p>Which laws?</p> <p>“The State is seeking permanent injunctive relief and prohibiting them from:</p> <ul> <li>Engaging in any activity in violation of Louisiana Unfair Trade Practices Act:</li> <li>Representing that Roblox has adequate safety features</li> <li>Restitution to the State of Louisiana</li> <li>Attorney’s fees</li> <li>All additional civil penalties allowable under law</li> <li>All additional damages allowable under law”</li> </ul> <p>Presumably there’s a hope that this will force Roblox, the company, to take its responsibilities more seriously, given it cannot control its distribution on a state-by-state level. However, it seems more likely the kerjillion-dollar company will just settle to make it all go away.</p>
