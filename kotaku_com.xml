When she called her dad’s killer “handsome,” something she presumably must have heard from people who saw him doing mass murder, I said “you’re so right, bestie.” I didn’t think much of it at the time, but now that it’s being used as a lead-in to thirst edits, I feel like someone in the writer’s room knew exactly what they were doing.</p><p>In context, the line is kind of silly. Abby, a woman who would go on to lose years of her life to a violent vendetta against this man, pointing out that witnesses also said that he’s good-looking, just feels more like a knowing nod to <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/pedro-pascal-last-of-us-joel-daddy-game-of-thrones-1850013031&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/pedro-pascal-last-of-us-joel-daddy-game-of-thrones-1850013031">the internet’s love of Pascal</a></span> than something Abby would ever care to bring up. Also, like, what Firefly is telling Abby, after the death of her father, that the guy who shot him was a looker? Why would you say that to a child? I’m not alone in that sentiment either, as some viewers <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://x.com/kokureno/status/1911835735591727311&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://x.com/kokureno/status/1911835735591727311" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">have also</a></span> <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://x.com/elliespundit/status/1911916714469601420&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://x.com/elliespundit/status/1911916714469601420" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">expressed their</a></span> <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://x.com/moonsellie/status/1911694928725279176&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://x.com/moonsellie/status/1911694928725279176" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">own disbelief</a></span>. But my issues with the line aside (I swear I’m not gonna be a party pooper all season), the truth of this observation has made it one of the first big inside jokes of the season.</p><p>There are still six episodes to go this season, so there will be plenty more chances for the internet to create more jokes out of the horrible tragedies these characters are about to be put through.
