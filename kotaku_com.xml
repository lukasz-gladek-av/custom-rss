It wasn’t a huge hit compared to other <em>CoD </em>games, not least because the Vita itself wasn’t a big seller. But despite the Vita being a portable console from over a decade ago and<em> Black Ops: Declassified</em> being a oddball spin-off from 2012, there are still enough people playing the FPS in 2025 that you can reportedly boot up a Vita right now and find a match in seconds. </p><p>On January 4, PlayStation content creator Radec posted on Twitter that they were able to boot up a PS Vita and find matches “instantly” in <em>Call of Duty: Black Ops Declassified</em>. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://x.com/realradec/status/1875686080378499148&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://x.com/realradec/status/1875686080378499148" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The tweet went viral</a></span>, likely because a lot of people were surprised to hear that <em>Declassified</em> was still popular and being played in 2025. And I bet some people were just shocked to hear about a PS Vita <em>Call of Duty</em> even existing. </p><p>Radec isn’t the only person reporting this. In the replies to the tweet you can find other players sharing stories of how they just recently booted up the game on their own PS Vita and also found matches quickly. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://x.com/David_Jagneaux/status/1856836194526695884&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://x.com/David_Jagneaux/status/1856836194526695884" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Another player shared how they found matches quickly</a></span> in <em>Declassified </em>in November, saying it only took about 20 seconds to find a full lobby. </p><p>“Legit. Like last month I connected my Vita to my mobile hotspot and checked <em>Black Ops Declassified </em>multiplayer and there were almost full lobbies with all kinds of players,” <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://x.com/RicksterLPs/status/1875813935200530823&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://x.com/RicksterLPs/status/1875813935200530823" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">said another user in response to Radec’s tweet</a></span>. “The best part about the whole experience was there were no hackers. Just people who wanna unwind and play.”</p><p>Declassified isn’t the only old <em>CoD</em> game still being played in 2025. You can still boot up most <em>Call of Duty </em>games released on PS3, Xbox 360, Xbox One, and PS4 and find players instantly. Some people just don’t want to move on. Be warned though, as someone who has done this, the people still playing these older <em>Call of Duty</em> games are veterans who know the maps and weapons incredibly well and you’ll likely get stomped over and over. </p><p>&nbsp; .<br></p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
