              <p>If youâ€™re a fan of LEGO sets featuring Harry Potter, Star Wars, and other pop culture icons, you probably already know they usually become collectibles rather than play sets. But when you must let your imagination run rampant and build anything you can imagine, nothing beats a big box of hundreds of colorful bricks.</p>
<p>With Prime Day coming in October, Amazon just dropped an unbeatable deal on a two-pack of huge LEGO Classic Creative Brick Boxes, which together total nearly 1,600 bricks: <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4350/">The package is available for $78, reduced from the original $120</a>, which makes an all-time low on Amazon.</p>

<h2>Unleash Endless Building Possibilities</h2>
<p>This package has <strong>two large boxes with a total of 790 pieces in 33 different colors</strong>. That variety enables every builder of every age to construct anything ranging from simple toys like houses and scooters to more complex figures and castles. The bricks come with eight types of toy windows and doors to complete your constructions realistically, and six toy tires and wheel rims perfect for cars. These include two green baseplates of differing size-one about 6 inches square and the other, smaller-one-that serve as a stable base for imaginative play scenes.</p>
<p><strong>All the pieces are compatible with every other LEGO building set</strong> so this kit seamlessly fits into and expands your existing collection. Unlike theme-based sets that come with complex instructions and a single-minded focus, this creative brick box is all about open-ended play with no rules or limits. Kids can play with colors and shapes and refine their fine motor skills and spatial awareness in the process.</p>



<p>The packaging itself serves as a <strong>clever storage system</strong>, keeping tidy time simple at home or in the classroom. With <strong>nearly 30,000 reviews averaging 4.8 stars</strong>, customers appreciate the amount and quality of bricks, along with the creative freedom it provides for imaginative building sessions. This makes it a perfect gift option for girls and boys who love hands-on play.</p>
<p>With Prime Day discounts, this set provides you with <strong>double the bricks for close to half the price of one box</strong>. That kind of value is hard to find elsewhere, especially given the prolonged entertainment that you get out of this set. It turns playtime into a creative exercise that involves problem-solving and storytelling in a manner that is beyond a digital device.</p>
