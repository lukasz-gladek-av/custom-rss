            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Back in the day when I used to main <i>Call of Duty</i>’s extraction mode, DMZ, any time my plans to play sniper boss on a tall tower went awry and I had to skedaddle, I’d just leap off of a building and, without much thought or concern, hit the ground and run and hide somewhere. It was cheap. But also, there was an infinite parachute on my back. It was a part of the game. Am I supposed to not use it?</p>

 <p>Well, as we’ve now seen for a little bit, you can kinda sorta do the same thing in <i>Arc Raiders</i>. But instead of an infinite parachute, you can exploit how the game handles characters grabbing onto ledges to fall from incredible heights with basically no harm to your character. It’s not right. I don’t agree with it. You should stop doing it. Camp the extraction point? Fine. But if I see you do this ledge thing from somewhere ridiculous like the skyscraper-sized launch tower in Spaceport, I don’t care if you’re fighting a Leaper or are running from a Rocketeer. I’m hopping on the mic to have a conversation with you about unsportsmanlike conduct.</p>

 <p><b>Read More:</b> <a href="https://kotaku.com/arc-raiders-embark-pvp-toxic-betrayal-leaper-2000640905"><i>Arc Raiders</i>: The Sickest, Silliest, And Most Spectacular Moments From The Game So Far</a></p> <p>I first caught sight of this little exploit back when I wrote up a montage of all the hijinks that <a href="https://kotaku.com/arc-raiders-embark-pvp-toxic-betrayal-leaper-2000640905">unfolded during <i>Arc Raiders</i>’ first weekend</a>. I’d hoped that, amusing as it was to watch, it would be a little too tricky to pull off reliably. Well, no. As <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/third-person-shooter/arc-raiders-players-crack-its-movement-tech-wide-open-by-mastering-the-ledge-grab/">Morgan Park over at <i>PC Gamer</i></a> has documented, folks have figured out how to do this reliably. But unlike my colleague, I don’t find it amusing.</p>

   <p>It essentially works like this: Fall from a great height but be sure there’s a ledge to grab waiting far below. Hold down the jump key or button while you’re falling and you’ll grab the ledge, your character’s arm sockets apparently absorbing the impact of falling from terminal velocity to cancel out all of the fall damage you right earned.</p>

 <p><i>Kotaku</i> has reached out to Embark Studios for comment on this “movement tech.”</p> <p>Don’t get me wrong. I do enjoy a good movement exploit when it feels like it requires a bit of mastery to pull off. “<a href="https://youtu.be/5QYRCVS7ix4">Curb sliding” in <i>Halo Infinite</i></a> (RIP) was one such thing. After sprinting, you could slide off a ledge to get a boost in speed. It was tricky to do, especially amidst the chaos of a good <i>Halo </i>match.</p>

 <p>But I don’t see that kind of skill in this ledge grab trick in <i>Arc Raiders</i>. Being able to bail from a high vantage point without consequence feels a little too easy, and antithetical to the fairly grounded approach to combat <i>Arc Raiders</i> seems to be going for.</p> <p>Ledges and climbing are quite important in <i>Arc Raiders</i>, so much so that the game sometimes reminds me a little bit of <i>Uncharted</i>. As some folks have commented in <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ArcRaiders/comments/1kmrtjt/i_hope_this_doesnt_get_patched/">a Reddit post documenting the ledge-grab exploit</a>, grabbing onto a ledge from a great height is fine, but it shouldn’t cancel out fall damage. Especially when you’re jumping off something as tall as a skyscraper. Such silliness.</p>

              <p>Since the launch of the Nintendo Switch 2 in June, <a href="https://kotaku.com/switch-2-key-card-game-cart-physical-list-confirmed-1851777742">players have been pretty miffed</a> to discover that the physical versions of many games don’t actually contain the game at all. Instead they’re so-called “game-key cards,” essentially a phony game cart that only contains an instruction to download the game from Nintendo’s servers. Until now, it’s something that’s only affected third-party titles, <a href="https://kotaku.com/switch-2-elden-ring-digital-downloads-1851774694">albeit some very big-name games</a>. But now—with March 5, 2026’s <em>Pokémon Pokopia</em>—the phenomenon will seemingly affect a Nintendo-published game for the first time.</p>

 <p>While this isn’t fully confirmed, it’s all but certain after Nintendo simultaneously announced a March 5 release date for the <a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-pokopia-animal-crossing-switch-2-nintendo-direct-2000625331">recently revealed <em>Animal Crossing-</em>like <em>Pokémon Pokopia</em></a>, and a video explaining how game-key cards work that used&nbsp;<em>Pokopia</em> as an example.</p>

  <p>Game-key cards have caused a huge amount of consternation among those who want to be able to simply buy and own a game, knowing it will be theirs and available to play forever. While Xbox and PlayStation consoles have long been plagued by shipping with discs containing just a fraction of a game’s code, or none at all, it’s not something that afflicted Nintendo consoles until the Switch 2. On every previous Nintendo device, if you bought a physical game for it, you can still install and play it today, going right back to the Game Boy. But no longer. And it’s seemingly happening for incredibly stupid reasons.</p>

 <p>For reasons no one but Nintendo seems to know, <a href="https://gamerant.com/nintendo-switch-2-cartridges-new-size-capacity/">the Switch 2 only offers 64GB carts to publishers</a> for their games to ship on, with the price (according to&nbsp;<em>Digital Foundry</em>) set at $23 a piece. That’s far bigger than most people need, and obliterates profits, so with Nintendo offering no other options, publishers are naturally picking the only other option, the fake carts. (In other cases, <a href="https://kotaku.com/star-wars-outlaws-switch-2-game-key-card-2000623413">like&nbsp;<em>Star Wars Outlaws</em></a>, it’s about transfer speeds from the cart to the system without installing on the Switch 2’s SSD.)</p>

 <p>It’s absolutely fascinating that it’s only now that Nintendo intends to use a game-key card for the first time that the company has felt the need to explain them to its audience. In the jaunty video, it explains how it’s selling you an empty box as if it’s doing you a favor, using <em>Pokémon Pokopia</em><em>&nbsp;</em>as its example throughout. The game, which is “only” 10GB, would therefore also make using the 64GB carts extremely expensive, even for Nintendo, a fact which is likely driving this decision. But, you ask, why not just make cheaper 16GB and 32GB carts, too? Well, yes, great question.</p>

 <p>So why buy the boxes at all, if all you’re doing is adding an extra series of steps and a huge amount of wasteful plastic and shipping to what amounts to just downloading a game anyway? Well, the one advantage that remains is that you can—for now—use the same game-key card in a different Nintendo Switch 2, and thus share your game with your friends without having to go through that god-awful time-limited digital sharing feature that was added to the console. You can even (audible gasp) sell them when you’re done.</p> <p>However, it remains a massive disappointment that now even Nintendo is using this preservation-destroying option for its first-party titles. The day the servers are switched off, which we know will be far too soon, none of these carts will do a single thing and the game you bought will be lost forever.</p>

              <p>Is Jesus now canon in <em>Game of Thrones</em>? Will we get a surprise <em>Final Fantasy XIII</em> announcement at this week’s PlayStation State of Play? And why are video game genre names usually terrible? Welcome to the latest edition of Morning Checkpoint, <em>Kotaku</em>‘s daily roundup of gaming news and culture. I purchased <em>Star Wars: Rogue Squadron</em> last night and have been having the time of my life. I also re-watched <em>Episode 2: Attack of the Clones</em> and was much less impressed. It remains the worst <em>Star Wars</em> movie by far.</p> <p>Outline</p> <h2>A Lannister always pays his AI</h2> <p>“So just to let y’all know the new [<em>A Feast For Crows</em>] illustrated edition is like almost definitely ai lol and id argue has taken pretty hard ’inspiration’ from existing fanart,” X user <span>novembernatten <a href="https://x.com/novembernatten/status/1986109371177181669">wrote</a> in a post that blew up last week (via <a href="https://www.thegamer.com/game-of-thrones-ai-art-controversy-a-feast-for-crows-artist-responds-denies/"><em>TheGamer</em></a>). They weren’t the only one throwing around accusations of generative AI, and now the publisher has stepped in to tell fans they’re wrong.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="ht" dir="ltr">lol. lmao, even <a href="https://t.co/YYwEO911nb">pic.twitter.com/YYwEO911nb</a></p> <p>— 2åse (@novembernatten) <a href="https://twitter.com/novembernatten/status/1986109385383330281?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 5, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <p>“Recently there have been accusations floating around that the Penguin Random House’s illustrated edition of <em>A Feast For Crows</em> was produced using AI generative art,” Raya Golden, responsible for<em> Song of Fire and Ice</em> book materials, <a href="https://georgerrmartin.com/notablog/2025/11/10/ffc-art-accusations/">wrote</a> on George R.R. Martin’s blog yesterday. “To our knowledge and as presented by the artist who completed the work in question there was NO such programing used. While he is a digital multimedia artist and relies on digital programing to complete his work, he has expressed unequivocally that no AI was used, and we believe him.”</p>

 <p>Fans remain unconvinced, however. <a href="https://x.com/Mayham_H/status/1988054172613120286">They point to</a> an apparent crucifix that blurrily appears in the background of one of the scenes. “Uh. Then why are they all in blue?” <a href="https://x.com/andrewhunt_/status/1988046433899999721">wrote</a> one. “Why is there a cross on a wall? Why is Tywin obviously an AI recreation of Viserys? Why is there no heraldry? It genuinely could not be more obvious and no amount of lying is gonna work.” Is this a case of AI slop or just bad art?</p>

 <h2>Is <em>Final Fantasy XIII</em> finally getting ported?</h2> <p>That’s the wishcasting from some fans after discovering a <em>Final Fantasy XIII</em> voice actor will be <a href="https://x.com/Genki_JPN/status/1988112940428587350">MC-ing the PlayStation Japan State of Play</a> this week. It might just be cope, but a trilogy ported to PlayStation 5 (and Switch 2) would be pretty awesome. It’s the only major <em>Final Fantasy</em> arc that’s not playable on Sony’s current hardware.</p>

 <h2>Former <em>Marathon</em> dev thinks “extraction” is a bad genre name</h2> <p>Ex-Bungie production manager Chris Sides told the Shooter Monthly podcast it’s “dumb. “I hate the genre name of extraction shooter,” he said (via <a href="https://www.pcgamesn.com/marathon/extraction-shooter"><em>PCGamesN</em></a>). “When I was working on <em>Marathon</em>, I was working with marketing, dying to be like, ‘Can we please create a different genre name?’ because extraction shooter is so dumb. It’s the only genre where its name is a mechanic.”</p>

 <p>He continued, “I cannot stand the name of it. So I think that when you say the extraction genre, it should hit your spot. I think it’s really the fact that the genre doesn’t even know what it is. You, as a player, how do you know what you’re going to get? And I think that’s one of the real issues with the genre itself.”</p>

 <h2><em>Battlefield 6</em>‘s nasty drone glitch has finally been fixed</h2> <p>Players will no longer be able to <a href="https://kotaku.com/battlefield-6-drone-glitch-fix-patch-ruining-matches-update-2000641355">take to the skies and rain down death</a>. “Fixed an exploit allowing players to ascend and access unintended areas when standing on a XFGM-6D Recon Drone by hitting it with the Sledgehammer,” EA’s developers confirmed in the <a href="https://x.com/BattlefieldComm/article/1987957508426608743">latest patch notes</a>.</p> <h2>Switch 2 gets some nifty new features</h2> <p>A <a href="https://en-americas-support.nintendo.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/68473/~/system-update-information-for-nintendo-switch%26nbsp%3B2">new firmware update</a> made small but notable tweaks to the new console. Those include updated game card icons to make it clear when an installation is from a physical or digital purchase, the ability to cancel multiple game downloads at once, and an option to keep the system from going into rest mode while GameChat is active. Most importantly, perhaps, there’s now an “Improved the screen display when using Adjust Screen Size to make it easier to adjust.” Hopefully, that makes it easier to fix the system’s poor HDR implementation.</p> <h2>ICYMI:</h2> <ul> <li><a href="https://kotaku.com/elder-scrolls-6-tes6-shadow-drop-todd-howard-release-date-fallout-3-2000642434">We’ll probably get <em>Fallout 3</em> remastered before <em>The Elder Scrolls 6</em></a></li> <li><a href="https://kotaku.com/goodnight-universe-review-before-your-eyes-webcam-baby-2000642517">The developers behind a radically innovative 2021 indie game are back with something more mixed</a></li> <li><a href="https://kotaku.com/trap-plan-marketing-astroturf-warrobots-fake-reddit-accounts-posts-2000642503">A game company gloats about an astroturfed marketing campaign on Reddit</a></li> </ul> <h2>Watch this:</h2>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Nintendo and Lego are teasing another <a href="https://kotaku.com/the-legend-of-zelda-games-ranked-from-worst-to-best-1792136643"><em>The Legend of Zelda</em></a> collaboration for 2026. There’s no price tag or description yet but we did get a neat little live-action tease recreating the end of <em>Ocarina of Time</em>.</p> <p>The scene shows Link in his classic green tunic with the Master Sword and Hyrulian shield standing in the ruins of the castle with Princess Zelda in the background. Navi hovers nearby as a shadow creeps up and Ganon’s theme plays, suggesting the Lego set might be a depiction of the final battle from the classic Nintendo 64 game.</p>   <p>The other big question, aside from what the set will be, is how much it will cost. Lego has been aggressively burrowing <a href="https://kotaku.com/legos-new-400-star-trek-enterprise-set-price-release-date-mini-figs-2000641658">into fan nostalgia</a> and bank accounts in recent years with licensed sets that cost as much as some video game consoles. The Great Deku Zelda Lego set <a href="https://kotaku.com/nintendo-lego-legend-zelda-great-deku-tree-set-price-1851503670">arrived back</a> in 2024 for $300. At 2,500 pieces it was no small set, but it was also the same price as a Nintendo Switch (less now due to the latter going up in price earlier this year).</p> <p>It seems like Lego is at least sticking with the <em>Ocarina </em>era for the follow-up and bringing Ganon into the mix this time. They might as well keep going and give us Zora’s Domain, Death Mountain, Gerudo Valley, Hyrule Castle, and the rest of Kokiri Forest. Personally, I’d love a Lego recreation of Clock Town from <em>Majora’s Mask</em>. I’m sure both companies can get to that eventually. Nintendo has its <a href="https://kotaku.com/zelda-movie-delay-date-nintendo-avengers-secret-wars-1851784080">live-action <em>Zelda</em> movie</a> coming in 2027.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>As the days get shorter and the weather gets colder, it’s going to be more and more difficult to stay motivated to keep in shape and stick to running throughout the winter. One thing that keeps me going is that I use my runs as my podcast time. Been working my way through the third campaign in&nbsp;<em>Not Another D&amp;D Podcast</em> and four days a week, I’m out running and listening. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5452/">My pair of OpenRun Pro headphones from Shokz are perfect for the job. Right now, they happen to be on sale over at Amazon for 31% off</a>. The brings them down from $180 to just $125. You end up saving yourself a solid $55.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5452/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>



<h2>Bone Conduction Listening</h2>
<p>These headphones are different from your standard earbuds in that they don’t go in your ear. They sit around your ears and deliver sound using bone conduction. By vibrating your skull, you get the perception of sound.&nbsp; Elder millennial like myself might remember this tech from those <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3ca4tfXefk">lollipops in the 90s</a> that could play hit music when you put them in your mouth. Though unlike those, these play music, audiobooks, or podcasts through your cheekbones, not your teeth.</p>
<p>The main advantage to designing headphones this way is it keeps your ears free to hear the various sounds in your environment, keeping you alert of your surroundings. This is crucial while running in case, say, a car is approaching. You’re going to want to hear traffic for safety reasons.</p>
<p>The Shokz OpenRun Pro headphones sit comfortably on your ears like a backwards pair of sunglasses. They feature a lightweight, wraparound titanium frame which helps keep your headphones firmly in place during high intensity workouts. I much prefer this to in-ear buds so I can eliminate any fear of one falling out while on a run.</p>



<p>Battery life is reliable. You can expect a full 10 hours of listening time on a single charge. The OpenRun Pro headphones can recharge fast, providing up to 1.5 hours of listening time after being plugged in for only five minutes.</p>
<p>Shokz also offers a mini model which has a shortened connecting band that stretches around the back for smaller heads. The standard model measures across at 20.7 cm while the mini is 21 mm (or 0.83 inches) shorter at 18.6 cm. Check the product page or the Shokz website for instructions on how to decide which model is best for you.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5452/">Thankfully, both the standard and mini version are seeing the same discount.</a> The standard comes in black, beige, or blue. While the mini has the same color options, the beige and blue appear to be out of stock at the moment.</p>

              <p>Amazon just cut the price on what runners everywhere call their favorite workout companion: The<a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5452/"> Shokz OpenRun Pro bone conduction headphones have dropped to $124, down from their usual $179 price tag</a>. These aren’t your standard issue earbuds that block out the world around you: they use bone conduction technology to deliver audio through your cheekbones while keeping your ears completely open. It’s a design that makes them a go-to for runners who need to stay aware of traffic, fellow joggers, and their surroundings without sacrificing their workout playlist.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5452/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>



<h2>Why Choose Bone Conduction Over Traditional Earbuds</h2>
<p>The OpenRun Pro takes a fundamentally different tack with workout audio: traditional earbuds create a seal in your ear canal which might be OK on the gym floor but becomes a serious safety hazard when you take your runs outdoors. These <strong>headphones perch on your cheekbones and transmit sound through bone conduction</strong> and leave your ear canals wide open. You hear your music, podcasts, or calls clearly while simultaneously hearing cars approaching, cyclists calling out, or someone trying to get your attention on the trail.</p>
<p>The 9th generation represents years of refinement in bone conduction technology: They’re the first Shokz headphones built to take advantage of <em>TurboPitch</em> technology, a design that confronts the main critique of bone conduction models of the past. The <strong>bass response feels full and rich rather</strong> than tinny or weak. You get clear vocals across your favorite tracks, powerful volume when you need to bear down during tough intervals, and surprisingly deep low-end frequencies that other bone conduction models struggled to deliver.</p>



<p>The physical design solves problems that plague conventional workout headphones: <strong>A wraparound titanium frame weighs almost nothing</strong> but provides serious durability. This lightweight, titanium construction flexes to fit different head sizes without creating pressure points. The frame keeps the headphones locked in position through sprints, burpees, or mountain climbs during intense training sessions</p>
<p>Battery performance matches the requirements of the most serious athletes: The <strong>ten hours of continuous playback</strong> will handle everything from marathon training runs to full days of back-to-back activities. You charge them once and don’t worry about battery anxiety for days of normal use. The Quick Charge feature proves super-practical when you forget to plug them in overnight. <strong>Just five minutes charging gives you 1.5 hours of battery life</strong>.</p>
<p>The <strong>sweat-resistant construction</strong> handles whatever your workout throws at it. These headphones resist humid summer runs, aggressive HIIT sessions, and rainy morning jogs without degradation in performance.</p>
<p>At $124, these headphones cost less than most premium traditional sports earbuds and offer better situational awareness.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>With us rushing right through to the end of the year, we find ourselves only a couple short weeks before one of the biggest savings events of the year — Black Friday and Cyber Monday. This will be a great time to save on a new TV, some kitchenware, or perhaps a new laptop. Even though we’re not quite there yet, you can already find some pretty lucrative deals and discounts ahead of schedule. Take a look at this IdeaPad Slim 3 laptop from Lenovo. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5451/">Amazon has it listed at $1,700, but current 62% discount ends up taking over a thousand dollars off the top. You only have to pay $650 for a limited time.</a></p>
<p>Ok so wait a minute. How can this possibly be $1,050 off. That seems too good to be true. Well, if we take a look at the price history, we can see that this laptop has only been listed by this seller since the beginning of this month. After a few days of being full price, it got this massive cut, bringing it to the level it is now. And if we look at Lenovo’s own website, we can find a similarly-specced IdeaPad Slim 3 going for just $660.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5451/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>



<p>So what gives? Well, lots of independent sellers like to artificially inflate the base price of their products so they can give them a huge markdown, giving the illusion of a great deal. And that’s a shame because this laptop is already a great value at this price.</p>
<h2>Diving Into the Specs</h2>
<p>What you get is an ultra-slim, lightweight laptop with a 15.3-inch screen powered by an AMD Ryzen 5 7535HS processor with an integrated graphics card. The Amazon listing does call it out as a gaming laptop, but the IdeaPad Slim 3 is better suited as a general-use laptop for everyday users. It still might be able to handle some lighter games that aren’t so graphically intensive. The laptop includes a full keypad, featuring a number pad which is a welcomed addition for anyone crunching numbers all day long.</p>



<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5451/">The laptop is working with 24GB of memory and a 1TB PCIe NVMe SSD for storage. It’s got support for Wi-Fi 6 for fast and stable internet speeds.</a> The ports along the side include two USB-A slots, a USB-C slot, an HDMI so you can connect to a second display, an SD card reader (great for photographers to have handy), and a classic 3.5mm headphone and microphone combination jack.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><span>It’s been almost four years since </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/sony-ps5-destiny-2-bungie-playstation-microsoft-xbox-ex-1848453326"><span>Sony acquired Bungie</span></a><span>, the developers of </span><i><span>Destiny 2 </span></i><span>and the creators of Microsoft’s flagship franchise </span><i><span>Halo, </span></i><span>for a whopping $3.6 billion. Now, as we approach the fourth anniversary of that transaction, it looks like Sony isn’t satisfied with the monetary return, as the company’s CFO and Corporate Executive Officer, Lin Tao, revealed that </span><i><span>Destiny 2 </span></i><span>has not met the PlayStation maker’s expectations.</span></p>

 <p><span>In Sony’s Q2 Fiscal Year 2025 earnings call (thanks, </span><a href="https://thisweekinvideogames.com/news/destiny-2-hasnt-reached-sonys-expectations-for-bungie-acquisition-says-cfo/"><i><span>This Week in Video Games</span></i></a><span>), Tao spoke about </span><i><span>Destiny 2</span></i><span> and said that its sales and player engagement have “not reached the expectations [Sony] had at the time of the acquisition of Bungie.”&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><span>“While we will continue to make improvements, we downwardly revised the business projection for the time being, and recorded an impairment loss against a portion of the assets at Bungie,” Tao said through an English translator.</span></p> <p><i><span>Destiny 2</span></i><span> is one side of Bungie’s business right now, while the other is the upcoming extraction shooter </span><i><span>Marathon</span></i><span>, which has faced some </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/marathon-alpha-review-impressions-bungie-extraction-fps-1851777775"><span>middling reception during its testing phase</span></a><span>. For now, Sony seems intent on releasing the game within this fiscal year, meaning sometime before March 2026. </span><i><span>Marathon</span></i><span> was </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/marathon-delay-bungie-feedback-prox-chat-solo-update-1851784674"><span>indefinitely delayed earlier this year to address feedback</span></a><span>, so it has no set launch date at this time. Bungie recently concluded another testing phase in October, and </span><a href="https://thisweekinvideogames.com/news/sony-cfo-on-bungies-marathon-as-needed-we-will-make-corrections/"><span>Tao says</span></a><span> the company is in the “process of analyzing the performance against [its internal] KPIs.”</span></p>

 <p><span>“We are fully dedicated to launching the title to schedule,” Tao said. “We will assume that we will launch this within this (financial) year, and that is included in the forecast.”</span></p> <p><span>While </span><i><span>Destiny 2</span></i><span> might be struggling in Sony’s eyes, Tao did say games like </span><i><span>Helldivers 2</span></i><span> and </span><i><span>MLB: The Show 25</span></i><span> have performed well, as far as the live-service section of the business goes. </span><i><span>Ghost of Yotei</span></i><span> has also sold 3.3 million copies since its launch last month, so PlayStation games are seeing some notable success in 2025.</span></p> <p><span>Bungie has been a big pillar of Sony’s </span><a href="https://thisweekinvideogames.com/news/sony-cfo-on-bungies-marathon-as-needed-we-will-make-corrections/"><span>attempts at carving a space in the live-service games market</span></a><span>, but the studio has been mired in controversy in the years since the acquisition. From </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/destiny-3-cancel-final-shape-expansions-bungie-payback-1851612404"><span>canceled projects</span></a><span> to </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/bungie-layoffs-destiny-2-final-shape-marathon-sony-ps5-1851609905"><span>widespread layoffs</span></a><span>, Bungie has been publicly struggling for a few years now, and things are </span><a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/bungie-devs-say-atmosphere-is-soul-crushing-amid-layoffs-cuts-and-fear-of-total-sony-takeover"><span>reportedly not great privately, either</span></a><span>. CEO Pete Parsons left the studio after 23 years </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/bungie-pete-parsons-halo-destiny-2-sony-2000619244"><span>back in August</span></a>.</p>
