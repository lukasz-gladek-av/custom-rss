Still, it is fun to walk into a room and shoot 20 random thugs with a big pistol. So that’s something. </p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="197589" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="Ring Psychology: Understanding The 6 Phases Of A Wrestling Match Through Heel Era John Cena" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="659" data-playlist="197589,197586,197585" data-current="197589"><div><p>Ring Psychology: Understanding The 6 Phases Of A Wrestling Match Through Heel Era John Cena</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197589/197589_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197589/197589_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197589/197589_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/23110.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/best-robocop-game-rogue-city-sequel-expansion-2025-pc-1851768472&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/best-robocop-game-rogue-city-sequel-expansion-2025-pc-1851768472"><em>Unfinished Business</em></a></span><em> </em>opens in a really depressing way. Set after the events of the last game, it kicks off with an attack on the police station—which served as one of your central hubs in <em>Rogue City—</em>that leaves many of the NPCs from that game dead. A few of the main characters from the movies, like Officer Lewis, survive, point RoboCop in the direction of a big tower filled with mercenaries who were likely responsible, and then don’t show up again for hours and hours. It’s like<em> Unfinished Business</em> wants to remind players of the more varied world and characters of the last game before it dumps you into the boring corridors of OmniTower. </p><p>Once in OmniTower, <em>Unfinished Business</em> tasks you with reaching the upper levels of the massive structure. But between RoboCop and his goal are hundreds of bots and mercs ready to kill the shiny hero. While<em> Rogue City</em> featured plenty of first-person combat,<em> Unfinished Business</em> features loads more. This is  mostly an action game, whereas the last one could be charitably described as a low-budget spin on a Bethesda game.</p><p>Thankfully, gunning down creeps and saving hostages is still a blast in <em>Unfinished Business</em>. And a few new weapons, along with the ability to use the environment to take down baddies—like shoving someone down a garbage chute—help spice things up. But I really hope you liked the shooty-shooty bits from <em>Rogue City</em> because <em>Unfinished Business</em> is mostly that. </p><p>In <em>Rogue City</em>, I fell in love with a little slice of Old Detroit as I patrolled it, completed side missions, met various characters, and helped protect them. That’s all gone in <em>Unfinished Business</em>. There are still side quests and characters to meet, but most of them are left behind between levels as you keep moving up. Instead of a small slice of urban decay that you can grow to love, <em>Unfinished Business</em> gives you oh so many grey corridors and rooms. Thanks? </p><p>All the RPG systems from<em> Rogue City</em> are back in <em>Unfinished Business,</em> which does help add more to this game and keep it from being just a straight-up linear shooter, but compared to what came before, it’s disappointing. A few moments where you get to play as a pre-RoboCop Alex Murphy are neat, but don’t add much to the experience. </p><p>Hopefully, the devs behind <em>Unfinished Business</em> and <em>Rogue City </em>have a proper sequel in the works that brings back the open-world RPG formula that made that last game so charming and memorable. </p><p> .<br></p></div></div><br/><br/>https://kotaku.com/robocop-rogue-city-unfinished-business-expansion-review-1851786534]]></content:encoded>

You probably hear the name SonicFox and immediately think of the professional fighting game player, but might not recognize their real name, Dominique McLean. The practice is probably good for brand awareness, as a lot of esports players have digital handles on social media, but it also means that a lot of players will just go by whatever they want. That includes a <em>PUBG Mobile </em>player from India named Subhash Bediya, who, up until this month, was using the handle “Hitler” as a member of a team called “Aryan.” Today, July 17, the player put out a public apology and changed his handle to “Henry.”</p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="197589" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="Ring Psychology: Understanding The 6 Phases Of A Wrestling Match Through Heel Era John Cena" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="659" data-playlist="197589,197586,197585" data-current="197589"><div><p>Ring Psychology: Understanding The 6 Phases Of A Wrestling Match Through Heel Era John Cena</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197589/197589_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197589/197589_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197589/197589_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/23110.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>Bediya posted a message on his <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.instagram.com/p/DMNNOBKvBX2/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.instagram.com/p/DMNNOBKvBX2/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Instagram account</a></span> confirming the name change and saying he used the handle “without fully considering the weight and historical pain” associated with the name of the leader of Nazi Germany.
