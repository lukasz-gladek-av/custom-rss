            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>This is the first year that Apple has put all of its Watch models on sale at the same time on Black Friday: This includes the rugged Watch Ultra model for extreme sports, the standard Series models, and the SE models that are focused on value. This all-encompassing sale strategy gives people access to Apple’s wearable ecosystem in ways that have never been possible before, since Apple usually keeps prices high except for short promotional periods (and mainly on Amazon).</p>
<p>Since this morning, <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6066/">the price of the Apple Watch SE 3 with 44mm GPS (and sport band) on Amazon dropped from $279 to $229</a>. This is the lowest price ever with an 18% discount that makes it a good choice against affordable Samsung and Garmin watches at similar prices. Amazon went above and beyond the usual Black Friday discounts, making the Apple Watch SE 3 the <strong>best-selling smartwatch on the main Black Friday day</strong>.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6066/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Always-On Display</h2>
<p>The <strong>always-on Retina display is the SE 3’s biggest improvement</strong> over the SE 2: It gets rid of the need to raise your wrist which made previous models feel half-functional when you just wanted to check the time. It also means that you can check notifications during meetings without the obvious wrist flick that says you’re looking at your watch, or keep track of your workout metrics without waking up the screen by making big movements.</p>



<p>The <strong>temperature sensing lets you look back at ovulation estimates</strong> by taking nightly wrist temperature readings that show patterns that point to fertile windows. This makes natural family planning tools or fertility awareness that dedicated ovulation trackers offer at similar prices. The <em>Vitals</em> app combines temperature, heart rate, respiratory rate, and sleep data into unified health dashboards that show patterns that individual metrics don’t show. <strong>Daily sleep scores measure the quality of your sleep</strong> by looking at how long you sleep, how consistently you sleep, and how your body works.</p>
<p>The new <strong>battery lasts 18 hours on a single charge and has an always-on display</strong> so you can use it all day, from waking up to going to sleep, without having to charge it in the middle of the day, which makes sleep tracking impossible. Fast charging gives you 8 hours of battery life in just 15 minutes, so you can quickly charge it up while you shower or get ready in the morning. The battery lasts twice as long as the SE 2’s and the new charging architecture makes it charge twice as fast.</p>
<p>The <strong>Apple Intelligence-powered Workout Buddy looks at your past workouts to give you personalized coaching</strong>, changing goals, and real-time support that keeps you motivated during tough sessions. The feature learns how well you usually do and changes its suggestions based on that, so you don’t get the unrealistic goals that generic fitness apps give you without knowing what you can really do.</p>



<p>The <strong>crash and fall detection features use data from the accelerometer and gyroscope</strong> to look for serious impacts or dangerous falls. If you don’t respond after an incident, they will automatically call emergency services. The safety features are especially useful for people who do things alone, like running on remote trails, biking on busy streets, or older people who are more likely to fall.</p>
<p>The record-low Black Friday pricing at $229 makes Apple’s latest Watch SE 3 model cost similarly to Samsung and Garmin alternatives but they offer better ecosystem integration, safety features and seamless iPhone connectivity that Android watches cannot match. The combination of always-on display, temperature sensing, 18-hour battery and Apple Intelligence features at 18% below retail creates exceptional value.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Microsoft Goes Zero-Profit on Surface Laptop (1TB SSD, X Elite, 15″), Now $700 Off in Black Friday’s Final Hours]]></title>
            <link>https://kotaku.com/microsoft-goes-zero-profit-on-surface-laptop-1tb-ssd-x-elite-15-now-700-off-in-black-fridays-final-hours-2000648487</link>
            <guid>1367839</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>For the last few hours of Black Friday, Microsoft has decided to go all out by cutting prices even more on its Surface laptop line (the Surface Pro tablets are getting the same treatment on Amazon). There is only one model that is 41% off the original price, and it is this <strong>powerful 15-inch Surface Laptop with a Snapdragon X Elite processor, 16GB of RAM, and a huge 1TB SSD</strong>. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6068/">Instead of the usual $1,699, this Copilot+ PC costs $999 ($700 off)</a> which puts it in the premium range without the high price tag. This isn’t just another laptop deal: it’s <strong>Microsoft’s first big step into AI-enhanced computing</strong> for regular people and the hardware that comes with it actually lives up to those promises.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6068/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Snapdragon Power Lasts All Day</h2>
<p>This Surface laptop has a<strong> Snapdragon X Elite processor, which is a big change from Intel or AMD chips</strong>. Microsoft says that it works better than the MacBook Air M3. Benchmarks show that it does, but the 12-core architecture makes it surprisingly easy to do more than one thing at once. When you have a lot of browser tabs open, music streaming, and documents open at the same time, you’ll notice this the most. The built-in NPU (Neural Processing Unit) is what really makes it better because it <strong>does AI tasks locally instead of sending data to cloud servers</strong>: This means that features like real-time translation and image processing will work faster, and your data will be safer because it stays on your device. And the good news is that you don’t need to be<strong> connected to the internet all the time to use the AI features that come with Copilot+</strong>.</p>



<p>It can<strong> last up to 20 hours on a single charge</strong> which is longer than most Windows laptops in this category. You can really get through a whole day of meetings, presentations, and editing documents without having to look for outlets. The Snapdragon architecture makes it more efficient because it uses less power than older x86 processors.</p>
<p>The<strong> 15-inch touchscreen display uses HDR technology</strong> to make the brightness levels high enough to work outside. The ultra-thin bezels make the most of the screen space without making the laptop bigger, and the colors are bright without being too bright. When using Windows 11’s touch-optimized interface, the touch functionality responds right away, which is more important than you might think.</p>



<p>Windows Studio Effects changes video calls by changing the lighting in real time, blocking out background noise, and blurring the mess behind you. These features run on the NPU instead of your main processor, so they don’t slow down calls. The <strong>live translation feature works in 44 languages</strong> and makes subtitles for video calls and streaming content in real time. It’s processing everything on your own computer so there won’t be any lag and you won’t have to worry about sending your conversations through outside servers.</p>
<p>Right now, you get specs that would normally cost well into four figures for $999: Just the 16GB of RAM and 1TB of storage are worth a lot, and that’s before you even think about the display quality and battery life. This setup gets rid of the usual trade-offs: you don’t have to choose between storage space and budget, and you don’t have to give up RAM to get good battery life. Microsoft has called this their flagship AI laptop, and the Black Friday sale makes it competitive with mid-range laptops that can’t match its features.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/sonos-arc-ultra-soundbar-drops-to-new-record-low-9-1-4-surround-sound-budget-bars-will-never-replicate-2000648474</link>
            <guid>1367818</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Budget soundbars that cost between $100 and $200 make bad TV speakers sound better by adding basic audio enhancements. However, they are still limited by cheap drivers, low processing power and simple audio architectures that make sound louder without actually improving quality. Premium soundbars like the <strong>Sonos Arc Ultra</strong> cost more because they use acoustic engineering that rivals dedicated home theater systems, and they have advanced driver arrays, proprietary technologies like Sound Motion that change the way speakers work, and processing that can make real spatial audio instead of just fake effects.</p>
<p>Right now,<a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6065/"> the Sonos Arc Ultra is on sale for $879 on Amazon on Black Friday, down from $1,099</a> and it is a record-low 20% discount that makes Sonos’s flagship soundbar available at prices close to those of mid-range options that don’t perform as well. The <strong>9.1.4 channel Dolby Atmos</strong> makes soundscapes that sound like they’re coming from above, beside and behind you. No matter what the marketing says, budget bars can’t do this.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6065/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Sound Motion Technology</h2>
<p>The proprietary Sound Motion transducers use new architecture to move air more efficiently in much smaller sizes, getting rid of the need for traditional cone-based speaker design. This new technology makes it possible to fit more powerful drivers into slim soundbar profiles without the big boxes that physics usually requires for good bass reproduction. The end result is a small unit that sits quietly under TVs and fills the room with sound, unlike bulky alternatives that need their own furniture to be placed in front of them.</p>



<p>The 9.1.4 channel setup with 14 carefully placed drivers makes real overhead sound effects that put helicopters, rain, and other sounds above the listener instead of just pretending to do so with psychoacoustic tricks. Dolby Atmos content mixed for height channels shows details and immersion that stereo soundbars can’t reproduce. This changes action scenes, nature documentaries, and atmospheric thrillers by using directional audio that matches what you see. The spatial accuracy lets you hear exactly where sounds are coming from in three-dimensional space, as opposed to the vague left-center-right positioning that flat soundbars give you.</p>
<p>AI-powered Speech Enhancement looks at conversations in real time to make voices clearer without making everything sound fake or compressed, like basic “voice mode” settings on cheap soundbars. The processing finds the frequencies of human voices and boosts them while leaving music and effects alone. This keeps the audio balanced instead of making everything sound like talk radio. This is very helpful during movies when mumbled dialogue or strong accents make sense without needing subtitles or having to change the volume all the time.</p>
<p>The Sonos app uses Trueplay room calibration to look at the acoustics of your room and find the best EQ settings for it by measuring how sound bounces off of walls, furniture, and other surfaces. Trueplay will record sound from different places while you walk around with your phone. Then, you’ll see how automatic adjustments fix problems in the room that would make static settings sound bad. To keep the sound from being too harsh, hard-surfaced rooms get treble reduction. To make up for this, carpeted rooms get boosts. This makes sure that the sound is always the best it can be, no matter what kind of interior design choices you make that affect acoustics.</p>
<p>The HDMI eARC connection lets you listen to lossless audio formats like Dolby TrueHD and DTS-HD Master Audio, which streaming services compress into lossy formats. This means you can hear the full quality of Blu-ray collections or high-bitrate streaming sources. The single cable makes setup easier than optical connections with limited bandwidth, and the fact that it works with TV remotes means you don’t have to learn new controls or deal with multiple remotes, which can make setting up a budget soundbar more difficult.</p>
<p>Adding a Sonos Sub for deep bass and Era 300 rear speakers for true surround sound makes systems that are as good as home theater systems that cost $5,000 or more, but are much cheaper and easier to set up. You can start with just the Arc Ultra and then add more pieces as your budget allows, instead of having to buy the whole system all at once. Because the components connect wirelessly, you don’t have to run speaker wires across rooms, which makes installing traditional surround systems a nightmare.</p>
<p>The soundbar is more than just a TV sound enhancer because it can stream music over WiFi, Bluetooth, AirPlay 2, and Spotify Connect. The sound quality when playing music is as good as that of dedicated wireless speakers, which makes systems that combine TV sound and music into one platform. With multi-room audio, you can add Sonos speakers to different rooms in your home so that they all play the same thing or you can control each room separately.</p>
<p>The sleek design, with clean lines, high-quality materials, and little branding, fits in with entertainment centers instead of standing out with loud colors. The slim design fits under most wall-mounted TVs without blocking the screen or looking out of place. It also works well on a tabletop with built-in feet.</p>
<p>At $879, the lowest price ever for Black Friday, Sonos’s flagship soundbar with real 9.1.4 Dolby Atmos, Sound Motion technology, and AI-powered dialogue enhancement is hundreds of dollars cheaper than when it first came out, and it sounds better than any other budget option. The combination of spatial audio, room calibration, an expandable ecosystem, and music streaming at 20% off retail price makes this a great deal. This deal makes Sonos engineering available at prices that have never been seen before, so you can get home theater audio that justifies its high price through actual performance instead of just specs.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[LG 48″ OLED evo C4 Series Gets “Hidden Price” on Amazon, 45% Off Price Violates LG’s Display Rules]]></title>
            <link>https://kotaku.com/lg-48-oled-evo-c4-series-gets-hidden-price-on-amazon-45-off-price-violates-lgs-display-rules-2000648469</link>
            <guid>1367797</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>LG is the leader in the OLED TV market because of decades of experience with display panels that competitors can’t match. They stay on top even though Samsung, Sony, and Chinese manufacturers are always trying to take them down. Every year, the company comes out with new generations of TVs but some models become bestsellers that last longer than the yearly refresh cycles because they offer great value by balancing performance and price.</p>
<p>Right now, a 48-inch OLED C4 TV is currently on sale <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6064/">for $876 on Amazon on Black Friday, and it is a 45% drop from its original price of $1,599</a> which makes flagship OLED technology available at mid-tier LED prices. The pricing proves so aggressive that Amazon displays it as <em>“hidden price”</em> requiring cart addition before revealing the actual cost. Amazon explains this policy through manufacturer agreements: “<em>Because our price on this item is lower than the manufacturer’s suggested retail price, the manufacturer does not allow us to show you our price until you place the item in your shopping cart.”</em></p>

<h2>OLED pixels that light themselves up to make perfect blacks</h2>
<p>The main benefit of OLED is that the self-emissive pixels can turn completely off to make true blacks: This gives <strong>OLED TVs infinite contrast that LED TVs with backlights bleeding through LCD panels can’t match</strong>. LED TVs with local dimming come close to this with backlight zones but blooming and haloing around bright objects on dark backgrounds show the compromise that OLED gets rid of completely with per-pixel control.</p>



<p>The <strong>Gen7 α9 AI processor looks at each frame of content to improve picture quality</strong> by recognizing scenes, reducing noise and upscaling lower-resolution content to near-4K quality. Firmware updates keep the processor learning and getting better which means that picture quality will always be better than what the hardware can do at the time of purchase.</p>
<p>With <strong>VRR and HDMI 2.1 on all four ports and a 120Hz refresh rate</strong>, the PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X consoles can take full advantage of next-gen features and perform at their best. The near-instantaneous response time stops ghosting during fast motion, the high refresh rate lets you play competitive games at 120 frames per second, and variable refresh rate synchronization stops screen tearing that breaks immersion.</p>



<p><strong>Dolby Vision IQ automatically changes the brightness of HDR</strong> based on the amount of light in the room which is measured by built-in sensors. This keeps the picture quality at its best no matter what time of day or how bright it is. Different tone mapping is used for bright daytime viewing and dark evening viewing and makes sure that content looks the way it was meant to, not washed out by sunlight or too dim in the dark.<strong> Dolby Atmos audio processing makes three-dimensional soundscapes</strong> through the TV’s built-in speakers which act like overhead and surround channels.</p>
<p>The <strong>webOS smart platform</strong> makes it easy to navigate through thousands of streaming services such as Netflix, Disney+, HBO Max, Prime Video, and more, all from one interface that doesn’t lag. Using the <em>Magic Remote</em> with pointer control is like using a mouse instead of having to deal with directional buttons that make typing hard. You can use voice commands to search for content, control your smart home, and ask questions through the built-in Google Assistant and Alexa.</p>
<p>The record-low Black Friday pricing at $876 versus $1,599 launch makes LG’s OLED technology cost approach premium LED TVs delivering fraction of the picture quality through inferior backlight-based contrast. If you want OLED picture quality without waiting years for depreciation or accepting smaller sizes, this hidden price deal makes flagship display technology accessible at unprecedented Black Friday costs.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Black Friday is a great time to stock up on essentials, plus treat yourself to purchases that are a little hard to justify during the rest of the year. We’re spotting hundreds of discounts across almost every single category you could think of, including games. Titles have dropped in prices, and so have the consoles.</p>
<p>If you’re looking to surprise your little ones with something that gets them moving in your living room, we might have just found the best gaming deal of the season. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6060/">Nex Playground — a cube-like console — is currently sitting at $199 on Amazon, after a 20% discount on its close to $250 price tag</a>. You’ll also get $25 back in Amazon credit with your purchase, which brings the total down even further. Note that both discounts are only valid till supplies last, and that might not be long. To avoid any last-minute disappointments, it’s best to get your orders in fast.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6060/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Interactive Motion Games</h2>
<p>Nex Playground looks quite like a mini projector, but in a fun way. It connects to your TV and lets you play interactive motion games using just your body. There are no controllers needed, as the built-in wide-angle camera uses AI to scan your movements to register them in games on its own.</p>
<p>Multiplayer setup is supported. Up to four people can hop in at the same time to get some workout in. Five games are packed for free, including Fruit Ninja, Starri, Whac-a-Mole, Go Keeper, and Party Fowl; showcase your chopping skills with the fast movement of arms, or put that adrenaline to good use by nailing down as many moles as you can.

It encourages kids to move around, and is perfect for playdates or family game nights. Honestly, we won’t judge if you want to get a solo session in after putting the little ones to sleep. It’s also appropriate for kids of all ages, since it doesn’t support ads or in-app purchases. They can play their favorite games without needing you around!</p>



<p>Getting started couldn’t be simpler. Nex Playground connects to your TV using a single HDMI cable. Plug the power supply cord into the console and then plug the adapter into an outlet. Switch the thing on, and manage it using your TV remote; simple as that.</p>

Your living room is going to turn into a mini playground (or a battlefield) without a console or tons of other accessories. Just connect it to your TV, and get the party started.

Additionally, you can get $25 back in Amazon credit, which brings the price down even further.</a> Just note that the promotional credit is added automatically to your account 30 days after shipment, so you might not be able to access it right away.</p>
