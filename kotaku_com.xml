              <p>Our lives are dominated by long cables and fat adapters, invading our spaces creating unwanted clutter. Just about everything has a battery in it these days and requires daily charging. Your phone? Gotta plug it in. Your headphones? They used to just work, but now they’re Bluetooth so plug it in. Your watch? My old watch that just told time didn’t need it’s battery replaced for years. Now my Apple Watch needs to sit back in it’s wireless charger before I go to bed every night. Too many things need charging which means our desktops and nightstands are a tangled nightmare. Thankfully, that clutter can be reduced with a solid charging station. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4161/">Baseus has a 10-in-1 desktop charger that right now is marked down 40%. Normally priced at $50, that $20 savings means you only have to pay $30 for a limited time.</a></p>
<p>This power strip combines 10 different ports all together, meaning you can charge up to 10 devices at once. You get a mix of six AC outlets, three USB-C ports, and one USB-A port. With a wide range of compatibility, you won’t have to use different charging blocks all assembled together. Just plug your devices cables directly to whichever port works. In case you do still need to use one on account of having to charge several USB devices, the power station itself is designed to allow for easy access to the AC outlets. With each facing a different direction, you won’t end up dealing with losing more than one outlet due to an extra chunky adapter.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4161/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<p>Baseus’ power station is designed for a a cleaner workspace. It actually comes with an adhesive strip intended for the underside of the unit. You can keep the power station firmly in place on your desk or nightstand.</p>

<p>With all these devices charging simultaneously, you may be worried about risk of overheating. Well, the Baseus power stirp utilizes GaN6 technology for safer, cooler charging. It’s been engineered for efficient heat dissipation soi you stuff can charge fast without getting hot.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4161/">Right now, Amazon has the Baseus 10-in-1 charging station for a reduced price of just $30</a>. That’s a 40% discount down from it’s base price of $50. You’ll save a whole $20 for a limited time.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Good morning. It’s Friday Eve, also known as Thursday. The weekend is almost here. I can feel it in my bones. While we wait, here’s today’s Morning Checkpoint, <em>Kotaku</em>‘s daily round-up of video game news and other stuff you might care about. Today we have news about a Treyarch co-founder, a leaked <em>Yakuza</em> remake appears, Nvidia is making a big investment, and more <em>KPop Demon Hunters</em> is on the way in the near future.</p> <h2>Treyarch Co-Founder Peter Tripp Akemann Sentenced To Prison And House Arrest</h2> <p>In January, Peter Tripp Akemann flew a drone into a large firefighting aircraft that was helping to stop the horrible Palisades fire in the area around Los Angeles. The damage took the aircraft out of commission for a period of time. <a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/treyarch-co-founder-pleads-guilty-to-piloting-drone-during-la-fires">In February, Akemann pleaded guilty</a> to the crime. <a href="https://spectrumnews1.com/ca/southern-california/public-safety/2025/09/15/culver-city-man-sentencing-crashed-drone-into-super-scooper">And on Monday, Akemann was sentenced</a> by U.S. District Judge Michael W. Fitzgerald to serve 14 days in federal prison, followed by 30 days of home arrest. Akemann, who helped create the studio that is now part of Activision’s massive <em>Call of Duty</em> machine, will also have to pay around $156,000 in various fines.</p> <p>As part of a previous plea agreement, Akemann will also complete 150 hours of community service. His lawyers shared a message from the Treyarch co-founder earlier this year stating he was “deeply sorry” about damaging the aircraft and that he “accepts responsibility for his grave error in judgment, and is cooperating with the government in effort to make amends.”</p>

 <h2><em>Yakuza 3</em> Remake Accidentally Leaks Online</h2> <p>It looks like<em> Yakuza 3,</em> originally released in 2009 for the PlayStation 3, is getting a big ol’ remake. That’s according to a leak fans spotted earlier this week on the <em>Yakuza</em> developer’s very own website. <a href="https://www.engadget.com/rgg-accidentally-leaked-that-its-working-on-yakuza-kiwami-3-211036458.html">As reported by <em>Engadget</em></a>, Ryu Ga Gotoku Studios briefly listed<em> Yakuza Kiwami 3</em> alongside two previously released remakes, <em>Yakuza Kiwami</em> and <em>Yakuza Kiwami 2.</em> However,<em> Kiwami 3</em> has yet to be officially announced. Oops!</p> <p>The listing has since been scrubbed from the site, but not before fans could document it via screenshots and social media posts. Many expect this new remake to be announced at the upcoming Tokyo Game Show later this month.</p>

 <h2><em>Microsoft Flight Sim 2024</em> Reportedly The Next Xbox Game Leaping To PS5</h2> <p>If you thought Xbox was done bringing more games to PlayStation 5, well, then you probably haven’t been paying attention to the company’s activity over the last year or so. Anyway, Xbox is, <a href="https://www.ppe.pl/news/383315/wiemy-jaki-kolejny-ex-microsoftu-trafi-na-ps5-co-z-pudelkami-oblivion-remastered.html">according to a new report from Polish news site <em>PPE</em>,</a> porting <em>Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024</em> to the PS5. It’s claimed that this new port will be arriving in November of this year and will get a limited physical release. Xbox has yet to confirm, but this seems pretty likely to happen, and I expect an announcement soon.</p> <h2>Nvidia Investing $5 Billion Into Struggling Intel As Part Of Larger Partnership</h2> <p>Well, here’s something unexpected. Nvidia, one of the richest companies on the planet, is partnering with Intel, which has been struggling in recent years, <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/nvidia-bets-big-intel-with-5-billion-stake-chip-partnership-2025-09-18/">as part of a large deal that involves the GPU giant investing $5 billion</a>. The two companies issued a joint press release confirming the news and announced plans to work together to create “Intel x86 RTX SOCs” that will likely be used in devices like handheld PCs, laptops, and other portable electronics.</p> <p>As you might expect, this deal also includes a lot of talk about how this will help boost AI performance and move the technology forward. With this investment, Nvidia is now one of Intel’s largest shareholders. <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/china/trump-holds-high-stakes-meeting-with-intel-ceo-after-calling-his-resignation-2025-08-11/">Weirdly, the U.S. government is an even bigger shareholder</a> after a wild deal was struck last month, giving the United States 10 percent ownership of the chip maker.</p> <h2>ICYMI:</h2> <ul> <li><a href="https://kotaku.com/henry-halfhead-review-cozy-sandbox-sim-switch-2000626517"><em>Henry Halfhead</em> is a short game worth playing</a></li> <li><a href="https://kotaku.com/xbox-handheld-james-channel-halo-dangerous-steel-battalion-modder-2000626530">The most dangerous Xbox has been created</a></li> <li><a href="https://kotaku.com/kpop-demon-hunters-debut-short-film-rating-netflix-2000626490"><em>KPop Demon Hunters</em> is getting a new short film soon</a></li> </ul> <h2>Watch This:</h2>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/hades-2-sale-disccount-cheap-switch-2-2000626832</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><em>Hades 2</em> has its long-awaited 1.0 release later this month, but if you haven’t played the first game yet, you should really start warming up with that first. Supergiant Games’ <a href="https://kotaku.com/hades-the-kotaku-review-1845204803">2020 GOTY contender</a> is currently on sale to celebrate its five-year anniversary. You can grab <em>Hades 1</em> for less than most meals on the McDonald’s menu. Your heart will be better off, too.</p> <p>The action-RPG roguelike is about the son of Hades trying to escape the underworld and reach Mount Olympus. Players have to choose between competing upgrades and survive isometric bullet-hell battles to do so. A range of weapons and buildcrafting options, combined with incredible art and rich worldbuilding, make it an all-around exceptional game. Part classic arcade beat ’em up, part engrossing visual novel, <em>Hades</em> has something for everyone. Maybe that’s why it inspired Supergiant to make its first sequel.</p> <p><em>Hades</em> is normally $25, but right now it’s 75 percent off until September 30 on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1145360/Hades/">both Steam</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/store/products/hades-switch/?srsltid=AfmBOorNEZO4qZlxH5rvIgBR45p8YVScR59SD9KL2Tl8FfcUrFXtCTbS">the Switch eShop</a>. At just $6.24, it’s a steal. If you don’t already own it on Switch 2, now’s the time.</p>

 <p>Now I know what you’re thinking. Why buy<em> Hades 1</em> when <em>Hades 2</em> is just around the corner? <a href="https://kotaku.com/hades-2-release-date-1-0-patch-switch-2-pc-early-access-2000625272">The sequel launches September 25</a> after years in Early Access and is, on the surface at least, simply more <em>Hades</em>. But it tells a completely different story, stars a hero that’s more ranged-centric than the first game’s Zagreus, and is <a href="https://kotaku.com/hades-2-early-access-review-1851496575">definitely harder overall</a>.</p> <p>Is this a <em>Hollow Knight: Silksong</em> situation? Based on my time with the Early Access version I’m not ready to say, but new players will definitely benefit from warming up in the first game and getting a feel for the flow and decision-making that comes with selecting between all of the different upgrade paths. And hell, by the time you actually finish <em>Hades 1</em>, maybe the second game will be on sale for $6.29 too.</p>

              <p>It’s been a fittingly chaotic launch week for <em>Borderlands 4</em>. The cacophony of player feedback ranges from praise for the best new entry in the loot shooter series since <em>Borderlands 2</em> to very loud and <a href="https://kotaku.com/borderlands-4-pc-performance-dlss-frame-gen-pitchford-gearbox-steam-2000625765">angry complaints about bugs, crashes, and performance stutters on PC</a>. Even the PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X/S versions have some weird issues. Gearbox Entertainment now says a second patch to address PC performance is on the way as it also <a href="https://kotaku.com/borderlands-4-performance-fps-drops-stutter-ps5-pro-xbox-console-restart-gearbox-2000626487">investigates problems on console</a>.</p> <p>Not one to <a href="https://kotaku.com/borderlands-4-randy-pitchford-gearbox-80-real-fan-post-1851782855">calmly monitor feedback</a> from atop his 2K Games-funded Ivory Tower, studio CEO Randy Pitchford has been arguing almost nonstop with fans since the game released about whether their gripes about how it runs are legitimate or not. Wit<em>h Borderlands 4</em> sitting at at a mixed rating on Steam with just 65 percent positive reviews, the veteran poster has been handling criticism in classic <em>Borderlands</em> fashion.</p> <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">Randy is now doing personal tech support for Twitter users and recommending 4x frame gen for a 5080 and telling them to turn off fog which is literally not an option in the game <a href="https://t.co/WzRMiDO8Pt">pic.twitter.com/WzRMiDO8Pt</a></p> <p>— Paul Tassi (@PaulTassi) <a href="https://twitter.com/PaulTassi/status/1967928069991366700?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">September 16, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <p>Here’s an abridged recap of the post-launch Pitchford timeline:</p> <ul> <li>“<a href="https://x.com/DuvalMagic/status/1966953086448185650">Code your own engine and show us how it’s done, please.</a>” – September 13</li> <li>“<a href="https://x.com/DuvalMagic/status/1966958001216253985">Borderlands 4 is a premium game made for premium gamers.</a>” – September 13</li> <li>“<a href="https://x.com/DuvalMagic/status/1966952362293273013">If you’re not 4k stubborn and just want to have a great, fun time with higher perf, please consider running at 1440p resolution.</a>” – September 13</li> <li>“<a href="https://x.com/DuvalMagic/status/1967344224728400187">Fun facts: Customer Service reports for Borderlands 4 at roughly 1% or so of installs.</a>” – September 14</li> <li>“<a href="https://x.com/DuvalMagic/status/1967351908613665255">I have personally helped users go from 30FPS to 90FPS+</a>” – September 14</li> <li>“<a href="https://x.com/DuvalMagic/status/1967424826697781446">Every PC gamer must accept the reality of the relationship between their hardware and what the software they are running is doing.</a>” – September 14</li> <li>“<a href="https://x.com/DuvalMagic/status/1967424828975255865">The game is pretty damn optimal</a>” – September 14</li> <li>“<a href="https://x.com/DuvalMagic/status/1967829418275172510">Please get a refund from Steam if you aren’t happy with it.</a>”&nbsp;– September 14</li> <li>“<a href="https://x.com/PaulTassi/status/1967928069991366700">Would you like help tuning with your personal specification?</a>”&nbsp;– September 16</li> <li>“<a href="https://x.com/PaulTassi/status/1967928069991366700">Turn down or off the volumetric fog</a>”&nbsp;– September 16</li> <li>“<a href="https://x.com/DuvalMagic/status/1968388123534180815">Oops. You are correct: the bottom setting for fog is ‘low’ not “off</a>” – September 17</li> </ul> <p>Reactions to this approach have been mixed. “At what point do the crashouts stop making sense?” <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Borderlands/comments/1ni56df/randy_pitchford_code_your_own_engine_and_show_us/">asked</a> one player. Another claiming to be a game industry veteran who was definitely not Pitchford writing under an alias <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Borderlands/comments/1n4ljjl/in_which_i_a_game_industry_veteran_give_sincere/">applauded</a>:” “Randy Pitchford cares. He manically, catastrophically, awkwardly, SINCERELY cares.” I would simply add that <a href="https://kotaku.com/borderlands-4-pax-west-rage-room-gearbox-2000621767">this drama is as much a part of <em>Borderlands</em></a> at this point as the bandit psycho masks, terrible Claptrap puns, and glowing ammo hidden in toilets.</p>

 <h2>A second patch to fix <em>Borderlands 4</em> on PC is on the way</h2> <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">Shroud's game crashed on Borderlands 4 and cost them all those legendaries RIP😅 <a href="https://t.co/we3m1onoZp">pic.twitter.com/we3m1onoZp</a></p> <p>— Jake Lucky (@JakeSucky) <a href="https://twitter.com/JakeSucky/status/1968064528052314348?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">September 16, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <p>To help set the record straight or at least cut through the noise a bit, Gearbox released <a href="https://x.com/Borderlands/status/1968451501803651131">an official statement</a> last night clarifying the team’s ongoing priorities as we approach <em>Borderlands 4</em>‘s one-week anniversary. Here are the priorities following an emergency update over the weekend to try to improve optimization on PC:</p> <blockquote> <ul> <li>We know some PC players are running into bugs and crashes. We hear you. Updates to improve stability and performance already started rolling out over the weekend and another is coming this Thursday. <strong>This is our top priority. </strong></li> <li>A Field of View [FOV] slider option for consoles is in testing right now and more information is coming very soon on that. Some console players have reported concerns with performance and we’re investigating those with planned updates coming.</li> </ul> </blockquote> <p>The studio also released additional Shift codes for gold keys, including a Break Free Pack, to sweeten the deal with more bonus loot. At least one research firm <a href="https://alineaanalytics.substack.com/p/borderlands-4-was-steams-best-selling?img=https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F23cbc54f-9348-46e1-a902-bc593d78c6d0_1920x1080.png&amp;open=false">has suggested</a> <em>Borderlands 4</em> has already sold over 2 million copies in its first couple of&nbsp; days. Official player stats from Gearbox indicate 764,733,586 total items looted and 4,563,416 deaths by grenade as well as a quarter of all attempted boss fights being failed. I’m sure at least some of them will blame it on not being able to play <em>Borderlands 4</em> at 120fps in 4K.</p>
