              <p>Almost five years after <em>Final Fantasy VII Remake Intergrade</em> brought the game to PlayStation 5, that version of the game is getting a free new update that will add a new “streamlined” mode to the game for people who just want to enjoy the story. This patch will arrive on January 22, just in time for the RPG’s launch on <a href="https://kotaku.com/ff7-switch-2-remake-framerate-final-fantasy-2000622094">Switch 2 and Xbox Series X/S</a>.</p> <p>“To celebrate <em>Final Fantasy VII Remake Intergrade</em> launch day on Nintendo Switch 2 &amp; Xbox, a patch for the PS5 and PC versions will launch next Thursday,” Square Enix announced on January 15. “This introduces Streamlined Progression, including the ability to keep HP and MP topped up, and always hit for 9,999 damage!” Now every attack can be an Omnislash and you won’t even have to spend over 500 hours <a href="https://kotaku.com/final-fantasy-vii-player-hits-level-99-in-the-first-rea-1794171766">grinding at the first reactor to make it happen</a>.</p>

 <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">To celebrate Final Fantasy VII Remake Intergrade launch day on Nintendo Switch 2 &amp; Xbox, a patch for the PS5 and PC versions will launch next Thursday.</p> <p>This introduces Streamlined Progression, including the ability to keep HP and MP topped up, and always hit for 9,999 damage! <a href="https://t.co/XMuEdhreTP">pic.twitter.com/XMuEdhreTP</a></p> <p>— FINAL FANTASY VII (@finalfantasyvii) <a href="https://twitter.com/finalfantasyvii/status/2011740264772305213?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 15, 2026</a></p></blockquote>  <p>The previously teased Streamlined Progression mode is effectively a story mode for people who want to follow Cloud and his Avalanche pals in their journey through Midgar to topple Shinra without having to deal with all of the difficulty that might come from combat, and especially certain boss encounters. Instead of toggling the game to easy, players can make it so their characters are already maxed out and hitting for the most damage possible.</p>

 <p>While included at launch in the new ports, the patch will let existing players on PC and PS5 play around with the mode as well. Could it be an easy way to clear the game on hard for the Platinum trophy? Maybe! And for newcomers it’s worth noting that anyone who buys the game digitally before the end of the month will automatically get the digital version of the original <em>Final Fantasy VII</em> along with it.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><span>Because </span><a href="https://bsky.app/profile/veryimportant.lawyer/post/3lybxlwzjuc2h"><span>everyone on the internet is 12 years old</span></a><span>, the current American administration is posting through its fascist agenda with memes. Trump’s White House has previously used </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-responds-to-dhs-video-using-the-original-animes-theme-2000628222"><i><span>Pokemon</span></i></a><span>, </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/department-homeland-security-halo-ice-pokemon-video-dhs-2000639308"><i><span>Halo</span></i></a><span>, and even pop star </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/sabrina-carpenter-ice-video-juno-song-response-trump-2000649672"><span>Sabrina Carpenter’s music</span></a><span> to try to recruit people for ICE. Now, it’s using an AI mockup of beloved farming sim </span><i><span>Stardew Valley </span></i><span>to promote the return of whole milk to school lunches.</span></p> <p><span>On January 14, Trump signed a law that will </span><a href="https://apnews.com/article/whole-milk-school-lunches-trump-5572176286b322d844bb76d52906e2c7"><span>return whole milk to school lunches</span></a><span>, This is overturning an Obama-era restriction on higher-fat milk options. Alright, whatever. On a list of things Trump has done in his years in office, that’s hardly the worst. But now, the White House has used this as another opportunity to use a video game’s imagery.</span></p>

 <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">Whole milk is back. 🥛 <a href="https://t.co/kHf51s5qwX">pic.twitter.com/kHf51s5qwX</a></p> <p>— The White House (@WhiteHouse) <a href="https://twitter.com/WhiteHouse/status/2011864079053238516?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 15, 2026</a></p></blockquote>  <p><span>At a glance, it might not look like much. The AI-generated image hast an ugly faux-pixel-art sprite of Trump looking like he got hit in the face with a frying pan, his inventory has a bunch of the things you’d expect like a MAGA hat and a cop badge, and he’s shown saying, “We’re bringing back Whole Milk and Making America Healthy Again.” But also, if you look at the gold he’s carrying in the screenshot, the number is 45464748.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><span>Trump is the 45th and 47th president of the United States, and has held onto the debunked claims that he won the presidency against Joe Biden in 2020. He has also publicly said he’s </span><a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/donald-trump/trump-third-term-white-house-methods-rcna198752"><span>open to a third term</span></a><span>, which would be in </span><a href="https://constitutioncenter.org/the-constitution/amendments/amendment-xxii"><span>violation of the 22nd amendment</span></a><span>, but Trump doesn’t seem to think the law applies to him. Steve Bannon, the ex-chief-strategist of the Trump administration, has also said that Trump </span><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/24/us/politics/president-trump-2028-steve-bannon.html"><span>will have a third term</span></a><span>, while also </span><a href="https://www.axios.com/2026/01/10/steve-bannon-2028-campaign-maga"><span>reportedly planning to run himself</span></a><span>. So these numbers seem to be a thinly veiled threat that Trump wants to be president again in 2028.</span></p>

 <p><span>We’ve reached out to </span><i><span>Stardew Valley </span></i><span>developer Concerned Ape for comment on this story and will update it if we hear back.</span></p>

            <title><![CDATA[A Reality TV Show Is Going To Put Actual People Inside A Fallout Vault]]></title>
            <link>https://kotaku.com/fallout-amazon-tv-show-reality-vault-shelter-2000660254</link>
            <guid>1407559</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Amazon’s live-action <em>Fallout</em> show, <a href="https://kotaku.com/fallout-tv-series-season-two-reviews-prime-video-2000653876">which is currently in the middle of season two</a>, has been a big hit for the tech giant. Now it seems to be doubling down on the franchise with a <em>Fallout</em>-themed reality show, which is currently looking for contestants.</p> <p>While Amazon hasn’t yet put out a teaser trailer for any <a href="https://kotaku.com/best-fallout-games-3-4-5-76-bethesda-rpg-new-vegas-611408965/2"><em>Fallout</em></a> reality show, <a href="https://us.castitreach.com/ag/slus/fallout/welcome.html">it is starting to look for cast members via a casting website</a>, as spotted by <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/amazon-has-greenlit-a-fallout-reality-show-where-contestants-live-in-a-vault-for-a-huge-cash-prize/"><em>VGC</em></a>. The site has a big banner image that asks people if they have what it takes to “win a big cash prize.” The reality show, which currently has a working title of “Fallout Shelter,” will force a group of people to live together in a vault and will test their skills via different activities and competitions.</p>

 <p>Here’s how the site describes the show:</p> <blockquote><p>Fallout Shelter (working title) is a new reality competition series based on the hit Amazon drama and computer game of the same name. The dwellers (contestants) live together in a top-secret vault, where they will compete in a series of games that tests the seven core attributes from the Fallout world. Strength, perception, endurance, charisma, intelligence, agility and luck (S.P.E.C.I.A.L). The series will not only test dwellers’ core attributes, but also their loyalty and alliances. It’s a game of power dynamics, popularity and social strategy which will ultimately result in a huge cash prize, but do you have what it takes to be the most S.P.E.C.I.A.L.?</p></blockquote> <p>The site features a series of questions for folks who are interested in being a part of the reality show, including questions that ask people to rank how smart they are or how agile they might be on a scale of one to ten. So it sounds like contestants may provide Amazon and the producers with their own S.P.E.C.I.A.L. stats that could be referenced in the production.</p>

 <p>Honestly, this just sounds like Amazon trying to make a<em> Big Brother</em> knock-off, but using <em>Fallout</em> to lure in gamers who might not watch otherwise. As someone who enjoys some Survivor and <em>Big Brother</em> from time to time and who also likes <em>Fallout</em>, I’ll check this show out whenever it finally arrives. They should probably pick a different name, though, <a href="https://kotaku.com/i-cant-stop-playing-fallout-shelter-1711784648">as <em>Fallout Shelter</em> is already a thing</a>.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Microsoft Replaces Its Employee Library With AI ‘Learning Experiences’]]></title>
            <link>https://kotaku.com/microsoft-library-ai-copilot-errors-2000660247</link>
            <guid>1407517</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Last year, Microsoft committed over <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2025/jul/30/microsoft-q2-2025-earnings">$100 billion of new investment</a> toward AI. Part of that technological arms race has included training LLMs on <a href="https://fortune.com/2025/06/12/open-ai-microsoft-harvard-libraries-train-ai-models/">millions of books</a>, including some written 600 years ago. This year, Microsoft is paying back the favor by ditching its own employee library. <a href="https://www.theverge.com/tech/862531/microsoft-library-closure-transition-changes-notepad"><em>The Verge</em> reports</a> that the company is closing it down and slashing news subscriptions in favor of “AI-powered learning experiences.”</p> <p>The onsite collection of books was allegedly so heavy, <a href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/20200204-00/?p=103394">it once was blamed</a> for cracking the underground parking lot pillars that supported it. That library, now housed in building 92, will now be closed, according to <em>The Verge</em>. The company’s roughly 220,000 employees have also reportedly lost access to checking out digital copies of business books and accessing news publications like <em>The Information</em>.</p>

 <p>Instead of learning about the world through the considered words of other human beings, they will now be engaging with a “more modern, AI-powered learning experience through the Skilling Hub,” according to an FAQ sent to staff. “The Library closed as part of Microsoft’s move toward a more modern, connected learning experience through the Skilling Hub,” it reads. “We know this change affects a space many people valued.”</p>

 <p>Contrast that with what Microsoft recently said after it was revealed that UK police had <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/software/ai/uk-police-apologise-to-parliament-after-admitting-a-major-and-controversial-policy-decision-was-based-on-ai-making-stuff-up/">relied on an AI hallucination</a> when making the controversial decision to ban fans from a certain soccer match. “Copilot combines information from multiple web sources into a single response with linked citations,” a spokesperson for the company told media outlets. “It informs users they are interacting with an AI system and encourages them to review the sources.” Remember, it’s not slop, it’s a “<a href="https://kotaku.com/microsoft-ai-slop-satya-nadella-2000656473">bicycle for the mind</a>.”</p>

 <p>It’s unclear if Copilot will be the basis for these new “AI learning experiences” that employees are now being encouraged to utilize, or what other sources of information they will use to review them now that the library is shutting down. As the science fiction writer Ray Bradbury <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131103101724/http://community.seattletimes.nwsource.com/archive/?date=19930312&amp;slug=1689996">once told the <em>Seattle Times</em></a> in Microsoft’s own backyard, “You don’t have to burn books to destroy a culture. Just get people to stop reading them.”</p>

              <p>Anyone who has ever played&nbsp;<em>Minecraft</em> at any point in its 17 years of existence already has a head start when it comes to playing&nbsp;<em>Hytale</em>. The two games are so similar that familiarity with one mostly sets you up for the other. However, this also means it can be easier to get tripped up by the smaller details that <em>are</em> different, those aspects of the cuboid survival game that aren’t quite where you might expect them to be. So to prepare you for the transition, here are 10 things I wish I’d known before I started.</p> <hr> <h2>Don’t look for&nbsp;<em>Hytale</em> on Steam</h2> <p>In a bold move, developer Hypixel has chosen not to release <em>Hytale&nbsp;</em>on Steam, nor indeed Epic or GOG. The early access game is only available to buy <a href="https://hytale.com/">via the game’s own site</a>, and then only loads through the game’s own installed loader. Why? Because of the fall of man? Or perhaps to avoid paying the 30-percent tithes? I dunno, but it’s annoying to have yet another bespoke loader to clutter up your desktop. The game’s also not yet on console, although that’s planned for the future.</p>

 <hr> <h2>Before anything else, head for the Forgotten Temple Gateway</h2> <figure id="attachment_2000660212" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000660212"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000660212">© Hypixel / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p>The smartest thing to do at the start of a new game of <em>Hytale</em> is make your way to the Forgotten Temple Gateway. This is a magic portal under a ruined temple that will teleport you to the Forgotten Temple hub, a peaceful location in which you can register all the mobs you’ve encountered so far with a central statue. (As the game develops, it’ll also be the hub for a lot of new content.) Its location is marked on your compass at the top of the screen, and it should be pretty nearby. Every creature you meet for the first time, whether hostile or ambivalent, will send a blue spark called a Memory your way. The more of these you gather, the more unlocks you’ll get via the statue, gaining access to new craftable items on your workstations.</p>

 <hr> <h2>You get sticks from trees and bushes</h2> <p>I realize, out of context, that sounds like the stupidest piece of advice ever. “What next, John? You get bear shit from woods?” But the point here is in&nbsp;<em>Minecraft</em> sticks are crafted from wood blocks, and that’s&nbsp;<em>not</em> the case in&nbsp;<em>Hytale</em>. The ingredient, vital for crafting rudimentary tools, arrows and torches, instead falls when chopping down trees and whacking bushes. And they fall plentifully! However, given the speed with which crossbows go through arrows, you’re going to want stack after stack after stack of them, so get used to punching down every bush you walk past. And talking of which…</p>

 <hr> <h2>Trees are affected by gravity</h2> <p>“And Popes are affected by Catholicism?” Yes, cleverclogs, but if you’ve played&nbsp;<em>Minecraft</em> you’ll be familiar with the oddity that has blocks magically float in place if you remove those between them and the ground. Not so in <em>Hytale</em>, meaning chopping down trees for trunks, which are then crafted into wooden blocks, and then in turn into vast amounts of other items in the game, is a much faster affair. Chop down the very lowest bit of the trunk, and then rest of the tree will come cascading down around you in its various bits and blocks, complete with trunks, sticks, and the all-important sap which is used for crafting torches, candles and other lighting.</p>

 <hr> <h2>You’re going to need a BIG house for crafting tables</h2> <figure id="attachment_2000660213" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000660213"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000660213">© Hypixel / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p>When I built my first modest log cabin, it was with the expectation that I’d have a nice little crafting table, perhaps an anvil, and with enough room for some chests and eventually whatever&nbsp;<em>Hytale</em>‘s equivalent of an enchanting table might be. Oh, poor sweet summer child that I am. I have since added two entire new&nbsp;<em>wings</em> to my home to fit in the <a href="https://kotaku.com/hytale-minecraft-hypixel-crafting-workbench-quests-2000660135">ridiculous array of different workbenches</a> you need to play the game. There are a total of eight workbenches that you’ll absolutely&nbsp;<em>need</em>, and then a further four more you can add, and most have a footprint three blocks wide and two blocks high. Why it’s like this is anyone’s guess, but plan ahead when building your starter home.</p>

 <hr> <h2>Put chests directly next to workbenches</h2> <p>One of the neatest elements of&nbsp;<em>Hytale</em> (and it’s somewhat damning that it’s a detail this granular) is that if you store items in a chest near to a workbench, the bench will source materials from the chests while you’re crafting. In <em>Minecraft</em> you need to have everything in your on-body inventory, which requires juggling items between chests before crafting. Here, you can keep the crafting materials you need the most often in nearby storage and do far less organizational drudgery. Those chests do need to be close, though. If they’re on the other side of the room the bench won’t recognize them.</p>

 <hr> <h2>Repair Kits let you fix tools and weapons on the fly</h2> <p><em>Hytale</em> doesn’t offer&nbsp;<em>Minecraft</em>‘s means of fixing a weakened weapon or tool via anvils, but instead through a bespoke Repair Kit. This is a craftable item that you can keep in your inventory, and then use to restore most of a tool’s durability while you’re out and about. This is especially helpful if your pickaxe breaks when you’re 40 blocks below ground and have lost the route you took to get down there. They don’t come cheap, however. While all you need to craft a Repair Kit is two Linen Scraps, one Light Leather, and one Iron Ingot, these are all items that you’ll only get from hard work. Leather comes from slain mobs, which must then be processed on your (very slow) Tanning Rack. Linen Scraps come from fallen enemies’ clothing. And Iron Ingots are iron you’ve put through your Furnace, and at this point are a bizarrely difficult resource to find. See the next tip for more on that.</p> <hr> <h2>Iron is hard to come by</h2> <p>You might think, given&nbsp;<em>Hytale</em>‘s hierarchy of metals going Copper &gt; Iron &gt; Thorium &gt; Cobalt &gt; Adamantite &gt; Mithril, that iron would be reasonable simple to find. In&nbsp;<em>Minecraft</em>, it’s pretty much the second ore you’ll ever find after coal, and sits pretty near the surface. Not so in&nbsp;<em>Hytale</em>, where iron doesn’t start showing up until you’ve gone a&nbsp;<em>long</em> way underground, and then almost always in caverns packed with very tough enemies for such an early point in the game. I imagine this is something that will be balanced out in the near future, but for now know that you want to dig until you’re seeing lava, and then spot the silver glints in the ceiling and walls in areas that aren’t packed with foes. Grab as much as you can and get out fast.</p> <hr> <h2>You don’t drop&nbsp;<em>everything</em> when you die</h2> <figure id="attachment_2000660217" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000660217"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000660217">© Hypixel / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p>In another tweak to the&nbsp;<em>Minecraft&nbsp;</em>formula, <em>Hytale</em> doesn’t strip your entire inventory when you die and respawn. Instead you keep about two-thirds of what you had when you conked it, which is pretty generous in comparison. (Only cowards play&nbsp;<em>Minecraft</em> with “Keep Inventory” toggled on.) The rest will drop where you died, and the game will put a death marker on the compass to direct you back there to scoop it all back up.</p>

 <hr> <h2>You can build teleporters to speed up travel</h2> <p>I wish this were possible a lot earlier, given the ordeal it is to craft. <em>Hytale</em>‘s world of Orbis is enormous, and while movement is pretty swift, if you’ve been out exploring other biomes it’ll still take you a fair amount of time to return to your current home without taking the death route. But there’s a way to make Teleporters, and leave as many as six of them in the world. (That number can reach 12 if you unlock enough Memories in the Forgotten Temple.)</p> <p>The first thing you need to do is upgrade your main workbench to level 2. That requires 20 Iron, which as mentioned above is the biggest obstacle, alongside 30 Copper (easily found everywhere) and 20 Linen Scrap (kill a bunch of humanoid enemies). That done, you can then craft the Arcanist’s Workbench, but this in turn is a hefty challenge. For this you’ll need 20 Essence of the Void (kill monsters at night for these), 30 Linen Scraps, and toughest of all, 10 Thorium Ingots. This requires you to travel to the Howling Sands biome (in what’s called Zone 2), so it’s not something you’ll be doing straight away.</p>

 <p>With&nbsp;<em>that</em> done, you then need the Teleporter ingredients too! For this you need Azure Logs, Azure Kelp and some regular stone. For that you need to find the blue Azure Forest biome and chop down some of those blue, blue trees.</p> <p>So yeah, quite the fuss. But once done, you’ve got a way to leap around Orbis like a mad wizard.</p>
