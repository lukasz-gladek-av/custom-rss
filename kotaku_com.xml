This wasn’t a member of the pop-rock band being involved in some extramarital affairs; it was the band accidentally exposing an allegedly cheating couple at its July 15 Foxborough concert by <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.vice.com/en/article/the-internet-cant-stop-laughing-at-the-cheating-couple-from-the-coldplay-concert/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/the-internet-cant-stop-laughing-at-the-cheating-couple-from-the-coldplay-concert/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">projecting them onto a Jumbotron</a></span> while they were embracing, leading to the two quickly looking away from the camera. Coldplay frontman Chris Martin remarked that the couple was either “having an affair or they’re just very shy,” but the internet did what it does best and found out who they were, and the entire thing has played out very publicly and invasively. And now that the footage has been seen by millions, it’s being parodied at sporting events that have a kiss cam.</p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="197589" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="Ring Psychology: Understanding The 6 Phases Of A Wrestling Match Through Heel Era John Cena" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="659" data-playlist="197589,197586,197585" data-current="197589"><div><p>Ring Psychology: Understanding The 6 Phases Of A Wrestling Match Through Heel Era John Cena</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197589/197589_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197589/197589_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197589/197589_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/23110.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>Footage from several sporting events has been showing up online in the days since the Coldplay show, with some venues rebranding their kiss cam as the “Coldplay Cam.” Normally, these crowd shots displayed on a huge screen give couples a chance to express their love for one another for all to see. Sometimes, there are awkward misunderstandings where the folks behind the camera capture siblings or friends, and they have to flail about so everyone knows they’re not a couple. But right now, all anyone seems to want to do is run away from the camera to reference the now-infamous scene. Some venues are even encouraging it, searching for couples who are embracing the same way the caught couple was at Coldplay’s show. One of the funnier examples was when the Phillie Phanatics’ mascots unexpectedly re-enacted the whole thing shot for shot.</p><p>The whole situation has split the internet. Some think it’s fine to clown on rich people being caught doing things they’d rather keep under wraps, others say it’s <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.404media.co/the-astronomer-ceos-coldplay-concert-fiasco-is-emblematic-of-our-social-media-surveillance-dystopia/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.404media.co/the-astronomer-ceos-coldplay-concert-fiasco-is-emblematic-of-our-social-media-surveillance-dystopia/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">kinda fucked up, and has negative ramifications for all of us</a></span>, that a personal matter is playing out so publicly.

Footage of the band’s Madison concert on Saturday, July 19, shows Martin’s preamble being met with knowing laughs from the audience and the singer. </p></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://kotaku.com/coldplay-cheating-scandal-kiss-cam-mascot-skit-memes-1851786655]]></content:encoded>

That’s when Ubisoft says a new free update will add a new game plus option and third-person mode to the first-person <em>Far Cry</em>-like game. </p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="196470" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="The Week In Games: Reignited Rivalries And More New Releases" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="123" data-playlist="196470,196299,195922" data-current="196470"><div><p>The Week In Games: Reignited Rivalries And More New Releases</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196470/196470_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196470/196470_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196470/196470_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196470/196470_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/22020.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>“Third Person Mode, New Game+, and more” will arrive on December 5, the publisher announced on Monday. That follows several other updates that brought improved AI, UI, and quality-of-life fixes to the game, including a revamped hunter’s guide to make the open-world game’s grind less cumbersome. The result is one of the best-looking next-gen games ever, with some pretty cool moments buried in-between the familiar Ubisoft game design bloat. </p><p><em>Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora </em>also has an enhanced mode for PS5 Pro and is regularly on sale for dirt cheap. The Deluxe Edition is currently just $24 on PSN (it’s normally $80) and BJ’s is currently selling the Xbox version for just $10. Suffice it to say, it’s routinely in that sweet spot of “worth checking out for the price,” especially if you’re a <em>Far Cry</em> fan who likes hunting and taking out enemy forts using a combination of stealth and pure chaos. </p><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/far-cry-7-assassins-creed-hexe-ghost-recon-delay-1851780674&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/far-cry-7-assassins-creed-hexe-ghost-recon-delay-1851780674">A new <em>Far Cry</em></a></span><em> i</em>s likely still a year or more away, with Ubisoft recently confirming that some of its biggest in-development blockbusters would be delayed to get the time they needed.
