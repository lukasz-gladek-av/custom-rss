            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Obsidian’s gorgeous fantasy RPG <em>Avowed</em> just got a new patch, promising the usual list of bug fixes and some new features. The game is also now “Verified” for Steam Deck. What’s it like in a portable form factor? Well, it certainly boots up. It’s certainly <em>playable</em>, hitting a semi-decent 30 FPS that doesn’t necessarily feel <em>that</em> terrible to play. How it looks on Valve’s handheld PC, however, is another story. Have a seat, let’s talk about it. </p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="196055" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="6 Things To Know Before Starting Persona 5 Tactica" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="227" data-playlist="196055,196447,196663" data-current="196055"><div><p>6 Things To Know Before Starting Persona 5 Tactica</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196055/196055_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196055/196055_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196055/196055_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196055/196055_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/21584.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>Set in an imaginative world with all the trappings of lush forests and pretty, sparkly magical effects, <em>Avowed</em> may not be aiming to be the most graphically impressive title out there, but it sure is a looker.

Sure, the statue is impressively in focus and clear, but I think this overall image takes away from the game’s ability to immerse you visually. It’s not how I’d recommend one experience <em>Avowed</em> unless this was your only possible option.</p><p>Have another look at the game on the same Deck: </p><figure id="" data-id="deb5d5578fb28263938cdd26b44334ee" data-recommend-id="image://deb5d5578fb28263938cdd26b44334ee" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="800" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The protagonist throws a Frost bomb at an enemy." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="The protagonist throws a Frost bomb at an enemy." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Obsidian / Claire Jackson / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="deb5d5578fb28263938cdd26b44334ee" data-recommend-id="image://deb5d5578fb28263938cdd26b44334ee" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="800" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The protagonist throws a Frost bomb at an enemy." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>And here’s how combat looks: </p><p>We can go into the details. Distant objects look really messy, splotchy, shimmery, and sometimes pixel-art adjacent—in fact, it sorta reminds me of <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://youtu.be/bVw1Mpb0QFo&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://youtu.be/bVw1Mpb0QFo" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">playing that <em>Oblivion</em> quest</a></span> where you’re stuck in a painting. It hovers at a 30-40 FPS status, which isn’t too bad, but the odd visuals, I think, actually make me play worse (I’m also used to playing this game on mouse and keyboard, not the gamepad layout of the Steam Deck, to be clear).</p><p>Yes, it will sorta settle down at times when rendering and FSR3 catch up, but it’s still not great. And the second you move, distant options look all crunchy and shitty again.</p><h2 id="h685274"><a id=""></a>What about the new class options and other features?</h2><p>I’ve been playing on the hardest difficulty in <em>Avowed</em> with a ranger-ish build that primarily uses rifles. Surprisingly, it feels like playing a first-person shooter more than something like <em>Fallout 4</em> did. My brain is sorta in <em>Doom</em> mode when I’m playing. While the game put up a tough fight early on, I eventually reached a certain level of power where I was annihilating everything. I’m also doing every quest and finding everything on every map, so my character has a lot of experience invested in her stats.</p><p>The fighter and ranger got new active and passive abilities. And the update refunded everyone’s skill points, so you can already get to trying out new builds. From the looks of things, this is only going to make me more unstoppable than I already am. The “Sharpshooter” ranger passive looks like it will make my pretty sweet rifle even deadlier. That said, abilities like “Shadow Step,” a previously NPC-exclusive ability that lets you vanish and appear behind your target, feel a little redundant since I can already go invisible. </p><p>I’m going to need to mix and match these new abilities for a while to judge just how transformative they are for a game I didn’t find that challenging anyway. So maybe I’m not the best judge of how helpful the new build options are. I’ll get back to you if something really blows my mind. You can read all the nitty gritty details of the patch, which <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://forums.obsidian.net/topic/134877-patch-15-notes/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://forums.obsidian.net/topic/134877-patch-15-notes/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">includes some new weapons and attire, here.</a></span></p><p>Anyway, <em>Avowed</em> rocks. It’s a serious contender for GOTY in my book—just don’t play it running natively on Steam Deck if you can help it. Stick to streaming if you want to kick back on the couch. </p><p><strong>Read More:</strong>&nbsp;<span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/steam-deck-2024-big-games-unplayable-space-marine-2-pc-1851669933&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/steam-deck-2024-big-games-unplayable-space-marine-2-pc-1851669933">Many Of 2024's Biggest Games Don’t Play Well (Or At All) On Steam Deck</a></span></p><p><br>And Valve, we’re really gonna need to have a talk about this “<span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/steam-deck-2024-big-games-unplayable-space-marine-2-pc-1851669933&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/steam-deck-2024-big-games-unplayable-space-marine-2-pc-1851669933">Playable”/”Verified” dynamic</a></span> on Steam Deck.

Next year’s <em>Hoppers</em> has just released its first trailer, and it shows what looks like a delightful talk-to-the-animals movie. But will it be enough to rescue the studio after <em>Elio</em>’s box office bombing?</p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="196406" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="Why This Under-the-Radar AAA Title Is More Than Just A Far Cry Clone" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="102" data-playlist="196406,197586,197589" data-current="196406"><div><p>Why This Under-the-Radar AAA Title Is More Than Just A Far Cry Clone</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196406/196406_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196406/196406_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196406/196406_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196406/196406_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/21954.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>I hope so! And from this first lighthearted teaser trailer (although, given this plays out like a regular trailer, I don’t think the word “teaser” has any meaning left at all), it sure looks like it deserves success. Pixar certainly thrives when it comes to meatier discourse, exploring complex emotions and relationships, but it’s hard to argue against the studio aiming for a more broad comedy.</p><p>The premise—a group of scientists create a device that allows a human mind to inhabit a mechanical animal so as to blend in and learn about their culture—is so blatantly lifted from <em>Avatar</em> that the opening of the teaser just flat-out acknowledges it. However, subject Mabel Tanaka gets into the body of a beaver and then refuses to leave, in order to help the local creatures battle an evil construction company set to destroy the local habitat.</p><p>The two-minute trailer shows lots of fun observation humor about animal life, based on Mabel’s sudden ability to understand what the other creatures are saying. It’s the sort of goofball territory I feel Pixar hasn’t reveled in since the days of <em>A Bug’s Life</em>, and I’m very happy to see it happening. However, I’m also pretty aware that this is perhaps considered Dreamworks’ territory—the rival animation house dominates the field with its <em>Madagascar</em> and <em>Kung Fu Panda</em> franchises, and even the brief life of <em>Over the Hedge</em>. It’ll be interesting to see how that works out.</p><p><em>Hoppers</em> isn’t quite Pixars last chance—Enrico Casarosa’s (<em>Luca</em>) next animated feature <em>Gatto</em> is due for early summer 2027, featuring a black cat called Nero who befriends a Venetian graffiti artist while attempting to escape from the feline mob. That’s <em>quite</em> the pitch. <em>Luca</em>, sent straight to Disney+ during the pandemic, became a sleeper hit with a massive fanbase, so if Disney can figure out how to market <em>Gatto</em> to that audience—i.e. market it as if it were a sequel—it could fly.</p><p>Otherwise, it <em>is</em> just sequels. Pixar’s upcoming roster for the next few years includes <em>Toy Story 5</em>, <em>Incredibles 3</em>, and <em>Coco 2</em>, with <em>Inside Out 3</em> all but inevitable. But the reality is, their top-grossing movies all have at least a “2” in the title, with no original property ever hitting the all-important $1bn box office. However, the wise person might want to point out you cannot ever have any of those billion dollar sequels if you don’t have the first movie first! Hopefully someone at Disney can recognize this—even if <em>Hoppers</em> isn’t the all-consuming megahit they way, <em>Hoppers 2</em> very well could be.</p><p>.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://kotaku.com/hoppers-trailer-pixar-animation-teaser-inside-out-2-1851786456]]></content:encoded>
