              <p>You want to buy something in a video game. Maybe it’s a battle pass. <a href="https://twitter.com/Wensoing/status/1965755228424425619?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">Maybe it’s a Sonic skin</a>. Maybe it’s the current <em>Halo</em> Master Chief skin. That one costs 1,500 V-Bucks, but V-Bucks only come in packs of 400 or 1,000. You now have 300 leftover V-Bucks and Epic Games has your extra money. It’s scammy and it sucks. Thankfully, it’s also going away.</p> <p>“Starting October 14, we’re adding an Exact Amount&nbsp;offer to the <em>Fortnite</em> V-Bucks purchasing page that lets you ‘top up’ your V-Bucks balance to the exact amount needed for the item you’re trying to buy,” the company announced on Thursday. “Let’s say you want an item that costs 500 V-Bucks but you only have 400 V-Bucks in your account. You’ll be able to buy just the 100 V-Bucks needed.”</p> <p>The improved payment option is coming to <em>Rocket League</em> and <em>Fall Guys</em> as well, and will be available across Xbox, Switch, PC, mobile, and…not PlayStation 4 and PS5? “We will work to make this available everywhere,” the blog post reads. Sony did not immediately respond to a request for comment.</p> <p>Forcing players to buy extra currency by mismatching it with microtransaction prices is a tale as old as digital downloads on console. Platforms like Xbox were once infamous for making players buy games with points instead of real currency, a practice <a href="https://tech.yahoo.com/gaming/article/2013-08-26-xbox-live-updated-to-real-people-money.html">that didn’t end until 2013</a>. It was such a big deal when it changed that Microsoft made the announcement at that year’s E3.</p> <p><em>Fortnite</em>‘s “top-up” option comes a couple of years after Epic reached <a href="https://kotaku.com/fornite-refund-check-file-claim-ftc-settlement-deadline-1851717873">a $245 million settlement</a> with the FTC over “dark patterns” that tricked players into unwanted purchases.</p>

              <p>All of that wall-rattling bass and gigantic surround sound coming from your expensive home theater audio setup is impressive, but if you’re watching a movie or TV show and you can’t make out the dialogue, what good is it? <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4053/">The Amazon Fire TV Soundbar Plus that’s on sale right now for just $180</a> makes those voices come through loud and clear while it puts money back in your pocket.</p>
<p>This limited-time deal takes $70 off the price of this compact, plug-and-play 3.1-channel soundbar that brings Dolby Atmos and DTS:X sound to any TV, and is also Bluetooth compatible so you can hear your favorite playlists and podcasts with the same brilliant, clear sound.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4053/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>From Box to Boom in Minutes</h2>
<p>You don’t need to be a high-end audiophile or electrician to get the Amazon Fire TV Soundbar Plus working within minutes of unboxing. Just connect it via the included cable into your TV’s HDMI eARC/ARC port, plug it into an AC outlet, and turn it on. The audio instantly moves from your TV’s built-in speakers to the soundbar, and if you’re connecting it to a Fire TV, you can use the remote control you already have to control both the TV and the soundbar — no coding or pairing necessary.</p>
<p>The compact 37-inch length and and light 8.8-pound weight of the Fire TV Soundbar Plus make it a natural fit on a mantelpiece below your wall-mounted big screen, or if you’re placing it on a TV stand, it’s low-profile enough to not block the screen. At that size and weight it’s also an easy speaker to mount to the wall. Wherever you end up placing it, the 3.1-channel sound is perfect for filling the room with rich, immersive sound without rattling the walls.</p>



<h2>All-Content Friendly</h2>
<p>The Fire TV Soundbar Plus’s voice-dedicated center channel ensures that you hear what’s being said, even during an action movie or live sports event, but that’s not coming at the expense of the rest of the sound. Four listening modes — Movie, Music, Sports, and Night — are all optimized to bring you the right sound mix at the right time. Connect your music source via Bluetooth and enjoy the extended bass from the built-in subwoofer, and hear the on-field ambient sound and roar of the crowd during the game while still hearing the play by play.</p>
<p>You don’t need to break the bank or break the walls of your home to wire up that monster surround-sound system in order to enjoy clear, high-quality sound. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4053/">Not while Amazon’s running this great deal on their Fire TV Soundbar Plus — it’s just $180 right now in a limited-time deal you will not want to miss.</a></p>
