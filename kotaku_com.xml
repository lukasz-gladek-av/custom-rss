              <p>Having a work-from-home job doesn’t necessarily mean you need to always be working&nbsp;<em>from home</em>. You feasibly have the power to work from anywhere in the world so long has you have stable Wi-Fi. The thing that used to get in the way of me getting out more often with my laptop is that I don’t like working off just my laptop screen. At my desk, I have spoiled myself with three large monitors and can see everything I’m working on at once. On my laptop, I’m caught flipping through endless tabs and apps, losing track of what I’m looking at constantly. But now, I have gotten myself a portable monitor. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4222/">You can too as this one from ASUS just dropped on Amazon from $209 to just $169. That 19% discount will save you a solid $40.</a></p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4222/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Get Out More</h2>
<p>For the worker that wants to get out and about more, ASUS’ portable monitor is perfect at it’s 15.6-inch display size. If you decide to head over to your local coffee shop or maybe get some work done in your hotel room while traveling, you can simulate your desktop experience, being able to view more of what you want to have access to at once. You can have the spreadsheet your building out on one display while you have your email or Slack opened up on the second as not to miss any pings coming your way. Or instead you can mute any incoming notifications and use your second monitor to watch the latest episode of&nbsp;<em>Peacemaker</em> while putting slides together for your next presentation on the first one.</p>
<p>The ASUS monitor has a built-in kickstand, making it easy to prop up. It can be setup in either landscape or portrait mode. I’m a big champion of the vertical display. Having your email or slack set up vertically just makes more sense than landscape. You can see more of your messages at once and be able to read more of those longwinded emails before you need to scroll down again.</p>



<p>The monitor supports a hybrid-signal, meaning the USB-C allows for the transmission of both video and power. This is wonderful because it means you’ll have less cables running across your workspace. It just needs the one USB-C cable connected from your laptop and that’s enough to turn on the portable ASUS monitor and send the video feed to it.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4222/">If you want to use the ASUS monitor as a more permanent secondary monitor,</a> you’ll be happy to learn it is tripod hold compatible, letting you mount the display.</p>

              <p><em>Vampire Survivors</em> was one of 2022’s break-out indie successes, a crudely animated 2D auto-shooter in which you moved your&nbsp;<em>Castlevania-</em>inspired character around screens filled with kerbillions of enemies, gaining new automatically triggered attacks and defenses by picking up the diamond-shaped gems dropped by fallen enemies. The more you played, the more characters you unlocked and the more skills would became available as you leveled up. Now meet <em>Megabonk</em>, a 2025 indie success, a crudely animated 3D auto-shooter in which you move your character around screens filled with kerbillions of enemies, gaining new automatically triggered attacks and defenses by picking up the diamond-shaped gems dropped by fallen enemies. The more you play, the more characters you unlock and the more skills become available as you level up.</p> <p>The absolutely blatant way in which <em>Megabonk</em> takes inspiration from <em>Vampire Survivors </em>doesn’t seem to be doing it any harm. Then again, the most played games in the world <a href="https://kotaku.com/grow-a-garden-roblox-5-million-active-users-record-pc-1851781824">are <em>Roblox-</em>made knock-offs</a>, so no big surprises there. Oh, and quite importantly,&nbsp;<em>Megabonk</em> is a ton of fun to play. I mean, a 3D&nbsp;<em>Vampire Survivors</em> sounds like it would be, right? Also, to be scrupulously fair, this game from first-time developer vedinad does have some of its own original ideas…if you look hard enough.</p> <figure id="attachment_2000627600" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000627600"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000627600">© vedinad</figcaption></figure> <p>In <em>Megabonk</em>, you move your chosen character (at the start you can choose between a nimble fox with a starting fireball and a clunky armored knight with a swingy sword) around the PS2-like 3D space, with enemies pinging into existence all around you. Much like in <em>VS</em>, you then learn how to move around in a way that’s appropriate for your attacks while trying to shepherd the crowd of enemies chasing you such that you can loop around and pick up the gems dropped by those you’ve killed. Gather enough of these and you’ll level up, and be able to pick from three randomly selected upgrades; a mix of new attacks, improvements for current ones, and various “tomes” that improve your defensive skills.</p>

 <p>Scattered around the land are vases to break for extra coins and gems, treasure chests that can be opened by spending coins and which then grant you a randomly selected bonus item), and stone pillars that, when stood near for long enough, will improve something like health regen, knockback efficacy, spawning times for elite enemies, that sort of thing. It’s about trying to maintain your health bar for as long as you can, before losing everything and returning to the main screen. Here, if you’ve managed to gather enough silver coins or reached certain milestones (killed 1,000 skeletons, say), you can unlock new characters, weapons and tomes.</p>

 <p>Which, yes, pretty much entirely describes&nbsp;<em>Vampire Survivors</em>. But here you can jump! And glide!</p> <p>For all I mock, I’m having a good time with it. It’s difficult enough from the start that it makes you want to keep finding those incremental improvements—that’s a mistake a lot of <em>Vampire Survivors</em> clones make (and let’s not forget, there have been&nbsp;<em>so many</em> of them over the last three years), where things are too easy near the start, so you get too far into your early runs before difficulty ramps up, making it feel laborious to go through it over and over. But here, as in&nbsp;<em>Vampire Survivors</em>, I’m finding there’s a sense of strategy in seeking the things that let me improve each run.</p>

 <figure id="attachment_2000627602" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000627602"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000627602">© vedinad</figcaption></figure> <p>In fact, if anything it’s just how, er, “faithfully”&nbsp;<em>Megabonk</em> sticks to the&nbsp;<em>VS</em> formula that is the secret of its success. So many knock-offs sensibly attempt to add their own twists, but too many of those break the formula. It’s perhaps not exactly high praise to point out how <em>Megabonk</em>‘s lack of originality helps it succeed, but it remains true.</p>

 <p>Despite costing twice as much as&nbsp;<em>Vampire Survivors</em> (which is still an extraordinary $5),&nbsp;<em>Megabonk</em> is proving that success in player numbers. While it’s not exactly troubling the tops of the charts, 20,000 concurrent players for a first-time dev’s crude-looking indie game is no small feat, and it only released at the end of last week. The game’s already hitting that number today, and the U.S. has barely woken up, so it seems this game is still growing. It’s also boosted by glowing Steam reviews, with the game bathing in 91 percent positive ratings, affording it the highly coveted “Overwhelmingly Positive” label. It’s that combination of a winning formula (albeit somebody else’s) and a massive amount of luck that lets Steam games occasionally see this sort of buzz. And what a treat for the developer, whomever they may be—according to their BlueSky, the game had sold over 100,000 copies by the end of the weekend.</p>   <p>That’s life-changing money, and you love to see it.</p> <p>And yes, of course there have been other 3D <em>VS</em> reimaginings, not least last year’s FPS incarnation <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2206270/Vampire_Hunters/"><em>Vampire Hunters</em></a>, but it’s so interesting when something catches the zeitgeist in this way. It’s even more satisfying when the resulting game is a bunch of fun to play, too. Even if poncle might feel like he’s owed a couple of bucks as a result.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/anker-maggo-3-in-1-charging-station-hits-all-time-low-charge-airpods-pro-3-iphone-17-and-apple-watches-at-once-2000627300</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/anker-maggo-3-in-1-charging-station-hits-all-time-low-charge-airpods-pro-3-iphone-17-and-apple-watches-at-once.1304457/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Nobody should have to decide which one of their devices gets the fast charger while the other ones get the slow version, or none at all. You carry your smartphone and earbuds and wear your smartwatch at the same time, so you should be able to fast-charge them the same way.</p>
<p>That’s what Anker’s MagGo 3-in-1 charging station does for your Apple devices, including the brand-new iPhone 17, Apple Watch 11, SE 3, and Ultra, and AirPods 4 and Pro 3. They all get 15W charging power, and your desk or nightstand get a clean, organized look with just one cable for 3 devices. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4221/">Speaking of cleaning up, that’s what you’ll be doing with this limited-time Amazon sale that cuts the price of the MagGo 3-in-1 charging station by 30%, down to just $63.</a></p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4221/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Apple Certified</h2>
<p>The Anker MagGo 3-in-1 charging station is one of the rare chargers that’s officially certified by Apple as a fast charger for the Apple Watch. It’s powerful and fast enough to bring an Apple Watch Series 10 from 0 to a full charge in just an hour and 13 minutes — over 2 hours less than other wireless chargers. (It’s not compatible with Samsung or other non-Apple smartwatches.)</p>
<p>That amazing speed also applies to your MagSafe-compatible iPhone — watch your iPhone 16 Pro Max go from totally dead to 20% in just 20 minutes, a task which takes a 7.5W wireless charger over twice as long. And the Qi pad at the rear of the stand is a perfect fit for your AirPods wireless charging case, with a non-slip surface to prevent you (or your cat) from knocking them off in the middle of the night.</p>



<h2>Nightstand Upgrade</h2>
<p>The MagGo is a charging&nbsp;<em>stand</em>, so let’s not lose sight of that feature. Your iPhone charges with equal speed in portrait or landscape position, and the powerful MagSafe grip holds the phone in place and allows you to tilt it back vertically by as much as 45 degrees. That’s perfect if you want to watch a video or take a FaceTime call at your desk hands-free while your phone charges, and on your nightstand, your iPhone can be placed in StandBy mode and act as your bedside clock, all while receiving an optimal charge.</p>
<p>Anker’s rep for top-of-the-line charging device is well established, especially for the Apple ecosystem. This one’s not going to damage that rep one bit — <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4221/">the MagGo 3-in-1 fast charger earned an Amazon’s Choice tag, and this 30% limited-time deal makes it a $63 steal</a> that will keep your devices charged and your desk or nightstand organized.</p>
