            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Amazon blew away Black Friday price expectations by lowering the price of the <strong>Fitbit Charge 6 to an all-time low</strong>, and this made high-end fitness tracking suddenly affordable for everyone. The big store decided to match that big discount for Cyber Monday and shows that it really wants to take over the fitness tracker market this holiday season.</p>
<p>The Charge 6 is a slim wristband that doesn’t look like a fitness tracker like bigger smartwatches and it has accurate heart rate monitoring, built-in GPS, Google app integration, and full health tracking. Right now, Amazon<a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5344/"> has this fitness powerhouse on sale for $99, down from its usual price of $159</a> (which is a new record low).</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5344/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Heart Rate Monitoring</h2>
<p>The Charge 6 has the <strong>best heart rate monitoring of any Fitbit ever made</strong>, and it has better optical sensors and smarter algorithms that get rid of motion artifacts. That level of accuracy is important because the tracker can now send your heart rate directly to gym equipment that works with it via Bluetooth. This means you don’t have to wear chest straps like many cardio machines do for heart rate training programs. The <strong>built-in GPS keeps track of your outdoor runs, walks, and bike rides</strong> with the same level of accuracy as dedicated running watches.</p>
<p>The <strong>Fitbit Charge 6’s touchscreen</strong> interface lets you control YouTube Music, navigate Google Maps and make payments with Google Wallet right from your wrist. That ecosystem connection makes the tracker a useful everyday device instead of just a workout buddy. You can switch songs while you run, get turn-by-turn directions to new places, or pay for coffee without taking out your wallet.</p>



<p>Comprehensive health tracking goes beyond just counting steps as it also keeps an eye on heart rate variability, blood oxygen levels while you sleep, changes in skin temperature, and stress management through guided breathing exercises. <em>Zone of Activity Minutes</em> count how long you spend in high heart rate zones during workouts, so you get credit for intensity as well as duration.</p>
<p>With normal use, <strong>like 24/7 heart rate monitoring, daily GPS workouts, and notification sync</strong>, the battery lasts about seven days. This means you don’t have to charge it every night like most smartwatches do. You can track your sleep every night without worrying about the battery dying because it lasts for a week. You only need to remember to charge it once a week. The slim design fits comfortably under shirt cuffs and doesn’t get caught on clothes or make pressure points when worn all day.</p>



<p>Smart notifications keep you connected by <strong>showing calls, texts, and app alerts on the color touchscreen</strong> of the tracker. However, the only way to respond on Android devices is with quick replies. In addition to fitness features, calendar alerts, weather updates, and timer functions make the device useful every day. The Fitbit app lets you sync the <strong>device wirelessly with both iOS and Android phones</strong> and it also has detailed analytics, trend tracking, and social features that let you compete with friends through challenges.</p>
<p>When you think about how much similar fitness trackers cost (between $150 and $200 without Google integration or heart rate broadcasting from gym equipment) getting the Fitbit Charge 6 for $99 is a great deal. For less than $100, you can get a tracker that will help you train smarter, learn more about your body, and stay in touch all day long.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/amazon-clears-out-airpods-pro-3-for-cyber-monday-liquidates-black-friday-leftovers-at-record-low-price-2000648949</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Apple just came out with the AirPods Pro 3 a few months ago, and as usual, the company won’t directly discount its newest high-end earbuds. Amazon really stepped up on Black Friday with a big price drop on these great wireless earbuds and the good news is that the store decided to keep the discount going and even make it bigger for Cyber Monday. Right now, <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4214/">Amazon has them marked down to $219 right now, reduced from Apple’s standard $249 price</a>, creating the best deal we’ve seen on these earbuds.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4214/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Double Noise Cancellation</h2>
<p>The <strong>AirPods Pro 3 block out twice as much unwanted noise as the already great AirPods Pro 2</strong>, and they create isolation that is as good as that of over-ear headphones, but in a small in-ear package. That better noise cancellation works by using microphones that pick up sounds from the outside world and computer-generated audio that creates exact anti-noise in real time.</p>
<p>When<strong> you turn on transparency mode</strong>, the earbuds let outside sounds in so you can hear conversations and environmental cues without taking them off. Apple improved this mode by adding active hearing protection that automatically lowers loud sounds from the environment like construction noise or subway screeches, while still letting normal sounds through.</p>



<p>The new acoustic architecture changes the sound quality by <strong>giving the bass more depth, making the voices sound</strong> incredibly clear across the frequency range, and making the vocals sound incredibly present. <strong>Dynamic head tracking and spatial audio</strong> make three-dimensional soundscapes that put sound sources around you in space. This makes movies and supported music feel more immersive than traditional stereo can.</p>
<p>Heart rate sensing is a real game-changer for earbuds because they have built-in sensors that track your pulse while you work out without needing chest straps or wrist-based monitors. The earbuds keep track of heart rate and calories burned <strong>during more than 50 different types of workouts</strong>, and they then automatically sync this data to Apple Health for full fitness tracking. When you connect your iPhone, you can use the activity rings, step counting, and the new Workout Buddy feature powered by Apple Intelligence that gives you personalized training suggestions.</p>



<p><strong>Apple Intelligence’s live translation</strong> feature makes it possible to talk to people who speak different languages by providing real-time translation. The feature works by processing speech on your iPhone and translating between supported languages, and the translation plays through your earbuds while the other person hears their native language through your phone’s speaker. This conversational translation works well enough for travel, business meetings, or casual conversations where language differences would normally make it hard to communicate.</p>
<p>When you turn on active noise cancellation, the battery lasts for eight hours. When you use transparency mode with the hearing aid feature on, the battery lasts for up to ten hours. That runtime lasts through full workdays, long flights, or long listening sessions without needing to charge the case. The USB-C charging case lets you charge your device multiple times, <strong>and gives you more than 30 hours of total listening time</strong> before you need to plug it in. <strong>Five different ear tip sizes</strong> make sure that everyone can find a secure, comfortable fit that creates the right acoustic seal for the best noise cancellation and bass response.</p>
<p>When you think about how these just came out a few months ago and Apple never directly discounts new products, getting the AirPods Pro 3 for $219 is a good deal. These earbuds are on sale for Cyber Monday for $30 less than their regular price, and they have features that other products won’t have for years.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Roborock Q7 Max+ With 9 Weeks Self-Empty Crashes to Record Low, Cyber Monday Goes Zero Profit for Final Clearance]]></title>
            <link>https://kotaku.com/roborock-q7-max-with-9-weeks-self-empty-crashes-to-record-low-cyber-monday-goes-zero-profit-for-final-clearance-2000648933</link>
            <guid>1368784</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Roborock makes a lot more than just the high-end flagship $1000+ models that get a lot of attention in tech reviews and forums for fans. The brand makes cheaper models that still have important features like self-emptying docks and these are some of the best value options on the robot vacuum market.</p>
<p>For instance, the Q7 M5+ has 10,000Pa of suction, two brushes that don’t tangle, LiDAR navigation and a base that empties itself and holds up to seven weeks of debris – and it costs a lot less than some flagship models. The good news is that Amazon <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5418/">has just cut the price of this combo to $219 for Cyber Monday, down from its usual price of $359</a> and this is the lowest price ever.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5418/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Easy to empty yourself without the high price tag</h2>
<p>The<strong> RockDock Plus base station automatically empties the robot’s dustbin</strong> into a sealed bag <strong>that holds about seven to nine weeks’ worth of dirt, pet hair</strong>&nbsp;and other debris, depending on how big your home is and how messy it is. Because of that extra space, you can basically forget about taking care of your vacuum for almost two months.</p>
<p>Instead of emptying dustbins after every cleaning session, you can just check in every so often to change bags. The sealed bag system keeps allergens and fine dust particles from getting into the air when you empty it by hand and it makes it perfect for homes with allergies or sensitivities. When the bag is full, you can quickly lift it up and put it back down again without making dust clouds or having to touch the dirt that has built up.</p>
<p>The<strong> 10,000Pa HyperForce suction picks up everything from fine dust on hardwood floors to pet hair</strong> that has been stuck in carpets without needing to go over the same area more than once: That level of suction is comparable to models that cost twice as much, and it works well on all types of floors. Roborock made the dual anti-tangle system with JawScrapers’ main brush technology which stops hair from getting stuck in the roller and it also has a side brush that won’t get tangled even when cleaning up long human hair or shedding from double-coated dogs.</p>



<p>PreciSense LiDAR navigation makes precise floor plans of your home and shows where rooms and furniture are so that you can clean them more quickly. Unlike older models,<strong> this vacuum doesn’t bump around your space at random</strong> and instead, it follows planned paths that make sure it covers everything without going over the same area more than once. You can also use the Roborock app to set no-go zones so that the vacuum doesn’t go near pet food bowls, delicate rugs, or places with cables. Virtual walls make boundaries without needing to put up physical barriers.</p>
<p>This <strong>combination vacuum and mop can pick up both dry and sticky messes</strong> in one pass: It automatically switches between modes based on the type of floor and your preferences. With three adjustable water flow settings, you can choose how much water to use when mopping. For example, you can use light moisture on sealed hardwood or heavier flow on tile and laminate that can handle more water.</p>



<p>The vacuum works just as well on carpets as it does on hard floors because it automatically adjusts the suction power when it detects rugs or carpets and lowers it on hard surfaces to save battery life. The edge cleaning works well because the side brush can get into corners and along baseboards where dirt builds up. The <strong>design is small enough to fit under furniture and around chair legs</strong>&nbsp;which lets it get to places that upright vacuums can’t.</p>
<p>For $219, you can get the Roborock Q7 M5+ with its self-emptying dock and it is a great deal because similar systems from iRobot or Shark usually cost between $400 and $600. Here you can get a robot vacuum system that makes it easy to keep your floors clean every day.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/macbooks-survived-black-friday-and-apple-went-even-lower-new-record-low-for-cyber-monday-2000648940</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Apple avoids running direct promotions on its products but Amazon has taken matters into its own hands with aggressive discounting throughout this shopping season. The online giant crushed MacBook Air M4 sales during Black Friday after slashing prices significantly, but Cyber Monday brings an even deeper cut that pushes the deal into record territory.</p>
<p>Right now, the 2025 MacBook Air with the M4 chip, 16GB unified memory, and <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5068/">256GB storage is going for $738, down from Apple’s standard $999 price</a> and undercuts even the Black Friday deal by roughly $10<strong> to hit an all-time low for Cyber Monday</strong>.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5068/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>M4 Chip Performance</h2>
<p>The M4 chip has desktop-level performance that can handle tough tasks like editing 4K video, doing complicated spreadsheet calculations, or running multiple virtual machines without breaking a sweat. Apple’s second-generation 3-nanometer architecture packs more transistors into less space while using less power which means that it can process data faster and use less power than the already impressive M3 generation.</p>
<p>The 16GB of unified memory is a big step up from the 8GB base model that Apple used to ship and makes it easy to multitask across dozens of browser tabs, creative apps, and background processes. That <strong>memory architecture lets the CPU and GPU share resources</strong> without the slowdowns that happen on regular laptops when the graphics and processor have to fight for separate memory pools.</p>
<p>The<strong> battery lasts about 18 hours of normal</strong> use so you can get through a whole day of meetings, document editing, and web browsing without having to look for outlets. That level of performance stays the same whether you’re running on battery or plugged in, which is a problem with many Windows laptops when they’re unplugged. The MacBook Air is completely silent when it’s running because it doesn’t have a fan.</p>



<p>The <strong>13.6-inch Liquid Retina display can show one billion colors and is 500 nits bright</strong> so photos and videos look great with bright colors and deep contrast. Text looks sharp at the native resolution, which is easier on the eyes than lower-resolution displays when reading or coding for long periods of time. That screen space gives you enough room to work on multiple things at once while keeping the laptop small enough to fit in most bags without taking up too much space.</p>
<p><strong>Apple Intelligence integration adds AI features</strong> directly to macOS without needing cloud processing or paying for basic features. The system helps with writing, making content, and productivity workflows, and it does all of this on the device to protect your privacy. Your data never leaves your machine because it is processed locally. This solves privacy issues that come up with cloud-based AI services. Two Thunderbolt 4 ports let you transfer data at lightning speed and drive up to two external displays at the same time.</p>



<p>The <strong>MacBook Air runs macOS without any problems</strong> and all of your important apps, like Microsoft 365 Copilot, Adobe Creative Cloud, and Google Workspace, work perfectly thanks to Apple Silicon optimization. iPhone integration works great with features like iPhone Mirroring, which lets you control your phone from your Mac, Universal Clipboard, which lets you copy content between devices, and Continuity Camera, which turns your iPhone into a wireless webcam.</p>
<p>When you think about how much Apple charges for this exact configuration directly, $999, getting the MacBook Air M4 for $738 is a great deal. This Cyber Monday price is $261 less than retail and gets you professional-level performance and a high-quality build. It’s the perfect time to upgrade from old Intel MacBooks or cheap Windows laptops.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/chatplayground-packs-25-ai-tools-into-one-at-nearly-90-off-chatgpt-gemini-claude-perplexity-and-more-included-2000648823</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>AI tools aren’t exactly the demons most people make them out to be; if you know how to use them right. At this point, there are more than a dozen options out there, each offering a whole bunch of beneficial features that you can use to excel in studies, research, and even in your professional life. If you want to compare them all in one place and choose what works best for you, we’ve got good news.</p>
<p>ChatPlayground AI is a platform that lets you explore and compare outputs from 25+ top AI tools side by side, in a single place. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6109/">A one-month subscription usually costs $29, but Stacksocial is offering<strong> lifetime access</strong> to the platform for just $80, after a whopping 87% discount.</a> It’s a leftover Black Friday deal, but it’s selling out fast. At the time of writing, over 500 subscriptions have already been sold, so you don’t have a lot of time left to save. Jump in on it while it’s still live.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6109/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at StackSocial</a></p>

<h2>All Your Favorite AI Tools In One Place</h2>
<p>Starting with what the subscription gets you; it offers unlimited prompts across all the AI platforms, whether it’s GPT, Gemini, or DeepSeek. There is no lengthy requirement sheet with this one. Your system just needs to have the latest version of Chrome, Edge, or Firefox to get started. Once your purchase is successful, Stacksocial will send the relevant links and code to your email, which you need to redeem within 30 days of your purchase.</p>
<p>The platform gets you access to over 25 popular AI giants like GPT-4o, Claude Sonnet 4, Gemini 1.5 Flash, DeepSeek V3, and more. Entering a single prompt delivers instant results from various AI models simultaneously, letting you compare their responses and pick the best according to your needs. You can use it to create images using text, refine text, edit documents, generate summaries for research papers that would normally take hours to read, and get quick answers to all your questions. Importing your own files is supported just as well.</p>



<p>There’s a built-in web search feature for up-to-date responses, and you can even refer back to previous conversations you had with the AI tools whenever you want. The Chrome extension integrates the platform into your everyday life, making it easy to get the help you want within seconds, without even launching the program manually. Those struggling to get efficient responses can head over to the prompt library that includes a wide range of ready-to-use prompts for optimal results. Best of all, the models can understand and respond in over 100 languages, so you can use what you’re most comfortable with.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6109/">On a normal day, you’d pay around $619 to enjoy lifetime access to all these features, but this deal takes a massive $539 off that not-so-friendly price tag</a>. But as you’d expect, it expires soon, so it’s best to grab it while it’s still live. If you want to explore more, other plans are also discounted. For instance, a lifetime subscription to the Pro plan is going for $50 after an 85% discount, while the Basic plan can be yours for $35, down from $204. That said, there are plenty of other lingering Black Friday deals on Stacksocial that are still going strong, even after the main event has wrapped up. It’s a great time to treat yourself to a service that feels slightly out of reach the rest of the year, and even gift it to a loved one!</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/amazon-out-of-time-with-thousands-of-galaxy-tab-a9-goes-zero-profit-for-cyber-monday-clearance-2000648929</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>If you’ve been waiting for Cyber Monday to get a cheap Samsung tablet, your wait is over – and we’re not talking about the Galaxy Tab S11 Ultra which costs almost $1,000 with premium specs. Instead, we’re talking about a budget-friendly Galaxy Tab A9+ model that can handle everyday tasks without breaking the bank. Amazon <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3880/">has cut the price of this 64GB/WiFi version from $219 to $139</a>, which makes it a great deal for an 11-inch tablet that can do a lot of things.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3880/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>11-Inch Screen</h2>
<p>The <strong>Tab A9+ has an 11-inch TFT LCD panel with a resolution of 1920×1200</strong> which makes text sharp enough to read and colors bright enough to stream video. The <strong>90Hz refresh rate</strong> makes scrolling through social media and web pages feel much smoother than standard 60Hz displays, and it adds a little bit of fluidity that makes the whole experience better.</p>



<p><strong>Dolby Atmos processing powers</strong> the quad speakers on all four edges which give surprisingly strong sound and it <strong>creates spatial sound</strong> that makes movies, games, and music sound better than most tablets in this price range. The speakers make dialogue clear without muddiness and are loud enough to fill a small room. This audio setup turns the tablet into a portable entertainment device that doesn’t need external speakers or headphones to enjoy content fully.</p>
<p>The Qualcomm Snapdragon 695 chipset and 4GB of RAM <strong>work together to handle everyday tasks</strong> like web browsing, email, social media, and streaming services without any annoying lag or stuttering. The 64GB of internal storage fills up quickly with apps, photos, and content that can be accessed offline. The good news is that there’s also a <strong>microSD card slot can hold cards up to 1TB</strong> which is a cheap way to add more storage.</p>



<p>With multi-window display, <strong>you can run more than one app on the same screen</strong> at the same time. For example, you can split the screen between a web browser and a note-taking app or watch YouTube while checking your email. This feature turns the tablet from a simple device for consuming content into a modest productivity tool that can handle basic work tasks or multitasking situations. <strong>Samsung’s One UI interface makes Android 13</strong> work better on larger screens by using gestures that are easy to understand and tablet-specific layouts that make better use of the space than phones that are blown up to tablet size.</p>
<p>With<em> Quick Share</em>, you can <strong>move files between Samsung devices and even iOS devices with just a few taps</strong>. This means you don’t have to email attachments or upload files to the cloud when you want to share photos or documents. You can charge the tablet with a USB-C cable and it usually lasts 8 to 10 hours of mixed use, like streaming, browsing, and light gaming, before you need to plug it in.</p>
<p>You can save $80 on a tablet that has really useful features at a low price by getting the Galaxy Tab A9+ for $139 instead of $219. For less than what many 8-inch tablets with worse specs cost, you get an 11-inch 90Hz display, quad speakers with Dolby Atmos, decent performance for everyday tasks, and Samsung’s polished software experience.</p>

              <p>The DualSense Edge controller from Sony is rarely on sale because competitive gamers and PlayStation fans who want pro-level customization always want it. The price finally went down to $169 on Black Friday which is less than the usual $199 but Amazon is going even lower for Cyber Monday, bringing it down to $159. If you waited until Black Friday to see if the deal would get better, your patience has paid off with this new record low that makes upgrading to pro controller features much cheaper than it was just a few days ago.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6119/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Customized Controller</h2>
<p>Sony <strong>made the DualSense Edge with replaceable stick modules</strong> to fix the most common problem with modern controllers: worn potentiometers inside the thumbstick assemblies that cause analog stick drift. If you use the controller for months or years and it starts to drift, you can just replace the module instead of the whole $200 controller and this modular method saves money in the long run and keeps your investment working like new.</p>



<p>What’s more, <strong>the two back buttons can be attached to either backplate</strong> and give you a total of four extra inputs that you can program to act like any other button on the controller. This placement lets you keep your thumbs on the analog sticks during important times instead of moving them to the face buttons and it gives you an edge in shooters where jumping or crouching while keeping aim control makes the difference between winning and losing.</p>
<p>You <strong>can set how far the L2 and R2 triggers travel before registering a full press</strong> with adjustable trigger stops. There are three preset distances that cover everything from hair-trigger sensitivity to full range motion. The shortest setting is best for fast-paced FPS games because it lets you fire weapons with very little finger movement, which cuts down on reaction time by milliseconds that are important in competitive play.</p>
<p>You can<strong> completely change the functions of any button on the PS5</strong> by going to the accessory settings: You can also turn off certain buttons if you keep accidentally pressing them. You can change crouch from circle to a back button, jump from L1 to L2, or make your own layouts that work with how you remember how to play on other platforms. The controller saves these settings to three different profiles that are stored in the hardware: You can switch between them right away by holding down the profile button and picking the one you want. This means you can have a profile that works best for Call of Duty, one that works best for Fortnite, and one that works best for racing games without having to change settings every time you switch games.</p>



<p>The <strong>braided USB cable that comes with the controller has a connector housing that keeps it in place</strong> so you won’t accidentally disconnect it while you’re playing wired. This also means you won’t have to deal with the annoyance of losing connection in the middle of a match because the cable wiggled loose. The carrying case protects the controller and holds all the extra parts, like spare stick caps, back button sets, and the connector housing.</p>
<p>The battery life is a little shorter than the standard DualSense because of the extra hardware for customization features: It <strong>usually lasts 5–7 hours of active play</strong> while the base model lasts 8-12 hours.</p>
<p>Grabbing the DualSense Edge for $159 instead of $199 saves you $40 on professional controller features that typically command premium pricing across the gaming industry. With the Cyber Monday pricing ending soon, this record low represents your best opportunity to upgrade your PS5 gaming experience before stock clears.</p>

              <p>Bose surprised shoppers who thought Black Friday deals were over by dropping the price of its <em>QuietComfort</em> noise cancelling headphones to an all-time low on Cyber Monday, and this makes it much easier to choose between Sony, Sonos or Apple models. These headphones <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4702/">are now $199 on Amazon, down from their usual price of $349 which is a record-breaking 43% discount</a> that makes premium noise cancellation available at a mid-tier price.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4702/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Great ANC Headphones</h2>
<p>Bose designed these headphones with <strong>cutting-edge noise-canceling technology that uses both active electronic canceling and passive physical isolation</strong> from the over-ear design, and it makes a quiet bubble even in loud places like airplane cabins or busy coffee shops. The system listens to background noise thousands of times per second and makes sound waves that are exactly opposite to the noise coming in, so it cancels it out before it reaches your ears.</p>



<p>Aware mode changes things up by u<strong>sing external microphones to send sounds from the outside world into your ears</strong>: This lets you hear announcements, conversations or traffic without taking off your headphones. You can talk to people while wearing the headphones in this transparency mode, but voices sound a little different than when you hear them directly. You can also switch between modes with the push of a button, so you can do it right away when a flight attendant comes up to you or when you need to cross the street safely.</p>
<p>The <strong>audio quality has the warm, bass-heavy sound that Bose fans love</strong>&nbsp;<strong>with deep lows</strong> that make kick drums and basslines sound heavier without drowning out vocals or high-frequency details. You can change the bass, mid-range and treble levels in the Bose Music app to fit your preferences or make up for how you hear things. This changes the sound profile from bass-heavy to balanced or treble-focused, depending on what you like.</p>



<p>The soft memory foam and synthetic protein leather that make up the <strong>plush over-ear cushions feel good against your skin</strong> and make a good seal without putting too much pressure on your head. The padded headband spreads the weight evenly across the top of your head and stop the pressure points that make you uncomfortable after wearing them for hours at a time. These headphones are comfortable enough for long flights or full workdays without making your ears tired or giving you headaches.</p>
<p>With noise cancellation on, <strong>the battery can last up to 24 hours on a single charge</strong> which means you can go for days without needing to charge it again, even on long international flights. With USB-C quick charging, you can listen for 2.5 hours after just 15 minutes of charging, which is great if you forget to charge it overnight. When Bluetooth isn’t available or the battery runs out, the included audio cable with an inline microphone turns these into wired headphones.</p>
<p>Right now, you can get these <em>QuietComfort</em> headphones for $199 instead of $349, which is $150 less than the usual price for noise-canceling technology. You’re getting Bose’s best ANC performance, a battery life of 24 hours, comfortable all-day wear, and better sound quality for less than what Sony’s WH-1000XM4 usually costs on sale.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/samsung-goes-all-in-for-cyber-monday-34-viewfinity-borderless-monitor-is-now-priced-like-a-budget-no-name-brand-2000648828</link>
            <guid>1368733</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>The last place you want to feel cramped is your computer screen. You can only keep so many windows and tabs open at the same time before a small screen makes you feel claustrophobic, and small screens for gaming? Yeah, they suck. This year make Cyber Monday the day you lose your big-screen FOMO forever — <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6107/">Samsung’s 34-inch ViewFinity Ultra-WQHD S50GC ultrawide monitor is practically begging you to click Buy Now at Amazon at just $210.</a></p>
<p>This Cyber Monday deal is taking an already well-priced ultrawide from a leading manufacturer — the ViewFinity S50 normally sells for $330 — and turns into an absolute must-have at 36% off. With this 21:9 ultrawide format creating an enormous horizontal space for work or play and doing it with outstanding resolution and super-fast refresh time, it’s one of the most versatile monitors available in this price range for Cyber Monday or any other day.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6107/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>More Space, More Potential</h2>
<p>Unless you’ve already experienced the difference between a standard 16:9 monitor and a 21:9 ultrawide, it has to be seen to be truly believed. It’s not just the screen that’s bigger, the larger aspect ratio actually shows you more picture that is lost in 16:9 mode. That’s especially true for many games, where that extra peripheral vision comes in exceptionally handy.</p>
<p>The extra visual real estate isn’t wasted on a lousy picture, either. The Samsung ViewFinity S50’s WQHD (Wide Quad High Definition) images are delivered with a crisp 100Hz refresh rate and AMD FreeSync support for silky-smooth motion and no tearing. It’s HDR10 with support for over a billion colors and a 3000:1 static contrast ratio, so your photo or video editing work can be done on a sharp and color-accurate workspace, your streaming looks amazing and moves flawlessly, and your gaming is more immersive than ever before.</p>
<p>Here’s something your 16:9 monitor almost certainly can’t compete with — the ViewFinity S50 supports Picture-by-Picture (PBP) and Picture-in-Picture (PIP). You can connect two devices — a console via the HDMI input port and a PC via the DisplayPort, for example — and see them on the same screen at the same time. Or two PCs, or a PC and a Mac — you get the idea. It’s something a $210 monitor really has no business doing.</p>



<h2>Flat Is Fine</h2>
<p>Samsung’s vast fleet of high-quality monitors includes several curved models — the ViewFinity S50 is not one of them. But, while some people swear by a curved monitor, many don’t, and they’re the ones who will be most intrigued by an exceptional monitor that gives you the ultrawide 21:9 aspect ratio and larger field of view&nbsp;<em>without</em> being curved.</p>
<p>The performance of the ViewFinity S50 certainly isn’t diminished at all by not being curved, and with TÜV-certified Intelligent Eye Care features that include adaptive brightness, blue-light reduction, and flicker-free backlight, the ViewFinity S50 also won’t wear out your eyes.</p>
<p>Cyber Monday’s traditionally the day for amazing deals on tech upgrades, and if you have an average or slightly long-in-the-tooth older monitor, the Samsung ViewFinity S50 is most definitely going to be an upgrade. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6107/">The $210 price at Amazon is also pretty much unbeatable.</a></p>

            <title><![CDATA[Dyson Has V11 Vacuum Black Friday Leftovers, Now Near Zero Profit to Clear Stock for Cyber Monday]]></title>
            <link>https://kotaku.com/dyson-has-v11-vacuum-black-friday-leftovers-now-near-zero-profit-to-clear-stock-for-cyber-monday-2000648918</link>
            <guid>1368577</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Dyson still sells older models like the V8 that launched nearly a decade ago, but if you want cleaning power that really removes embedded dirt from carpets, you need something more recent with stronger suction and better brush technology. The newest Gen5 models cost around $1,000 which feels excessive for a vacuum regardless of how good it performs so finding middle ground makes sense for most households.</p>
<p>The Dyson V11 Origin hits that sweet spot with powerful suction and modern features without the premium flagship pricing and <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4478/">Amazon just dropped it to $399 for Cyber Monday weekend, down from the usual $629</a>. This marks a record low for post-Black Friday clearance and offers 37% off one of Dyson’s most capable cordless vacuums.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4478/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>185 Air Watts That Clean Carpets Deeply</h2>
<p>The <strong>Dyson V11 has 185 air watts of suction power</strong> which is 60% more than earlier V-series models, and it has enough power to pull dirt that is stuck in carpet fibers that other cordless vacuums leave behind. The motorbar cleaner head has a<strong> motorized brush bar with anti-tangle technology</strong> that actively removes hair that has gotten stuck in it while you clean. This means you won’t have to cut hair off the roller every few days which is a pain, and it is very important if you have pets or long hair in the house because regular brush bars turn into useless tangles of hair after a week of use.</p>



<p>You can<strong> choose between three power modes to control the balance</strong> between suction strength and runtime. Auto mode automatically changes the power level based on the type of floor and the amount of dirt, giving you the best cleaning while using the least amount of battery power for everyday tasks. By lowering suction, Eco mode can extend runtime by up to 60 minutes which is great for quick touch-ups or cleaning big areas with light dirt. When you have to clean up a lot of tracked-in mud or pet accidents, boost mode gives you the most suction for about five minutes. The <strong>LCD screen shows the current power mode</strong>, how much time is left until the battery runs out (down to the second), maintenance alerts when the filters need to be cleaned and blockage alerts when something blocks the system.</p>
<p>The hair screw tool has a conical brush bar that is made to spiral long hair and pet hair into the collection bin without getting tangled: It makes it very useful for cleaning upholstery, stairs, and car interiors where pet hair gets stuck deep down. The crevice tool can get into tight spaces between cushions and along baseboards. The mini soft dusting brush, on the other hand, is great for cleaning delicate surfaces like lampshades and keyboards<strong>. In just a few seconds, you can also switch to handheld mode by taking off the wand</strong>.</p>



<p>Advanced <strong>whole-machine filtration catches 99.99% of particles as small as 0.3 microns</strong> and keeps allergens, dust mites, and pet dander inside the sealed system instead of letting them back into the air. People with allergies will benefit greatly from this HEPA-level filtration because the air that comes out is cleaner than the air in most homes. The bagless design lets you empty the bin with just one button press which ejects dirt without you having to touch it.</p>
<p>The lithium-ion battery keeps the suction strong as it drains, unlike older nickel-based batteries which lose power slowly over time. The docking station that hangs on the wall charges the vacuum and keeps the tools that come with it close at hand so everything is organized and ready for quick cleanups. And it <strong>takes about 4.5 hours to charge from empty to full</strong>&nbsp;and you can still take the battery out if you want to buy a spare for long cleaning sessions.</p>
<p>Instead of paying $629 for the V11 Origin, you can get it for $399 and it saves you $230 on a vacuum that usually stays at a high price because it is Dyson’s best-selling model between entry-level and flagship levels. This is your last chance to get premium Dyson performance before stock runs out and prices go back up.</p>

              <p>Anker has been breaking its own records with portable charging solutions lately, and we’re here for it. If you rely on multiple devices to get through your day, like your smartphone, smartwatch, and earbuds, you need something that can top all three up without the usual cord clutter. The Anker 3-in-1 MagGo UFO charger for iOS does exactly that, and today is a great time to pick one up without paying the full price.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6106/">On a regular day, you’d expect to pay around $90 for it, but thanks to Cyber Monday, this all-in-one charging solution just dropped to $57, after a nice 36% discount.</a> All color options are discounted, but the prices vary. For instance, the black and pink versions are sitting at $57, while the white is going for $56, $1 less. The Teal version, on the other hand, is up for grabs at $59. All the offers are open to all shoppers, meaning you can score the discount whether you’re a Prime member or not.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6106/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>The Size of a Baseball</h2>
<p>When folded, this charger is the size of a baseball and resembles a macaron in looks. It’s much more compact than traditional adapters, meaning you can just slip it into your pocket and get going. Sturdiness comes from the built-in silicone strap, while the skin-friendly texture makes it comfortable to take it with you on the go. When opened, it offers three charging stations for three of your essentials; iPhone, Apple Watch, and AirPods.</p>
<p>Just drop each on its respective station, and it’s going to top them up in no time. Even better, you don’t always have to lay the whole thing open to use it. Support for Standby mode lets you keep the charger folded and still use your phone in landscape, which is perfect for when you want to stream a show, set a timer, display a calendar, or take a quick video call while it’s being powered.</p>



<p>The 15W capacity isn’t massive, but it’s enough to power your devices without much waiting. It can get an iPhone 15 Pro to 20% in 15 minutes and an Apple Watch Series 9 to 30% in 22 minutes. As for the compatibility, the charger plays nicely with iPhone Series 12 through 17 (except iPhone SE), Apple Watch Series 11/10/9/8/7 Ultra, plus Apple Watch Series 1-6, AirPods 2/3/4, and AirPods Pro 2, as well as the latest Pro 3.</p>
<p>Safety is taken just as seriously. ActiveShield 2.0 monitors temperature over 3,000,000 times per day to prevent overheating. The box comes with the wireless charging station, a 40W adapter, a 5 ft (1.5 m) USB-C to USB-C cable, a welcome guide, and a 24-month warranty for some extra peace of mind.</p>
<p>This early Cyber Monday deal lets you save an impressive $33 on a compact, all-in-one charging solution that’s both efficient and portable. You can use it on your trips if you like travelling light, or even at home to reduce the typical cord clutter. In fact, it can also make a great gift for a tech enthusiast in your life! There are multiple color options to choose from, which makes it easy to pick the ones that suit your aesthetics the best. Looking for something basic? Go for the black version. Want something with a bit more personality? The pink and teal versions look stunning. Again, you might want to act fast to grab the deal, and it won’t be around for long.</p>
