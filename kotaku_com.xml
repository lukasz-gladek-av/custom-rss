              <p>It’s pretty unlikely that the “wee but mighty” metaphor that goes all the way back to Shakespeare was created with the very wee, very mighty Samsung P9 Express microSD card in mind. In fact, if you were caught with such a device back in the Bard’s day, you probably would have been burned for witchcraft. But considering that the P9 Express is 0.59 x 0.43 inches in size and less than 1 one-hundredth of an ounce in weight, yet able to boost the storage on literally dozens of different devices by over half a terabyte, its wee-but-mighty status is undeniable.</p>
<p>Also wee? <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5799/">The P9 Express microSD card’s price, which is just $80 right now at Amazon</a>. But if you’re looking to score big, reliable, fast-moving storage to your Nintendo Switch 2, drone, camera, laptop, tablet, or most anything else, you should get to Amazon mighty fast, because the shelves are emptying and emptying fast.</p>

<h2>Switch 2 Superstar</h2>
<p>Samsung is leaning hard into selling the P9 Express microSD card to Nintendo Switch 2 owners, which is smart thinking when you consider just how big a smash hit that handheld gaming console has been. The selling point for Switch 2 games isn’t just the great sale price or the 512GB of storage the P9 Express adds to the console. It’s the speed, which as any gamer will you, is absolutely essential.</p>
<p>The P9 Express moves data at speeds of up to 800 MB/s, which is four times faster than even Samsung’s standard microSD cards. When you’re booting up a game from a parallel storage unit rather than the Switch 2’s built-in storage, a standard microSD card might lag, but the P9 Express will have your game up and running in a snap, and more importantly, it will run smoothly and lag-free.</p>
<p>As a game and downloadable content repository, the P9 Express will get a serious workout inside a Switch 2. But Samsung’s Dynamic Thermal Guard technology keeps things cool within the tiny P9 Express to ward off overheating-related slowdowns or bricking.</p>



<h2>Universal Storage</h2>
<p>Even if the Samsung P9 Express only worked with the Switch 2, there would be a pretty solid case to hit this Amazon deal and snag one for just $80. But the list of tech items the P9 Express brings seamless, fast, reliable storage to is long indeed. Basically, any device with a microSD slot, since the P9 Express is also reverse-compatible with UHS-I devices. That covers a lot of ground — everything from smartphones and tablets to digital cameras and drones. It also comes with a 3-year warranty, and chances are you’ll never need to file a claim since the P9 Express is built to withstand x-rays, magnets, drops, water, high and low temperatures, and the wear and tear that comes with being inserted into and removed from devices.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5799/">With Amazon’s 33% off deal in place, the $80 price for the 512GB Samsung P9 Express microSD card</a> is a small one indeed for a tiny chip that&nbsp;<em>triples</em> the storage of a Nintendo Switch 2, and also works across such a vast array of tech devices. But Amazon’s hung out that big red “Deal Selling Fast” tag on this one, so move fast before you miss out.</p>

              <p>Running out of storage, especially when you’re in the middle of something important, can be frustrating. It’s more common than you think but thankfully, there are quite a few external solutions that can help prevent the issue. The most convenient out of these are portable SSDs, which not just offer the storage capacity you need, but also powerful speeds in a lightweight, compact build.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/7023/">Those shopping for one can consider picking up the 4TB Crucial X10 Pro SSD, which is now going for $420 at Amazon</a>. That’s after the retailer knocked its usual $525 price by 20%. This offer applies to the black color option, and it’s open to both Prime and non-Prime members.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/7023/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Portable But Powerful</h2>

Basically, it’s specifically made for on-the-go usage and can survive everyday bumps and hits well, while protecting your important data.</p>
<p>Despite the easy-to-carry, compact build, the drive is quite spacious. This version offers 4TB of storage capacity, which is more than enough to house all your current and future essential files comfortably. Think thousands of high-resolution photos, a ton of videos, heavy work documents, large software, and even a few gaming titles. Whether you’re a creative with an ever-growing media library or a gamer looking to manage their favorite titles better, this drive does the job well.</p>



<p>Speeds are just as impressive. With the Crucial X10 Pro, you’re looking at around 2,100MB/s read and 2,000MB/s write speeds for a seamless workflow. These ensure quicker file access, and fast transfer times, meaning you can get stuff done without waiting around for long. As for compatibility, the drive plays nicely with a wide range of devices, including Windows, Mac, iPad Pro, Chromebooks, Android, Linux, PS4, PS5, and Xbox via USB-C and USB-A. What’s even better is that you will be able to safeguard your data with SSD password protection for enhanced security. This feature can especially come in handy if you’re often on the move and prefer taking your tech accessories along.</p>
<p>Your purchase will also come with a three-month free trial of Mylio Photos Plus and Acronis True Image, both of which make it easy to manage, sort, and protect your digital data. In short, if you’ve been looking for an easy way to manage storage better, this 4TB Crucial X10 Pro SSD can help. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/7023/">You can now pick it up for $420, after Amazon slashed its retail price by 20%. If 4TB is more capacity than you need, there’s a 1TB and 2TB version of the same drive available, as well.</a></p>

<p data-start="0" data-end="507">Apple’s AirPods have become one of the most recognizable accessories in modern consumer tech, and the AirPods 4 continue that legacy. Released a little more than a year ago, this generation builds on what already worked while smoothing out some long-standing pain points. With current discounts bringing the price well below its original launch cost, the AirPods 4 now sit in a much more attractive position, especially for users already invested in Apple’s ecosystem.</p>
<p data-start="509" data-end="1189">The base model of the AirPods 4 debuted at $129, placing it firmly in the mid-range category for wireless earbuds. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6035/">A limited time deal at Amazon has lowered that figure by $29 at just $100.</a> For listeners who want more advanced features, Apple also offers a version with active noise cancellation. That model typically sells for $179, but current deals reduce the cost to $140, making the upgrade more approachable.</p>

<p data-start="1191" data-end="1822">From a design perspective, the AirPods 4 feel familiar at first glance, but closer inspection reveals several thoughtful changes. Apple refined the contour of the earbuds and shortened the stem, giving them a sleeker look and improving how they sit in the ear. The updated shape helps distribute weight more evenly, which contributes to better long-term comfort. Quick-press controls along the stem allow users to play, pause, or skip tracks with simple, reliable inputs.</p>
<h2 data-start="1191" data-end="1822">Improved Sound, In and Out</h2>
<p data-start="1824" data-end="2402">Under the hood, the AirPods 4 benefit from Apple’s H2 chip, which plays a major role in improving both call quality and audio performance. During phone calls or video chats, the chip enables advanced voice isolation that filters out background noise. This makes voices sound clearer and more natural, even in crowded or noisy environments. On the listening side, the H2 chip supports a new acoustic architecture that enhances overall sound quality. High frequencies come through with greater clarity, while bass feels deeper and more controlled compared to previous generations.</p>


<p data-start="2404" data-end="2697">The AirPods 4 also introduce new ways to interact with Siri. In addition to voice commands, users can now respond to certain prompts using simple head gestures, such as nodding or shaking their head. It’s a subtle feature, but it adds a layer of convenience when speaking out loud isn’t ideal.</p>
<p data-start="2699" data-end="3029">One of the most practical upgrades appears in the charging case. Apple has moved away from its proprietary Lightning connector in favor of USB-C. This change simplifies charging by allowing the same cable to be used across a wider range of devices, reducing clutter and making the AirPods easier to integrate into existing setups.</p>
<p data-start="2699" data-end="3029">With improved comfort, clearer calls, better sound, and a more convenient charging standard, the AirPods 4 offer a well-rounded experience. And now at as little as $100, they are hard to pass up.</p>
