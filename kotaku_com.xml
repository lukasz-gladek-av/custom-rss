              <p>We’re still a couple weeks shy of Black Friday and Cyber Monday. While you can expect to find lots of deals over that late-November weekend across consumer tech and pretty every every other category of products, that doesn’t mean you can’t find any lucrative deals right now. The Apple AirPods 4 are just over a year old and are now seeing a pretty significant discount. It’s a great time to pick up a pair if you’ve been holding out. The base model of Apple’s versatile earbuds released at the price of $129. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3769/">Right now, Amazon has them for 34% off, brining the price to just $85. You’ll end up saving yourself a good $44</a>. If you want to upgrade to the model with support for active noise cancellation, you can expect a 16% discount. That pair normally goes for $179, but the deal ends up shaving off $30 so you only have to pay $149 for a limited time.</p>
<p>AirPods have been around for a while now with Apple adding in some incremental improvements with each generation. The latest version in the Apple AirPods 4 feature a refined contour with a shorter stem and quick-press controls for music. Apple put a lot of focus on all-day comfort this time around.</p>

<h2>Isolate Sound</h2>
<p>You can expect better sound quality when it comes to calls all thanks to the new H2 chipset Apple designed. The new chip enables voice isolation to remove background noises. Folks on the other end of the call will be hearing you and only you, even if you’re in a crowded, noisy environment. The AirPods are able to eliminate sounds coming from around you so you come across perfectly clear.</p>
<p>Likewise, you can expect to better audio quality on your end because of the H2 chip. the new acoustic architecture is designed for crystal clear highs and deep bass.</p>



<p>A nice little addition to the AirPods feature set is how the buds interact with Apple’s voice assistant. Sire can now interpret basic gestures such as nodding yes or shaking your head no as a response to question. Not sure which seems weirder though for someone sitting across from you on the subway. You doing that, or you just blankly saying “Yes” or “No” allowed to no one in particular.</p>
<p>Something you can see different between the AirPods 4 and the previous model right away in a side-by-side is Apple has finally done away with the proprietary Lightning port. The case for the AirPods now charge using the now standard USB-C which is a welcome change indeed.</p>

              <p>Black Friday is just around the corner, and early discounts are already dropping in right, left, and center. Those looking to purchase a new laptop for work or entertainment – we’ve got good news.</p>
<p>The 17-inch HP touchscreen laptop, which normally retails for over $3,000, is now going for just $990 on Amazon. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5446/">That’s an unbelievable 73% discount, but there’s still more. You will also receive a free accessory kit worth almost $200 with your purchase.</a> Of course, like most big deals, this one is also around for a short time, so it’s best to act fast to grab it. We’re expecting the discount to wrap soon, and there’s no telling if it will be back for Black Friday or Cyber Monday.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5446/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>



<h2>Everything You Need to Get Started Right Away</h2>
<p>Starting off with the accessory kit; it includes Windows 11 Pro pre-installed, an external optical drive, a wireless mouse, and a cleaning cloth. These are all useful add-ons, but Windows 11 Pro steals the spotlight. This operating system is one of the best ones out there in terms of overall experience. Microsoft has packed it with a bunch of security features, productivity tools, and system management options, making it ideal for work professionals and creatives. It’s also more expensive than the Home version, but you don’t have to worry about that here.</p>
<p>As for the laptop itself, you’re getting a massive 17.3-inch HD+ (1600×900) anti-glare touchscreen that delivers clear, vibrant visuals. Colors will pop while staying easy on the eyes. Touch support makes it easy to scroll, pinch, swipe, and type directly on the screen using your fingertips. You can use it to sketch and even take notes when you’re not feeling like using the keyboard.</p>



<p>There’s also an HP True Vision 720p camera with a physical privacy shutter paired with AI Noise Reduction for better video calls. The battery offers up to 9 hours of video playback, meaning you can go a full day without plugging the laptop in. And when you do need to recharge, it goes from 0 to 50% in just 45 minutes!</p>
<p>Powering the device is an <strong>AMD Ryzen 5 7430U 6-core processor with 32GB RAM</strong> for faster and more efficient multitasking. The <strong>2TB SSD</strong> lets you store all your important documents, media content, and programs with ease. Together, these are enough to help you be productive on your busy days where you need to work with multiple applications at the same time, take back-to-back video calls, create presentations, etc.</p>
<p>We highly recommend grabbing the deal as soon as you can, before the retailer pushes the price up for good.</p>
