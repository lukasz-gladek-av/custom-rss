              <p>LEGO has just revealed its advent calendars for the 2025 holiday season. Every year, these calendars fly off shelves thanks to popular licenses like Star Wars, Harry Potter and Minecraft. But the runaway favorite, and once again for 2025, is the <strong>LEGO City Advent calendar</strong>. What’s catching everyone’s attention right now is that it’s the <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4349/">only one available at a 30% discount on Amazon for its launch, priced at $25 instead of the usual $35</a>. However, this deal won’t last long—the closer we get to the advent season, the faster these discounts will disappear.</p>

<h2>Our Favorite Advent Calendar</h2>
<p>This advent calendar offers a countdown to the holiday season <strong>with 24 sweet treats for kids aged 5 and above</strong>. Behind each door, little builders can find adorable mini-figures like <strong>Santa and Mrs. Claus</strong>, characters dressed in cozy outfits like polar bears and reindeer and numerous mini builds to spark imagination and holiday stories.</p>
<p>One of the cool features is the included Christmas party playmat that folds out to create a cozy winter ambiance for the mini-figures and buildings to be constructed. Each surprise has simple building instructions printed right within its window, created in special consideration for young LEGO fans.</p>



<p><strong>With 186 pieces in total</strong>, the LEGO City Advent calendar becomes a fun winter holiday party by the end of the month. Holiday accessories and mini builds encourage imaginative playtime – children can make up their own adventures or mix and match with other LEGO City series for endless fun after December. And it’s an exciting gift that girls and boys alike will enjoy, so it’s perfect for any building enthusiast child who loves holiday fun.</p>
<p>For $25, a 30% discount from the original $35 price, the LEGO City Advent calendar is an amazing deal. This is <strong>not usually done at launch on Amazon</strong> so it’s a fantastic opportunity to obtain this well-liked set ahead of time. Parents and gift buyers rave about this deal because it combines quality, fun and value without taking anything away</p>
