              <p>Last year, Moon Studios boss Thomas Mahler was threatening that his company <a href="https://kotaku.com/ori-moon-studios-no-rest-for-the-wicked-review-mahler-1851780166">might have to shut down</a> if players didn’t stop review-bombing his new action-RPG&nbsp;<em>No Rest for the Wicked</em> on Steam. Now his team is celebrating a major turnaround after a recent update brought multiplayer co-op to the top-down Soulslike. With a fresh spotlight on the Early Access project, Mahler took the opportunity to confirm that while the game is currently steeply discounted, it’ll cost as much as<em> Baldur’s Gate 3</em> once it’s fully released.</p> <p>“I’m not trying to do any FOMO marketing here, but yes: when we hit 1.0, <em>No Rest for the Wicked</em> will move to <span>$60</span>, because it’s a premium title,” he <a href="https://x.com/thomasmahler/status/2016906516754808905">wrote on X</a> on Thursday. “We’ve announced this a long time ago and repeated it several times.” He compared it to the hit <em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons</em>-based CRPG which remained full-price throughout Early Access. Unlike that, <em>No Rest for the Wicked</em> is typically $40 in its own Early Access period. At the moment, it’s even cheaper than that thanks to an ongoing Steam Sale. It’ll be 40 percent off until February 5.</p>

 <p>“The reason the game launched at <span>$40</span> was simple: <span>Early Access players should get a discount</span>,” Mahler wrote. “<em>BG3</em> launched into Early Access at full price, and personally I never loved that approach. If you support a game early, you should get some extra love. I’m only saying this now so nobody’s surprised or upset later. If you’ve been on the fence about <em>Wicked</em>, the current sale is genuinely a good time to jump in.”</p> <h2>A free-to-play Steam weekend coup</h2> <p>And a bunch of players clearly have been. <a tabindex="0" role="button" href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1371980/view/518610613985871419"><em>No Rest for the Wicked</em>‘s Together update</a> went live just last week on January 22. In addition to the usual bevy of quality-of-life improvements, bug fixes, and re-balancing, it brought full, shared-world co-op to the game that transformed the otherwise grim and solemn affair into something much more social. In addition to fighting through a brutal and bloody fantasy setting together, players can also fish, forage, and partake in other, more chill distractions.</p>

 <p>New players have been flocking to the game ever since with an major influx of positive Steam reviews over the weekend when the game was briefly free-to-play. It peaked at over 60,000 concurrents and was temporarily the best-selling game on Steam. Mahler said the game’s been selling tens of thousands of new copies every day since.</p>

 <p>It’s a far cry from last summer’s ominous warnings that the <em><a href="https://kotaku.com/ori-blind-forest-will-wisps-sexism-toxic-moon-studios-m-1848673622">Ori and the Blind Forest</a></em> maker might not be “around in a couple of months to do anything anymore” if existing players kept complaining about the direction of the game. The game is currently slated to arrive on PlayStation 5 when it hits 1.0, but so far there’s no set timeline for when that will happen.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Save Kittens And Blast Away Demons In This New $15 FPS]]></title>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>There are many, many, <em>many</em> retro-themed first-person shooters, aka <a href="https://kotaku.com/cruel-boomer-shooter-retro-fps-pc-steam-2025-review-1851737479">boomer shooters</a>, on the market. Some might say there are too many. I’m inclined to agree with that, if only because there’s a lot of crap and slop out there pretending to be solid throwbacks to fast-paced FPS action. <em>MeowGun: Hell Denizen, </em>out now on Steam, isn’t one of those disappointing games.</p> <p><em>MeowGun’</em>s biggest strength is that, like some other <a href="https://kotaku.com/dark-souls-morrowind-doom-engine-mohtra-review-pc-steam-fps-boomer-shooter-2000647667">great retro shooters</a> <a href="https://kotaku.com/wrath-is-a-retro-shooter-done-right-1841067258">including <em>Wrath</em></a>, it is built using an open-source version of a classic FPS engine. In this case, <em>MeowGun</em> uses FTEQW, which is an excellent open-source version of the original <em>Quake</em> engine. And as is usually the case with these boomer shooters built on the tech of the past, it helps make <em>MeowGun</em> feel fantastic.</p>

  <p>Every gun in <em>MeowGun</em> is snappy, loud, and deadly. You move fast, but always feel in control. And blowing away demons with pistols, shotguns, bombs, and grenade launchers is a joy. It helps that <em>MeowGun’s</em> developers understand that people play boomer shooters to blow shit up and kill lots of enemies while sprinting through various levels that should never be too big. I also appreciate that <em>MeowGun’s</em> starting pistol is quite powerful and proves useful in fights for picking off enemies or saving ammo. This ain’t a peashooter you’ll never use after you get a new weapon.</p> <p><em>MeowGun’s</em> voice acting is at times distracting, especially as the main character–a half cat/half demon woman named MeowMeow–speaks almost entirely in movie quotes and pop culture references. And they start to repeat pretty quickly. Thankfully, I was often blowing up so much shit that I rarely could hear these lines. But if a talking protagonist is too much for you, <em>MeowGun</em> might be a grating experience. On the other hand, if you love cats, there are small and very adorable kittens to find and save. Yes, before you ask, you can pet the cats you save. Oh, and there’s a dedicated button to make your character meow. I’ll let you decide how that makes you feel.</p>

 <p>To be clear: <em>MeowGun: Hell Denizen</em> isn’t some revolutionary first-person shooter that I’m going to come back to year after year to enjoy. But it is a damn good retro FPS that understands what people want out of these kinds of games: Lots of enemies to kill, fast music, satisfying guns, and short load times. And <em>MeowGun</em> delivers on all of that and costs less than $15. In 2026, I can’t ask for much more.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Google’s New AI Tool Had No Problem Making Bad Rip-Offs Of Mario And Zelda]]></title>

              <p><span>Google has just started rolling out access to its new “experimental research prototype” Project Genie, an AI tool powered by Genie 3 and Gemini that allows users to create interactive, explorable worlds with a simple text prompt. Unsurprisingly, someone has immediately used it to generate a bunch of playable Nintendo knock-offs, including a </span><i><span>The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild </span></i><span>clone, complete with a usable paraglider. I’m sure that the famously non-litigious Nintendo will be absolutely chill about this.</span></p> <p><span>This news comes by way of </span><a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/869726/google-ai-project-genie-3-world-model-hands-on?view_token=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiJ9.eyJpZCI6ImZCakl0bmxFNGwiLCJwIjoiL25ld3MvODY5NzI2L2dvb2dsZS1haS1wcm9qZWN0LWdlbmllLTMtd29ybGQtbW9kZWwtaGFuZHMtb24iLCJleHAiOjE3NzAxNDAwNTYsImlhdCI6MTc2OTcwODA1OH0.q5OBTD_V36-65oc1EGqPxKYCZF00c7ODvifvagVcwbA&amp;utm_medium=gift-link"><i><span>The Verge’s</span></i></a><span> Jay Peters, who was granted access to Google’s Project Genie tool early, ahead of its official release for Google AI Ultra subscribers in the United States earlier this afternoon. Peters was able to craft playable reproductions of several famous Nintendo titles, including </span><i><span>Super Mario 64</span></i><span> and the aforementioned </span><i><span>The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild</span></i><span>, as well as generating some odd amalgamation of </span><i><span>Metroid Prime 3</span></i><span> and </span><i><span>Metroid Prime 4</span></i><span>.</span></p>    <p><span>While it might not be immediately apparent in the videos that Peters provided, these Project Genie AI-generations are partially interactive, allowing users to move, jump, and, in the case of that </span><i><span>Breath of the Wild</span></i><span> one, even paraglide. For the time being, the worlds that it generates are limited to minute-long, 24fps, 720p showcases.</span></p>

 <p><span>So, how is this legal? The short answer is that it isn’t, and Project Genie knows it isn’t.</span></p> <p><span>At one point during his testing, Project Genie stopped Peters from making any further </span><i><span>Super Mario 64</span></i><span> reproductions, out of concern for the “interests of third-party content providers.”</span></p> <p><span>He also came dangerously close to generating a playable version of </span><i><span>Kingdom Hearts</span></i><span>. Project Genie generated an AI-generated mock-up featuring Donald Duck, Sora, Cloud, and Jack Skellington before the process was cut off at the world generation stage. I would have absolutely loved to have seen the resulting AI platform vs. AI platform legal battle that may have spawned out of that, considering </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/disney-open-ai-sora-deal-star-wars-frozen-2000652583"><span>Disney signed a $1 billion deal</span></a><span> to license its characters to OpenAI’s genAI platform.</span></p>
