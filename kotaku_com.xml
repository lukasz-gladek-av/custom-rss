<p>Another game worth checking out is this year’s&nbsp;<em>Marvel’s Deadpool VR</em>. This title puts your inside the head of everyone’s favorite merc with a mouth—shredding through enemies, guns a blazing—all while you get to enjoy the voiceover provided by none other than Neil Patrick Harris. This one is not part of the Meta Quest+ subscription package, but may still be worth dipping into as it’s the biggest VR release of 2025.</p>



<p data-start="2185" data-end="2651">The Meta Quest 3S is an impressive upgrade from its predecessor, the Meta Quest 2. It’s powered by the Snapdragon XR2 Gen 2 chipset, which delivers faster performance for smoother gameplay. The addition of outside sensors allows for full-color passthrough, letting you see the real world around you while using the headset. A new action button makes it easy to toggle between virtual reality and mixed reality.</p>
<p data-start="2653" data-end="2899" data-is-last-node="" data-is-only-node=""><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6531/">With current discounts offering up to $50 off, now is the perfect time to grab the Meta Quest 3S</a>. The 128GB model is available for just $250, while the 256GB model is down to $350, making it a great deal for anyone looking to jump into VR gaming.</p>
