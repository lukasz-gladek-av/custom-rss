              <p>A quick word-association exercise will usually produce the word “Bose” when the question is “luxury headphones.” In terms of performance and especially active noise cancellation, that’s absolutely true. But in terms of price, even Bose’s newest models are more accessible than you might think, and never more accessible than right now <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6718/">thanks to this $50-off Amazon deal on the QuietComfort Ultra 2 wireless headphones</a>.</p>
<p data-start="690" data-end="1017">The QC Ultra 2s dropped just this past October at $450, but lately Amazon and other retailers have quietly slashed the price deep into deal hunter territory. That means this $400 Amazon deal represents savings on months-old Bose headphones that would make even the most hardened tech shopper blink and the most devoted audiophile reach for their wallet.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6718/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2 data-start="690" data-end="1017">Serious Sound, Serious Deal</h2>
<p data-start="1019" data-end="1366">Here’s the wild part: Despite its premium positioning and outstanding , this deal pushes the QC Ultra 2s <em data-start="1101" data-end="1108">below</em> the cost of some older Bose QuietComfort models (yeah, the ones that aren’t even “Ultra”). So if you were on the fence about spending bigger on flagship-level noise cancellation, this Amazon deal makes the argument a whole lot easier.</p>
<p data-start="1019" data-end="1366">Bose took their stellar original QuietComfort Ultra headphones and made several significant upgrades to create the QuietComfort Ultra 2s. This latest model delivers Bose’s very best adaptive noise cancellation performance, with AI-based background noise suppression and Wind Block tech for listening in windy conditions. Bose added two new sound modes – Immersion and Cinema — along with support for wired lossless listening via audio or USB-C cables. The Cinema mode is a high-performing spatial setting which balances the overall audio in favor of dialogue, ideal for streaming and podcasts.</p>


<h2 data-start="1019" data-end="1366">Truly Premium</h2>
<p data-start="1019" data-end="1366">Even the physical look of the Bose QuietComfort Ultra 2 headphones is a step up from the originals, with more premium materials, polished metal yokes, and an overall sleeker and more modern look. The over-ear comfort level of the Ultra 2s is a step up from the already-pleasing original Ultras, and the battery life has been upgraded from 24 hours to 30. But it’s the active noise cancellation that Bose really leans into, and if you’re still recovering from holiday travel that involved overcrowded planes or trains stuffed with noisy commuters, you know the real value of a pair of world-class noise-cancelling headphones.</p>
<p data-start="1019" data-end="1366">Bose’s QuietComfort Ultra 2 wireless headphones pair easily with any Bluetooth device — Apple, Google, Android, and any properly equipped smart TV, for starters — and the Bluetooth Core 5.4 connection is strong and steady. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6718/">This somewhat unexpected Amazon sale bringing the QC Ultra 2 headphones down to $400 so soon after their release is the best way for you to experience true Bose sound without breaking the bank.</a></p>

            <title><![CDATA[Peak Dev Explains The Completely Bonkers Psychology Behind Game Prices]]></title>
            <link>https://kotaku.com/game-pricing-indie-steam-peak-content-warning-2000658886</link>
            <guid>1403395</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Game pricing is more all over the place than it’s ever been as developers explore the top and low ends of the spectrum, as well as everywhere in-between. And that’s before seasonal sales, subscription services, and monthly giveaways. Indie games in particular used to have to fight to prove they were worth the price of admission in the eyes of gamers used to big blockbuster spectacles produced on AAA budgets. But the psychology underlying those perceptions isn’t as clearcut as some might think, according to one of the developers of 2025’s <a href="https://kotaku.com/peak-steam-reviews-lethal-company-aggro-crab-1851786254">top-selling “friendslop” climbing sim <em>Peak</em></a>.</p> <p>The game <a href="https://kotaku.com/peak-steam-reviews-lethal-company-aggro-crab-1851786254">launched last June</a> at a discounted sale price of $5. That was $3 below what would be it’s “normal” price of $8. Co-creator Nick Kaman recently explained the logic behind the maneuver <a href="https://www.gamefile.news/p/peak-interview">to <em>Game File</em></a>. “We had this joke of, like, how much is a game really?” he said. “In a player’s mind, what does it mean to spend five bucks? Well, that’s five bucks. But six bucks? Well, that’s still five bucks. Four bucks is also kind of five bucks.”</p>

 <p>He continued, “Three bucks is two bucks. And two bucks is basically free. So we’ve got these tiers: You know, twelve bucks… that’s ten bucks. But thirteen bucks is fifteen bucks. And we found that eight bucks is still five bucks. It doesn’t become ten bucks. Seven ninety nine, that’s five bucks, right? So, eight bucks going to five bucks is the biggest differential we could find in pricing, so we found it very optimal.”</p>   <p>The developers of<em> Peak</em> didn’t randomly pick $8 out of a hat. That was the <a href="https://kotaku.com/content-warning-impressions-1851407637">price of <em>Content Warning</em></a>, another hit in the multiplayer virality sim genre. But the overall logic lines up with something game designer and Suspicious Developments studio founder Tom Francis recently wrote about indie game pricing. His take was <a href="https://www.pentadact.com/2026-01-08-15-years-of-indie-dev-in-4-bits-of-advice/#price">part of a four-point advice guide</a> for new developers based on his 15 years of experience making games like <a href="https://kotaku.com/heat-signature-is-a-thrilling-game-about-spaceship-heis-1818625899"><em>Heat Signature</em></a> and <a href="https://kotaku.com/tactical-breach-wizards-impressions-strategy-steam-1851626007"><em>Tactical Breach Wizards</em></a>.</p>

 <h2>Steam indie game pricing is a “solved problem”</h2> <p>According to Francis, game sales are a function of three things: 1) how many people come to the Steam Page, 2) how much the Steam page makes them want to buy it, and 3) how much it costs. “We just ask people how much they think the game should cost, and every time we’ve gone with the price most people chose, and every time they’ve sold great and reviewed great,” he explained.</p>

 <p>He pushed back against the older conventional wisdom that meeting player expectations rather than setting them would lead indie game prices in a race to the bottom. “Among the many genres and models that didn’t exist back then is the occasional janky/silly/ugly game charging $5 to encourage a kind of ‘fuck it, why not’ good will, and blowing up if it lands right with streamers,” he wrote. “That might bring the median price down, but it’s not a sign that people will no longer pay $20 for an indie game.”</p>

 <p>You can see this philosophy in action with the recent release of <em>Rising Front</em>, a pretty ugly-looking, very rudimentary WWI and Revolutionary War battle sim FPS (complimentary). Its 1.0 launch on Steam on January 9 was accompanied by an influx of fairly positive reviews. It’s normally priced at $15 but is currently on sale for just $12. According to Kaman, that’s actually $10. Maybe after reading the <em>Peak</em> developer’s comments, <em>Rising Front</em>‘s creators will lower it to $8.</p>
