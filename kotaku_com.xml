              <p>It would be hard to blame Nintendo for becoming used to getting its way when it comes to courts. In case after case, <a href="https://kotaku.com/nintendo-switch-piracy-reddit-mod-archbox-million-2000631966">the Japanese behemoth crushes its prey</a>, scoring millions in damages. But when it comes to the increasingly complex attempt to take down the enormous success of creature-collecting survival game&nbsp;<em>Palworld</em>, Nintendo has just taken a big blow, being denied a vital patent.</p> <p>In one of the more peculiar twists of the lengthy battle between <em>Pokémon</em> owners Nintendo and&nbsp;<em>Palworld</em> creators Pocketpair, Nintendo submitted a few new or revised patents to the courts to attempt to retrospectively claim rights to specific gaming mechanics. While some might very sensibly consider the idea of a gaming mechanic being something someone could patent as anathema to all of art and creativity, and to be rank hypocrisy in an industry that’s entirely built on top of mechanics created by previous generations, it’s still somehow a thing. And a thing Nintendo was rather heavily relying on in its court case against <em>Palworld.</em></p>

 <p>When&nbsp;<a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-palworld-ai-art-copyright-law-pocketpair-1851186580?_gl=1*21id2z*_ga*MTk4MjkyODk2OS4xNzExNTYxOTM0*_ga_V4QNJTT5L0*MTcyNjcwMzk2My4xODguMS4xNzI2NzA0MDI1LjYwLjAuMA.."><em>Palworld</em> first appeared in January 2024</a>, pretty much everyone’s reaction was to laugh at the absolutely blatant copies of very familiar Pokémon that appeared in the game. It seems Nintendo wanted to take action, but suing over pastiches of their characters is a tricky business, so eight months later <a href="https://kotaku.com/nintendo-pokemon-palworld-lawsuit-pocketpair-patent-1851654149">the company instead opted for going after&nbsp;<em>Palworld</em>‘s creature-capturing mechanics</a>—throwing an orb that then captures the animal—that are most familiar from <em>Pokémon</em> games.</p>

 <p>And it only got weirder. <a href="https://kotaku.com/nintendo-pokemon-palworld-patents-lawsuit-pocketpair-1851692965">When we finally got the details of the lawsuit in November of last year</a>, it became apparent that Nintendo and The Pokémon Company were suing for less than $70,000, and the basis for its case were all patents the company had filed in that year,&nbsp;after&nbsp;<em>Palworld</em> had been released. Three patents were cited, the first based on throwing a Poké Ball to start combat, the second a tweak of an older patent to update it to capturing Pokémon in the wild, and the third the most extraordinary, a claim to rights for a simple transition onto rideable creatures in open worlds.</p>

 <h2>Who hunts the monster hunters?</h2> <p>Jump to today, and it seems this tactic isn’t entirely panning out. <a href="https://gamesfray.com/japan-patent-office-rejects-nintendo-application-relevant-to-palworld-dispute-cites-games-like-ark-as-prior-art-after-third-party-submission/"><em>Games Fray</em></a> noticed that the Japanese Patent Office has suggested two of these three patents are pretty dubious. The issue, it seems, is Nintendo’s attempt to update its former patents to include the more open-world elements of <em>Pokémon&nbsp;</em>games since 2022, despite the wealth of prior examples of such mechanics appearing far earlier in other open-world titles. According to&nbsp;<em>Games Fray</em>, the patent office cited examples like <em>Monster Hunter 4</em>,&nbsp;<em>ARK</em>, and even Pocketpair’s own&nbsp;<em>Craftopia</em>. Oh, and to really stick it home,&nbsp;<em>Pokémon GO</em>.</p>

 <p>Now Nintendo has to decide between abandoning this specific route in the increasingly ridiculous legal action (never forget that while&nbsp;<em>Palworld</em> was absolutely mimicking Pokémon designs, it just simply isn’t a similar type of game, instead focused on survival and crafting), or petitioning the patent office to accept its case.</p> <p>It’s just…the case is gross. Developers shouldn’t be able to patent mechanics, and had it ever been a common part of games design, we simply wouldn’t have video games. Everything you play is built on the shoulders of what came before.&nbsp;<em>Donkey Kong</em> may have an argument to be the first ever platform game, but it doesn’t exist without&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crazy_Climber"><em>Crazy Climber</em></a> and&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_Panic"><em>Space Panic</em></a>. Pocketpair deliberately provoked Nintendo, and Nintendo foolishly fell for it, and the result is years of expensive litigation for no meaningful results.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><span>This morning, Nintendo casually announced that </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/animal-crossing-new-horizons-switch-2-edition-update-free-2000640118"><i><span>Animal Crossing: New Horizons</span></i><span> is getting a Switch 2 update</span></a><span> to make it run better and use some of the device’s more powerful tech for quality-of-life improvements. Alongside this, Nintendo is also releasing a 3.0 update that includes new features, crossover items, and a whole new creator mode that exists in your character’s dreams. This is the first major update </span><i><span>New Horizons </span></i><span>has received since 2021, and at a certain point, you kind of accept that a game is probably no longer a developer’s priority and they’ve likely shifted their attention elsewhere. So the reveal that a huge update is coming has reawakened the </span><i><span>Animal Crossing </span></i><span>community like a sleeper agent, and they’re in a state of disbelief.</span></p> <figure id="attachment_2000640149" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000640149"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000640149">© YouTube / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p><span>The Switch 2 upgrade and the 3.0 update are bringing some surprising changes to </span><i><span>New Horizons</span></i><span>, including crossover items from </span><i><span>The Legend of Zelda</span></i><span> and </span><i><span>Splatoon</span></i><span>, as well as general Nintendo memorabilia, and, oddly enough, a bunch of Lego furniture pieces. Some </span><i><span>Zelda </span></i><span>characters will even appear as villagers in the new update, which raises questions about whether or not </span><i><span>Animal Crossing</span></i><span> takes place in the </span><i><span>Smash Bros. </span></i><span>multiverse.

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/govee-smart-led-ceiling-light-is-going-for-peanuts-already-selling-out-fast-after-the-price-drop.1339297/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>You don’t have to change the entire wiring in your home just to improve the lighting situation. A simple ceiling fixture swap can do the job too, and it costs way less than a full-blown lighting overhaul. Even better, we just spotted an already-affordable smart ceiling light going for way less on Amazon.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5108/">The retailer has dropped the price of the Govee Smart RGBIC LED ceiling light to just $50, thanks to a $30 discount on its usual $80 tag</a>. It doesn’t require any complex installations and elevates the vibe of your entire space in no time. The deal is available to both Prime and non-Prime members, but there’s no telling how long it will last. If you’ve been wanting to get that ambiance boost without spending a ton, now is the time to act.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5108/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>16 Million Color Options; Something for Every Mood</h2>
<p>This smart ceiling light comes with two lights; the main light, which uses an RGB+WW configuration, and the backlight featuring RGBIC technology. You get 16 million color options and 71 scene modes to choose from using the Govee Home app. Color temperature ranges from 2200K to 6500K, so it’s easy to go from a warm, soothing light to a brighter one within seconds.</p>
<p>The brightness is also adjustable. You can pick a setting anywhere between 1% and 100%, with a maximum output of 2400 lumens. Want to wind down after a long day? Go for a gentle, warm light that makes it easier to relax. Need to focus on a task? A brighter white light should work well. And if you have other Govee lights at home, you can use the Govee Home App to sync the two together for a bigger, more fun setup.</p>



<p>Speaking of the app, it’s quite easy to use and offers a wide range of customization options to play with. You can control lights, create schedules, and even set timers. The ceiling light also works well with Alexa and Google Assistant, so you can also use your voice to control the setup. Installation is simple and should only take a few minutes, even if it’s your first time setting up a wired ceiling light.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5108/">All things considered, this deal offers a great chance to upgrade the vibe of your space for less.</a> This ceiling light is now down to just $50, but won’t be for long. Get your orders in before it’s too late.</p>

              <p>Now is a great time for a laptop upgrade. Even though Black Friday and Cyber Monday are still weeks away, Amazon has already started rolling out some hard-to-miss tech deals, but it’s not always easy to spot the ones that are truly worth it. That’s where we come in, and we just found an incredible offer for those finally ready to say goodbye to their old, noisy machine.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5107/">Right now on Amazon, the 17.3-inch HP 2025 laptop is down to $800, after a huge $2,500 drop in its retail price</a>. This version sits between the entry-level and high-end configurations of the same model, and is appropriate for everyday work and play. Even better, you’re getting free accessories with your purchase, too! You can rely on this machine for your office tasks, creative projects, streaming, and even light gaming. The deal, however, is a limited-time one, and there’s no telling how long it’ll stick around. So if this one checks your boxes, it’s smart to grab it while it’s still live.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5107/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Windows 11 Pro Ready to Go</h2>
<p>This laptop runs on Windows 11 Pro, which comes pre-installed. You’re getting Intel’s 10-core i5-1334U processor, which ramps up to 4.6GHz, so it’s got plenty of power for resource-intensive tasks. Those who often need to work with different applications at once will appreciate the 32GB of RAM that actively prevents lag, plus a 1TB SSD, which makes for faster boot times. You can easily jump between a ton of tabs and programs without slowdown, while also keeping all your important files in a single place.</p>
<p>The display is also bigger than the standard options out there. You will enjoy impressive visuals on the large 17.3-inch HD+ BrightView display that’s suited for both indoor and outdoor use. Expect vivid, vibrant colors and impressive detail, regardless of what’s playing. There’s also an HP TrueVision 720p HD camera with a privacy shutter paired with dual microphones for clearer video calls.</p>



<p>Connectivity options include Wi-Fi 6 and Bluetooth 5.3, alongside a wide range of ports to connect your essentials. The freebies include the pre-installed Windows 11 Pro we mentioned above, plus an external CD/DVD drive, a portable hard drive, a wireless mouse, a cleaning cloth, dust plugs, and a webcam privacy cover. Basically, there’s no need to buy anything extra to get started.</p>
<p>Snag the discount before it vanishes for good!</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/arc-raiders-players-blasted-with-lost-server-connections-as-it-surges-to-over-160-000-concurrent-players.1339216/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/arc-raiders-pvpve-extraction-maps-embark-studios-2000639945"><em>Arc Raiders</em> launches today</a> across PC and console and it’s already tearing up the charts on Steam. The influx of players means some are experiencing day-one server issues, even as the extraction shooter is propelled into the Valve-owned storefront’s top-10 most-played games.</p> <p>Despite being $40, Embark Studios’ latest PVPVE game is already climbing past free-to-play games like <em>Naraka: Bladepoint</em>&nbsp;and <em>Apex Legends</em>. It’s currently ranked seventh overall with over <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/charts/mostplayed">160,000 concurrent players</a> and remains the best-selling game across all of Steam at the moment. Not bad for a Thursday release when most people are still at work or in school.</p>

 <p>But the initial flood of players did bring with it some early server problems. Some players got kicked from the game with a screen that read “<a href="https://twitter.com/kelskiYT/status/1983830108210426328?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1983830108210426328%7Ctwgr%5E49b2d22e0e8daecd8b18ce1cd77d1d94e3502fbc%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.eurogamer.net%2Farc-raiders-online-connection-error-launch-server-problem">online connection error</a>” while others faced a problem called “<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ArcRaiders/comments/1ojwo7x/what_does_this_mean_is_it_my_wifi_or_is_it_the/#lightbox">network timeout</a>” in which the game said it had failed to retrieve their data from the backend services. Fortunately, it doesn’t sound like these issues were super widespread and they appear to be resolving as we get further from when <em>Arc Raiders</em> first went live earlier today.</p>

   <p>The pitch for <em>Arc Raiders</em> is straightforward enough. You play as a fighter scavenging through a post-apocalyptic world that feels trapped in the surreal analog years of the late ’70s, early ’80s in the best way. You collect loot, battle other players, and try to take down powerful computer-controlled machines called Arcs. It’s from Embark Studios, which also shipped <em>The Finals</em>, and shows potential for helping the extraction shooter genre break out beyond the notoriously hardcore communities that usually play them.</p>

 <p>It’s currently sitting at a rating of over 80 percent positive on Steam with 1,000 reviews in so far. “I didn’t know bots could hold grudges, but apparently Embark Studios wrote the AI like, ‘If player breathes, hunt player,'” wrote one early player. “Each encounter feels alive, unpredictable, and truly earned,” another wrote. A third was more succinct: “Pew, pew, pew.”</p>

 <p>But not everyone’s buzzing. There have been calls for less emphasis on paid cosmetics and the addition of a solo mode. Some players have also called for a PVE-only option, speculating that the launch would be that much bigger if <em>Arc Raiders</em> had gone the <em>Helldivers 2</em> route. “<a href="https://steamcommunity.com/app/1808500/discussions/0/811335793676561765/">PvE Isn’t a Threat, Karen – It’s Just Another Way to Play</a>,” reads one of the most active threads on the Steam Discussion page. Some hardcore fans don’t want the option “diluting” the experience. Others think the extraction shooter could be one of the biggest games of the year with it.</p>

 <h2>Is there AI slop in <em>Arc Raiders</em>?</h2> <p>You might have noticed an generative AI warning on the<em> Arc Raiders</em> Steam page. “During the development process, we may use procedural- and AI-based tools to assist with content creation,” it reads. “In all such cases, the final product reflects the creativity and expression of our own development team.” Embark’s previous game also used generative AI for its in-match announcer commentary.</p>

 <p>“<em>Arc Raiders</em> in no way uses generative AI whatsoever,” design director Virgil Watkins claimed during a new interview <a href="https://www.pcgamesn.com/arc-raiders/generative-ai-use">with <em>PCGamesN</em></a>. “We use something called machine learning, or reinforcement learning, and that’s to do with the locomotion for our larger drones with multiple legs, but there’s no generative content whatsoever.”</p> <p>Studio boss Patrick Soderlund elaborated on that process in a different interview with <a href="https://www.thegamebusiness.com/p/arc-raiders-the-game-that-dares-to"><em>The Game Business</em> this week</a>. “If you ask for [development that’s] 100 times faster, you have to take what you know and basically throw that away and then start really thinking about what type of modifications and transformation do we need to go through in order to completely change the way that we approach this,” he said. “So that’s when we came into procedurally generated content, to using AI and machine learning to some extent in even the content creation pipelines, to what types of tools we build, and realizing that a lot of these tools that we’ve been working with for so long stem from software that’s 25 to 30 years old.”</p> <p>While <em>Arc Raiders</em> also uses the text-to-speech AI for voicing certain character lines, it doesn’t sound like the visuals or any other objects directly visible in the game were made with generative AI tools. Whether the development team’s assurances get your slop senses tingling is another question entirely.</p>

              <p>Even people who&nbsp;<em>really</em> love the holidays will admit that scaling a ladder to hang festive holiday lights, and then doing it all over again to take them down weeks later, is a massive pain. It’s not a stretch to say that people standing on rickety ladders in freezing weather have spent decades wishing for a solution.</p>
<p>It’s also not a stretch to say that Govee’s smart outdoor LED strip lights are that solution, because they’re weatherproof and completely customizable to fit every holiday and special event, and even just serve as accent lighting for your home. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5106/">Amazon has a limited-time deal taking 25% off the price of a 98.4-foot package of Govee smart outdoor LED lights, giving you the option to retire the rickety ladder forever for just $120</a>.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5106/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Every Holiday Covered</h2>
<p>You know the drill — Christmas lights are green and red, or all-white; Halloween lights are orange, and if you really go all-out with the festive decorating, green for St. Patrick’s Day, red for Valentine’s Day, and so on. That used to mean more or less constant installation and removal, but these Govee LED lights have virtually limitless color possibilities, and 64 vivid festive presets to cover every occasion. With the Govee Home app you can also design and save your own color schemes and effects, including ones where the lights dance in sync with music.</p>
<p>The Govee Home app is the key to complete control and customization of your outdoor lights, including timers, brightness, scenes, colors, and more via Wi-Fi. Voice control with Alexa, Google Home, and other smart home assistants is also easy to set up.</p>



<h2>Year-Round Decor</h2>
<p>The Govee LED light strips and control box are both rated IP65 for waterproofing, and the power adapter is rated IP44. The light strips are made of durable, transparent silicone, and they operate in temperatures ranging from 140 degrees Fahrenheit to minus-22, which means once you complete the easy installation of the three 32.8-foot LED strips with the included light clip sets, you can leave them up for good. And no, it’s not like the old lights where if one went dead, the entire strip gives up.</p>
<p>It might be on the late side to <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5106/">take this Amazon deal for 25% off and buy your Govee smart outdoor lights for just $120</a> in time to get them up for Halloween 2025, but they’ll look amazing for Christmas and every holiday or special occasion for years to come, and they’ll provide beautiful accent lighting anytime you want. You’re just one click away from making your last trip up that ladder.</p>
