Part of a $60 bundle that includes an open face dock so fans can play in TV mode without removing the case (<span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/06/psa-dbrands-switch-2-killswitch-dock-adapters-seamless-docking-apparently-isnt-quite-seamless&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/06/psa-dbrands-switch-2-killswitch-dock-adapters-seamless-docking-apparently-isnt-quite-seamless" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">which is also having some issues</a></span>), the main culprit are the plastic grips that hug the new Joy-Con. As Dbrand itself has explained following all of the customer complaints, there’s a small lip on the inside edge of the Joy-Con case that’s meant to keep it from easily sliding out. But that lip also fills in an air gap engineered into the Switch 2 between the screen and the Joy-Con to help with the magnetic locking mechanism.</p><p>Dbrand sent me the Killswitch case at launch and I’ve been testing it along with a bunch of other accessories. When I started to wonder why I never encountered this issue before, I realized it’s because I didn’t have my Joy-Con fully in their cases so the lip was never filling that air gap. The result was that the Joy-Con never popped out while I was holding the console. Instead, the problem I encountered was that the Joy-Con cases easily popped off if I moved my hands laterally at all. </p><p>Dbrand actually brings up that exact problem <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/dbrand/comments/1lhvtyw/killswitch_joycon_detachment_update/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/dbrand/comments/1lhvtyw/killswitch_joycon_detachment_update/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">in a long Reddit</a></span> post on June 22 defending the Killswitch case for the Switch 2. It mentions the sliding issue with a “different brand’s NS2 case,” which in this case is Genki’s Attack Vector.<strong>&nbsp;</strong>I’ve been testing that kit as well and have had that precise issue. So it’s a design challenge that’s not unique to Dbrand, but it’s also clear from the issues people are experiencing that it’s one Dbrand hasn’t adequately solved either yet.</p><p>After making sure my Joy-Con were firmly locked into my Killswitch case, I did some testing today and sure enough the Joy-Con kept popping out, leaving the rest of the console to plunge to its doom. Dbrand claims, in its defense, that this is only an issue for people holding their Switch 2 wrong. The company claims all three of the following criteria need to be met for the Killswitch case to fail:</p><blockquote data-type="BlockQuote"><ol data-type="List" data-style="Number"><li>You are specifically holding onto the console from only the Joy-Cons, in such a way that your fingers are making no supportive contact with the main console, <strong>and</strong></li><li>you are holding the Switch 2 with only one hand, <strong>and</strong></li><li>your Switch 2 is held more parallel to the ground than not.</li></ol></blockquote><p>The notoriously irreverent and abrasive accessory maker then went on to blame customers for user error, stating “nobody routinely holds their Switch 2 like this.” That set off a fresh firestorm in the subreddit of people showing that many have in fact held the Switch 2 like that, including YouTuber LinusTechTips and <em>Tonight Show</em> host Jimmy Fallon. Also my oldest kid, who walks into my home office flapping the Switch 2 by the Joy-Con with one hand  at least three times a week despite my constant threats to never let him play it again if he doesn’t stop.</p><p>Dbrand maintains that only a small number of the over 100,000 Killswitch cases it’s manufactured are exhibiting real problems. Its position is that while people who want to make their Switch 2 fall off while using the case can, most won’t experience that under normal usage. For those that do, Dbrand is changing the variance in size of the Joy-Con case lip to filter out overly big ones during the manufacturing process starting with July shipments. “For those that have received their order and are having issues that they believe fall within ‘regular use,’ we’re fucking sorry,” Dbrand wrote on Reddit. While the explanation makes sense, the tone and lack of accountability do not. <br></p><p>“People bought a case to protect damage for their expensive product but also expected to use it as the original console design intended, and there’s a point where [you] need to drop the act and start acting like adults, not children behind a keyboard,” <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/dbrand/comments/1ljb61g/as_someone_who_is_disabled_telling_me_im_holding/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/dbrand/comments/1ljb61g/as_someone_who_is_disabled_telling_me_im_holding/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">wrote</a></span> one person in response. “To see the company not only blame the consumer, but also refuse to retool their clearly defective product, and then have the gall to ask dissatisfied customers to not use the product and pay expensive return shipping rates to a completely different country in order to get a refund, erodes the trust Dbrand has gained from its community,” wrote another.</p><p>Implying that at least some of the people who bought the Killswitch case and then posted videos of the Joy-Con popping out on Reddit were disingenuous clout chasers was a bold strategy that doesn’t yet appear to be paying off. It’s easy to see the obstacles on Dbrand’s end. The Switch 2's magnetic connectors are a bespoke and precisely engineered solution to a design challenge by a different company. Designing around that is not easy task, especially if you’re racing to manufacture inventory for launch in the middle of a chaotic trade war without early access to the actual hardware in question. </p><p>But after testing the Killswitch off and on for a couple of weeks, I’m not convinced that it’s any more deserving of special considerations than other accessories, especially cheaper ones on offer from any number of generic copycat shops. The Killswitch doesn’t feel so good or so premium that it’s worth overlooking a key vulnerability. The rail locks for the Joy-Con on my older Switch OLED were treated so roughly over the years that one of the tiny screws fell out without me even noticing and it jiggles now. So for now I’d hold off on the Killswitch until the air-gap problem is fixed across the board. </p><p>What I can recommend is Dbrand’s screen protector. It’s hands-down the best on the market thanks to a specialty case that makes applying it perfectly with no bubbles or botched angles completely dummy proof. </p><p>.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://kotaku.com/switch-2-dbrand-killswitch-case-joy-con-magnets-instock-1851785019]]></content:encoded>

Of course, exploration helps, too. But that said, this is more than a simple player house. It’s a money-making machine for the right type of playstyle—specifically a thief or pirate-type—and with the appropriate upgrades, it even features a bonafide Fence, Spymaster, and a personal Fletcher for you stealth archer types out there.</p><p><strong>Read More:</strong> <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/oblivion-remastered-selling-stolen-goods-scaling-gates-1851781929&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/oblivion-remastered-selling-stolen-goods-scaling-gates-1851781929">Three Essential Things <em>Oblivion Remastered</em> Doesn’t Tell You</a></span></p><p>For now, let’s focus on finding the player house.<strong> It’s located southeast of Anvil. On the map, it appears as Dunbarrow Cave, but there’s a problem</strong>. The cave icon is on the wrong hill. <strong>If you follow the in-game map precisely, you’ll wind up in the wrong location.</strong> Instead, head to said location, then turn back toward the Anvil castle to the north. You’ll note a little cove between the castle and a rocky outcropping. There, beneath the castle walls, is a wooden door.</p><figure id="" data-id="5953330f772182d944b472d94aa7e94e" data-recommend-id="image://5953330f772182d944b472d94aa7e94e" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The entrance to the Thieves Den tucked into an alcove beneath Anvil Castle in Oblivion Remastered." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="The entrance to the Thieves Den tucked into an alcove beneath Anvil Castle in Oblivion Remastered." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Bethesda / Brandon Morgan / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="5953330f772182d944b472d94aa7e94e" data-recommend-id="image://5953330f772182d944b472d94aa7e94e" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The entrance to the Thieves Den tucked into an alcove beneath Anvil Castle in Oblivion Remastered." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>The cave beyond the door isn’t overly confusing or labyrinthian. Follow the lights until you find the door leading to Smuggler’s Cave. Inside, you’re greeted by an expansive cavern filled with little campsites and a broken pirate ship.
