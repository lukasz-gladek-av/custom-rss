              <p>We’re still a solid month away from the big holiday sales of the season. I’m of course talking about Black Friday and Cyber Monday. During this several day span following Thanksgiving, you’ll be able to find tons of deals on tech, home goods, and more. However, even though we’re not quite there yet, you can find some pretty steep discounts right now if you know where to look. At this moment, Amazon has its Wi-Fi 7 mesh router, the Eero Pro 7, on sale for about 20% off.</p>
<p>The router is available either on its own or in a pack of two or three. The standalone <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5196/">Eero Pro 7 mesh router typically sells for $300, but for a limited time, you can save $60 — bringing the price down to just $240</a>. Though the advantage of a mesh Wi-Fi router is using it to make a mesh Wi-Fi network, using more than one node. The Eero Pro 7 two-pack is normally set at $550, but has come down by $100 to just $450 during this sale. Likewise, the three-pack has dropped from $700 to just $550, making for a savings of $150.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5196/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<p>The Eero Pro 7 is Amazon’s flagship router for taking advantage of the speeds and range of Wi-Fi 7. Each router in your Eero network will be able to cover up to 2,000 square feet, or up to 6,000 square feet if you go with the set of three. Each node covers a 25-foot radius and supports over 200 networked devices each (600 total).</p>



<h2>Internet in Every Corner</h2>
<p>What’s great about a mesh network is you can expand it to your needs at any time. If you just start with the one, you can later on add any single Eero to extend your Wi-Fi coverage further. The Eero Pro 7 is backward compatible with all previous generations of Eero as well as Amazon Echo devices that have Eero capabilities built in. Having multiple Eero routers on your network can help to eliminate dead spots throughout your home, ensuring you can maintain a fast and stable connection wherever you are in your house.</p>



<p>With a Eero Pro 7, you can achieve fast upload and download speeds, supporting internet plans of up to 5 Gbps when using either of the two auto-sensing 5 GbE ports. Wireless connections can reach speeds of up to 3.9 Gbps.</p>
<p>You can choose on the item page an option that comes with one free month of Eero Plus. This subscription grans you a slew of online security, privacy, and parental controls. After that first month, the price becomes $9.99 when using auto-renew.</p>

              <p>Drone prices can really be all over the place, and that makes sense. If you’re just looking to have some fun in the park or your backyard, you can find a drone for under $50. They’re pretty much toys. For a few hundred, you can get a real hobbyist drone that gives you more range, durability, flight time, recording resolution, etc. Then there’s the professional tier, and that’s where this drone falls (or lands safely): The <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5195/">DJI Air 3S drone combo pack (including a RC2 remote controller and three batteries)&nbsp; normally goes for $2,499 but following a 20% discount, it comes down by an even $500</a>. That brings the drone down to just $1,999 for a limited time.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5195/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<p>This drone doesn’t just rely on you using your phone screen: It comes with its own <strong>dedicated controller featuring its own screen</strong> to view what your drone is seeing. The drone utilizes a dual-camera system which consists of a 1-inch CMOS 24mm 50MP wide angle camera along with a 1/1.3-inch CMOS 70mm 48MP medium telephoto camera. Between to tow of them, you can capture everything from beautiful, scenic landscapes to cinematic close-ups all from the skies. Video is capable of recording in up to 4K resolution at 60fps with HDR. You’re footage with be breathtaking.</p>
<p>The six-antenna array system is able to transmit the video down from the drone to your control panel, maintaining a live feed in 1080p at 60fps at up to a staggering 20 km away. The DJI Air 3S drone can keep up in the <strong>air for a long flight time of 45 minutes (and there are 3 batteries included)</strong>. That’s about a 48% increase over the previous model drone — the DJI Air 2S — so you can record stunning shots without worrying too much about battery life.</p>



<h2>Worry-Free Flying</h2>
<p>You can fly with confidence, staying in control, thanks to the drones omnidirectional obstacle sensing. The DJI Air 3S drone is able to intelligently navigate on its own back to it’s launch point passing through challenged environments like a tree-filled forest. Even if it’s dark outside, the forward-facing LiDAR can help maintain a clear path on its way back. Heck, even if access to GPS is lost, the drone memorizes it’s flight path so it can follow it back to its starting point without the need for GPS.</p>
<p>This bundle comes with a number of bonus gifts included with your DJI Air 3S drone. It comes with a 128GB microSD card, three flight batteries (allowing for up to 135 minutes total), a battery charging hub, a shoulder bag, photography backpack, three extra pairs of low-noise propellers, a gimbal protector, a cleaning kit, and even a drone landing pad</p>
