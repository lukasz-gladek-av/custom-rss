              <p>If your TV doesn’t offer built-in streaming options and you’re looking to cut the cord, a streamer can be a smart investment. Google’s 4K TV streamer is one of the best options out there, and you can now grab it without paying the full price at Amazon.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/7076/">It typically sits at $80, but you can now snap it up for $100 at the retailer, after a modest 20% drop.</a> The offer applies to both Haze and Porcelain models, so you can pick the one that suits your aesthetics the best. Just note that the offer is selling out fast (as you’d expect), so you don’t really have a lot of time left to save. Grab it before the price shoots back up!</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/7076/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Popular Streaming Platforms, Plus Live TV Channels</h2>
<p>This streamer sits neatly on your console and comes with a redesigned remote that makes it easy to navigate and access content. It supports voice commands, meaning you can also just speak to find shows, get answers, and control smart home devices.</p>
<p>You’ll enjoy a ton of movies and TV shows from all your services right from your home screen, plus get tailored recommendations based on your viewing habits. Popular streaming apps that come built right in include Netflix, Prime Video, Hulu, Disney+, Apple TV, and more. Note that most of these require a subscription. If you’re looking to cut back on those, the streamer also gets you live TV, with access to over 800 free channels from Pluto TV, Tubi, and more. What’s even better is that if you find an interesting show or movie on your TV, mobile app, or Google, you can quickly add it to your watchlist and stream when you’re ready in just a few clicks. Additionally, casting content from multiple compatible Android and iOS apps on your phone, tablet, or laptop right to your streamer is possible, too.</p>



<p>Then there’s support for 4K HDR and Dolby Vision, which lets you view both the classics and latest releases in great detail with true-to-life colors. You can also connect external speakers that can support Dolby Atmos for 3D sound. The result? An immersive viewing experience that pulls you into whatever’s playing on the screen.</p>
<p>As for performance, Google has packed the streamer with a 22% faster processor and twice the memory of the previous generation. This translates into smoother navigation and faster app switching. Those with smart home devices will also appreciate how this thing doubles as a hub, making it easy to get things done around the house more conveniently. This can include managing lights, checking camera feed, adjusting temperature, etc.</p>
<p>All in all, if you’ve been looking to stream your favorite shows and movies better, the 4K Google TV Streamer is a top option to consider. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/7076/">The current 20% discount makes upgrading a lot more affordable, but the offer won’t be around for long</a>. It’s best to place your orders while the discount is still live to avoid last-minute disappointments!</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/oakley-meta-hstn-hits-an-all-time-low-while-ray-ban-smart-ai-glasses-remain-at-full-price-2000666153</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>If smart sunglasses have been sitting on your tech wish list, this might be the moment to finally make the jump. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/7075/">Amazon is currently offering the first-generation Oakley Meta Smart Glasses at a 15% discount, bringing the price down from $449 to $382</a>. That $67 savings makes these futuristic frames far more tempting, especially for anyone hunting for a standout gadget or a gift that feels genuinely different.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/7075/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Tech and Style Come Together As One</h2>
<p>At first glance, the Oakley Meta Smart Glasses look like classic Oakley eyewear, but there’s a surprising amount of technology packed into the frames. Meta AI is integrated directly into the glasses, working alongside an HD ultra-wide 12MPl camera and built-in five-microphone array. Together, they let you capture photos and videos either by tapping or completely hands-free, using simple voice commands. You can also ask questions about what you’re looking at, save bits of information for later, or scan a QR code just by glancing at it.</p>
<p>Built-in open-ear speakers deliver clear sound without blocking out your surroundings. Spotify, Amazon Music, and Apple Music connect seamlessly, so playlists and podcasts are always within reach. Calls sound natural on both ends. A quick double-tap on the frame lets you switch between your phone’s front camera and the camera in the glasses, giving callers a live view of your perspective. Voice commands also handle calls, texts, and voice messages across apps like WhatsApp and Facebook Messenger, keeping your phone in your pocket.</p>



<p>One of the more impressive additions is real-time language translation. Conversations across languages happen naturally, even if you only speak your native tongue. Support currently includes English, French, Italian, Spanish, German, and Portuguese, with more languages planned. All of this works locally, so Wi-Fi isn’t required to keep the feature running.</p>
<p>Battery life holds up well for daily wear. The glasses last up to eight hours on a single charge, while the included charging case extends total usage to 48 hours. Pairing them with a smartphone unlocks the Meta View app, where photos, videos, voice controls, and system settings are easily managed.</p>
<p>Style hasn’t been overlooked either. Multiple frame colors and lens options, including clear and tinted varieties, help these glasses fit a range of looks. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/7075/">With the current Amazon discount dropping the price to $382, the Oakley Meta black frame smart glasses with polarized lenses feel far more accessible.</a> They even might just make for a thoughtful Valentine’s Day gift for someone who loves both fashion and tech.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Roblox Advertises AI Tools That Immediately Rip Off Clair Obscur: Expedition 33]]></title>
            <link>https://kotaku.com/clair-obscur-expedition-33-gen-ai-roblox-maelle-2000666407</link>
            <guid>1428001</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><span>The Roblox Corporation just revealed its new “real-time, action conditioned world model,” a generative AI tool for producing interactable videos that seems to work </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/google-ai-genai-nintendo-zelda-breath-wild-mario-64-project-genie-2000664227"><span>exactly like Google’s Project Genie</span></a><span>, which launched last week. While that one was able to rip off <em>Mario</em> and <em>Zelda</em>, the Roblox version is plagiarizing 2025’s Game of the Year.</span></p> <p><span>“We see several immediate uses for our Roblox world model,” the company announced on February 5. “We will use it side-by-side text, image and video prompts as a way to launch auto-generation of immersive worlds. In Roblox Studio, a creator could walk around and use prompts to ‘paint’ a world and then convert it into a 3D representation or direct to Roblox native as a way for many people to play simultaneously.”&nbsp;</span><span>It then proceeded to show a really ugly-looking version of </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/clair-obscur-expedition-33-rpg-review-in-progress-1851777402"><i><span>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</span></i></a> as proof.</p>

 <p><span>The strangest part of the entire reveal is that the world model tech that the Roblox Corporation decided to show off was actually an addendum to a completely separate reveal. The real announcement here is the impending release of their “</span><a href="https://about.roblox.com/newsroom/2026/02/accelerating-creation-powered-roblox-cube-foundation-model"><span>4D generation</span></a><span>” tech, a feature for the Cube Foundation Model that allows “creators and players to generate fully functional objects” that can be ported into </span><span>Roblox</span><span>, the platform its billions of users actually play on and spend money in.&nbsp;</span></p> <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">Are we supposed to pretend that isnt expedition 33 or are we selling that ai generation is theft on purpose?</p> <p>— Mjl8 (@xMJL8x) <a href="https://twitter.com/xMJL8x/status/2019496403471311281?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">February 5, 2026</a></p></blockquote>  <p><span>The genAI world model addendum was featured </span><a href="https://x.com/Roblox/status/2019221626387312810?s=20"><span>in a reply</span></a><span> made by the official Roblox X account to its 4D generation announcement, which explained that the “real-time, action conditioned world model” has been “trained on a combination of data, including proprietary Roblox 3D avatar/world interaction data.”</span></p>

 <p><span>The “including” part of the message here is clearly attempting to do a lot of heavy lifting, because everyone immediately noticed that the “woman in a glowing cave” prompt had unmistakably used footage of Sandfall Interactive’s </span><i><span>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 </span></i><span>to generate its “real-time dreaming” world.</span></p>

 <p><span>As one user very handily </span><a href="https://x.com/josephioanna/status/2019449659337458057?s=20"><span>pointed out</span></a><span> in their reply, it seems to have specifically used the Flying Waters location as inspiration, as well as Maelle’s model (including her outfit). “What do @SandfallGames think about this? I wonder what you trained your model on?”</span></p> <p><span>Sandfall Interactive has yet to make an official statement regarding Roblox Corporation’s world generation showcase. However, Nintendo hasn’t weighed in on Project Genie’s use of its assets and IPs either. That’s despite </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/video-game-stocks-down-take-two-gta-nintendo-roblox-unity-google-ai-game-maker-2000664594"><span>a drop in Nintendo’s share value</span></a><span> on January 30 that some analysts have directly attributed to Project Genie’s release.&nbsp;</span></p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/how-rockstar-hyped-people-up-for-gta-v-over-a-decade-ago-2000665773</link>
            <guid>1427971</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/grand-theft-auto-v-the-kotaku-review-1324730770"><em>Grand Theft Auto V</em> launched over a decade ago on Xbox 360 and PS3 in September 2013.</a> And its sequel, the highly anticipated <em>Grand Theft Auto 6</em>, is seemingly, finally, actually, for real, launching this November. Take-Two’s CEO is even promising that the <a href="https://kotaku.com/gta-6-still-confirmed-for-november-with-summer-marketing-blitz-planned-2000665452">game’s marketing will kick off this summer</a>.</p> <p>So, as we wait for that and hope the game doesn’t get delayed again, let’s look back at the complete timeline for<em> GTA V</em>‘s marketing and promotion, from announcement to release.</p> <h2>2011</h2> <p><em>GTA V</em> was officially announced on October 25, 2011, <a href="https://x.com/RockstarGames/status/128788090969001984">via a simple little tweet</a> that just said “#GTAV.” People went wild at the time as the last main installment in the series, <em>GTA IV</em>, had been released in 2008. Can you imagine waiting possibly four years for a <em>GTA</em> sequel?!?!</p>

 <figure id="attachment_2000666176" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000666176"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000666176">©Twitter / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p>One week later, on November 2, Rockstar released the <a href="https://youtu.be/QkkoHAzjnUs">first trailer for <em>Grand Theft Auto V</em>.</a> It featured narration by one of the game’s main characters, Michael, and showed beauty shots of Los Santos and the surrounding area. Young Zack watched this trailer way too many times. It ended without a release date. Then…nothing. Radio silence from Rockstar. The more things change…</p> <h2>2012</h2> <p>In July 2012, as part of a Rockstar Newswire post answering fan questions, <a href="https://www.rockstargames.com/newswire/article/4k4128838a3a4a/asked-answered-max-payne-3-and-grand-theft-auto-v.html#:~:text=however%2C%20manage%20to-,sneak%20a%20quick,-screenshot%20out%20for">Rockstar released two new screenshots of </a><em><a href="https://www.rockstargames.com/newswire/article/4k4128838a3a4a/asked-answered-max-payne-3-and-grand-theft-auto-v.html#:~:text=however%2C%20manage%20to-,sneak%20a%20quick,-screenshot%20out%20for">GTA V</a>.</em> They didn’t feature any main characters, but offered two new looks at the then-upcoming open-world game. Once again, a lot of <em>GTA</em> fans went wild over these crumbs.</p>

 <p>In August 2012, <a href="https://gta.fandom.com/wiki/Grand_Theft_Auto_V/Screenshots#:~:text=In%20August%202012,%5B5%5D">Rockstar teased fans with 10 more screenshots</a> released across three different posts throughout the month. The company also promised that more was coming in the near future. But fans would have to wait a little bit longer than planned.</p>

 <p>Rockstar planned to release a second trailer for <em>GTA V</em> on November 2. However, these plans were derailed when <a href="https://kotaku.com/hurricane-sandy-delays-second-gta-v-trailer-5957385">Hurricane Sandy slammed into New York City</a>, where Rockstar’s main HQ is located, and knocked out the power. The trailer would eventually be released 12 days later on November 14. It featured the excellent song “Skeletons” by Stevie Wonder, a song I can’t hear without thinking about this trailer.</p>  <p>In October, a year after the game was announced, Rockstar confirmed a leaked release date of <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2012/10/27/gta-v-coming-spring-2013">“Spring 2013” for the game</a>. In November, it started taking pre-orders for <em>GTA V</em>. Before 2012 ended, <a href="https://gameinformer.com/gtav"><em>Game Informer</em> ran a large cover story about </a><em><a href="https://gameinformer.com/gtav">Grand Theft Auto V</a>,</em> detailing a hands-off demo they were shown and revealing some other details about the game.</p>

 <h2>Early 2013</h2> <p>Rockstar kicked off the new year with bad news. On January 31, <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2013/01/31/grand-theft-auto-v-gets-a-september-release-date">Rockstar Games announced that <em>GTA V</em> had been delayed</a> from Spring 2013 to September 17, 2013.</p> <p>“To all <em>Grand Theft Auto</em> fans, please accept our apologies for the delay, and our promise that the entire team here is working very hard to make the game all it can be. We are doing all we can to help ensure it will meet, if not exceed, your expectations come September – we thank you for your support and patience,” posted Rockstar at the time.</p> <p>A few months later, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130406024311/http://www.kotaku.com.au/2013/04/new-mural-could-reveal-grand-theft-auto-v-box-art/">in April, Rockstar revealed the game’s official cover</a> via a mural painted on the side of a building in New York City. Later that same month, Rockstar Games released not one, not two, but <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2013/04/27/ign-live-presents-gta-5-character-trailers">three different trailers</a>. Each trailer focused on one of the three playable protagonists in the game. Younger Zack lost his shit that day, let me tell you. Rockstar would once more enter radio silence mode, but this would be the last time before an onslaught of marketing and promotion kicked off.</p>

 <h2>Summer 2013</h2> <p>On July 9, Rockstar finally shared actual gameplay of <em>GTA V</em> as part of a gameplay overview trailer. This was the first time most people had ever seen the game running on actual hardware, and it was wild to witness. I remember being shocked at how good it looked. Even today, all these years later, I still think the original version of<em> GTA</em> <em>V </em>and <em>GTA Online</em> look pretty dang good.</p>  <p><a href="https://gtaforums.com/topic/519075-new-epsilon-program-twitter-found/">Also in July, a viral marketing campaign began using an old <em>GTA San Andreas-</em>era website</a> mocking Scientology and cults. This would end up leading players to a fake Twitter account for the Epsilon Cult and would end with a way to audition to be in the game. <a href="https://screenrant.com/gta-5-6-casting-fans-epsilon-program/#:~:text=In%20the%20lead,the%20Epsilon%20Program.">Five people were picked and digitally added to <em>GTA V.</em></a></p>

 <p>Between August 13 and September 13, Rockstar began posting blogs on its website sharing even more details about <em>GTA V’</em>s world and characters, as well as new screenshots. The floodgates were truly open at this point.</p> <p>On August 15, <a href="https://youtu.be/olEGtoYs_8A">Rockstar released a gameplay overview showing off our first look at</a><em><a href="https://youtu.be/olEGtoYs_8A"> GTA Online</a>.</em> Looking back at it now, it is clear that Rockstar had no idea what this game would evolve into over the next decade. It looks so quaint now.</p>  <p>And finally, on August 29, 2013, just over two weeks before the launch of <em>GTA V</em> on Xbox and PlayStation, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ep5QfWMba-s">Rockstar released the final pre-release trailer for the game</a>. This was a shorter trailer and would end up being played on TV as <em>GTA V’</em>s launch commercial. If you were watching cable back around 2013, you likely saw this ad a few dozen times or more.</p>

 <p>That ends the marketing timeline for<em> GTA V.</em> Of course, the game would go on to be ported to many more platforms, get many more trailers, and spawn <em>GTA Online,</em> one of the most successful live-service games ever made. And it all started with a tweet in 2011.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[This Sony Soundbar Sees a Final Price Drop Before the Super Bowl, Now as Cheap as Budget Earbuds]]></title>
            <link>https://kotaku.com/this-sony-soundbar-sees-a-final-price-drop-before-the-super-bowl-now-as-cheap-as-budget-earbuds-2000666195</link>
            <guid>1427953</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>The Sony S100F 2.0ch Soundbar delivers clear audio for TV, movies, music, and other content without overwhelming your home theater setup. Simply set the soundbar in front of your TV and plug it in with a single cable to enjoy significantly improved audio over standard TV speakers. Its two-channel design, bass-reflex driver, and tweeter add depth to TV audio, while surround sound processing creates the illusion that sound comes from farther away. You can also pair your phone or tablet via Bluetooth with the soundbar and stream music or playlists when the TV is off.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5987/">You can purchase the Sony S100F 2.0ch Soundbar on Amazon now for just $98, saving $62 or 39% off its retail price of $160.</a></p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5987/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>An easy way to improve your TV’s default audio</h2>
<p>The S100F soundbar provides a direct, no-nonsense approach to delivering strong 2.0 channel audio and has sufficient power to pull audio out of the flatness often associated with most TVs’ built-in speakers. The tweeters inside the soundbar help the primary drivers better separate dialogue, effects, and background details, creating cleaner separation and less blending of these elements. The Bass Reflex architecture in the soundbar is specifically designed to deliver additional energy to low-end frequencies, greatly enhancing the impact of action scenes, music, and game audio, all without the need for an external subwoofer to take up valuable floor space.</p>
<p>In addition, S-Force Pro Front Surround Processing is included to enhance the soundbar’s stereo field. While the soundbar is only a few inches wide, it has been engineered to simulate a much wider sound field by shaping how it projects audio throughout the room. Voice Enhancement is another feature that makes the S100F soundbar extremely practical for those who have difficulty hearing soft-spoken lines and fast-paced conversations amid loud soundtracks.</p>



<p>Connectivity options accommodate common configurations. For example, the soundbar supports HDMI ARC, which allows many modern TVs to send both audio and basic control commands to the soundbar through a single cable, eliminating the need for multiple remotes and cables. Bluetooth supports wireless music streaming from devices such as mobile phones and tablets. This allows users to easily switch between TV audio and music playback without turning on their TV.</p>
<p>The compact form factor and ease of use contribute to a user-friendly experience that doesn’t disrupt normal daily routines. The soundbar is small enough to be placed below or on top of a TV, or mounted to the wall, depending on the user’s preferences. The remote control is simple to use and lets users choose from different sound modes, toggle Voice Enhancement on or off, and adjust the soundbar’s volume. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5987/">At the moment, the Sony S100F 2.0ch Soundbar is available at Amazon for only $98, down from the typical retail price of $160, and represents a significant step up from standard TV speakers without requiring a complex installation process.</a></p>
