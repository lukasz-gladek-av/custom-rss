            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              
              <p>During a recent concert, pop star and former <em>American Idol</em> judge Katy Perry was asked by a fan in the audience to sing the Simlish version of “Last Friday Night” as it appeared in <a href="https://kotaku.com/the-sims-3-sucks-1826683414"><em>The Sims 3</em></a>‘s DLC “<a href="https://kotaku.com/katy-perry-is-now-making-video-games-5876893">Katy Perry’s Sweet Treats.</a>” And the singer obliged, singing a good chunk of the song live in front of a lot of people who were likely confused as to why Perry was suddenly singing in gibberish.</p> <p>Released in 2009, Maxis and EA’s <em>The Sims 3</em> was a massive hit and received plenty of post-launch DLC and updates, as is the case with nearly every major <em>Sims</em> game. One of these DLCs was a <a href="https://sims.fandom.com/wiki/The_Sims_3:_Katy_Perry%27s_Sweet_Treats">2012 Stuff Pack that was themed entirely around Katy Perry</a>. It added new clothes, hairstyles, in-game items, and locations to <em>The Sims 3.</em> It also included a new in-game song: A version of “Last Friday Night” sung in Simlish (the franchise’s made-up language) by Katy Perry. It was a pretty popular pack, and her Simlish rendition of the pop hit became a bit of a viral meme back in the day. Fast forward to August 6 of this year when–as seen in a video posted on Twitter–Perry was handed a piece of paper at a concert that contained the lyrics to that Simlish version of the song.</p> <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">there's always sth unexpected happening at katy perry’s tour cuz wdym we got Last Friday Night sims version on the setlist last night 😭 <a href="https://t.co/7cGTbVzJTw">pic.twitter.com/7cGTbVzJTw</a></p> <p>— Fadi ¹⁴³ (@TheWitnessedBoy) <a href="https://twitter.com/TheWitnessedBoy/status/1953382847382741409?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">August 7, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <p>“Oh no, I shouldn’t do this…” Perry joked as she walked up to some fans who appeared to be signaling for attention and requesting her to sing the Simlish pop song. She then added, “Let’s just go to the chorus,” likely not wanting to perform the entire song in Simlish during a live concert. To Perry’s credit, she sang the strange version of the song using the provided lyrics, despite being unable to read the small text properly without her reading glasses.</p> <p>After singing, she shouted out, “I’m sorry, you had to be there, 2009 and 10.” Which is funny, but also inaccurate, Katy Perry. You performed the Simlish version of “Last Friday Night” in 2012. There’s even a video of you singing it in a recording booth for EA! Speaking of, let’s end this blog with that video. Roll that footage!</p> <p><iframe loading="lazy" title="Katy Perry - Last Friday Night in Simlish" width="500" height="281" src="about:blank" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen="" data-rocket-lazyload="fitvidscompatible" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/sxyW6AJ-yIk?feature=oembed"></iframe></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              
              <p>The sun just refuses to set on <a href="https://kotaku.com/gta-online-gtav-ps5-xbox-series-x-next-gen-review-impre-1848652706"><em>Grand Theft Auto Online</em></a>. Even with<em> GTA 6</em> delayed into next year, the current entry’s multiplayer mode is seeing an surprising surge in new and returning players. Rockstar Games’ parent company, Take-Two, just revealed the 12-year-old spin-off is 50 percent more popular than it was last year.</p> <p>“During the quarter, engagement for <em>Grand Theft Auto Online</em>&nbsp;benefited from the record-setting launch of&nbsp;<em>Grand Theft Auto VI</em> Trailer 2 and the successful release of the ‘<em>Money Fronts</em>‘ Summer content pack, which culminated in higher than expected recurrent consumer spending growth,” the company announced in its quarterly earnings report this week. “We are pleased that new player accounts<em>&nbsp;</em>for&nbsp;<em>GTA Online&nbsp;</em>grew over 50 percent year-over-year.”</p> <p>Every company that delays one of the most anticipated releases of all-time by more than six months should be so lucky. At this rate, Rockstar could push back the release of <em>GTA 6</em> from May to October 2026 and see <em>GTA Online</em> potentially double in popularity in just two years, <a href="https://kotaku.com/gta-online-future-updates-gta6-take-two-ceo-support-1851763665">merely by dropping new trailers for the sequel</a>.</p>

 <p>I guess all of those people still buying <em>GTA V</em> each month are for real. The game was the <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/matpiscatella.bsky.social/post/3lun37lnhg22k">ninth best-selling game of the year so far in June</a>. That was up from being the 15th best-selling overall in 2024. Even if that number eventually comes down by the end of 2025, it would still be incredible if<em> GTA V</em> sold&nbsp;<em>just as well</em> as it had the year prior after more than a decade of being out in the wild.</p> <p>No wonder Rockstar has been content to take its time with the sequel while everyone else selling games on consoles battles to convince <em>GTA Online</em> fans to take a chance on buying something new. Shutting <em>GTA Online</em> down for good would be terrible for Take-Two’s shareholders but it <a href="https://kotaku.com/best-selling-games-2024-hogwarts-legacy-dragon-ball-1851746095">might spread the wealth around a bit</a> and give great games from other studios a better shot at getting recognized. Or all of those people would just go play <em>Fortnite</em> and <em>Roblox</em> instead.</p>

              <p>Big news, everyone! Capcom has heard all your pleading and begging and has finally announced a brand new <a href="https://kotaku.com/exoprimal-dino-crisis-reboot-sequel-dinosaur-shooter-ca-1849066060"><em>Dino Crisis</em></a>…merchandise lottery event. Wait, is that not what all you fans have been clamoring for over the last 20 years? Oh…well, uh, this is almost as good as a new game, right?</p> <p>On August 8, <a href="https://www.resetera.com/threads/new-official-dino-crisis-merchandises-revealed-by-capcom-japan.1265337/">as first spotted by ResetEra users</a>, Capcom announced a new merch event themed around its classic survival horror series, <em>Dino Crisis.</em> The event runs from now until September 12 and features a variety of <a href="https://capcom-capkujionline.com/lp/DINO_CRISIS/">new <em>Dino Crisis</em> merchandise</a>, including desk mats, sweaters, keychains, and stickers. You can’t just buy this stuff directly, though. Instead, Capcom is operating this merch event like a raffle or lottery. Each <em>Dino Crisis</em> item in the event has a rarity scale. For example, the sweater has a 1-in-100 chance of shipping. You can purchase one or more “tickets” for 880 Yen (about $6 USD) and then Capcom ships out however many items you ordered, and you hope you got lucky enough to get some of the rarer ones, like the desk mat, which has a 3-in-100 chance of arriving at your doorstep.</p> <figure><figcaption>Capcom</figcaption></figure> <p>This new merch sale is the latest example of Capcom remembering <em>Dino Crisis,</em> but not actually announcing a new game or even teasing a hypothetical remake or fancy remaster. In 2024, <a href="https://kotaku.com/capcom-survey-dino-crisis-sequel-remake-onimusha-okami-1851235768">Capcom asked fans what dormant franchises they would like revived</a>. One of the options was <em>Dino Crisis</em>, and the internet screamed loudly, “That one please!” That same year, <em>Dino Crisis</em> arrived on GOG with a few appreciated improvements. <a href="https://kotaku.com/dino-crisis-siren-ps2-horror-ps-plus-games-october-2024-1851669030">It was also released on PlayStation 5 and PlayStation 4</a> as part of Sony’s PS Plus Premium retro library, complete with new trophies. And now we have this new merch sale.</p> <p>So it’s clear Capcom remembers that it owns<em> Dino Crisis.</em> That’s an important first step toward getting a new game or sequel. Of course, when or if that will ever happen remains to be seen. But at least you can (sort of) buy a cool <em>Dino Crisis</em> sweater right now? That’s neat.</p>
