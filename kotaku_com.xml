It wasn’t a complete surprise, however, as there had been some clues that everything on the existing hardware might carry over to the Switch 2. Nintendo of America President Doug Bowser <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/switch-2-nintendo-account-backwards-compatibility-1850945091?_gl=1*5677a9*_ga*MzQzNjkwNDM2LjE2NDY2NjQ1NzQ.*_ga_V4QNJTT5L0*MTczMDQ4NDU5MC41Ny4xLjE3MzA0ODg4ODQuNDguMC4w&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/switch-2-nintendo-account-backwards-compatibility-1850945091?_gl=1*5677a9*_ga*MzQzNjkwNDM2LjE2NDY2NjQ1NzQ.*_ga_V4QNJTT5L0*MTczMDQ4NDU5MC41Ny4xLjE3MzA0ODg4ODQuNDguMC4w">previously suggested</a></span> that the company was focused on creating a smooth transition between consoles. At the same time, no one would have put it past Nintendo to do the unthinkable and buck the current expectations around taking your older game libraries into the future. </p><p>With Switch Online also being compatible with the next console, it seems like all of the emulation work Nintendo’s already done to make NES, SNES, Nintendo 64, Game Boy, Game Boy Advance, and Sega Genesis games work on its modern platform won’t have to be repeated this time around when switching from one device’s virtual console to another.</p><p>But where does this leave the Switch 2's actual announcement? “Further information about the successor to Nintendo Switch, including its compatibility with Nintendo Switch, will be announced at a later date,” Furukawa added in his tweet. Many expected a reveal as early as September or October. Now, however, the window for a 2024 announcement seems to be closing fast, especially as the company prepares for its holiday blitz aimed at selling millions more of the existing Switch models. </p><p>Nintendo previously said it would announce the Switch 2, or whatever it ends up calling the successor console, before the end of March 2025. Despite the wait, the company reiterated that time-table today, saying nothing had changed. </p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

It’s the most recent game from the video game auteur Hideo Kojima, known for games like the genre-defining stealth series, <em>Metal Gear Solid</em> and it’s on sale on Steam at the moment! <strong>You’ve got till November 11 to pick up </strong><em><strong>Death Stranding Director’s Cut </strong></em><strong>for $20 on Steam, and I think it’s the perfect game for the moment.</strong></p><p>In <em>Death Stranding, </em>you play as Sam Porter Bridges, a sort of post-apocalyptic delivery man who’s tasked with trekking across the ruins of the United States of America, reconnecting the various cities and settlements you find via the erection of new infrastructure, and healing a fragmented nation. I don’t know exactly why, but something about that just feels so resonant and timely.</p><p>In <em>Death Stranding</em>, you literally walk across the country. It’s kind of abridged, because <em>that </em>version of this game would take even longer than <em>Death Stranding </em>currently is, but that is the literal goal here. There are alternative ways of traveling, including zipines that you can establish, as well as vehicles that you can eventually unlock, but the main thing you will do in <em>Death Stranding </em>is walk across plains, hike up mountains, and stumble into creeks and rivers. If you’ve ever wanted to touch grass from the safety of your bed or couch, this is the game for you.<br></p><p>When <em>Death Stranding </em>was first released in 2019, it wasn’t the most popular thing in the world. Many balked at the thought of Kojima making a game that’s essentially one big “walking simulator,” a term that’s been thrown around derogatorily for years. Though Kojima’s narratives and characters are often larger than life, <em>Death Stranding</em> appeared to steer more into the esoteric than fans of his were willing to entertain, with hokily named folks like Die-Hardman taking up significant space. Despite the fact that <em>Death Stranding </em>did feature stealth, combat, celebrities from film and TV, as well as some major set pieces, it didn’t land with the impact of a typical Kojima game, and was even viewed as a bit of a rogue move from the esteemed developer.</p><p>As always though, Kojima was simply a bit <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/video-games-innovative-gta3-skyrim-1850976541&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/video-games-innovative-gta3-skyrim-1850976541">ahead of his time</a></span>. This is after all the guy responsible for countless prescient <em>Metal Gear Solid </em>titles, specifically <em>Sons of Liberty </em>and <em>Guns of the Patriots</em>. The year after <em>Death Stranding</em>—a game about the isolation bred from the increasingly polarized political attitudes in the world, as well as a pandemic-like cataclysm—COVID-19 upended the lives of everyone around the world, initiating a global shutdown and plummeting society into a deeply isolating and dark period in our history. As people began to note the parallels between our own nightmare of a reality and the world of <em>Death Stranding</em>, the game outgrew its oddball status, took on cult acclaim, and now there’s even a <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/death-stranding-2-release-date-trailer-tgs-2024-panel-1851660760&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/death-stranding-2-release-date-trailer-tgs-2024-panel-1851660760">weird-ass sequel</a></span> on the way.</p><p>Now it’s timely all over again for, y’know, <em>other </em>reasons. Reasons for which it was also timely this time four years ago. Maybe we all ought to sit down with <em>Death Stranding </em>and learn a thing or two from Sam Bridges so that we can sidestep the cataclysms in our own lives.</p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Games, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://variety.com/2024/tv/news/harry-potter-franchise-future-tv-series-video-games-1236201249/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://variety.com/2024/tv/news/harry-potter-franchise-future-tv-series-video-games-1236201249/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">told <em>Variety</em> in a new interview</a></span>. “Our insights tell us that there are not huge distinctions between a younger version of a fan and an older version of a fan. They’re just deep<em> Harry Potter </em>fans, and we try to build authentic experiences to delight them.”</p><p> Those experiences include <em>Hogwarts Legacy 2</em>, which, while not officially announced yet, is a “one of the biggest priorities” for the publisher, and an HBO series that will give the original books the <em>Game of Thrones </em>treatment. Here’s an excerpt from the<em> Variety</em> piece:</p><blockquote data-type="BlockQuote"><p>Haddad says the games team has been coordinating some of the big-picture storytelling elements in the “Hogwarts Legacy” sequel with the storylines that will play out in the “Harry Potter” HBO series coming from Warner Bros. Television. He notes that the success of “Hogwarts Legacy” helped stoke confidence that the time was right to make a major Potter push: “The rest of the company was very curious about what we helped to unlock with ‘Hogwarts Legacy’ last year.”</p></blockquote><p>Warner Bros. Discovery CEO David Zazlav <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://deadline.com/2024/09/harry-potter-tv-series-max-release-date-cast-1235323284/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://deadline.com/2024/09/harry-potter-tv-series-max-release-date-cast-1235323284/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">confirmed earlier this year</a></span> that the plan was for the <em>Harry Potter </em>TV show to hit in 2026, with casting for main characters like Hermione Granger and Ron Weasley already underway. <em>Hogwarts Legacy 2</em>, meanwhile, seems unlikely to arrive until 2027 or 2028 at the earliest as big-budget games continue development timelines of 4-6 years and beyond. </p><p>The original game takes place in the 1890s, and while it’s not clear when a sequel would be set, it would likely be laying the groundwork for the particular flavor of <em>Hogwarts</em>’ history to be referenced in the TV remake, no doubt with Marvel-style easter eggs to pull fans from one to the other. </p><p>As for J.K. Rowling’s ongoing involvement in <em>Harry Potter</em>, Haddad said that while she is not directly involved in any planning related to the universe outside of the books, the controversy-courting YA author is still kept in the loop. “If we’re going to ever go beyond a canon conversation, we make sure that we’re all comfortable with what we’re doing,” Robert Oberschelp, Warner Bros.
