              <p>Everybody loves a surprise, especially one that saves money. Amazon’s limited-time 43%-off deal on the newest model of their Fire TV Stick HD is already a stellar offer. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4359/">Smash that button and the Fire TV Stick HD is all yours for a record-low price of just $20&nbsp;— nearly half off its regular $35 price.</a></p>
<p>This is the latest and greatest version of Amazon’s streaming stick, and we can say that with total confidence because we have over 42,000 Amazon reviewers backing us up on it. Their average rating for the Amazon Fire TV Stick HD is a spectacular 4.7 stars, with kudos being handed out for the quality, ease of setup, ease of use, and overall value for the price. Assuming most of those reviews were lauding the Fire TV Stick HD’s value for its original $35 price, that value now basically doubles.</p>

<h2>Even the Smart TVs Benefit</h2>
<p>With virtually all new TVs now being manufactured with built-in streaming ability, you might think the streaming stick and other external streaming devices are on their way to the ash heap of history, next to the VCR, the 8-track, and a long list of other once-cutting-edge technology. We’d never bet against progress, but as long as the Fire TV Stick HD has such a clean, intuitive interface and user experience as compared to many of those Smart TVs, it won’t be going anywhere.</p>
<p>Everything about the Amazon Fire TV Stick HD is about ease. The installation is totally plug-and-play, just plug it into your TV’s HDMI port and it’s up and running. There’s no external power source since it runs off the power of your TV, and no complicated setup steps of any kind. It’s perfect for first-time streamers or anyone who goes crosseyed when they look at the home screen of their Smart TV.</p>



<h2>More Than Streaming</h2>
<p>The name says TV Stick, but since this is an Amazon device, you know it can do far more. Voice commands for Alexa work for streaming and also for smart home devices like your thermostat, lights, smart camera, and more. The Fire TV Stick HD is also able to play your favorite music streaming services like Amazon Music, Spotify, Pandora, and others, and its included remote can also control your compatible TV and home theater devices.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/amazon-fire-tv-stick-hd/dp/B0CQMRKRV5/?tag=kotaku01-20">The tiny $20 price tag that pops up on the Fire TV Stick HD when you stack Amazon’s 43% off deal</a>&nbsp;is a sensational price for a top-line streaming stick that brings effortless and easy to navigate streaming to your TV, but also to any TV with an HDMI port. What could be more portable than a pocket-sized streaming stick that requires no cords and no external power source? The best sub-$20 streaming device is just a click away at Amazon.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Lenovo’s official website rarely offers meaningful discounts, and finding premium laptops marked down more than 20% feels like winning a small lottery. The real clearance action happens on Amazon, where manufacturers quietly offload inventory at prices that make you question if there’s a typo. The <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4919/">Lenovo Ideapad Slim 3 with an Intel Core i7-13620H processor, 40GB DDR5 RAM, and 1TB PCIe SSD has crashed to an all-time low of $799 on Amazon</a>, down from its typical $2,999 price tag. That’s a staggering <strong>$2,200 discount and a massive 73% savings</strong> that transforms a high-end business laptop into something accessible for students.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4919/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Premium Hardware at Budget Pricing</h2>
<p>The Intel Core i7-13620H is the 13th generation Intel processor which is a hybrid model that comes with 10 cores: <strong>6 performance cores and 4 efficiency cores</strong>. The processor has the efficiency cores perform simple tasks in the background so that actual tough tasks requiring processing are attended by the performance cores for both speed and smooth functioning when using the CPU. The performance cores operate at a speed of 2.4 GHz, boosting to 4.9 GHz when additional processing is needed for activities such as video processing or calculations involving numerous formulas in a Microsoft Office sheet.</p>
<p>The 16 threads through its 10 cores allow it to run multiple apps at once without causing the system to come to a standstill. Open your Chrome browser with 30 tabs, use your Photoshop, Premiere Pro, Slack, Spotify and other apps running in the background, and still, it will respond better than budget-friendly systems that only come with a dual-core or quad-core processor. The <strong>24MB cache helps it access frequently used resources</strong> without having to wait for the system’s storage for that access.</p>



<p>Memory configuration makes a substantial difference in real-world performance, and <strong>40GB DDR5 RAM puts this laptop in workstation territory</strong>. DDR5 represents the newest memory standard with significantly higher bandwidth than DDR4 and allows faster data transfer between RAM and the processor. This capacity handles memory-intensive workflows like running multiple virtual machines for software development, editing 4K video footage with effects layers, working with large datasets in Excel or data analysis software or keeping dozens of browser tabs active without performance degradation</p>
<p>The 1TB PCIe NVMe SSD has more than enough storage for operating systems and files, besides offering <strong>read transfers at a rate of 3,500 MB/sec and write transfers at a rate of 3,000 MB/sec</strong> on average for PCIe v3.x speeds. This results in Windows launching in a few seconds, applications launching almost instantly, and the time for file transfers being dramatically faster than hard drives or SATA SSDs.</p>



<p>The <strong>display has a 15.3-inch screen with a resolution of 1920×1200 pixels</strong>. The added vertical resolution (when compared to 1920×1080 Full HD) is beneficial for professionals like programmers or document writers, where every pixel matters. The display employs an IPS display type that boasts excellent viewing angles and color accuracy regardless of the angle, and its 300-nit luminance helps it remain visible in brightly lit environs or near windows.</p>
<p>Connectivity also features contemporary standards, so that Wi-Fi 6 enables faster wireless throughput than its predecessor, Wi-Fi 5. The Bluetooth 5.2 standard takes care of wireless peripherals such as computer mice and headphones for greater range and lower latency. Connect options include requirements for everyday use, such as <strong>two USB-A jacks for connecting legacy accessories, a USB-C port that can provide Power Delivery for faster charging</strong>&nbsp;along with DisplayPort output for computer displays, an HDMI 1.4 output for presentations, a headphone jack, and access through SD-card slots that benefit photographers for camera transfers.</p>
<p>At $799 with a 4.5-star rating from nearly 1,000 buyers, this deal delivers specifications that typically cost $1,500-2,000 even on sale.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/this-jackery-1500w-portable-power-station-drops-50-off-amazon-preps-you-for-winter-outages-2000639219</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Winter storms knock out power without warning and leave homes dark and cold for hours (or even days). Having backup power stops being a luxury and becomes essential when your heating system shuts down, your refrigerator starts warming up and your phones need charging to stay connected with emergency services. The <strong>Jackery Explorer 1000</strong> portable (1500W) power station addresses exactly this scenario with enough capacity to run critical appliances during outages. Right now, <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5029/">it’s hit an all-time low of $419 on Amazon, slashed from its regular $839 price</a>. This <strong>50% discount makes serious emergency preparedness accessible</strong> without the commitment and installation costs of whole-home generators.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5029/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Power That Covers the Essentials</h2>
<p>The <strong>1,070Wh energy storage allows for actual use time</strong>&nbsp;and that’s important during emergency situations. This model will support a contemporary refrigerator for 10 to 12 hours, thereby preserving food during a power outage. Use it to heat a room for 4 to 5 hours when set to low output for a space heater, or use it to power LED lights, allowing them to keep shining for several days. The <strong>pure sine wave AC has a 1,500W continuous power</strong> output and comes with 3,000W surges that can handle motor startups for refrigerators or furnace fans.</p>
<p>The emergency charge feature through the Jackery app allows for a <strong>quick recharge to full power in only 1 hour</strong>. Normal portable chargers can only recharge to full power in 6 to 8 hours and gaps exist during multi-day power outage situations. This particular power bank will reach 100% power in 60 minutes only when emergency mode is enabled, although it comes optimized for 1.7-hour recharge for better battery longevity.</p>



<p>The chemistry used in the energy storage system – <strong>LiFePO4 (Lithium Iron Phosphate) – has a significantly longer lifespa</strong>n than that used in standard lithium-ion batteries that are found inside low-cost energy stations. This type of battery retains more than 70% of its original capacity after 4,000 charge cycles, meaning that it will last for more than 10 years. Standard lithium-ion batteries normally depreciate to 80% after 500 to 1,000 charge cycles.</p>
<p>The port options include both contemporary and traditional devices: The<strong> two USB-C ports support a total output of 100W Power Delivery</strong> for fast charging of laptops, tablets, or smartphones without requiring additional wall chargers. The <strong>USB-A port is for traditional laptops</strong>, and functions at standard rates. The <strong>three AC plug options</strong> allow for the simultaneous use of several appliances, such as a lamp, computer charger, and phone, at the same time. The <strong>DC car port option</strong> supports 12V-powered appliances such as portable coolers or tire pumps.</p>



<p>This time, the <strong>bundle comes with a 16-foot extension cord</strong> that is specifically made for use when connecting solar panels. The placement of the solar panels (sold separately) has to be carried out while exposing them to sunlight and the stations, on the other hand, need to remain either under cover or in vehicles. The weight – 23.8 pounds – is portable and make it simple to relocate from room to room.</p>
<p>With a price tag of $419 and a rating of 4.7 stars from buyers, it is an incredible bargain for a true emergency-power solution that works when it matters.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/new-ecoflow-delta-3-goes-for-peanuts-amazon-clears-out-4-7-rated-portable-power-station-2000639124</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/new-ecoflow-delta-3-goes-for-peanuts-amazon-clears-out-4-7-rated-portable-power-station.1335406/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Power outages, camping trips and outdoor events all share one frustrating problem:<strong> you need electricity where there isn’t any</strong> or you can’t rely on the grid to stay up when you need it most. Portable power stations solve this by packing serious battery capacity into something you can actually move around and <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5002/">EcoFlow’s Delta 3 just hit an all-time low of $519 on Amazon, dropped from its usual $699 price</a>. This <strong>1024Wh unit can power 13 devices simultaneously</strong>, charges from dead to full in under an hour, and uses LiFePO4 battery chemistry that’s rated for 4000 cycles over a 10-year lifespan.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5002/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Fantastic 1500W Continuous Power</h2>
<p>The Delta 3’s charging speed is what separates it from cheaper alternatives that take eight to ten hours to refill. EcoFlow engineered <strong>this unit to accept up to 1500W from a wall outlet and 500W from solar panels simultaneously</strong> which means you can throw 2000W of combined input at the battery. In practice, this gets you from zero to 100% in just 56 minutes when using both AC and solar input together. Even using just the wall charger alone, you’re looking at about 90 minutes for a full charge.</p>



<p>The battery itself uses LiFePO4 chemistry which is lithium iron phosphate, a different formulation than the lithium-ion cells in your phone or laptop. LiFePO4 cells are more stable, less prone to thermal runaway and significantly more durable over repeated charge cycles. <strong>EcoFlow rates the Delta 3 for 4000 cycles to 80% capacity</strong>&nbsp;which means you can fully charge and discharge this battery 4000 times before it degrades to 80% of its original capacity. That’s 25% more cycles than industry standard portable power stations,<strong> and it translates to roughly 10 years of daily use</strong>. The battery pack carries an IP65 rating, which indicates protection against dust ingress and water jets from any direction.</p>
<p>Capacity sits at 1024Wh. To put that in perspective, a typical laptop draws about 60W so you could run it for roughly 17 hours. A mini fridge pulling 100W would run for about 10 hours. A CPAP machine for sleep apnea averages 30-60W and would operate through multiple nights on a single charge. The <strong>1800W AC output means the Delta 3 can handle power-hungry devices like microwaves, coffee makers, power tools</strong> and space heaters. EcoFlow’s X-Boost technology pushes this even further by supporting resistive load appliances up to 2600W, though with some performance reduction.</p>



<p>The<strong> port options provide a total of 13 outlet options</strong>&nbsp;which come in various types. There are <strong>six AC outlet slots on the front of the unit</strong>&nbsp;which is more than what most of its contemporaries provide. However, this still won’t be enough if you plan on using all of your gadgets simultaneously. The <strong>USB-C port provides a total of 100W</strong> which is enough to provide a rapid charge for your laptop, tablet, or smartphone. There’s also a <strong>12V car outlet</strong> perfect for gadgets intended for use inside a vehicle. Additionally, there’s a DC5521 outlet.</p>
<p>Make sure you don’t miss that deal, it’s a record low price for the latest EcoFlow power station.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/sony-quietly-liquidates-xm4-stock-at-new-record-low-amazon-just-sold-10k-units-2000639122</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/sony-quietly-liquidates-xm4-stock-at-new-record-low-amazon-just-sold-10k-units.1335403/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Noise-canceling headphones have become essential gear for commuters and travelers who need to block out the world and focus on what matters. Sony just quietly liquidated XM4 inventory on Amazon, <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3787/">dropping the price to $198 from the usual $348</a>, and the timing is interesting because both the XM5 and XM6 are on the market at nearly three times this price.</p>
<p>Here’s the thing though: the technological improvements between these new generations are minimal and most users can’t tell the difference in real-world use. The XM4 delivers the same<strong> exceptional active noise cancellation, 30-hour battery life, multipoint connection, and premium sound quality</strong> that made Sony the leader in this category. Amazon has already moved over 10,000 units at this all-time low price, and it’s easy to see why.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3787/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Industry-Leading Noise Cancelation</h2>
<p>The core feature that made the XM4 legendary is Sony’s Dual Noise Sensor technology which <strong>uses microphones on both the outside and inside of each earcup to capture ambient sound</strong>. The <em>HD Noise Canceling Processor QN1</em> analyzes this audio data over 700 times per second and generates inverse sound waves that cancel out unwanted noise. This isn’t passive isolation from thick padding, though the earcups do provide physical noise blocking too: This is active electronic cancellation that targets low-frequency rumble like airplane engines, train noise and air conditioning systems.</p>



<p>The noise cancellation levels on the Sony can <strong>now be adjusted by an additional 20 levels through an app,</strong> and gives you complete control over how much of the environment you can shut out. The ambient sound mode reverses this by letting ambient sound come in through the headphones, which can be useful if you need announcements in an airport or traffic direction if you’re on foot. Again, there are 20 levels of adjustment there. The <em>Quick Attention</em> mode can be activated by resting your hand on top of the right cup which will instantly give you ambient sound while reducing the volume of your music.</p>
<p>The <strong>battery life reaches an impressive 30 hours of non-stop use</strong> with active noise cancellation, which will take you through not one but multiple cross-country flights or an entire week of commuting. The quick charging function is a lifesaver if you remember too late that you need to plug them in before bed. Charging via USB-C will give you an additional 5 hours of use after just 10 minutes of charging. Charging from empty will take a mere 3 hours.</p>



<p>The <strong>touch controls on the right side of the headband</strong> allow all of your playback and calling controls right at your fingertips. Simply swipe up or down to change the volume, swipe forward or backward to skip tracks, tap once to play or pause playback, or tap twice to answer or hang up a phone call. The touch controls take a little getting used to if you’re accustomed to physical buttons, but after a day of using them, they become second nature. The voice assistant compatibility comes with both Alexa and Google Assistant which can be accessed by either giving it the wake-up phrase or by pressing and holding the touch panel.</p>
<p>Wear detection uses a proximity sensor on the left ear cup that <strong>automatically pauses audio playback when you take off the headphones</strong> and resumes playback when you put them on. This conserves battery life as well as ensures that you do not miss anything in your podcast or audiobook. The XM4 headphones come with multipoint technology that allows you to pair two different devices simultaneously. For instance, you can be connected to your laptop as well as your smartphone. The audio automatically switches from one device to another according to which is in use.</p>
<p>At $198, you’re paying less than many mid-tier noise-canceling headphones while getting performance that rivals anything on the market today, regardless of price.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/dyson-dumps-supersonic-hair-dryer-stock-now-selling-for-pennies-against-what-salons-charge-2000639117</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/dyson-dumps-supersonic-hair-dryer-stock-now-selling-for-pennies-against-what-salons-charge.1335397/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Professional blowouts at a high-end salon easily run $60 to $100 per session and if you’re getting your hair done weekly, that’s thousands of dollars annually for results that last just a few days. Dyson just dropped the <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4621/">Supersonic Origin hair dryer to $299 on Amazon, slashed from its usual $419 price</a>, and at this all-time low, you’re paying the equivalent of three to five salon visits for a tool that delivers the same professional-grade results at home for years to come.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4621/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<p>This isn’t your average drugstore hair dryer: The Supersonic <strong>packs Dyson’s digital motor V9 that spins at 110,000 RPM</strong>, <strong>intelligent heat control</strong> that measures air temperature 40 times per second, and <strong>Air Multiplier technology</strong> that amplifies airflow by three times.</p>
<h2>Changes the Way You Dry Your Hair</h2>
<p>The key motor element of the Supersonic is Dyson’s digital motor V9: This motor is a brushless DC motor which is much smaller and more lightweight than traditional hair dryer motors. Typical conventional dryers place the motor in the foundation of the unit but Dyson relocated this motor to the handle of its unit. The motor’s speed of 110,000 RPM has more than just show value: This speed powers an impeller which draws air into its chambers. The motor pulls this air into its chambers at a rate of 13 liters of air every second.</p>



<p>The Air Multiplier technology is taken from Dyson’s bladeless fans. The function of this technology is the <strong>induction of air from the motor and then amplifying it through a carefully created hole</strong>. This amplifies the air into a <strong>three times more powerful jet of air</strong> than the motor’s capability, but this air comes from a smooth airflow. For this reason, it becomes capable of drying your hair sections quickly without releasing it all over the place.</p>



<p>The area where the Dyson Supersonic differs from more affordable models is heat control: The unit comes equipped with a glass bead thermistor sensor located in the airflow that t<strong>racks the temperature of the air up to 40 times every second</strong>. This information is then used by the microprocessor to make adjustments on the fly to ensure it does not reach unsafe levels. High temperatures damage hair by breaking down the protein bonds which makes it brittle, dry, and easy to break. The problem with most conventional dryers is that it can often reach temperatures above 300°F which is damaging enough on its own: The <strong>Supersonic keeps its top speed below 230°F</strong>.</p>
<p>Another field that Dyson ventured into is acoustic engineering: The hair dryer is a device that has always been known to generate considerable noise levels. This happens as the motor, along with airflow, produces sound waves of undesirable frequencies that tend to cause irritation in human ears. Dyson’s design of the motor ensures the <strong>generation of sound waves of frequencies higher than 16kHz&nbsp;which cannot be detected by human ears</strong>. Additionally, Dyson provided an acoustic silencer in the airflow path which serves to suppress sound waves. The outcome is a hair dryer that produces less noise than its predecessors.</p>
<p>The Dyson Origin series has only one magnetic attachment which is the styling concentrator. The styling concentrator is used for focusing airflow which enables the user to dry or style his or her hair. The magnetic attachment system is an excellent design aspect of this series: The user can easily switch from one attachment to another without waiting for it to cool down or handling it with hot hands.</p>
