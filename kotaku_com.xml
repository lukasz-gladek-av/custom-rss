            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><em>The Edge of Fate</em> was supposed to be a bold new foundation for <a href="https://kotaku.com/playstation-bungie-marathon-destiny-2-acquisition-fiscal-2000642935"><em>Destiny 2</em>‘s future</a>. Instead, it was the beginning of the decade-old sci-fi shooter’s most disappointing stretch yet. Back in September, Bungie promised a roadmap laying out the vision for the live-service MMO in the year ahead. Two months later, the plans are still in flux. Bungie now says it won’t be ready to reveal what <em>Destiny 2</em> looks like moving forward until early 2026. In the meantime, it’s scrambling to engineer a 180 with its upcoming <em>Star Wars </em>expansion.</p> <p>“As we continue to act on your feedback, we’re taking additional time to craft our long-term strategy for the future of <em>Destiny</em> before we share a full State of the Game and multi-year roadmap next year,” the studio revealed this week. It treated fans to what it’s called a new “Content Calendar” instead. No big ideas. No major overhauls. But it did preview everything fans can expect from the <a href="https://kotaku.com/destiny-2-star-wars-renegades-lightsaber-x-wing-ash-iron-2000624489">December 2 <em>Renegades</em> expansion</a> and its first significant update.</p>

 <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">Destiny 2: Renegades Content Calendar has been published.</p> <p>We need more time for the roadmap, plain and simple. Expect a true Roadmap, and State of the Game, next year.</p> <p>Again, many apologies. <a href="https://t.co/fw9R49MriX">https://t.co/fw9R49MriX</a> <a href="https://t.co/eKkSURkpjE">pic.twitter.com/eKkSURkpjE</a></p> <p>— dmg04 (@A_dmg04) <a href="https://twitter.com/A_dmg04/status/1989091556884889623?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 13, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <p>The big takeaways? All players will be able to hit the new Power cap just by playing <em>Renegades</em> activities, vault capacity will go up to 1,000 slots to accommodate all the new loot, and all Exotic Armor ornaments can now be swapped between gear of the same class and slot, giving a big boost to <em>Destiny 2</em>‘s fashion meta. The seasonal Dawning, Iron Banner, and Call to Arms events will also be returning. Any lapsed players probably have no idea what to make of Bungie saying stuff like “Vanguard Alerts will bring back some Nightfall vibes,” but long story short: <em>Renegades</em> should hopefully cut a lot of the grindy bullshit <a href="https://kotaku.com/destiny-2-edge-fate-matterspark-kelper-metroid-ball-1851786415">fans faced in <em>Edge of Fate</em> back in July</a>.</p>

 <p>Here’s Bungie’s brief postmortem on what feels like <em>Destiny 2</em>‘s least played, most panned expansion since launch:</p> <blockquote><p>With <em>Edge of Fate,</em> we presented a different vision for the future of <em>Destiny 2</em>’s core game. One intended to refocus our releases and player call-to-action on a familiar but deeper pursuit of Power and ascending to higher Tiers of gear across a wider range of activities supporting customizable challenge and commensurate rewards.</p> <p>Very quickly, the feedback made it clear that this was the wrong path for <em>Destiny</em>.</p> <p>Even if our execution had been perfect, and we see plainly that it was not, it is clear that grinding Power will never be a substitute for earning a trophy. Climbing though throwaway tiers en-route to the gear you want to build around isn’t aspirational. And the Portal itself surrenders too much of <em>Destiny</em>’s feeling of place and exploration. These lessons, and many others besides them, have been taken to heart by our team over the last three months.</p></blockquote> <p>I have no doubt that <a href="https://kotaku.com/bungie-destiny-2-sony-final-shape-playstation-1851077097">Bungie has taken</a> all of the negative feedback to heart. I imagine this has probably been one of the toughest stretches, purely in terms of morale, in the game’s post-launch life. But it remains to be seen if the studio can still engineer a way out of <em>Destiny 2</em>‘s 2025 nosedive. The challenge, as ever, is in how you make doing the same stuff over and over again still feel fresh more than a decade later. Maybe you can’t. Or maybe<em> Destiny 2</em> just needs a humble back-to-basics reboot, at least for its progression and weekly grind. I’m still rooting for it.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/arc-raiders-review-extraction-loot-shooter-embark-2000642198"><i>Arc Raiders</i></a> is dense. That happens to be part of why I love it so much. But there’s no way around it: There’s a lot of stuff to keep track of in this game, from craftable materials, to weapon mods, to the weapons themselves, not to mention quick use items and your augments and shields. It feels endless sometimes–especially given that we so often interface with them one item at a time while we pick ‘em outta random bins or lockers we’ve broken into, or scavenge them from the innards of mechanical menaces we’ve shot down (or biological ones).</p> <p>That’s where cheat sheets and other resources come in. <i>Arc Raiders</i> has been out for a couple of weeks and already there are a bunch of fantastic user-made tools out there.</p> <p>Whether your preference is for images, spreadsheets, or websites, I’ve tracked down a few impressive and wildly useful resources to help you break down the game. Some of these address very specific parts of the sandbox of <i>Arc Raiders</i>’ toys, while others are more comprehensive. Let’s take a look.</p>

 <h2><i>Arc Raiders </i>Database: The GOAT</h2> <p>Let’s kick things off with what I think is currently the best third-party resource for looking up info and tracking your progress as you collect your way to supremacy. Enter <a href="https://ardb.tools/"><i>Arc Raiders</i> Database</a>. Ardb.tools really is a one-stop shop for details on just about any item, map, and even enemy you’d need information about. Looking for a specific resource? Each item gets its own page, complete with all the info you need including locations on each map where you might be likely to find it. You can also directly compare the stats of guns and their various upgrade tiers. It rocks.</p>

 <p>There’s not much else I can say about it other than to encourage you to head on over and start clicking around. The tricky thing with these websites is that they’re only as good as their information is relevant, and as a live-service game, <i>Arc Raiders</i> is a moving target for these kinds of projects. But for now at least,</p>

 <p>this is perhaps the most comprehensive and thorough third-party resource for <i>Arc Raiders</i> thus far, and I also think its UI is very well done. Bookmark it; let it live on a second screen, or use it on your smartphone.</p> <h2>A more comprehensive weapon breakdown</h2> <p>As I said in <a href="https://kotaku.com/arc-raiders-guns-blue-green-purple-gold-best-2000644142">my weapons overview</a>, <i>Arc Raiders</i> is a tricky game to figure out metas for. There are so many ways to enter and leave a match, and so many ways to get into or out of trouble, that simple DPS or TTK stats only give you one part of the picture of an <i>Arc Raiders</i> gun battle.</p>

 <p>But if you want a deep dive, all the way down to headshot multipliers and how many shots it takes to kill someone, have a gander at <a href="https://onedrive.live.com/personal/4c1e78b900b3bf5d/_layouts/15/Doc.aspx?sourcedoc=%7B9253d3f8-679e-4b41-90be-f4f0e67f74f8%7D&amp;action=default&amp;redeem=aHR0cHM6Ly8xZHJ2Lm1zL3gvYy80YzFlNzhiOTAwYjNiZjVkL0VmalRVNUtlWjBGTGtMNzA4T1pfZFBnQmtXbXRMNW52dS1NLUZvdllUdTRIWFE_ZT1zeVR6WGU&amp;slrid=f660d9a1-f07e-0000-17be-eeccdf68937c&amp;originalPath=aHR0cHM6Ly8xZHJ2Lm1zL3gvYy80YzFlNzhiOTAwYjNiZjVkL0lRRDQwMU9Tbm1kQlM1Qy05UERtZjNUNEFaRnByUy1aNzd2alBoYUwyRTd1QjEwP3J0aW1lPWNQemV1YlVqM2tn&amp;CID=e5a5ee82-eb40-4380-a467-656d8059d225&amp;_SRM=0:G:39">the Anvil Community’s Weapon Metrics spreadsheet</a>.</p> <p>As an .xlsx, you can even download the <a href="http://spreadsheet.it/">spreadsheet</a>. Clearly, it will work better in Excel or Microsoft’s live office tools. I’ve been able to download it and add it to my Google Drive, and it seems to work alright. The tabs on the bottom of the page refer to shield strength, so it will recalculate TTKs based on what your target is potentially wearing.</p>

 <p>This information might be wildly subject to change given <i>Arc Raiders</i>’ live-service nature, but for now, it’s one of the only ways to drill down to specifics such as headshot multiplayers and specific numbers of shots-to-kill.</p> <h2>Just the crafting resources</h2> <p>Two resources stood out to me when considering a cheat sheet focused entirely on resources (in addition to the excellent PDF/PNG cheat sheet I shouted out in <a href="https://kotaku.com/arc-raiders-inventory-full-stash-loadout-crafting-cheat-sheet-2000643629">my inventory management guide</a>).</p>

 <p>First up is the humbly named “<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ArcRaiders/comments/1owy9dm/scrap_spreadsheet/">Scrap” Google spreadsheet</a>, created <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ArcRaiders/comments/1owy9dm/scrap_spreadsheet/">by Redditor s1munsayz</a>. This is a very simple spreadsheet laying out all of the crafting resources you can recover, with a simple layout of what they can be recycled/salvaged into. Resources like ARDB are amazing, but a straightforward spreadsheet is sometimes a better visual learning aid.</p> <p>Be sure to make your own copy in your Google Drive to use its search functions appropriately.</p> <p>I also want to shout out <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ArcRaiders/comments/1otpx0o/inventory_manager_manage_your_inventory_easier/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button">Redditor Legal_Squash_195’s</a> “Inventory Manager,” a standalone Python app you can <a href="https://github.com/dev-boog/Arc-Raiders-Inventory-Manager">download from Github</a>. You’ll need to have Python installed on your machine to get it to work, but it’s a handy app–and if you’re like me and enjoy a good standalone, community-created piece of software, Inventory Manager is pretty awesome.</p>

 <h2>Honorable mention: arcraiders.wiki</h2> <p>While I think ARDB takes the cake with its vast amount of options, <a href="https://arcraiders.wiki/">arcraiders.wiki</a> was an early resource for me and it remains a solid way to sort through and look up the nature of various crafting materials, weapons, enemies, and maps.</p> <hr> <p>Time will tell how useful these resources remain over time, especially as <i>Arc Raiders</i> continues to get updates and potential changes to its meta math under the hood. For now, bookmark, download, do whatever you need to, because having these resources at the ready dramatically improves the overall flow of a healthy session of <i>Arc Raiders</i>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><p>
                  Some former Telltale devs were excited to work on the stealth franchise, but it eventually became <i>XDefiant</i>
                </p><div>
              
              <p data-component="paragraph">In 2017, some former Telltale developers were working on a <em>Splinter Cell</em> sequel that eventually, due to Ubisoft’s focus on live-service games, morphed into the now-dead free-to-play FPS<em> XDefiant.</em></p> <p data-component="paragraph"><a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2025-11-14/the-turbulent-seven-year-saga-behind-hit-game-dispatch?accessToken=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJzb3VyY2UiOiJTdWJzY3JpYmVyR2lmdGVkQXJ0aWNsZSIsImlhdCI6MTc2MzE0MzM2NiwiZXhwIjoxNzYzNzQ4MTY2LCJhcnRpY2xlSWQiOiJUNVFBMDdHUEZIUlYwMCIsImJjb25uZWN0SWQiOiJCMUVBQkI5NjQ2QUM0REZFQTJBRkI4MjI1MzgyQTJFQSJ9.fNOncm0D1BfbWI9RAgwCB6j8SI8mW9RhRD76EEz1TYo&amp;leadSource=uverify%20wall">In a <em>Bloomberg</em> story published on November 14</a> about the development of the recently released narrative-focused superhero adventure game <em>Dispatch</em>, we learn a little bit about a previously unknown-to-the-public <em>Splinter Cell</em> game that was being developed by Ubisoft San Francisco around eight years ago.</p>

 <p data-component="paragraph">Adhoc Co-Founder Nick Herman told <em>Bloomberg</em> that in early 2017, he and a few colleagues left Telltale after working on <em>Tales from the Borderlands</em> and landed at Ubisoft San Francisco. They were tasked with developing a new entry in the tactical stealth franchise, <em>Splinter Cell.</em> At that point, it had been about four years since the last game, <a href="https://kotaku.com/splinter-cell-blacklist-the-kotaku-review-1126859452"><em>Blacklist</em>, had been released in 2013</a>.</p>

 <p data-component="paragraph">“I was so excited to be a part of this and help revitalize it, because it’s been dormant for a while,” Herman told the outlet. “And we thought we could tell a great story and do something the fans would love.”</p> <p data-component="paragraph">However, after working on the new <em>Splinter Cell</em> sequel for a few months, Ubisoft executives started disrupting development. This was when the publisher was becoming more and more focused on live-service games that could be updated for years and years, like <em>Rainbow Six Siege </em>and <em>The Division 2. </em>Ubisoft reportedly wanted all of its in-development games to include live-service elements and monetization, including the new <em>Splinter Cell.&nbsp;</em></p>

 <p data-component="paragraph">“We tried,” Herman told <em>Bloomberg</em>. “Let’s make a narrative [live-service] game. We were trying to make that make sense, and a lot of cool prototypes were made.” But it apparently became clear to those working on the doomed game that Ubisoft was no longer interested in <em>Splinter Cell.&nbsp;</em>According to<em> Bloomberg</em> and Herman, the project changed and evolved many times, and eventually became <a href="https://kotaku.com/ubisoft-xdefiant-shut-down-ending-call-of-duty-cod-june-1851712899"><em>XDefiant,</em> aka that short-lived live-service shooter Ubisoft killed back in June.&nbsp;</a></p> <p>“It was exciting to go to work for the first six months because we thought we were going to be able to make something really great,” Herman said. “And then you realize that all of the things you care about, they don’t anymore. It’s a common thing in games.”</p> <p>Ubisoft hasn’t completely given up on <em>Splinter Cell. </em><a href="https://kotaku.com/new-splinter-cell-trailer-netflix-deathwatch-chaos-theory-ending-john-wick-2000626077">There’s an animated series that recently arrived on Netflix</a> that I’m guessing you didn’t know about. And <a href="https://news.ubisoft.com/en-us/article/4adJLuhgYrPboHAPRfK7Oz/splinter-cell-remake-begins-development-at-ubisoft-toronto">in 2021, the company confirmed Ubisoft Toronto was developing a remake</a> of the first game. We’ve not heard much about that project since it was first revealed. Hopefully, it doesn’t morph into some <em>Call of Duty</em> clone.</p>
