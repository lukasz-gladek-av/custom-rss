              <p>A good business (or work) laptop should ideally be portable, reliable, and fast enough to deal with everything your busy days throw at it. However, most laptops that check these boxes usually cost a ton, but that changes today.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5104/">Amazon is being generous with a limited-time deal on the 17-inch HP business laptop, now available for just $700 after a massive 75% discount</a>. That’s $2,100 off the original price, which is hard to ignore if you’ve been meaning to treat yourself to a powerful upgrade without blowing your budget. And as if that wasn’t enough, you also get an accessory bundle thrown in for absolutely free!</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5104/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Run Multiple Applications Without Slowdowns</h2>
<p>The power this laptop packs is more than enough to handle resource-intensive apps and creative projects without slowing down. This is made possible with a 10-core Intel i5-1334U processor that can boost up to 4.6GHz for fast speeds, plus the 16GB of DDR4 RAM that makes it easy to work on multiple projects at once. If your productive days involve some serious multitasking, you’re surely going to appreciate how this laptop makes it easy to power through without frustrating lags.</p>
<p>Storage is taken care of by a 512GB SSD that gets you both fast startup times and ample file storage. It’s not massive, but it should be enough to house your important work files, plus media content like photos, videos, and even a bunch of movies.</p>



<p>The display gives you bright, vivid visuals with its 17.3-inch HD+ BrightView screen. It’s also quite easy on the eyes, whether you’re working in a dim setting or by a bright window. You won’t be left with eye strain at the end of a long day.</p>
<p>Connectivity-wise, you’re covered with Wi-Fi 6 and Bluetooth 5.4, plus a range of ports like 2 USB-A ports, 1 USB-C, HDMI 2.1, and a headphone/mic combo jack. And finally, the free accessory bundle includes a wireless silent mouse, a USB hub, a 128GB USB flash drive, a 7-in-1 cleaning kit, and Windows 11 Pro (pre-installed). All of that is valued at $199, but it’s included here for free. Just keep in mind the accessory pack is shipped separately, so don’t panic if it doesn’t arrive in the same box as the laptop.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5104/">There’s a lot more to like about this laptop, especially now that it’s going at a discount.</a> The offer won’t last long, so it’s best to jump in on it while there’s still time.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/ankers-12-in-1-docking-station-goes-for-pennies-and-it-works-as-a-monitor-stand-too-2000640096</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/anker%E2%80%99s-12-in-1-docking-station-goes-for-pennies-and-it-works-as-a-monitor-stand-too.1339084/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Desk cable management is one of those daily frustrations that slowly chips away at your sanity. You’ve got charging cables snaking across the surface, USB dongles competing for space, and that eternal question of where to actually put your keyboard when you need more room to work. The Anker 675 USB-C docking station tackles this chaos head-on by <strong>combining a monitor stand with a full-featured 12-in-1 hub</strong> that keeps everything connected and organized in one sleek package. Right now, Amazon has dropped this <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5119/">award-winning workspace solution to an all-time low of $169, down from its usual $249 price tag</a>, and this early Black Friday deal deserves your attention if you’re tired of wrestling with desk clutter.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5119/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<p>The brilliance of this design is in how it turns wasted vertical space into useful storage: Instead of <strong>your monitor resting directly on the desk, the Anker docking station lifts it by 3.54 inches</strong>. This creates the ideal space underneath for your keyboard, laptop, or other accessories you want close but out of sight. This height adjustment not only looks neat but it also raises your screen to eye level. This helps you keep better posture throughout your workday instead of leaning forward and straining your neck. The <strong>unit measures 21.26 inches long and 8.66 inches deep</strong>, and provides ample surface area to support monitors weighing up to 22 pounds.</p>
<h2>Twelve Ports That Actually Matter</h2>
<p>The port selection on the Anker device includes everything you need for a modern workspace without cluttering it with unnecessary connections: The <strong>single USB-C upstream port</strong> on the underside connects to your laptop and supports up to <strong>100W of Power Delivery</strong>. This means it can charge even power-hungry laptops like the MacBook Pro or Dell laptop while managing all your peripherals through one cable.<strong> Two additional USB-C ports on the side share 45W of Power Delivery</strong> between them. They operate at 10Gbps transfer speeds which makes it easy to move large files or back up photos quickly. The<strong> three USB-A ports also run at 10Gbps</strong> with one port providing 7.5W for charging and another offering 4.5W.</p>



<p>The <strong>4K HDMI port</strong> supports resolutions up to 3840 x 2160 at 60Hz, delivering clear visuals for everything from spreadsheet work to photo editing. You’ll need to use this HDMI connection for external displays since the USB-C ports do not support video output, so keep that in mind as you plan your setup. The <strong>SD and microSD card slots</strong> both support UHS-I speeds up to 104MB/s which makes them quick enough for photographers who regularly transfer RAW files. An Ethernet port provides gigabit speeds for wired internet connections. The <strong>3.5mm combo audio jack</strong> handles both input and output for headphones or external speakers.</p>
<p>The <strong>wireless charging pad</strong> in the top right corner delivers 10W for compatible Android devices and 7.5W for iPhones: This matches the output of most standalone Qi chargers. This feature clears another cable from your desk and keeps your phone visible and accessible throughout the day. The pad works reliably even with phone cases on, so you won’t have to remove your device every time you want to recharge the battery.</p>



<p>The<strong> included 180W power supply</strong> provides enough energy to run the entire unit, allowing full charging speeds to your laptop while powering all connected peripherals at the same time. Setup takes just minutes since everything is plug-and-play with Windows, macOS, and Chrome OS systems. The aluminum alloy construction gives the unit a high-quality feel and matches well with modern office equipment.</p>
<p>This docking station won a <em>CES 2023 Innovation Award</em> for a good reason: It addresses multiple workspace problems in one product instead of forcing you to piece together separate solutions. At the current sale price of $169, you save a lot of money compared to buying a quality monitor stand and a similar USB-C hub separately.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Mario has been a classic for decades, and it’s loved by quite literally just about everyone, no matter their age. The franchise goes back to the early 1980s when Mario made his first appearance in Donkey Kong as the Jump Man before getting his own game, Super Mario Bros., in 1985. Since then, he’s become one of the most beloved video game characters, and you can now bring his adventures home with the Super Mario Kart 8 anti-gravity mini RC racer by Nintendo for less.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5103/">On a regular day, it would run you around $40, but today, you can snag it up for just $30 on Amazon after a nice $10 discount</a>. It’s a great pick for some early holiday shopping, but the deal won’t last long. The set was already quite affordable at $40, but the current discount makes it an even better pick.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5103/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Two Super Fun Racing Modes</h2>
<p>The kart has a good size and weight. It’s light for kids to carry around easily, but still sturdy enough to take a few bumps. There are two racing modes; standard and anti-gravity mode. The standard mode lets kids race around like a regular RC car, while the anti-gravity mode flips the wheels to perform drifts and tricks. It can even pull off 360-degree spins and wheelies! Switching between both modes is simple and just takes a single press of a button.</p>
<p>The racer runs on a 2.4GHz remote, which gives you a range of up to 100 feet. To give you an idea, that’s enough to race around your living room without slowdowns. The remote is also easy to use, so your kids will be showing off cool stunts and zipping through complicated spots in no time.</p>



<p>It’s designed for ages 8 and up, but we won’t judge if you feel the need to jump in and take a few laps yourself. Mario Kart is for everyone!</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5103/">This deal brings the price down of this already-affordable Super Mario Kart 8 anti-gravity mini RC racer to just $30.</a> It’s practically a steal, and also a great chance to grab more than one if you have multiple young players at home. That way, everyone gets their own kart to race and show off without running to you every two minutes. Just be sure to hurry before the offer wraps up for good!</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Apple’s New 11-Inch M5 iPad Pro Is Already Cheaper on Amazon, a Subtle Pre-Black Friday Surprise]]></title>
            <link>https://kotaku.com/apples-new-11-inch-m5-ipad-pro-is-already-cheaper-on-amazon-a-subtle-pre-black-friday-surprise-2000639857</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/apple%E2%80%99s-new-11-inch-m5-ipad-pro-is-already-cheaper-on-amazon-a-subtle-pre-black-friday-surprise.1339060/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>When the&nbsp;<em>really</em> big sales events of the year get close — Black Friday, Cyber Monday, Amazon Prime Day, etc., one of the big questions is always “What’s Apple going to do?” If this new Amazon deal on the brand-new M5 iPad Pro is any indication, <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5102/">Apple’s going to be dipping at least a toe in the Black Friday pond in the weeks to come. For the first time, the 11-inch M5 iPad Pro is taking a price drop — it’s $949 right now, down by $50.</a></p>
<p>Apple fans and creative pros in particular are going to be all over this one, because the new M5 iPad Pro comes closer to full high-end laptop power than any tablet yet. The M5 chip is a game changer in terms of speed and pure power, and the newly released iPadOS 26 is a massive leap forward. The two combine with Apple Intelligence to create a tablet that can do nearly everything a powerful laptop can, especially if you add the Magic Keyboard to complete the experience.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5102/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Faster, Thinner, Better</h2>
<p>Strangely enough, the new IPad Pro is lighter than the iPad Air — 0.98 pounds, which speaks to just how much size and weight Apple has cut from their latest tablet design while amping up its power and ability. The M5 chip gets the lion’s share of attention, and deservedly so, but don’t sleep on the N1 wireless chip that’s also in the new iPad Pro, because it makes Wi-Fi 7, Thread, and Bluetooth 6 connections happen.</p>
<p>As with all things Apple, the screen on the M5 iPad Pro is best-in-class. It’s an Ultra Retina XDR tandem OLED screen with anti-glare treatment and an oleophobic coating that cuts down on fingerprints — an essential feature for an elite tablet. The ProMotion adaptive refresh rate ranges from 10Hz to a blistering 120Hz, and the peak performance of 1,600 nits delivers all of the exceptional quality of the screen in its full glory.</p>



<h2>All About the Images</h2>
<p>The M5 iPad Pro’s cameras and what it can do with the images are where this tablet really shines. The 12MP Wide camera at the rear of the tablet can shoot 4K ProRes video, and also be used as a powerful document scanner and AR code unlocking device. The front of the tablet has a powerhouse 12MP landscape Center Stage camera for pristine video calls and conferencing. When you shoot your videos or stills, Apple Intelligence takes over to deliver the best and most powerful range of editing and creative options of any tablet on the market.’</p>
<p>The first price break on this brand-new tablet is definitely an occasion, even if it’s just 5%. That might not be the case with other tablets, <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5102/">but the M5 iPad Pro was a&nbsp;<em>lot</em> of tablet at its full $999 price, and now that it’s down to $949 at Amazon, it’s a more impressive deal yet.&nbsp;</a></p>
