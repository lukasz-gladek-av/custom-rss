            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://kotaku.com/pokemon-tcg-pocket-marvel-snap-rewards-card-1851686837<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>  <em>Pokémon TCG Pocket</em> arrived this week on iPhone and Android, and it’s a surprisingly crisp and streamlined version of the card game after years of really bad alternatives. <em>Pokémon</em> is pretty much a license to print money, but <em>TCG Pocket</em> does a great job of spotlighting what people love about about the game—the cards themselves—and getting most of the other stuff out of the way. Still, as a big fan of Marvel Snap, there are a few things I wish the mobile game would steal from Second Dinner’s 2022 comic book phenomenon. </p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="192873" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="The Week In Games: Pocket Monsters And Simulated Goats" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="133" data-playlist="192873,196165,196578" data-current="192873"><div><p>The Week In Games: Pocket Monsters And Simulated Goats</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/192873/192873_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/192873/192873_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/192873/192873_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/192873/192873_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/18337.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>I’ve been spending most of my idle smartphone moments the past two days playing <em>Pokémon TCG Pocket</em> instead of doom scrolling Twitter or <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.404media.co/zuckerberg-the-ai-slop-will-continue-until-morale-improves/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.404media.co/zuckerberg-the-ai-slop-will-continue-until-morale-improves/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">ingesting AI-slop on Instagram</a></span>, which is exactly what I want from a good, daily grind  mobile game. All of the currencies and sub-economies aimed at getting you to spend money on the otherwise free-to-play game are a bit convoluted and hard to parse, but the battles are fun and opening virtual booster packs by slicing wrappers with a finger swipe is a surprisingly effective simulacrum of the pure joys of doing so in real life. </p><p>I’m not yet as obsessed with <em>Pokémon TCG Pocket</em> as I was with Marvel Snap, however, and I think there are three reasons for that. The first is match length. Marvel Snap battles breeze by, making it feel relatively low-stakes to start up another no matter what’s going on around you. <em>TCG Pocket</em> is a bit more involved. Players have a cumulative timer of 20 minutes, with countdowns starting at over 60 seconds for individual turns. The clock rarely gets milked, but matches can still feel a little drawn out as players stack their benches and build up their Pokémon’s power. More than once I’ve finished a match and thought, “That was neat but do I really have time for another.” </p><p>The second thing holding <em>Pokémon TCG Pocket </em>back a little for me are the match rewards. In addition to bite-sized matches, <em>Marvel Snap</em> has an ingenious progression built around acquiring extra cards  to level them up and earn points that can be spent on acquiring new ones. It’s a clever twist on the traditional booster pack RNG formula. <em>TCG Pocket</em>, as an adaptation of an existing card game, doesn’t have that same luxury. Unfortunately, as things stand, the only rewards for winning matches are miniscule amounts of XP that contribute to an overall level. Raising it nets additional rewards but none of them feel very distinct. The result is that finishing matches feels a bit anti-climactic, rather than giving out that dopamine hit that makes you immediately want to play another match.</p><p>Finally, there’s the cards themselves. Outside of building your collection, Marvel Snap has the secondary goal of acquiring, sometimes by outright purchasing, cool alternate card art for your favorite decks. It provides something else to strive for as well as a way to express your particular flavor of popular deck type. Again, <em>TCG Pocket</em> runs into trouble here because its working off of existing card art, and while there are multiple versions of certain cards to unlock, there aren’t many, and there’s no real way to chase them directly. If you open a pack and get a full art variant, great! If not, well, wait for the next random pull. </p><p>It’s still early and <em>TCG Pocket</em> is otherwise doing a lot right, certainly more than probably every other digital version of the <em>Pokémon </em>card game I’ve played in the past. There’s only one set of cards to collect at the moment and not much eye candy to salivate over in the paid in-game store. I’m sure that will all change soon enough but for now the game hasn’t quite conjured the full magic of my early days with <em>Marvel Snap</em>. Maybe that’s for the best. I eventually had to delete that game from my phone because it was consuming way too much of my free time.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Told through narration, <em>The Lake House</em> recounts Estevez’s investigation into the titular location, an FBC facility that has gone dark. Like <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/alan-wake-2-night-springs-review-dlc-1851583087&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/alan-wake-2-night-springs-review-dlc-1851583087"><em>Night Springs</em></a></span>, the first of <em>AW2</em>’s expansions, <em>The Lake House</em> is a bite-sized experience that will take you only two to three hours to complete. That’s perfect, as it lets Remedy tell a more concise story with a clear point of view.</p><p>Despite being more closely connected to 2019’s <em>Control </em>than anything else in <em>AW2</em>, don’t expect <em>The Lake House</em> to play like that supernatural action game. Estevez isn’t packing special powers, just a pistol and a flashlight. As in the base game, you’ll collect a few more weapons along the way (including an entirely new armament) to fight off the now-infected inhabitants of the Lake House. As a conclusion to the AW2 experience, <em>The Lake House</em> clearly wants to challenge you, boasting some tough fights against large groups of enemies made even tougher by a seemingly abysmal amount of resources throughout the facility. If you aren’t careful, you’ll find yourself with an empty clip and no other option than to face your inevitable death and restart with a better plan. </p><figure id="" data-id="788e398a26370b05865facf6924b2149" data-recommend-id="image://788e398a26370b05865facf6924b2149" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="728" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A government agent points a gun and flashlight at a large paint monster" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A government agent points a gun and flashlight at a large paint monster" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Remedy Entertainment</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="788e398a26370b05865facf6924b2149" data-recommend-id="image://788e398a26370b05865facf6924b2149" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="728" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A government agent points a gun and flashlight at a large paint monster" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>The expansion’s titular facility gives <em>The Lake House</em> its own aesthetic identity, one that’s far more in line with <em>Control</em>. This is an FBC building, after all, and as soon as you walk inside its concrete lobby, the sleek brutalist architecture might almost make you feel like you’re back in the Oldest House. The enemies you encounter within the facility, like the weapons you find, are mostly rehashes of what you saw in the base game, a bunch of zombie-like figures who’ve been infected by the Dark Place. There is, however, something else lurking within the Lake House: looming humanoid figures dripping with paint that jump out of canvases to kill you. The Lake House itself is decorated with countless paintings and graffiti across its walls (alongside lots of blood).</p><p>The physical art you encounter around every corner in the Lake House represents the facility’s (and the expansion’s) continued obsession with the artistic process. Unlike Wake himself, and many other important figures in the extended lore of the series, the major players in <em>The Lake House </em>are not artists themselves, yet they are preoccupied with the production of it. The competing co-heads of the facility, whose story <em>The Lake House </em>truly is, conducted experiments in an effort to harness Wake’s ability to reshape reality through art, a path which ultimately plunged the building into chaos.</p><p>As you explore the levels of the Lake House, you’ll read emails and memos about two dueling projects, both of which seek to quantify the emotion of an artistic piece in some objective manner that can then be replicated. One researcher attempts this by dragging in a painter and forcing him to adhere to an inhuman production schedule to create the correct art for triggering a supernatural power like Wake’s. The opposing project believed that it could recreate the outcome of Wake’s writing through observation, measurement, and replication.</p><figure id="" data-id="c3ec9b8a73c4bf9be8fe452607142845" data-recommend-id="image://c3ec9b8a73c4bf9be8fe452607142845" data-format="jpg" data-width="825" data-height="464" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A government agent points her flashlight at a row of automated typewriters" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A government agent points her flashlight at a row of automated typewriters" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Remedy Entertainment</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="c3ec9b8a73c4bf9be8fe452607142845" data-recommend-id="image://c3ec9b8a73c4bf9be8fe452607142845" data-format="jpg" data-width="825" data-height="464" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A government agent points her flashlight at a row of automated typewriters" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>One of the most striking environments in <em>The Lake House</em> is a sprawling open office filled with dozens—maybe hundreds—of automated typewriters trained on pages written by Wake that the FBC recovered. The mechanical whirring of machines and cacophonous clicking of keys produces countless pages of text. In a room off to the side you can find a white board on which researchers graded each resulting page on metrics like tone, style, readability, etc. There is a constant desire to define what makes something “art.”</p><p>It’s a not-at-all subtle takedown of artificial intelligence in tech, specifically products like <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/microsoft-openai-sam-altman-twitch-emmett-shear-1851035956&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/microsoft-openai-sam-altman-twitch-emmett-shear-1851035956">ChatGPT</a></span> that scrape the work of real creators in order to produce empty facsimiles of art that impress only the most unimaginative people. Remedy beats you over the head with the sheer stupidity of both the Lake House experiments and their real-life counterparts. Signs plastered on the walls encourage workers to not decorate their desks and remind them that “art is for analysis.” At one point, a page written by Wake describing the projects within the Lake House reads “art was not art, just content for the experiment.”</p><p><br>That’s <em>Alan Wake 2</em>’s final message to audiences. Art is not content. It’s a word that’s become so much more prolific across cultural discussions in recent years as the proponents of AI push us toward conceiving of every piece of art as simply a product for viewer enjoyment rather than a thing that can challenge your worldview. Games are not content. Writing is not content. Art is not content. Those who create are not cogs in a machine to be used and disposed of or turned into food for an algorithm. <em>The Lake House</em> is Remedy’s clear statement that the push to quantify and replicate art without emotion is nothing short of a horror story. As far as farewells go, it’s a pretty fucking good one. </p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

We’re predicting an equally messy November, with masters Denzel Washington and Hugh Grant returning with <em>Gladiator 2</em> and <em>Heretic</em> respectively, and controversial combat athletes Jake Paul, Mike Tyson, and Jon Jones drawing eyes to Netflix and ESPN+.</p><p>There are lots of big swings coming this month, so there will certainly be some misses that’ll make headlines. Read on to see which movies, shows, and sporting events we think will be worth talking about throughout November.<br></p></div></div><div><p>WWE returns to Riyadh, Saudi Arabia this month with Crown Jewel. Fans will be excited to learn that Braun Strowman, Drew McIntyre, and Becky Lynch are expected to return to the ring during the PLE.

Set in the utopian Piltover, <em>Arcane </em>is an adult-themed steampunk adventure series lovingly crafted under the careful supervision of Riot Games.</p><p>The first season aired in November 2021, and fans have eagerly awaited more. Well, the wait’s nearly over. <em>Arcane </em>season 2 airs on November 6, exclusively on Netflix.</p></div><div><p>Amazon Prime is quickly becoming one of the best streaming services for original series, boasting the likes of <em>Fallout </em>and <em>Rings of Power</em>. But they also publish lesser-known titles that often fly under the radar. One such show, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.primevideo.com/detail/0KYRVT4JDB957NXZO72E2MIFW5&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.primevideo.com/detail/0KYRVT4JDB957NXZO72E2MIFW5" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>Citadel: Honey Bunny</em></a></span>, is an upcoming Indian spy action spin-off of <em>Citadel</em>, and it promises action and intrigue around every corner.</p><p>Starring Varun Dhawan as Agent Bunny and Samantha Ruth Prabhu as Agent Honey, <em>Citadel: Honey Bunny</em> tells the story of a stuntman and struggling actress who unwittingly enter the world of espionage in a series of events that cascade years later.</p></div><div><p><em>Heretic</em>, starring Hugh Grant, Sophie Thatcher, Chloe East, and Topher Grace, follows two Mormon missionaries as they spread the word of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. They stumble upon a Scottish man, Mr. Reed, who has other intentions in mind. Their chance encounter quickly turns into a game of cat and mouse as the two young missionaries find themselves locked away in his domain, struggling for survival as their faith comes into question.</p><p>From early reviews, it seems <em>Heretic </em>is an eerie offering by A24 that’s on track to be the horror movie of the latter half of the year.</p></div><div><p>It’s a bit early for Christmas, but <em>Red One</em> doesn’t mind one bit. This unique take on the usual Santa Claus and holiday story features Dwayne Johnson, Chris Evans, Lucy Liu, and J.K. Simmons. In Red One, Santa Claus is kidnapped, and the North Pole’s head of security, played by Johnson, teams up with a world-renowned bounty hunter to track down the mythical man himself. From there, it’s a comedy rife with action as the two delve into a globe-spanning adventure.</p><p>Did we mention the giant, terrifying snowmen with razor-sharp teeth? Yeah, they pose a problem in the movie.<br></p></div><div><p>It’s been a long time coming. It feels like the initial boxing match between renowned champion Mike Tyson and YouTuber-turned-boxer Jake Paul was announced ages ago. Yet, after a buildup that has felt longer than the 31-year age difference between both fighters, the fight that no one asked for is finally happening.</p><p>On November 15, streaming exclusively on Netflix from the AT&amp;T Stadium in Arlington, Texas, <em>Mike Tyson v. Jake Paul</em> goes down once and for all. Both fighters have spent the past few months training and preparing. It’s tough to say who will come out on top…or is it?</p></div><div><p>Based on the exceptional book series by author Hugh Howey, <em>Silo </em>tells the story of a post-apocalyptic future in which communities exist underground, nestled in a silo that reaches hundreds of stories into the earth. It’s there that society has been reformed with rules meant to keep everyone safe from whatever lies above the surface. However, down below, intrigue runs even deeper than the silo does. An engineer, Juliette, played by <em>Dune</em>’s Rebecca Ferguson, must uncover the mystery surrounding a colleague’s untimely death, which reveals more about their new world than expected.</p></div><div><p>For everyone who grew up on the <em>Karate Kid</em> in the 1980s, the return of the All Valley Karate Tournament and Johnny Lawrence came as a godsend in <em>Cobra Kai</em>. The series, available to watch exclusively on Netflix, quickly became a fan favorite, spawning multiple seasons over the years.</p><p>Did you know we’re up to season six of <em>Cobra Kai</em>? It’s true! This latest season of the action series is split into three parts of five episodes each. The first part aired in July, the second will begin on November 15, and the final five episodes air sometime in 2025.</p></div><div><p>On November 16, UFC returns with UFC 309: Jones vs. Miocic, taking place at Madison Square Garden and streaming live on ESPN+.

Although it feels like it’s snuck up on us in the busy month of November, <em>Dune: Prophecy </em>promises to expand upon the long-running universe by author Brian Herbert and is worth adding to your watchlist.</p><p>The sci-fi series occurs 10,000 years before the films and follows members of the Sisterhood, namely Emily Watson’s “Valya Harkonnen” and Olivia Williams’s “Tula Harkonnen,” as they face off against mysterious forces that threaten the balance of the entire star system.<br></p><p>By the way, Mark Strong plays Emperor Corrino, and that’s an easy win in our book!<br></p></div><div><p>With <em>Gladiator 2’s</em> star-studded cast, which includes Denzel Washington, Pedro Pascal, and Connie Nielsen, it’s unbelievable to think there’s any controversy surrounding the film.
