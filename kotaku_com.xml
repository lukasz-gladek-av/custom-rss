              <p>Every version of the PlayStation 5 <a href="https://kotaku.com/ps5-console-price-increase-sony-america-august-21-2000618873">is now $50 more expensive</a> in the U.S., but at least for now, a new deal at GameStop will cover the difference. The meme stock retailer announced it will start giving anyone who trades in their last-gen consoles an extra $50 in-store credit toward the purchase of a new PS5.</p> <p>This deal applies to anyone trading in an old PS4, Xbox Series X/S, Xbox One, or Nintendo Switch. If you really want a PS5, it‚Äôs better than nothing. The all-digital edition, the cheapest Sony offers, is now $500 starting August 21. So instead of just getting $55 toward that from trading in a PS4, you‚Äôll get $110. An Xbox One currently trades for about $45, so just $95 total. The Switch isn‚Äôt much better. You‚Äôll only get $60 for it before the new bonus credit, even though Nintendo recently raised the price of a new one to $340.</p> <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">‚ÄúOffer valid through 8.23.25‚Äù is in such small print at the bottom lol</p> <p>GameStop only has your back for a few days üíÄ</p> <p>‚Äî Carlton (@carlton_ec08) <a href="https://twitter.com/carlton_ec08/status/1958345035302240471?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">August 21, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <p>Xbox Series X/S owners looking to move over to PlayStation will have it a little easier. A Series S, now sold new at $370, will still get you up to $176, while a Series X, sold for $600, will get you up to $300. I could see taking that. When it comes to the other consoles, the price difference is harder to swallow. GameStop also buries in the fine print that this <a href="https://kotaku.com/ps5-gta-6-price-switch-2-trump-tariff-2000618881">bonus Trump tariff credit</a> will only be active through August 23.</p> <p>Is it better than nothing? Sure! But it still lowkey sucks in the worst way. This whole thing is basically GameStop saying, ‚ÄúReckless trade policy has hiked the price of a PS5, so here‚Äôs a bonus credit for these already terrible trade-in values that you‚Äôll have to give right back to us.‚Äù GameStop‚Äôs edgelord CEO Ryan Cohen, despite being Canadian, has been <a href="https://twitter.com/MattBinder/status/1908538518919323827">a big booster</a> of Trump, even as the president rolled out the current tariff regime earlier this year. His Elon Musk-lite impression included using the sale of GameStop‚Äôs Canadian operation <a href="https://fortune.com/2025/02/19/gamestop-selling-canadian-french-operations-stores-ryan-cohen-wokeness-dei/">to dunk on DEI policies</a>. He‚Äôs currently <a href="https://kotaku.com/gamestop-bitcoin-half-a-billion-500-million-meme-stock-1851782733">using GameStop to buy billions in Bitcoin</a>.</p>
