              <p>Amazon keeps its prices low on Alexa-enabled speakers all year long and the <strong>Echo Dot is a great choice because it is in the middle of the lineup</strong> between basic and premium options. This model is the best-selling one in the Echo family <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4514/">right now, and it’s only $31 instead of the usual $49 for early December</a>. The small speaker has surprisingly rich sound that fills bedrooms, offices, or dining rooms without taking up too much counter space or needing a lot of setup.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4514/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Why This Echo Dot Sounds Better Than You Thought</h2>
<p>The speaker design is all about making the sound fuller and giving it more bass than previous Echo Dot models could do with their small enclosures. Amazon changed the way the internal drivers are set up so that they can comfortably fill small to medium-sized rooms with sound while playing music, listening to podcasts, or reading audiobooks. The sound quality isn’t good enough to replace dedicated speakers for critical listening, but it does a good job with background music, news briefings, and alarm sounds, making the Echo Dot useful for more than just voice commands.</p>



<p><strong>Alexa integration lets you control thousands of smart home devices</strong>, streaming services, and information queries with your voice, so you don’t have to keep taking out your phone: You can change smart lights, thermostats, and plugs by speaking commands naturally. You can also check the weather, set multiple timers while you cook, or ask for unit conversions while you prepare a recipe. The microphone array uses far-field voice recognition technology to filter out background noise and make your voice clear even when music is playing at a moderate volume.</p>
<p>The small size is about the size of a tennis ball, so it doesn’t take up much space on nightstands or desk corners where bigger Echo devices would take up too much space. This size is perfect for bedrooms because it wakes you up with music, news, or soft sounds instead of loud beeps. While you’re getting ready, you can ask Alexa for the time, the weather, or your calendar appointments without touching any devices. The <strong>top surface has physical buttons for turning up the volume</strong>, muting the microphone, and turning on Alexa.</p>



<p>Smart home routines let you set up morning routines that gradually brighten the lights, start your coffee maker, and read your calendar. You can do all of these things with just one command or a scheduled trigger. Evening routines can lock smart locks, change the temperature, turn off all the lights in the house, and play relaxing sounds to help you sleep. You set up these automation sequences in the Alexa app, and they work every time after that.</p>
<p><strong>A physical microphone mute button is part of the privacy controls</strong>: When the button is pressed, the microphones are electronically disconnected. A red light ring shows when the device isn’t listening. The speaker also has options to limit how long data is kept or stop people from listening to recordings</p>
<p>This $18 off makes full Alexa functionality and better sound quality affordable enough to buy Echo Dots for more than one room. If you want to start building a smart home or just need hands-free voice control in important areas, this is a great deal because you get Amazon’s smart assistant platform with room-filling sound for less than the cost of basic Bluetooth speakers.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/one-week-after-black-friday-dyson-v11-quietly-hits-new-record-low-on-amazon-2000651139</link>

              <p>Black Friday came and went, but Amazon continues pushing deals on premium brands throughout December which happens to be its biggest sales month of the year. The <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4478/">Dyson V11 Origin currently sits at $399 instead of its usual $629 which is a record low on this cordless vacuum</a> that brings serious suction power to your cleaning routine.</p>
<p>This <strong>model delivers 185 air watts of power across three modes</strong>, and handles both quick daily cleanups and deep weekend cleaning sessions. Over 40,000 units sold in the past month as people realize Dyson’s engineering justifies the premium over budget stick vacuums that die after six months. The combination of 60-minute runtime, detangling brush head, and HEPA filtration creates a cleaning tool that handles pet hair, allergens, and debris across all floor types.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4478/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>What 185 Air Watts Does to Change Your Cleaning Experience</h2>
<p>The suction power measured in air watts represents actual cleaning capability rather than motor wattage marketing numbers that don’t correlate with performance. This <strong>V11 Origin pulls 60% more power than previous Dyson V-series models</strong>, and creates enough airflow to lift embedded dirt from carpet fibers and pull debris from grout lines in hard flooring. You can feel the difference immediately when vacuuming high-traffic areas where foot traffic grinds dirt deep into carpet pile, as the motorbar cleaner head actually extracts material that cheaper vacuums just push around.</p>



<p><strong>Three power modes</strong> let you clean in different ways without wasting battery on tasks that don’t need full power. Auto mode automatically changes the suction power based on the type of floor and the amount of dirt, balancing cleaning performance with battery life to make it last for years. Eco mode lets you clean your whole house or a large area <strong>for up to 60 minutes at a time</strong>, which is great for when you need to run the device for a long time between charges. Boost mode gives you the most suction for tough spots, dirt that has been ground in, or thick carpets that need more power. The LCD screen shows how much time is left for cleaning, down to the second, as well as power mode and maintenance alerts. This way, you always know how much time you have left.</p>
<p>The <strong>Motorbar cleaner head has a design that keeps long hair and pet fur from getting stuck</strong> in the brush bar: This fixes one of the most annoying things about owning a vacuum. With traditional brush rolls, you have to cut and unwind hair that builds up while you clean. This design, on the other hand, sends hair straight to the dustbin as you vacuum. You can clean rooms with long-haired people or pets that shed without having to stop every few minutes to untangle hair from the brush.</p>



<p>Advanced<strong> whole-machine HEPA filtration catches 99.99% of particles as small as 0.3 microns</strong> including allergens, dust mites, and fine particulate matter that can cause breathing problems. The sealed filtration system keeps particles that have been caught from getting back into your air through cracks or exhaust. This is very important for people with allergies or respiratory issues.</p>
<p>You can <strong>switch to handheld mode in seconds</strong> by taking off the wand and attaching tools directly to the main body and because of this flexibility, you don’t have to get out a separate handheld vacuum for quick cleanups in the car, on the couch, or on the ceiling. The weight and balance are good for handheld use, so you can use it for a long time on stairs or furniture without getting tired in your arms.</p>
<p>This $230 discount makes Dyson’s engineering and build quality comparable to mid-range cordless vacuums that don’t have the same suction power, runtime, or filtration as this model. You’re getting a cleaning tool that will last for years instead of months, and the materials and construction are worth the extra cost compared to disposable-grade options.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/dualsense-chroma-teal-controller-goes-to-record-low-now-cheaper-than-third-party-options-and-seriously-more-stylish-2000651134</link>
            <guid>1375183</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Sony extended Cyber Monday deals through the weekend with record low pricing on various products, and most <em>DualSense</em> controller received discounts. This <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6257/">Chroma Teal model remains in stock at $59 instead of the usual $79</a>, and it’s<strong> moved over 40,000 units in just the past month on Amazon</strong>. The distinctive color adds personality to your gaming setup and delivers the same haptic feedback and adaptive trigger technology that separates PS5 gaming from other platforms.</p>
<p>DualSense controllers transform how games feel by providing tactile sensations that correspond to in-game actions and create immersion that standard vibration motors can’t replicate. The combination of <strong>haptic feedback, adaptive triggers, and built-in audio features</strong> solves the problem of wanting a second controller or replacing a worn-out original without paying full retail price.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6257/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Why haptic feedback is important when you play games</h2>
<p>The haptic feedback system uses advanced actuators to make exact vibrations and sensations that match certain actions and surfaces in the game: You can feel the crunch of gravel under your character’s feet, the patter of rain on surfaces, or the faint vibration of a car engine idling through the controller body. This technology does a lot more than just rumble; it changes the strength, frequency, and location of vibrations to make different textures and impacts. Games made just for the PS5 use these features to make you feel more connected to the virtual world than traditional controllers ever did.</p>



<p>The L2 and R2 buttons on adaptive triggers let you change the amount of resistance, so you need to use different amounts of force depending on what’s happening in the game. As you pull the trigger more, the tension in the bow increases. Adaptive triggers in racing games make the brake pedal feel like it’s pushing back, which gives you feedback on how much grip you have and lets you know when the wheels start to lock up. This dynamic resistance adds a physical element to the game that improves muscle memory and makes actions feel more real.</p>
<p>You don’t need a separate headset to talk to people in-game or at a party because the built-in microphone picks up your voice clearly: The audio quality is fine for casual conversation, but serious streamers or competitive players will still want dedicated microphones for better sound quality and noise isolation. The dedicated mute button is easy to find and use, so you can quickly silence your mic without having to go through menus.</p>



<p>The 3.5mm headphone jack works with any wired gaming headset, so it will work with any audio equipment you already own. With this connection, you can hear game audio and chat at the same time through one cable which means you don’t need separate USB adapters or wireless dongles that drain the battery life of your controller. The sound quality is good enough that you won’t notice any compression or lag which his means you can hear footsteps, directional cues, and dialogue with the timing and clarity that competitive gaming needs.</p>
<p>Depending on how much haptic feedback and adaptive triggers the games use, the battery life usually lasts 8 to 12 hours. If you need to, you can change the system settings to lower the haptic intensity or turn off adaptive triggers to make the battery last longer. However, this means losing the immersive features that make PS5 gaming so great. You can charge the controller with a USB-C cable that connects to the console or any standard USB charger.</p>
<p>The <strong>Chroma Teal colorway has a bright blue-green finish</strong> that looks great in photos and makes your gaming setup more interesting to look at: The color stays the same all over the controller body and doesn’t mix different tones, which makes the whole thing look like it fits with the PS5’s design.&nbsp;The ergonomic shape makes it comfortable to use for long periods of time, and the textured grips on the back keep the controller from slipping during intense moments.</p>
<p>This $20 discount on a unique colorway makes the high-end features of the PS5 controller more affordable which makes it reasonable to buy a second controller for multiplayer games or as a backup. If you want the full PS5 experience, this is a great deal because you get official Sony hardware that works with haptic and adaptive triggers for less than what third-party options cost.</p>
