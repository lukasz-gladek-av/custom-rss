Just before the test period began, Blizzard released the first footage of Hazard in action and a breakdown of the Scottish hero’s kit. In some ways, Hazard feels like an amalgamation of other characters’ abilities, similar to <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/overwatch-2-juno-support-trial-period-space-ranger-1851599766&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/overwatch-2-juno-support-trial-period-space-ranger-1851599766">Juno</a></span>. However, there’s enough variation here that I can see him feeling fairly distinct, and not just like a copy of the heroes he borrows from.<br></p><p>Like most other tanks in <em>Overwatch 2</em>, Hazard’s kit is about claiming space and disrupting the enemy team. His primary fire is a medium-range, shotgun-like burst of spikes from the gatling gun on his right hand, which compliments the rest of his playstyle as a mobile, scrappy tank along the lines of Winston or Doomfist. Hazard can leap like Winston, and follow it up with a powerful melee attack using the purple spikes that grow from his armor. His mobility doesn’t end there, though, as he can also climb up walls like Hanzo and Genji. Both these abilities help him reach the high ground with ease and chase down foes that would otherwise give a more stationary tank trouble.</p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="195460" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="Overwatch 2's New Story Missions: Worth The Money?" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="122" data-playlist="195460,196880,197298" data-current="195460"><div><p>Overwatch 2's New Story Missions: Worth The Money?</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195460/195460_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195460/195460_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195460/195460_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195460/195460_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/20938.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>When Hazard actually reaches enemies in close range, he can also brawl and claim space with his Spike Guard ability that heavily reduces incoming damage, regenerates ammo, and fires spikes from his back a short distance in front of him. This is good for both pushing forward against enemies as well as retreating, but unlike Ramattra’s guarding ability, it has a time limit and can’t be used indefinitely.</p><p>Probably the most interesting tool in Hazard’s arsenal is the Jagged Wall ability. Similar to Mei with her Ice Wall, Hazard is able to build a wall that can block incoming attacks, but it’s not quite as wide as Mei’s. It makes up for this with some additional perks, including its spiky exterior that damages and repels foes who touch it, and that it can be built onto the side of walls. This gives him the opportunity to erect a wall in some spaces Mei can’t, and maybe even knock an enemy off the side of the map if you can time it right.</p><p>Rounding all this out is his ultimate, Downpour. This ability rains down purple spikes a decent distance in front of Hazard, holding enemies caught in the, er, downpour in place. Those affected can still fire their weapons, but they will be immobile for a short time, leaving them open for a killing shot.</p><p>Overall, Hazard seems like he thrives when he’s claiming space and squishy heroes will probably hate to see him coming. But I’m curious to actually see how players react to him after playing, as every time an <em>Overwatch 2 </em>hero is released, there are weeks of discourse about how they have ruined the game or aren’t good enough to move the needle. Where will Hazard fall? We’ll see in the coming days.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
