Even though it doesn’t have many proper applications, this niche movement option is a great tool to have under your belt.</p><h2 id="h84618"><a id=""></a>How to Perform Super Movement</h2><figure id="" data-id="3009c67360201d05cb63d2edee59f747" data-recommend-id="image://3009c67360201d05cb63d2edee59f747" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Hit flies upward toward Great Ape Baby, trailing next to his Super Galick Gun super attack." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Hit flies upward toward Great Ape Baby, trailing next to his Super Galick Gun super attack." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Bandai Namco / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="3009c67360201d05cb63d2edee59f747" data-recommend-id="image://3009c67360201d05cb63d2edee59f747" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Hit flies upward toward Great Ape Baby, trailing next to his Super Galick Gun super attack." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Super Movement is a technique that’s only available in the Sparking! state. That means you’ll need to charge your Ki to its maximum and beyond at the cost of a skill count. <strong>Once you’ve entered Sparking!, use a Dragon Dash (RT+A for Xbox and R2+Cross for PlayStation) and then press the Guard button (RB or R1).</strong> Your character will quickly start vanishing left and right with little recovery time. Keep on pressing the button and they’ll look like they’re flickering across the stage.</p><p>You’ll mainly want to use this to dodge supers or Ultimate Blasts. With the right timing, you can even avoid supers with the most annoyingly perfect tracking. It won’t be as useful against obscenely large attacks such as a Spirit Bomb though.</p><p>Not everyone on the roster can use Super Movement. Larger characters like Toppo and Broly, in addition to giants like Great Ape Vegeta and Janemba, simply don’t have access to the technique. The lines do get a bit blurred when it comes to different forms, as Jiren normally can’t use Super Movement, but his Full Power version can. I was lucky to figure that out while unlocking his <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/dragon-ball-sparking-zero-jiren-endings-guide-1851680142&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/dragon-ball-sparking-zero-jiren-endings-guide-1851680142">confusing endings</a></span>, but figuring it out for most other characters will just be trial and error.</p><h2 id="h84619"><a id=""></a>Don’t Mash – Use Super Movement Sparingly</h2><p>The biggest piece of advice I can give regarding this technique is to not overdo it. Yes, I completely agree that spamming it and seeing your character zip across the screen looks awesome! Unfortunately, there are some pretty big downsides to doing this:</p><ul data-type="List" data-style="Bullet"><li>Super Movement drains your Ki, typically around a quarter of a bar. With the Ki gauge already depleting in Sparking! and Super Movement costing a bar with just a few uses, it’s easy to waste your limited time in this high-powered state.</li><li>Your character won’t be moving around randomly – there is a pattern. Super Movement has you quickly swaying from side to side. This doesn’t mean the opponent will be able to easily hit you, but it is possible to dodge and then zip right back into a rush super or beam attack.</li><li>The technique will typically track toward your opponent. It’s pretty great for quickly converting from one direction back to the enemy, but sometimes it’s too quick for the camera to keep up. This is especially notable when using Super Movement with the stick pushed to the side, as the camera will struggle to stay focused on you.</li></ul><p><strong>Read More:</strong> <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/dragon-ball-sparking-zero-rush-super-landing-guide-1851673589&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/dragon-ball-sparking-zero-rush-super-landing-guide-1851673589"><em>Dragon Ball: Sparking Zero</em>’s Rush Supers Can Be A Super-Rush Once Mastered</a></span></p><p><strong>As cool as it looks, I strongly suggest performing Super Movement only once or maybe twice at a time.</strong> It only takes one well-timed use to dodge a super or ultimate blast. The only reason to spam it a little is if you’re dashing straight to your opponent and want to freak them out a bit. It can look pretty intimidating when someone is zigzagging at high speeds in your direction.</p><h2 id="h84620"><a id=""></a>Consider Some Ability Items</h2><figure id="" data-id="e918ec1386b894e4e9fe390100f3862b" data-recommend-id="image://e918ec1386b894e4e9fe390100f3862b" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The Ability Items tab in the Shop menu, with The Secret to Super Movements item highlighted." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="The Ability Items tab in the Shop menu, with The Secret to Super Movements item highlighted." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Bandai Namco / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="e918ec1386b894e4e9fe390100f3862b" data-recommend-id="image://e918ec1386b894e4e9fe390100f3862b" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The Ability Items tab in the Shop menu, with The Secret to Super Movements item highlighted." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Being careful with Super Movement isn’t the only tip we’re sharing. If you need extra leeway to work around Super Movement’s limitations, or maybe just want to flex with it more, you might want to consider making room for some choice Ability Items.</p><p>The primary issue we want to treat with these is how much the technique drains your Ki. In addition to general Ability Items that help conserve Ki, some specifically work with Super Movement. Here are the ones to look out for:</p><ul data-type="List" data-style="Bullet"><li>The Secret to Super Movements – Reduces the cost of Super Movements for the Sparking! Gauge.</li><li>The Secret to Dragon Dashes – Reduces the Ki needed for Dragon Dashes.</li><li>Style of the Strong – Sparking! Mode lasts longer.</li><li>Dragon Heart - Increases Skill Count after dodging a Blast or Ultimate Blast with a High-Speed Movement.</li></ul><p>Super Movement is certainly one of the more niche mechanics in <em>Dragon Ball: Sparking Zero</em>, with plenty writing it off as being useless. While many are rightfully sad that spamming can be detrimental, you can benefit from mastering this. It’s still obscure enough that you can scare or confuse the hell out of someone online using it. Plus, I can confidently say that nothing has felt as cool as dodging a beam super and flying alongside it to deliver a beat down. It gives big power level energy and we should all be here for it. </p><p>.<br></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

After the credits roll, we see illustrations of several key moments in the <em>Dragon Age </em>series. This includes Loghain betraying the Grey Wardens in <em>Dragon Age: Origins</em>, Bartrand stealing the lyrium idol in <em>Dragon Age II</em>, and Corypheus tearing The Breach into the sky in <em>Inquisition</em>. However, the difference is these scenes are depicted with cloaked figures called the Executors. The implication is that the Executors have been pulling the strings of the <em>Dragon Age </em>universe all along, and some fans have taken this to mean that this faction has been controlling the villains of each game to do their bidding.</p><p>Epler took to <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://bsky.app/profile/eplerjc.bsky.social/post/3laxp3bf6mk2o&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://bsky.app/profile/eplerjc.bsky.social/post/3laxp3bf6mk2o" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Bluesky</a></span> to clear this misconception up using the <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://rot13.com/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://rot13.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">ROT13 cipher</a></span> to hide spoilers from those who haven’t beaten the game yet. But his translated message explains that while the Executors have perhaps nudged history over the decades, Loghain, Bartrand, and Corypheus were all acting of their own free will.</p><blockquote data-type="BlockQuote"><p>“[T]he word choice of balanced, whispered, guided is VERY DELIBERATE,” Epler’s deciphered message reads. “No one was forced or coerced or controlled into making any choices.</p><p>It’s extremely important that ultimately everyone made their own choices. they still own the consequences of these decisions, because <em>Dragon Age</em> is still a series about people making decisions of their own free will and those decisions having consequences”</p></blockquote><p>It’s unclear just how the Executors “guided” past <em>Dragon Age </em>villains, nor do we have a concrete sense of what they hoped to gain by pushing history in those directions. Right now, the running theory is they may be involved with the Forgotten Ones, elven gods who were long removed from the contemporary pantheon elves worshipped before the events of <em>The Veilguard</em>. Whatever the truth is, <em>The Veilguard</em>’s post-credits scene heavily implies they will play a major role in the next <em>Dragon Age </em>game, but that’s probably several years away as BioWare shifts focus to the <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/mass-effect-teaser-n7-day-andromeda-1850999958&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/mass-effect-teaser-n7-day-andromeda-1850999958">upcoming fifth <em>Mass Effect</em></a></span>.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
