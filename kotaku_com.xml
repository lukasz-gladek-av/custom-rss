The fan says they have, but it was a while ago. To that, Ryan responds: “Well, you might have to beat it again...” Ryan then nods, knowingly, and smiles. </p><p>“Is this true? I gotta run through all of them again,” says the fan. </p><p>“Well, especially this one,” says Ryan in response. “There’s a reason I say that, but I can’t say anything.”</p><p>So yeah, it seems like Ryan is teasing <em>something </em>about <em>Black Flag</em>. Now, it could be a comic, maybe a new novel, or perhaps some special update that’s coming to <em>Assassin’s Creed: Shadows</em> that will contain some <em>Black Flag</em>-themed content. But it seems odd that the voice actor for Edward Kenway would have insider knowledge about that stuff or would tease it like this. More likely, this is Ryan teasing the rumored and reported still-in-development <em>Black Flag</em> remake or remaster project. </p><p><em>Kotaku </em>has contacted Ubisoft for comment. </p><p>As previously mentioned, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/assassin-s-creed-4-black-flag-remake-skull-bones-1850596271&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/assassin-s-creed-4-black-flag-remake-skull-bones-1850596271">in 2023 <em>Kotaku </em>reported</a></span> that it had learned from multiple sources that a remake of the 2013 <em>Assassin’s Creed </em>game was in early stages and would not be completed for a few years. It’s said to be more than a straight port of the old game to new consoles.<span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/the-messy-stalled-reckoning-at-an-assassins-creed-co-d-1847336158&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/the-messy-stalled-reckoning-at-an-assassins-creed-co-d-1847336158"> A team at Ubisoft Singapore</a></span>, one of the studios that has led development on the<em> Assassin’s Creed</em> franchise’s evolving ocean tech, is said to be heavily involved in helping to modernize<em> Black Flag. </em></p><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://mp1st.com/news/assassins-creed-black-flag-remake-more-than-visual-upgrade-new-systems-mentioned&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://mp1st.com/news/assassins-creed-black-flag-remake-more-than-visual-upgrade-new-systems-mentioned" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Another report from <em>MP1st </em>in January</a></span> further claimed that the remake was not just a simple port and would include new systems and content. That would likely mean Matt Ryan would need to be brought back in for some voice recording. And considering that voice acting generally doesn’t happen until later in a game’s development, this <em>Black Flag</em> remake may be launching sooner than later. In fact, Ubisoft doesn’t have any big games coming out this holiday season.

The shooter just entered its 17th season, bringing with it a retro-game-themed battle pass, new heroes and maps for Stadium, and map voting across all modes. All of that sounds good on paper, but the addition of map voting and the way Blizzard implemented the system has split the community. After playing around with it myself, I yearn for the days of getting randomly assigned a map before a match.</p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="196880" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="Ranking Overwatch 2 Season 10's Biggest Changes" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="218" data-playlist="196880,195460,196049" data-current="196880"><div><p>Ranking Overwatch 2 Season 10's Biggest Changes</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196880/196880_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196880/196880_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196880/196880_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196880/196880_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/22434.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>The way map voting works in <em>Overwatch 2 </em>is that players are presented with three maps before a match begins. Everyone votes for their preferred stage, and then those votes are put into a roulette that picks between them at random. The idea is that the more people who vote for a map, the higher the chance it has of getting picked. This also means that less popular maps aren’t off the table entirely, and that is the first point of contention folks are voicing about the system, as several clips are being published online of a map that gets one vote being selected over a majority decision from the rest of the players in the game.</p><p>A cursory glance <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://us.forums.blizzard.com/en/overwatch/t/map-voting-just-made-me-ragequit/971593&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://us.forums.blizzard.com/en/overwatch/t/map-voting-just-made-me-ragequit/971593" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">at the Blizzard forums</a></span> will show you people arguing the merits of the system, with some asserting that a system that gives every player a chance to play on a map they want means that you won’t have to play the same maps over and over, even if they still feel like they’re playing on less-popular maps at an alarming frequency. Some are even speculating that the map voting system might be weighing maps with fewer votes differently, but that’s just conjecture. Others would rather Blizzard scrap the roulette system entirely in favor of a majority rule, which would probably fix some folks’ issues with being forced to play on maps they don’t like, but would also likely result in most <em>Overwatch 2 </em>matches taking place on the same handful of popular maps.</p><p>Anecdotally, my frustration with the system is that it makes it difficult (if not impossible) to get time in with newer maps. Season 17 added a new Flashpoint map called Aatlis that I haven’t been able to play a match on even once. In my experience, people vote for the maps they know, and that means that statistically, fewer players are voting for something new they aren’t used to playing on. Every time Aatlis has shown up on map voting, it’s been pretty handily outvoted, so I haven’t even seen the map for myself yet. Before map voting was added, matches would be randomly assigned a map with no input from players, so you would eventually get to see new maps as they came through standard play. Now, I guess I have to jump into a custom match to even run around in it?</p><p>One fix would be for voting to be removed from quick-play modes. I see the argument for having such a system in ranked because people in that mode get sweaty and want to craft what they view to be an optimal game. For those of us who just want to jump into an easy, uncomplicated match, however, map voting adds a new potential frustration without enough benefit to make it worth it. I wanted to get in a match or two on the Pride March Midtown map before it went back into the vault at the end of Pride Month, but now I can’t even stumble upon it without having to cross my fingers that someone else votes for it to improve the odds. The system isn’t even a week old, so there might just be some growing pains for fans and Blizzard to sort through. Hopefully, the team makes some quick improvements to map voting as season 17 goes on.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://kotaku.com/overwatch-2-new-map-voting-season-17-patch-push-escort-1851785326]]></content:encoded>

The tale of a smart, innovative man stranded on Mars went on to have a great movie based on it, directed by legendary filmmaker Ridley Scott. It was a glorious success story...and then Weir published <em>Artemis</em>. Oh good lord, what a fall. An astoundingly terrible book, it is one of the most excruciating examples of the “<span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://www.jezebel.com/strong-female-characters-arent-enough-goddammit-1592135553&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.jezebel.com/strong-female-characters-arent-enough-goddammit-1592135553">strong female character</a></span>” trope, and while rights to make a movie were purchased before it was published, it’s not really a surprise that nothing’s happened with that since 2018.</p><p>Fears that the author, who self-published <em>The Martian</em> after being rejected by various imprints, might be a one-hit-wonder grew, until 2021's <em>Project Hail Mary</em> appeared, and was a completely compelling piece of sci-fi on par with his first book. Phew! And now, we have a first trailer for the inevitable movie adaptation, starring Ryan Gosling as the book’s main character, Ryland Grace. Even better, the screenplay is by Drew Goddard, who not only wrote <em>The Cabin in the Woods</em>, <em>Cloverfield</em>, and many episodes of <em>Buffy</em>, <em>Angel</em> and <em>Lost</em>, but also adapted <em>The Martian</em>. Oh, and it’s being directed by Phil Lord and Christopher Miller, the pair behind <em>The Lego Movie</em> and the writers of the<em> Into The Spider-Verse </em>movies.</p><p>So Ryland Grace is a junior high science teacher with a specialist background in molecular biology who is rather forcibly drafted to help with an effort by the European Space Agency to investigate a universal phenomenon of “dimming,” whereby stars are losing luminescence, including, rather pressingly, our own. Grace is pressured into joining a years-long mission to a star, Tau Ceti, that is resistant to the dimming, to find out why. Except, as you’d expect, lots goes wrong. But this isn’t a movie about that!</p><p>If you’ve not read the book, the latter third of the trailer might feel like quite a spoiler, and—I dunno—if I were marketing this, I’d have been a bit more subtle. But in truth, it’s actually setting up the vast bulk of the story, and really gives nothing away about the true extent of the narrative.</p><p>This is, without giving any specifics, a story about a unique relationship, and if the film can match the intimacy and uniquely peculiar nature of the novel, it could be very special. Or, the movie could trivialize that aspect and be far more about shit exploding in space. Who knows. But still, it looks pretty and fun so far.</p><p>The movie, which also stars Sandra Hüller, Liz Kingsman, and Lionel Boyce, is headed to theaters in March of next year. I imagine we’ll be seeing a lot more of it before then.</p><p>.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://kotaku.com/project-hail-mary-trailer-ryan-gosling-andy-weir-1851785317]]></content:encoded>

Originally in Waco, Texas, before it outgrew the available venues, the annual event now takes place in Houston, where it “unites enthusiasts globally to celebrate gaming, anime, sports, film, music &amp; pop culture while fostering inclusivity and a sense of belonging.” And, of course, features some amazing cosplay.</p><p>Dream Con also draws big-name stars, with 2025's gathering hosting no less than Megan Thee Stallion, alongside the amazing Cedric Yarbrough (<em>Reno 911!</em>, <em>The 40-Year-Old Virgin</em>), writer Rodney Barnes (<em>The Boondocks</em>, <em>Winning Time</em>) and the enormously popular YouTuber Caleb City.</p><p>But also, cosplayers! There’s a fantastic, eclectic mix of characters portrayed, including even Megan Thee Stallion herself as Yoruichi from<em> Bleach</em>. Joining her are fits from <em>Sinners</em>, <em>One Piece</em>, and some of the most inventive X-Men you’ve ever seen.
