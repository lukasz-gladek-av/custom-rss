The thing is bonkers and seems way too big to actually be used as a popcorn bucket in a crowded movie theater. The Galactus bucket is 17 inches tall and covered in a faux-metal outer skin. It looks pretty good and even includes LED lights in the eyes. But something this big and fancy doesn’t come cheap. And if you want one of these big heads, you’ll have to spend the same amount of money on it as you would on a copy of <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/mario-kart-world-switch-2-clips-stunts-rewind-wall-1851783907&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/mario-kart-world-switch-2-clips-stunts-rewind-wall-1851783907"><em>Mario Kart World</em></a></span><em>. </em></p><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://amctheatresshop.com/products/the-fantastic-four-first-steps-galactus-361oz-popcorn-container-with-led?srsltid=AfmBOopOPUD0er0nUQmfzxrErX66yJDCsPzQcOJ0xjb3J22EAWpZGQdh&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://amctheatresshop.com/products/the-fantastic-four-first-steps-galactus-361oz-popcorn-container-with-led?srsltid=AfmBOopOPUD0er0nUQmfzxrErX66yJDCsPzQcOJ0xjb3J22EAWpZGQdh" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The new AMC Galactus bucket is listed on the website for an eye-watering $79.95</a></span>, and that’s before tax! This high price was officially revealed a few days ago, but has started making the rounds <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://bsky.app/profile/culturecrave.co/post/3lrb4acbjb226&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://bsky.app/profile/culturecrave.co/post/3lrb4acbjb226" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">via social media and Reddit</a></span> as people react to the idea of spending $80+ on a bucket of popcorn. But hey, AMC does confirm that the container includes a free large order of popcorn. Honestly, it should come with a free drink, too. </p><p>“Motherfucker, I work at a theatre and we can BARELY sell the $20-$30 novelty buckets until we start discounting them because they don’t sell for shit,” said one user on Bluesky. I’ve heard similar stories while talking to other AMC employees about these gimmick buckets for a future report. </p><p>Many tell me that they will sit around for ages, and sometimes are sold for a few dollars a few weeks after the movie hits theaters. Although at the same time, I’m also told that there are people out there who collect these buckets and will call ahead to procure one and not even watch the movie it’s based on. So, as always, when you incredulously ask, “Is anyone going to buy this?” the answer is still yes. </p><p> .<br></p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Players are fighting for their lives just to survive early kangaroo and elephant mobs. </p><p>Two things seem to be going on. 1) the base game of <em>Overture</em> is very hard. 2) enemy scaling for New Game Plus has ramped up significantly. As a result, players who should in theory be the most experienced at the game are finding the DLC the most difficult. “It’s beyond overtuned,” wrote one fan. “Like I’m all for difficulty but my lord is it wild how much more difficult it is from the main game.” Another added, “They messed up DLC NG+ scaling there is no doubt. I think there will be patches that fix this, but for now...We suffer or reduces the difficulty lol.”</p><p>Some players have been doing exactly that, taking advantage of Neowiz’s controversial decision to add difficulty options to its Soulsborne, to make progress after hours of hitting their heads against brick walls. The South Korean studio has been taking notice, and released a <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7BY3Zw_nOCI&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7BY3Zw_nOCI" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>Lies of P</em> Director’s Letter on YouTube</a></span> on Tuesday to share cryptic details about upcoming changes to the DLC. </p><p> “We identified areas that did not turn out quite as we intended,” Ji Won Choi told fans. “Therefore, we are reviewing various adjustments, including difficulty reduction. However, combat is one of the most fundamental experiences in <em>Lies of P</em>, so any modifications or changes require meticulous work and thorough testing. We are still reviewing the specific details and schedule for a patch, but we wanted to let you know as soon as possible why it’s taking our team some time, and the general direction we’re heading.”</p><p>The citizens of Krat can breathe a small sigh of relief than knowing that their slog through Overture might become a little more forgiving in the weeks ahead, though a set release date for the upcoming patch, as well as what Neowiz actually plans to change, remains pending. In the meantime, we can liberate ourselves from our Soulsborne shame and make use of the newly-introduced easier modes. </p><p>“The release of additional easier difficulties alongside the DLC almost seems like a justification for how much of a difficulty wall there is between the base game and the DLC—enemies hit stupidly hard, and have stupidly high HP,” wrote one player on Steam. “If you’re into that, great, but I found the DLC far more enjoyable when I went down a difficulty, and it felt like a far more natural progression on the base game.”</p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
