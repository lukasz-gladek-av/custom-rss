              <p>Game file sizes just keep growing bigger and bigger, but consoles struggle to keep up. Just look at the Xbox Series X|S. The more robust Series X has an internal SSD with storage totaling 1TB. With the Series S, you get about half that at 512GB. Not all of that is usable storage though as much of it is holding the system software needed for your Xbox to work in the first place. Then we have games come out like last year’s&nbsp;<em>Call of Duty Black Ops 6</em> with a file size in the triple digits. If you play more than three or four games, you’re going to be in a constant struggle of deleting and redownloading software as you bounce between games.</p>
<p>Luckily, their are external options. <strong>The Seagate Game Drive for Xbox comes with a crazy 5TB of storage</strong> to put all of your file size worries to bed.<a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3958/"> It normally goes for $150, but right now it’s 13% off which brings the price down to just $130.</a> You’ll save a good $20 (which just so happens to be exactly enough to hop into&nbsp;<em>Hollow Knight: Silksong</em>).</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3958/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>More Gaming Ahead</h2>
<p>Ok so here’s the catch. This is an HDD, not an SSD. Hard disk drives are notably slower than solid state drives. So much so that the Seagate game drive is incapable of playing Xbox Series X|S games directly from it. You’ll have to move the game file from the HDD to your Xbox’s internal storage in order to play it—sort of the digital version of taking your game disc off the shelf and popping it into the console.</p>
<p>Transferring the files can be much faster than redownloading from Microsoft’s servers otherwise would be, especially if you live in an area with unreliable bandwidth.</p>



<p>The good news is that if you’re still playing a bunch of Xbox One, Xbox 360, or original Xbox titles, they can be loaded and played directly from the drive. The drive is also compatible with Xbox One and Xbox 360 directly if tho9se consoles still get regular action in your place.</p>
<p>The HDD is portable as well. You can have your games loaded onto it, then take it over to a friend’s house. Pop it into their Xbox and you’ll be able to load up or move over your games onto their console. The drive is simple plug and play making it pretty straight forward to use.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3958/">Right now, you can save $20 on the Seagate Game Drive for Xbox for a limited time. Get it for just $130.</a></p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/elon-musk-favorite-game-deus-ex-conspiracy-2000624003</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/deus-ex-writer-says-the-fact-elon-musk-loves-it-is-its-%E2%80%98worst-legacy%E2%80%99.1291470/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Great fiction can’t fix bad people. That’s one takeaway from the fact that <a href="https://kotaku.com/elon-musk-grimes-cyberpunk-elden-ring-twitter-1850858252">Elon Musk seems to love</a> the classic sci-fi immersive sim <em>Deus Ex</em> despite it being a game precisely about how people like him are ruining the world. One of the game’s writers recently explained how that’s the worst part of its legacy.</p> <p>Released in 2000, <a href="https://kotaku.com/deus-ex-25-years-ion-storm-looking-glass-warren-ellis-1851784985"><em>Deus Ex</em> follows</a><a href="https://kotaku.com/deus-ex-25-years-ion-storm-looking-glass-warren-ellis-1851784985"> anti-terrorism operative JC Denton,</a> who uses his cybernetic enhancements to uncover the conspiratorial forces trying to take control of a world ravaged by social upheaval, economic collapse, and a plague. It’s both an investigation of how propaganda shapes society and what it means to be human, in addition to being a really clever stealth action game about hacking people’s private email.</p> <p>“That kind of political weight and social satire is a real common thread between <em>Deus Ex</em> and <em>Dishonored</em>,” Austin Grossman, who co-wrote the Warren Spector-directed hit with Sheldon Pacotti and Chris Todd, <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/fps/deus-exs-influence-on-elon-musk-may-be-its-longest-worst-legacy-says-its-writer/">recently told <em>PC Gamer</em></a>. “It is the thing that Elon Musk likes, creepily. It is creepily in Elon Musk’s worldview. So that may be its longest, worst legacy.”</p>

 <p>Musk has repeatedly called <em>Deus Ex</em> one of his <a href="https://x.com/elonmusk/status/1321245225755512832">favorite games ever</a>. When the pandemic began in early 2020, he even described it as feeling <a href="https://x.com/elonmusk/status/1241104391706304512?">like something from the game’s plot</a>. Musk also happens to be one of the world’s richest people, on track to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/09/05/business/elon-musk-tesla-pay-trillionaire.html">become the first trillionaire</a>, whose tech empire includes companies trying to implant devices <a href="https://www.npr.org/2024/01/30/1227850900/elon-musk-neuralink-implant-clinical-trial">directly into people’s brains</a>. Reading the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/deus-ex-at-20-the-oral-history-of-a-pivotal-pc-game">oral history of <em>Deus Ex</em>‘s creation</a>, there’s little doubt the <a href="https://kotaku.com/elon-musk-poe2-diablo-4-paid-boosting-fake-controversy-1851743670"><em>Diablo</em> cheater</a> would have been considered <a href="https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/are-we-the-baddies">one of the baddies</a> in its world.</p> <p>“It’s bizarre that Elon Musk would not recognize where he actually sits in the<em> Deus Ex</em> universe, because it is not in the JC Denton role,” Grossman said. “Musk plainly imagines he’s the JC Denton of this world—a plainspoken everyman, standing up to the elite. As is obvious to everyone, Musk is the one with power and he’s just pathologically incapable of honest introspection.”</p> <p>He continued, “I would say Musk is like a<em> Deus Ex</em> villain, except that the franchise doesn’t have any villains as whiny and self-servingly delusional as he’s shown himself to be.”</p>

              <p>How old is the TV in your living room? Is it absent of any smart features and streaming apps? Or maybe it is a smart TV, but you’re just not a fan of that particular manufacturer’s user interface (I’m looking at you LG with your wannabe Wiimote motion controls). You don’t need to be locked down to whatever your TV was capable of just out of the box. Pick up a Roku streaming stick for basically nothing and now you’ve got an intuitive, reliable way to stream content and navigate the apps. Usually, you can find<strong> the 2025 Roku Streaming Stick Plus with 4K and HDR support</strong> for $40. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3957/">However, right now Amazon is running a limited time deal that’s bringing its price down by 27% to just $29.</a></p>

<h2>Jump Right In</h2>

Customize the home screen to your preferences, putting the apps you use most frequently front and center. You’ll even be able to watch a good handful of Roku originals at absolutely no added cost. The service has shows like <em>Dinner Budget Showdown</em>,&nbsp;<em>Celebrity Family Food Battle</em>,&nbsp;<em>Martha Cooks</em>,&nbsp;<em>Emeril Cooks</em><em>,&nbsp;</em>and I’m sure a bunch of other stuff that aren’t cooking shows.</p>



<p>This streaming stick from Roku is capable of streaming content in 4K resolution and in HDR, so you won’t be sacrificing any image quality by making the jump from your 4K HDR TV’s interface to the more user-friendly Roku Plus. The streaming stick can even by synced up with your TV so it automatically turns on and off with one press. You can even control volume and navigate your Roku all with just the one remote. It even has a voice buttons which makes searching for your favorite TV shows or movies even easier. Just hold the button, say, “<em>My Cousin Vinny</em>,” and the next thing you know, you’ll be watching Marisa Tomei bang her foot on the ground as her biological clock ticks <em>like this</em>.</p>
<p>The Roku Streaming Stick Plus is designed to be unobtrusive. It’s compact form factor doesn’t block any other neighboring HDMI inputs. It’s powered by USB-A so you can just plug that end of it right back into your TV to run it. The whole thing will stay out of sight and you’ll avoid and extra cable running out, adding to the clutter.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3957/">Right now, you can grab the Roku Streaming Stick Plus for nearly 30% off for a limited time.</a></p>

              <p>Nintendo’s war against modders and ROM distributors has seen some brutal takedowns over the years, <a href="https://kotaku.com/bowser-agrees-to-pay-nintendo-10-million-in-hacking-la-1848172917">dishing out extraordinary punishments</a> against those who make it possible for people to pirate Nintendo games. The latest to fall afoul of the Japanese behemoth is Ryan Daly, who for the longest time looked like he was attempting an incredibly optimistic and clearly naive attempt to fight back. That’s over now as the MIG switch modder has settled for $2 million and an agreement to never touch a mod again in his life.</p> <p>Ryan “Homebrew Homie” Daly had run Modded Hardware, a site that sold modded Switches able to install homebrew or pirated versions of Switch games, and sold the tools with which others could do the same. Nintendo also claimed the site would return Switches with pirated games pre-installed. Back in March 2024, Nintendo threatened to sue Daly over the site, and the two parties agreed that Daly would stop his naughty behavior and the whole thing would go away. Daly said he would, then absolutely didn’t. So in June, Nintendo went to court.</p> <p>Daly continued to make surprising choices. Rather than rush to settle, the entrepreneur instead opted to respond to the complaint denying all wrongdoing, and even more wildly, did this without the advice of any lawyers. He even denied being responsible for the Modded Hardware business.</p>

 <figure id="attachment_2000623987" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000623987"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000623987">© Modded Hardware / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p><a href="https://torrentfreak.com/modded-hardware-defendant-denies-nintendos-copyright-claims-in-court-241006/">As reported by&nbsp;<em>TorrentFreak</em></a>, Daly’s <a href="https://torrentfreak.com/images/daly-response.pdf">response</a> wasn’t exactly stunning legal work. He essentially quoted the accusations and wrote “ANSWER: Denied” underneath them. However, despite all the denials of having done the things, Daly added “affirmative defenses” of the very things he was saying he didn’t do, defenses which included fair use and even accusing Nintendo of a “lack of unclean hands,” a legal doctrine that suggests Nintendo had acted unethically or dishonestly.</p> <p>Well, surprisingly enough this didn’t work out so well. This weekend the Seattle District Court <a href="https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.wawd.336725/gov.uscourts.wawd.336725.30.0.pdf">released the details of a settlement</a>, in which Daly agrees to pay Nintendo $2 million, as well as hand over the URL of his site, and even agrees to the seizure of all his technology that might contain the means to infringe the agreement. It also comes with the most astonishingly strict list of requirements based on what Daly is and isn’t allowed to do for the rest of his life, which goes on for pages and pretty much amounts to never touching another MIG switch or modding tool so long as he lives.</p> <p>Whether Daly can afford to pay the $2 million is largely irrelevant to Nintendo. The company <a href="https://kotaku.com/nintendo-gary-bowser-hacking-case-legal-jail-xecuter-1850346297">gleefully bankrupted Gary Bowser</a> over his association with a ROM-selling site in 2021, with a $10 million ruling the man will never be able to pay off, along with a gruesome 40-month prison sentence.</p>

              <p>It’s always frustrating when your phone dies in the middle of the day when you need it. From trying to order a ride to checking emails or just browsing something to pass the time, running low on battery can spoil it all. If you’d rather never have to go through that again, the solution is simple: grab a decent power bank.</p>
<p>But hold up — not all of these are worth your money. Some charge like they’re trying to break records, some suck their batteries dry too fast, and most are just too bulky to lug around. That’s where Anker enters the scene with a 10,000mAh model that’s our absolute favorite: And <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3966/">now that Amazon sells it for just $19, reduced from its original price of $26, there’s never been a better time to grab one and add it to your day kit</a>.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3966/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Our Fav Power Bank</h2>
<p><strong>Anker PowerCore 10K has a 10,000mAh capacity</strong> which is more than enough to charge <strong>most smartphones two or three times from one recharge</strong>. That’s to say you can go out all day without needing to worry about keeping your phone charged. It also works with tablets such as an iPad, so it’s not just on your phone. As <strong>airplane-friendly as well</strong>, you can even leave it in your carry-on bag without worrying about restrictions.</p>
<p>With Anker’s PowerIQ and VoltageBoost technology, <strong>it charges up to 5V/3A</strong>&nbsp;so you’re not waiting around for hours just to have your phone return to a decent battery level. That means charging for the briefest moment can provide you with a genuine boost, something that’s handy if you’re in transit with not much stopping time to refuel. And with<strong> both USB-C in and out and a traditional USB-A port</strong>, it supports both newer and older cables and gives you flexibility regardless of the daily device you’re working with.</p>



<p>With a size about the width of a smartphone, it easily fits into a pocket, small purse or backpack without adding bulk. You won’t wince lugging it around like with some of those other larger battery packs that are brick-like. It still packs enough juice in it to keep you powered up without sacrificing size, which is the reason so many swear by it for daily use and travel.</p>
<p><span>This deal feels like one of those no-brainers that should be grabbed before it disappears: You’re essentially getting travel-ready security for your phone or tablet at a price lower than most cases, and it’s backed by one of the most trusted names in charging.</span></p>
