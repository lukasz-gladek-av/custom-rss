              <p>The news that <a href="https://kotaku.com/netflix-warner-bros-deal-batman-hbo-max-2000650875">Netflix is trying to buy Warner Bros.</a> didn’t ever look like it would be <a href="https://kotaku.com/netflix-wb-batman-arkham-hogwarts-legacy-mortal-kombat-2000650918">good for game players</a>, but a recent investor call by the streamer suggests things are a whole lot worse than we previously imagined. Netflix co-CEO Gregory Peters told investors that when it came to Warner’s gaming division, it didn’t even factor it into the $83 billion dollar deal. It was apparently considered to add nothing to the company’s overall value, because “they’re relatively minor compared to the grand scheme of things.”</p> <p>Warner Bros. Games hasn’t exactly shone of late, with <a href="https://kotaku.com/monolith-productions-wonder-woman-multiversus-cancel-wb-1851766400">multiple closures</a> of <a href="https://kotaku.com/black-panther-ea-cliffhanger-monolith-productions-1851782787">extremely talented teams</a>, and the <a href="https://kotaku.com/multiversus-season-5-aquaman-offline-update-refund-1851752453">recent flops of <em>MultiVersus</em></a> and <em><a href="https://kotaku.com/suicide-squad-hogwarts-legacy-rocksteady-arkham-1851522893">Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League</a></em>, but it’s still hardly minor. For one, <em>Hogwarts Legacy&nbsp;</em>was the best-selling game of 2023 in the U.S., more popular that <em>Call of Duty</em>, selling 34 million copies in its first year. That’s&nbsp;<em>billions</em> of dollars in revenue.&nbsp;Then you’ve got the <em>Arkham</em> franchise, <em>Mortal Kombat</em>, plus the infinite money machine that is every single&nbsp;<em>Lego</em> game from&nbsp;<em>Star Wars</em> to&nbsp;<em>Harry Potter</em> to&nbsp;<em>Batman</em>. Yes, it’s suffered as much as every other arm of the company under David Zaslav, but it’s not something you’d immediately write off as worthless. However, that’s the price Netflix put on Warner Bros. Games when bidding for the whole company.</p>

 <p>“While they definitely have been doing some great work in the game space,” said Gregory Peters on the <a href="https://seekingalpha.com/article/4851311-netflix-inc-nflx-presents-at-ubs-global-media-and-communications-conference-2025-transcript">December 8 call</a> (thanks&nbsp;<a href="https://www.pocketgamer.biz/netflix-didnt-attribute-any-value-to-warner-bros-games-business-in-83bn-mega-deal/"><em>Pocket Gamer</em></a>), “we actually didn’t attribute any value to that from the get-go because they’re relatively minor compared to the grand scheme of things.”</p>

 <h2>Netflix already failed hard with games</h2> <p>It’s important to put this perspective into context. Netflix has spent <a href="https://kotaku.com/netflix-squid-game-unleashed-app-subscription-team-blue-1851755122"><em>years</em> trying to work out how to make money through video games</a>, and only <a href="https://kotaku.com/netflix-gaming-hades-monument-vally-golden-idol-braid-1851785038">failed</a> and <a href="https://kotaku.com/netflix-team-blue-bungie-blizzard-sony-closed-1851678075">failed again</a>, stripping back expensive forays into the worlds of PC and console gaming and now sticking exclusively to mobile games with a casual emphasis. That makes sense: Netflix is a TV and movie streaming service, and it was <a href="https://kotaku.com/netflix-google-stadia-cloud-streaming-xbox-ps5-geforce-1849676394">with hubris that it launched its video gaming ambitions</a> into a market that Google had just so spectacularly crashed out of. Big companies look at the sorts of numbers publishers make from a <em>Call of Duty</em> or&nbsp;<em>Genshin Impact</em> and think, “We’d like some of that please,” and assume it just happens. It doesn’t, millions gets wasted, and people lose jobs.</p>

 <p>It’s in the aftermath of this that Netflix is attempting its purchase of Warner Bros., so on some level you can understand why a company so disillusioned with gaming might be so <i lang="fr">laissez faire</i> with this aspect of the prize. However, it also speaks of some quite spectacular shortsightedness, given the lucrative nature of so many of WBG’s licenses.</p>

 <p>This all suggests bad times are ahead for those surviving developers under Warner’s roof. Peters further comments initially suggest there might be some internal insight, as he says, “Now we’re super excited because some of those properties that they’ve built<!--StartFragment --><span>—</span><!--EndFragment --><em>Hogwarts</em> is a great example of that<!--StartFragment --><span>—</span><!--EndFragment -->have done quite well, and we think that we can incorporate that into what we’re offering.” However, “what we’re offering” is the key phrase, given how clear Netflix has recently made its focus on mobile only. “They’ve got great studios and great folks working there,” adds Peters, “so we think that there’s definitely an opportunity there. But just to be clear, we haven’t built that into our deal model.”</p> <p>It certainly makes sense to see the IPs Netflix is getting in the deal as opportunities when it comes to its casual gaming development. The&nbsp;<em>Lego</em> games are already mobile-friendly and have a broad family audience, while licenses like <em>Harry Potter</em> and <em>Batman</em> can be milked in an endless stream of mediocre cellphone games. But hopes for further entries in Rocksteady’s <em>Arkham</em> franchise seem unlikely to be met, let alone the new owners reviving what Warner Bros. once did best, with game series like <em>Shadow of Mordor</em>, <em>FEAR</em>, and other cruelly abandoned Monolith properties.</p>

              <p>Good morning. Unfortunately, I swear it’s not my fault but yes, today is Tuesday, aka <a href="https://kotaku.com/days-of-the-week-ranked-from-best-to-worst-2000639864">the worst day of the week</a>. But hey, at least we are here together to enjoy another installment of <em>Kotaku’s</em> Morning Checkpoint, a daily round-up of video game news and other stuff you might care about. Today, we have data on how well <em>Elden Ring</em>‘s DLC is selling, a weird <em>Stranger Things</em> crossover, and a report of a new 2K studio with connections to that canceled<em> Perfect Dark</em> game.</p> <h2><strong>Bosses Behind Canned<em> Perfect Dark</em> Reboot Reportedly Creating New 2K Studio</strong></h2> <p>First announced in 2020 and then officially revealed in <a href="https://kotaku.com/perfect-dark-xbox-showcase-gameplay-1851528864">2024 with a snazzy gameplay trailer</a>, Xbox’s <em>Perfect Dark</em> reboot had a lot of buzz around it before <a href="https://kotaku.com/xbox-reportedly-cancels-that-cool-looking-perfect-dark-1851785531">it was canned by Microsoft in July</a>. The studio behind the game, The Initiative, was also shut down. And now, <a href="https://kotaku.com/perfect-dark-canceled-take-two-embracer-xbox-crystal-dynamics-2000622400">following a reported attempt at Take-Two to save</a> <em>Perfect Dark,</em> the publisher behind <em>GTA</em> and<em> NBA 2K</em> has apparently hired two of the bosses behind the canceled reboot and is funding the creation of a new game studio.</p>

 <p><a href="https://bsky.app/profile/did:plc:2mkgbhbhqvappkkorf2bzyrp/post/3m7izaecnvc2j">As first reported by <em>Bloomberg’s</em> Jason Schreier</a> on Tuesday, former <em>Perfect Dark</em> director Brian Horton and former The Initiative studio head Darrell Gallagher are building a brand new studio within 2K Games. <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7403902973464014848/">Gallagher later confirmed the news on LinkedIn</a>. We have no other details about the studio, but it is interesting to see this saga unfold. I guess some people at Take-Two were really impressed by that<em> Perfect Dark</em> demo, huh?</p> <div><blockquote data-bluesky-uri="at://did:plc:2mkgbhbhqvappkkorf2bzyrp/app.bsky.feed.post/3m7izaecnvc2j" data-bluesky-cid="bafyreiedakzbq5fnpipnr65rwghg5p7c3gpqxejosc73vaimwdnixdbuwi"> <p lang="en">Earlier this year I broke the news that Take-Two was close to rescuing Xbox’s Perfect Dark but the deal fell apart.</p> <p>Now, a new development: Take-Two has hired Perfect Dark studio head Darrell Gallagher and director Brian Horton to start a brand new studio within 2K.</p> <p>— <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/did:plc:2mkgbhbhqvappkkorf2bzyrp?ref_src=embed">Jason Schreier (@jasonschreier.bsky.social)</a> <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/did:plc:2mkgbhbhqvappkkorf2bzyrp/post/3m7izaecnvc2j?ref_src=embed">2025-12-08T21:51:37.009Z</a></p></blockquote></div>  <h2><strong>Why <em>Resident Evil 2</em> Featured No Returning Characters</strong></h2> <p><em>Resident Evil 2</em> game director, <em>Bayonetta</em> creator, and famed online poster Hideki Kamiya has recently been talking more about Capcom’s beloved 1998 survival horror game on social media. And on December 9, <a href="https://x.com/HidekiKamiya_X/status/1998278386020671793?">Kamiya explained to a fan</a> why he didn’t include any characters from <em>Resident Evil</em> in the sequel, saying:</p>

 <p>“At the time, I was a selfish idiot who didn’t consider the feelings of the users, so when I was making <em>Biohazard 2</em>, I decided to remove all the characters from the previous game and start a new one. In the end, this was buried in the dark as <em>Biohazard 1.5</em>, and when Sugimura-sensei joined the team later, he got mad at me, saying, ‘Why aren’t you including the characters from the previous game?’, so I added Chris’s sister, Claire…”</p>

 <h2><strong><em>Elden Ring: Nightreign’</em>s First DLC Has Already Sold Over 2 Million Copies</strong></h2> <p>In less than two weeks, <em>Elden Ring: Nightreign’s&nbsp;</em>first DLC, Forsaken Hollows, has already sold two million copies. <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2622380/view/493836377652201354?l=english">The news comes via FromSoftware</a>, who posted a thank you to all the fans who have “joined the hunt against the Dreglord.”</p> <h2><strong>And now for one of 2025’s weirdest crossovers</strong></h2> <p>When I think of <em>Microsoft Flight Simulator, I</em> think of realistic planes, gorgeous landscapes, and of course, a hit TV show set in the 80s featuring demons and sci-fi monsters. Wait, sorry, I wrote that sentence after falling down the stairs and landing on my head really hard. Anyway, yeah, <a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2025/12/09/netflix-stranger-things-coming-to-microsoft-flight-simulator-2024/"><em>Stranger Things</em> is coming to <em>Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024.</em> Yay?</a></p> <h2>ICYMI:</h2> <ul> <li><a href="https://kotaku.com/horses-review-steam-epic-games-ban-horror-ride-race-2000651442">Here’s our review of the controversial <em>Horses</em></a></li> <li><a href="https://kotaku.com/gamestop-trade-in-anything-day-pokemon-coupon-2000651415">The chaos of Gamestop’s “Trade In Anything” day</a></li> <li><a href="https://kotaku.com/the-streamer-awards-2025-streamer-of-the-year-2000651399">The Streamer Awards were a mess</a></li> <li><a href="https://kotaku.com/metroid-prime-4-beyond-kotaku-review-is-it-good-120-fps-switch-2-2000651400">And here’s our review of <em>Metroid Prime 4</em></a></li> </ul> <h2>Watch This:</h2>
