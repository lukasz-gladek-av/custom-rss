The complaint argues that while the petition states there are no sources of funding behind it, Scott’s ongoing promotion of the petition essentially amounts to professional contributions from a foreign entity. </p><p>“The €500 disclosure threshold is exceeded by approximately 125-295 times through Scott’s undisclosed professional time contribution, representing potentially the largest single source of campaign support,” the <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://mega.nz/file/W3YTHCqQ#i-D2f_fgILqBILJiavLwX-eh3pUPGnYeaQfdadiFH20&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://mega.nz/file/W3YTHCqQ#i-D2f_fgILqBILJiavLwX-eh3pUPGnYeaQfdadiFH20" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">complaint alleges</a></span>. “The concealment prevents informed citizen participation by misrepresenting the initiative as having no financial backing while substantially depending on foreign professional contributions.”</p><p>The entire argument rests on trying to ballpark the value of Scott’s time at between $55 and $85 an hour and the amount of time at up to almost 2,000 hours. The result is a non-monetary contribution of anywhere from $73,000 to $170,000 in value, the complaint claims. The estimates are based on his YouTube channel and an interview <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.pcgamer.com/gaming-industry/the-stop-killing-games-initiative-is-close-to-its-final-deadline-and-after-that-its-leader-is-understandably-done-either-the-frog-hops-out-of-the-pot-or-its-dead/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.pcgamer.com/gaming-industry/the-stop-killing-games-initiative-is-close-to-its-final-deadline-and-after-that-its-leader-is-understandably-done-either-the-frog-hops-out-of-the-pot-or-its-dead/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Scott did with <em>PC Gamer</em></a></span> in which he said, “I’ve been running a rickshaw carrying people to the destination.” The complaint does not include an estimate for Scott’s hourly rickshaw rate. </p><figure id="" data-id="a28f9184eabc22511831748a31edb701" data-recommend-id="image://a28f9184eabc22511831748a31edb701" data-format="png" data-width="977" data-height="582" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A screenshot shows an EU Commission complaint against Accursed Farms." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><span data-id="a28f9184eabc22511831748a31edb701" data-recommend-id="image://a28f9184eabc22511831748a31edb701" data-format="png" data-width="977" data-height="582" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A screenshot shows an EU Commission complaint against Accursed Farms." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Throughout his latest video detailing the new twist in the ongoing Stop Killing Games saga, Scott tries to make clear that while he supports the EU petition, he’s not one of the organizers behind it, and the overall movement is not a “hive mind.” “The official organizers literally asked EU representatives if it was okay for me to assist them in the capacity I have been back in spring of 2024, just to make sure everything was above board in case there was a problem or we needed to report anything,” Scott says. “They said, ‘What I’ve been doing is fine.’ We’ve been doing this by the book, guys.”</p><p>It’s unclear who is behind the anonymous complaint. It could be someone appealing on behalf of video game companies in Europe whose lobbying entity previously released a statement rejecting the petition’s demands as too onerous and unworkable. Or it could just be some random internet user with an ax to grind against Scott as players debate the Stop Killing Games movement’s merits. </p><p>It was the decommissioning of Ubisoft’s <em>The Crew</em> that originally kicked the whole thing off, and the publisher’s CEO was recently grilled about the movement during its annual shareholder meeting. “The lifespan of a piece of software, whenever there’s a service component, eventually services may be discontinued, because eventually the software may become obsolete over time,” Yves Guillemot <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.gamefile.news/p/ubisoft-ceo-ghost-recon-assassins-creed-shadows-valorant-annual-report&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.gamefile.news/p/ubisoft-ceo-ghost-recon-assassins-creed-shadows-valorant-annual-report" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">said at the time</a></span>. “A lot of tools become obsolete 10 or 15 years down the line. They’re no longer available. And that is why we release a new version. And so we have version two and then version three. But clearly this is a far-reaching issue, and we are working on it.”</p><p>  The EU petition is currently in a good position to actually force action on the issue. According to its organizers, it “seeks to prevent the remote disabling of videogames by the publishers, before providing reasonable means to continue functioning of said videogames without the involvement from the side of the publisher.” If at least 1 million signatures are proved to be authentic, the EU Commission will be tasked with addressing the group’s demands head-on <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.pcgamer.com/gaming-industry/game-development/stop-killing-games-eu-initiative-hits-1-4-million-signatures-and-if-at-least-1-million-are-valid-its-off-to-the-european-commission/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.pcgamer.com/gaming-industry/game-development/stop-killing-games-eu-initiative-hits-1-4-million-signatures-and-if-at-least-1-million-are-valid-its-off-to-the-european-commission/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">within a six-month period</a></span>, even if it ultimately chooses not to create a new regulatory framework around them.</p><p>.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://kotaku.com/accursed-farms-stop-killing-games-eu-petition-ubisoft-1851786660]]></content:encoded>

Ultimately we’ll ship on all platforms, but likely not at the same time!”</p><p>With PS5 currently sitting at around 80 million consoles sold, the Xbox Series X/S, whose hardware revenue within Microsoft falls precipitously every year, is estimated to have sold less than half that. The Switch 2 only just launched, but is already breaking launch records and is expected to continue the momentum of its 155-million-unit-selling predecessor. So if you’re a small team allocating limited resources for porting your PC release, the case for prioritizing Xbox is becoming harder and harder to make. </p><p>The problem’s been pronounced enough that Microsoft published a developer blog post last fall <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/games-skipping-xbox-microsoft-asks-devs-studio-why-ps5-1851663611&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/games-skipping-xbox-microsoft-asks-devs-studio-why-ps5-1851663611">asking studios for feedback</a></span>. “If you are making video games, we’re interested in hearing from you,” it <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/games/articles/2024/09/how-xbox-research-is-shaping-the-future-of-game-development/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/games/articles/2024/09/how-xbox-research-is-shaping-the-future-of-game-development/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">read</a></span>. “If you aren’t on Xbox, we’d love to know why. And honestly, if you are using our competitor’s products, you probably have a great perspective we could learn from!”</p><p>The case of <em>No Rest for the Wicked</em> is especially striking, though, given the size of the team (estimated at over 80 people) and Moon Studios’ history with Xbox. <em>Ori and the Blind Forest </em>was a 2015 exclusive that proved to be a bright spot for the Xbox One as it recovered from its rough launch. The follow-up, <em>Ori and the Will of the Wisps</em>, did the same for the Xbox Series X/S. While both games have since been ported to Switch, neither was ever made available on PlayStation. </p><p><em>No Rest for the Wicked</em>, which swaps snappy 2D platforming for weighty top-down dungeon crawling, will now reverse that trend. I guess there’s no Game Pass deal on the table this time around. <br></p><p>.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://kotaku.com/ori-no-rest-wicked-console-port-souls-rpg-xbox-ps5-1851786659]]></content:encoded>

Coldplay frontman Chris Martin remarked that the couple was either “having an affair or they’re just very shy,” but the internet did what it does best and found out who they were, and the entire thing has played out very publicly and invasively.

Sometimes, there are awkward misunderstandings where the folks behind the camera capture siblings or friends, and they have to flail about so everyone knows they’re not a couple. But right now, all anyone seems to want to do is run away from the camera to reference the now-infamous scene. Some venues are even encouraging it, searching for couples who are embracing the same way the caught couple was at Coldplay’s show. One of the funnier examples was when the Phillie Phanatics’ mascots unexpectedly re-enacted the whole thing shot for shot.</p><p>The whole situation has split the internet.
