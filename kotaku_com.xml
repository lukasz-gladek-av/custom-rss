              <p>After a run collecting some of the best loot of your life, getting unexpectedly downed in&nbsp;<em>Arc Raiders</em> is one of the worst feelings. But perhaps a player is taking things a&nbsp;<em>smidgen</em> too seriously when they scream so loudly for help that a neighbor tries to kick their door down in panic.</p> <p>In&nbsp;<em>Arc Raiders</em>, running out of health doesn’t mean instant death but rather falling belly-first to the ground, able only to crawl at a brutally slow pace while a timer ticks down until your complete death. You can no longer access your inventory, there’s no way to heal yourself with your bandages, and your only hopes are to reach an escape hatch or be revived by a fellow player. When you’re carrying some top-notch loot, perhaps exactly the items you’ve needed for so long to upgrade a workbench, this can be agonizing. Crawling to safety can sometimes be achieved, and it’s one of the most rewarding moments in the game, but it’s very unlikely. And when that timer runs out, you’re going to lose <em>everything</em> you have with you, likely including some favorite fully-upgraded weapons. It makes sense to be upset. It makes sense to shout out to other players for help.</p>

 <p>Perhaps not too loudly, however. As <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/arc-raiders-player-calls-for-help-during-game-gets-door-kicked-in-by-concerned-neighbour">spotted by&nbsp;<em>Eurogamer</em></a>, one&nbsp;<em>Arc Raiders</em> player posted doorbell footage to Reddit of their neighbor knocking on their door in concern after hearing appeals for help, asking, “Y’all good?” and hearing, “Help me! Somebody help me!” come from inside. He then steps back and prepares to kick the door down.</p>

 <p>“My heart just about jumped out of my chest when I saw the door bulge like an explosion was behind it,” Reddit user Dreamthorp noted below the video footage.</p>   <p>It’s actually even worse than that. This wasn’t Dreamthorp’s home. He was house-sitting for a friend at the time, and thankfully the incredibly splendid neighbor (who it turns out is a firefighter) didn’t manage to kick through the door. The home’s owner apparently thought it was “hilarious,” and Dreamthorp noted that “if it was damaged in the slightest I’d buy him a new door at the very least.”</p>

 <p>It’s probably a good job front doors don’t collapse when kicked a single time like they do in the movies, given how little protection that would offer your home. Apparently the video cuts where it does as from that point on there was just a black screen, but it does to protect the embarrassment of the kindly hero as he likely bounced off it.</p>

 <p>“For context,” says the&nbsp;<em>Arc Raiders</em> player, “I was in a night raid on dam trying to extract from an elevator when a leaper landed on me and downed me right before the extract door shut. I just wanted to get stabilized so I could leave.”</p>

 <p>Dreamthorp thanked the friend’s neighbor by dropping off a six-pack outside his door.</p>   <p>Naturally, many on Reddit are skeptical, especially given the video cuts off before the kick, but Dreamthorp swears up and down that it’s real. I much prefer the reality where he’s telling the truth, so I’m opting to live in that one.</p>

              <p>Things get so busy during day-to-day life because there’s always something new to tackle. A great computer or tablet can make juggling it all a little less frustrating.</p>
<p>If you’re looking for a single 2-in-1 device that provides the ability to perform real-world work and has the qualities of a tablet, the Microsoft Surface Pro 2-in-1 Laptop/ Tablet (2024) is that choice. This 13-inch Copilot+ PC comes with a very clear, interactive touch-screen that converts to a canvas, notebook and full laptop upon attaching a keyboard. With the Surface Pro 2-in-1 Laptop/Tablet (2024), you can replace an old laptop and a tablet with one light weight device that is highly versatile.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6668/">You can purchase the Microsoft Surface Pro 2-in-1 Laptop/Tablet (2024) on Amazon today for $989.99 which is $510 less than the original price of $1,499.99 or 34% off.</a></p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6668/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>A flexible laptop and tablet hybrid for plenty of use cases</h2>
<p>Your first impression of the device will be of the 13-inch touch-screen display. The large 13 inch screen allows for ample amounts of viewing area for multiple applications open at the same time, viewing high definition images and reading comfortably. The clarity of the text is excellent, colors appear vibrant for creative professionals, and the aspect ratio of the display offers a wide viewable area for viewing web pages and documents; even watching movies. Additionally, you can use all the normal gestures of a tablet such as tapping, swiping, and pinching, and, when you need to utilize the Surface Pro 2-in-1 Laptop/Tablet as a more conventional laptop, simply place it upright using the built-in kick stand. When paired with a Surface keyboard and Surface Pen, you create a perfect combination for writing and sketching that still makes for a convenient and portable solution to pack in a backpack.</p>



<p>It’s super easy to change form factors if you’re looking to use the Surface Pro 2-in-1 to its full potential. You can use it flat as a tablet to read books, annotate PDF files, or draw pictures. But you can also tilt the Surface Pro 2-in-1 upright with the the kick stand to watch videos, join online meeting/video conferencing sessions, etc., and attach the Surface keyboard when you need to type.</p>
<p>All told, the Surface Pro 2-in-1 Laptop/Tablet (2024) has everything most users need to be a super flexible device. It’s the perfect alternative to an iPad or other on-the-go laptop and tablet, and you won’t have to go broke picking one up if you need that kind of versatility. We suggest picking it up now before it’s all sold out, because you might not see this Surface at such a price point again for some time.</p>
