Their stories typically revolve around someone losing their humanity and sense of self, becoming driven solely by primal instincts to kill—often those they love the most—and death so often seems to be the only way to lift the curse. Or, you know, sometimes it’s about a basketball-playing teenager.</p><p>While werewolf movies may not hold quite the same cultural reverence or popularity as other paranormal entities, there are still some great examples out there that define the genre. With Leigh Whannell’s upcoming remake of <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/new-wolfman-werewolf-universal-halloween-first-look-bad-1851641170&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/new-wolfman-werewolf-universal-halloween-first-look-bad-1851641170"><em>The Wolfman</em></a></span>—following his success with another Universal Studios monster movie remake, <em>The Invisible Man</em>—it feels like the perfect moment to revisit the lycanthrope canon.</p></div></div><div><p>A secluded and idyllic retirement community is rocked by deadly attacks, and it’s up to one of the residents—a blind, weather-worn veteran superbly played by Nick Damici—to lead the charge in defeating the hairy, bloodthirsty fiends. While <em>Late Phases</em> delivers plenty of gore, it lingers too much on the family drama without delivering enough scares, made worse by the special effects, which, while ambitious for a smaller indie film and admirably practical, lack realism. However, <em>Late Phases</em> does offer some thoughtful commentary on how the elderly are forgotten and neglected by society—even by their own family members.</p></div><div><p><em>Scooby-Doo and the Reluctant Werewolf</em> is a playful and family-friendly take on werewolves. The attention-grabbing title refers to Shaggy, who is turned into a werewolf by Dracula, no less, and has to reverse the curse by winning a monster road rally. It’s a funny concept because poor Shaggy is the last person that wants to have his routine of eating good snacks interrupted by becoming the type of monster he’s always scared of! I was obsessed with this movie as a kid and it still holds up today, offering a lot of clever gags and wacky shenanigans where the gang isn’t focused on solving a mystery but more on helping Shaggy break free from his hairy predicament. </p></div><div><p>The 1957 film<em> I Was a Teenage Werewolf</em> popularized the trope of the werewolf transformation as an allegory for puberty, self-discovery, and the loss of innocence during adolescence. <em>Teen Wolf</em> embraces this idea with ‘80s-style goofy antics. If you’re looking for a werewolf movie that’s less horror and more lighthearted fare, you can’t do better than <em>Teen Wolf</em>, which features the teenage lycanthrope surfing on top of a van to The Beach Boys’ “Surfin’ U.S.A.” Scott’s transformation leads him to become more popular, attract girls, and, somewhat inexplicably, excel at basketball. Thanks to Michael J. Fox’s boyish charm, the movie remains fun to watch, even as its silliness occasionally veers into stupidity.</p></div><div><p>Released the same year as the far superior <em>An American Werewolf in London</em>, <em>The Howling</em> also boasts impressive special effects, but it straddles the line between camp and horror with less finesse. Directed by <em>Gremlins</em>’ Joe Dante, this satirical take on cults and media sensationalism follows a television journalist (Dee Wallace) who, after helping the police catch a serial killer, is sent to a psychiatric retreat for recovery. Karen discovers there’s something more—and possibly supernatural—to the story. </p><p>The makeup and special effects, initially handled by Rick Baker before he left to work on <em>An American Werewolf in London</em>, were taken over by Rob Bottin. They are impressive, especially the formation of the protruding snout. However, some aspects like the bubbling in his face, enter silly territory, even with the unsettling bone cracking sounds. The constant cutting back and forth to Karen doesn’t help, either, because it takes so long for the scene to unfold that the transformation ends up being boring rather than scary. Still, <em>The Howling</em> remains an enjoyable, quintessentially ‘80s werewolf movie.</p></div><div><p>Amy Adams delivers yet another awards-worthy performance in <em>Nightbitch</em>, a feminist, quasi-werewolf film that highlights everything wrong with modern motherhood—the pressures of losing your identity, feelings of isolation, and little societal support. <em>Nightbitch</em> addresses these real-life issues with honest empathy and the supernatural elements with more absurdity. Nevertheless, it’s refreshing to see a werewolf movie that uses the metaphor in an entirely different way. The stay-at-home mom’s nightly transformations make sense because motherhood can become all about control and maintaining a perfect image, when what you really want is to release your rage and the intensity of your feelings. <em>Nightbitch </em>transforms the werewolf myth into something more contemporary and relatable—not just stories of tragic male heroes.</p></div><div><p><em>The Wolfman </em>had a lot of production problems, including a change in director, a new composer, re-shoots, budget inflation, all pushing back production schedules, and even faced cuts to reduce graphic content. But in the end, Joe Johnston’s retelling of <em>The Wolfman</em> is a Gothic thrill ride with lacerating violence and a brooding central performance from Bencio del Toro. He gives anguished layers to Lawrence Talbot, who travels to his ancestral home of Blackmoor in search for his missing brother only to become part of a supernatural family curse after being bitten by a werewolf. </p><p>While the film teeters between Rick Baker’s incredible makeup work and some shoddy CGI, the transformation and kill scenes are a thrilling mix of frightening and gory fun. The 1800s setting adds to the Gothic mystique, perfectly suited for an epic climax in aristocratic London, a time when legends and folklore were often considered closer to truth than fiction.</p></div><div><p>A podunk Utah town is shaken by a series of mysterious deaths that happen after each full moon. Writer, director, and star Jim Cummings once again proves he’s one of the best independent filmmakers out there, masterfully merging quirky dark comedy with grisly mystery and mischief. <em>The Wolf of Snow Hollow </em>is more than just a blood-soaked werewolf movie; it’s also a compelling character study, with Cummings playing a self-destructive alcoholic, and a touching father-son story, with the great Robert Forster playing his father. The film’s take on toxic masculinity is perfectly suited for a werewolf mythology about someone (mainly men) turning into the wildest version of themselves, driven by pure aggression, violence, and unbridled desire.</p></div><div><p><em>The Wolf Man</em> is a must-see classic that set the standard for werewolf cinema. The stark black-and-white cinematography, combined with forest landscapes cloaked in mist and images of fortune tellers and tarot cards, all work together to create an atmosphere of Gothic horror. Actor Lon Chaney Jr. was no stranger to monster movies, having played The Frankenstein Monster, The Mummy, and The Invisible Man, but there’s something about his portrayal of Larry Talbot-turned-Wolf Man that feels more somber. He brings to life a tortured soul unwittingly possessed by a savage creature. The makeup by Jack Pierce highlights his humanity, even in his animalistic form, which makes his curse all the more horrifying—as if he’s doomed to live in limbo, never fully belonging to either world. This also makes the tragic ending feel all the more poignant.</p></div><div><p>Female werewolves are not as common in horror, but <em>Ginger Snaps</em> is one of the few films that smartly pairs the supernatural curse with another real-life “curse” that most young women undergo: getting their first period. The story follows a pair of outcast sisters with a taste for the macabre and a desire to escape the mundanity of suburbia. After Ginger (Katharine Isabelle) is bitten by a dog, she goes through odd changes, becoming more aggressive, hypersexual, and menstruating heavily. </p><p><em>Ginger Snaps</em> skillfully interweaves themes of girlhood with lycanthropic folklore, such as questioning whether a silver navel piercing can offer a cure or seeking animalistic revenge on the cruel, bullying popular girls. With its feminist edge, <em>Ginger Snaps</em> is a sharp and wickedly funny take on teenage humiliation, not only a fierce werewolf film but also a great coming-of-age story.</p></div><div><p>There’s no other werewolf movie quite like John Landis’<em> An American Werewolf in London</em>. American tourists David and Jack (David Naughton and Griffin Dunne) are attacked by a werewolf after the locals warn them, “Beware the moon.” After Jack’s death, David is plagued by gruesome, surreal nightmares and eventually undergoes a terrifying transformation. The film brilliantly balances jet-black comedy—where ghosts tell David with a cheerful smile, “just put the gun to your forehead and pull the trigger”—with disturbing body horror. The transformation scene featuring the iconic work of makeup artist Rick Baker puts any other werewolf movie to shame. </p><p>The use of his incredible prosthetics makes the scene feel more real, tangible, and frightening. The way David lies on the floor with his newly hair-covered, animal-like hind legs twitching, and lets out a horrified screen—it is absolutely haunting. His bloodthirsty rampage across London culminates in one of the most ironic and hilarious music cue/smash cut combinations ever. <em>An American Werewolf in London</em> remains the ultimate werewolf movie—both tragic and darkly hilarious.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Eggman’s loyal-to-a-fault henchman has been a consistent supporting character through all three movies thus far, and <em>Sonic 3 </em>pretty much solidified what had become a long-running fan joke and theory since the first movie premiered in 2020: Agent Stone is absolutely in love with Jim Carrey’s Eggman, and these movies are slow burn toxic yaoi.</p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="194842" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="The Week In Games: System Shock, Street Fighter 6, And More" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="183" data-playlist="194842,196790,195905" data-current="194842"><div><p>The Week In Games: System Shock, Street Fighter 6, And More</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/194842/194842_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/194842/194842_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/194842/194842_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/194842/194842_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/20305.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><figure id="" data-id="afpvuwnfoibrncd6upmy" data-recommend-id="image://afpvuwnfoibrncd6upmy" data-format="png" data-width="800" data-height="88" data-lightbox="true" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><span data-id="afpvuwnfoibrncd6upmy" data-recommend-id="image://afpvuwnfoibrncd6upmy" data-format="png" data-width="800" data-height="88" data-lightbox="true" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>While <em>Sonic 3 </em>presents easily the most emotionally charged version of Agent Stone’s love for Eggman, this guy has been self-destructively devoted to the mad scientist since day one. My god, is it toxic. In the first film, Carrey’s version of Eggman was defined by a mostly grounded superiority complex He’s just a dick to everyone, and that includes Stone. However, Stone’s undying loyalty means he takes it all on the chin, and the dom/sub undertones are not subtle. There’s a scene in which Eggman puts his hand in Stone’s mouth and pulls him close to whisper sweet nothings (unbridled abuse) into his ear. Later, he makes Stone pin himself to a wall as he once again hurls not-so-niceties his way, and the imagery is enough to make even people who are watching the scenes out of context blush.</p><p>It was with <em>Sonic the Hedgehog 2 </em>that the movies dropped any notion of subtlety about how Agent Stone feels about the doctor. After Eggman is jettisoned onto a different planet at the end of the first movie, Stone opens up a coffee shop like a sad widower still hoping to see his husband return from the war. His first scene in the movie has him making latte art of himself and his ex-boss with hearts coming out of it. Gay. We later see more of Stone putting up with abuse, but my guy seems to be enjoying every second of it and still sticks with Eggman through another defeat at the hands of Sonic. By the time <em>Sonic 3 </em>is ready to finally address the abusive elephant in the room, it is some of the angstiest shit in a movie that has Keanu Reeves as a brooding, revenge-driven hedgehog.</p><p>In between all the pop culture references and needle drops, <em>Sonic 3 </em>is probably the most raw of all three movies, and that extends to Stone and Eggman’s relationship. Stone has become a capable protector for his superior, who has entered a deep depression after losing to Sonic last time. But when the doctor meets his grandfather, who seemingly replaces Stone as the most important person in his life, the agent is left abandoned as Eggman goes off to try and conquer the world without him. The “breakup” includes a painful phone call in which Stone pleads with Eggman to come back, saying that he’s not there to protect him from whatever his grandfather is planning and that he “can’t lose [him] again.” I turned to my siblings in the theater to remark about how gay it was. But it all comes to a bittersweet end as Eggman apologizes on a worldwide broadcast just before his apparent death while Stone helplessly watches with the saddest puppy-dog eyes to grace a theater screen. This is the tragic, toxic shit that terabytes of fanfiction and fan art are made of. After the events of <em>Sonic 3</em>, all the long-time Stobonik shippers are having a field day with edits and fanart, and new fans are realizing what they’ve been missing.</p><p>Given Eggman’s supposed death, it’s unclear if Agent Stone will have any role in the next <em>Sonic </em>movie coming in 2027. However, given the character’s popularity, it would be a shame to have one of the few human characters fans seem to universally love go away just as he’s finding himself. Fans are already hoping that Majdoub could return as Stone in the <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.patreon.com/posts/115749707?utm_campaign=postshare_creator&amp;utm_content=android_share&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.patreon.com/posts/115749707?utm_campaign=postshare_creator&amp;utm_content=android_share" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">reported Shadow spin-off</a></span> as the two had some rapport in <em>Sonic 3</em>.
