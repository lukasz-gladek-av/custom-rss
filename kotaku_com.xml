            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Amazon Game Studios has announced that just four years after release, <a href="https://kotaku.com/two-days-with-new-world-amazon-s-extravagant-food-harv-1847777090">its once-popular MMORPG <em>New World</em></a> will no longer receive content updates as it slowly begins its journey to the end.</p> <p>On October 28, shortly after news broke that Amazon was planning to lay off thousands of employees, <a href="https://www.newworld.com/en-us/news/articles/update-on-new-world?tag=updates">Amazon Game Studios posted an update on <em>New World’</em>s official website</a> confirming that the game’s recently launched season 10 and Nighthaven update will be its last. In the post, the devs said that after an “incredible journey” with the community, <em>New World</em> has reached a point where it is “no longer sustainable to continue supporting the game with new content updates.” The MMORPG’s last big content drop, Nighthaven, has been made free to all PC players, as has the game’s <em>Rise of the Angry Earth</em> expansion, which is needed to play Nighthaven.</p> <p><span>“Players of Aeternum: Your dedication and enthusiasm have made this </span><span><i>New World</i></span><span> adventure an unforgettable journey,” said the devs.&nbsp; “We’re deeply grateful for every moment you’ve spent helping build this extraordinary world alongside us. It has been an honor to share Aeternum with you. Thank you for helping make this game something truly special.”</span></p>

 <p>To be clear, <em>New World</em> isn’t shutting down today or any time this year. In an included FAQ, the devs claim players will still be able to play the game normally on all platforms, bug fixes will still happen, and you’ll even be able to keep buying in-game currency. The servers will remain open and operating “through 2026” to allow the community “<span>time to continue their adventures in Aeternum.” The studio says it will provide more details on <em>New World’</em>s future in the coming months and promised to provide a minimum of six months’ notice before shutting down the servers and killing the game completely.&nbsp;</span></p> <p>While <em>New World</em> isn’t dead yet, the writing is on the wall for the MMORPG, <a href="https://kotaku.com/over-populated-new-world-servers-no-longer-allowing-new-1847790460">which at one point was one of the most played games on Steam</a>. In October 2021, <em>New World</em> launched to over <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/1063730/charts/#max">900,000 concurrent players on Steam</a>. It was a genuine smash hit for Amazon, a company that, up until that point, had struggled (and continues to struggle) to break into the game industry. But by March of 2022, player counts slipped into the mid 30-thousands and continued to dwindle. A console port and some big updates over the years helped keep <em>New World</em> afloat, but it seems like Amazon is finally done spending money on its once-popular MMORPG <a href="https://kotaku.com/amazon-layoffs-lord-rings-mmo-tomb-raider-2000639620">as the retail giant rushes to replace people with AI.</a></p>

              <p>Halloween’s around the corner. Got plans? No? I’m not much of a costume party person myself, so I’ll be staying in to play a bunch of spooky games, and one that has recently caught my attention features a lovely injection of PSX-style retro grunge that I struggle to not just stare into for hours as I contemplate the grim realities of existence. Sound up your alley? Good.</p> <p><i>Labyrinth of the Demon King</i> arrived earlier this year on console and PC. At first glance, I just knew it had to be added to my Steam library. It features that kind of grim, low fidelity <i>dread</i> that the original PlayStation was so good at delivering in games like <i>Silent Hill</i>. It’s dark and moody as hell, making it perfect for late night gaming sessions during the autumn months as the world grows dark and cold.</p>

  <p>A first-person dungeon crawler, expect <i>Demon King</i> to put up a fight. It can feel a little <i>Souls</i>-y with its stamina bar and emphasis on timing your attacks and dodges correctly. Enemies also don’t always go down as easily as you want them to.</p>

 <p>I’m still early on in my trip through the titular labyrinth, but the vibes of this retro-horror experience are easily going to drag me in for many more hours. The game defaults to a 4:3 perspective, reminiscent of the days when we all were gaming on square-ish screens. You can change that to 16:9 or 16:10, which makes it a great option for the Steam Deck’s taller screen format.</p> <p>The game also features a demo, so if you’re curious but aren’t sure about thinning your wallet a touch, it’s easy to jump in. Besides, you need a game to play on Halloween and those annoying kids begging for candy at the door aren’t going to ignore themselves.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/microsoft-satya-nadella-xbox-halo-profit-margins-2000639721</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/microsoft-boss-explains-xbox%E2%80%99s-controversial-new-approach-to-gaming.1337557/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Having failed to keep up with PlayStation through two successive hardware generations, Microsoft is <a href="https://kotaku.com/halo-1-remake-combat-evolved-trailer-hwc-teaser-xbox-ps5-2000638911">pivoting Xbox</a> into something other than a conventional console platform. What exact shape that will take remains to be seen, but CEO Satya Nadella just outlined three of the core principles that will seemingly guide this new era of Microsoft gaming.</p> <p>The executive, who’s currently on track to rake in almost $100 million <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2025/10/21/microsoft-ceo-satya-nadellas-total-comp-rises-to-96point5-million.html">in fresh equity awards</a>, started by reminding daily business show TBPN that the biggest gaming business in the world remains the Windows business. Everything else, including Steam, is built on top of that. And following the acquisition of Activision Blizzard, Microsoft is one of the biggest gaming publishers in the world. In other words, the Xbox brand <a href="https://kotaku.com/xbox-game-pass-cancel-controversy-console-pc-2000631061">might be in shambles</a>, but Microsoft Gaming is bigger than ever. From there, Nadella laid out the company’s evolving approach to exclusivity, interactive content, and hardware.</p>

 <p>“We want to be a fantastic publisher, similar to the approach of what we did with Office,” he <a href="https://x.com/tbpn/status/1983231937306354078">told TBPM</a> (via <a href="https://www.threads.com/@stephentotilo/post/DQXXIhPkd65"><em>Game File</em></a>). “We’re going to be everywhere, on every platform. We want to make sure, whether it’s consoles, whether it’s the PC, whether it’s mobile, whether it’s cloud gaming, or the TV, so we just want to make sure the games are being enjoyed by gamers everywhere.”</p>

 <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">Satya Nadella says he wants Xbox gaming to be like Microsoft Office: everywhere. </p> <p>Says the best way to innovate is through strong profit margins that can support risk taking. </p> <p>Calls for new forms of interactive entertainment to compete with short form video. <a href="https://t.co/pRbIqncXCc">pic.twitter.com/pRbIqncXCc</a></p> <p>— AmericanTruckSongs9 (@ethangach) <a href="https://twitter.com/ethangach/status/1983264670502006799?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 28, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <p>He continued,</p> <blockquote><p>Second, we also want to do innovative work in the system side on the console and on the PC. And it’s kind of funny that people think about the console-PC as two different things. We built the console, because we wanted to build a better PC, which could then perform for gaming. And so I kind of want to revisit some of that conventional wisdom. But at the end of the day, console has an experience that is unparalleled. It delivers performance that’s unparalleled, that pushes I think, the system forward.</p> <p>So I’m really looking forward to the next console, the next PC gaming, but most importantly the game business model has to be where we have to invent maybe some new interactive media as well. Because, after all, gaming’s competition is not other gaming. Gaming’s competition is short-form video. And so if we as an industry don’t continue to innovate both how we produce, what we produce, how we think about distribution, the economic model—best way to innovate is to have good margins. Because that’s the way you can fund.</p></blockquote> <p>For anyone who’s been <a href="https://kotaku.com/xbox-microsoft-tiktok-switch-ps5-halo-2000639241">paying attention</a> to Xbox over the last 12 months, none of this should come as a shock, though seeing it come straight from Nadella shows there’s no question that these are the new marching orders for Xbox moving forward. While the idea of a next-gen Xbox that sports a more open PC gaming ecosystem offers a lot of promise, <a href="https://kotaku.com/microsoft-next-gen-xbox-pc-windows-rog-ally-2000638181">even if it’s priced at a premium</a>, the talk of higher profit margins shows this new direction comes at a cost.</p>

 <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/xbox-microsoft-price-hike-game-pass-layoffs-new-console-2000638546"><em>Bloomberg</em> recently reported</a> that Microsoft CFO Amy Hood has been mandating a 30 percent profit margin target across Xbox, a sprawling gaming division where not every project is a hit and hardware has traditionally been a lossl eader in the hunt for a future upside in the form of platform fees and reoccurring customer spending. While healthy profits might give Xbox room to experiment in the future, over the last 18 months it’s meant many canceled games and shuttered studios, and thousands of layoffs.</p> <p>Treating <em>Halo</em> like Microsoft Office and shipping it everywhere might be exciting to investors but it’s not going to win much goodwill from existing fans who just saw Game Pass nearly double in price.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/gog-preservation-program-private-detectives-drm-2000635611">Digital PC gaming storefront GOG</a> has looked outside and noticed all the leaves are orange and falling to the ground. So it’s time for a big ol’ Autumn Sale! This year, GOG has marked down over 4,000 PC games, including a whole bunch of classics that are well worth checking out in 2025.</p> <p>On October 28, <a href="https://x.com/Wario64/status/1983173386718019604">as spotted by deals guru Wario64</a>, GOG (formerly known as Good Old Games) <a href="https://www.gog.com/en/promo/autumn_sale_2025?order=desc:bestselling&amp;discounted=true&amp;hideDLCs=true">launched its Autumn 2025 Sale.</a> The sale<a href="https://kotaku.com/steam-fall-autumn-sale-2025-best-biggest-cheapest-deals-games-pc-steamdeck-2000629959">,</a> <a href="https://kotaku.com/steam-fall-autumn-sale-2025-best-biggest-cheapest-deals-games-pc-steamdeck-2000629959">which follows Steam’s fall sale back in late September</a>, runs from now until November 4. So you’ve got about a week to pick through the huge list of discounted games and grab one (or more) to help you endure the coming weeks, which bring cold weather, snow, and family gatherings.</p>

 <p>For those curious to hop into the original<em> Vampire: The Masquerade – Bloodlines</em> ahead of (or perhaps after) playing the <a href="https://kotaku.com/reviews-round-up-vampire-the-masquerade-bloodlines-2-is-it-good-pc-ps5-xbox-2000636600">recently released sequel,</a> you can snag the OG game for just $10. And it, like many of the games on this list, is part of <a href="https://kotaku.com/gog-games-preservation-program-drm-1851696363">GOG’s “Good Old Game” preservation program</a>. That means it and others like it will continue to be maintained and supported by GOG for the foreseeable future, letting you easily play the original <em>Bloodlines</em> for years to come. On the flipside, if the <a href="https://kotaku.com/tron-ares-reviews-rotten-tomatoes-jared-leto-fortnite-2000632606">new <em>Tron</em> movie</a> has you in a cyber mood, just know that<em> Tron 2.0</em> isn’t part of this program. So if you grab this classic PC game as part of the sale, you may want to download some mods to help make it play and run well on modern PCs.</p> <p>Anyway, here’s a list of good games and deals I spotted in <a href="https://www.gog.com/en/promo/autumn_sale_2025?order=desc:bestselling&amp;discounted=true&amp;hideDLCs=true">GOG’s big sale</a>.

            <link>https://kotaku.com/xbox-game-pass-indie-showcase-survival-horror-friendslop-2000639637</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>October brings with it an annual flood of big game releases but a relative desert when it comes to gaming showcases. The <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rtt9pnU_xA">Fall 2025 ID@Xbox livestream</a> did its best to fill that void, teasing updates and new reveal trailers for a number of smaller indie releases you probably don’t have on your radar.</p> <p>If you’re excited as I am <a href="https://kotaku.com/planet-of-lana-follows-in-limbos-lushly-illustrated-foo-1847076146">for <em>Planet of Lana 2</em></a>, you’ll be happy to hear it’s double the length and scope of the original, taking players into <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=trQYZNIOzBE">completely new types of environments</a>. We also got confirmation on some release dates, console ports, and Game Pass day-and-date arrivals. Remember co-op off-road trip <a href="https://kotaku.com/art-rally-over-hill-trailer-minimalist-steam-coop-1851746273"><em>Over the Hill</em></a>? It’s coming to Xbox and PC in 2026. Platformer <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9mcOQY8qhpU"><em>Egg On</em></a>, meanwhile, arrives November 6 via Game Pass on both console and PC. And tower defense roguelike <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7kVZpnNukOU"><em>Monsters Are Coming! Rock &amp;&nbsp;Road</em></a>, which I’ve really been looking forward to, arrives on the subscription service just a few weeks later on November 20.</p>

 <p>Here’s a bunch of other new game trailers that caught our eyes:</p> <h2><em>Puppergeist</em></h2>  <p>Do all dogs go to heaven? Not in this game. <em>Puppergeist</em> sees a young witch named Claire search for her puppy in the underworld. The only way to find him is by helping other haunted dogs with their troubles through rhythm-based mini-games.</p>

 <h2><em>Awaysis</em></h2>  <p>This 1-4 player co-op dungeon brawler hits Game Pass in 2026. It looks like 3D <em>Castle Crashers</em> with bigger maps and detailed physics gags.<em> Awaysis</em> bravely asks you to consider completing that epic combo while trying not to rag-doll across the level.</p>

 <h2><em>Ungodly</em></h2>  <p>Once upon a time, Mark Otero was creative director on <em>Star Wars: Galaxy of Heroes</em>. Now he’s making<em> Ungodly</em>, a dark fantasy RPG from Azra Games. There are barbarians, wizards, and lots of monsters. It looks like an over-the-shoulder dungeon crawler. Unconfirmed if it will be monetized like a free-to-play mobile game or be a complete RPG experience. It was supposed to come out this winter but looks slated for later in 2026 now.</p>

 <h2><em>Task Time</em></h2>  <p><em>Task Time</em> looks like <em>Gang Beasts</em> meats <i>Fall Guys</i>, i.e. it’s a party game that takes place over a series of races in which the best-laid plans are easily ruined by a gnarly physics sandbox. “This is your new favourite friendslop,” reads the YouTube description. See, <a href="https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/focus-group-man-you-have-no-good-car-ideas">they admit it</a>! Still, my kids are going to go crazy for this one, right up until it causes too much chaos and I threaten to never let them play games again.</p>

 <h2 data-cy="title2"><em>Agni: Village of Calamity</em></h2>  <p><em>Agni: Village of Calamity</em> is a horror noir police procedural set in Indonesia where a covert agent goes rogue to uncover a monster-filled conspiracy. It looks cool and creepy, like indie <em>Silent Hill</em> for Indonesian folklore.</p>

 <h2><em>Don’t Fret</em></h2>  <p>In<em> Don’t Fret</em> you play as a human guitar chased by a giant cassette tape. That’s it. That’s the game. It looks lowkey terrifying.</p> <h2><em>Darkwood 2</em></h2>  <p>The top-down survival horror game returns in an equally moody sequel. You make your way around the “scorched deserts of a dying sea” foraging for food and supplies before night falls. It features an entirely new story so you won’t need to have played the first game to enjoy it.</p> <h2><em>Routine&nbsp;</em></h2>  <p>Explore deteriorating environments. Piece together the past. Don’t get eaten by whatever’s lurking around the corner. <em>Routine</em>‘s analog ’80s flavor of survival horror has been in the making since 2012. It finally has a release date of December 4. It’ll also be day-one on Game Pass. Oh, and Mick Gordon (<em>Doom 2016</em>, <em>Doom Eternal</em>) is doing the music!</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><i><span>Dispatch</span></i><span>—the first game from AdHoc Studio, which was formed by veterans of Telltale Games— contains a lot of “almosts.” It’s </span><i><span>almost </span></i><span>a revival of the choice-driven Telltale adventure game we’ve been missing for nearly a decade, but without all the walking around and examining the environment while the game was barely holding itself together. It’s </span><i><span>almost </span></i><span>a superhero story, but it’s mostly a workplace management sim with superheroes in it. It’s </span><i><span>almost </span></i><span>as irreverent as </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/marvel-rivals-deadpool-daredevil-leak-audio-voice-lines-overwatch-2-lady-gaga-2000620344"><i><span>Deadpool</span></i></a><span>, but stops short of its fourth-wall-breaking crudeness. I’m still figuring out how I feel about all of those things rolled together in one package, but I can’t deny I felt a coziness typically reserved for pastel farming sims as I slipped back into the better parts of the Telltale house style.</span></p> <p><span>Robert Robertson III isn’t a superhero, but he </span><i><span>was </span></i><span>a mech-piloting hero who once steered a suit that his father and his father’s father passed down to him. Mecha Man, as the family’s shared heroic identity was known, has become a symbol in a superpowered world where everyone believes they can save the day. So when Robert, voiced by Aaron Paul, is defeated and de-meched by a villain named Shroud, it seems like his heroing days are over. That is, until he is approached by the Superhero Dispatch Network, an organization that assigns heroes to odd jobs based on their various powers and expertise. If Robert can’t be out in the field yet, maybe he can put all those years of hero work to use by guiding others.</span></p>

 <figure id="attachment_2000639683" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000639683"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000639683">© AdHoc Studio</figcaption></figure> <p><span>In just its first two episodes, </span><i><span>Dispatch </span></i><span>has all the makings of an old Telltale classic. While the drama of </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/if-telltale-s-the-walking-dead-its-ending-on-a-high-no-1829281649"><i><span>The Walking Dead</span></i></a> <span>and </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/three-episodes-in-the-wolf-among-us-gets-really-good-1561497397"><i><span>The Wolf Among Us</span></i></a> <span>made </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/telltale-employees-left-stunned-by-company-closure-no-1829272139"><span>the now-defunct studio</span></a><span> a household name, my favorite game by the studio has always been </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/tales-from-the-borderlands-finale-is-its-darkest-episod-1737584368"><i><span>Tales from the Borderlands</span></i></a><span>, which manages to elevate the often tiresome source material into a rollicking action comedy with wit and incredible timing. </span><i><span>Dispatch </span></i><span>feels most reminiscent of that as a slapstick, raunchy workplace comedy where Robert’s co-workers are a gang of superpowered misfits.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><span>I still haven’t gotten much time with Robert’s team, but I’ve seen enough to know they’re different from other groups at SDN. These guys are a bunch of ex-villains, some of whom Robert slapped around in a mech a time or two. As such, his identity is kept under lock and key from most people in the company, so as far as this team is concerned, he’s just another in a long line of paper pushers SDN has brought in to try and wrangle them into a proper superhero team. </span><i><span>Dispatch </span></i><span>will live or die based on whether or not it can pull off the interpersonal relationships between Robert and his crew, and the brief flashes in these first two episodes show potential.</span></p>

 <p><span>Invisigal, formerly known as Invisibitch and played by </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/critical-role-campaign-4-cast-brennan-lee-mulligan-date-2000619230"><i><span>Critical Role</span></i></a> <span>star Laura Bailey, gets the most screen time. Her powers of invisibility allow her to shroud herself in mystery to her foes, like she also does to her friends, and she is pretty much actively rebelling against the entire rehabilitation program, despite turning herself in prior to Robert’s arrival. There will no doubt be a lot to unpack with her as the game goes on, but a lot of the other wannabe heroes are enigmas to me right now. I’ve mostly had to intuit who they are through their stats on a spreadsheet, but thankfully, it sounds like that will change in the next two episodes launching later this week.</span></p>

 <figure id="attachment_2000639684" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000639684"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000639684">© AdHoc Studio</figcaption></figure> <p><i><span>Dispatch </span></i><span>is pretty neatly divided into two halves. One is the “Telltale game” half, playing out as a less interactive version of the choice-driven dialogue and QTEs that defined the studio’s previous work, though here you don’t walk around or interact with the environment at all. The dialogue choices you get will change the cadence of conversations and people “will remember” what you say and do, but overall it’s a much less involved experience. The best parts of </span><i><span>Dispatch </span></i><span>are in the dialogue and the eye-catching comic book-style animation, but so far, the actual experience of playing it feels a little thin.</span></p>

 <p><span>This is especially noticeable because of </span><i><span>Dispatch</span></i><span>’s episodic format. Unlike Telltale’s games or the older </span><i><span>Life Is Strange </span></i><span>releases, which had episodes come out over the course of several months, </span><i><span>Dispatch</span></i><span>’s eight episodes are rolling out weekly, two at a time, between now and November 12. Two episodes are coming out each Wednesday for the next few weeks, and these first two episodes are bite-sized. </span><i><span>Dispatch </span></i><span>was originally going to be a </span><a href="https://www.polygon.com/gaming/611909/dispatch-preview-adhoc-interview/"><span>live-action television show</span></a><span>, and that feels about right given its brief, TV-episode-length run times. I enjoyed my time with both episodes, but I was also caught off guard when they abruptly ended and the credits started rolling. When Telltale or Don’t Nod did the episodic format a decade ago, it was because it was developing episodes and putting the tracks down in real-time. </span><i><span>Dispatch </span></i><span>seems to be mostly done, its episodes just haven’t unlocked yet. Ultimately, when all the episodes are out, will its episodic format really matter? Or is cutting a game into eight pieces mostly just a nod to AdHoc’s lineage? We’ll know for sure in a few weeks, I suppose.</span></p>

 <p><span>But what about the other half of the game, the actual dispatching? What </span><i><span>Dispatch </span></i><span>lacks in more direct control, it makes up for with its pretty entertaining management sim. I was given brief dossiers on my crew and told to send them around town doing heroic things despite their non-heroic attitudes and histories. Surprisingly enough, the big stuff is pretty easy. Baddies are attacking people? Send in Golem, a giant, hulking mud and gunk guy who specializes in defense. Someone needs to reach an objective unnoticed? Probably easiest to send Invisigal because she barely even needs to hide behind cover to get somewhere. It was the smaller jobs that turned out to be more tricky. I thought Invisigal would be able to get a lost balloon out of a tree, but alas, she couldn’t manage it. There was also a point when SDN needed someone to go do some PR, and they decided someone from my group of ex-delinquents would be right for the job. So I had to think a little more creatively about who to send out. There were some obvious non-starters, but Prism is a socialite who dresses like a pop star. She’s probably the one who can sweet-talk the public on a radio show, right?&nbsp;</span></p> <figure id="attachment_2000639682" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000639682"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000639682">© AdHoc Studio</figcaption></figure> <p><span>Getting to know your team’s strengths and weaknesses is one thing, but </span><i><span>Dispatch</span></i><span>’s management segments also require you to juggle the crew’s division of labor, breaks, and travel time all at once like any other shift manager. Sometimes a task needs completion but the right person is resting from their last job, so you have to let it sit there and hope they’ve recuperated before the job times out. Other times you just have to send whoever’s on hand and hope for the best. Some jobs are handled by multiple characters, each of whom can handle certain requirements, but even then, you might get pinged to make a call or hack into a system to help them progress. It’s not all chance, and even someone perfectly suited for a given job isn’t guaranteed success. I’ve been trying to accommodate for some characters’ weaknesses by leveling up different stats like intellect or charisma, so hopefully everyone’s pretty well-rounded and reliable by the game’s end.</span></p> <p><i><span>Dispatch </span></i><span>is doing a lot of things right despite some of my reservations, but regardless of how I feel by the end of episode eight, I’m glad that the Telltale vets at AdHoc are getting to make a game like this again. Despite some bangers like </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/lost-records-bloom-rage-tape-2-review-dont-nod-swann-1851776436"><i><span>Lost Records: Bloom &amp; Rage</span></i></a><span> earlier this year, the episodic narrative adventure genre has largely fallen out of fashion in the years since Telltale fell apart. It’s nice to think these types of games could get a second chance at life, and if </span><i><span>Dispatch </span></i><span>helps get us back to that, I’ll just be happy it exists at all.</span></p>
