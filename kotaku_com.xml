              <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-store-poke-court-nyc-manhattan-robbery-donation-2000662652">The Poké Court</a>, a local <em>Pokémon </em>card and collector’s shop in Manhattan, was <a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-card-shops-robbed-100k-nyc-masked-thieves-anime-backpacks-recently-opened-2000660233">r</a><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-card-shops-robbed-100k-nyc-masked-thieves-anime-backpacks-recently-opened-2000660233">obbed at gunpoint back in January</a>. Armed burglars showed up and terrorized guests during the middle of a crowded event. As traumatic as it was, the employees told <em>Kotaku </em>that the broader<em> Pokémon </em>community showed up to support them. Bust as word spread, Nintendo was apparently made aware of the store has since reached out to the owners to…ask them to change their branding.</p> <p>The shop posted on its <a href="https://www.instagram.com/thepokecourt/p/DU4J-WtkSNT/">Instagram account</a> that Nintendo reached out with “concerns” about its name and logo, which included the iconic red-and-white Poké Ball.&nbsp;“The short story is Nintendo reached out to us with concerns about our name and logo,” the message read. “This means we’re evolving!”</p>

 <p>As such, the owners have released a statement with a new name and logo. The store will now be called The Trainer Court, and now has replaced the Poké Ball logo with a new one with a stylized “C” for “Court.” Beyond that, the store will continue to offer the same cards, community events, and tournaments. The Trainer Court will also be hosting an event on Pokémon Day, February 27, which commemorates the series’ 30th anniversary.</p> <figure id="attachment_2000669829" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000669829"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000669829">© Photo: Kenneth Shepard</figcaption></figure> <p>“Above all, we have always been fans of <em>Pokémon</em>,” the statement reads. “We are a group of kids who refuse to grow up, and we spend every day celebrating this franchise that means so much to us.”</p>

 <p>Nintendo has a history of being litigious about fan creations, events, and businesses, whether that be pretty normal stuff like <a href="https://kotaku.com/another-pokemon-fan-game-says-nintendo-shut-them-down-1790360365">fan games</a>, or more unsavory business <a href="https://kotaku.com/nintendo-switch-2-piracy-lawsuit-streamer-2000640438">like piracy</a>. They certainly didn’t step in when the Department of Homeland Security was using the&nbsp;<em>Pokémon </em>theme song&nbsp;to promote ICE, though.</p>

 <p>The Pokémon Company did <a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-responds-to-dhs-video-using-the-original-animes-theme-2000628222">release a statement to&nbsp;<em>Kotaku</em></a> confirming it wasn’t involved, but the video is <a href="https://kotaku.com/department-homeland-security-ice-pokemon-song-video-2000627900">still up on social media</a> and has received over 75 million views on X alone.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/become-game-sperm-3d-adventure-platformer-trailer-2000669807</link>
            <guid>1438930</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3710850/Become/"><em>Become</em></a>, the upcoming 3D platformer from indie developer Valentin Wirth, is a bildungsroman with a twist. Instead of a story about a young person’s moral journey through adolescence, it’s a game about a sperm cell’s physical journey to beat millions of others in a race for the ultimate prize: the opportunity to fertilize an egg and create life itself. It’s a tale of survival, growth, ingenuity, and self-reflection set inside the human reproductive system. It’s a bildongsroman, folks.</p> <p>Since its announcement, <em>Become</em> has garnered attention (thanks, <a href="https://www.dexerto.com/gaming/indie-game-become-where-you-play-as-sperm-racing-to-create-life-goes-viral-3319593/"><em>Dexerto</em></a>) for its playful treatment of its subject matter and fun visuals. The game’s trailer opens with text that reads “Deep inside the balls” in a <em>Finding Nemo</em>-coded font, and features sperm cells swimming through lush, undersea-like environs while sporting stylish accessories such as cowboy hats and shark costumes. <em>Become</em>‘s Steam page describes the game as a “short single player, third person adventure” in which you must “learn, adapt, and grow stronger as you explore the fascinating but dangerous microcosm of the human reproductive system.”</p>

  <p>Based on the early build showcased in the trailer, that translates to a skill progression system with evocatively (and provocatively) named upgrades like “Busty Bouncer” and “Got Milk.” We’ll leave it up to you to imagine what bonuses those skills might impart on your lil’ guy.</p> <p>Wirth is a first-time solo developer with credits in the cinematic and art departments for games like <a href="https://kotaku.com/mafia-iii-the-kotaku-review-1787722761"><em>Mafia III</em></a> and <a href="https://kotaku.com/crime-boss-rockay-city-impressions-bad-terrible-shit-pc-1850297022"><em>Crime Boss: Rockay City</em></a>. <em>Become</em> is set to arrive on PC sometime in 2026, “If I don’t f*ck it up,” Wirth added in the trailer. Hopefully, both the game and the sperm stay on track for release.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles Magic: The Gathering Cards Are Winning Me Over With Their Big-Time Video Game Vibes]]></title>
            <link>https://kotaku.com/tmnt-mtg-commander-leonardo-donatello-shredder-krang-2000669775</link>
            <guid>1438900</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>I was very skeptical of <a href="https://kotaku.com/magic-gathering-record-final-fantasy-hasbro-2000668256"><em>Magic: The Gathering</em>‘s rapid return</a> to the streets of New York for a <em>Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles</em> pizza party. I still am. But the set is full of a surprising amount of love for the franchise’s strong video game roots that has me softening my stance a bit.</p> <p>I’ve seen all of the <em>Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles</em> movies, played most of the games, watched a ton of the cartoons, read some of the comics, and played with plenty of action figures. I’m a millennial who was old enough to play <em>Turtles</em> in the arcade, watch them on Saturday mornings, and longingly eye the racks of toys in ’90s department stores. What I’m saying is that, as a frequent <em>MTG</em> enjoyer as well, I’m the perfect mark for a <a href="https://magic.wizards.com/en/news/feature/collecting-teenage-mutant-ninja-turtles"><em>TMNT</em> Universes Beyond set</a>.</p>

 <p>But I initially greeted news of the expansion with a groan. <em>MTG</em> fatigue has been setting in on a few different levels. We’re not even six months removed from <a href="https://kotaku.com/mtg-spider-man-ff-prices-ebay-preorder-sold-out-1851767413">last year’s New York-centric <em>Spider-Man</em> set</a>, and just a few months away from a <a href="https://kotaku.com/magic-gathering-mtg-horn-greed-heroic-intervention-2000651812">Marvel Super Heroes expansion</a> bringing more Manhattan flavor to the card game. Plus, there’s the rapid pace of new launches. <em>Avatar: The Last Airbender</em> still feels fresh; <em>Lorwyn Eclipsed</em> seems like it just came out yesterday.</p> <figure id="attachment_2000669819" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000669819"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000669819">Wizards</figcaption></figure> <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/magic-gathering-mtg-star-trek-marvel-avengers-2026-sets-2000629313">It’s too much too soon</a>. <em>TMNT</em> releasing on March 6 only adds to the exhaustion. And yet I can already feel myself coming around thanks to the clever ways Wizards is trying to imbue the set with an identity drawn from multiple sources. Some cards are callbacks to the animated series, some use art from the comics, and others play into moments and aesthetics from the most recent <em>TMNT</em> movie, 2023’s<em>&nbsp;<a href="https://kotaku.com/tmnt-mutant-mayhem-video-game-ninja-turtles-movie-date-1850810080">Mutant Mayhem</a></em>. Each era and sensibility gets some special attention.</p>

 <p>Instead of relying on just the characters and conflicts to drive the lore and flavor, the expansion is effectively a multi-decade tribute to a larger pop-culture phenomenon. Different cards will tug at different parts of players’ nostalgia. For me, it’s the <a href="https://kotaku.com/tmnt-ninja-turtles-best-games-teenage-mutant-mayhem-1850719693/2">video game legacy</a> that has me excited to start ripping packs with friends. The set both calls back to home console and arcade classics and channels that spirit into certain mechanics.</p>

 <figure id="attachment_2000669821" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000669821"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000669821">Wizards</figcaption></figure> <p>First, there’s the borderless pixel art cards which just look really rad. Not only are the characters pixel art but you also get 8-bit-looking color symbols and text box windows. You also have a range of video-game-themed cards like Level Up, which gives you double +1/+1 counters after attacking, and High Score, which lets you draw cards for having the strongest creature on the board. Arcade Cabinet, meanwhile, leans into the +1/+1 counter strategy with a neat four-player nod.</p> <p>Let’s talk about Commander.&nbsp;<em>TMNT</em> introduces a completely novel concept to the popular MTG offshoot: coop. Instead of just one Commander card, you can have two as long as the card has “Partner.” Combine Leonardo and Donatello to create a token +1/+1 counter engine that will make everyone else at the table lose their minds as you try to keep track of your board.</p>

   <p>And then there’s the call-outs to particular <em>TMNT</em> moments unique to the games. Shredder, Shadow Master creates copies of himself like in the arcade game’s final boss fight. The art for Leatherhead, meanwhile, is a riff on the Wild West theme from the alligator’s SNES <em>Turtles In Time</em> appearance. Most iconic of all is a card called Electric Seaweed, a plant wall which will instantly be recognizable and terrifying to everyone who died in the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjUnn3sXt_Q">bomb-defusing level in the NES game</a>.</p> <p>Wizards is having a lot of fun with this set and getting creative in unexpected ways. There are land cards with pizza art where each slice represents a different color based on the toppings. Dr. Baxter’s Mousers are some of the coolest-looking token creature cards out in a while. Krang, a mythic robot, is a perfect stompy creature, as he should be. Would it have been nice if <em>TMNT</em> was still a few months off? Yes. Would I have loved if we only got one Universes Beyond set per year? Absolutely.</p> <p>But Wizards is giving me everything I would have wanted from a <em>Turtle</em>s set. In the meantime, I’m going to go grab a pie and a two liter and fire up the excellent <em>Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: The Cowabunga Collection</em>.</p>

              <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/bethesda-skyrim-port-switch-2-upgrade-free-release-date-trailer-dlc-2000651683"><em>The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim</em> on Switch 2</a> is looking and playing better after a new update added a much-requested 60FPS mode and plenty of fixes and tweaks to the game.</p> <p>In December 2025, <a href="https://kotaku.com/skyrim-elder-scrolls-switch-2-port-60fps-30fps-compare-price-input-lag-fix-patch-2000652156">Bethesda shadowdropped the 15-year-old open-world RPG <em>The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim</em></a> onto the Nintendo Switch 2. But unlike <a href="https://kotaku.com/oblivion-remaster-elder-scrolls-eso-glitch-meme-1851777557">the last time the company surprise released an <em>Elder Scrolls</em> game</a>, the reaction to <em>Skyrim</em> on Switch 2 wasn’t positive. Many players were upset over the game’s poor performance, visual glitches, bugs, and bloated install size. Well, Bethesda has fixed some of these problems with a new update out now on Nintendo’s hybrid handheld.</p> <p>On Tuesday, <a href="https://x.com/BethesdaStudios/status/2023799788936867979">Bethesda released update 1.2 for <em>Skyrim</em> on the Switch 2</a>. The big news is that this free patch added a 60FPS performance mode. Bethesda has also locked <em>Skyrim</em>‘s framerate to 30FPS when playing in “Prioritize Visuals” mode. Either choice should provide a smoother, more stable experience compared to what <em>Skyrim</em> on Switch 2 played like previously.</p>

 <p>In the patch notes for the update shared online on February 17, Bethesda also dedicated two different sections to addressing fixes made to the game’s performance and visual bugs. This includes improved performance in certain areas, like the Talking Stone giant camp and during combat at Secunda’s Kiss. Issues with water not looking correct from a distance or while in a menu have been fixed, too.</p> <p>While it can be frustrating how often <a href="https://kotaku.com/fallout-4s-10th-anniversary-update-is-a-complete-shit-show-that-nobody-wanted-2000642938">Bethesda seemingly breaks their own classic RPGs with updates and ports</a>, I am happy that the studio seems committed to going back and fixing problems. And hey, if Bethesda doesn’t fix it, at least PC players can rely on talented modders to pick up the slack. Switch 2 and other console players are still at the mercy of Bethesda, though.</p> <hr> <p>Here are the full patch notes for the 1.2 <em>Skyrim</em> update on Switch 2:</p> <div dir="ltr"> <p><span

              <p>Developers at Wildlight Entertainment were very open about <a href="https://kotaku.com/highguard-the-kotaku-review-is-it-good-free-ps5-pc-5v5-3v3-update-patch-2000664646"><em>Highguard</em>‘s development</a> back when it launched last month. Everything except where the money to make it came from. A week after mass layoffs at the studio, it’s come out that the source of funding for the hero shooter’s four-year development cycle may have been Chinese conglomerate Tencent.</p> <p>That’s according to a <a href="https://www.gamefile.news/p/tencent-highguard-wildlight-entertainment?utm_source=post-email-title&amp;publication_id=66124&amp;post_id=188295226&amp;utm_campaign=email-post-title&amp;isFreemail=false&amp;r=155iz&amp;triedRedirect=true&amp;utm_medium=email">new report by <em>Game File</em></a>. It claims Tencent studio group&nbsp;TiMi, responsible for online hits like <em>Honor of Kings</em> and military multiplayer shooter <em>Delta Force</em>, is the one backing Wildlight Entertainment.</p> <p>Wildlight was cofounded by <a href="https://kotaku.com/highguard-game-awards-trailer-rust-hero-shooter-interview-2000663137">ex-Respawn Entertainment veterans</a> who worked on<em> Titanfall</em> and <em>Apex Legends</em>. But unlike many recent startups which happily publicize their investment backers, Wildlight has kept that fact a secret. When pressed about the studio’s funding last month <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2026-01-30/-highguard-maker-wildlight-entertainment-talks-about-the-game-s-dramatic-launch">by <em>Bloomberg</em></a>, CEO Dusty Welch said, “We don’t really speak publicly about the business, and the economics and the financials of our company.”</p>

 <p>As <em>Game File</em> points out, it’s unclear why the relationship has been kept secret. Tencent is no stranger to investing <a href="https://kotaku.com/the-world-s-biggest-game-company-just-keeps-getting-big-1826294558">in Western game studios</a> and companies. It has billions in holdings across companies big and small, from Larian Studios and FromSoftware to Epic Games and Ubisoft. Usually these are just partial financial stakes. In Wildlight’s case, TiMi appears to have been the primary backer.</p> <p>Questions about the funding have taken center stage following Wildlight’s layoffs last week and fan questions about just how much longer the live-service game <a href="https://kotaku.com/highguard-layoffs-dead-game-awards-live-service-2000668192"><em>Highguard</em> can continue</a> in its current state. It’s lost over 95 percent of concurrent players on PC from its peak at launch, even as an unknown pool continues to play on console.</p>

 <p>As a free-to-play shooter, its revenue comes entirely from in-game microtransactions for skins and battle passes, things players are much less likely to buy when they think a game won’t stick around. Wildlight has yet to update players on the game’s revised roadmap or future plans and today, <em>Highguard</em>‘s official website was discovered to <a href="https://kotaku.com/highguard-website-down-shutting-down-servers-free-to-play-shooter-steam-playercount-2000669734">have been taken offline</a>.</p>
