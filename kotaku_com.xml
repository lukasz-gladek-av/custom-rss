              <p>It’s felt like it’s been a while since Sony’s <a href="https://kotaku.com/playstation-5-2025-ghost-yotei-sales-plus-price-hike-2000653527">last big gaming showcase</a>. We’ve had smaller ones but nothing that felt like a real preview of the PlayStation 5’s next chapter. That seems like it’s about to change. Sony confirmed there’s a new State of Play airing later this week and it’s a long one.</p> <p>It starts at 5:00 p.m. ET on February 12 and will run over an hour. “Tune in live this Thursday for 60+ minutes of news, gameplay updates, and announcements from game studios across the globe,” reads an announcement <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2026/02/09/state-of-play-returns-this-thursday-february-12/">on the PlayStation Blog</a>. “February’s State of Play will spotlight eye-catching third-party and indie games headed to PS5, along with the latest from teams at PlayStation Studios.”</p>

 <p>Unlike some State of Play showcases that focus on a specific game, third-party publishers, or PS VR (remember those?), this one looks like it has the potential to include everything. Does that mean we’ll finally hear about a rumored new<a href="https://kotaku.com/god-of-war-sony-santa-monica-cory-barlog-2000618215"> <em>God of War</em> game</a> or get our first tease of <em>Final Fantasy VII Remake</em> part three? Possibly. News on this year’s already announced blockbusters, like Insomniac’s <em>Wolverine</em>, is a safer bet.</p> <p>Earlier today, the Latin America PlayStation Store briefly <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GamingLeaksAndRumours/comments/1qzjskk/the_latin_american_playstation_store_lists/">appeared to leak a third quarter release window</a> for the new Marvel action game, suggesting it’ll arrive sometime over the summer between July and September. Other upcoming Sony published games include Housemarque’s roguelike shooter<em> Saros</em> and Arc System Works’ fighting game <em>Marvel Tōkon: Fighting Souls</em>. The <em>Halo Combat Evolved</em> remake is also coming to PS5 in 2026. Will it be Microsoft’s debut at a Sony showcase? Stranger things have happened at this point.</p>
