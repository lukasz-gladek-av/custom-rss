            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Do you want to work on <em>Palworld</em>? Do you have an embarrassingly long Steam history to prove it? Will BioWare use a similar test to hire its new production director for <em>Mass Effect 5</em>? And can the next <em>Monster Hunter Wilds</em> patch finally fix performance on PC? It’s the latest edition of Morning Checkpoint,<em> Kotaku</em>‘s daily roundup of gaming news, rumors, and culture. This is my new favorite <a href="https://x.com/tct_adventures">behind the scenes game tease</a>. Game companies should spend less time firing people and more time being silly.</p> <h2>Gamers without Steam achievements need not apply</h2> <p>What makes a good game designer? For<em> Palworld</em> maker Pocketpair it’s people who play a lot of Steam games and can explain why their favorite ones are good. Don’t have a Steam game history? Don’t even bother applying. CEO Takuro Mizobe says people have to submit screenshots of their playtime and those without any are screened out.</p>

 <p>“In the interview, we ask them to explain the game mechanics of the titles that rank high in their Steam playtime, why they think those specific mechanics were adopted, and what makes that title stand out when compared to other games in the same genre,” Mizobe <a href="https://x.com/urokuta_ja/status/2014593734827246006">wrote on X</a> (via <a href="https://automaton-media.com/en/news/palworld-developer-pocketpair-requires-game-designer-candidates-to-provide-screenshots-of-their-steam-libraries-and-playtime-according-to-ceo/"><em>Automaton</em></a>). “Pocketpair is recruiting game creators who are true Steam gamers!”</p> <h2><em>Monster Hunter Wilds</em>‘ next big performance patch arrives next week</h2> <p>“This patch will include optimization improvements for Steam-specific processes and options to reduce processing load,” reads an <a href="https://x.com/MHStatusUpdates/status/2011732622435557475?s=20">announcement on the server status account</a> for an outage starting January 27. “It will also include a review of presets.” Another update will follow quickly after on February 18. Fans are hoping this is the one that finally makes a big difference with how the game runs on PC, especially after one modder apparently discovered <a href="https://kotaku.com/monster-hunter-wilds-pc-performance-framerate-dlc-2000660149">a weird DLC check bug</a> that was killing framerates.</p>

 <h2>BioWare is hiring for <em>Mass Effect 5</em></h2> <p>“We are looking for a Production Director&nbsp;with a passion for the&nbsp;<em>Mass Effect</em>&nbsp;universe to serve as a high-impact leader on our next&nbsp;<em>Mass Effect</em> title,” reads a new job posting. “You will partner closely with creative leadership, studio teams, and internal and external partners to champion the game’s vision and ensure its execution at the highest quality bar.” That person will report directly to project lead Michael Gamble. “It’s gonna be awesome,” he <a href="https://x.com/GambleMike/status/2014438853273387358?s=20">wrote on X</a>.</p>

 <h2><em>Vampire Crawlers</em> will have a free demo next month</h2> <p>The <em>Vampire Survivors-</em>turned-3D-deckbuilder dungeon crawler spin-off will be free-to-try starting on February 23 on Steam and Xbox Game Pass. The 3D pixel-art genre mash-up has been looking very neat and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Ael4oMaKQM">has a new trailer</a> explaining more of how its gameplay will work.</p> <h2>Epic has a secret $800 million deal with Google</h2> <p>“Epic’s technology is used by many companies in the space Google is operating in to train their products, so the ability for Google to use the Unreal Engine more fulsome…sorry, I’m blowing this confidentiality,” CEO Tim Sweeney told a court questioning its settlement with the search giant, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/policy/866140/epic-google-fortnite-android-unreal-deal-antitrust-settlement"><em>The Verge</em> reports</a>. The deal, which is for Epic buying Google’s services, is apparently related to “the metaverse” and will include both companies marketing one another’s products. It’s definitely not part of some sweetheart arrangement of the kind that Sweeney <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23996474/epic-tim-sweeney-interview-win-google-antitrust-lawsuit-district-court">previously railed against</a>.</p> <h2>ICYMI:</h2> <ul> <li><strong><a href="https://kotaku.com/ubisoft-share-price-crash-prince-of-persia-ai-2000662169">Ubisoft’s stock is on life support&nbsp;</a></strong></li> <li><strong><a href="https://kotaku.com/yakuza-3-remake-ugly-alleyway-has-fans-concerned-graphics-downgrade-fix-mod-2000662269">Fans can’t figure out why one of the<em> Yakuza 3</em> remake’s back alleys is so ugly</a></strong></li> <li><strong><a href="https://kotaku.com/alan-wake-2-steam-epic-games-publishing-deal-tim-sweeney-2000662259">Remedy defends Tim Sweeney’s honor over <em>Alan Wake 2</em> not being on Steam</a></strong></li> </ul> <h2>Watch this:</h2>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><span>During yesterday’s </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/xbox-developer-direct-fable-forza-horizon-6-game-freak-2000662291"><span>Xbox Developer Direct</span></a><span>, we got the most expansive look at the </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/fable-reboot-features-open-world-release-date-fall-xbox-ps5-2000662295"><i><span>Fable </span></i><span>reboot</span></a><span> we’ve seen yet. Playground Games is picking up the series after original developer Lionhead Studios shut down in 2016, and it definitely feels like the studio is modernizing the action RPG series with an open world and a new morality system. With that new morality system, </span><i><span>Fable </span></i><span>is changing what was one of the core pillars of the series: your appearance will no longer be determined by whether or not you’re making good or evil decisions. In fact, it’s abandoning the idea that any of your actions are objectively good or evil altogether.</span></p> <p><span>For those that didn’t play any of Lionhead’s </span><i><span>Fable </span></i><span>games, like many games of the early 2000s they have a binary “hero or villain” morality system where doing things like helping people in need would move you toward the “good” side of the spectrum while doing things like skinning people alive in front of their weeping mother would move you toward the “evil” side. </span></p>

 <p><span>In the </span><i><span>Fable </span></i><span>games, the decisions you made would gradually alter your character’s look, with good characters appearing pristine and almost angelic, and evil players growing horns and turning into a monster. I tended to play evil characters in these games and wasn’t thrilled that my characters were turning into uggos, but that’s the contract you sign when you play these games. Playground Games’ </span><i><span>Fable</span></i><span>, however, is approaching morality differently, and so this mechanic is going out the window.</span></p> <p><span>As illustrated in the showcase, </span><i><span>Fable </span></i><span>is trying to handle morality in a more “subjective” way, which essentially means the game won’t treat your actions as simply “good” or “evil,” but rather that NPCs will react to the things you do based on their own proclivities. So you can kick people out of their homes as their landlord, and some rich idiot who lives for that shit might still think you’re a standup guy. Since things aren’t so black and white this time around, Playground’s Ralph Fulton tells </span><a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/weve-been-working-on-this-game-for-a-really-really-long-time-the-big-fable-interview-with-microsoft-developer-playground"><i><span>IGN</span></i></a><span> it’s abandoning the morality-based appearance-changing system of previous games because there is no “objective” morality system to attach them to.</span></p>

 <blockquote><p><span>That sort of character morphing feature, obviously a really central part of the original games. It’s not in ours. And I’ll tell you why. There’s probably a couple of reasons. One, I guess it’s about that high level principle I was talking about, that there is no objective good and evil. And the original games were predicated on there being an objective good and an objective evil, and you were somewhere along that scale, and that’s what determined how your appearance changed.</span></p> <p><span>But for us, that doesn’t really work. The way I’ve described our morality system working, you’re never that thing, absolutely. You’re different things to different people based on what they like or what they choose to value. So, that’s one reason that it didn’t work.</span></p> <p><span>There’s another reason, which is in our game, you build reputation based on the settlement, the town, the city that you’re in, the part of the world that you’re in. But when you go to a new place, a place you’ve never been to before, you walk in without any reputation and thus nobody knows what to think about you. And you can almost, through your behavior, through your choices, form completely different reputations, a completely different identity, if you like, in that place from the place that you were last time. And you can do that across all the locations in the game.</span></p> <p><span>Now, you couldn’t do that if you walked in with horns and a trident. Your reputation would precede you in that instance. And honestly, that ability to be completely in control of your identity and thus what people think of you felt more important to us than that legacy feature. So, it worked great in those games. It didn’t seem to fit in ours, so we don’t have it.</span></p></blockquote> <p><span>From a roleplaying perspective, I get why this decision was made, and I’ll be glad that </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/baldur-s-gate-3-cyberpunk-mass-effect-character-creator-1851422575"><span>my future bald, bearded gay</span></a><span> won’t have to look like a demon while I’m trying to woo the men of Albion. But it is leaving behind what was a core pillar of the </span><i><span>Fable </span></i><span>series back in the day, and long-time fans who have been waiting over a decade for a new </span><i><span>Fable </span></i><span>are reacting accordingly.</span></p>

   <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">they've confirmed in an IGN interview that your actions will not transform your appearance. 😠 That's a core part of why I love Fable and I'll miss that.</p> <p>Everything else looks fantastic, though. Smart evolutions, faithful vibe, incredible environments. I'm happy to be excited. <a href="https://t.co/aqiDTHLR2o">https://t.co/aqiDTHLR2o</a></p> <p>— Jake Baldino (@JakeBaldino) <a href="https://twitter.com/JakeBaldino/status/2014445728001630593?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 22, 2026</a></p></blockquote>  <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">wait what?? that's like Fable's whole deal! <a href="https://t.co/E9mzl8OvZO">https://t.co/E9mzl8OvZO</a></p> <p>— Paul Tassi (@PaulTassi) <a href="https://twitter.com/PaulTassi/status/2014470703605584029?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 22, 2026</a></p></blockquote>  <p><span>“NPC’s and how your character looked reflecting your actions was pretty important for me,” Disastrous_Fig5609 wrote on </span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Fable/comments/1qk9zj3/rip_to_the_main_feature_that_set_fable_games_apart/"><span>Reddit</span></a><span>. “You watch the character grow up from childhood, then you watch them grow into a hero or a villain. You might not be able to plant an acorn and watch it grow into a tree as you play the game, but that element of shaping the world around you with your actions still somewhat persisted with shaping your character with your actions.”</span></p> <p><span>“The location based reputation is cool, but it absolutely could have just been a dual system,”&nbsp; ForestBrah01209 wrote in the same thread. “One town will see you one way, another town will see you a different way. However, if I’m absolutely evil and move to another town, I’m still absolutely evil, even if my new neighbors think I’m just another stranger or even a nice guy. Shame that I won’t be able to rock the devil horns anymore.”</span></p>

 <p><i><span>Fable </span></i><span>is the first game in the series to have a character creator, so at least it’s not like everyone’s characters are going to look the same. We’ll see if there are enough character customization options to let players at least manually emulate some of those old </span><i><span>Fable </span></i><span>transformations when the game launches in the fall. </span></p>

Night vision keeps you seeing a high-quality image regardless of the time of day.

            <title><![CDATA[Bose Goes on ANC Headphone Clearance, New QuietComfort Ultra Earbuds (2nd Gen) Crash to an All-Time Low]]></title>
            <link>https://kotaku.com/bose-goes-on-anc-headphone-clearance-new-quietcomfort-ultra-earbuds-2nd-gen-crash-to-an-all-time-low-2000662534</link>
            <guid>1414327</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>The Bose New QuietComfort Ultra Earbuds feature an Active Noise Control system and an immersive audio system, and they fit well for extended periods. They also include soft ear tips that seal against the ear to eliminate ambient noise, but do not feel too tight. These earbuds feature Bluetooth compatibility for phones, tablets, laptops, and other devices. Additionally, the earbuds have a white smoke finish, have touch controls, and a compact charging case that is small enough to carry in a pocket. They were made to be portable while keeping the audio front and center.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6849/">You can find the Bose New QuietComfort Ultra Earbuds for $249 at Amazon.</a> This is a $50 discount from their normal price of $299. So this represents a 17% discount.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6849/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Earbuds with the style, comfort, and quality of Bose headphones</h2>
<p>The noise-cancellation on the Bose New QuietComfort Ultra Earbuds works to cancel out engine noise, conversations, and other background noise. If you would rather hear some outside noise, then the Aware Mode provides an alternative. It allows you to hear what is happening outside and smooths out sudden spikes in decibel levels caused by loud noises, such as clanging dishes and slamming doors. In addition to providing awareness of your surroundings, if you prefer more isolation, Quiet Mode reduces ambient noise so you can enjoy your playlists, calls, podcasts, etc., at a lower volume.</p>
<p>CustomTune technology in the Bose New QuietComfort Ultra Earbuds determines how sound behaves in your ears and adjusts noise cancellation and equalization accordingly. The earbuds produce a test tone when you insert them and measure the response. Then it sets the bass, midrange, and treble to match your ear shape. Bose Immersive Audio provides a spatial effect that creates the illusion that music and video are coming from in front of you rather than inside your head.</p>



<p>The fit and comfort of the earbuds are due to the combination of the soft silicone eartips and the flexible stability bands. There are multiple sizes of each component, and they can be combined in 9 ways. The umbrella-shaped tips provide additional blockage of ambient noise. Plus, they are rated IPX4, so they are suitable for use during sweating or light rain.</p>
<p>The call quality of the Bose New QuietComfort Ultra Earbuds depends on the noise-rejecting microphones and processing specifically tailored to ensure your voice is heard clearly. The microphones are focused on capturing your voice while rejecting wind and background noise; therefore, the caller hears you, not the surrounding noise.</p>
<p>As mentioned earlier, battery life and charging capabilities are configured to provide you with enough time to listen to whatever content you desire. Battery life is approximately 6 hours in Quiet, Aware, or Immersive Modes, and about 4 hours in Immersive Mode. The case supports 3 charging cycles and can be charged via a USB-C port or a wireless charging pad. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6849/">These are great headphones, and you’ll want to take advantage of the $249 sale price instead of the regular list price of $299 now.</a></p>
