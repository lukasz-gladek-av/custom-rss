            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>For the last few weeks, I’ve been playing Obsidian Entertainment’s <a href="https://kotaku.com/outer-worlds-2-review-rpg-xbox-ps5-2000638368"><em>The Outer Worlds 2.</em></a> I really like it! And after wrapping the game up over the weekend, I realized that I just played the closest thing to <em>Fallout 5</em> that I’ll get until Bethesda finally ships the wasteland RPG in, like, a decade from now.</p> <p><em>The Outer Worlds 2,</em> out now on Xbox, PlayStation, and PC, is the much bigger and better follow-up to Obsidian’s original<a href="https://kotaku.com/games/the-outer-worlds"><em> Outer Worlds</em> from 2016</a>. While both games are open-world space RPGs, the sequel expands on every part of the original game, featuring more planets, weapons, enemies, skills, factions, and features. And like the original, <em>Outer Worlds 2</em> is clearly inspired by Bethesda’s <em>Fallout</em> games and Obsidian’s own <em><a href="https://kotaku.com/review-fallout-new-vegas-5670346">Fallout: New Vegas</a>.</em> The original got close to emulating the experience of playing (and screwing around in) a <em>Fallout</em> RPG, but due to a limited budget and scope, didn’t quite nail it. <a href="https://kotaku.com/outer-worlds-2-rpg-inventory-weight-encumbered-2000650641"><em>The Outer Worlds 2</em></a> does, and it’s wonderful.</p>

 <p>Everything I love about Bethesda’s <em>Fallout</em> games is here. Hand-crafted areas to explore, filled with stretches of empty land, bustling communities, and odd characters and situations to stumble into. <em>The Outer Worlds 2</em> also features an in-depth RPG system with a massive list of perks and skills to level up, letting you build a smooth-talking scam artist, a beefy melee warrior, or a super-smart sniper able to hack any robot. Or you could create a murderous, evil idiot who is super lucky. And the best part is, <a href="https://kotaku.com/fallout-new-vegas-things-never-say-fan-bethesda-xbox-1851467599">like in<em> Fallout 3</em> and <em>New Vegas</em></a>, the world reacts to your choices and offers up ways to use those skills and perks to your advantage.</p>

 <p>I mean, <em>The Outer Worlds 2</em> even includes the ability to turn on an <a href="https://www.restart.run/articles/the-outer-worlds-2-soundtrack-interview">in-game radio and listen to in-world music, DJs, ads, and more</a> as you hike about the various planets, completing quests and discovering new locations. This is a key part of the <em>Fallout</em> formula for me and something I was happy to see included in <em>The</em> <em>Outer Worlds 2</em>. Blowing up random enemies with a laser gun is just more fun when retro music is blaring in the background.</p>

  <p>And unlike Bethesda’s <em>Fallout</em> games,<em> The Outer Worlds 2</em> doesn’t feel like it’s falling apart as you continue to play. It also features much better writing, more interesting companions, better combat, and far fewer bugs. In my many, many hours with <em>The Outer Worlds 2,</em> I only had to reload a save due to a bug once, and only encountered one other really annoying game-breaking glitch. Beyond that, <em>The Outer Worlds 2</em> is a more stable and better-looking spin on the Bethesda RPG formula.</p> <p>If you’re someone who has been craving a new <em>Fallout</em> and doesn’t want to replay <em>Fallout 3</em> o<em>r New Vegas</em> for the 20th time, I’d highly recommend<em> Outer Worlds 2</em>. It’s probably the closest thing to a <em>Fallout 5</em> we’ll be getting from an Xbox-owned studio any time soon, because <a href="https://kotaku.com/fallout-5-v-bethesda-elder-scrolls-6-release-date-starf-1849062025"><em>The Elder Scrolls 6</em> is still likely years away, and the next <em>Fallout</em> will only arrive once Bethesda is done with that</a>. Thankfully, <em>Outer Worlds 2</em> is pretty dang rad and is highly replayable. A good way to kill a few years while you wait for <em>Fallout 5.</em></p>

            <title><![CDATA[First Avengers Doomsday Trailer With Captain America May Have Just Leaked]]></title>
            <link>https://kotaku.com/avengers-doomsday-chris-evans-steve-rogers-captain-america-2000653491</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><span>Steve Rogers was supposed to retire with Peggy after time-traveling to the past at the end of </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/avengers-endgame-rerelease-movie-theater-tickets-doomsday-2000651023"><i><span>Avengers: Endgame</span></i></a><span>, but the Marvel Cinematic Universe has been struggling lately, so the man is </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/chris-evans-avengers-doomsday-mcu-robert-downey-jr-1851717766"><span>back in </span><i><span>Avengers: Doomsday</span></i></a><span>, as if Disney has broken him out of an “in case of emergency” case. According to Hollywood leaker </span><a href="https://x.com/DanielRPK/status/2000541109412364416?s=20"><span>Daniel Richtman</span></a><span>, Marvel is reportedly putting out multiple theater-exclusive teasers featuring some returning characters for the film, and the first will star Chris Evans as the man formerly known as Captain America. From the looks of it, the video may have leaked if you want to get a glimpse into the cozy life of the OG Cap.</span></p> <p><span>The supposed teaser that is now circulating online is not of great quality, but it shows Steve getting off a motorcycle and walking into his home to stare nostalgically at his old suit, and then lovingly at a cute little baby. The video plays a sparse piano version of the official Avengers theme, and then the text “Steve Rogers will return in Avengers Doomsday” shows up on a black screen. Because the quality is so poor, it’s entirely possible this could be an AI fake that someone is passing off as a real tease, but any telltale signs of AI slop are masked by the bad recording. However, some folks are reporting that Marvel is hitting these videos with a DMCA strike, so make of that what you will. The teaser will reportedly make an official debut in theaters ahead of </span><i><span>Avatar: Fire and Ash </span></i><span>later this week.</span></p>

   <p><span>Earlier this morning, directors the Russo Brothers posted a close-up image on their Instagram account of…something…with the hashtag #AvengersDoomsday on it. It might be a close-up from this trailer. If you squint hard enough, it kinda looks like a close-up of a motorcycle wheel. Maybe?</span></p>   <p><span>According to Richtman, more teasers will follow, including ones featuring Chris Hemsworth’s Thor and Robert Downey Jr. as Doctor Doom. A fourth teaser and final teaser will be more “general” and focus on the broader cast.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>It’s not a groundbreaking observation, but Marvel </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/avengers-doomsday-4-cast-announcement-stream-mcu-marvel-1851772474"><span>leaning into the original </span><i><span>Avengers </span></i><span>cast</span></a><span> to tease the next movie, which was once </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/avengers-5-kang-dynasty-name-change-rework-1851275299"><span>supposed to be about a different group of heroes and villains</span></a><span>, is one of the most pathetic, groveling moves the company could be making right now. But it was clear from the moment the company cast Downey Jr. as Doom that </span><i><span>Doomsday </span></i><span>would be an expensive exercise in playing the hits. Why would you bring back a bunch of actors from the </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/avengers-doomsday-x-men-patrick-stewart-ian-mckellen-1851772571"><span>old </span><i><span>X-Men </span></i><span>movies</span></a><span> unless you were banking on nostalgia above all else? Yanking Steve Rogers out of his cozy life is one of the most transparent examples of this. We’ll see how Marvel uses the character when </span><i><span>Doomsday </span></i><span>premieres on </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/avengers-doomsday-secret-wars-delay-gta-6-1851782163"><span>December 18, 2026</span></a><span>.</span></p>

            <title><![CDATA[Bungie’s Marathon Resurfaces With $40 Price Tag And A March 2026 Release Date]]></title>
            <link>https://kotaku.com/marathon-release-date-price-battle-pass-proximity-chat-2000653472</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><em>Marathon</em> was supposed to be out months ago. Instead, its coming in March 2026. <a href="https://kotaku.com/playstation-bungie-marathon-destiny-2-acquisition-fiscal-2000642935">Bungie revealed the new launch timing</a> in a surprise video documentary that went live on Monday in which the game’s developers promise a sci-fi survival extraction shooter that’s full of mysteries and hidden dangers.</p> <p>The fresh 22-minute deep-dive goes over all of the elements of the project the studio’s been rehabbing since it was indefinitely delayed earlier this year following <a href="https://kotaku.com/marathon-alpha-review-impressions-bungie-extraction-fps-1851777775">harsh fan feedback</a> form its initial public alpha test. During that quiet period, Bungie’s held multiple closed beta tests to re-examine gameplay and introduced completely new features, including proximity chat. After becoming a cornerstone of this fall’s hit rival extraction shooter, <a href="https://kotaku.com/arc-raiders-review-extraction-loot-shooter-embark-2000642198"><em>Arc Raiders</em></a>, the feature will now be a staple of <em>Marathon</em> as well.</p>

  <p>The <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjzmhROTv28">documentary also details</a> the development team’s evolving approach to everything from audio and visuals to zone design and loot mechanics. The goal is clear: make <em>Marathon</em>‘s maps and the experiences that take place there have more of an identity beyond repetitive beats within a grindy, quick-match PVP shooter. “We’ve brought a little bit of grounded-ness, a little bit of grit, a little bit of darkness, a little bit of that mood, that kind of is necessary for an extraction shooter to feel dangerous,” said producer Emanuel Rosu.</p>

 <p>The video goes on to address a bunch of other complaints players had from the original public alpha test. That includes prioritizing solo play options, improving the visuals, and even making it so that opponent runners leave corpses behind that decay instead of just having their dropped loot appear as static back packs. There will be four maps at launch, including an end-game area onboard UESC Marathon.</p>

 <p>In addition to upgrade trees, faction ranks, and unlockable rewards, Bungie is also promising some level of gun customization to change how weapons play, letting players invent iconic gear from the studio’s past by doing things like changing an SMG into Halo’s Needler.</p>

 <h2><em>Marathon</em> won’t be free-to-play</h2> <p><a href="https://www.bungie.net/7/en/News/Article/marathonvidoc">In a blog post</a>, Bungie outlined what the game’s approach to monetization will be, including battle passes that don’t expire and no pay-to-win mechanics:</p> <blockquote><p>Purchasing <em>Marathon</em> will give you full access to the game, including a roadmap of free gameplay updates as the year progresses. This will include new maps, new Runner shells, events, and more, starting with the exploration of UESC Marathon’s Cryo Archive in Season 1.</p> <p>We also want to ensure you are logging in because you love the game, not from fear of missing out—so Marathon’s Rewards Passes will not expire, and you’ll be able to purchase and unlock prior Passes.</p> <p>Finally, and most importantly, we believe in preserving competitive integrity in Marathon, so survival will never come down to how much money you spend.</p></blockquote> <p>This is essentially the <em>Helldivers 2</em> playbook, which served that smash-hit live service game well. As a PVEVP game, however, <em>Marathon</em> will face the additional challenge of balancing other hostile players with its bespoke world-building. We’ll see how that works in practice in just a few months.</p>
