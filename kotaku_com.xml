            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Dell laptops typically sit in the premium tier where you’re paying extra for build quality and brand reputation. But every once in a while, the pricing gods smile upon us and something wild happens. Right now, you can grab a fully loaded <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5000/">Dell Inspiron with Windows 11 Pro, a massive 2TB SSD, and 64GB of RAM for just $959, down from its usual $3,699 price tag</a>. That’s a $2,740 discount which makes this the<strong> steepest markdown on any Windows 11 Pro laptop currently available on Amazon</strong>.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5000/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<p>The configuration here is impressive for anyone who needs serious computing power without compromise: That 64GB of RAM is overkill for casual browsing, sure, but if you’re running virtual machines, editing 4K video footage, juggling dozens of browser tabs while running Adobe Creative Suite, or compiling code, this amount of memory transforms your workflow. You can <strong>keep everything open simultaneously without that dreaded slowdown</strong> when your system starts swapping to disk. The 2TB solid-state drive gives you enough room to store your entire photo library and still have breathing room left over.</p>
<h2>Professional Power That Doesn’t Break the Budget</h2>
<p>The Ryzen 7 7730U processor found in this laptop is an <strong>AMD Zen 3 processor with a boost speed of 4.5 GHz</strong> if the need arises for more power. With eight cores and sixteen threads, it is a multitasking beast with enough power for content generation and even some gaming in between tasks if the need arises. The Ryzen 7 7730U is optimized for performance with power savings in mind, so if your need for it is something that doesn’t require it to be plugged in for extended periods, then it is possible to use it for an extended period without checking the percentage meter like it is a ticking time bomb.</p>



<p>The <strong>15.6-inch touchscreen display has Full HD capabilities with 1920×1080 pixels</strong>, and provides sharp text rendering and picture quality minus the power consumption associated with high-resolution screens. The <em>Wide Viewing Angle</em> feature ensures that the displayed color remains accurate even if the screen is being viewed from an angle, particularly useful during presentation setups where multiple viewers congregate around the screen, making it easier for others to view what is being showcased on the screen. Having an <strong>anti-glare screen</strong> is indeed a welcome feature if your work environment is near a window or under bright office lighting, where it becomes possible to view the screen without the botheration posed by overwhelming reflections.</p>



<p>Windows 11 Pro is an improvement over the last edition in terms of the benefits it offers for professional usage. You enjoy <em>BitLocker</em>-protected storage for secure storage of your files, the ability to connect to other computers using Remote Desktop, allowing access from any location, and joining a domain if you’re connecting from your company’s network. With the “Pro” version Off Windows 11, you have more flexibility with Windows Update so you can delay feature updates so that it doesn’t restart in the middle of a critical operation.</p>
<p>Dell also bundles a comprehensive accessory package with its laptop which actually provides value addition rather than mere inflation in the box. You can expect to get a <strong>stylus pen for operating the touchscreen display, a camera privacy cover for those concerned with security, a 128GB USB storage drive for transferring files quickly, dust plugs for protecting the ports, a laptop sleeve, and even a microfiber cloth</strong> for cleaning the system.</p>
<p>At $959, it’s an historic low for a laptop with such specs coupled with the Windows 11 Pro license.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Amazon Is Offloading This 60,000mAh Power Bank for Pennies, Anker’s Stock Is Flying off the Shelves]]></title>
            <link>https://kotaku.com/amazon-is-offloading-this-60000mah-power-bank-for-pennies-ankers-stock-is-flying-off-the-shelves-2000638972</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/amazon-is-offloading-this-60-000mah-power-bank-for-pennies-anker%E2%80%99s-stock-is-flying-off-the-shelves.1334593/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>The little 10,000mAh power banks you see everywhere are fine for topping up your phone once, maybe twice if you’re lucky. But when you’re camping for the weekend, dealing with a power outage or spending a full day at an outdoor event, that tiny capacity just doesn’t cut it. You need serious juice, and that’s exactly what the Anker <em>PowerCore</em> delivers. Right now, Amazon <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4144/">has slashed this beast of a power bank from $149 down to just $79</a>, which is an all-time low for a device packing a <strong>massive 60,000mAh capacity</strong>.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4144/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<p>The 60,000mAh capacity translates to <strong>192 watt-hours of stored energy</strong> which means you can charge an iPhone 17 more than 10 times over or keep a 3-watt LED lamp running for over 42 hours straight. That’s the difference between fumbling in the dark during a blackout and having reliable lighting for nearly two full days. The <strong>dual USB-C ports deliver 60 watts and 27 watts respectively</strong> so you can fast-charge a laptop and a smartphone at the same time without sacrificing speed.</p>
<h2>A Backup Generator That Fits in Your Backpack</h2>
<p>Anker built this power station with emergencies in mind and it’s apparent in its design. There’s a built-in light on top of the power station that’s retractable; it’s incredibly bright which makes it perfect for nighttime campsite setups or traveling during power outages. Still, the feature that stands out in terms of safety is its dedicated SOS button for an emergency strobe light function. The intelligent display screen on the front lets users know exactly what their power levels, wattage output, and time left are, so they’re never surprised by a power level status they can’t gauge on their own in the absence of wall power access.</p>



<p>The solar panel compatibility is what elevates it from a mere power bank to a off-grid system on its own: You can hook up a compatible solar panel via the input socket to charge it using only sunlight which is fantastic for long camping ventures or readiness systems for power outages. Charging the system is quite easy; simply hook up the USB-C to USB-C charging cord to a wall socket so it only takes 5-6 hours using your wall socket’s wattage, which is quite acceptable for such massive capacity.</p>



<p>As for the build quality, it’s definitely robust without being completely bulky either. Of course, it’s a bit heavier, thanks to the presence of battery cells but it is something that can be easily thrown into a backpack or even into an auto-emergency kit in your car, if need be. The build quality appears to be more resilient to rough handling, which is quite an aspect if one is supposed to be using it outdoors, say in an RV during an adventure vacation. Anker warrants it with a three-year warranty, which is an assurance on their own part regarding its durability.</p>
<p>At $79, <strong>this deal represents a 47 percent discount</strong> and brings the price per watt-hour down to an incredibly competitive level. Most portable power stations in this capacity range still hover around $120 to $200 so catching this at under $80 is fantastic.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/halo-1-remake-combat-evolved-trailer-hwc-teaser-xbox-ps5-2000638911">The newly revealed </a><em>Halo: Campaign Evolved,</em> an Unreal Engine 5 remake of 2001’s <em>Halo</em>, isn’t just a graphical update of the original game. The devs are making some big changes to the classic <em>Halo</em> experience, and this includes changing levels. And yes, if you were wondering, The Library is one of the levels getting tweaked.</p> <p>Ask 100 random <em>Halo</em> fans what the worst level in the first game is, and 90 or more will likely say “The Library.” This late-in-story level is very long, filled with never-ending waves of Flood, aka space zombies, and has limited supplies, checkpoints, and waypoints. It also lacks visual variety and can be a dull experience on lower difficulties and a pain in the ass for those playing on higher difficulties who enter unprepared. To help players in 2025, Halo Studios is making some changes to <em>Halo’s</em> infamously annoying level.</p>

 <p><a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2025/10/24/halo-campaign-evolved-answering-the-big-questions/">In an October 24 blog post</a>, Halo Studios and Xbox explained that with Library, “it felt right to make tweaks to several areas” to create a “new experience that balances nostalgia with the expectations of today’s gamers.”</p>

 <p>“We learned from&nbsp;<em>Halo: Combat Evolved Anniversary</em> that there was still an appetite for things like better wayfinding, navigation, and diversity in enemy encounters,” said <em>Halo </em>creative director Matt Szlagor. “In The Library specifically, which features several Flood encounters, we wanted to reevaluate the pacing and enhance the environmental storytelling. We’ve added new lines to Guilty Spark, which guide players through the level, and there’s new dialogue that gives more insight into the narrative as it plays out.”</p>

 <p>He further added: &nbsp;“We’re not changing the stories, it’s about refining and adding context to this moment, and other levels like it, so players can stay on track.”</p> <p><a href="https://www.rollingstone.com/culture/rs-gaming/halo-campaign-evolved-remake-impressions-1235451111/">Speaking to <em>Rolling Stone</em>,</a> executive producer Damon Conn claimed that every mission, encounter, and cinematic in <em>Halo: Combat Evolved</em> has been “rebuilt and retouched with the spirit intact of the original’s awe, sense of discovery, and heroism.” Hopefully, that means the Library won’t look like the same boring grey corridors over and over again for 20 minutes.</p> <p><em>Halo: Campaign Evolved</em> launches on PS5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC in 2026.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/halo-remake-campaign-evolved-playstation-cross-play-2000638951</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/microsoft-confirms-halo-will-be-on-playstation-%E2%80%98going-forward%E2%80%99.1334506/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Today, Microsoft and Halo Studios announced they’re remaking the original&nbsp;<em>Halo&nbsp;</em>again as&nbsp;<a href="https://kotaku.com/halo-1-remake-combat-evolved-trailer-hwc-teaser-xbox-ps5-2000638911"><em>Halo: Campaign Evolved</em></a>. The remake is sprucing up the shooter’s campaign, adding three new prequel levels, and will support up to four-player cooperative runs. The biggest news out of the announcement, however, is that the game is also coming to PlayStation 5, and it sounds like Master Chief’s adventures will also be coming to PlayStation for the foreseeable future.</p> <p>This was confirmed on a livestream from the Halo World Championship after the remake’s announcement. Halo Studios community director Brian “ske7ch” Jarrard said that&nbsp;<em>Halo&nbsp;</em>is a multiplatform series “going forward.” The remake supports crossplay between platforms, so if you want to get your old co-op buddies together after 25 years, you can do that no matter what system they’re playing on. And it sounds like that will be the case with future games, as well.</p>

 <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">Confirmed: Halo will be on PlayStation "going forward" starting with the Combat Evolved remake. <a href="https://t.co/y23v1B3mfV">pic.twitter.com/y23v1B3mfV</a></p> <p>— AmericanTruckSongs9 (@ethangach) <a href="https://twitter.com/ethangach/status/1981827679667290555?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 24, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <p>In a post on the <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/10/24/halo-campaign-evolved-launches-on-ps5-in-2026/">PlayStation Blog</a>, Jarrad teased that Halo Studios may have more&nbsp;<em>Halo&nbsp;</em>announcements for PlayStation 5 owners in the future, saying, “As the Master Chief once said: ‘I think we’re just getting started.'” If the series is coming to a new audience this many entries in, I wouldn’t be surprised if we also see the <em>Master Chief Collection&nbsp;</em>on PlayStation in the coming years. The compilation includes all the&nbsp;<em>Halo&nbsp;</em>games up to&nbsp;<em>5: Guardians</em>, including the spin-offs&nbsp;<em>Reach&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>3: ODST</em>, which don’t follow Master Chief but instead tell separate stories in Bungie and Halo Studios’ sci-fi universe. This would also be as good a time as any to bring <em>Guardians</em> and&nbsp;<em>Infinite</em>, the two most recent games in the series which aren’t included in the collection, to PlayStation 5 as well.</p> <p>All of this comes after <a href="https://kotaku.com/xbox-microsoft-price-hike-game-pass-layoffs-new-console-2000638546">reports of Microsoft enforcing new profit goals</a> on its Xbox division, seemingly resulting in a complete rethinking of the gaming brand’s direction.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/halo-1-remake-combat-evolved-trailer-hwc-teaser-xbox-ps5-2000638911</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/halo-combat-evolved-remake-leaks-includes-new-weapons-4-player-co-op-and-more.1334446/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>During the first day of Xbox’s big <em>Halo</em> esports event, a previously rumored remake of the original <em>Halo: Combat Evolved </em>leaked ahead of a reported announcement. And surprise, surprise, after over two decades of being an Xbox-only series, <em>Halo</em> is making the leap to PlayStation in 2026.</p>   <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/halo-6-infinite-unreal-engine-ue5-ce-remake-343-1851666611">This new remake, officially titled <em>Halo: Campaign Evolved, </em>was previously teased at last year’s HWCS via a tech demo</a> that looked to contain remade assets from <em>Halo CE</em>.&nbsp; There have also been <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MBaqo2AZxRY">multiple reports</a> of this newly announced remake of the very first <em>Halo</em> game, which is the first new game from Halo Studios since 2021’s<em> Halo Infinite</em>. Despite positive reviews, the open-world spin on <em>Halo</em> failed to achieve the long-term success that Xbox had hoped for. Two years later, the studio suffered layoffs in 2023 and was then completely rebranded in 2024. The studio has also ditched<em> Halo Infinite’</em>s custom-made engine, Slipstream, and is now using Unreal Engine 5.</p>

 <h2>Here’s What The New <em>Halo</em> Remake Looks Like In Action</h2> <p><em>Halo: Campaign Evolved</em> is a totally different game from the <em>Halo: Combat Evolved</em> remaster we got back on the Xbox 360. As seen in this extended gameplay trailer, which Xbox published shortly after the store page went live, this is a brand new game based on the OG title with incredible visuals and new features. <a href="https://www.rollingstone.com/culture/rs-gaming/halo-campaign-evolved-remake-impressions-1235451111/#:~:text=It%E2%80%99s%20also%20just%20the%20campaign%3B%20there%E2%80%99s%20no%20multiplayer%20mode%2C%20which%20will%20ruffle%20some%20feathers.%20Previously">According to a preview from <em>Rolling Stone</em></a>, <em>Campaign Evolved</em> doesn’t feature any competitive multiplayer modes. It will support two-player split screen and four-player online co-op, though.</p>

  <p>In the gameplay video above, we see someone playing through one of the game’s best levels, The Silent Cartographer. And at the end of that 13-minute gameplay trailer, it’s confirmed this upcoming remake of the classic FPS is coming to PlayStation 5 as well as Game Pass, Xbox Series X/S, PC, and Xbox Cloud. What a world we live in. <a href="https://kotaku.com/xbox-gears-of-war-ps5-remake-remaster-halo-forza-port-1851779186"><em>Forza, Gears of War, </em>and now <em>Halo</em> are all PlayStation games. Wild.</a> The game will support both crossplay and cross progression across all platforms.</p>

 <p>According to Microsoft, as confirmed in a livestream during the <em>Halo</em> esports event, <a href="https://x.com/ethangach/status/1981827679667290555">“going forward,” <em>Halo</em> will be on PlayStation</a>. This seems to indicate that all future <em>Halo</em> games (and maybe past games) will ship on both Xbox and PlayStation. And Halo Studios teased this further, quoting the Master Chief in a post about the new remake: &nbsp;“<a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/10/24/halo-campaign-evolved-launches-on-ps5-in-2026/#:~:text=As%20the%20Master%20Chief%20once%20said%3A%20%E2%80%9CI%20think%20we%E2%80%99re%20just%20getting%20started.%E2%80%9D">I think we’re just getting started.”</a></p>

 <h2>The New Stuff Being Added To <em>Halo: Campaign Evolved</em></h2> <p>In a PlayStation Blog post from <em>Halo</em> community director Brian “ske7ch” Jarrard, he welcomed PS5 gamers to the <em>Halo</em> universe and outlined some of the new content being added to this remade version of the 2001 classic. This remake features improved combat and nine new weapons, with some pulled from other <em>Halo</em> games. It also includes “three brand-new prequel missions starring the Master Chief and Sgt. Johnson.” According to both the PlayStation post and Xbox store listing, these missions are “set before the events of <em>Halo: Combat Evolved” </em>and will add “new environments, gameplay, and characters” to the remake.</p>

 <p>Players will be able to hijack vehicles, a feature introduced in <em>Halo 2</em>, in this new remake. This means you can even hijack the powerful Wraith tanks and drive them around, something that wasn’t possible in the first <em>Halo</em>. This new version of <em>Halo</em> also contains the largest number of “Skulls” in the franchise’s history, letting players remix missions with various effects, like, yes, the Grunt Birthday Party skull. Oh, and you can sprint now in the remake, though Halo Studios confirms that the feature can be disabled.</p> <p><a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2025/10/24/halo-campaign-evolved-answering-the-big-questions/">In an Xbox blog post</a>, it was confirmed that <em>Halo: Campaign Evolved</em> is running on Unreal Engine 5 and will support 4K visuals and include updated animations, remastered music, and re-recorded voice lines. “The campaign has been rebuilt to feel handcrafted and immersive, true to what players remember, not just visually, but emotionally,” explained the game’s executive producer, Damon Conn.</p> <p><em>Halo: Campaign Evolved</em> is set to launch in 2026 on Xbox, PS5, and PC.</p>
