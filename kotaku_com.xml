That episode will be the last gasp of an ambitious sci-fi universe the developers at Firewalk Studios helped to jumpstart this year. Unfortunately, the game itself ended up being an unprecedented flop, and Sony shut down the studio just last month. </p><p> “I don’t feel bad that it’s a part of the show, because I think it’s an episode that turned out really well, and you can kind of see the potential of this world and the characters,” Tim Miller, the lead creative behind<em> Secret Level</em>, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.rollingstone.com/culture/rs-gaming/tim-miller-secret-level-prime-video-1235161263/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.rollingstone.com/culture/rs-gaming/tim-miller-secret-level-prime-video-1235161263/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">told <em>Rolling Stone</em></a></span> this week. “If it’s the remaining vestige of that product, I hope the developers feel that it’s in some way worthy, just a little bit, of the blood, sweat, and tears they put into it.” </p><p>He added that he personally has no idea why <em>Concord</em> failed the way it did. “There was no nicer, more invested group of developers than the team on <em>Concord</em>,” Miller said. “I honestly don’t understand why it didn’t work. I know that they were trying to do the best they could, and they were a talented group of artists, so I feel terrible for that.”</p><p><em>Secret Level</em> premieres on Amazon’s streaming service on December 10 with new episodes dropping throughout that week. That might be when players finally catch a better glimpse of what <em>Concord</em>’s developers hoped would make it so special. </p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

It seems it’s more that the company is worried they’ll play with it the wrong way. “By the time you notice, it’s already covered in drool...”</p><p>I have three cats, and I can’t say this has ever proved an issue. My ten-year-old is far more likely to cover the screen in that inexplicable sticky residue all children exude, even more so than Archie, the giant, lumbering ginger. Although, in fairness, I don’t own a slavering St. Bernard or Mastiff, leaving those ghastly tendrils of slobber everywhere they go. I wouldn’t want one of those playing <em>Zelda</em> on my device.</p><p>The tweet continues, “Pet saliva and urine can cause the device to malfunction due to water exposure. If you have pets, be careful about where you place your Switch.”</p><p>“Pets” seems to be doing rather a lot of work, trying to cover up for the real culprits here: <em>dogs</em>. Just name them, Nintendo. Stop trying to be all woke and refusing to profile. We’ve also got a pet corn snake, and I’m not in the least concerned about Cornflake running my Switch under the faucet.</p><p>However, according to the image accompanying the warning, it looks like Nintendo might be more concerned about rabid foxes than anything else.</p><p>Look, it’s good advice. You <em>should</em> stop your pets from peeing on your electronic devices. You also shouldn’t put them through the washing machine, run them over with your car, or drop them into a volcano.</p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
