            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Earlier today, Nintendo revealed a lot about the upcoming<a href="https://kotaku.com/tomodachi-life-living-the-dream-direct-nintendo-2000664120"><em> Tomodachi Life: Living the Dream.</em></a> The cute life-sim sequel is set to arrive in April on Switch and Switch 2. But when it arrives, be prepared to take photos of your screen using your phone if you want to share anything online, as Nintendo is locking down screenshot sharing in the game.</p> <p>On January 29, shortly after posting a new Nintendo Direct all about <em>Tomodachi Life: Living the Dream</em>, people noticed new information about the upcoming game on the company’s official support site. Specifically, as shared by deals guru Wario64 on social media, people discovered that the life-sim sequel, which lets you create characters and get them into wild situations involving other NPCs, will make it difficult to easily share screenshots of all the silliness online on both Switch and Switch 2.</p>

 <p><a href="https://en-americas-support.nintendo.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/71317/">In a post on its support page for the game,</a> Nintendo says <em>Tomodachi Life</em> offers plenty of “freedom” that can sometimes lead to “unpredictable moments.” And that’s a problem.</p> <p>“While these moments are often fun for players, we recognize that out-of-context scenes may be misunderstood or may not reflect the spirit in which the game is intended to be enjoyed,” said Nintendo. “Nintendo is committed to creating experiences that are welcoming and enjoyable for everyone. To support this commitment, and in consideration of the unique gameplay in&nbsp;<em>Tomodachi Life: Living the Dream</em>, we have decided to place restrictions on certain image-sharing features.”</p>

 <h2>Which image-sharing features are blocked in <em>Tomodachi Life: Living the Dream</em></h2> <p>While support page doesn’t go into specific detail about what these restrictions are, <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/jp/switch/blfga/index.html?modal=1">but if you visit the official Japanese website for the game</a>, you can find this notice:</p> <blockquote><p><span dir="auto">The console’s functions for transferring images to smartphones, posting directly to social media, and </span><span dir="auto">automatically uploading images (Nintendo Switch 2 only) will not be available.</span></p></blockquote> <p>The notice does confirm that Switch 2 players will still be able to use Game Chat to share gameplay of<em> Tomodachi Life: Living the Dream.</em> Still, it is annoying that Nintendo is placing such restrictions on the game, especially when you consider that anyone can just grab their phone and take a screenshot of the game and post it. Which people are going to do. So this won’t really stop people from sharing silly images of characters kissing or whatever Nintendo is afraid is going to happen in April.</p>

 <p>It should also be noted that Nintendo is, at least from what we can tell, not blocking screenshots entirely, just the ability to share them easily online with others.</p> <p>“We understand that some players may find these restrictions limiting,” said Nintendo on its support page. “However, they reflect Nintendo’s ongoing philosophy of creating experiences that bring smiles to everyone who plays.”</p> <p>Some reacted to this news by suggesting that this is likely Nintendo trying to avoid another “Swapnote incident,” but that seems like a very different situation that involved people directly messaging young kids for nefarious reasons using Nintendo software. Taking a screenshot of something silly or weird in your game and then instantly sharing it online using a console’s built-in screenshot button and sharing options is such a great feature in most modern consoles. Nintendo trying to make that harder is odd and also ignores that, once again, everyone has phones and will share whatever they want online. I also can’t help but notice this is happening with the <a href="https://kotaku.com/tomodachi-life-gay-nonbinary-nintendo-switch-2000664147">first Nintendo game to officially feature gay and non-binary Miis. Hmm…</a></p>

 <p><em>Tomodachi Life: Living the Dream</em> arrives on Switch and Switch 2 on April 16. Don’t you dare share a screenshot of something weird happening, or a Nintendo lawyer will get you.</p>

              <p>A smattering of classic<em> Final Fantasy</em> games are now available to buy and play via Good Old Games. It’s the first time any games from Square Enix’s popular RPG franchise have been made available on GOG, and to celebrate, the newly added titles are currently on sale.</p> <p>On January 29, <a href="https://www.gog.com/en/news/four_iconic_final_fantasy_titles_are_here">GOG announced</a> that <a href="https://www.gog.com/en/promo/final_fantasy">four <em>Final Fantasy</em> games were now available on the PC gaming storefront</a>. If you were expecting the first four entries into the series to be the first ones to arrive on GOG, you’ll be in for a surprise when you look below to check out the list of FF games added today.</p>

 <ul> <li><em>Final Fantasy III (3D Remake)</em> – $6.40 ($16)</li> <li><em>Final Fantasy IV (3D Remake)</em> – $6.40 ($16)</li> <li><em>Final Fantasy VIII – Remastered</em> – $8 ($20)</li> <li><em>Final Fantasy IX </em>– $8.40 ($21)</li> </ul> <p>GOG says these entries “represent different eras of the series” which might help explain the scattershot release. But I guess you gotta start somewhere? All four <em>Final Fantasy</em> RPGs on GOG are also part of the store’s fantastic <a href="https://kotaku.com/gog-games-preservation-program-drm-1851696363">Good Old Game preservation program</a>, ensuring they will work on modern PCs for years to come, even if Square Enix removes them from sale or doesn’t want to update them in the future, <a href="https://kotaku.com/gog-warcraft-1-2-classic-remaster-drm-preservation-1851711097">something that has happened before</a>.</p> <p>“Few video game series have shaped the medium quite like <em>Final Fantasy,”</em> said GOG in a news post on Thursday. “For decades, it has defined storytelling in games, pushed technical and artistic boundaries, and created worlds and characters that resonate far beyond the screen. Today, we’re proud to announce that four landmark entries in the franchise are coming to GOG!”</p>

 <p>All four <em>Final Fantasy</em> games are available now. I expect more will be added in the future. <a href="https://kotaku.com/gog-caught-using-ai-generated-artwork-2000663836">Now, go tell GOG to stop using gross AI art for banners</a>.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/ecoflow-goes-all-in-on-portable-power-station-clearance-river-2-pro-generator-drops-40-with-a-5-year-warranty-2000663939</link>

              <p>Investing in a power station can be a smart decision if you’re often out and about or want to have a backup option during outages. The best options out there offer multiple ports and a reliable battery life, but they often don’t come cheap. That, however, is changing today.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6489/">Right now, you can snag the EF Ecoflow River 2 Pro portable power station for just $315 at Amazon, after the retailer knocked 40% off its usual $529 price tag.</a> The offer is open to all shoppers, but it ends soon. Grab yours now, before Amazon decides to shoot the price back up (which can be any moment now).</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6489/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Multiple Ports for a Wide Range of Devices</h2>
<p>The River 2 Pro weighs just 17.2 lbs and features a built-in handle, both of which make it easy to carry the power station around. You’re getting a total of 11 ports, including four AC outlets, one USB-C port, three USB-A ports, two DC outlets, and one car outlet. That’s more than enough to keep all your important devices powered in cases of emergency. Think plugging your smartphone, laptop, an electric blanket, a coffee machine, and lights – all at the same time, without feeling limited.</p>
<p>The output of up to 1600W makes the thing perfectly capable of running around 80% off all your appliances, even high-wattage ones. It can recharge your phone from 0 to 100% 57 times on a single charge, and your laptop for over 10. When at home, it keeps your electric blanket powered for 12 hours, your refrigerator for five, and even your PC for over an hour. That means you can rely on it to get work done during an unexpected outage, plus keep other essentials running for extended periods.</p>



<p>When it comes to recharging the power bank itself, that doesn’t take forever either. You can power it back up via an AC outlet, a solar panel, a Type-C cable, or your car. Using an AC outlet is the fastest option, juicing it back to 100% in just 70 minutes. A 220w solar panel will take around 3.5 hours, while plugging it into a 12v/24v 8A car outlet gets the job done in about nine hours. This flexibility comes in handy when you’re camping in the wild, traveling, or dealing with electricity supply issues at home. Additionally, the LFP battery cells are long-lasting, letting you recharge the River 2 Pro more than 3000 times before dropping to 80% capacity. For reference, that’s nearly 10 years of regular use. What’s more, the power station includes advanced BMS protection that monitors voltage, current, and temperature to ensure longevity. Basically, it’s made to support all your power needs for years to come.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6489/">Included in the box are the power station itself, an AC charging cable, a user manual, and a 5-year service for added peace of mind</a>. Altogether, the EcoFlow River 2 Pro portable power station is great for anyone looking to invest in a reliable power solution without putting a dent in their wallet. This deal makes the upgrade easier than ever. Just make sure you grab the offer before it’s too late.</p>
