The free post-launch patch will include even more powerful monsters for players to hunt, a relief following pre-release worries that the game might be the easiest <em>Monster Hunter</em> yet. </p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="196742" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="What Is Dragonsplague?

TU1 will bring with it a monster of formidable strength at a level above Tempered!” Capcom <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://steamcommunity.com/games/2246340/announcements/detail/534343407476147236&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://steamcommunity.com/games/2246340/announcements/detail/534343407476147236" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">revealed</a></span> on Thursday. <br>“Another challenging monster will also await you!” The leviathan Mizutsune was previously teased as one of the first post-launch beats coming to the game. The publisher also confirmed a social hub for players to meet, communicate, and eat with one another will be added in April and available to players who have completed the game’s main story.</p><p>That’s welcome news considering that there’s currently no place to hang out with other hunters and show off cool armor and gear. The news of stronger bosses on the way is also great, considering <em>Monster Hunter Wilds’ </em>main story can be a cake walk and even some of the post-game content doesn’t feel too difficult if you’re correctly prepared or rolling with a full squad of other players (or AI-controlled NPCs). </p><p>A number of early reviews of the game dinged it for how streamlined it feels compared to past entries in the action-RPG series, with some critics and longtime fans especially concerned about the lack of really challenging content even in high-rank missions. That said, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/monster-hunter-wilds-review-ps5-open-world-rpg-capcom-1851766113&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/monster-hunter-wilds-review-ps5-open-world-rpg-capcom-1851766113">as I wrote in my review earlier this week</a></span>, I’ve still been having a blast with <em>Monster Hunter Wilds</em> and there’s clearly plenty of room for more challenging content to arrive in the future. Plus series veterans have been through the <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/MHWilds/comments/1iy9pnh/once_again_the_cycle_repeats_itself/?utm_source=embedv2&amp;utm_medium=post_embed&amp;utm_content=post_title&amp;embed_host_url=https://kinja.com/embed/inset/iframe&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/MHWilds/comments/1iy9pnh/once_again_the_cycle_repeats_itself/?utm_source=embedv2&amp;utm_medium=post_embed&amp;utm_content=post_title&amp;embed_host_url=https://kinja.com/embed/inset/iframe" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">same difficulty debate plenty of times before</a></span>. </p><p>I’m still cleaning up the last of the side quests in the base game and have found myself occasionally getting demolished by a particularly challenging foe like a Tempered Jin Dahaad (it was also late at night and I was starting to fall asleep, which might have been a part of it). And even when <em>Monster Hunter Wilds</em> isn’t making me sweat, every moment has still been a joy. </p><p>It’s a pretty frictionless experience so far, yes, but also still an incredibly robust, refined, and meaty version of the <em>Monster Hunter </em>experience. It’s easy to see it only getting better with time. A month after launch for the first new bosses might be a long wait for some, but it gives the average player plenty of time to get through everything <em>Monster Hunter Wilds</em> currently has to show them, which is a lot. </p><p>.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>February 2025's Steam Next Fest  is upon us, which means there are once again hundreds of free demos to checkout for all different kinds of upcoming PC games. The hail from all different genres and teams, and range from very good to absolutely terrible. Steam is normally a mess to browse, and Next Fest is the usual discoverability labyrinth on steroids. So we’ve been playing stuff to see what has that special spark. Here are some of the games we’ve been enjoying and mesmerized by from Steam’s latest free demo bonanza. </p></div><div><p>Kathy Rain is finally back, eight years after her last, fantastic adventure. She’s now working full-time as a PI, but it’s not going well, money is about to run out, and she’s betting everything on solving a series of local murders by a serial killer called The Soothsayer. The demo gives a good chunk of game, and some excellent puzzles. — John Walker </p><p><strong>Release: </strong>TBA</p></div><div><p>If you thought Steamboat Willie’s entering the public domain was just going to secure you a few terrible horror movies, think again. It’s also going to score one of the most astonishingly disturbing games I’ve ever played. And I’m pretty sure it’s good? <em>Bad Cheese</em>’s demo is a monstrously upsetting first-person...something, in which you play a bloated, morbidly obese Mickey Mouse, desperately trying to find pills for his mutant dog-like father-creature. Oh god, even the sound effects make me curl up to remember. — John Walker</p><p><strong>Release: </strong>TBA</p></div><div><p>This twin-stick shooter does more interesting things in its demo than so many games offer in their entirety. It’s a game where your health bars are also your ammo, so attacking makes you vulnerable, and that’s a damned fine idea alone. Then it gets more complicated. — John Walker</p><p><strong>Release:</strong> TBA</p></div><div><p><em>Bad Cheese</em> isn’t the only disturbing black-and-white demo we’ve found this Next Fest. <em>Kiddo</em> is a monochrome point-and-click adventure in which you play a masked figure who lives in disgusting solitude, finally spurred to leave his couch by the disappearance of his dog. In the demo, you’re mostly focused on trying to clean the toilet. And it’s <em>so</em> good. — John Walker</p><p><strong>Release: </strong>TBA</p></div><div><p>Race around collecting golden gears and other stuff in a beautiful seaside world where you surf around with the flare and ease of an animated ‘90s cereal mascot. <em>Demon Tides</em> is a follow-up to<em> Demon Turf: Neon Splash</em>. There are only about five short levels in the demo so it’s only a taste, but I already want more. I’m cuckoo for Cocoa Puffs, I mean <em>Demon Tides</em>.  — Ethan Gach</p><p><strong>Release: </strong>TBD 2025</p></div><div><p>Set in Quito, Ecuador in 2001, <em>Despelote</em> is an urban walking sim where you learn about a neighborhood and its residents by kicking a soccer ball around. Its collage art-style is evocative, the music is beautiful, and the dream-like exploration of someone else’s mundane memories is affecting and hard to shake. — Ethan Gach</p><p><strong>Release: </strong>May 1, 2025</p></div><div><p>Colorful, fast-paced parkour in a whimsical world that’s constantly falling apart around you. That’s <em>Haste: Broken Worlds</em> in a nutshell, a very neat action platformer that can feel like a mashup of <em>Sonic</em> and a Studio Ghibli movie. I love it. One YouTube comment put it best. “They <em>actually</em> made the ‘Awesome Parkour Guy You Watched Out The Back Seat Car Window When You Were a Kid’ game.” — Ethan Gach</p><p><strong>Release: </strong>TBD</p></div><div><p><em>Mashina </em>is a stop-motion strategy sim where you play a robot digging through the earth to harvest resources and repair the world around you using machines. Think stripped-down elements of <em>Minecraft</em> and<em> Factorio</em> wrapped around a cute, child-like adventure. The demo is super short and gave me <em>ToeJam &amp; Earl</em> vibes (complimentary), and the mixed-media visual style is top-notch.  — Ethan Gach</p><p><strong>Release: </strong>TBD 2025</p></div><div><p><em>Is This Seat Taken</em> is the perfect kind of puzzle game. It has a simple setup—sort out differently-shaped people correctly—and so excellently and confidently nails that premise that playing it feels like someone injecting dopamine directly into your brain. I burned through the demo so fast that I was sad I have to now wait to play the full game. — Zack Zwiezen</p><p><strong>Release:</strong> TBA</p></div><div><p>The latest game from <em>XCOM </em>creator Julian Gollop isn’t what you might expect. <em>Chip ‘n Clawz vs. The Brainioids</em> is a third-person shooter tower defense strategy game that features colorful visuals and large open maps to explore. It’s like someone mixed together<em> Ratchet and Clank</em> with <em>Orcs Must Die</em> and added a tactical vision mode, too. Sounds a bit odd, but it’s really fun and feels great even in this unfinished state. — Zack Zwiezen</p><p><strong>Release:</strong> TBA</p></div><div><p><em>TMNT: Tactical Takedown</em> is pitched as a turn-based beat’em up and while that sounded strange, after playing the new demo, I’m totally in. This new <em>TMNT </em>game is turn-based, sure, but moves fast thanks to the fact that every few turns part of the map falls away. So you are forced to keep moving through crowds of enemies and use each turtle’s unique abilities to fight while picking up pizza for health. It’s a little harder than I expected, but I think this is something special. — Zack Zwiezen</p><p><strong>Release: </strong>TBA</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Sadly, her character’s name is yet to be revealed. </p><p>My <em>Shrek</em> lore is a little rusty, but I believe Shrek<em> </em>had three kids in <em>Forever After</em>—released in 2010. So what happened to the other two? Will they be voiced by equally famous young actors? Or was there a terrible swamp accident and Zendaya’s character is the sole survivor all these years later? Truly, I can’t wait to find out. </p><p>This is the first <em>Shrek</em> movie since 2010's <em>Shrek Forever After</em> and it will arrive just over 25 years after the first movie, which launched the mega successful franchise back in 2001. </p><p>And because it’s 2025, of course this short teaser includes a direct reference to the various <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shrek_fandom&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shrek_fandom" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>Shrek </em>memes and bizarre fan creations</a></span> that have been floating around the internet for over a decade now.

The game is being positioned as the future of <em>Pokémon</em>’s competitive play, as evidenced by the teaser trailer showing players using items like Game Boy link cables to battle, all culminating in a modern-day battle between a Switch user and a mobile player in <em>Champions</em>. While the average trainer is probably most excited to return to Kalos in <em>Pokémon Legends: Z-A</em>, <em>Champions </em>could fundamentally change how competitive <em>Pokémon </em>operates, and by extension open up a design space for RPGs like <em>Z-A</em>.</p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="196165" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="What’s Coming Out Beyond Pokémon: The Indigo Disk | The Week In Games" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="95" data-playlist="196165,195519,195618" data-current="196165"><div><p>What’s Coming Out Beyond Pokémon: The Indigo Disk | The Week In Games</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196165/196165_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196165/196165_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196165/196165_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196165/196165_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/21711.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>Let’s start with what we know. <em>Pokémon Champions </em>is a battle simulation game that won’t be tied to a specific RPG. Right now, competitive players battle in whatever the current mainline <em>Pokémon </em>is, so the best trainers in the scene are battling in <em>Scarlet </em>and <em>Violet</em> in official tournaments. This naturally limits the Pokémon players can use, as well as the <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/pokemon-battle-best-gimmicks-mega-evolution-tera-types-1850736746&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-battle-best-gimmicks-mega-evolution-tera-types-1850736746">gimmick mechanics</a></span> they can utilize. <em>Champions</em>, meanwhile, will not be tied to a specific game and can import different Pokémon from the <em>Pokémon Home</em> storage app (though The Pokémon Company makes clear <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://pokemon.gamespress.com/POKEMON-EXPANDS-ENTERTAINMENT-OFFERINGS-WITH-NEW-WAYS-TO-PLAY-IN-THE-P&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://pokemon.gamespress.com/POKEMON-EXPANDS-ENTERTAINMENT-OFFERINGS-WITH-NEW-WAYS-TO-PLAY-IN-THE-P" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">in its press release</a></span> that there will be some restrictions). The trailer also shows that <em>Champions</em> supports different gameplay mechanics like Mega Evolution and Terastallization, indicating that it might be possible to use different strategies that aren’t beholden to a game-specific rule set.</p><p>Just how freely we’ll be able to customize rules and party compositions remains to be seen, but The Pokémon Company creating an officially licensed battle simulator similar to the third-party ones used by competitive pros that aren’t limited to the current generation is a huge deal. This means professional players and the average fan will no longer be tied to one another. Official <em>Pokémon </em>tournaments won’t be limited to specific RPGs’ rosters, and mainline games could get more experimental without being chained to a competitive scene.</p><p><em>Pokémon Legends: Arceus </em>is one of the most innovative games the series has released in the past decade. It has new battle mechanics like the agile and strong style moves that let you choose to prioritize speed or power, which would be considered “broken” in competitive play. But <em>Legends: Arceus </em>doesn’t have multiplayer battles and doesn’t have to design its turn-based gameplay around whether or not something is fair to a rival trainer. As a result, some of the game’s big story battles are among the most challenging and interesting the series has ever put out. As a non-competitive player, some of the most strategic plays I’ve ever had to make in a <em>Pokémon </em>game’s main story involved making decisions about whether or not to use agile attacks to try and get in a few extra hits, or put everything I had into a strong one in hopes of knocking an enemy out in one shot. </p><p>This was a simple tweak to long-established <em>Pokémon </em>mechanics, but if Game Freak can develop RPGs without having to account for a completely different way they might be played in tournaments, it could mean cool innovations like this in future games. <em>Legends: Z-A</em> even introduces its own spin on <em>Pokémon</em> battles by incorporating positioning and area-of-effect to make use of the walkable 3D combat zones. Cool changes like this are only possible if we stop worrying about competitive viability and make space for innovative RPG design.</p><p>Severing competitive tournaments from the RPGs is a good thing for everyone, and some of the biggest names in professional <em>Pokémon </em>battling have expressed that having their own space to play and experiment could be a game changer for the scene.</p><p>There are still a lot of questions for both competitive and casual players, but the potential possibilities <em>Pokémon Champions</em> could bring to all sides of the community make it the most exciting part of the Presents showcase. I’m stoked for <em>Legends: Z-A</em>, but in the long run, I’m even more interested in how the <em>Pokémon </em>series could keep changing for the better.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
