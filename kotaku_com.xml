              <p><em>Final Fantasy VII</em> has one of the best openings of a video game ever. The remake cranks that up even further thanks to the the mash-up of modern graphics and <span tabindex="0" role="tooltip"><span tabindex="0" role="button" data-enable-toggle-animation="true" data-extra-container-classes="ZLo7Eb" data-hover-hide-delay="1000" data-hover-open-delay="500" data-send-open-event="true" data-theme="0" data-width="250" data-ved="2ahUKEwj_uaPDo7iPAxX0F1kFHQb7I5kQmpgGegQIJhAD"><span data-bubble-link="" data-segment-text="Nobuo Uematsu">Nobuo Uematsu’s classic score. I’m pleased to report the magic is still there on Switch 2. Digital Foundry said it <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/digitalfoundry.bsky.social/post/3lx6fxspghc2r">might be the best-looking port on the handheld hybrid yet</a>. Nothing in my time with it led me to think otherwise. And man, does that first mission still hit.&nbsp;</span></span></span></p> <p>For the uninitiated, the opening mission has a former corporate solider teaming up with an anarcho-terrorist cell to blow up a power plant that is helping to kill the planet. Combined with the slick hybrid turn-based combat, it’s a perfect tutorial that also sets the big-picture stakes for the rest of the adventure.</p> <p>I briefly tested <em>Final Fantasy VII Remake Intergrade</em> at PAX West this past weekend and was relieve to see it doesn’t seem to be suffering from <a href="https://kotaku.com/star-wars-outlaws-switch-2-assassins-creed-shadows-framerate-2000621760">some of the issues</a> that appear to be hindering other Switch 2 ports. Square Enix <a href="https://x.com/finalfantasyvii/status/1960711660592873862">recently promised</a> the newest version of the RPG would run at a stable 30fps with “smooth performance and crisp visuals” and my roughly 20 minutes with the opening mission backs that up. Even in handheld mode it performed well with no obvious visual shortcomings. The game still controls great, and after <a href="https://kotaku.com/ff7-rebirth-switch-2-remake-square-enix-release-date-1851779556">dozens of hours with <em>Rebirth</em> last year</a>, I’d forgotten just satisfying those early moments of the first game look and feel.</p>

 <figure id="attachment_2000622098" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000622098"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000622098">Square Enix</figcaption></figure> <p>It’s worth noting that I didn’t have enough time to defeat the Scorpion Sentinel and make it out of the No. 1 reactor before it blows up, so I didn’t get to explore <em>Remake Intergrade</em>‘s more open and NPC-filled slums. It’s possible these portions of the game will strain it more on Switch 2. Based on that early section, though, it seems like there’s a decent chance the new hardware’s features will help it come out of the most demanding sections relatively unscathed. <em>Remake Intergrade</em> came out five years ago, but nothing about it looks “old” on Switch 2.</p> <p>Will I go back and replay it once it’s out? Not without some sort of cross-save feature, which the Switch 2 version doesn’t support. But it’s neat that another excellent game will get a second lease on life with Nintendo’s new hardware, and it doesn’t appear to be cutting any performance corners in the process. There’s no exact release date yet <a href="https://kotaku.com/final-fantasy-vii-remake-intergrade-s-yuffie-mission-is-1847082454">but <em>Remake Intergrade</em></a> is expected to arrive sometime over the winter.</p>

              <p>Apple is know for keeping its prices steady, and discounts on its most popular products are basically a rarity. Still, a little digging can pay off because Amazon sometimes surprises with deals you’d never see on Apple’s official store. Take this AirTag 4-pack, for example: I<a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3844/">t normally runs $99 directly from Apple, but Amazon has dropped it down to $69</a>.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3844/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Why would you care about a little tracker?</h2>
<p>Because losing your keys, backpack or luggage is frustrating, and an AirTag eliminates that problem with no effort. Installation takes as little as tapping it once on your iPhone or iPad, and you’re finished: it pairs up right away. Then you can slip one into your wallet, attach one to your keys or slide one into your travel bag. The <em>Find My</em> app is pre-installed on every iPhone and then shows you where your things are.</p>
<p>If you misplace them at home, the AirTag will even play a sound to help you find them. And if they’re out of reach, <strong>Apple’s global network of billion devices is behind the scenes helping guide you to them</strong>. That means if your bag is left at a café or your suitcase ends up at the wrong airport, there’s a good chance you’ll be able to track it down.</p>
<p>The beauty of this pack is that four trackers cover most of your daily essentials (and one AirTag usually sells for $29): One can go on your keys, another in your wallet, a third for your backpack and the last one for your luggage. Once installed, you barely need to think about them again. The battery lasts for about a year before you’ll have to replace it and it uses a standard coin-cell battery that you can buy at any store. Replacing it is seconds.</p>



<p>What’s also great is how well AirTags blend into the Apple ecosystem: If you already possess an iPhone, iPad, or a MacBook, you don’t need any additional software or tedious pairing processes. It is all managed with Find My. For locating when near and ultra-wideband technology gives you precise directions on your iPhone screen, leading you to within inches of what you lost.</p>
<p>On top of all that, this 4-pack has a <strong>solid customer rating of 4.8 out of 5 stars based on nearly 30,000 reviews</strong>. That amount of feedback suggests these are not a gimmick, and they are correcting actual problems. And for $69, you’re basically getting a little over $17 per tracker, and that’s quite a bargain for the added peace of mind the next time you’re running through an airport terminal or simply can’t keep track of where you left your house keys.</p>

              <p>Amazon skipped laptop deals during Prime Day, but it clearly saved the best for the back-to-school rush. And honestly, you don’t have to be a student to appreciate the kind of discounts popping up right now. Maybe the best deal is on this HP 15.6-inch laptop with Intel i3 processor, massive 32GB RAM, and great 1TB solid-state drive. The <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3843/">normal price is $2499, yet Amazon has chopped it all the way down to $499</a>: <strong>that’s 80% off and basically one-fifth of what you’d usually pay</strong>. On top of that, it carries an impressive 4.7 out of 5 rating from buyers.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3843/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Why You Should Consider Buying It</h2>
<p>First off, the memory and storage bundle is significantly more than you’d get at this pricing: With 32GB of DDR4 RAM, you’re not bogged down with chores on a daily level. It means having dozens of tabs in your browser open, video streaming and you still have room to breathe. And then there’s the 1TB PCIe SSD. That amount of fast storage doesn’t just give loads of space for files, movies, and software — it also gets the laptop up and running in a snap.</p>
<p>The processor inside it is built to handle everyday needs with ease: It’s an Intel N100, capable of up to 3.4GHz when Turbo Boost kicks in. Yes, it’s not a workstation beast or a gaming processor, but for project-carrying students or remote workers with conferencing apps, it delivers. Coupled with Intel UHD Graphics, it can manage regular entertainment like Netflix or even light edit work without breaking a sweat.</p>



<p>The display is significant as well, and in this case, you’re getting a 15.6-inch Full HD (1920×1080) display. It’s anti-glare to make working in bright lights or in windows less stressful and its thin bezels give you more usable screen space in a footprint that’s not intimidating. At 250 nits of brightness and with 45% NTSC color, it’s aimed at comfortable streaming.</p>
<p>Despite the big screen and powerful internals, it weighs just 3.64 pounds and measures only 0.73 inches thick. That makes it easy to slip into a backpack or carry between classes or office meetings. The inclusion of WiFi 6E keeps you connected quickly and dependably and Bluetooth 5.3 has you pairing headphones and other peripherals effortlessly. The laptop adds a couple of ports as well: a USB-C, two USB-A, HDMI, and a headphone jack.</p>
<p>Plugged into Windows 11 Pro, this machine is ready for work right out of the box. You’re greeted with a bare-bones interface, Microsoft’s latest apps, and business-class features that help with security and workflow on a day-to-day basis.</p>
<p>All of that for $499, and you can see why this buy is so surprising.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>In need of expanding your PC storage space? <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3807/">Samsung is here to help with a series of SSDs at various capacities all on sale for Labor Day.</a> <strong>The Samsung 990 EVO Plus</strong> with 1TB of space has been chopped down by 38% which brings it from $105 to just $65 — saving you $40.
