A new character? Or someone related to a previous villain? Maybe Handsome Jack had a brother or a dad or a really close friend? </p><p>We also see a ton of new guns and planets in the gameplay trailer during a montage. And at the end of that, there’s a moment where the player uses a holo-grapple hook-thingy and zips up to a higher area in a few seconds. Older <em>Borderlands </em>games didn’t have this much mobility, but <em>Borderlands 3</em> did add mantling and more movement options. It seems the fourth entry in Gearbox’s sci-fi franchise will add even more ways to move around while killing bandits and looting weapons. </p><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/borderlands-4-teaser-trailer-2025-release-date-1851627084&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/borderlands-4-teaser-trailer-2025-release-date-1851627084"><em>Borderlands 4 </em>was previously announced in August</a></span>.

The hit open-world RPG that just got a GOTY-nominated expansion is coming back with a completely new spin-off in 2025. It’s called <em>Elden Ring: Nightreign </em>and it’s a co-op action adventure that looks as excellent as the game it’s based on. </p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="195502" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="The Most Sought After Elden Ring Sword Has A Storied History" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="307" data-playlist="195502,195624,196773" data-current="195502"><div><p>The Most Sought After Elden Ring Sword Has A Storied History</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195502/195502_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195502/195502_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195502/195502_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195502/195502_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/20979.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>The standalone game takes place in a world parallel to the one in the 2022 game and will pit players against randomized  encounters in a smaller version of the map every time they pick up and play. The challenges will scale through a day-night cycle with players facing a Nightlord boss on the third night. It’ll be on PlayStation 5, PS4, Xbox Series X/S, Xbox One, and PC. FromSoftware says players will never experience the same playthrough twice.</p><p>Take a look:</p><p>Multiple players will be able to band together against tough enemies and brutal bosses in what seems almost like a live-service roguelite. They’ll explore dangerous parts of the map for better weapons and greater Rune rewards and uncover Sites of Grace to level up heroes. Each run will get players closer to unravelling the story and bestow lasting stat bonuses.&nbsp;</p><p>There also seems to be more flexibility and versatility in how characters move, suggesting combat might be a little more twitchy and arcade-y than that in the original <em>Elden Ring</em>. The smaller scale of the world might also allow <em>Nightreign</em> to explore some design elements more deeply than the first game. </p><p>FromSoftware director Hidetaka Miyazaki previously said that the studio had no plans to work on an <em>Elden Ring</em> sequel but that multiple other projects exploring other genres were in production. <em>Nightreign</em> certainly fits that description, and probably means that even though we’re getting more <em>Elden Ring</em>, we won’t be getting a direct sequel after all anytime soon. </p><p>The studio’s majority owner, Kadokawa Corporation, is currently looking at a potential merger with Sony. While the acquisition seems targeted at the parent company’s vast media holdings, which include anime, manga, and online streaming distribution, the maker of<em> Elden Ring</em> and <em>Dark Souls </em>joining the larger PlayStation portfolio is no doubt part of the appeal.</p><p>.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
