            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>I was very skeptical of <a href="https://kotaku.com/magic-gathering-record-final-fantasy-hasbro-2000668256"><em>Magic: The Gathering</em>‘s rapid return</a> to the streets of New York for a <em>Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles</em> pizza party. I still am. But the set is full of a surprising amount of love for the franchise’s strong video game roots that has me softening my stance a bit.</p> <p>I’ve seen all of the <em>Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles</em> movies, played most of the games, watched a ton of the cartoons, read some of the comics, and played with plenty of action figures. I’m a millennial who was old enough to play <em>Turtles</em> in the arcade, watch them on Saturday mornings, and longingly eye the racks of toys in ’90s department stores. What I’m saying is that, as a frequent <em>MTG</em> enjoyer as well, I’m the perfect mark for a <a href="https://magic.wizards.com/en/news/feature/collecting-teenage-mutant-ninja-turtles"><em>TMNT</em> Universes Beyond set</a>.</p>

 <p>But I initially greeted news of the expansion with a groan. <em>MTG</em> fatigue has been setting in on a few different levels. We’re not even six months removed from <a href="https://kotaku.com/mtg-spider-man-ff-prices-ebay-preorder-sold-out-1851767413">last year’s New York-centric <em>Spider-Man</em> set</a>, and just a few months away from a <a href="https://kotaku.com/magic-gathering-mtg-horn-greed-heroic-intervention-2000651812">Marvel Super Heroes expansion</a> bringing more Manhattan flavor to the card game. Plus, there’s the rapid pace of new launches. <em>Avatar: The Last Airbender</em> still feels fresh; <em>Lorwyn Eclipsed</em> seems like it just came out yesterday.</p> <figure id="attachment_2000669819" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000669819"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000669819">Wizards</figcaption></figure> <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/magic-gathering-mtg-star-trek-marvel-avengers-2026-sets-2000629313">It’s too much too soon</a>. <em>TMNT</em> releasing on March 6 only adds to the exhaustion. And yet I can already feel myself coming around thanks to the clever ways Wizards is trying to imbue the set with an identity drawn from multiple sources. Some cards are callbacks to the animated series, some use art from the comics, and others play into moments and aesthetics from the most recent <em>TMNT</em> movie, 2023’s<em>&nbsp;<a href="https://kotaku.com/tmnt-mutant-mayhem-video-game-ninja-turtles-movie-date-1850810080">Mutant Mayhem</a></em>. Each era and sensibility gets some special attention.</p>

 <p>Instead of relying on just the characters and conflicts to drive the lore and flavor, the expansion is effectively a multi-decade tribute to a larger pop-culture phenomenon. Different cards will tug at different parts of players’ nostalgia. For me, it’s the <a href="https://kotaku.com/tmnt-ninja-turtles-best-games-teenage-mutant-mayhem-1850719693/2">video game legacy</a> that has me excited to start ripping packs with friends. The set both calls back to home console and arcade classics and channels that spirit into certain mechanics.</p>

 <figure id="attachment_2000669821" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000669821"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000669821">Wizards</figcaption></figure> <p>First, there’s the borderless pixel art cards which just look really rad. Not only are the characters pixel art but you also get 8-bit-looking color symbols and text box windows. You also have a range of video-game-themed cards like Level Up, which gives you double +1/+1 counters after attacking, and High Score, which lets you draw cards for having the strongest creature on the board. Arcade Cabinet, meanwhile, leans into the +1/+1 counter strategy with a neat four-player nod.</p> <p>Let’s talk about Commander.&nbsp;<em>TMNT</em> introduces a completely novel concept to the popular MTG offshoot: coop. Instead of just one Commander card, you can have two as long as the card has “Partner.” Combine Leonardo and Donatello to create a token +1/+1 counter engine that will make everyone else at the table lose their minds as you try to keep track of your board.</p>

   <p>And then there’s the call-outs to particular <em>TMNT</em> moments unique to the games. Shredder, Shadow Master creates copies of himself like in the arcade game’s final boss fight. The art for Leatherhead, meanwhile, is a riff on the Wild West theme from the alligator’s SNES <em>Turtles In Time</em> appearance. Most iconic of all is a card called Electric Seaweed, a plant wall which will instantly be recognizable and terrifying to everyone who died in the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjUnn3sXt_Q">bomb-defusing level in the NES game</a>.</p> <p>Wizards is having a lot of fun with this set and getting creative in unexpected ways. There are land cards with pizza art where each slice represents a different color based on the toppings. Dr. Baxter’s Mousers are some of the coolest-looking token creature cards out in a while. Krang, a mythic robot, is a perfect stompy creature, as he should be. Would it have been nice if <em>TMNT</em> was still a few months off? Yes. Would I have loved if we only got one Universes Beyond set per year? Absolutely.</p> <p>But Wizards is giving me everything I would have wanted from a <em>Turtle</em>s set. In the meantime, I’m going to go grab a pie and a two liter and fire up the excellent <em>Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: The Cowabunga Collection</em>.</p>

              <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/bethesda-skyrim-port-switch-2-upgrade-free-release-date-trailer-dlc-2000651683"><em>The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim</em> on Switch 2</a> is looking and playing better after a new update added a much-requested 60FPS mode and plenty of fixes and tweaks to the game.</p> <p>In December 2025, <a href="https://kotaku.com/skyrim-elder-scrolls-switch-2-port-60fps-30fps-compare-price-input-lag-fix-patch-2000652156">Bethesda shadowdropped the 15-year-old open-world RPG <em>The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim</em></a> onto the Nintendo Switch 2. But unlike <a href="https://kotaku.com/oblivion-remaster-elder-scrolls-eso-glitch-meme-1851777557">the last time the company surprise released an <em>Elder Scrolls</em> game</a>, the reaction to <em>Skyrim</em> on Switch 2 wasn’t positive. Many players were upset over the game’s poor performance, visual glitches, bugs, and bloated install size. Well, Bethesda has fixed some of these problems with a new update out now on Nintendo’s hybrid handheld.</p> <p>On Tuesday, <a href="https://x.com/BethesdaStudios/status/2023799788936867979">Bethesda released update 1.2 for <em>Skyrim</em> on the Switch 2</a>. The big news is that this free patch added a 60FPS performance mode. Bethesda has also locked <em>Skyrim</em>‘s framerate to 30FPS when playing in “Prioritize Visuals” mode. Either choice should provide a smoother, more stable experience compared to what <em>Skyrim</em> on Switch 2 played like previously.</p>

 <p>In the patch notes for the update shared online on February 17, Bethesda also dedicated two different sections to addressing fixes made to the game’s performance and visual bugs. This includes improved performance in certain areas, like the Talking Stone giant camp and during combat at Secunda’s Kiss. Issues with water not looking correct from a distance or while in a menu have been fixed, too.</p> <p>While it can be frustrating how often <a href="https://kotaku.com/fallout-4s-10th-anniversary-update-is-a-complete-shit-show-that-nobody-wanted-2000642938">Bethesda seemingly breaks their own classic RPGs with updates and ports</a>, I am happy that the studio seems committed to going back and fixing problems. And hey, if Bethesda doesn’t fix it, at least PC players can rely on talented modders to pick up the slack. Switch 2 and other console players are still at the mercy of Bethesda, though.</p> <hr> <p>Here are the full patch notes for the 1.2 <em>Skyrim</em> update on Switch 2:</p> <div dir="ltr"> <p><span

            <title><![CDATA[The Source Of Highguard‘s Mysterious Funding Was Reportedly Chinese Tech Giant Tencent]]></title>
            <link>https://kotaku.com/highguard-wildlight-tencent-funding-layoffs-servers-2000669790</link>
            <guid>1438750</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Developers at Wildlight Entertainment were very open about <a href="https://kotaku.com/highguard-the-kotaku-review-is-it-good-free-ps5-pc-5v5-3v3-update-patch-2000664646"><em>Highguard</em>‘s development</a> back when it launched last month. Everything except where the money to make it came from. A week after mass layoffs at the studio, it’s come out that the source of funding for the hero shooter’s four-year development cycle may have been Chinese conglomerate Tencent.</p> <p>That’s according to a <a href="https://www.gamefile.news/p/tencent-highguard-wildlight-entertainment?utm_source=post-email-title&amp;publication_id=66124&amp;post_id=188295226&amp;utm_campaign=email-post-title&amp;isFreemail=false&amp;r=155iz&amp;triedRedirect=true&amp;utm_medium=email">new report by <em>Game File</em></a>. It claims Tencent studio group&nbsp;TiMi, responsible for online hits like <em>Honor of Kings</em> and military multiplayer shooter <em>Delta Force</em>, is the one backing Wildlight Entertainment.</p> <p>Wildlight was cofounded by <a href="https://kotaku.com/highguard-game-awards-trailer-rust-hero-shooter-interview-2000663137">ex-Respawn Entertainment veterans</a> who worked on<em> Titanfall</em> and <em>Apex Legends</em>. But unlike many recent startups which happily publicize their investment backers, Wildlight has kept that fact a secret. When pressed about the studio’s funding last month <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2026-01-30/-highguard-maker-wildlight-entertainment-talks-about-the-game-s-dramatic-launch">by <em>Bloomberg</em></a>, CEO Dusty Welch said, “We don’t really speak publicly about the business, and the economics and the financials of our company.”</p>

 <p>As <em>Game File</em> points out, it’s unclear why the relationship has been kept secret. Tencent is no stranger to investing <a href="https://kotaku.com/the-world-s-biggest-game-company-just-keeps-getting-big-1826294558">in Western game studios</a> and companies. It has billions in holdings across companies big and small, from Larian Studios and FromSoftware to Epic Games and Ubisoft. Usually these are just partial financial stakes. In Wildlight’s case, TiMi appears to have been the primary backer.</p> <p>Questions about the funding have taken center stage following Wildlight’s layoffs last week and fan questions about just how much longer the live-service game <a href="https://kotaku.com/highguard-layoffs-dead-game-awards-live-service-2000668192"><em>Highguard</em> can continue</a> in its current state. It’s lost over 95 percent of concurrent players on PC from its peak at launch, even as an unknown pool continues to play on console.</p>

 <p>As a free-to-play shooter, its revenue comes entirely from in-game microtransactions for skins and battle passes, things players are much less likely to buy when they think a game won’t stick around. Wildlight has yet to update players on the game’s revised roadmap or future plans and today, <em>Highguard</em>‘s official website was discovered to <a href="https://kotaku.com/highguard-website-down-shutting-down-servers-free-to-play-shooter-steam-playercount-2000669734">have been taken offline</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><span>Between the game’s seasonal crops, time-locked fish, and pressure to keep up relationships with townspeople, most </span><i><span>Stardew Valley </span></i><span>players wouldn’t think of wasting a single in-game day by going to sleep early. Squeezing every possible hour of productivity out of the workday might just be the difference between completing the game’s Community Center and having to wait another in-game year to finish the challenge. However, one player has now done the unthinkable and slept through…an entire 1,000 in-game years.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>Late last week, Reddit user Holozard </span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/StardewValley/comments/1r3xzkg/slept_for_1000_years_straight/"><span>shared</span></a><span> screenshots of their absolutely ridiculous farm, which they left unattended while sleeping in-game for what has to be a record-breaking stretch of time (</span><span>thanks</span><span>, </span><a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/simulation/stardew-valley-fan-recreates-wait-for-haunted-chocolatier-by-sleeping-for-1-000-years-in-the-farming-sim-wakes-up-to-sea-of-giant-mushrooms-and-chickens-that-are-immortal-but-understandably-grumpy/"><i><span>Gamesradar</span></i></a><span>). To put Holozard’s 1,000-year slumber into perspective, I’ve probably only gone through five or six years across all my farms despite putting hundreds of hours into the game.</span></p>

 <p><span>Holozard apparently accomplished the absurd task by running their Switch for three weeks straight. The process involved wrapping a hair tie around the joystick to get their farmer to walk toward their bed automatically and using a controller’s turbo function to hit the rest button.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>Their screenshots show off the most abandoned farm I’ve ever seen. Predictably, it’s absolutely overgrown and covered in rocks, grass, and trees. But it’s also covered in some pretty neat spawns that most players have never seen.&nbsp;</span></p>

   <p><span>Most of </span><i><span><a href="https://kotaku.com/stardew-valley-tips-tricks-beginner-2000669702">Stardew Valley</a>’s</span></i><span> random events work overnight, meaning every time a player sleeps, the game has a chance to select a random event. Some of these events are pretty rare and have less than a 1 percent chance to occur (and even if one of these rare events does happen, the game might still randomly select an incompatible tile, causing nothing to actually show up).&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><span>But it turns out, if you sleep for 1,000 years, even the game’s rarest events become common. Holozard’s screenshots show a farm littered with meteorites, mushroom trees, and stone owls, all rare items that have impressively low chances to spawn. Looking at these screenshots and trying to parse everything is like playing a messed up version of Where’s Waldo, but it looks like 1,000 years still wasn’t enough to land them the strange capsule item, another rare spawn that I can’t see anywhere in the screenshot. Maybe their farm became too overgrown before the item had the space to spawn?</span></p> <p><span>While poor Holozard had to go through a pretty tedious cleanup process (they said it took them three entire seasons to chop down the mushroom trees alone), it was apparently pretty profitable. “I now have lots of cool purple rocks all over my farm, and made almost half a million in mushrooms, so I’m happy,” they wrote in a Reddit comment.</span></p>

 <p><span>Holozard’s technique is quite the niche way to collect cash, but I guess if you’re desperate to fund your farm and have a spare hair tie and turbo controller, maybe sleeping for a while and crossing your fingers is worth a shot.
