That movie was independently produced and then picked up by Disney, and went on to become a big hit, spawning 14 sequels and spin-offs. Yes. That’s not a typo. There have been 14 follow-ups to a movie about a dog that plays basketball. Weirdly, most of them have nothing to do with basketball. </p><p><em>Air Bud Returns</em> is being written and directed by Robert Vince. He was a producer on the original <em>Air Bud</em> film in the ‘90s and then produced all 14 sequels, as well as writing and directing 10 of them.</p><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/air-bud-returns-aint-no-rule-says-a-dog-cant-release-another-movie-302512830.html&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/air-bud-returns-aint-no-rule-says-a-dog-cant-release-another-movie-302512830.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Here’s the official synopsis of the upcoming movie</a></span>, which is set to start filming this summer in British Columbia, Canada: </p><blockquote data-type="BlockQuote"><p> In <em>Air Bud Returns</em>, 12-year-old Jacob has always dreamt of being a star basketball player. After the passing of his father, that dream felt even more impossible. But everything changes when he and his mom move into his dad’s childhood home in Fernfield. There, Jacob discovers an original VHS of the <em>Air Bud</em> movie in his father’s belongings and has a chance meeting of a stray golden retriever he names Buddy. Together they embark on a journey of healing, unite a team of misfits, and chase a championship. Through it all they learn to play from the heart, believe in each other, and always take the shot!</p></blockquote><p> “<em>Air Bud Returns</em> isn’t just another sequel or remake—it’s a unique story,” said Vince in a press release. “This movie will engage nostalgic <em>Air Bud </em>fans while introducing a new generation to the beloved basketball-playing golden retriever, Buddy. It builds upon the legacy of the OG <em>Air Bud</em> with all the fun, the magic, heartwarming scenes, and Buddy playing basketball. More than anything, it’s a deeply human story about a dog and boy, centered on themes of adaptation, redemption, and teamwork.”</p><p>I can’t say I’m excited for a new <em>Air Bud </em>movie, as the previous films have all been low-quality, straight-to-DVD garbage made on the cheap in an effort to milk a decades-old franchise. But hey, maybe this one will be good. Or not. There’s not a damn thing I can do to influence that. The universe is a chaotic place that can’t be controlled by any one person. Events happen. We live through them. <em>Air Bud Returns </em>hits theaters next year. </p><p> .<br></p></div></div><br/><br/>https://kotaku.com/air-bud-returns-air-bud-15-new-film-2026-poster-teaser-1851786906]]></content:encoded>

The handhelds were $200 each, much more than the Android-based emulation devices currently flooding the retro gaming market. </p><p>The M64 will start at the same price point, however. “Inflation isn’t nostalgic,” Luckey quipped, noting that his Nintendo 64 clone will be launching at the same price as the original did back in 1996. It’s not the only device hoping to capitalize on N64 nostalgia this year, though. Analogue announced its own years ago and the Analogue 3D <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/analogue-3d-n64-nintendo-ship-date-delay-tariff-1851786334&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/analogue-3d-n64-nintendo-ship-date-delay-tariff-1851786334">is finally getting ready to ship beginning next month</a></span>, though it will cost $50 more than the M64. </p><p>That’s right, there will soon be at least two FGPA-based N64 tributes on the market. Nintendo now has the chance to do the funniest thing and finally release its own N64 classic fans have long requested. While diehard enthusiasts will still opt for more premium alternatives, it would save everyone else who just wants to recreate that old Christmas morning fun with a few rounds of Mario Kart a lot of money. </p><p>.</p></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://kotaku.com/m64-mario-kart-modretro-palmer-luckey-nintendo-64-1851786895]]></content:encoded>
