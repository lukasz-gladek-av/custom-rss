              <p><span>According to Rémi Verschelde, project manager of Godot Engine and co-founder of the platform’s financial backer W4 Games, the never-ending wave of “AI slop” pull requests on Godot’s GitHub is becoming “increasingly draining and demoralizing” for its maintainers, to the point that over 4,600 pull requests are currently open on the engine’s GitHub page.</span></p> <p><span>As spotted by </span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/programming/godot-co-founder-says-ai-slop-pull-requests-have-become-overwhelming"><i><span>Game Developer</span></i></a><span>, Verschelde’s comment on Bluesky was made in response to a post by Adriaan de Jongh, the developer and publisher of the 2017 indie puzzle hit </span><i><span>Hidden Folks</span></i><span>, </span><a href="https://bsky.app/profile/adriaan.games/post/3mexoxyaui22x"><span>which stated</span></a><span> that Godot’s GitHub has been overrun with countless undisclosed AI-generated pull requests. “Changes often make no sense, descriptions are extremely verbose, users don’t understand their own changes…It’s a total shitshow.”</span></p> <div><blockquote data-bluesky-uri="at://did:plc:v6vo5mafc2uirknvv5jegtzz/app.bsky.feed.post/3meyerixvhs2p" data-bluesky-cid="bafyreifnwjboai3ml34oyyl7f2o3d7dtktxqmqrbt5hepzzs4xebfw2qea"> <p lang="en">Honestly, AI slop PRs are becoming increasingly draining and demoralizing for #Godot maintainers.</p> <p>If you want to help, more funding so we can pay more maintainers to deal with the slop (on top of everything we do already) is the only viable solution I can think of:</p> <p>fund.godotengine.org</p> <p>— <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/did:plc:v6vo5mafc2uirknvv5jegtzz?ref_src=embed">Rémi Verschelde (@akien.bsky.social)</a> <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/did:plc:v6vo5mafc2uirknvv5jegtzz/post/3meyerixvhs2p?ref_src=embed">2026-02-16T15:33:57.699Z</a></p></blockquote></div>  <p><a href="https://bsky.app/profile/akien.bsky.social/post/3meyerixvhs2p"><span>In reply</span></a><span>, Verschelde noted that the problem has become such an issue that Godot’s GitHub maintainers are being forced to “second guess every [pull request] from new contributors, multiple times per day.” Although he stated that Godot prides itself on “being welcoming to new contributors,” Verschelde also doesn’t see a way out of the situation, beyond further donations to help pay more maintainers. “Maintainers spend a lot of time assisting new contributors to help them get PRs in a mergeable state. I don’t know how long we can keep it up.”</span></p>

 <p><span>A cursory glance at the </span><a href="https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pulls?q=is%3Apr+is%3Aclosed"><span>closed pull requests</span></a><span> on Godot’s GitHub page proves that this isn’t an exaggeration, as dozens of pull requests have been denied or reported as spam by Godot’s maintainers within the past month alone, with comments left by maintainers pointing out AI-written code appearing on a daily basis. Godot has been used to ship a bunch of hit indie games over the last few years like <em>Brotato</em> and <em>Until Then</em> and is a valuable alternative to proprietary game engines like Unity, which have been <a href="https://kotaku.com/unity-promises-deluge-of-new-games-prompted-into-existence-by-ai-as-its-stock-tanks-2000669483">rolling out their own genAI tools</a>.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>While Verschelde stated that paying more maintainers would be the simplest option, he also stated that Godot may have to raise “the barrier to entry” for its contributors instead. When quizzed about the possibility of automating the process, </span><a href="https://bsky.app/profile/akien.bsky.social/post/3meyf4t77ds2p"><span>he replied</span></a><span> that it “seems horribly ironic to have to run an AI on our CI to detect AI slop.” </span><a href="https://bsky.app/profile/chetsucks.com/post/3mextjgn2g22i"><span>Chet Faliszek</span></a><span>, writer for several Valve titles including </span><i><span>Left 4 Dead</span></i><span>, </span><i><span>Portal 2</span></i><span>, and </span><i><span>Half-Life 2: Episode One</span></i><span>, believes that the onus to fix the system should be on GitHub instead. “Really is just exhausting to watch all this playout and github promoting this, not fighting it.”</span></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Disney and Lucasfilm released the latest trailer for <em>The Mandalorian and Grogu</em>, the first new <em>Star Wars</em> movie since <em>Rise of Skywalker</em> hit theaters back in 2019, and it includes everything I want from a movie set in this famous galaxy: eierd aliens, sci-fi action, deep cut references, and a voice cameo from famed director Martin Scorsese.</p> <p>The upcoming <em>Star Wars</em> flick stars Pedro Pascal as fan-favorite bounty hunter Din Djarin alongside his faithful little buddy Grogu, aka Baby Yoda. Set after the events of the original trilogy and the <em>Mandalorian</em> TV series, this new movie, which hits theaters on May 22, is set to tie up plot threads involving the remnants of the Empire trying to destroy the New Republic. It will also likely provide more answers about Grogu, a member of Yoda’s species. Here’s the trailer:</p>

   <p>And yes, that shopkeeper alien we see at the start who gets spooked when asked to provide information about a Hutt is voiced by the one and only Martin Scorsese, the director behind films like <em>Goodfellas</em> and <em>The Wolf of Wall Street.&nbsp;</em><a href="https://www.polygon.com/martin-scorsese-joinins-star-wars-universe/">Disney confirmed as much with <em>Polygon</em></a>. I can’t wait to see how angry online commenters who can’t stop yelling about the famous director’s MCU comments will react to him appearing in what looks to be a big, dumb, super-expensive <em>Star Wars</em> summer blockbuster.</p> <p>As for the rest of the trailer, I’m super into all the weird, goofy aliens and monsters that appear in it. The fact that a <a href="https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Mantellian_Savrip">Mantellian Savrip</a> shows up at the very end of the trailer as the big monster alien Mando and Grogu fight in the city made me giggle a little, I have to admit. This is an alien that first appeared as one of the holochess pieces in the very first <em>Star Wars</em> movie. Cool to see it here in the flesh. <a href="https://x.com/sw_holocron/status/2023761695026577621">Meanwhile, seeing Embo</a>, a bounty hunter from the<em> Clone Wars</em> animated series, pop up was fun, as was seeing Zeb from <em>Rebels</em> show up again after first appearing in live action back in the original <em>Mando</em> show on Disney+.</p>

 <p>Will all these silly cameos and references be enough in and of themselves to make<em> Star Wars: The Mandalorian and Grogu</em> a good movie? Nope. But at least this thing seems like a big movie, and I’m happy about that. <em>Star Wars</em> belongs in theaters, even when it’s bad, and I’m happy that after a few years away, we are finally getting a new cinematic <em>Star Wars</em> adventure. Let’s just hope it’s halfway decent when it arrives in May.</p>

              <p>Just a few weeks after launch and less than three months after it was first announced at the Game Awards, <em>Highguard&nbsp;</em>is…still alive. But its official website is suddenly down, sparking online rumors that the game is not long for this world.</p> <p><a href="https://x.com/Mr_Rebs_/status/2023787343409205651?s=20">As spotted by Rebs Gaming</a> and others, earlier today, <a href="https://playhighguard.com/">the official PlayHighguard.com website</a> was replaced with a simple static page, featuring the game’s logo and a message that says: “This site is currently unavailable.” Below that is a support email to ping about the down site. <em>Kotaku</em> has contacted Wildlight Entertainment for more information.<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/HighGuardgame/comments/1r754vn/the_website_is_down/"> It seems the site has been down since at least 7:50 am EST</a>.</p>

A period of radio silence followed, leading to content creators filling the void with endless amounts of negative videos and online speculation running wild.</p> <p>When <a href="https://kotaku.com/highguard-the-kotaku-review-is-it-good-free-ps5-pc-5v5-3v3-update-patch-2000664646"><em>Highguard</em></a> finally did launch in January, it kicked off with over 90k concurrent players on Steam before <a href="https://kotaku.com/highguard-layoffs-dead-game-awards-live-service-2000668192">losing nearly all of them within 48 hours</a>. Later updates and <a href="https://kotaku.com/highguard-big-update-free-shooter-future-patch-notes-wildlight-2000664584">a 5v5 mode</a> didn’t bring people back. <a href="https://kotaku.com/highguard-studio-developer-layoffs-wildlight-entertainment-2000667841">Layoffs hit Wildlight Entertainment shortly after</a>. And now that the website for the game is down, people are wondering if this is it.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[This Is The Ultimate Trick Shot Of Pokémon Shiny Hunting]]></title>
            <link>https://kotaku.com/pokemon-shiny-hunting-odds-red-blue-moltres-crystal-2000669729</link>
            <guid>1438402</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><span>I’ve watched a lot of </span><i><span>Pok</span></i><i><span>é</span></i><i><span>mon </span></i><span>fans </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-shiny-odds-scarlet-violet-ivs-red-gyarados-1850248457"><span>shiny hunt</span></a><span> over the years, but somehow I’ve never actually witnessed what gaming YouTuber RaidAway just pulled off. Shiny Pokémon, the rare, alternate-colored version of the series’ monsters, were introduced in </span><i><span>Gold </span></i><span>and </span><i><span>Silver</span></i><span>, but because of how these rarities spawn in the early games, it’s possible that a Pok</span><span>é</span><span>mon who originates from the first generation games can turn out to be Shiny when they’re traded over. RaidAway encountered an example of exactly that, and he did it with not just any monster, but a Legendary one from </span><i><span>Pok</span></i><i><span>é</span></i><i><span>mon Blue</span></i><span>.</span></p> <p><span>Moltres, like the rest of the Legendary Birds in </span><i><span>Pokémon Red</span></i><span> and </span><i><span>Blue</span></i><span>, only spawns once per save file. You’ll find this flame-covered fowl late in the game at Victory Road, and if you fail to capture it the first time you approach it, you won’t get a second chance in that playthrough. Shiny hunting Legendary Pokémon is notoriously a hassle, as you have to reset your game multiple times, retriggering the same battle over and over, to see if you can find a rarer version of the most sought-after monsters in the game. RaidAway didn’t have to do that with Moltres on </span><i><span>Pokémon Blue</span></i><span>, and wouldn’t have been able to, as there was no indication that the bird was Shiny in the old game. However, when he traded it over to </span><i><span>Pokémon Crystal</span></i><span>, he saw the Moltres for what it truly was.</span></p>

 <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">I ACCIDENTALLY FOUND A SHINY MOLTRES IN POKEMON BLUE TRANSFERING TO CRYSTAL</p> <p>THIS IS THE MOST INSANE SHINY EVER.. <a href="https://t.co/cSqFR4wRN5">pic.twitter.com/cSqFR4wRN5</a></p> <p>— Rich (@RaidAway) <a href="https://twitter.com/RaidAway/status/2023570861320548712?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">February 17, 2026</a></p></blockquote>  <p><span>How is this possible? Back in Generation II, Shiny status was determined by a Pokémon’s Individual Values, which are essentially the monster’s genetic disposition toward certain stats. So if your IVs for Attack, Speed, Defense, etc. landed on a specific number combination in the back end, they’d show up in a new color. These points still existed in the first-gen games, but it wasn’t until the sequels that they gained this additional trait. So that’s why a monster traded up can still end up being Shiny, even if you can’t clock that when you catch them in </span><i><span>Red </span></i><span>and </span><i><span>Blue</span></i><span>.</span></p> <p><span>Shiny Moltres trades the yellow body of the original for a pink one, which means not only that this statistical anomaly is an impressive stroke of dumb luck, but that RaidAway also wound up with a prettier version of the bird. He explains on X that he was working on a </span><i><span>Crystal</span></i> <a href="https://x.com/RaidAway/status/2023783654636556441?s=20"><span>Living Dex</span></a><span>, which is a term for when a player has captured one of every Pokémon in one game. Typically, Shiny hunting is </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-battle-revolution-shiny-hunting-costumes-kyogre-2000667344"><span>an arduous task</span></a><span> that can take hours of banging your head against a wall until one shows up. But sometimes you get lucky and find one by accident. It’s just not often that it’s a Pokémon as rare as Moltres.&nbsp;</span></p>
