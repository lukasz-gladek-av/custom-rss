              <p>Technically, you can use your standard office monitor for gaming, but is it the same as a dedicated screen that’s built to chase enemies with exceptional refresh rates and near-instant response time? Not really.</p>
<p>You need gear that keeps up, and right now, you can upgrade without paying the full price. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4447/">Amazon has dropped the Samsung 24-Inch Odyssey G3 (G30D) to just $110, which is a massive 45% off.</a> You’re saving $90 on a display that’s going to make you feel like you’re in the middle of the action, but the discount ends soon.</p>

<h2>Mind-Boggling Refresh Rate, Stunning Screen</h2>
<p>Lags and blurs are frustrating. You can’t just sit and wait for your screen to catch up while your opponent gets away. Odyssey G3 packs an impressive 180Hz refresh rate and 1ms response time for ultra-fast visuals that give an in-game advantage. Jumping on an enemy squad the moment you spot them, or slipping away from a close fight, becomes much easier.</p>
<p>Bid farewell to image tearing and mid-action interruptions, too, because AMD Radeon FreeSync makes sure your monitor and graphics card stay in sync – always in real time. There’s Black Equalizer to brighten dark areas in the game, and Virtual Aim Point to line up shots more precisely. Basically, whether you’re checking dark corners for bad guys or going for the clutch shot, this monitor keeps up. Even better, blue light is actively minimized to keep your eyes comfortable, and reduced screen flicker makes it easier to fight the demons for longer.</p>



<p>As for the screen itself, you’re getting a decent 24-inch FHD display that pushes stunning, vibrant visuals. The 3-sided borderless design offers maximum space to play, and will also come in handy when you run a dual-monitor setup. The monitor’s height can be fully adjusted, and you can tilt, swivel, or pivot it to match your ideal setup. Port-wise, you’ll find a Power port, Headphone IN, HDMI IN, and a DisplayPort IN around the back.</p>
<p>If you’ve been playing on your standard monitor or laptop and want to upgrade to something more powerful, the Samsung 24-Inch Odyssey G3 (G30D) is an excellent option to consider. It gets you an exceptional display with an even better refresh rate and response time, which are sure to take your gaming experience up a notch. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4447/">The monitor usually retails for $200, but this deal brings it down to $110, which is a much more affordable price point.</a></p>
