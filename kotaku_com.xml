After season one ended with Gi-hun (Lee Jung-jae), also known as Player 456,  choosing to search for the people behind the game instead of boarding a flight to Los Angeles to reconnect with his daughter, we catch up with him two years later as he’s contracted a group of people to search for The Salesman (Gong Yoo), the man who recruits people into the game. The formerly naive Gi-hun is now a radicalized vigilante with a makeshift shooting range and illegal guns in his hotel room. But, that’s not the only change this season. </p><p>Over seven episodes, <em>Squid Game</em> introduces its first transgender character, shows us someone being recruited to be a guard, and turns more children’s games into chaos creators. It’s not all good, as some of the second season’s changes left us yearning for more. But one thing is for sure: these changes make it abundantly clear that we are entering the final episodes of <em>Squid Game</em> as a series. Let’s cherish them while we can.</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="fa2a16f2361db10f4303770ed7689ba7" data-recommend-id="image://fa2a16f2361db10f4303770ed7689ba7" data-format="png" data-width="1535" data-height="1038" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Two men about to play Russian Roulette" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Two men about to play Russian Roulette" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Netflix</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="fa2a16f2361db10f4303770ed7689ba7" data-recommend-id="image://fa2a16f2361db10f4303770ed7689ba7" data-format="png" data-width="1535" data-height="1038" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Two men about to play Russian Roulette" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>The central tension of the show has always been rooted in the deadly consequences of playing the show’s twisted versions of children’s games. In the past, <em>Squid Game </em>has turned Red Light, Green Light into a massacre machine, throwing marbles into a breeding ground for lethal deception, and literally put lives in people’s hands with Tug of War. The new season gives still more traditionally harmless games a murderous twist.</p><p>Before the season gets to the island for the start of the competition, the Salesman merges double-handed Rock, Paper, Scissors with Russian Roulette. After capturing Woo-seok (June Suk-ho) and Mr. Kim (Oh Dal-su), two of the men tasked by Gi-hun to find him, he forces them to each throw out a choice in Rock, Paper, Scissors with each of their hands before taking one choice back and determining the winner based on the final selections. The loser got a gunshot to the temple, with the chance that the hammer could come down on an empty chamber. As we saw, the split-second nature of having to observe what your opponent played and choosing which of your hands to take back led to Mr. Kim acting on instinct alone, instincts that convinced him to spare his younger flunky. </p><p>Later, the season introduced a six-legged pentathlon in which six contestants each tie one of their legs to another’s while moving through a course that has them playing five games—Ddakji, Flying Stone, Gongi, Spinning Top, and Jegi. Outside of Ddakji, the other four were all new additions. But none of those produced heart-wrenching results like the final new game introduced in the second season: Mingle.</p><p>In Mingle, contestants stand on a spinning platform surrounded by a number of open rooms. When the platform stops spinning, the announcer speaks out the number of people that must be grouped together and in one of the rooms by the time the timer stops. Anyone left out of a room when the timer is out gets shot dead, along with contestants in a room with the incorrect number of (alive) players. Alliances are formed and broken within minutes, depending on what is asked of them to survive, and the mad dash to doors turns into contestants physically trying to keep others out of their rooms, effectively killing them. This was the first game of the season that made it abundantly clear to the contestants that teamwork is a survivalist illusion, and saving yourself ultimately will come down to killing others.</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="241b4a62e61865bf19eb65f91ef3c47b" data-recommend-id="image://241b4a62e61865bf19eb65f91ef3c47b" data-format="jpg" data-width="2808" data-height="1872" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Contestants choosing sides" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Contestants choosing sides" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Netflix</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="241b4a62e61865bf19eb65f91ef3c47b" data-recommend-id="image://241b4a62e61865bf19eb65f91ef3c47b" data-format="jpg" data-width="2808" data-height="1872" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Contestants choosing sides" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>Following the death of game creator Oh Il-nam (O Yeong-su) at the end of Season 1, it looks like the head of the games In-ho (Lee Byung-hun) took what he learned from last season and expanded it. In the first season, contestants were only given one opportunity to vote on whether the games should continue or stop without any compensation. While the majority voted for the games to stop, they all returned back to the murder lottery after spending a day in their depressing realities. In true <em>Squid Game</em> fashion, one of the few parts of the competition that had any sort of moral fiber was twisted into another opportunity for those working the game to engineer more competition. </p><p>In the second season, players get to vote on the game’s continuation after every competition. To make the decision even harder, players receive an equal share of the prize money if the majority votes to leave. It grows deadlier the deeper into the competition the contestants go, especially when players wear a patch of their choice. The people who vote to stay typically feel as if more money is the only way to save their lives from the debt that could lead to their deaths. The people who vote to leave believe they’d rather be alive and broke than risk their lives for the hopes of a little more money. Even though their decisions are conflicting, they’re both rooted in survival, which inherently puts anyone voting against their decision in opposition to them living. What results from that is one of the bloodiest group fights in <em>Squid Game</em> history.</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="89cb1e803a43325c65b29183926ca8a5" data-recommend-id="image://89cb1e803a43325c65b29183926ca8a5" data-format="jpg" data-width="6462" data-height="4308" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Squid Game contestant looking serious" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Squid Game contestant looking serious" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Netflix</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="89cb1e803a43325c65b29183926ca8a5" data-recommend-id="image://89cb1e803a43325c65b29183926ca8a5" data-format="jpg" data-width="6462" data-height="4308" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Squid Game contestant looking serious" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>This is either blatant foreshadowing of the next winner in <em>Squid Game</em>, or Netflix is about to venture into a dark place of no return. In this season, Player 222, Kim Jun-hee (Jo Yu-ri), is revealed to be pregnant with the child of fellow contestant Player 333, Myung-gi (Yim Si-wan) after he ghosts her. She’s in the competition because she lost her money due to following Myung-gi’s terrible investment advice. Regardless of why she’s there, she’s officially the first pregnant woman in <em>Squid Game</em> history, which means her death could be unprecedented in the worst way.</p><p>Outside of the young guards who get killed in both seasons, <em>Squid Game</em> has pretty much excluded children from risking their lives. Given that Jun-hee’s pregnancy wasn’t overtly visible, it’s possible the organizers of the game were unaware of her bringing a fetus into a warzone. However, a child’s life being decided by their parent’s desperation is the type of social experiment <em>Squid Game</em> has come to be known for. Luckily she survives Season 2, but that doesn’t mean she or her child are in the clear just yet. </p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="a1663cf64a7f5012f189562f35d72bda" data-recommend-id="image://a1663cf64a7f5012f189562f35d72bda" data-format="png" data-width="1507" data-height="1014" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Gi-hun looking at the opposition" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Gi-hun looking at the opposition" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Netflix</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="a1663cf64a7f5012f189562f35d72bda" data-recommend-id="image://a1663cf64a7f5012f189562f35d72bda" data-format="png" data-width="1507" data-height="1014" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Gi-hun looking at the opposition" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>Gi-hun has had a one-track mindset since winning the 45.6 billion  in the first season of <em>Squid Game</em>: stop the people running the game. His first plan fails after the organizers remove the tracking chip implanted in the molar of one of his teeth meant to guide former police officer Jun-ho (Wi Ha-jun) and his team to the remote island that has eluded him for two years. Well, if you can’t bring them to justice, take them to hell. That, or some version of that mentality, was clearly at play when he staged the first attack on the guards by the contestants.</p><p>He doesn’t only remember the games he played in his first go-around, but also the human dynamics that often had depraved results. Once the contestants’ voting reached its first draw, requiring votes to be cast again the following day, Gi-hun knew those who voted to stay would see bedtime as a golden opportunity to take out dissenters from the other side of the voting aisle. He acknowledged that his plan would require fellow contestants to lose their lives, giving him and his collaborators the chance to play dead themselves before attacking guards coming out check their vital signs.</p><p>Even though his plan led to mass casualties, and was ultimately thwarted by In-ho secretly playing as Player 001, Gi-hun now knows the game’s once-impenetrable fortress has exploitable vulnerabilities. Hopefully his attack destabilized their defenses enough for his cavalry to come in and save the day. </p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="3d087d27b02b47c1488bf60af14dc49b" data-recommend-id="image://3d087d27b02b47c1488bf60af14dc49b" data-format="png" data-width="1384" data-height="947" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Gi-hun looking determined" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Gi-hun looking determined" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Netflix</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="3d087d27b02b47c1488bf60af14dc49b" data-recommend-id="image://3d087d27b02b47c1488bf60af14dc49b" data-format="png" data-width="1384" data-height="947" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Gi-hun looking determined" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>We should’ve seen this coming when show creator Hwang Dong-hyuk told <em>Entertainment Weekly </em>that he envisioned the second and third seasons as one season until he realized there were <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://ew.com/squid-game-creator-split-seasons-2-and-3-too-many-episodes-8763970&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://ew.com/squid-game-creator-split-seasons-2-and-3-too-many-episodes-8763970" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">too many episodes</a></span>. Let me speak for the rest of us binge warriors who have routinely dedicated 30 hours of streaming to watch an entire 30-episode series in one weekend: there can never be too many episodes. As a result, the second season of <em>Squid Game </em>is good, but not as satisfying as the first season, which Dong-hyuk also admits was as far as he originally planned for the story to go. </p><p>The primary issue with the truncated season is that the stakes aren’t high enough for viewing interest to be guaranteed much longer. As of now, the third season will show what ramifications will be levied against players for threatening to kill the organizers, how voting on the game’s continuation will change after the bloodbath, whether Gi-hun’s backup arrives in time, and who ultimately will win the competition. Outside of the mutiny, we’ve experienced these stakes in the first season, but they all felt a bit higher because it was our first time. Plus, <em>Squid Game</em> is less of a mystery-style thriller and more of an action thriller that derives its suspense from us clicking to the next episode and finding out how else this show will depict the survival of the fittest. </p><p>While <em>Squid Game</em>’s third season will arrive sometime in 2025, cutting the final season into two parts wasn’t a smart move. Still, if it helped Dong-hyuk get <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://variety.com/2024/tv/global/squid-game-creator-lost-nine-teeth-season-2-money-1236206385/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://variety.com/2024/tv/global/squid-game-creator-lost-nine-teeth-season-2-money-1236206385/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">more money</a></span> (and lose less teeth), then job well done. See you back on the island.  </p></div></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Yet, in recent years, we’ve seen a trend of animated movies and franchises being remade in live-action (or, sometimes, CGI that’s meant to mimic live action with its realism), like Disney’s <em>The Lion King</em> or Universal’s upcoming<em> </em><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/how-to-train-your-dragon-live-action-trailer-2025-httyd-1851703309&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/how-to-train-your-dragon-live-action-trailer-2025-httyd-1851703309"><em>How To Train Your Dragon</em></a></span>. So you might wonder if Wallace and his silent dog Gromit will ever get a live-action remake. According to the duo’s creator, Nick Park, that ain’t ever happening. </p><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.polygon.com/movies/501986/wallace-gromit-netflix-live-action-disney-remake&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.polygon.com/movies/501986/wallace-gromit-netflix-live-action-disney-remake" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>Polygon </em>talked to Park about the upcoming <em>Wallace &amp; Gromit</em> movie</a></span>, <em>Vengeance Most Fowl, </em>and asked him about the possibility of the duo getting a fancy live-action remake. According to the outlet, his response was quick: </p><p> “Well, it’s quite an easy answer,” said Park. “NOOOOOOOO.” </p><p>Park isn’t against bringing the characters to more platforms and mediums. For example, there have been <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/games/wallace-and-gromits-grand-adventures&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/games/wallace-and-gromits-grand-adventures"><em>Wallace &amp; Gromit </em>video games</a></span>. But when it comes to the big movies and shorts, Park thinks the characters will “always be clay.” </p><p> “I think [the clay] is part of the character, it’s part of their soul to be that medium. It’s what they were born out of and [losing the clay] might take something away. It’s quite hard to define. ‘Thumby and funny’ is the phrase we’ve often used.”</p><p>While <em>Wallace &amp; Gromit</em> won’t be making the leap to live action anytime soon, Disney is continuing to push ahead with its attempts at turning its popular animated features into live-action hits.

Thankfully, we know how to mute players in <em>Marvel Rivals</em> so you don’t have to listen to the white noise of someone’s oscillating fan if you don’t want to.</p><h2 id="h68478"><a id="console"></a>How to mute players on PS5 and Xbox</h2><figure id="" data-id="dc5476381867950c83a43bab6b58adaa" data-recommend-id="image://dc5476381867950c83a43bab6b58adaa" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The Match Settings screen, with the cursor highlighting one teammate's muted voice chat." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="The Match Settings screen, with the cursor highlighting one teammate's muted voice chat." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Marvel Games / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="dc5476381867950c83a43bab6b58adaa" data-recommend-id="image://dc5476381867950c83a43bab6b58adaa" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The Match Settings screen, with the cursor highlighting one teammate's muted voice chat." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p><em>Marvel Rivals</em> makes great use of the many keys on a keyboard, but quite a few functions aren’t included as part of the default controls on PlayStation or Xbox. </p><ul data-type="List" data-style="Bullet"><li>Press the Menu/Options button on your controller during a match.</li><li>Select Settings and you should be taken to the Match Settings tab which lists the players of both teams. If you were messing around with some settings earlier, you might need to manually switch to the Match tab.</li><li><strong>Click on the message or speaker icons to the right of the player names; this will mute the text and voice chat respectively for those players.</strong>&nbsp;</li><li>You can also click the microphone icon next to your name to mute your voice from going through.</li></ul><p>This won’t take too long once you get used to it, but it can still be an awkward thing to do during a match unless you’re waiting to respawn. Fortunately, there’s a shortcut.</p><ul data-type="List" data-style="Bullet"><li>Go to the Settings menu during a match or on the main menu screen.</li><li>Move over to the Controller tab using R1/RB.</li><li>Move to the Communication sub-tab using R2/RT.</li><li>Scroll down until you find the option to remap a button for the Voice Chat Menu. Don’t let the name confuse you, it’s referring to the Match Settings screen.</li><li>Pick a button of your preference to remap this handy shortcut.</li></ul><p>You’ll then be able to immediately go to the Match Settings Screen by pressing that button while playing. If you’re unsure of what to get rid of for it, I recommend remapping it over the Chrono Vision button. Developing a general knowledge and familiarity with the maps will make that ability redundant anyway. Chrono Vision is set to the right Directional Pad/Button by default.</p><h2 id="h68479"><a id="pc"></a>How to mute players on PC</h2><p>Muting a toxic player is a lot faster on the PC version of <em>Marvel Rivals</em>. For starters, you can do it the longer way console players use. That means navigating to Settings, Match Settings, and then choosing who to mute. Who has time for all that though? Any time spent on a menu is time you could be making use of your <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/marvel-rivals-hero-shooter-overwatch-team-attacks-how-1851718182&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/marvel-rivals-hero-shooter-overwatch-team-attacks-how-1851718182">Team-Up abilities</a></span>. Luckily, the PC version already has a default key that leads right where you need to go.</p><p><strong>Press the P key and you’ll find yourself at the Match Settings screen.</strong> Look for the player(s) who are disrupting your play, and click on the message or speaker icons next to their usernames to mute text and voice chat from them. </p><h2 id="h68480"><a id="text"></a>How to disable text chat</h2><figure id="" data-id="df8cea084a8a4996d396ccd6bf5b9fb7" data-recommend-id="image://df8cea084a8a4996d396ccd6bf5b9fb7" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The Social Settings tab, with the cursor hovering over the Chat submenu." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="The Social Settings tab, with the cursor hovering over the Chat submenu." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Marvel Games / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="df8cea084a8a4996d396ccd6bf5b9fb7" data-recommend-id="image://df8cea084a8a4996d396ccd6bf5b9fb7" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The Social Settings tab, with the cursor hovering over the Chat submenu." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Any form of chat is important for Competitive matches, but I won’t judge you for preferring to rely on the Ping system in Quick matches. If you just want to avoid seeing particular types of messages in general, you can filter out what goes through the chat. Simply go to the Settings menu and move over to the Social tab. The Chat submenu allows you to enable or disable the following message types:</p><ul data-type="List" data-style="Bullet"><li>Friend Whisper Messages</li><li>Team Messages</li><li>Event Messages</li><li>Faction Messages</li><li>Spectator Messages</li></ul><p>Curiously, there doesn’t seem to be a way to automatically disable chat from the enemy’s team. The only way to stop seeing trash talk from the opposing side is to individually mute them as we covered above.</p><p>Muting players might feel like a mean thing to do, but it’s worth it if you don’t think it will be a major detriment to the team. And it’s certainly the right thing to do if someone’s being toxic. There is nothing wrong with zoning out during some quick matches and just having fun with your <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/marvel-rivals-hero-shooter-free-skins-ps5-psplus-1851721614&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/marvel-rivals-hero-shooter-free-skins-ps5-psplus-1851721614">free skins</a></span>. Either way, the option to mute players is present for multiple reasons, so don’t feel bad about using it.</p><p>.<br></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

It was a sad ending for a once-popular franchise. But a small indie team’s new game might provide a happy ending after all. </p><p>Announced way back in 2020, <em>Restitched </em>is an upcoming PC game that looks a lot like<em> LittleBigPlanet</em>. It features a stuffed teddy bear as its main character and will let players create new levels and maps to share online via the Steam Workshop. </p><p>Here’s the new trailer for <em>Restitched:</em></p><p>It’s impossible to not notice how similar this game is to Sony’s <em>LittleBigPlanet</em>. According to Trixel Creative, the small team behind the project, they were fans of <em>LBP </em>and many played it years ago. But Trixel Creative claims <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.trixelcreative.com/restitched/press&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.trixelcreative.com/restitched/press" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>Restitched</em></a></span> isn’t just about remaking <em>LBP </em>on PC. </p><p>“Some may think we’re creating <em>Restitched </em>just to bring the same experience to the PC, but that couldn’t be further from the truth,” explained the studio in an <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.trixelcreative.com/restitched/faq&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.trixelcreative.com/restitched/faq" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">FAQ on the game’s website</a></span>. “This genre of gaming is largely unexplored, and we love the concept so much that we think there is room for multiple titles to explore it!”</p><p>“Games like <em>LittleBigPlanet </em>have nurtured many creative minds and offered a way for all ages to realize their imagination,” the FAQ continues. “We aim to make a game that can do the same for PC players, albeit with our own unique innovations. We will always have massive admiration and respect for the genre-pioneer that is <em>LittleBigPlanet</em>, along with its many talented developers.”</p><p>The devs also claim this new game isn’t connected to a fan remake of <em>LittleBigPlanet </em>which was also called “Restitched” that was canceled by Sony lawyers in 2020. However, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.eurogamer.net/inside-the-littlebigplanet-pc-fan-game-sony-shut-down-with-a-cease-and-desist&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/inside-the-littlebigplanet-pc-fan-game-sony-shut-down-with-a-cease-and-desist" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Trixel Creative was the team behind that project</a></span>, too, and exactly how they are separated isn’t made clear on the team’s website. </p><p>When Trixel Creative starting working on <em>Restitched </em>in 2020, the <em>LBP </em>franchise was on life support. Now, four years later, Sony has pulled the plug on <em>LittleBigPlanet</em>, and <em>Restitched </em>could be the closest thing fans get to a full-on sequel. </p><p>There’s still no release date for <em>Restitched </em>and it sounds like the game won’t be arriving on consoles anytime soon. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://store.steampowered.com/app/1361090/Restitched/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1361090/Restitched/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">You can, however, wishlist it on Steam now</a></span>.</p><p> .<br></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
