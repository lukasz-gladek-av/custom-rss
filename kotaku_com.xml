According to the CEO of Infinite Reality, there is “no better name than Napster to disrupt.” “Disrupt what?” you might ask. Well, how about how people consume music in the metaverse?</p><p> “When we think about clients who have audiences — influencers, creators — I think it’s very important that they have a connected space that’s around music and musical communities,” said CEO  John Acunto. “We just don’t see anybody in the streaming space creating spaces for music.”</p><p>The plan is to let musicians and fans create and explore 3D spaces in Napster, which in theory will be a metaverse-like game or program. According to Acunto these spaces will be “crazy environments” that are really “only limited by their imaginations.” The CEO gave the example of a reggae artist creating a beach hangout to listen to his music. Wild. Crazy! How did he come up with such an amazing and innovative idea?!?  </p><p>Before Infinite Reality stepped in and bought Napster, the brand had been owned by many different companies, including Rhapsody and Best Buy. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.theverge.com/2022/5/18/23122179/napster-web3-bought-hivemind-algorand&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/5/18/23122179/napster-web3-bought-hivemind-algorand" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Napster’s last owner was an NFT company</a></span> that wanted to do something with music on the blockchain, but that plan fizzled out.

With danger lurking around every corner and extremely limited resources at your disposal, you’ll want to approach every moment with caution and planning. Before you set off on your journey in <em>Atomfall</em>, here are three tips to keep in mind that can help improve your chances at survival.</p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="197298" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="Live Forever in the Universe of 'New World: Aeternum'" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="108" data-playlist="197298,197284,197260" data-current="197298"><div><p>Live Forever in the Universe of 'New World: Aeternum'</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197298/197298_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197298/197298_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197298/197298_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197298/197298_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"></video></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><h2 id="h7567"><a id=""></a>Customize your experience as you see fit</h2><p><em>Atomfall</em> was created with exploration and immersion in mind, so it avoids spelling too much out for you on its default settings. If you play without any assists, you won’t get objective markers or clearly defined tasks. Instead, you’ll need to suss out things entirely on your own, figuring out where leads are asking you to go by following written clues and your own intuition.</p><figure id="" data-id="a724042b5754c9144eae1670b2547476" data-recommend-id="image://a724042b5754c9144eae1670b2547476" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A screenshot shows difficulty options for Atomfall." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A screenshot shows difficulty options for Atomfall." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Rebellion / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="a724042b5754c9144eae1670b2547476" data-recommend-id="image://a724042b5754c9144eae1670b2547476" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A screenshot shows difficulty options for Atomfall." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>If this doesn’t sound up your alley, that’s totally okay! <strong>You can make the game feel a bit more forgiving by heading into Options &gt; Game &gt; Playstyle and turning on various assists.</strong> You can even set it up so that there are waypoint markers and hints.  This dramatically reduces how much additional work you’ll need to put into figuring out how to navigate Atomfall’s sprawling world.</p><h2 id="h7568"><a id=""></a>Thorough exploration is the key to your success</h2><p>Regardless of how you’ve customized your playstyle, exploration remains among the most significant parts of <em>Atomfall</em>. You’ll need to check every nook and cranny of the post-nuclear English countryside for leads that will direct you to side-quests, helpful crafting materials to improve your survivability, and all-important Training Stimulants and skill manuals to bolster your skill tree.</p><figure id="" data-id="b7160c92e8b56b285eab5114fcb05795" data-recommend-id="image://b7160c92e8b56b285eab5114fcb05795" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A player comes across a Training Stimulant in a dark environment." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A player comes across a Training Stimulant in a dark environment." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Rebellion / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="b7160c92e8b56b285eab5114fcb05795" data-recommend-id="image://b7160c92e8b56b285eab5114fcb05795" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A player comes across a Training Stimulant in a dark environment." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>It’s worth noting that a lot of these things are easy to miss, so thorough observation remains key. Check for spots you can climb over or under to reach hidden rooms, and thoroughly examine every desk, shelf, and box in an area so as not to miss anything. Even just finding a few extra bullets or a piece of food can make all the difference in a game where resources are so scarce. </p><h2 id="h7569"><a id=""></a>Stealth is your friend</h2><p>Ammo is hard to come by in <em>Atomfall</em>, so you’ll spend a lot of time in melee combat. However, this means that facing off against tons of foes at once can be extremely overwhelming. <strong>When you’re trying to conserve ammo (or simply don’t have any), you’ll want to resort to stealth.</strong> Sneaking around an enemy encampment while slowly taking out unsuspecting foes and looting their goodies keeps more ammo in your magazines and more health in your, uh, health bar. </p><figure id="" data-id="6ffc0db114ca364e08998a4abc90f8ed" data-recommend-id="image://6ffc0db114ca364e08998a4abc90f8ed" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The player sneaks up on a robot from a distance." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="The player sneaks up on a robot from a distance." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Rebellion / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="6ffc0db114ca364e08998a4abc90f8ed" data-recommend-id="image://6ffc0db114ca364e08998a4abc90f8ed" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The player sneaks up on a robot from a distance." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>If you’re not prepared with adequate resources when all hell breaks loose, though, just run far away and try again later. There’s no shame in regrouping and taking things slowly in a game designed around tense survival mechanics. Your goal is to live to see another day, after all.</p><hr><p><br><em>Atomfall</em> is available on March 27 for PS5 PS4, Xbox Series X/S, and Windows PCs.   </p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Taking place in an alternate reality following the Windscale nuclear disaster of 1957, this UK-based survival-action experience provides a large open-world experience with plenty to do and see in a radioactive England. Here’s how long it’ll take you to see what <em>Atomfall</em> has to offer.</p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="195891" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="The Week In Games: What’s Coming Out Beyond Alan Wake 2" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="156" data-playlist="195891,195301,194651" data-current="195891"><div><p>The Week In Games: What’s Coming Out Beyond Alan Wake 2</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195891/195891_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195891/195891_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195891/195891_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195891/195891_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/21406.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><h2 id="h2294310"><a id=""></a>How long does it take to finish <em>Atomfall</em>?</h2><p><em>Atomfall</em> is an open-zone game that gives you a lot of freedom in how you approach its narrative. You can follow along with the quests given to you by various NPCs, or you can choose to slaughter everyone in your path and figure things out for yourself. Moreover, the game doesn’t do a lot of hand-holding, so you’ll need to spend a lot of time paying close attention to details,studying your environment to find important items and locations. </p><p>All of this freedom helps make the overall experience of <em>Atomfall</em> fairly unique for each player. As such, each person’s playtime will differ based on how they approach the story and the options available to them. Because choices and ingenuity play such a large part in how long the game can last, it’s somewhat difficult to say exactly how long it will take someone to beat. </p><p>Generally speaking, though, if you’re the kind of person who doesn’t venture too far off the beaten path and plans to just focus on pushing through the narrative beats of the game, <strong>you’re likely to get anywhere from 10-20 hours out of your journey through <em>Atomfall</em></strong>—again, largely depending on which choices you make along the way.</p><figure id="" data-id="b757d9e24cd7a292e322363fae5a1fa3" data-recommend-id="image://b757d9e24cd7a292e322363fae5a1fa3" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The player holds a mine detector while walking through an overgrown wasteland." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="The player holds a mine detector while walking through an overgrown wasteland." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="false" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Rebellion</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="b757d9e24cd7a292e322363fae5a1fa3" data-recommend-id="image://b757d9e24cd7a292e322363fae5a1fa3" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The player holds a mine detector while walking through an overgrown wasteland." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>But, if you’re looking to see and do everything <em>Atomfall</em> has to offer, you’ll be able to squeeze quite a lot more out of this post-apocalyptic outing. Doing as much as possible in a single run can easily score you many, many more hours of gameplay than a strictly narrative-focused outing. And <strong>if you’re looking to grab every trophy/achievement in the game, you’ll need to beat it various times while following different paths</strong>. You’ll even be rewarded for finding a way to complete the game in under five hours!</p><p>There’s a ton of replay value in <em>Atomfall</em>, so you’ll be able to play through it as many times as you’d like while always seeing something new. This choice-driven, post-nuclear survival game is available on March 27 for PS5, PS4, Xbox Series X/S, and Windows PCs. </p><p>.  </p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
