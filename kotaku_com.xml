It was taken from <em>La Isla se las Tentaciones</em>, a show that mirrors the original 2003 <em>Temptation Island </em>premise of bringing couples to an erotic getaway where their romantic bonds and libidinal restraint are put under extreme duress as other beautiful participants attempt to seduce them. That’s how a young man named Montoya found himself  one dark, tropical night on the tragic end of this Faustian arrangement on</p><p>The clip begins with host Sandra Barneda showing him what’s presented as a live feed of his partner Anita smooching in bed with her new lover Manuel before the two turns the lights off, get under the covers, and start engaging in more vigorous extracurriculars.

He tells her it’s over. She cries. More mess ensues, with online viewers trying to retrace the ethical breakdowns like John Madden explaining a five-man pass rush. </p><p>The entire clip is in Spanish, but as many English viewers have pointed out, Montoya’s spirit-shattering collision with reality needs no translation. Such is the raw, exploitative power of reality TV at its most unhinged,  when sheer drama and pure watchability are pursued at all costs.

He explains a sick irony in the fact that his decades of <em>Simpsons</em> voice acting that has been enjoyed by billions of people over the show’s illustrious 36-year run could essentially help train A.I. to replace him.</p><p>“I imagine that soon enough, artificial intelligence will be able to recreate the sounds of the more than 100 voices I created for characters on <em>The Simpsons</em> over almost four decades,” he writes. “It makes me sad to think about it. Not to mention, it seems just plain wrong to steal my likeness or sound—or anyone else’s.”</p><p>He does suggest there are aspects of voice acting that A.I. could possibly make easier. “When I know that a certain line needs a laugh, but I’m not sure how to get one, I’ll try different things. I’ll make a list of eight or nine ways to try it,” he wrote. “The A.I. model may not know what’s funny or what timing is, but it could do a million different takes. And it could be told to do them as I would — and it might be pretty convincing.”</p><p>Even with that slight concession to A.I.’s benefits, he uses his lengthy op-ed to shine light on how nuanced voice acting is, and how it won’t be easy to replicate  without humans. To him, voice acting is more than simply reading lines, it’s a marriage of someone’s voice and their acting abilities. Crying real tears to give life to a character’s sobs; running in place while recording lines for a character who’s running; stuffing a lighter in his mouth to convey the sound of a cigar-chomping character; these are all actions Azaria has implemented to make the characters we love appeal to us on a human level. </p><p>“I’d like to think that no matter how much an A.I. version of Moe or Snake or Chief Wiggum will sound like my voice, something will still be missing—the humanness. There’s so much of who I am that goes into creating a voice. How can the computer conjure all that?”</p><p>The existential threat A.I. poses to actors is why certain regulations were put in place in the <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/business/business-news/sagaftra-ai-provisions-agreement-lawyer-1235869078/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/business/business-news/sagaftra-ai-provisions-agreement-lawyer-1235869078/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">collective bargaining agreement</a></span> (CBA) signed after the writers and actors’ strike of 2023, making actors’ consent a necessity before digital replicas of their voice and likeness are created. Even with these safeguards, however, loopholes still exist where an A.I. model can be trained by using an actor’s performance under certain contractual clauses. </p><p>Azaria’s concern is real, and his fears could be the reality of what we hear and see on our TV screens in the future. I’m sure <em>The Simpsons </em>episode satirizing it all will be amazing.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

And while the water and grass starters Blastoise and Venusaur have gotten a fair amount of love, it’s nothing that matches Charizard. Well, after years of playing second fiddle to Charizard, Blastoise is coming out on top in one way: a rap song about him is going viral.</p><p>Genwunner, a rapper who makes songs about different Pokémon, has a song called “Blastoise!” The song, released back in May of 2024, has a sick beat, is catchy as fuck, and is mostly using the cannon-sporting turtle’s built-in weaponry as a euphemism for what you’re probably thinking. Here’s an animated music video featuring the track on Genwunner’s YouTube page:</p><p>Why is it popping off all of a sudden? Because TikTok has just found the song and started using it to pay tribute to the big blue guy in videos like <em>Pokken Tournament</em> edits, or original animations of him in all his “Big Man” glory. Some of the most popular videos using the song have amassed millions of views and likes. Many fans are using it as a trend to recreate his Rain Dance animation from <em>Pokken</em>, which is <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWXWnBu5upQ&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWXWnBu5upQ" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">a bit of a meme</a></span> in its own right, and fits surprisingly well with the song. Blastoise has swagger and we don’t talk about it enough.</p><p>Genwunner has a similar song about Charizard and Venusaur, yet the turtle’s new anthem is running circles around the other two. Right now, “Blastoise!” has over a million streams on Spotify alone, while the other two have only a fraction of that number. The Charizard and Venusaur squads need to mobilize and rep their boys, but in the meantime, Genwunner seems to be enjoying Blastoise’s success.</p><p>It’s February, so that means we’re just a few short weeks away from Pokémon Day on the 27th, commemorating the release date of the original <em>Pokémon Red </em>and <em>Green</em> in 1996. The Pokémon Company hasn’t made an official announcement yet, but the day is usually accompanied by a Pokémon Direct stream showcasing upcoming projects: hopefully this year we’ll get a proper look at the upcoming <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/pokemon-legends-z-a-predictions-mega-evolution-kalos-1851316456&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-legends-z-a-predictions-mega-evolution-kalos-1851316456"><em>Pokémon Legends: Z-A</em></a></span>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
