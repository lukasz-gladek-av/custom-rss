              <p>Activision and Treyarch are making a big change to <a href="https://kotaku.com/gamescom-onl-opening-night-live-call-of-duty-black-ops-7-trailer-2000618479"><em>Call of Duty: Black Ops 7</em></a>, just under 12 weeks before its launch in November. All those wacky cosmetics from <em>Black Ops 6</em> will no longer carry over to the new sequel as previously promised. The devs behind <em>Call of Duty</em> say the change is to ensure <em>Black Ops 7</em> is ‚Äúauthentic to <em>Call of Duty</em> and its setting.‚Äù</p> <p><a href="https://www.callofduty.com/blog/2025/08/call-of-duty-community-update-august-2025">On August 26</a>, in a lengthy community update posted on the official <em>Call of Duty</em> website, Treyarch thanked fans for all the feedback and acknowledged the ongoing conversation online surrounding crossover skins and wacky cosmetic items in video games.</p> <p>‚ÄúWe know there‚Äôs been a lot of conversation recently about the identity of <em>Call of Duty,</em>‚Äù said the studio. ‚ÄúSome of you have said we‚Äôve drifted from what made <em>Call of Duty</em> unique in the first place: immersive, intense, visceral and in many ways grounded. That feedback hits home, and we take it seriously. We hear you.‚Äù</p>

 <p><iframe loading="lazy" title="COD x Beavis &amp; Butt-Head | Call of Duty: Warzone &amp; Black Ops 6" width="500" height="281" src="about:blank" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen="" data-rocket-lazyload="fitvidscompatible" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/gjaKA57mnu8?feature=oembed"></iframe></p> <p>Players were worried that the weird cosmetics and crossover skins from <em>Black Ops 6</em> would immediately turn<em> Black Ops 7</em> into a <em>Fortnite</em>-like experience. That‚Äôs because the plan was to let skins from <em>BLOPS 6, </em>which now includes characters like Beavis and Butt-Head, carry over to <em>BLOPS 7</em>. But that‚Äôs no longer happening.</p> <p>‚ÄúOperators, Operator Skins, and Weapons from <em>Black Ops 6</em> will no longer carry forward into Black Ops 7,‚Äù announced Treyarch. <em>‚ÄúBlack Ops 7</em> needs to feel authentic to Call of Duty and its setting. That is why<em> Black Ops 6</em> Operator and Weapon content will not carry forward to <em>Black Ops 7.</em> Double XP tokens and GobbleGums will still carry forward, because we recognize your time and progression are important.‚Äù</p> <p>The developers of <em>Black Ops 7</em> also claimed that a ‚Äúton of feedback‚Äù has already been implemented into the game. And the studio explained that future cosmetic bundles and items added to <em>BLOPS 7</em> will be ‚Äúcrafted to fit the <em>Black Ops</em> identity.‚Äù Treyarch further added: ‚ÄúWe hear the feedback. We need to deliver a better balance toward the immersive, core <em>Call of Duty</em> experience.‚Äù</p> <p>Activision did confirm that <em>BLOPS 6</em> skins will still move over to <em>Warzone</em>. So your strange collection of characters can still go enjoy battle royale.</p>

              <p>Electronic Arts and developers Full Circle announced that <a href="https://kotaku.com/ea-skate-4-reboot-release-date-early-access-2025-pc-ps5-1851650367">after years of waiting</a> and fans begging for a new game, the upcoming <em>Skate</em> reboot will launch in September in early access on consoles and PC.</p> <p><a href="https://x.com/skate/status/1960371890570023372">On August 26</a>, EA posted a short trailer for the next <em>Skate</em> game, which is confusingly just titled <em>Skate</em>, and finally confirmed an early access release date. Previously, the publisher had teased that it would be out sometime this year and later promised it would be out this summer. But now we know that the new, online-only <em>Skate</em> reboot is launching on September 16. Mark your calendars and set aside some time to kickflip. Or crash. You‚Äôll probably be crashing a lot.&nbsp; Here‚Äôs the new trailer:</p> <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">We are so hyped to announce that skate. will release in Early Access September 16th, 2025. See you in San Vansterdam! üõπ <a href="https://t.co/3tR3onovwb">pic.twitter.com/3tR3onovwb</a></p> <p>‚Äî skate. (@skate) <a href="https://twitter.com/skate/status/1960371890570023372?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">August 26, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <p>This new <em>Skate</em> reboot will be an online-only multiplayer-focused open-world adventure <a href="https://kotaku.com/skate-4-reboot-ea-servers-150-players-100-songs-seasons-summer-2000618257">featuring over 100 songs and up to 150 players</a> skating together in a single session. The game is set in San Vansterdam, a city built from the ground up by EA and Open Circle to be the dream playground for all skateboarders.</p> <p>It‚Äôs been a long wait for this new <em>Skate</em> game. <a href="https://kotaku.com/ea-has-finally-announced-a-new-skate-game-1844087679">EA first revealed it was working on a new <em>Skate</em> in 2020</a> after years of fans begging them to make it. Since then, the game has been <a href="https://kotaku.com/skate-4-ea-leaked-alpha-beta-build-pc-devs-1849176399">leaked a few times</a>, and EA has put out early, unfinished footage of <em>Skate</em> as part of a plan to be more transparent about the open-world skateboarding game‚Äôs development. <em>Skate</em> has also been playtested by fans in the lead-up to its launch. The new <em>Skate</em> arrives on PS5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC on September 16.</p>
