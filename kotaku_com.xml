              <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/wordle-new-york-times-crosswords-josh-wardle-app-ios-an-1848455748"><i><span>Wordle</span></i></a><span>, the word-guessing game that has been a daily fixture in </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/new-pope-american-leo-wordle-words-with-friends-gamer-1851779977"><span>many people’s lives</span></a><span> since 2021, had a more difficult word than usual today, December 19. I don’t play </span><i><span>Wordle</span></i><span>, so I didn’t think much of it when my coworkers were chatting about how tough today’s word was. That is, until I looked outside of the </span><i><span>Kotaku </span></i><span>Slack and to the rest of the internet, where I saw that </span><i><span>Wordle</span></i><span> players were absolutely crashing out about today’s word.&nbsp;</span></p>  <p><span>The word for today is “myrrh,” which, for those who don’t know about the cool shit Jesus was given when he died, is a “fragrant gum resin obtained from various Arabian and African trees and used in perfumery, medicines, and incense.” For a lot of players, the go-to </span><i><span>Wordle</span></i><span> strategy is to start by guessing vowels as a basis and then filling in consonants based on where the vowels fall. As you can see, myrrh has no vowels, so players were already at a disadvantage. Many tried and failed to figure out the word, and it just about ruined their day.</span></p>

   <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">playing today's wordle and there's no vowels <a href="https://t.co/zyq9l37IuP">pic.twitter.com/zyq9l37IuP</a></p> <p>— Ace♡ (@trashwoman_ace) <a href="https://twitter.com/trashwoman_ace/status/2001894340810182825?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 19, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">how people gonna be talking about today's wordle <a href="https://t.co/KhgqsrP8Ce">pic.twitter.com/KhgqsrP8Ce</a></p> <p>— DD | Major (@MajorSSB) <a href="https://twitter.com/MajorSSB/status/2001932790154301497?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 19, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">Guys please trust me and go play the wordle right now it is actually the hardest wordle ever made, what the fuck was that</p> <p>— chloechu 💞 (@imchloechu) <a href="https://twitter.com/imchloechu/status/2001793461662441473?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 18, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">If you're having a good day today, don't play wordle</p> <p>— Marques Brownlee (@MKBHD) <a href="https://twitter.com/MKBHD/status/2002080868207386827?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 19, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">Wordle today for no reason <a href="https://t.co/Tzukl5q8Ns">pic.twitter.com/Tzukl5q8Ns</a></p> <p>— Enten 🂡 (@WielderOfEnten) <a href="https://twitter.com/WielderOfEnten/status/2002017970214572456?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 19, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <p><span>These are just a few of the social media reactions I saw, as they were the most tame. What I wasn’t expecting was some of the other responses I came across that we elected not to share here. I know edgy humor and wild comparisons are common in most gaming spheres, but I did not expect some of the vile shit I saw </span><i><span>Wordle </span></i><span>players calling the game’s developers. So if you’re down to see some truly off-the-wall, excessive reactions to a simple word game, you can search for that yourself.</span></p>

 <p><span>At any rate, maybe they’ll bring “myrrh” back to </span><i><span>Wordle </span></i><span>when </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/wordle-jimmy-fallon-game-show-host-nbc-savannah-guthrie-2000632667"><span>Jimmy Fallon’s game show</span></a><span> version comes along, and we’ll see someone crash out on live television.</span></p>

            <title><![CDATA[Switch 2 Dev Explains Why It’s Ditching Game Key Cards Thanks To Nintendo]]></title>
            <link>https://kotaku.com/switch-2-dev-explains-why-its-ditching-game-key-cards-thanks-to-nintendo-2000654878</link>
            <guid>1388674</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>In a promising reversal for <a href="https://kotaku.com/nintendo-pokemon-pokopia-game-key-card-2000642940">game key card haters</a> everywhere,<em> R-Type Dimensions 3</em> publisher Inin Games has announced it will be able to support a physical release on Switch 2 that contains the entire game on the cartridge. How was it able to manage this feat? It said this was all thanks to Nintendo introducing additional SD card sizes for Switch 2, before later revoking all such claims.</p> <p>“We’re happy to share a positive update regarding the Nintendo Switch 2 version of <em>R-Type Dimensions 3</em>,” the company <a href="https://iningames.com/blogs/news/update-on-the-nintendo-switch-2-physical-release-of-r-type-dimensions-iii">announced on Friday</a>. “There is no better timing: Two days ago Nintendo announced two new smaller cartridge sizes for Nintendo Switch 2. This allows us to recalculate production in a way that in a way that wasn’t possible before.”</p>

 <p>As a result, it said it would move forward with offering a physical version of the game on Switch 2 that wasn’t a game key card. The only difference is that the physical version will cost $10 more than the digital version to account for the production costs. This is good news, and essentially what every diehard fan and enthusiast collector has been begging Nintendo and its Switch 2 development partners to do from the start.</p>

 <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">ININ Games retracts their statement about the new smaller Switch 2 carts. </p> <p>"There has been no official announcement or confirmation from Nintendo concerning cartridge storage capacities. Any references to specific storage sizes should not be interpreted as official information… <a href="https://t.co/V9yeCHynVR">pic.twitter.com/V9yeCHynVR</a></p> <p>— Wario64 (@Wario64) <a href="https://twitter.com/Wario64/status/2002067728631533570?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 19, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <p>But apparently Inin Games wasn’t supposed to reveal that this was all due to new cartridge sizes from Nintendo. The company deleted its original statement and followed up with a bizarre new one. “There has been no official announcement or confirmation from Nintendo concerning cartridge storage capacities,” the company corrected itself.</p>

 <p>It continued, “Any references to specific storage sizes should not be interpreted as official information from Nintendo. At this time, we can only confirm that our upcoming release <em>R-Type Dimensions III</em> will be on a physical cartridge. No further technical details regarding cartridge specifications have been officially confirmed.” Mmhmm. Sure.</p>

 <p>The good news is that it sounds like other publishers may be able to take advantage of this new development moving forward, though some may still opt to do game key cards for performance reasons (running a game off an installation vs. a cartridge can improve loading times) or because of the cost savings. Up until now, the only Switch 2 cartridges available to developers were 64GB ones.</p>

 <p>Games that were too big, like<em> Final Fantasy VII Remake</em>, had to go the game key card route as a result. But it also meant that most small games found paying for the unneeded extra space prohibitively expensive. <em>Final Fantasy Tactics: The Ivalice Chronicles</em> and a ton of other games were only released on Switch 2 as game key cards as a result. Hopefully, Square Enix and others follow the example now set by <em> R-Type Dimensions 3</em><em>.&nbsp;</em></p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/modretro-anduril-chromatic-attack-drone-metal-luckey-2000654868</link>
            <guid>1388596</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><span>ModRetro, a company that makes </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/m64-mario-kart-modretro-palmer-luckey-nintendo-64-1851786895"><span>retro handhelds and consoles that play older games</span></a><span> and that’s run by Oculus founder Palmer Luckey, has announced a new Chromatic device it’s making in collaboration with Luckey’s other professional endeavor: defense tech company Anduril Industries. The limited-edition handheld’s big selling point is that it’s made from the same metal Anduril uses to create its attack drones. Gross.</span></p> <p><span>The $349.99 </span><a href="https://modretro.com/products/anduril-chromatic-porta-pro-bundle"><span>Anduril Chromatic + Porta Pro Bundle</span></a><span> includes the handheld, headphones, and a charm of Anduril’s logo. The listing says that the device is made from the “same magnesium aluminum alloy as Anduril’s attack drones” and that if you’re looking for a retro gaming system that offers “performance and reliability under any and all conditions, there is no other option.” What kind of combat zone does ModRetro think people are playing </span><i><span>Tetris</span></i><span> in that they need something military-grade to play their games on?</span></p>

 <p><span>While we can speculate about what kind of environment someone might play a retro handheld gaming system in, this is ultimately the latest effort from a glorified arms dealer responsible for making weapons used in acts of war to cozy up to the retro gaming community. The video game industry and the military-industrial complex have long been deeply connected in ways too numerous to count, joining forces to use </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/u-s-army-call-duty-twitch-ign-g4-swagg-stonemountain64-1849844389"><span>games and live-streaming platforms to try to increase military recruitment</span></a><span> among Gen Z, but there is something particularly gross and fetishistic about selling people a Game Boy knock-off that is made to be as durable as an attack drone.</span></p>

              <p>2025 has been the most incredible year for indie gaming. Rather than one ultra-standout game, like last year’s <em>Balatro&nbsp;</em>(<a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2379780/Balatro/">15 percent off</a>), we’ve been treated to a wide array of small-team, small-budget creations that have broken through to wider attention. And right now, nearly all of them are available at a decent discount in Steam’s Winter Sale.</p> <p>This is not a comprehensive list—like I said, it’s been an incredible year—and I want to make room for enormously accomplished games that haven’t had quite so much attention too. (Oh, and you won’t find that multi-million dollar game developed by hundreds of people here, even though all the so-called “indie” awards have abandoned all meaning and sense and allowed one such game to unfairly dominate attention and accolades.) Every one of these games is well worth your attention over the Christmas break, and now you don’t have to pay as much.</p>

 <hr> <h2><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3527290/PEAK/">Peak</a></h2>  <p>Every year seems to have an indie climbing hit, and this year it’s the <a href="https://kotaku.com/peak-steam-reviews-lethal-company-aggro-crab-1851786254">wonderful&nbsp;<em>Peak</em></a>. Ideally played in co-op, you and some buddies attempt to climb a mountain with the constant risk of making a mistake and pulling all your friends into disaster. And earlier this year <a href="https://kotaku.com/peak-cannibalism-patch-notes-bug-fixes-steam-1851787299">it added cannibalism</a>!</p>

 <p><em>Peak</em> is currently 38 percent off, making it only <strong>$5</strong>.</p> <hr> <h2><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2419670/Eclipsium/">Eclipsium</a></h2>  <p>One of the most striking and astonishing games in 2025,&nbsp;<em>Eclipsium</em> takes the walking simulator and turns it into a breathtaking work of horror and surrealism, with artwork like nothing else that’s ever existed. I spoke to the developer about how it was created <a href="https://buried-treasure.org/2025/10/eclipsium/">here</a>. At 20 percent off, it’s yours this holiday for just <strong>$10</strong>.</p>

 <hr> <h2><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1904480/Absolum/">Absolum</a></h2>  <p>One of the most popular indie games of 2025, roguelite beat ’em up&nbsp;<em>Absolum</em> is absolutely drowning in <a href="https://kotaku.com/absolum-review-streets-of-rage-4-impressions-beat-em-up-2000633646">incredible reviews</a>. It comes from the same team that brought us 2020’s <em>Streets of Rage 4</em>&nbsp;(<a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/985890/Streets_of_Rage_4/">65 percent off</a>), and likely would have scooped a bunch of awards this year if a certain other game hadn’t stolen them. Its already bargain price is now 20 percent lower, at <strong>$20</strong>.</p>

 <hr> <h2><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3405340/Megabonk/">Megabonk</a></h2>  <p>No one really knows for sure who developer Vedinad is, but it’s certainly very suspicious that the name spells “Danidev” backwards, which just happens to be the name of a YouTuber and developer who <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHMClFWa-fA&amp;t=381s">famously vanished</a> a few years back. Anyway, whoever they may be, they <a href="https://kotaku.com/megabonk-dev-officially-withdraws-it-from-the-game-awards-2000645270">had the integrity to withdraw</a> <em>Megabonk</em>, their fantastic 3D reimagining of <em>Vampire Survivors</em>, from contention for Best Debut Indie Game in this year’s Game Awards, on the basis that it’s not their debut game. (DaniDev made&nbsp;<a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1782210/Crab_Game/"><em>Crab Game</em></a>). Anyway, it’s brilliant, it’s ludicrously moreish, and now it’s 25 percent cheaper at just <strong>$7.49</strong>.</p>

 <hr> <h2>Urban Myth Dissolution Center</h2>  <p>Pixel horror visual novel&nbsp;<em>Urban Myth Dissolution Center&nbsp;</em>came out all the way back in February, and as such hasn’t been all that well remembered in end-of-year lists. So put that right! You’re investigating supernatural cases, untangling conspiracies, and collecting evidence, in order to bring about the dissolution of, well, urban myths. A 15 percent discount brings it down to just <strong>$15</strong>.</p>

 <hr> <h2><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1395520/The_Sance_of_Blake_Manor/">The Séance of Blake Manor</a></h2>  <p>Well, this one certainly hasn’t suffered for attention! A massive breakthrough hit, <em>The Séance of Blake Manor</em> is a 19th-century supernatural detective game in which you investigate the spooky disappearance of Evelyn Deane. Is it 2025’s <em>The </em><em>Case of the Golden Idol</em>? Yeah, that sounds about right. And despite only coming out less than two months ago, it’s already offering a 25 percent discount, making it now <strong>$15</strong> for the holidays.</p> <hr> <h2><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2721890/oo/">Öoo</a></h2>  <p>One of my absolutely favorite games of 2025, <em>Öoo</em> is a game about using bombs to explore a puzzle platform world. It’s called <em>Öoo</em> because you’re little round blob dude who can drop two bombs at a time, and that spells “ooo.” It’s so damned smart, with constantly innovative puzzles, a so-called <a href="https://thinkygames.com/features/metroidbrainia-an-in-depth-exploration-of-knowledge-gated-games/">metroidbrania</a> in which progress is only gated by ideas you haven’t had yet. It’s sublime, and now super cheap, discounted 20 percent to <strong>$8</strong>.</p> <hr>  <h2><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1170570/The_Drifter/">The Drifter</a></h2>  <p>Another game that I’m delighted to say has received a huge amount of attention this year,&nbsp;<em>The Drifter</em> is one of the best point-and-click adventures of 2025, and that’s facing strong competition. This tale of an Australian itinerant returning to his home town for his mother’s funeral is a compelling mystery and stunningly put together. Its ending is…silly, but it’s a brilliant time. It’s 15 percent off, yours for <strong>$17</strong>.</p>

 <hr> <h2>Old Skies</h2>  <p>Talking of stunning point-and-click adventures from this year, there’s also the incredible&nbsp;<em>Old Skies</em>. From stalwart adventure creator Wadjet Eye, this follow-up to&nbsp;<em>Unavowed</em> tells the tale of a time-travelling agent, Fia Quinn, taking clients on “vacations” to points in the past, with its episodic story slowly weaving itself into a larger conspiracy. It’s superb stuff, now down 20 percent to&nbsp;<strong>$16</strong>.</p> <hr> <h2><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2367820/despelote/">Despelote</a></h2>  <p>Here’s why I love video games: One of the most well-respected and well-loved video games of 2025 is an exploration of the love of soccer as it was felt in Quito, Ecuador in 2001. And it obviously goes far deeper than that, telling a semi-autobiographical story that allows you a window into one kid’s world in a way only video games can offer. Incredible, moving stuff. It’s down a hefty 35 percent, now under <strong>$10</strong>.</p>

 <hr> <h2><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2000120/Time_Flies/">Time Flies</a></h2>  <p>Mario von Rickenbach has been making fantastically interesting games as Playables for many years, each a minimalist experiment in art and interaction. The likes of&nbsp;<em>Kids</em>,&nbsp;<em>Plug &amp; Play</em>, <em>My Exercise </em>and&nbsp;<em>Cars</em> have all been joyful, but failed to get wider attention.&nbsp;<em>Time Flies</em> appears to be the well-deserved breakthrough, a slightly more game-like game in which you play as a fly trying to achieve all the items on a bucket list before its brief life is over. It’s an interactive toy, a wonderful piece of animation, and just all-round amazing entertainment. 35 percent off, it’s now <strong>$10</strong>.</p>
