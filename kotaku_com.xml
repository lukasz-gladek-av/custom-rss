              <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/perfect-dark-xbox-showcase-gameplay-1851528864"><em>Perfect Dark</em></a> was one of the most anticipated blockbusters in the first-party Xbox portfolio when it was <a href="https://kotaku.com/xbox-reportedly-cancels-that-cool-looking-perfect-dark-1851785531">suddenly canceled</a> earlier this summer amid mass cuts at Microsoft. <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-09-02/-perfect-dark-developer-lays-off-staff-after-funding-deal-falls-through?accessToken=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJzb3VyY2UiOiJTdWJzY3JpYmVyR2lmdGVkQXJ0aWNsZSIsImlhdCI6MTc1NjgzNDY3OSwiZXhwIjoxNzU3NDM5NDc5LCJhcnRpY2xlSWQiOiJUMVoyQTRHUTdMRlEwMCIsImJjb25uZWN0SWQiOiJCMUVBQkI5NjQ2QUM0REZFQTJBRkI4MjI1MzgyQTJFQSJ9.iGoAomXADlAaCsr4KgsTEy8oHTbv4k9XTSl7NVtRZXo&amp;leadSource=uverify%20wall"><em>Bloomberg</em> now reports</a> there was briefly an attempt to find the troubled game a new publisher so that it could still come out.</p> <p>Unfortunately, those talks apparently fell through, at least in part due to disagreements over IP rights. The idea was that Embracer-owned Crystal Dynamics, which was co-developing the stealth shooter <a href="https://kotaku.com/xbox-perfect-dark-halo-gears-war-fable-ps5-1851785732">with now defunct Xbox studio The Initiative</a>, would complete the project under a new publishing deal with Take-Two. The two companies reportedly came “close” to a deal but one of the things that ultimately sunk talks was disagreement over who would own the <em>Perfect Dark</em> franchise, which currently belongs to Microsoft, over the long term.</p> <p>If <em>Perfect Dark</em> had been a success, the IP rights would have become way more valuable overnight with the potential for sequels or TV and movie adaptations. But for that to happen it would have had to come out. How much will the IP be worth with no new game in over 15 years?</p>

 <p>This deal falling through is seemingly why Crystal Dynamics announced new layoffs last week. “This decision was not made lightly,” the studio <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7366524687985594369/">posted on LinkedIn</a>. “It was necessary, however, to ensure the long-term health of our studio and core creative priorities in a continually shifting market.”</p> <p>Microsoft has found a way to give some of the casualties of its mass layoffs a second lease on life. <em>Hi-Fi Rush</em> maker Tango Gameworks briefly shutdown in 2024 before <a href="https://kotaku.com/tango-gameworks-hi-fi-rush-revive-shutdown-krafton-xbox-1851619190">being resurrected</a> later that year under South Korean publisher Krafton. It’s a shame the tech giant couldn’t find a way to make that happen for <em>Perfect Dar</em>k, both for fans but most of all for the people who were working on it.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><span>It feels like just yesterday that </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/kpop-demon-hunters-best-worst-songs-soundtrack-ranking-2000616633"><i><span>KPop Demon Hunters</span></i></a> <span>was only on my radar because the internet was memeing the hell out of one of the musical’s early scenes in which Huntr/x, the fictional girl group that would give Dante from </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/devil-may-cry-netflix-review-season-1-dante-lady-vergil-1851774417"><i><span>Devil May Cry</span></i></a> <span>a run for his money on the demon-slaying front, devours their pre-show snacks in a way that can only be described as bestial. If I had listened to the dismissive jokes, I might have thought the movie was just some goofy animated slop in Netflix’s never-ending content mill and passed on loading it up to see what all the fuss was about. However, even if I hadn’t taken the plunge, </span><i><span>KPop Demon Hunters </span></i><span>would have become a phenomenon too big to ignore. In the two months since the movie launched on Netflix’s streaming service, the movie Sony was too cautious to release in theaters on its own has become arguably one of the most important moments in pop culture this year. How did we get here? What can we learn from the movie’s resounding success? Given how well the first movie has performed for Netflix, is there any need for the inevitable sequel to do anything differently?&nbsp;</span></p> <p><i><span>KPop Demon Hunters</span></i><span>’ success can be attributed to a few factors, but all of it leads back to it having every advantage in a world where it’s increasingly imperative that a project achieve viral recognition and good word of mouth. Launching on Netflix was undeniably a boon for the film, as kids love to watch movies on repeat, and if an audience readily has easier access to something at home, it feeds The Content Machine. YouTubers can create entire reaction videos from the comfort of their own homes, clips that aren’t just grainy camera recordings in a dark theater can circulate on social media, and its soundtrack of catchy K-pop earworms can be available on streaming the day the movie comes out. Even if its title and premise didn’t grab your attention, </span><i><span>KPop Demon Hunters </span></i><span>was uniquely positioned to find its audience, and that audience is historically very loud.</span></p> <figure id="attachment_2000618423" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000618423"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000618423">© Netflix</figcaption></figure> <p><span>The K-pop audience is merely one slice of the pie, however. </span><i><span>KPop Demon Hunters</span></i><span>’ stunning </span><i><span>Spider-Verse</span></i><span>-esque animation, anime-inspired action, and Disney-like musicality means that even if the core premise doesn’t appeal to you, the movie probably has something that will catch your eye. As specific as its audience appears on the surface, the film isn’t just gunning for the biggest Twice stan with a Netflix subscription. Casual K-Pop listeners like myself found a lot to love in the film’s story of self-acceptance punctuated by some absolute bangers. The end result is something that transcends K-pop fandom and has rooted itself in the hearts and minds of audiences worldwide.</span></p>

 <p><i><span>KPop Demon Hunters </span></i><span>is a chart-topping success story on multiple fronts. It’s now Netflix’s </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/kpop-demon-hunters-most-popular-netflix-streaming-2000620409"><span>most-watched film of all time</span></a><span>; </span><a href="https://www.the-numbers.com/movie/KPop-Demon-Hunters-(2025)#tab=summary"><span>topped the box office</span></a><span> with limited </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/kpop-demon-hunters-singalong-box-office-showtimes-songs-2000620026"><span>singalong screenings</span></a><span> that the AMC theater chain </span><a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/pop-culture/pop-culture-news/kpop-demon-hunters-gives-netflix-first-box-office-win-rcna226872"><span>didn’t even participate in</span></a><span> its self-love anthem, “Golden,” has </span><a href="https://www.billboard.com/music/chart-beat/huntrx-golden-global-charts-number-one-sixth-week-1236051236/"><span>been at the top of the Billboard top 200 for weeks</span></a><span>; and the movie’s soundtrack is the first to have </span><a href="https://www.the-independent.com/arts-entertainment/music/news/kpop-demon-hunters-soundtrack-charts-golden-lyrics-singalong-b2813992.html"><span>four songs in Billboard’s top 10 at once</span></a><span>. All of this success with a movie for which Sony made the “safe” choice to have Netflix foot the production bill in exchange for </span><a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/movies/movie-news/kpop-demon-hunters-sony-netflix-sequel-talks-1236353972/"><span>exclusive streaming rights</span></a><span> and a split revenue in soundtrack sales. While some, myself included, have called Sony’s decision foolish, given the movie has done nothing but thrive since it arrived on Netflix, there is part of me that wonders if Huntr/x would have become a household name were </span><i><span>KPop Demon Hunters </span></i><span>not so easily accessible. So much of its spread has been because it is easily clippable, screenshotable, and shareable across social media like TikTok and YouTube. Sony’s hesitation to put the movie in theaters may have been what led to it becoming the viral hit it has.</span></p> <figure id="attachment_2000620410" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000620410"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000620410">© Netflix</figcaption></figure> <p><span>But what is the source of that hesitation? Is it because someone up top thought K-pop was too niche, or the mix of genres was too off-putting? Or is it just that </span><i><span>KPop Demon Hunters </span></i><span>was a new property led by women? The film</span> <span>is the latest example of women-led cinema doing huge numbers, and then the rest of the world acting surprised that something ostensibly targeting young girls has an audience. The </span><i><span>Barbie </span></i><span>movie made over a billion dollars, the </span><i><span>Frozen </span></i><span>movies are some of the most successful animated films of all time, and we still need astronomical success stories to convince us that there’s demand for women-led films. </span><i><span>KPop Demon Hunters </span></i><span>is breaking through multiple ceilings both for its own success and to pave the way for others, but only time will tell if anyone actually learns anything from this, or if the film industry’s goldfish brain kicks in again and we forget until the sequel rolls out in a few years.</span></p>

              <p>Just ten years back, it’d be tough to imagine Disney being willing to put its name to something as outstandingly gory as <em>Marvel: Rivals</em>. The new trailer reveals some incredibly gloopy deaths, outlandish violence, and blood absolutely everywhere. It’s surely one of the goriest things Disney has ever made? The show will also feature the voices of big-time Hollywood names like Paul Rudd, Florence Pugh, Elizabeth Olsen and Awkwafina.</p> <p>It’s Disney’s rush of acquisitions that mostly seems to have contributed to the once prim company now releasing some very adult content. Buying Marvel and Fox meant the not so family-friendly <em>X-Men</em> movies arrived on streaming platform Disney+, and the two combined in spectacular fashion in the&nbsp;<em>Deadpool</em> movies. It’s quite something that such films appear alongside the gallery of princesses on the subscription service. Now add <em>Marvel Zombies</em> to that discombobulation, because damn, this trailer has all the gore.</p>  <p>I had no expectations for this. The&nbsp;<em>What If…</em> series has mostly left me very flat, but <em>What If… Zombies?!</em> has inspired a whole new miniseries, due to be added to the streamer September 24, and this trailer has me absolutely in.</p>

 <p>It helps that the voice cast is absolutely incredible. <em>What If…</em> occasionally got the movie actors, but often not–this time, though, it’s a stunning collection. As you’ll hear in the trailer there’s Florence Pugh revising her <em>Thunderbolts*</em> role as Yelena Belova, along with David Harbour as her father, Alexei Shostakov. But there’s also Paul Rudd as Ant-Man, Awkwafina as Xu Shang-Chi’s bestie Katy, Elizabeth Olson as Scarlet Witch (naturally a zombie), Wyatt Russell as the unimprovably named John Walker, Tessa Thompson as <em>Thor</em>‘s Valkyrie, and Iman Vellani as Kamala Khan. And that’s barely half the list.</p> <p>The whole thing is obviously entirely non-canon for the MCU, rather offering a chance to let the characters behave in ways they otherwise never could, in circumstances that Disney would <em>never</em> let reach the big screen. Or would they? I mean,&nbsp;<em>Deadpool</em> got to keep going! Maybe one day.</p> <p>The trailer’s highlight for me? Definitely Spider-Man (still voiced by Hudson Thames as in previous animated series) taking the heads of so many zombs at once. Very not Peter Parker-like behavior.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Last year, Sony released a new PS5 Dualsense controller themed around the then-upcoming platformer <em><a href="https://kotaku.com/astro-bot-kotaku-review-playstation-5-1851640280">Astro Bot</a>.</em> The game was a huge hit with critics and fans, as was the controller, which sold out quickly and became hard to find. But now, a slightly tweaked version of the popular gamepad is returning in October with pre-orders later this month.</p> <p><a href="https://x.com/PlayStation/status/1962908501270827092">On September 2</a>, <a href="https://kotaku.com/astro-bot-five-new-free-levels-july-10-cameo-bots-ps5-1851786014">after some teasing in July,</a> PlayStation revealed that the new “Joyful” version of the<em> Astro Bot</em> PS5 controller was officially launching just before Halloween, on October 30. And gamers who missed out on buying an <a href="https://kotaku.com/astro-bot-ps5-sony-parappa-1851653602"><em>Astro Bot</em></a> controller last year will have a chance to pre-order the new version on September 12 at 10 a.m. local time via PlayStation’s own online store and “participating retailers.”</p> <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">Astro Bot returns with a new delightful twist! </p> <p>The limited edition Astro Bot Joyful DualSense launches October 30. Pre-orders start September 12 at 10am local time at <a href="https://t.co/y9oEB5a3CG">https://t.co/y9oEB5a3CG</a> and participating retailers. <a href="https://t.co/TLqJEyEZSt">pic.twitter.com/TLqJEyEZSt</a></p> <p>— PlayStation (@PlayStation) <a href="https://twitter.com/PlayStation/status/1962908501270827092?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">September 2, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <p>This isn’t the same controller that was sold back in 2024 and <a href="https://www.thegamer.com/astro-bot-ps5-dualsense-controllers-are-being-scalped-for-over-150-second-hand-market-exclusive-items/">quickly gobbled up and scalped on eBay</a> for more than twice the price. Well, it’s mostly the same controller. The only real difference is the touchpad. On the <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2024/07/29/first-look-astro-bot-limited-edition-dualsense-wireless-controller/">OG <em>Astro Bot</em> gamepad</a>, the eyes were open and always watching you play. This time around, the eyes are slightly closed, simulating joy and happiness. <a href="https://kotaku.com/ps5-limited-edition-dualsense-astro-bot-pre-order-1851607894">It’s a bit less creepy, which is nice</a>.</p>

 <p>No price was shared for this new version of the controller, but last time PlayStation sold the <em>Astro Bot</em> Dualsense controller, it was priced at $80. Still, the new<em> Astro Bot</em> pad might cost a bit more. <a href="https://kotaku.com/new-ps5-controller-last-of-us-dualsense-ugly-price-sony-1851768135">The boring and ugly <em>Last-of-Us</em>-themed Dualsense controller from Sony cost $85 earlier this year</a>.</p> <p>Whatever it costs, you can expect it to go for much more when resellers inevitably grab up a ton of them and sell them on eBay. Heck, the original <em>Astro Bot</em> Dualsense controller still goes for <a href="https://www.ebay.com/sch/i.html?_nkw=Astro+Bot+controller&amp;_sacat=0&amp;_from=R40&amp;_trksid=p4432023.m570.l1313">$110 to $160 sealed on the internet’s ancient auction house</a>. So if you really want a joyful <em>Astro Bo</em>t-themed Dualsense controller and you don’t want to pay $200 or whatever, I’d be hanging out at your computer on September 12, ready to pre-order the moment they go live. Good luck with that!</p>
