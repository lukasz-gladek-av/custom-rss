              <p><em>Marathon</em> was supposed to be out months ago. Instead, its coming in March 2026. <a href="https://kotaku.com/playstation-bungie-marathon-destiny-2-acquisition-fiscal-2000642935">Bungie revealed the new launch timing</a> in a surprise video documentary that went live on Monday in which the game’s developers promise a sci-fi survival extraction shooter that’s full of mysteries and hidden dangers.</p> <p>The fresh 22-minute deep-dive goes over all of the elements of the project the studio’s been rehabbing since it was indefinitely delayed earlier this year following <a href="https://kotaku.com/marathon-alpha-review-impressions-bungie-extraction-fps-1851777775">harsh fan feedback</a> form its initial public alpha test. During that quiet period, Bungie held multiple closed beta tests to re-examine gameplay and introduced completely new features, including proximity chat. After becoming a corner stone of this fall’s hit rival extraction shooter, <a href="https://kotaku.com/arc-raiders-review-extraction-loot-shooter-embark-2000642198"><em>Arc Raiders</em></a>, the feature will now be a staple of <em>Marathon</em> as well.</p>

  <p>The <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjzmhROTv28">documentary also details</a> the development team’s evolving approach to everything from audio and visuals to zone design and loot mechanics. The goal is clear: make <em>Marathon</em>‘s maps and the experiences that take place there have more of an identity beyond repetitive beats within a grindy, quick-match PVP shooter. “We’ve brought a little bit of grounded-ness, a little bit of grit, a little bit of darkness, a little bit of that mood, that kind of is necessary for an extraction shooter to feel dangerous,” said producer Emanuel Rosu. ”</p>

 <p>The video went on to addressed a bunch of other complaints players had from the original public alpha test as well. That includes prioritizing solo play options, improving the visuals, and even making it so that opponent runners leave corpuses behind and decay instead of just appear as static back packs. There will be four maps at launch including an end-game area onboard UESC Marathon.</p>

 <p>In addition to upgrade trees, faction ranks, and unlocking rewards, Bungie is also promising some level of gun customization to change how weapons play, letting players invent iconic gear from the studio’s past like changing an SMG into Halo’s Needler.</p>

 <h2><em>Marathon</em> won’t be free-to-play</h2> <p><a href="https://www.bungie.net/7/en/News/Article/marathonvidoc">In a blog post</a>, Bungie outlined what the game’s approach to monetization will be, including battle passes that don’t expire and no pay-to-win mechanics:</p> <blockquote><p>Purchasing Marathon will give you full access to the game, including a roadmap of free gameplay updates as the year progresses. This will include new maps, new Runner shells, events, and more, starting with the exploration of UESC Marathon’s Cryo Archive in Season 1.</p> <p>We also want to ensure you are logging in because you love the game, not from fear of missing out—so Marathon’s Rewards Passes will not expire, and you’ll be able purchase and unlock prior Passes.</p> <p>Finally, and most importantly, we believe in preserving competitive integrity in Marathon, so survival will never come down to how much money you spend.</p></blockquote> <p>This is essentially the <em>Helldivers 2</em> playbook, which served that smash-hit live service game well. As a PVEVP game, however <em>Marathon</em> will have additional challenges of balancing other hostile players with its bespoke world-building. We’ll see how that works in practice in just a few months.</p>

              <p>At the top of the attention-seeking tree at this year’s Game Awards was Larian—the massive independent studio behind 2023’s most fantastic game, <em>Baldur’s Gate 3—</em>with their <a href="https://kotaku.com/game-awards-statue-elder-scrolls-6-geoff-keighley-2000651010">silly statue in the desert</a> and then the most <a href="https://kotaku.com/divinity-original-sin-3-rpg-trailer-larian-bg4-game-awards-2000652714">astonishingly unpleasant trailer</a> for their next RPG project, <em>Divinity</em>. I couldn’t be more thrilled about the prospect of returning to Rivellon, but given there will be years left to wait for that, I’m instead delighted to notice that the previous game in that series, <em>Divinity: Original Sin II</em>, is now officially updated for Switch 2.</p> <p>2017’s release of&nbsp;<em>DOS2</em> was the moment Larian really established itself as one of the all-time leading RPG developers. The&nbsp;<em>Divinity</em> series began with the decent enough action-RPG <em>Divine Divinity</em> in 2002, followed by the decidedly mediocre <em>Beyond Divinity</em> in 2004, which was slammed for its crappy story and lack of originality. Things didn’t improve enormously in 2009 when <em>Divinity II</em> came out riddled with bugs, dragged down further by a poor Xbox 360 version, but they started to look up a year later when an improved and much-fixed re-release appeared and won people over. Things went quiet for a fair while, with the peculiar but successful decision to release a real-time strategy game set in the same universe in 2013, but it was in 2014 that <em>Divinity: Original Sin</em> appeared and blew everyone’s socks off.</p> <div><blockquote data-bluesky-uri="at://did:plc:4bbrhyv7c6do5ppnm2x45erw/app.bsky.feed.post/3m7zy4hmc2s2f" data-bluesky-cid="bafyreibgjrqtfuedbh6x6aewtxnpfmqmd37vuihsdms747dglpcx6mfm4e"> <p lang="en">The plot thinnens.</p> <p>With a 93 Metacritic score, the award-winning Divinity: Original Sin 2 is now yours to play on Nintendo Switch 2, Xbox Series X|S, and PlayStation 5!</p> <p>Upgrade for free or begin your adventure today and prepare for what lies ahead.</p> <p>youtu.be/_K_vKMo7DEI?…</p> <p>— <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/did:plc:4bbrhyv7c6do5ppnm2x45erw?ref_src=embed">Larian Studios (@larianstudios.com)</a> <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/did:plc:4bbrhyv7c6do5ppnm2x45erw/post/3m7zy4hmc2s2f?ref_src=embed">2025-12-15T15:46:30.537Z</a></p></blockquote></div>  <p>Suddenly this studio known for somewhat generic action-RPGs appeared with an epic, old-school, party-based RPG that was delighting crowds. Its story was still its weaker area, but this was like a butterfly compared to Larian’s previous caterpillars. However, it would be three years later than every single element would come together into one glorious whole with the release of&nbsp;<em>Divinity: Original Sin II</em>, one of the all-time best RPGs ever released.</p>

 <p>Funded by Kickstarter and released into Early Access in September 2016, a year’s development followed in communication with its community, and this seemed to be the magic ingredient Larian needed. That, and releasing a beefed-up, improved and lengthened Definitive Edition a year later.</p>

 <p>The game was so good that it allowed hundreds of thousands of people to feel extremely smug when <em>Baldur’s Gate 3</em> broke through to the wider mainstream in 2023 (following its own Early Access), knowing they were there before it was cool. But now, with the announcement of Larian’s next project&nbsp;<em>Divinity</em>, an awful lot of people are going to want to go back and fill in the gaps.</p>

 <p>If you’re one of those people, you really don’t need to worry about anything before <em>DOS.&nbsp;</em>You can pick that up on PC, Xbox and PlayStation. But honestly, if I were you, I’d just dive straight into the sequel. It’s a standalone story, and it’s a superior game. It’s one of <em>the</em> superior games! And now it’s been given a sprucing up to shine on modern consoles, including the Switch 2.</p>  <p>I’m absolutely psyched for an excuse to play it all over again. I’m going to pick this up for Switch 2, and I’m going to remember to get the trait for speaking to animals from the very start. (Seriously, if you don’t, you’ll miss out on&nbsp;<em>so</em> much.)</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/tp-link-wi-fi-7-adapter-drops-to-an-all-time-low-making-the-upgrade-from-wi-fi-6-cheaper-than-ever-2000653345</link>

              <p>If your current laptop or PC lacks built-in wireless capabilities or only supports outdated Wi-Fi standards, adding a dedicated adapter to the setup can get you the speeds you’re looking for. TP-Link makes some of our favorite wireless connectivity solutions out there, and right now, you can grab a solid adapter by the brand without paying the full price.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6398/">The TP-Link BE6200 Tri-Band Wi-Fi 7 wireless USB 3.0 adapter archer is currently available for $80 at Amazon, after a nice 38% or $50 discount.</a> This is the lowest it’s dropped to in the last 90 days, which means it’s one of those leftover Black Friday deals that survived the chaotic event. Such deals, however, tend to wrap up fast, so it’s best to grab yourself a solid adapter while the discount is still live. Getting your orders in today should help them arrive before Christmas, which is great if you’re planning to stream or game with friends during the holidays and don’t want slow internet speeds ruining the experience.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6398/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Reliable Signals</h2>
<p>This USB 3.0 adapter comes with two bifurcated high-gain antennas and a detachable cradle with a 1.2-meter cable. The beamforming technology helps direct the Wi-Fi signal towards your router for incredible reception and more reliable signals, even from farther away. When it’s paired with a Wi-Fi 7 router, you can enjoy the 6 GHz band that further improves wireless performance with 160MHz, Multi-RUs, and 4K-QAM. The 6 GHz band offers speeds of up to 2,882 Mbps, while you’ll get 2,594 Mbps on the 5 GHz band, and 688 Mbps on the 2.4 GHz band. These translate into ultra-fast downloads, smooth gaming, and better 4K/8K streaming.</p>
<p>The powerful combination of OFDMA and MU-MIMO technology lets you connect a bunch of devices to your router at the same time, without compromising on the speeds on any of those. Setting everything up couldn’t be any simpler. You can plug the adapter directly into the USB port of your device, or place it nearby using the cradle. The Archer TBE401UH is compatible with Windows 11/10, plus it comes with a preloaded driver, meaning you won’t have to worry about following any complicated installation processes to get started.</p>



<p>Those who take cybersecurity seriously (as everyone should) will appreciate how TP-Link is a signatory of the U.S. Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency’s (CISA) Secure-by-Design pledge. The adapter is built and maintained with advanced security. On top of that, the latest WiFi security protocol improves encryption to protect your Wi-Fi passwords and defend against online attacks.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6398/">This tiny but mighty device is now down to $80, and is sure to solve all your PC-related internet issues for good.</a> We’d recommend grabbing it at its retail price, too, but the current deal makes it a no-brainer. Be sure to grab it before the retailer decides to push the price back up for good.</p>
