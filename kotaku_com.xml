            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>For a long while, Xbox Game Pass Ultimate was colloquially known as the best deal in gaming—and for a good reason. Unlimited access to tons of awesome games, big and small, for a pretty reasonable price. But then in late 2025, Microsoft announced a staggering 50% price hike, bringing the service from $20 per month to $30 per month. By the end of the year, that’s an extra $120 out of pocket you would not have had to spend had the price stayed the same.</p>
<p>The service is still great, it’s just a little more expensive than most folks would like it to be. Though right now, it’s come back down a bit when you buy from StackSocial. It’s not back down to its original price, but it’s partway there. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/7033/">The StackSocial deal brings the one month price down from $30 to just $25, and it brings the three-month price down from $90 to just $74.</a></p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/7033/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at StackSocial</a></p>

<p>What’s really good is that the membership is stackable as well as not being region locked. This means you can load up on a bunch and set yourself up with Game Pass Ultimate for the foreseeable future at the reduced rate.</p>
<p data-start="0" data-end="377">If you own a Samsung TV from 2023 or later, you don’t even need to own an Xbox. Thanks to Samsung Gaming Hub, these newer TVs can stream games directly from the cloud, no console required. Pair an Xbox controller, sign into Xbox Game Pass Ultimate, and you’re instantly playing major releases like <em data-start="326" data-end="337">Starfield</em> or <em data-start="341" data-end="356">Halo Infinite</em> straight on your TV.</p>


<h2 data-start="379" data-end="419">A Library That’s Easy to Get Lost In</h2>
<p data-start="421" data-end="654">Game Pass Ultimate opens the door to more than 500 games, covering everything from experimental indies to blockbuster releases.</p>
<p data-start="656" data-end="1346"><em data-start="656" data-end="663">Tunic</em> is a standout. At first glance, it looks like a charming throwback to the early <em data-start="744" data-end="751">Zelda</em> era, with an isometric view and a cute fox hero. Dig a little deeper and the game reveals its clever hook: the entire world speaks in a fictional language. Menus, dialogue, and instructions are all unreadable at first. As you explore, you discover pages from an in-game instruction manual, styled after the booklets that used to come tucked inside game boxes. Those pages slowly teach you how the game works, while also hinting at its secrets and lore. The result is a constant stream of satisfying revelations.</p>
<p data-start="1382" data-end="1707">Indie gems like <em data-start="1398" data-end="1405">Tunic</em> share space with major AAA titles. Xbox Game Pass Ultimate regularly delivers high-profile games on day one, including recent additions like <em data-start="1547" data-end="1583">Indiana Jones and the Great Circle</em>. The subscription also includes EA Play at no extra cost, adding popular series such as <em data-start="1672" data-end="1682">The Sims</em> and <em data-start="1687" data-end="1695">Madden</em> to the mix.</p>
<p data-start="1709" data-end="1980">On top of that, Game Pass Ultimate bundles in Xbox Live features, unlocking online multiplayer for any supported game in the catalog.</p>

              <p><span>As Netflix and its various partners try to catch up with </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/kpop-demon-hunters-streaming-box-office-numbers-netflix-2000622381"><i><span>KPop Demon Hunters</span></i><span>’ runaway success</span></a><span>, Lego has announced it’s releasing multiple sets based on the animated musical in the coming year, the first of which will be available this summer.</span></p> <p><span>The </span><a href="https://www.lego.com/en-us/themes/kpop-demon-hunters/about"><span>announcement</span></a><span> doesn’t show any of the sets in full, but it does have a brief tease of what looks like a model of Derpy, the demon tiger and pseudo-mascot of the movie, knocking down a potted plant made up of Legos. Fans will know that one of Derpy’s quirks is that he knocks down plants like a regular cat, but becomes fixated on trying (and, without thumbs, failing) to set them back up. The set will come later in 2026, with more planned to launch in 2027. There’s no sign yet of Huntr/x, the titular Kpop demon hunter group, but the trio did show up in Lego form in last year’s </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/kpop-demon-hunters-fortnite-rei-ami-stream-zoey-rumi-2000632536"><i><span>Fortnite </span></i><span>collaboration</span></a><span>, so we’ll probably be getting minifigures of Rumi, Mira, and Zoey at some point.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>   <p><span>While Netflix and Sony were clearly not prepared for just </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/kpop-demon-hunters-most-popular-netflix-streaming-2000620409"><span>how big </span><i><span>KPop Demon Hunters </span></i><span>was going to be last year</span></a><span>, the merchandise and collaborations that have been slowly trickling out over the past eight months or so have been pretty great. Mattel Creations is releasing some </span><a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/DQw0rgijTAI/?hl=en"><span>gorgeous Huntr/x dolls</span></a><span> of the girls in their outfits for </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/kpop-demon-hunters-your-idol-saja-boys-demo-rumi-ejae-2000645529"><span>“What It Sounds Like,”</span></a><span> and there’s surely going to be a lot more to come. Many of the products we’ve seen are expensive collector’s items, however, so hopefully we see more stuff that is actually appropriate for the film’s younger fans, too.</span></p>

 <p><i><span>KPop Demon Hunters </span></i><span>is </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/kpop-demon-hunters-2-sequel-netflix-release-date-2029-2000641414"><span>getting a sequel</span></a><span>, but it sounds like it’s a long ways away, as Sony and Netflix are currently aiming for a 2029 release. The first movie is still having a moment, though, as it’s been cleaning up this award season on both the film and music side. </span></p>

In a multi-monitor setup, it offers that expansive, gapless view, which minimizes distractions, making for a truly immersive viewing experience. The 32-inch size is fairly modest; it’s not too massive, but also not too small for content to feel cramped.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/amazon-goes-big-on-smart-speaker-deals-as-echo-dot-max-falls-to-record-low-comes-with-alexa-early-access-2000665550</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>The Amazon Echo Dot Max is an extremely compact Alexa speaker that lets you better manage your smart home and enhances room audio capabilities compared to past Echo Dot speakers. It produces room-filling sound, and its new, larger, rounded design is covered in 3D-knit fabric that blends easily into a shelf or side table without drawing too much attention. Inside, the AZ3 chip supports Alexa+, and a built-in smart home hub lets you treat this speaker as a central point for both audio playback and smart home control.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6550/">You can pick up the Amazon Echo Dot Max on Amazon.com for $80, which is $20 off the normal $100 retail price, or 20% off.</a></p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6550/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>A full-featured smart speaker with a variety of features</h2>
<p>One of the speaker’s strongest features is its ability to deliver a focused sound in each room, with emphasized low frequencies, clean highs, and very clear vocals. It delivers room-focused sound thanks to the auto-tune feature, which adjusts how the speaker plays back sound based on its location. In addition to streaming music using Amazon Music or Spotify, you can connect an unlimited number of compatible Echo products in order to have the exact same audio playing at the exact same time, effectively expanding the overall stereo experience or even creating a compact home theatre system through the connection of a second Echo Dot Max or pairing with a variety of Fire TV products.</p>



<p>The Echo Dot Max offers more than just playing your music and enabling multi-room audio. It allows you to connect directly to many of your smart home devices from the speaker, without a central hub. You can also group smart devices and create smart home routines that perform tasks based on both schedules and triggers. With OmniSense technology, you can also use presence or temperature detection as triggers, letting the room automatically warm up or cool down, or turn lights on and off based on your activity.</p>
<p>You can control much more than simply playing playlists on your Echo Dot Max through Alexa and Alexa+. This device lets you set a timer or reminder, check the weather, do quick math , or turn on/off your smart home devices with just your voice, without grabbing your smartphone. If you sign up for Alexa + Early Access, you will have a proactive assistant that can respond to layered requests and help you accomplish long-running or complicated tasks.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6550/">At $80, down from the original $100 price, the Echo Dot Max offers a compelling option</a> if you want a compact Alexa speaker with improved audio, built-in smart home capabilities, and support for Alexa+ at a lower cost.</p>
