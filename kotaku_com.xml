              <p><span>I do not fear many things in </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/overwatch-2-spotlight-new-heroes-perks-stadium-returning-2000665736"><i><span>Overwatch</span></i></a><span>, but I am beginning to fear Jetpack Cat. The flying feline hero is exactly what she sounds like, a cat that has endless flight and zooms around the map healing allies and pestering foes. However, she also has the ability to tether her teammates to her craft and fly them around the battlefield. The strategies and combos players have already found in just a brief early access period are incredibly chaotic.</span></p> <p><span>I played a little bit of Jetpack Cat myself when I </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/overwatch-2-spotlight-story-vendetta-cinematic-new-heroes-2000665327"><span>tried my hand at all five of </span><i><span>Overwatch</span></i><span>’s new heroes last month</span></a><span>, and while I don’t think she will be joining my support hero rotation anytime soon, I’m already anticipating the ridiculous plays teams will pull off with her if they’re coordinating. The cat’s tether requires a teammate to opt in, meaning you don’t have to worry about any </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/overwatch-2-hero-lifeweaver-season-4-patch-change-ptr-1850302565"><span>Lifeweaver-style trolling</span></a><span> or accidentally latching onto her and being taken for a ride.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><span>Once you’re tethered, Jetpack Cat can fly you anywhere, as long as you don’t get shot down by the enemy team. But her tether isn’t limited to just teammates, it can also pick up things like Ashe’s Omnic ultimate B.O.B. as he fires down on the unsuspecting foes below, or D.Va’s mech suit after she’s set it to self destruct. This way you have a brief window to fix a bad play or placement. Meanwhile, Jetpack Cat’s ultimate lets her tether onto an enemy and drag them off the map or out of a fortified area, so you’re not just restricted to picking up friendlies. There’s a lot of potential and not a ton of limitations. Some early players have used dueling Jetpack Cats to pit two of their respective teammates against each other in an airborne battle.</span></p> <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">another funny clip from the frogger stream <a href="https://t.co/O9V4D28o24">https://t.co/O9V4D28o24</a> <a href="https://t.co/vbSkuGZ7Yd">pic.twitter.com/vbSkuGZ7Yd</a></p> <p>— VizFint (@VFlince) <a href="https://twitter.com/VFlince/status/2019174652342595621?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">February 4, 2026</a></p></blockquote>  <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">FROGGER HOW COULD YOU DO THAT TO THE CAT <a href="https://t.co/dfRVcY7chp">pic.twitter.com/dfRVcY7chp</a></p> <p>— VizFint (@VFlince) <a href="https://twitter.com/VFlince/status/2019142721617998175?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">February 4, 2026</a></p></blockquote>  <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="ko" dir="ltr">신캐로 암살 야무지게 하시는데; <a href="https://t.co/3QOyiCnRgy">pic.twitter.com/3QOyiCnRgy</a></p> <p>— 진 (@nojamgirl_) <a href="https://twitter.com/nojamgirl_/status/2019190825696240049?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">February 4, 2026</a></p></blockquote>  <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="ja" dir="ltr">■新サポート<br>「ジェットパックキャット」</p> <p>無制限に浮游＆味方を引っ張れる模様👀</p> <p>🎬:SEjFiNN <a href="https://t.co/rliVJC8Ukj">pic.twitter.com/rliVJC8Ukj</a></p> <p>— Overwatch2ニュース@おばにゅー (@Overwatch2_NEWS) <a href="https://twitter.com/Overwatch2_NEWS/status/2019122454837563574?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">February 4, 2026</a></p></blockquote>  <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">never in my life did i expect to see a mauga and bastion duking it out in the skybox of illios lighthouse LMAOO <a href="https://twitter.com/zbra_ow?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@zbra_ow</a> <a href="https://t.co/4i8zposR3c">pic.twitter.com/4i8zposR3c</a></p> <p>— lightt (@ow_lightt) <a href="https://twitter.com/ow_lightt/status/2019180084297650584?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">February 4, 2026</a></p></blockquote>  <p><span>Jetpack Cat is joining the </span><i><span>Overwatch </span></i><span>roster on February 10 as the game undergoes a bit of a revamp, restructuring its seasonal rollout to </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/overwatch-cinematic-doomfist-vendetta-death-reign-talon-2000665013"><span>incorporate lore</span></a><span> and releasing a total of 10 heroes across the next year.</span></p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/pc-gaming-graphics-cards-are-basically-a-rounding-error-for-nvidia-and-its-acting-like-it-2000666077</link>
            <guid>1427494</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Nvidia is becoming that old friend who refuses to break it off but has clearly moved on. <em>Nioh 3</em>‘s devs don’t believe in adding an easy mode. And I’m not shocked but I am still disappointed that <em>Oblivion Remastered</em> isn’t even getting a game key card for its Switch 2 release. It’s the latest edition of Morning Checkpoint, <em>Kotaku</em>‘s daily roundup of gaming news, rumors, and culture. I’m closely and cautiously monitoring the <a href="https://famiboards.com/threads/monolith-soft-development-and-speculation-st.51/page-59#post-2168268"><em>Xenoblade Chronicles 4</em> gossip</a> in hopes it might secretly end up being one of Nintendo’s big fall games for this year. That feels slightly ahead of schedule but a boy can dream.</p> <h2>Nvidia isn’t denying reports that its GeForce graphics card plans have slowed</h2> <p><em><a href="https://www.theinformation.com/articles/nvidia-delay-new-gaming-chip-due-memory-chip-shortage" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-cy="styled-link">The Information</a> </em>reports that the tech company at the epicenter of AI market shockwaves is scaling back producing of its 50-series graphics cards and delaying a mid-gen refresh of its Blackwell designs. <a href="https://x.com/kopite7kimi/status/2008900087469257149?s=20">Hardware leaker Kopite7kimi</a> is claiming that a new 6090 batch of cards won’t appear until late 2027. And Nvidia isn’t pumping the brakes on all of this speculative doom and gloom.</p>

 <p>“Demand for GeForce RTX GPUs is strong, and memory supply is constrained,” it <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-nvidia-geforce-rtx-5080-super-is-probably-dead-thanks-to-ai">told <em>IGN</em></a> in a new statement. “We continue to ship all GeForce SKUs and are working closely with our suppliers to maximize memory availability.” I feel better already! Don’t you?</p> <p>But honestly, pulling back on PC gaming is exactly what every market signal is telling Nvidia to do at the moment. It’s quarterly revenue in 2014 was $1.23 billion. That set a record at the time. Last quarter it earned $4.3 billion from PC gaming alone, but gaming revenue was a much smaller proportion of the company’s business overall. Total revenue was over $50 billion, setting an all new record in which PC gaming accounted for just 8 percent.</p>

 <p>In the meantime, Nvidia just agreed to dump $20 billion into OpenAI after originally promising up to $100 billion. That might seem like it’s hedging its bets, but $20 billion is still more than all the money the company will earn from its PC gaming business in the next year.</p>

 <h2>Ubisoft devs grill management on the publisher’s missteps</h2> <p>A townhall Q&amp;A with CEO Yves Guillemot and others to re-instill confidence in the rank-and-file did anything but, according to <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ubisofts-internal-town-hall-fails-to-reassure-employees-on-its-future/"><em>Insider Gaming</em></a>. The leadership team remained adamantly opposed to altering the company’s controversial new RTO policy and defended it by pointing to similar policies at competitors like Riot Games, Activision Blizzard, and Rockstar Games. What about more mass layoffs? In response to a question about cuts of over 2,000 employees, CFO Frederik Duguet was less than reassuring. “First of all, we must state very clearly that we have never shared such numbers externally, and as I’ve just said, we won’t share any more decisions today,” he reportedly told the group.</p> <h2>Square Enix has big <em>FF7</em> plans for 2026</h2> <p>“This year, we plan to share more updates on the <em>Final Fantasy VII Remake </em>Project than ever before,” director Naoki Hamaguchi <a href="https://twitter.com/nhamaguc/status/2019428998875590885?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E2019428998875590885%7Ctwgr%5Ea5650f6b73caef1736c385f75f5a3900b90de88a%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ign.com%2Farticles%2Fsquare-enix-will-share-more-updates-than-ever-before-on-final-fantasy-7-remake-project-this-year-says-director">shared on Thursday</a> after it was confirmed that <em>Rebirth</em> is coming to both Switch 2 and Xbox on June 3. Does that mean we’ll finally get the third part of the trilogy before the end of 2026? Or is this just the marketing machine ramping up for an early 2027 launch? It probably depends on <em>Grand Theft Auto 6</em>, as every other release date will this year.</p>

 <h2><em>Borderlands 4</em>‘s newest content arrives later this month</h2> <p><em>Bounty Pack 2: Legend of the Stone Demon</em> will go live on February 26, Gearbox Entertainment confirmed on Thursday. It will be “bite-sized-yet-flavorful narrative content” alongside free updates like the addition of Pearlescent gear. The next batch of main story missions, meanwhile, is called <em>Mad Ellie and the Vault of the</em> <em>Damned</em> and they’re coming in March along with a new vault hunter, the ex-casino bot C4SH.</p> <h2>Hideo Kojima is back in the video editing bay</h2> <p>“Editing for the first time in…8 months?” he <a href="https://x.com/HIDEO_KOJIMA_EN/status/2019389612716966356?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E2019389612716966356%7Ctwgr%5Eb7be707bf7388a8828069325edeb08d9957ec2a4%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamesradar.com%2Fgames%2Faction%2Fhideo-kojima-is-teasing-something-ahead-of-the-rumored-state-of-play-and-almost-everyones-thinking-the-same-thing-pc-trailer-for-death-stranding-2%2F">tweeted</a> with a sad face. Could this be for the rumored PlayStation State of Play taking place later this month? Current guesses are a PC port of <em>Death Stranding 2</em> or a big DLC for it. Surely it’s too early for anything else?</p> <h2><em>Nioh 3</em> will not be giving casual players a break anytime soon</h2> <p>“We’ve never considered adding difficulty settings to the <em>Nioh</em> series,” director Masaki Fujita <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/difficulty-settings-nioh-team-ninja-game-director-interview">told <em>Eurogamer</em></a>. “The value of clearing the game is something that is unifying, and since <em>Nioh 3</em> has even more variations on strategies to clear the game compared to previous games in the series, our approach is not to change the difficulty setting when you can’t clear it.”</p>

 <h2>Bethesda finds something Switch 2 players hate more than game key cards</h2> <p><em>Indiana Jones and the Great Circle</em> will come to Nintendo’s portable console as a cartridge with the full game on it. <em>Fallout 4</em> and<em> Oblivion Remastered</em>, however, will not. They won’t even be game key cards. <a href="https://bethesda.net/en/article/17ZQE6BiOoEfIFRJJTtfz2/bethesda-games-coming-to-nintendo-switch-2">They’ll just be download codes in boxes</a>. It sounds par for the course with how rough the ports look.</p> <h2>ICYMI:</h2> <ul> <li><strong><a href="https://kotaku.com/steam-machine-price-release-date-preorder-ai-valve-2000665802">The AI tech weirdos forced Valve to delay its Steam Machine</a></strong></li> <li><strong><a href="https://kotaku.com/overwatch-2-spotlight-story-vendetta-cinematic-new-heroes-2000665327">Everything coming to <em>Overwatch</em> in its biggest year ever</a></strong></li> <li><strong><a href="https://kotaku.com/fallout-season-two-review-amazon-more-episodes-bethesda-new-vegas-2000665533"><em>Fallout</em> season 2 was fun to watch but terrible TV&nbsp;</a></strong></li> </ul> <h2>Watch this:</h2>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Are male ski jumpers injecting a specific kind of acid into their penises in order to gain a small advantage over their competitors? Maybe. But if so, don’t worry, Winter Olympics officials are on it.</p> <p><a href="https://www.bbc.com/sport/articles/czej70jyg4eo">As reported by the BBC</a>, there’s been a strange rumor floating around men’s ski jumping, and it all started after <a href="https://www.bild.de/sport/mehr-sport/skispringen-skisprung-verband-reagiert-auf-penis-wirbel-695cb73efb77630dac278cdd">German newspaper <em>Bild</em></a> reported in January that some athletes were injecting hyaluronic acid into their penises before being measured by officials for their tight-fitting suits. Why? Apparently, the acid, which is not banned, causes the injected penis to grow in circumference by about one to two centimeters, or a little less than an inch. In theory, this would increase the surface area of the ski suit during jumps, which could possibly increase how far a skier flies and help them eke out a win.</p> <p>“Every extra centimetre on a suit counts. If your suit has a 5 percent bigger surface area, you fly further,” ski jumping men’s race director Sandro Pertile told the BBC. Before the start of a season, ski jumpers are 3D scanned and measured to create skin-tight suits. Part of the measuring process includes the amount of fabric around the crotch. So a bit more girth could provide a little more fabric, and that could equal a slightly longer jump.</p>  <p>There’s just one problem with this wild theory: There is no evidence that it’s happening at the Winter Olympics.</p> <p>International Ski and Snowboard Federation (FIS) communications director Bruno Sassi told the BBC that there has “never been any indication” nor “evidence” that a male skier has injected hyaluronic acid into their penis to gain an unfair advantage. Though it is also possible that this is happening, and nobody has been caught yet.</p> <p>“I am not aware of the details of ski jumping, and how that could improve performance,” World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) director Olivier Niggli said when asked about the penis injection claims during a recent Winter Olympics press conference. “If anything was to come to the surface, we would look at it and see if it is doping-related. We don’t address other [non-doping] means of enhancing performance.”</p> <p>WADA’s Polish president Witold Banka added: “Ski jumping is very popular in Poland, so I promise you I’m going to look at it.”</p> <p>The Winter Olympics start on Friday in Italy. Men’s ski jumping begins on Monday.</p>

Specifically, the women of Blizzard’s hero shooter have suffered from a bit of “same face syndrome” for years, with characters like Widowmaker, Ashe, and Freja being nearly identical in some skins. However, it’s gotten especially bad for the game’s East Asian heroes since Kiriko came onto the scene in 2022. Now Anran, one of the new heroes joining the game next week, is the latest victim of this phenomenon.</span></p>  <p><span>Anran is a fire-wielding hero and the sister of the game’s </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/overwatch-2-wuyang-trial-trailer-story-gameplay-voice-2000616929"><span>water-bending support hero Wuyang</span></a><span>. As such, she appeared in animated trailers, comics, and other lore before she was implemented into the game itself. Before her in-game appearance, she was depicted with a longer nose and sharper features, and overall had a distinct face compared to other characters on the roster. Now that we’ve seen her in the game itself, however, fans have pointed out that her face is much more round and her nose has been shrunken down to the same button nose Kiriko and Juno have.&nbsp;</span></p>

              <p><span>Usually, trailers for upcoming games tend to show good gameplay. You know, things like attacks that land and shots that actually hit their targets—stuff that might get players excited about the idea of being </span><i><span>good </span></i><span>at a game. But when promoting two of the biggest third-party games coming to Switch, Nintendo has thrown that idea out the window, presumably to avoid sullying its family-friendly image with gory violence.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>During Thursday’s </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/nintendo-direct-february-switch-2-oblivion-fallout-2000665999"><span>Nintendo Partner Direct</span></a><span>, Nintendo showed off </span><i><span>Resident Evil Requiem</span></i><span> and </span><i><span>Indiana Jones and the Great Circle</span></i><span>, two games headed to its new portable console in the next few months. What stood out most about these segments wasn’t the visual quality of the two blockbusters running on less powerful hardware, however, but how terrible whoever was capturing the footage was at playing the games.</span></p>

 <figure id="attachment_2000666131" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000666131"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000666131">Bethesda</figcaption></figure> <p><span>The Direct’s trailers for both games were full of missed shots and poorly-timed attacks, as pointed out by former </span><i><span>Kotaku</span></i><span> EIC </span><a href="https://bsky.app/profile/stephentotilo.bsky.social/post/3me4ntqnrns2l"><span>Stephen Totilo</span></a> <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/apzonerunner.com/post/3me4mfg3mak2j"><span>and others</span></a><span>. One shot from the </span><i><span>Requiem </span></i><span>trailer showed Leon Kennedy picking up a zombie’s chainsaw to fight off enemies only to miss and hit the railing on a bed, causing sparks to fly. Another shot from the </span><i><span>Great Circle </span></i><span>trailer showed Indiana Jones missing a boat full of Nazis and hitting the water below them instead.</span><span><br> </span><span><br> </span><span>The </span><i><span>Requiem </span></i><span>trailer is especially funny to watch—the narrator raves about Leon’s “physical prowess” and how “he can fire from a distance using handguns and rifles” over clips of him missing shots by literal feet. Compared to </span><a href="https://youtu.be/T54OWinnymM?si=L4rujiQUA9nYDYd2"><span>a recent Capcom trailer for <em>Requiem</em></span></a><span>, which has no problem showing some pretty graphic stuff, it seems clear Nintendo went out of its way to hide the violence in its latest showcase.&nbsp;</span></p> <figure id="attachment_2000666132" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000666132"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000666132">Capcom</figcaption></figure> <p><span>Nintendo hasn’t been very keen on showing violence in previous Directs, either. When it announced a Switch port of </span><i><span>The Witcher 3 </span></i><span>during its </span><a href="https://youtu.be/Zr9eAtwcYlo?si=zAk1fiwKEOnXWZTo"><span>Direct at E3 2019</span></a><span>, it edited out a clip of the game’s notorious hanging tree that </span><a href="https://youtu.be/BAC-jqZTCv8?si=b_IcTCmAfUTeP4lj"><span>was shown in online uploads of the trailer in some regions</span></a><span>.</span></p>

 <p><span>Other trailers for more violent games that have been ported onto Nintendo systems, like </span><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ijqVBkgZ79Y&amp;pp=ygUaY3liZXJwdW5rIHN3aXRjaCAyIHRyYWlsZXI%3D"><i><span>Cyberpunk 2077</span></i></a><span>, have received more atmospheric trailers that avoid showing gameplay. Some trailers haven’t been shown at all. The </span><a href="https://youtu.be/ztMGTTAjsAQ?si=PSgtM6Au08YQdbM1"><span>2017 Direct announcement</span></a><span> for </span><i><span>Wolfenstein 2</span></i><span>, a shooter about murdering tons of Nazis, lacked a trailer entirely and was revealed only with a still image of key art. And, during the same Direct, gameplay for </span><i><span>Doom </span></i><span>featured more apparently intentionally bad gameplay, clips in which the player fires off to the side of enemies without landing any hits alongside one shot where the player is about to be attacked and…does nothing at all.</span></p>

 <figure id="attachment_2000666133" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000666133"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000666133">CD Projekt Red</figcaption></figure> <p><span>Contrast that with how the developers themselves sometimes show their games being played on Nintendo’s consoles. </span><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CN7VJ1zec0g"><span>Here’s a CD Projekt Red trailer</span></a><span> for </span><i><span>Cyberpunk 2: Ultimate Edition</span></i><span> showing off Joy-Con motion controls. It shows a woman mimicking the real-life hand gesture to throw a grenade whose explosion proceeds to decapitate the enemy on screen. Later she frantically slashes the air to slice through enemies with a katana. No one in the video misses a single kill and they’re all smiling while they do it.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>Putting smiles on players’ faces is Nintendo’s corporate mission, but not with bullets and blood, apparently, at least when the Nintendo Direct cameras are rolling. We don’t have confirmation from Nintendo that it’s an intentional policy, but it’s certainly a recurring theme. However, it’s clear that Nintendo at least has a complicated relationship with the trailers for M-rated games, more of which are getting ported to Switch 2 every day.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><span>While today was certainly an embarrassing day for poor Leon Kennedy, as a big gamer who could definitely be a </span><i><span>better </span></i><span>gamer myself, I at least felt a little represented by the horrible gameplay shown off.&nbsp;</span></p>

              <p>For over a year, buying booster packs of <em>Pokémon</em> cards on the official Pokémon Center website has required either the most extraordinary luck, or a bot. When new stock is added to the site, it very quickly collapses under the weight of incoming traffic, leading to error messages or queues that never resolve. Any who do manage to get in before the site goes down are limited by strict purchase restrictions, except of course for those running the bots that are able to scoop up the stock in milliseconds. So was today’s peculiar decision to bundle the enormously popular Surging Sparks booster boxes with the never-wanted and very bulky Pokémon Academy boxes a deliberate troll of the scalpers by The Pokémon Company?</p> <p>Surging Sparks is the set that’s generally considered to be the beginning of the current frenzy that’s seen <a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-magic-the-gathering-scalpers-cards-2000632017">Pokémon cards become almost impossible to buy</a> for the last 15 months, where rocketing resale prices have led to scalping ruining the hobby for so many, and indeed <a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-tcg-theft-card-store-phantasmal-flames-2000651666">strings</a> of <a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-card-shops-robbed-100k-nyc-masked-thieves-anime-backpacks-recently-opened-2000660233">robberies</a> at <a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-store-poke-court-nyc-manhattan-robbery-donation-2000662652">many specialist retailers</a> around the world. Its <a href="https://www.pokemoncenter.com/product/BUNDLE1157/scarlet-and-violet-surging-sparks-booster-display-box-and-battle-academy-bundle">restock today on the U.S. Pokémon Center website</a> was therefore something of a surprise—occurring without promotion and of course inevitably selling out before most were aware it was even happening. Except, rather than these 36-pack containers appearing for the usual price of around $160, today’s booster boxes were all bundled with the latest edition of the Battle Academy, a hefty $20 box that’s designed to introduce new players to the table-top card game, and all for the undiscounted price of $180.</p>

 <p>If you’re already familiar with the&nbsp;<em>Pokémon TCG</em>, you’ve likely already snorted a laugh at this. For everyone else, it’s important to know that the Battle Academy is to <em>Pokémon</em> cards what the Fisher Price telephone is to the iPhone. It contains a chunky playing board, push-out cardboard counters, and three 60-card decks with special, numbered cards that don’t feature the standard <em>Pokémon&nbsp;</em>card back designs, nor even a single holo among them. Even better, the Battle Academy hasn’t been updated in so many years that they still sport the late 2010’s Pokémon V cards. They are, in the scheme of collecting, worthless.</p> <p>This has to be a troll, right? While it won’t have cost any more in shipping (the Pokémon Center is unreasonably good on this, waiving shipping costs for purchases over $20), it’s going to be such an epic pain in the ass for the scalpers, as their every shipment arrives with this enormous extra box of stuff they don’t want or need, and most of all, cannot resell. It’s an extra $20 too, which is just enjoyably inconvenient.</p>

 <p>You could argue that this is also screwing over legitimate customers, and that’s sadly true. However, for independent card stores being repeatedly let down by The Pokémon Company’s official retail suppliers (according to multiple store owners I’ve spoken to in the UK since stock shortages began, the company is allegedly prioritizing larger retail chains over them) it’s a fantastic deal, given they can also sell the Battle Academy boxes to their younger customers.</p>

 <p>It’d be far better to see the Pokémon Center website actually spending the money to build an infrastructure that can cope when it stocks new TCG cards, but in the meantime, if this really was a way to just irritate scalpers, it’s hard not to give over a little kudos.</p>
