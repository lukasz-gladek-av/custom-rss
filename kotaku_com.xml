And that’s cool, but I’m here to convince you to leave that place and go explore the other locations. Seriously. You’ll thank me later. </p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="197298" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="Live Forever in the Universe of 'New World: Aeternum'" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="108" data-playlist="197298,197284,197260" data-current="197298"><div><p>Live Forever in the Universe of 'New World: Aeternum'</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197298/197298_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197298/197298_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197298/197298_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197298/197298_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"></video></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/indiana-jones-great-circle-review-is-it-good-pc-xbox-1851717174&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/indiana-jones-great-circle-review-is-it-good-pc-xbox-1851717174"><em>Indiana Jones and the Great Circle</em> is a fantastic video game</a></span>, one of the best of 2024, and easily Indy’s best interactive adventure to date. One of the reasons the game is so good is because it has some really detailed and packed maps, filled with quests and collectibles and puzzles and baddies to punch. Great stuff, truly! You could spend hours and hours in these digital sandboxes. And you might be tempted to do that in the very first area of <em>The Great Circle</em>, the Vatican City. However, I’m here to offer some advice: Leave the Vatican City. </p><p>Look, I get it. You are someone who likes to do everything in a map or level before you move on to the next one. You are a completionist and so, you want to complete everything in Vatican City. And in <em>The Great Circle</em>, fighting bad guys and solving mysteries is so enjoyable that you might just think, “Well, I’m having a good time and I got plenty more to do here, so no point in finishing the main quest and leaving!”  </p><p>However, you really should leave Vatican City and explore the other maps in <em>Indiana Jones and the Great Circle</em>. You might ask, “Why?” You might also ask, “Do the other maps have Antonio?” Well, to your second question, sadly no. But I can answer the first. </p><figure id="" data-id="fe455ff6979446d9af631de4973f5cd4" data-recommend-id="image://fe455ff6979446d9af631de4973f5cd4" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A screenshot shows Antonio from The Great Circle.

" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>I’d argue that Vatican City is the worst of the three main maps in the game. It’s not bad, but compared to the sands of Egypt and the jungles of Sukhothai, the Vatican City is fairly drab. Hang out here for 12 hours doing every little thing and you are delaying the enjoyment of seeing the other places and having even more fun! </p><p>Plus, and this isn’t a spoiler (unless you thought Indiana Jones might die before the end of the game...) but once you roll credits on <em>Great Circle</em> you can freely hop between all the maps and areas you visit. In fact, there are a few things you can’t finish <em>until </em>you’ve visited all the locales at least once.</p><p>So, take a deep breath, finish whatever last thing you were working on in Vatican City, and then move on and focus on <em>The Great Circle</em>’s main questline. Trust me! You’ll be glad you did. </p><p>Go see the other places! Punch Nazis in new parts of the world! Discover fresh puzzles to solve! Meet new characters! Enjoy the game’s thrilling storyline! I’m not saying to avoid side quests or collectibles entirely, but don’t get bogged down anywhere for too long. You’ll be free to return to all of these places later and with all your tools and skills. </p><p>Besides, Indiana Jones himself would be disappointed if you didn’t go out and explore new temples and ruins. And yes, you can return and check in on Antonio in the Vatican City whenever you want. And you should, he’s a good guy. </p><p> .<br></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
