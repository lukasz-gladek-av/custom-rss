              <p>A small store in California was <a href="https://kotaku.com/card-shop-pokemon-robbed-100k-hammer-rare-cards-thief-1851786241">robbed earlier this month</a>, and the thieves focused primarily on taking thousands of dollars’ worth of Labubu dolls. The owner says this happened only two months after opening her shop.</p> <p><a href="https://abc7.com/post/thousands-dollars-worth-labubu-dolls-stolen-la-puente-resale-shop/17465366/">As reported by ABC7,</a> Joanna Avendano’s One Stop Sales, located in La Puente, California, was burglarized on August 6 at around 2:00 a.m. local time. The owner explained that she was hit with a “gut feeling” to check her phone and noticed there was motion and sound coming from the store’s surveillance camera. Nobody was supposed to be there at the time. It was clear at that point that the place was being robbed. Four masked suspects entered the store after smashing in a window and proceeded to grab over $30,000 worth of inventory.</p> <p>“There was a lot taken, maybe like around $30,000 or more of inventory,” Avendano told the outlet.”We worked so hard to get to this point, and for them to just come in and, like nothing, take it all away, it’s really bad.”</p> <p><iframe loading="lazy" title="Thieves ransack LA County resale shop for its Labubu dolls" width="500" height="281" src="about:blank" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen="" data-rocket-lazyload="fitvidscompatible" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/0PUD3A0EDHo?feature=oembed"></iframe></p> <p>ABC7 reports that the suspects didn’t steal cash or high-end electronics in the store and instead focused on grabbing Labubu dolls and other collectible merchandise. Labubu dolls have become quite popular over the last year or so, thanks to TikTok and celebrities posting about the bizarre monster plushies with big eyes that come in various colors and designs.</p>

 <p>“I was watching everything, from when they got in, what they were taking,” said Avendano. “I was panicking because I was just…I couldn’t do anything.”</p> <p>Avendano told ABC7 that she believes the robbery was planned, explaining that a suspicious truck was parked near her store as she closed up before the robbery. She also thinks the thieves were watching the shop’s social media posts and were waiting for her to share news of a Labubu restock. The dolls are currently very hard to find as their popularity continues to grow, mostly pushed by the algorithm.</p> <p>In fact, it’s entirely possible you’ve never heard of these hard-to-find dolls, and if so, you aren’t alone. <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-08-11/tiktok-trends-are-driving-random-consumer-spending-spikes">As reported by <em>Bloomberg</em></a>, many younger people are posting on TikTok about how many odd trends have gone viral recently, including Labubu, and how confusing it’s all becoming. It almost feels like these trends aren’t coming about organically, but instead are a symptom of pop culture becoming dominated by dopamine hits and corporate-controlled algorithms. Monoculture is dead and its replacement sucks.</p> <p>On August 8, <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/DNFH1hTOOKV/?hl=en">Avendano shared a post on Instagram</a> claiming that police had recovered some of her stolen goods, including some Labubu dolls. However, she and local law enforcement are still asking residents in the area to report anything they might know to the Los Angeles County Sheriff’s Department City.</p> <p>——</p> <p>The Los Angeles County Sheriff’s Department City of Industry substation is investigating the burglary.</p>

              <p>The traditional Metroidvania format works something like this: As you gain new abilities, you gain access to new areas. That platform up there that’s completely unreachable? Come back when you’ve gained double-jump. That sort of thing. <em>Öoo</em> follows the same formula, except when you return to those previously explored levels, you realize that it was only your own imagination holding you back. The magic was in your heart all along.</p> <p><em>Öoo</em> is a puzzle-platformer in which you play a little Kawaii caterpillar whose body segments are made of bombs. At the start of the game you’re just the head, able to move left and right, and that’s it. To jump, Öoo (I’m assuming that’s its name) needs to plop down a bomb and sit on top when it explodes. To jump a gap to the right, put down a bomb and stand on its right side when you explode it. That reasonably simple concept is how you begin exploring an ever-growing map, occasionally picking up yellow fly-like creatures and delivering them to large frogs that are blocking your way so you can proceed. And this all works tremendously well! It’s a novel concept for a platform game, one in which jumping is all about explosions, and you figure out new, inventive ways to use this technique as the puzzles demand it from you. It then gets even more interesting when it adds a second bomb. As is often the case with games like this, if that sounds like your jam, I strongly suggest you stop reading now and go buy it. <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2721890/oo/">It’s only $8</a>, and it’s one of my favorite games of the year. The rest of this piece is to convince everyone else of its genius, but also gives the reader a <em>bit</em> more information than I had when I started playing, after completing its stunning demo earlier in the year.</p> <p><iframe loading="lazy" title="Öooo - Official Short Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="about:blank" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen="" data-rocket-lazyload="fitvidscompatible" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/jXQmJBsrciI?feature=oembed"></iframe></p> <p>So, you place a bomb with A (and by default are left sitting on top of it) and explode it with X. Place two bombs and then X will explode each in the order you placed them. Put two on top of each other with you sitting at the top and you’ve got a sort of double-jump. Sit on one while the other blows you sideways…well, this is the sort of stuff you need to figure out.</p>

 <p>When the <a href="https://buried-treasure.org/2025/06/next-fest-june-2025s-buried-treasures/"><em>Öoo </em>demo came out earlier this year</a>, it suggested that a second bomb was something you got very early on in the game, which may have led some to suspect that a third and a fourth would be arriving soon after. I’m rather pleased to report that’s not actually the case, or I suspect what has proven to be one of the most meticulously crafted puzzle-platformers I’ve ever played might have become too woefully complicated. While there’s great appeal in sandbox experimentation with four different bombs exploding in order, to discern the one desired combination for a puzzle solution would have been deeply demoralizing. Sticking to two, but having so much imagination for how they can be used in ever-more interesting ways, demonstrates an awful lot of smarts. In fact, you have just two until the very end of the game, but you’ll never stop learning new ways to use them.</p> <p>And this is the key. If this were a game about getting more and more bomb segments, or even being given fresh new abilities with which they interact, then you’d have something like a traditional Metroidvania. But it isn’t and you aren’t. You get that second bomb about half an hour into the game, and then that’s your lot. So why is it that <em>Öoo</em> still plays like a Metroidvania? Because it’s just so utterly, brilliantly designed.</p> <figure id="attachment_2000616906" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000616906"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000616906">©Nama Takahashi / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p>Almost from the start, you’ll encounter areas you can’t yet reach. You then play on in another direction, with the gradual introduction of increasingly complex puzzles causing you to think more inventively about your tools and how you can use them. At a certain point, rather than being able to carry on any further, you’ll reach a dead end in one of the game’s occasional teleport rooms, and you’re just left with the option to jump back to a part of the map where you can see an incomplete path. It’ll be one of those areas you couldn’t reach yet. Except, well, now you can. Not because you have a new skill, but because now you can think differently about how to approach the puzzle. And I’ve never experienced anything like this before. It’s quite extraordinary!</p>

 <p>Gosh, that was a long and necessary route to make that one point, so let’s move on to what else makes <em>Öoo</em> such a great game. This is a follow-up to developer Nama Takahashi’s&nbsp;<a href="https://kotaku.com/elechead-switch-steam-good-bad-ending-collectibles-1849158240"><em>ElecHead</em></a>, itself a wonderful platform-puzzler, and shares its retro aesthetic, albeit now with a more vibrant color palette. Gorgeous looping animations mean the levels feel buoyant, and Öoo itself is bursting with character, complete with falling asleep and snoring when left idle. And let’s not put aside that the game is called <em>Öoo</em> because that’s exactly what the character looks like.</p> <p>Another hugely important aspect of <em>Öoo</em> is that it has no interest in wasting your time. To solve puzzles you need to experiment, and to do that, you need to take risks. There are a bunch of ways to die, but there’s no significant penalty. Checkpoint flags are everywhere, meaning you’re never forced to mindlessly retrace your steps. The only times you might be more than a screen away are when there’d otherwise not be a means to backtrack–which is to say, everything’s been thought of, and you won’t be infuriatingly trapped. Should you become completely flummoxed by a puzzle, however, Takahashi has recorded <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8PA3w0GnpAo">a video of his completing the entire game</a>, which you can easily scrub to find where you’re currently stuck. At which point you will put your head in your hands and lament your folly for not having figured it out for yourself. Because, as I’ve said, this game gives you everything you need right from the start.</p> <figure id="attachment_2000616907" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000616907"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000616907">©Nama Takahashi / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p>Worry not when you see that walkthrough video is only 45 minutes long. This is the creator of the game, and in real life you’ll be easily spending at least three or four hours before you’ll reach the end credits. And what a splendid few hours it is! This is such a delightful game, and so wonderfully intelligent in its creation.</p> <p><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2721890/oo/"><em>Öoo</em> is out now on PC for $8</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              
              <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/mafia-old-country-reviews-metacritic-roundup-ps5-2000616275"><em>Mafia: The Old Country</em> </a>is set on the island of Sicily. Despite your proximity to the Mediterranean, however, there’s no swimming in the latest, not-quite-open-world gangster game. A clip showing the new blockbuster’s lack of “swimming physics” quickly blew up on social media, spurring a debate about whether <em>The Old Country</em> cuts corners. In actuality, I wish more games were fine with cutting junk that doesn’t matter.</p> <p>Swimming is one of the ways an open-world game proves just how premium and expensive it is. Falling in water meant instant death in <em>Infamous 1</em> and <em>2</em>, while in <em>Second Son</em> it merely returned you to the last hard surface you were standing on. But in <em>Ghost of Tsushima</em>, light swimming mechanics became part of exploring the world. You couldn’t swim in <em>Grand Theft Auto</em> until <em>San Andreas</em>. One of the more controversial aspects of <em>The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild</em> and <em>Tears of the Kingdom</em> games is that, while you can swim on the surface of the water, you can’t dive underneath like in previous games.</p> <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">In case you were wondering, Mafia: The Old Country doesn't have swimming physics just like previous Mafia Games <a href="https://t.co/oUA13X64Q1">pic.twitter.com/oUA13X64Q1</a></p> <p>— NikTek (@NikTekOfficial) <a href="https://twitter.com/NikTekOfficial/status/1953894404588179783?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">August 8, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <p>Swimming was never a thing in the <em>Mafia</em> games <a href="https://kotaku.com/how-the-makers-of-mafia-iii-lost-their-way-1825242177">until <em>Mafia 3</em></a>, which took place in a canal- and swamp-filled version of New Orleans called New Bordeaux. So it might have made sense to expect that to remain part of the feature set in <em>The Old Country</em>. But the new game is also more streamlined, focusing on its characters, missions, and world rather than on the kind of sandbox bloat that can be fun to mess around with but ultimately doesn’t add a ton to the overall experience. <em>The Old Country</em> is $50 and only 12 hours long. To some that’s a raw deal. But for advocates of quicker, cheaper, more sustainable game development, it seems like the perfect antidote to <a href="https://kotaku.com/former-sony-exec-calls-for-shorter-games-that-are-cheap-1844150846">a lot of the big-budget excess</a> that weighs down so many other projects. So, instead of letting you spear fish or dive for treasure, <em>The Old Country</em> warps you back to land anytime you fall in deep water.</p>

 <p>“This reminds me of when we showed <em>BG3</em> to someone (exec or whatever)–a wealth of mechanics–and with zero emotion he just goes ‘can you swim in the game?’ Like bro this isn’t mechanical whack-a-mole, endlessly layering on mechanics maketh a good game not,” Larian Studios publishing director Michael “Cromwelp” Douse <a href="https://x.com/Cromwelp/status/1954131668215693599">wrote on X</a> in response to the debate over <em>Old Country</em>‘s old-school swimming band-aid. “The realities of game design are such that each feature has a cost. Manpower-&gt; time-&gt; budget. ‘Why not just[…]’ can set a producer on fire. Try it, its funny. Better to not swim if you’re not going to do anything with it, than to add it simply to have it.”</p> <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">Engagement baiters show invisible walls and "no swimming" but conveniently they forgot to show areas where the need to swim was thought of, and very obviously decided against. Many other games teleport you back to the shore and no one is complaining. <a href="https://t.co/HRfJiU5ARE">pic.twitter.com/HRfJiU5ARE</a></p> <p>— Silent (@__silent_) <a href="https://twitter.com/__silent_/status/1954547676625641537?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">August 10, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <p>Douse pointed to day-and-night cycles as another example. While occasionally pretty and immersive, most games don’t actually do much with them, like change how characters act at night or what enemies you might face. It’s one of those back-of-the-box bullet points that can get wheeled out in pitch meetings to impress a publisher but can end up leading to more headaches and a less focused game in the long run.</p> <p>“I feel like I’m aging out of the gaming sphere because I see this and ask myself ‘Does this game even need a swimming? Should dev time be devoted to it’ and people in the comments are saying ‘This is unacceptable for a 2025 game’ Idk I just don’t think games need every mechanic,” read <a href="https://x.com/Actually_Tina/status/1954232748044112165">one viral response</a> to the swimming debate from X user ActuallyTina. “I would much rather devs spend time on mechanics that actually engagement the player a lot then a big empty world with nothing in it or swimming that is just there because idk its 2025 and you need swimming.”</p>
