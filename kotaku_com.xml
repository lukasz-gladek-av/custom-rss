And not just live-service multiplayer games either. New sales data shows how over a third of 2024's best selling games, like <em>Elden Ring</em>, came out years ago. </p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="196055" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="6 Things To Know Before Starting Persona 5 Tactica" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="227" data-playlist="196055,195624,196358" data-current="196055"><div><p>6 Things To Know Before Starting Persona 5 Tactica</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196055/196055_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196055/196055_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196055/196055_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196055/196055_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/21584.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://bsky.app/profile/matpiscatella.bsky.social/post/3lgg2dhbzzk2n&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://bsky.app/profile/matpiscatella.bsky.social/post/3lgg2dhbzzk2n" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Market research firm Circana released its list</a></span> of the top-20 best-selling games of 2024 for the U.S. on Thursday, and it shows for just how long some old games are sticking around. Perennial favorites like <em>Grand Theft Auto V</em> (2013) and <em>Minecraft </em>(2011) always show up on these lists, but single-player RPGs like <em>Elden Ring</em> (2022) and <em>Hogwarts Legacy</em> (2023) are now too. In fact if you remove the EA Sports MVP Bundle, which includes <em>Madden 25 </em>and <em>Sports FC 25</em>,  games already on the list elsewhere, then over a third of the top-20 list includes old games:</p><blockquote data-type="BlockQuote"><ol data-type="List" data-style="Number"><li><em>Call of Duty: Black Ops 6</em></li><li><em>EA Sports College Football 25</em></li><li><em>Helldivers II </em></li><li><em>Dragon Ball: Sparking Zero </em></li><li><em>NBA 2K25 </em></li><li><em>Madden NFL 25</em></li><li><strong><em> Call of Duty: Modern Warfare III (2023) </em></strong></li><li><em>EA Sports FC 25 </em></li><li><strong><em>Elden Ring </em></strong></li><li><em>EA Sports MVP Bundle </em></li><li><strong><em>Hogwarts Legacy </em></strong></li><li><em>Dragon’s Dogma II </em></li><li><em>WWE 2K24 </em></li><li><em>MLB: The Show 24 </em></li><li><strong><em>Grand Theft Auto V </em></strong></li><li><strong><em>Minecraft </em></strong></li><li><em>Final Fantasy VII: Rebirth </em></li><li><em>Tekken 8 </em></li><li><strong><em>Marvel’s Spider-Man 2 </em></strong></li><li><strong><em>NBA2K24</em></strong>﻿</li></ol></blockquote><p>It’s hard to come up with any unifying theory of why these seven games (<span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.resetera.com/threads/the-20-best-selling-games-of-2023-in-the-us.816495/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.resetera.com/threads/the-20-best-selling-games-of-2023-in-the-us.816495/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">three more than 2023</a></span>) remained such huge sellers last year. Annual sports games like <em>NBA 2K24</em> and <em>Call of Duty</em>’s unparalleled popularity have historically helped them stick around months after release. <em>GTA V</em> is required to play<em> GTA Online</em>, which continues to be one of the most popular multiplayer games, and the launch of <em>GTA VI </em>is closer than ever. And every year there’s a new generation of kids getting hooked on <em>Minecraft</em>. </p><p><em>Elden Ring</em> was no doubt helped by its GOTY contender expansion,<em> Shadow of the Erdtree</em>, coming out in 2024. And <em>Hogwarts Legacy</em>? Well, who knows. It hit Switch in late 2023 and finally started getting its price slashed in half during recent sales. <em>Spider-Man 2</em>, meanwhile, seems like people’s go-to game when they upgrade to a PS5 for the first time.</p><p>Other notable takeaways from last year’s best-selling games are that not a single Nintendo first-party game charted, a testament to what a week year overall it was for the console despite a late breakout in <em>Mario Party Jamboree</em>. <em>Star Wars Outlaws</em> didn’t chart at all either. In fact a Ubisoft game hasn’t charted in the top 10 since 2020's <em>Assassin’s Creed Valhalla</em>, no doubt part of its calculous in delaying <em>Assassin’s Creed Shadows</em> a second time for extra polish as the family-owned publisher battles for survival. </p><p><em>Dragon Age: The Veilguard</em> was another high-profile absence. In addition to not making the list despite its predecessor eventually selling over 10 million, it wasn’t a top-20 best-selling game for December 2024 either, less than two months after it launched. Publisher EA <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://ir.ea.com/press-releases/press-release-details/2025/Electronic-Arts-Pre-Announces-Preliminary-Q3-FY25-Results/default.aspx&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://ir.ea.com/press-releases/press-release-details/2025/Electronic-Arts-Pre-Announces-Preliminary-Q3-FY25-Results/default.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">released its preliminary financial early pointing</a></span> to the action-RPG coming in severely under expectations with 1.5 million players for the quarter, 50 percent below its forecast. Whether that was an unrealistic goal to make up for the game’s notoriously long and difficult development cycle is another matter. </p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

The hit mobile game is getting a much-needed content refresh later this month in the form of a new set called Space-Time Smackdown. Two separate booster packs will feature Dialga and Palkia on their covers, the legendaries from <em>Pokémon Diamond</em> and <em>Pearl</em>. The set arrives alongside the addition of card trading, a long awaited feature <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/pokemon-tcg-pocket-trading-rules-gold-cards-date-1851741957&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-tcg-pocket-trading-rules-gold-cards-date-1851741957">we also just got some more controversial new details about</a></span>. </p><p>Space-Time Smackdown  goes live January 30. In addition to Dialga and Palkia, the set will feature other Pokémon new to <em>TCG Pocket</em>, including Lucario and Sinnoh region starters Turtwig, Chimchar and Piplup. A trailer for the expansion teased other cards and new illustrations for existing ones as well. There will seemingly be over 140 cards available from the new packs, making Space-Time Smackdown smaller than the <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/pokemon-tcg-pocket-poke-gold-price-1851744809&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-tcg-pocket-poke-gold-price-1851744809">starting Genetic Apex set, but twice the size of the Mythical Island set released in December</a></span>. </p><p>When it comes to trading, which will be added to the game on January 29, we already knew that players would be limited to exchanging cards at 1-star rarity and below. This was already rubbing players the wrong way, since crown rarity cards—like gold Charizard Ex—are the hardest to get and the only ones many diehard fans are still chasing. </p><p>Now, Creatures Inc. and DeNA have revealed the currencies players will need to trade with one another in addition to the rarity restrictions. The development team revealed players will need both trade hourglasses <em>and</em> trade tokens to exchange cards. Given current cooldowns, it certainly seems like this will limit players to just a few trades a week unless they spend money, though we still don’t know if or how <em>TCG Pocket</em>’s premium currency will factor into the new social mechanic. </p><p>Players also won’t be able to trade cards from First Space-Time Smackdown to start with either. The development team previously told fans it was looking at the negative feedback for the trading rules, but it doesn’t seem like it plans to change course anytime soon. </p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
