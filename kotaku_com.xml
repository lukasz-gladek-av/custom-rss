            <link>https://kotaku.com/tp-link-deco-wifi-7-mesh-system-3-pack-falls-to-an-all-time-low-cheaper-than-budget-wifi-6-routers-2000651219</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>If you’re paying for high-speed internet but dealing with dead zones and slow performance in certain areas of your house, your router could be the culprit. An easy solution to actually enjoy the performance promised by your ISP is by investing in a solid mesh system. It works by using the interconnected devices to create a strong network that delivers consistent signals across your entire place.</p>
<p>Now is a great time to pick one up, as<a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6276/"> Amazon is currently offering a sweet 29% discount on the TP-Link Deco BE23 dual-band WiFi 7 mesh system (3-pack), which brings its price down to $178.</a> You can also enjoy free shipping on your purchase if you grab it quick, but the deal is selling out fast. That means you don’t have a lot of time left to bag these savings. It’s better to act sooner rather than later if you want to score the discount before it’s too late.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6276/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Better Coverage Throughout the House</h2>
<p>Deco BE23 uses Wi-Fi 7 technology, paired with Multi-Link Operation (MLO), Multi-RUs, and 4K-QAM to deliver full speeds of up to 2882 Mbps on the 5GHz band and 688 Mbps on the 2.4GHz band with 4 streams. The 3-pack bundle blankets up to 6,500 sq. ft, while the 4x high-gain antennas per node and 4x high-power FEMs push more reliable signals across your home. You can connect up to 150 devices at the same time without compromising on the speeds. Translation? The mesh system is more than capable of delivering the signals you’re paying for in every room and corner around the house – think under the stairs, in the closet, near the balcony, etc. Everyone in the house can connect all their devices, from laptops to smartphones, PC, consoles, tablets, TVs, and more, which is especially great for remote workers and creatives who rely on a bunch of different devices to get through their days. You also won’t have to sit right next to the router to catch signals; the mesh system offers the same performance all around.</p>



<p>Those who need even better performance when working on an important task or gaming with friends can make use of the two 2.5 Gbps WAN/LAN ports that come built right into each Deco unit. This lets you create a multi-gig pipeline from the internet to your devices. Best of all, the system uses AI-Roaming technology to deliver optimal speeds. It continuously adapts through advanced algorithms and learns your patterns over time as you move around. The system also plays nicely with a range of providers, but you might need to purchase a modem to get started. It’s backward compatible with all WiFi generations, so can fit into any existing system nicely.</p>
<p>TP-Link takes security seriously, as the Decos are designed, built, and maintained with advanced security as a core requirement. TP-Link HomeShield offers home network protection, plus access to handy parental controls for a safer internet experience. VPN clients and servers are supported, making it easy to access remote VPN servers without installing VPN software on each device. Setting everything up is quite straightforward, even if it’s your first time putting a mesh system up. It should be up and running in no time.</p>
<p>In short, if you’re done dealing with painfully slow speeds and terrible coverage of your router, now is a great time to upgrade the internet situation in your home. This deal lets you do it without shelling out big bucks.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/bose-extends-its-clearance-push-from-headphones-to-home-speakers-leaving-zero-margin-behind-2000651213</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>If you’re planning to bring family and friends together this holiday season for hearty meals and some much-needed bonding, good music can lift the mood and make your gathering even more enjoyable. Imagine having soft tunes playing in the background as you catch up with your loved ones on Christmas Eve; wholesome.</p>
<p>You just need a good speaker to make this happen, and Amazon is making it easier than ever to pick one. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6275/">The retailer just slashed the Bose SoundLink home speaker by 18%, dropping the price down to $179</a>. The deal applies to both silver and grey color options, so you can pick whichever would fit within the aesthetics of your place the best.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6275/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Bold Sound In a Minimal Design</h2>
<p>Bose has paid attention to the looks with this one. The anodized aluminum paired with a high-quality fabric grille gives off a premium look, while the overall minimal design makes it easy for the speaker to blend into any setup without drawing too much attention to itself. You’ll find all the controls right at the top; no need to go on a scavenger hunt for your phone every time you need to tweak the volume.</p>
<p>The speaker punches well above its weight by delivering crisp, clear sound for all your tracks. It captures all the highs and lows within tunes, and pushes deep bass that can fill any room with good vibes. This makes it not just great for music, but also for your streaming sessions where you don’t want to rely on your laptop or TV’s audio. Dialogues sound clearer than ever, and your favorite songs can be enjoyed to their fullest. Catch up on your favorite podcast in the morning, play the latest Maroon 5 album in the evening, and end the night with an episode of Stranger Things; it takes care of all your audio needs like a pro.</p>



<p>Advanced Bluetooth 5.3 offers solid connection stability and reduced latency. For instance, when the speaker is paired with your phone, you’ll be able to roam around the house comfortably without worrying about audio dropouts, even when things get crowded. Reliability comes from its 9 hours of battery life, which keeps the good vibes going all night long. Best of all, it supports wired connection, too, so you can plug your device in using a USB-C cord when it’s running low; no need to pause the music. There’s also a microphone built right in, which makes it easy to take quick calls right from the speaker or access voice assistants like Alexa.</p>
<p>The sound this speaker delivers is solid on its own, but you can also pair two of these together for a bigger setup, which can be great for entertaining a larger crowd. Linking them together hardly takes a few seconds, and you don’t even need an app to do it.</p>
<p>There’s a lot more to like about this minimal, no-fuss, but efficient speaker. It’s now down to $179, which is still a bit of an investment, but definitely one that’s going to be worth it. To recap, this speaker offers clear sound, deep bass (even at higher volumes), an exceptional battery life, as well as plug-and-play functionality when needed. Place it anywhere you like, and get the part started. We highly recommend grabbing it quick, before the price goes back up to $219.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/tekken-director-bandai-namco-katsuhiro-harada-leaves-2000651368</link>
            <guid>1376035</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><span>Katushiro Harada, veteran poster and the director of the </span><i><span>Tekken</span></i><span> series, has announced he is leaving Bandai Namco after 31 years.</span></p> <p><span>In a lengthy post on his </span><a href="https://x.com/Harada_TEKKEN/status/1997952347709034747"><span>X account</span></a><span>, Harada said that the end of 2025 will see him leave the company, and that with </span><i><span>Tekken </span></i><span>reaching its 30th anniversary last year, right now felt like the “most fitting moment” to bring this chapter of his life to a close. Harada reflected on his “roots,” which involved promoting </span><i><span>Tekken </span></i><span>to players in Japanese arcades; he says that those days immersed in local fighting scenes both in Japan and in community centers overseas “became the core of who [he was] as a developer and game creator.” While reflecting on the past, Harada also said that recent </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/tomonobu-itagaki-death-dead-or-alive-team-ninja-gaiden-2000636025"><span>personal tragedies</span></a><span> and professional movement helped him come to this decision.</span></p> <p><span>“In recent years, I experienced the loss of several close friends in my personal life, and in my professional life, I witnessed the retirement or passing of many senior colleagues whom I deeply respect,” Harada wrote. “Those accumulated events made me reflect on the ‘time I have left as a creator.’ During that period, I sought advice from Ken Kutaragi—whom I respect as though he were another father—and received invaluable encouragement and guidance.</span></p>

 <p><span>His words quietly supported me in making this decision.</span></p> <p><span>Over the past four to five years, I’ve gradually handed over all of my responsibilities, as well as the stories and worldbuilding I oversaw, to the team, bringing me to the present day.”</span></p>

 <p><span>Harada signs off by saying he will still be attending the Tekken World Tour finals in January as a guest, and by dropping an hour-long </span><i><span>Tekken </span></i><span>mix called “Tekken: A 30-Year Journey – Harada’s Final Mix” on </span><a href="https://soundcloud.com/katsuhiro-harada-1/tekken-a-30-year-journey-haradas-final-mix?si=a5c6ead3a5f64c4c9ac47330a8e3f4ed&amp;utm_source=twitter&amp;utm_medium=post&amp;utm_campaign=social_sharing"><span>Soundcloud</span></a><span>.</span></p> <p><span>Harada served as a voice actor in the first two </span><i><span>Tekken </span></i><span>games before stepping up to the director role with </span><i><span>Tekken 3 </span></i><span>in 1997. He’s also worked on other fighting game series, such as </span><i><span>Soulcalibur</span></i><span> and </span><i><span>Pokken Tournament</span></i><span>, and contributed to various other Bandai Namco games as a producer and supervisor. In 2019, Harada became the lead of the company’s overall fighting game esports division, and was promoted to a general manager. </span><i><span>Tekken 8</span></i><span> launched last year </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/tekken-8-review-roundup-1851189539"><span>to high praise</span></a><span> and will be Harada’s final work on the series and at Bandai Namco. Though he doesn’t say what’s next for him, Harada will be remembered both in and out of the </span><i><span>Tekken </span></i><span>community for his candid posting on social media, both </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/tekken-waffle-house-stage-1851378866"><span>in joking with players</span></a><span> and in </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/tekken-8-katsuhiro-harada-twitter-anna-new-characters-1851575150"><span>responding to criticism</span></a><span>. </span></p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/lego-pushes-star-wars-millennium-falcon-to-a-record-low-to-offload-the-last-remaining-stock-before-christmas-2000651151</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Kids will be cleaning up on LEGO sets for the holidays, as they have for decades. But how about LEGO’s adult fans who are just kids at heart, especially the ones who’ve been devout LEGO Star Wars fans for most or all of the years those sets have been sold? Yes, there are deals for them too, perhaps none better than <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4190/">this Amazon sale on the LEGO Star Wars Millennium Falcon A New Hope 25th Anniversary Collectible Model, which is 20% off right now.</a></p>
<p>This intricately detailed, displayable 921-piece commemorative model of the iconic Millennium Falcon is a $68 steal for LEGO Star Wars fans 18 and up. Years after the fun of building the LEGO Falcon, it will likely still be proudly displayed in your home, with its special LEGO Star Wars 25th Anniversary brick identifying it as a collector’s item.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4190/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>All the Details</h2>
<p>The design of the LEGO Star Wars Millennium Falcon includes all of the intricate little details that Star Wars obsessives would insist on, including the ship’s cockpit, satellite dish, and cannons. With 921 pieces creating a model that, when fully assembled, measures 5 by 9.5 by 7.5 inches, there’s a lot of material packed into a relatively small space for all those details.</p>
<p>The LEGO Star Wars Millennium Falcon comes with a display stand that lets you position the ship at dynamic angles for a more attractive look. It’s not a playable model, so keep it out of the hands of the littles, but when it’s standing on its base and angled to look like it’s zooming through space, it’s a true eye-catcher.</p>



<h2>Relaxing and Rewarding</h2>
<p>As much as you will enjoy seeing the Falcon displayed in your home for years to come and having it become a conversation piece with guests, the real enjoyment is, of course, the actual building. Assembling he LEGO Star Wars Millennium Falcon is finely detailed work, allowing you to immerse yourself in the process. Think of the old ship in a bottle models, or the very intricate models requiring glue and paint. The LEGO Star Wars Millennium Falcon requires the same focus, but provides a relaxing experience while being far, far more forgiving of error than those old-school hobbies. And if you really enjoy the building process, they’re LEGOs — you can always take it apart and build it all over again, as many times as you like.</p>
<p>The 25th anniversary of the LEGO Star Wars franchise has birthed a large collectible series of mid-scale buildable models from the Star Wars canon, but perhaps none quite so familiar and iconic to both hardcore fans and casual ones alike as the Millennium Falcon. This kit for builders 18 and up is an amazing present for the Star Wars enthusiast in your life, or for yourself. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4190/">Jump on it now at Amazon while it’s still on sale for $68.</a></p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/bose-quietcomfort-headphones-hold-a-49-off-record-low-now-over-3x-cheaper-than-airpods-max-2000651206</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Good music can make even the most boring tasks somewhat bearable. Listening to some Bruno Mars or Taylor Swift during long commutes or while doing the dishes is a good way to push through them with ease. The market is filled with headphones, and picking the right one can be overwhelming. If you’re after a pair that’s comfortable to wear for long hours, offers multiple listening modes, and doesn’t blow your budget, we have good news.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6274/">The highly rated Bose QuietComfort wireless headphones are going for just $179 at Amazon, after the retailer slashed a whopping 49% off their retail price.</a> You’re saving a massive $170 on a premium pair, and this deal applies to the stunning Standstone color option. Not your vibe? Several other options are discounted, too, including black, gray, lilac, and pink. Those who prefer their audio gear to be on the minimal side should grab the black version. If a pop of color is what you like, consider going for the blue pair. Both of these are sitting at $199, after dropping from $349. The discount is open to both Prime and non-Prime members, and there are no delivery charges to worry about. You also don’t need to add any long coupon codes or follow complicated processes to score the drop. Just click Add to cart, and proceed with checkout at the discounted rate.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6274/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Superior Sound</h2>
<p>These are made for extended use. That’s thanks to a comfortable padded band paired with plush over-ear cushions that hug your ears softly for a secure, snuggly fit. The band keeps them in place, even when you’re taking a walk, jogging around, or trying to get a workout in with some energetic music to keep you going.</p>
<p>There are two listening modes to choose from; Quiet and Aware. The quiet mode blocks all the external noise, offering an immersive listening experience with no distractions. It’s great for when you want to focus on a task and don’t want background chatter and noise impacting your flow (or chain of thoughts) negatively. Aware mode, on the other hand, keeps you..well, aware of your surroundings. It lets some sounds in, making it easy to stay in the loop on what’s happening around you. You’ll be able to have conversations with this on, hear when the barista calls your name, etc. This mode is great for when you’re in a public area and can’t afford zoning out completely. Adjustable EQ makes it easy to tweak audio settings based on what you like, so you’ll always enjoy a custom listening experience.</p>



<p>The headphones offer up to 24 hours of battery on a single charge, which is more than enough to go at least a couple of days without worrying about plugging them in. Plus, when running low, a quick 15-minute charge via USB-C gives you an additional 2.5 hours of jamming; perfect for when you’re on the go and don’t have the time to power them up completely. Even better, these support wired connectivity just as well, so you also have the option to use them with the included audio cable, too, which works even when you’re out of battery. It’s best to use the pair with the dedicated Bose app to enjoy the latest features and adjust settings.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6274/">Amazon is letting you grab these for just $179 now, making the upgrade quite affordable.</a> You’re saving 49% on a top-rated option, plus there are several color options to choose from, which makes it easy to choose the one that fits your aesthetics the best. But again, grab it quickly, as once the deal is gone, it likely won’t come back anytime soon.</p>

              <p>Laptop upgrades don’t always have to break the bank. Even though Black Friday and Cyber Monday are long gone, there are ways to bag some massive discounts on items across a range of categories, including laptops.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6273/">Gamers and creatives looking to upgrade their everyday machine should consider grabbing the 15-inch Lenovo IdeaPad Slim 3, which is currently available at a whopping 65% discount at Amazon.</a> It would run you around $2,000 on a regular day, but you can grab it today for just $700. That’s similar to what most entry-level options cost these days. This is also the lowest we have seen the laptop drop to in a while, and the deal is available to all shoppers, whether you’re a Prime member or not. Note that the retailer has listed the discount as a limited-time one, so it’s best to grab it fast. Deals such as this one tend to wrap up quickly, and we’re expecting Amazon to push the price back up any moment now.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6273/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Ideal for Gamers and Creatives</h2>
<p>IdeaPads are sleek powerhouses. This one, in particular, comes with a full-sized keyboard with a dedicated numeric keypad; comfortable to type longer documents with ease. It’s not backlit, but the keyboard is paired with a bright display that lets you work in any lighting. The 15.3-inch WUXGA IPS screen delivers a brilliant 1920×1200 resolution to bring all your favorite content to life in vibrant detail. The 300 nits of brightness take care of the visibility, while the anti-glare coating makes sure the display is easy on the eyes, whether you’re using it in a dimly lit room or out there in the sun.</p>
<p>There’s also a 720p HD camera with a privacy shutter included, plus digital microphones for better video calls. Audio is taken care of by the built-in dual 2W speakers, meaning you won’t just enjoy stunning visuals, but enjoy better sound for whatever’s playing on the screen, too. Additionally, the battery life is impressive. You can expect it to last a full day for lighter tasks (browsing, streaming), while around 2-4 hours for heavier tasks. When running low, the Rapid Charge Boost gets the machine back up and running in no time. You’ll get an extra 2 hours of usage with just a quick 15-minute top-up.</p>



<p>As for the power, Slim 3 runs on the 6-core AMD Ryzen 5 7535HS processor, which smartly combines portability and durability, letting you be productive (plus game) on the go. The 24GB DDR5 SDRAM memory keeps things running smoothly, even during demanding days, which is especially great for multitaskers. You’ll be able to perform a bunch of tasks at the same time without slowing down, whether it’s using different apps simultaneously, gaming with friends, trying to hit deadlines in a short period of time, getting feedback on your creative tasks, using multiple windows side-by-side, and more.</p>
<p>The built-in 1TB PCIe NVMe SSD makes it just as easy to store all your important stuff in a single place. The laptop can house most of your important media files, work documents, creative projects, and programs without a problem. Of course, it’s not massive enough to store entire game libraries, but should be sufficient for casual use. Connectivity options include Wi-Fi 6, Bluetooth 5.3, plus a wide range of ports to connect peripherals.</p>
<p>All things considered, we recommend the laptop for casual gamers, creatives, work professionals, and even students. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6273/">It’s now down to just $700, which is quite affordable considering all the features you’re getting with this one.</a></p>

              <p data-start="157" data-end="888">Black Friday and Cyber Monday may have come and gone, but that doesn’t mean all the best discounts have disappeared with them. In fact, one of the strongest lingering deals right now is on the Apple AirPods 4. Even though these earbuds are just over a year old, they’re getting a surprisingly steep price cut—making this an ideal moment to grab a pair if you’ve been waiting for a sale. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6034/">The ANC-enabled AirPods 4 launched at $179, but Amazon currently has them marked down 45%, bringing the price to just $99</a>. That’s a staggering $80 off the original cost. If you prefer add on AppleCare+, the version packed with Apple’s coverage is also discounted down to just $118 (down from $208).</p>
<p data-start="890" data-end="1292">AirPods have been a staple in Apple’s lineup for years, and each generation sees subtle but meaningful refinements. The newest AirPods 4 introduce a sleeker shape with a shorter stem and intuitive quick-press controls for managing your audio. Apple has put an emphasis on all-day comfort in this redesign, aiming to make them easier to wear for longer stretches—whether you’re commuting, working, or relaxing.</p>

<h2 data-start="1294" data-end="1311">Isolate Sound</h2>
<p data-start="1313" data-end="1686">One of the biggest upgrades comes from Apple’s H2 chip, which significantly improves call quality. The chip enables advanced voice isolation that filters out background noise, ensuring the person on the other end hears you clearly, even in loud or crowded environments. Instead of competing with chatter, engine noise, or street sounds, your voice remains front and center.</p>
<p data-start="1688" data-end="1970">That same H2 chip enhances your listening experience as well. Apple’s updated acoustic architecture is designed to deliver richer audio, offering detailed highs and deeper bass for music, podcasts, and videos. The improvements make everyday listening feel more dynamic and polished.</p>
<p data-start="1688" data-end="1970">With active noise cancellation, you can reduce unwanted background noise so you can focus solely on your entertainment or phone call. The H2 chip allows the AirPods 4 to blend together ANC and Transparency Mode. If you start speaking with someone nearby, the AirPods 4 can automatically adjust the volume of what’s playing so you can hold a conversation.</p>


<p data-start="1972" data-end="2365">Another enhancement is the new interaction capabilities with Siri—Apple’s voice assistant. The AirPods 4 can interpret simple head gestures like nodding yes or shaking your head noas responses to Siri’s questions. It’s a futuristic touch, though I’m not sure which is weirder. Someone sitting across from you seeing you blankly nodding and shaking your head, or deadpan whispering “yes” or “no” to seemingly nobody.</p>
<p data-start="2367" data-end="2703">One immediately noticeable change from the previous generation is the charging port. Apple has finally moved away from the proprietary Lightning connector. The AirPods 4 charging case now uses USB-C, aligning with the broader industry standard and making charging more convenient if you already have USB-C cables for your other devices.</p>
<p data-start="2705" data-end="2995" data-is-last-node="" data-is-only-node=""><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6034/">With Black Friday and Cyber Monday now behind us, it is a pleasant surprise to see a deal this strong still available—especially on a newer Apple product.</a> If you’ve been thinking about upgrading your earbuds, the ongoing discount on the AirPods 4 is worth taking advantage of while it lasts.</p>
