MCU boss Kevin Feige has described the forthcoming abandoning of interweaving timelines as a “reset.” But definitely not a “reboot.”</p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="197589" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="Ring Psychology: Understanding The 6 Phases Of A Wrestling Match Through Heel Era John Cena" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="659" data-playlist="197589,197586,197585" data-current="197589"><div><p>Ring Psychology: Understanding The 6 Phases Of A Wrestling Match Through Heel Era John Cena</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197589/197589_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197589/197589_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197589/197589_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/23110.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>This is all centered around the proper arrival, in about three years’ time, of the X-Men into the MCU, an arrival which we’ve now learned will <em>not</em> feature any of the recent spate of former <em>X-Men</em> actors whose cameos have littered the latest movies and TV shows. So while it will be the old guard of mutants who show up for 2027's <em>Avengers: Secret Wars</em>, after that they’re off. Instead, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://variety.com/2025/film/news/marvel-x-men-recasting-secret-wars-1236465269/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://variety.com/2025/film/news/marvel-x-men-recasting-secret-wars-1236465269/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">according to <em>Variety</em></a></span>, the 2028-or-later <em>X-Men</em> movie to be directed by Jake Schreier (who also directed <em>Thunderbolts*</em>) will feature an all-new cast playing the iconic comic book heroes. And that might stretch even further, to new actors playing long-established superheroes in the MCU mythos, too. I say: thank you, <em>thank you</em>.</p><figure id="" data-id="c4c20463ad643f7ad9a651dc651a5fb0" data-recommend-id="image://c4c20463ad643f7ad9a651dc651a5fb0" data-format="jpg" data-width="1000" data-height="562" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="BTS footage from the latest Captain America." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="BTS footage from the latest Captain America." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Marvel</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="c4c20463ad643f7ad9a651dc651a5fb0" data-recommend-id="image://c4c20463ad643f7ad9a651dc651a5fb0" data-format="jpg" data-width="1000" data-height="562" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="BTS footage from the latest Captain America." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>OK, bear with me. Phases 4, 5 and 6 of the MCU have been called The Multiverse Saga, and have involved multiple versions of reality crashing into one another. This has taken place across Disney+ TV series like <em>Loki</em>, and movies like <em>Spider-Man: No Way Home</em> and <em>Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness </em>and <em>Deadpool &amp; Wolverine</em>, and has led to the brief appearances of a whole bunch of actors who played X-Men characters in the previous Fox-created franchise of movies that ran from 2000 to 2019.</p><p> In 2017, Disney bought Fox, which allowed decades of licensing conflicts to go away, freeing up familiar mutants to show up in MCU movies, but it’s all been so incredibly piecemeal that it’s been tough to follow. This, we’re told, is all building up to the end of Phase 6, a pair of <em>Avengers</em> movies—<em>Doomsday</em> and <em>Secret Wars</em>—that will finally close the multiverse saga and let us all move on.</p><p>See, so much of the trouble with the current era of the MCU is that even trying to write out what’s happening is a nightmare of overlapping movies, TV series and references to entire other franchises from the past. No wonder audiences are tiring of the films, given the amount of background research you need to do to have the faintest idea what’s going on. </p><p>Yes, it’s absolutely led to the fantastic fun of films like the aforementioned <em>Spider-Man </em>and <em>Doctor Strange </em>outings, but it’s the consequences of these movies that are such a headache. The thrill of characters from multiple universes and franchises meeting up on screen is great while you’re sat in your seat, but needing to remember who was in which and why for next time isn’t what going to the movie theater should be about. Thankfully, there’s only two years of it left.</p><figure id="" data-id="117d4d03b2067abd25ed0ab502f16716" data-recommend-id="image://117d4d03b2067abd25ed0ab502f16716" data-format="jpg" data-width="1000" data-height="562" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="BTS pic from Deadpool &amp; Wolverine." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="BTS pic from Deadpool &amp; Wolverine." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Marvel</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="117d4d03b2067abd25ed0ab502f16716" data-recommend-id="image://117d4d03b2067abd25ed0ab502f16716" data-format="jpg" data-width="1000" data-height="562" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="BTS pic from Deadpool &amp; Wolverine." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>After that, in what has yet to be called Phase 7, Feige is promising that the MCU will match the move made by the comics in 2015's papery version of Secret Wars, and collapse all these bloody timelines into one. In this process, we’ll say goodbye to the likes of Kelsey Grammer, Patrick Stewart, Ian McKellen, Rebecca Romijn and James Marsden, who will presumably be cast off into the ether, and we’ll get a completely new, fresh team of X-Men actors.</p><p>“We’re utilizing [<em>Secret Wars</em>] not just to round out the stories we’ve been telling post-<em>Endgame</em>,” Feige said at a press briefing this weekend, “[but] it very, very much sets us up for the future.” <em>Endgame</em>, the final movie in Phase 3, was about endings, he said, adding, “<em>Secret Wars</em> is about beginnings.”</p><p>When asked if this is a reboot, Feige was very careful to distance himself from the concept. “Reboot is a scary word,” he told reporters. “Reboot can mean a lot of things to a lot of people. Reset, singular timeline—were thinking along those lines.”</p><p>Feige will want to avoid the notion of “reboot” because it would suggest scrapping all that’s come before and starting fresh, which isn’t the plan. It seems it’s more about, as he says, a reset: letting things calm back down before introducing the superheroic world to mutants. This, he notes, should give the movies a chance to also dramatically lower the age of their casts.</p><p>Remember, the MCU began in 2008, a frightening 17 years ago, meaning what were once fresh-faced actors are now very much middle-aged. In order not to age out, the movies will quickly need a younger audience, and since <em>X-Men</em> stories lend themselves to teenage and 20-something characters discovering their powers, this is a great chance to hire some of the most audience-attracting younger actors working today, who would have been very young indeed when the first <em>Iron Man</em> was released.</p><p>According to Feige, this recasting isn’t going to stop at the <em>X-Men</em>. He even suggested—while referencing James Bond as evidence that it’s possible—that characters like Tony Stark and Steve Rogers could be recast. And, as weird and unlikely as that might sound, if the movies are to continue on for generations, it’s unavoidable.</p><figure id="" data-id="56c2db963dd9788d74f26f86cc2ae082" data-recommend-id="image://56c2db963dd9788d74f26f86cc2ae082" data-format="jpg" data-width="895" data-height="504" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Lots of Marvel comic heroes attacking Godzilla." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Lots of Marvel comic heroes attacking Godzilla." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Marvel</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="56c2db963dd9788d74f26f86cc2ae082" data-recommend-id="image://56c2db963dd9788d74f26f86cc2ae082" data-format="jpg" data-width="895" data-height="504" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Lots of Marvel comic heroes attacking Godzilla." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Sure, Marvel comics have a squillion heroes that the MCU has never gone near. The issue is, few have  broad enough recognition to hold up a movie, and as <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/superman-james-gunn-opening-weekend-box-office-1851786190&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/superman-james-gunn-opening-weekend-box-office-1851786190">James Gunn is about to discover in the DCU</a></span>, you have to do a hell of a lot of work to convince an audience to show up for a superhero they’ve never seen on a t-shirt. On the other hand, if you stick to the big names, you can’t have your core characters played by men in their 50s and 60s. Robert Downey Jr. just turned 60. Mark Ruffalo (Hulk) is 57. Jeremy Renner (Hawkeye) is 54. Even the babies like Chris Evans and Chris Hemsworth are now in their 40s. And yes, of course I’d love to see the MCU’s equivalent of <em>The Watchmen</em>, but the reality is that if you want to keep banking on these most popular heroes, you’ll have to recast the roles.</p><p>This could suggest some <em>really</em> dramatic implications for the climax of <em>Secret Wars</em>. It’s obvious to assume that this “reset” would bring us back to what we already know, the Earth-616 where we started before it all got out of control. But what if that’s not the plan? What if the timeline that survives is a completely fresh one, perhaps the one in which this month’s <em>Fantastic Four: First Steps</em> is set? Or an entirely new Earth, which has never seen a Robert Downey Jr. Iron Man or Chris Hemsworth Thor?</p><p>I’d take it. While that’s a lot closer to a “reboot,” and those can be exhausting too (we all have to do the mental gymnastics of already knowing everything while the characters know nothing), it’d be so great not having to try to remember 20 years of backstory, including which character cameoed in which episode of a TV series five years earlier in order to understand why that woman wants to kill that guy in this movie...Yeah, I’ll take a reset.</p><p>.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://kotaku.com/marvel-mcu-x-men-movies-multiverse-phase-6-avengers-1851786617]]></content:encoded>

Earlier this year, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.404media.co/fansly-ban-furries-new-rules/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.404media.co/fansly-ban-furries-new-rules/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Fansly banned any sexualized “anthropomorphic content”</a></span> in an apparent bid to censor bestiality on the platform, despite that being condemned within the furry community as well. Instead of nuanced moderation, some platforms appear to be making more drastic shifts to appease payment companies.</p><p>That’s the concern around the recent purge of sex games on Steam. In addition to bans on games that use crypto currencies or feature “sexually explicit images of real people,” Valve added the much more ambiguous restriction against “Content that may violate the rules and standards set forth by Steam’s payment processors and related card networks and banks, or internet network providers. In particular, certain kinds of adult only content.”</p><p>The new guideline coincided with Vavle removing games from Steam with titles like <em>Incest Tales: Webcam Daughter</em> and <em>Reincarnation in another world going to rape All NPCs VR.</em> But others with genre tags that still mentioned things like incest were left untouched, spreading confusion about where exactly Valve was drawing the line. It was also unclear why Valve was only taking action now despite this type of porn-slop, including some truly vile sounding games, have routinely crept onto the storefront. Instead of Valve banning a sexual assault sim called <em>No Mercy</em> earlier this year, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/no-mercy-sexual-assault-incest-sim-steam-removed-uk-pc-1851775725&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/no-mercy-sexual-assault-incest-sim-steam-removed-uk-pc-1851775725">it was voluntarily withdrawn</a></span> from Steam by its creators.</p><figure id="" data-id="70e31955596f463b5ce3ab176f0a5ea1" data-recommend-id="image://70e31955596f463b5ce3ab176f0a5ea1" data-format="png" data-width="1533" data-height="818" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A screenshot shows an explicit game bundle on Steam.

Does it review games for infringing content first? Does it ban things based on how they look or sound and then wait for the creators to appeal later? And is it working off of clear guidelines from payment companies? It’s that type of moderation mess that risks censoring various game-based works of art simply because someone in a position of power might go “ick,” or, even worse, they saw someone making noise about it on social media and didn’t want to get caught up in the drama.</p><p>That’s certainly the approach that the owners of <em>Vice</em>, which originally broke the story on Collective Shout’s relationship to the changes, appears to have taken. Savage Ventures, which invested in Vice after it went bankrupt, was accused by Valens of being behind the removal of two of her articles about the topic. “Vice’s owner Savage Ventures has requested the removal of my Collective Shout articles,” she posted on <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://bsky.app/profile/acvalens.net/post/3lufjdqmhxs2v&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://bsky.app/profile/acvalens.net/post/3lufjdqmhxs2v" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Bluesky over the weekend</a></span>. “This is due to concerns about the controversial subject matter—not journalistic complaints.”</p><p>In the meantime, Collective Shout cofounder Melinda Tankard Reist <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://x.com/MelTankardReist/status/1946147654616104963&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://x.com/MelTankardReist/status/1946147654616104963" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">is calling</a></span> those critical of Valve’s decision “porn sick brain rotted pedo gamer fetishists.” While the organization’s initial letter accused Steam of hosting hundreds of games that would “breach Australian classification laws,” Collective Shout has so far declined to name any specific examples. “Most of the content found within the games, including the graphics and the developers descriptions, are too distressing for us to make public,” it wrote. </p><p>.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://kotaku.com/steam-sex-censorship-hentai-gta-5-collective-shout-1851786636]]></content:encoded>
