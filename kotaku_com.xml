              <p>You don’t always have to buy new. The latest and greatest will work wonderfully, but you might be wasting your money depending on your exact needs. When it comes to laptops, for instance, maybe a nearly decade-old MacBook Air will suite you just fine. This Apple laptop originally from 2017 has been refurbished and presents a significantly cheaper option than buying new. This model first launched with a price tag of $999. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4468/">Since you waited all this time and decided to buy second-hand, you now only have to pay $180. That amounts to a savings of over $800.</a></p>
<p>Now I’m not going to pretend this product is right for everybody. In 9 out of 10 cases, you’re probably better off buying the latest model MacBook Air, new — or, at the very least, buying one that’s just a couple years old at this point. If you plan on doing any kind of intensive workflows whether that’s video and photo editing or playing games, this 2017 MacBook Air will leave a lot to be desired. However, if you really just need a knockaround laptop for some easy web browsing, email sending, or word processing, this refurbished artifact from the President’s first term might fit the bill.</p>

              <p>We’re just days away from Big Prime Deals Day over at Amazon. This is a multi-day sales event put on during the slower purchasing months to help kickstart some sales. That means if you’ve been patient, waiting for the right moment to buy that espresso maker or bidet you’d been eyeing, next week on October 7 and October 9 might be the best time to pull the trigger. And yet, even though it’s not officially here yet, some items have already begun dropping in price. Take this mini PC for example. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4467/">You can get the AceMagic mini PC right now for 25% off. It’s normally going for $200, so you’ll save a good $50 as it comes to just $150 for a limited time.</a></p>

<h2>Why Get a Mini?</h2>
<p>If you don’t have that large of a living space, like if you live with roommates or just have&nbsp; one bedroom or studio in an expensive city, you probably consider what little space you have to be precious. You may not want to take up your entire desk with a massive PC tower. A mini PC offers versatility while keeping the footprint small.</p>
<p>Lots of modern TVs already have built-in smart features, allowing you to download app like Netflix and Hulu directly to them. And if your happens not to be one of those, streaming sticks like the Fire TV and Roku are pretty cheap to come by. That all may be the case, but there are still reason to power your home theater with a mini PC instead. They are full-on Windows devices after all. That means you’d have a wider range of compatibility, playing various video formats and even playing locally saved media. And the small form factor is easy enough to keep hidden behind your TV or within its stand.</p>
<p>Mini PCs also make for wonderful PLEX servers which means you can access your media files anywhere you are. Some gamers tend to flock toward mini PCs are they are the perfect emulation machine for retro games given the minimal amount of processing power they require. Now if you are choosing to do that, be sure it’s only for storing ROMs of games you already happen to legally own. I won’t be personally checking, so you don’t have to pinky swear me anything.</p>
