In theory, nothing would stop players from creating a third-party marketplace on a subreddit or Discord server where people who have tons of duplicates sell them to the highest bidders. </p><p>That’s possibly one reason why the development team is restricting <em>Pokémon TCG Pocket</em>’s trading feature to one-star cards and below. The rarest cards, like specific gold variants <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/pokemon-tcg-pocket-poke-gold-price-1851744809&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-tcg-pocket-poke-gold-price-1851744809">with only a .053 percent chance of dropping</a></span>, will remain locked to players accounts. They would still be able to sell entire accounts to one another, but that would sort of defeat the whole purpose of playing the game and collecting cards in the first place.</p><p>Of course, all of this is violates <em>Pokémon TCG Pocket</em>’s rules, but that’s never been enough to completely stamp out cheating and other illicit practices in other economy-driven live-service games like <em>Diablo IV</em>. The proof will be in how many players <em>Pokémon TCG Pocket</em> potentially ends up banning for this sort of thing, and if it publicizes those numbers as has become common across lots of other online games. </p><p>The <em>Pokémon Diamond</em> and <em>Pearl</em>-inspired set Space-Time Smackdown arrives this week, alongside the new trading feature, but those cards will also be excluded from trades at launch. Creatures Inc. and DeNA have said exchanging cards with friends will only be available for existing the Genetic Apex and Mythical Island sets at the moment.</p><p>.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
