But one thing that doesn’t appear to be in question is star Jack Black’s commitment to the bit. He plays the crafting game’s iconic blue-shirted normie Steve, and apparently spent lots of time actually playing <em>Minecraft</em> in his trailer during filming. <br></p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="197298" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="Live Forever in the Universe of 'New World: Aeternum'" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="108" data-playlist="197298,197284,197260" data-current="197298"><div><p>Live Forever in the Universe of 'New World: Aeternum'</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197298/197298_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197298/197298_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197298/197298_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197298/197298_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"></video></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p> “This is not my Steve or your Steve—this is Jack Black’s Steve,” Mojang senior director of original content  Torfi Frans Ólafsson <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://variety.com/2025/film/news/a-minecraft-movie-game-microsoft-1236341672/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://variety.com/2025/film/news/a-minecraft-movie-game-microsoft-1236341672/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">recently told<em> Variety</em></a></span>. “A lot of fans responded when they saw the first teasers and trailers, like, ‘Hey, wait a minute—this is just Jack Black. This isn’t Jack Black being someone else.’ And maybe it is, because this is literally him interpreting this character and what it means to him.”</p><p> Ólafsson said he installed Xboxes in each of the cast members’ trailers and set up a private server for them to play together on.

He eventually racked up over 100 hours of playtime in the pixelated 3D survival sim.
