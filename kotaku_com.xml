              <p>It can be such a pain to run out of battery, whether that’s on your phone, computer, or otherwise. If you find yourself in that predicament more often than is practical, you should have a portable charger to help make sure you’re juiced up whenever you need to be.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5984/">The Anker Prime Charger, 160W is up for grabs at Amazon for a limited time at a discounted price of $105.99 compared to its original retail price of $150.</a> That’s a discount of $44.01, or about 29% off.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5984/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>A powerful yet compact portable charger</h2>
<p>This is a powerful and compact portable charger that lets you charge several electronic devices simultaneously. That makes it a great pick for cell phones, tablets, game consoles, and more. It provides up to 160W of power through each of its USB-C ports, so it can safely and rapidly fast-charge a USB-C laptop while charging two additional devices (phone and/or tablet) at the same time.</p>
<p>The USB-C ports are ideal for providing high-power charging to newer laptops, tablets and smartphones, while the USB-A ports are ideal for charging older phones, Bluetooth speakers and/or other smaller electronic devices. Additionally, the Anker Prime Charger has Power Delivery (PD) capability, enabling it to supply power to your electronic devices at the fastest possible rate, allowing you to charge your devices quicker and more efficiently.</p>



<p>Although the Anker Prime Charger has the potential to deliver a significant amount of power, it’s still super small. You can put it on a desktop surface, nightstand, or kitchen counter without taking up too much valuable real estate. It’s also super lightweight and easily storable in a backpack or travel case, making it ideal for use during business trips, vacations, or work-from-home/coworking days, when users would prefer a single charger to replace a tangled mess of individual chargers and cables.</p>
<p>Built-in safety features enable you to feel confident when connecting expensive electronic devices. The Anker Prime Charger constantly monitors temperature and power consumption to ensure that it protects against heat damage (overheating), excessive voltage, and/or electrical shock due to short circuit conditions. Although these protective mechanisms operate transparently, they offer considerable peace-of-mind benefits when you need to charge multiple high-value devices at the same time.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5984/">This Anker Prime Charger is absolutely perfect for its size, capacity, and performance.</a> It eliminates clutter, enables fast-charging capabilities for newer devices, and is compatible with both home and travel-based environments. Bottom line? You should get one and keep it in your bag, car, or somewhere else that you use often in case of emergencies. You never know when you might get struck with a charging emergency.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[I’m Begging For A Sequel After Final Fantasy Tactics: The Ivalice Chronicles Ships 1 Million Copies]]></title>
            <link>https://kotaku.com/final-fantasy-tactics-ivalice-remaster-sales-sequel-2000657141</link>
            <guid>1398481</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>How many more copies does <em>Final Fantasy Tactics: The Ivalice Chronicles</em> need to sell before Square Enix greenlights a new grid-based strategy RPG? Almost three years later, physical versions of<em> Hi-Fi Rush</em> are finally up for pre-order. And how long will it take for Netflix to turn <em>Arc Raiders</em> into its next streaming hit?</p> <p>It’s the latest edition of Morning Checkpoint, <em>Kotaku</em>‘s daily roundup of gaming news and culture. Depending on what you’re into, January will probably feel like a slow month for big new game releases, at least compared to last year. But I’m getting lowkey hyped for <a href="https://kotaku.com/code-vein-is-the-chillest-dark-souls-clone-1838481190"><em>Code Vein 2</em></a>, the follow-up to the messy 2019 action-RPG anime soulslike. This one <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJLfjZd78hw">has a motorcycle</a>.</p>

 <h2>Even<em> Final Fantasy Tactics</em>‘ original director can’t believe how well the remaster is selling</h2> <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">I underestimated the sales figures by too much.😂😂😂</p> <p>— 松野泰己🐈‍⬛ (@YasumiMatsuno) <a href="https://twitter.com/YasumiMatsuno/status/2008464271731257715?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 6, 2026</a></p></blockquote>  <p>Square Enix revealed that<em> Final Fantasy Tactics: The Ivalice Chronicles</em> has sold over 1 million copies. That might be “below expectations” for the infamously disappointed Japanese publisher, but it was enough to take Yasumi Matsuno by surprise. It also prompted a fresh message to fans from the remaster’s director.</p>

 <p>“The entire development team is not only grateful to you, but, in order to spread the joy, create a better experience, and encourage more people to play, we are looking at updating the game in the future!” Kazutoyo Maehiro wrote, according to a translation <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/strategy/og-final-fantasy-tactics-director-admits-he-underestimated-how-popular-the-ivalice-chronicles-would-be-as-it-passes-1-million-copies-sold-with-the-remakes-lead-teasing-future-updates/">from <em>Gamesradar</em></a>. What does updating the game in the future entail, exactly? Could the missing War of the Lions content be officially restored? Could we get fresh end-game modes?</p>

 <p>“Our first and foremost goal here really was to recreate the original game,” Maehiro&nbsp;<a href="https://kotaku.com/final-fantasy-tactics-ivalice-remaster-cloud-wiegraf-cid-sequel-2000622717">told<em>&nbsp;Wired</em></a> last year. “If [<em>The Ivalice Chronicles</em>] were to become a success,” he continued, “I do feel that that would then lead to discussions around potentially bringing out sequels, for example, or newer tactical RPGs.”</p>

 <p>Let the <em>Final Fantasy Tactics 2</em> summoning circle commence.</p> <h2>You can finally pre-order a physical copy of <em>Hi-Fi Rush</em></h2> <p>The 2023 GOTY contender from Tango Gameworks, a studio that Microsoft closed in 2024 but which was later re-opened under Krafton, is finally getting a physical version that you can start pre-ordering <a href="https://x.com/LimitedRunGames/status/2008192175138299918">from Limited Run Games on January 23</a>. That includes a PS5 version. This is one game everyone should have in their collection, even if it could still be a year before it actually starts shipping.</p>

 <h2>We could end up getting an<em> Arc Raiders</em> TV show</h2> <p>Embark studio head Patrick Söderlund <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vY3u7wOmm4w">told <em>GamesBeat</em></a> that Hollywood is interested and so is he. “We [wouldn’t] mind doing that. It would be fun, but it needs to be done in the right way. I hope that we will do that. I think the IP fits quite well with something like that.” Nothing is set in stone yet, however, and Embark doesn’t “have anyone working on a TV or film adaptation yet.” Maybe we’ll see it on Netflix in time for <em>Arc Raiders 2</em>.</p>

 <h2><em>Game of Thrones</em> star Sophie Turner was fine with her ending</h2> <p>She acknowledges that the rest of the cast was disappointed with their characters’ fates. “But I feel that I was very happy with the way Sansa ended her story in <em>Game of Thrones</em>, and no one else was really happy with their ending,” Turner <a href="https://thedirect.com/article/sophie-turner-game-of-thrones-sequel-return">told <em>The Direct</em></a><em>.</em> “I feel like I got a good one, and so I don’t know if I could revisit it.” Would she come back to do more <em>Game of Thrones</em>? “Show me the money,” she joked. She might be <a href="https://kotaku.com/tomb-raider-lara-croft-amazon-sophie-turner-2000623124">too busy with</a>&nbsp;<em>Tomb Raider</em> anyway.</p> <h2><em>Final Fantasy 9</em>‘s character artist says goodbye</h2> <p>Toshiyuki Itahana left Square Enix at the end of last year. “Last year marked a major milestone with the 25th anniversary of FINAL FANTASY IX, a truly significant event, and I was deeply grateful to see so many people celebrating FFIX,” he <a href="https://note.com/itahana/n/n277aa9cc7148?sub_rt=share_pb">wrote</a> in a message to fans. He’ll continue to produce art as a freelance illustrator.</p> <h2>ICYMI:</h2> <ul> <li><a href="https://kotaku.com/mudang-two-hearts-splinter-cell-layoffs-shut-down-release-date-2000656736">The Korean <em>Splinter Cell</em> revealed at last year’s Xbox summer showcase could be in trouble</a></li> <li><a href="https://kotaku.com/guy-behind-viral-focus-m-gaming-meme-never-expected-it-to-spread-so-fast-2000656706">The guy behind the viral AAA <em>Mario</em> meme is as surprised as you are</a></li> <li><a href="https://kotaku.com/stranger-things-secret-finale-conformity-gate-explained-2000656704"><em>Stranger Things</em> fans need to let go</a></li> </ul> <h2>Watch this:</h2>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/amazon-practically-gives-away-the-kindle-colorsoft-to-clear-out-last-years-remaining-e-reader-stock-2000657124</link>
            <guid>1398442</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Looking to get back into reading in 2026, or just read more? Welcome to the club.</p>
<p>I love my paperbacks, but over time, I have realized how much more convenient digital copies are for reading on the go. You also get more variety, instead of feeling stuck with that one book you grabbed in a hurry and aren’t really in the mood for anymore – coming from someone who often picks a classic when all that the brain needs is some Murakami.</p>
<p>If you’re not a fan of reading on your phone or tablet, a Kindle can be an excellent investment. There are multiple versions available, but right now, <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5794/">Amazon is offering a chance to pick the latest Kindle Colorsoft at a nice 20% discount, for just $200.</a> You’re saving a sweet $50 on a reading solution that makes it easy to have all your favorite titles accessible at all times, wherever you go. Note that this deal ends soon, so it’s best to get your orders in as soon as you can.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5794/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Keep All Your Favorite Titles Close</h2>
<p>For $200, you’re getting a modest 7-inch, high-contrast Colorsoft display that’s easy on the eyes. Unlike the Kindle Paperwhite display, which is optimized for black and white reading, this version brings all the colors to life. It’s great for stories that include illustrations and maps – think The Hobbit, The Lord of the Rings, and The Wheel of Time – plus comics where color really enhances the overall experience. You can even highlight your favorite scenes in yellow, orange, blue, or pink, and come back to revisit the moments later.</p>
<p>The brightness is adjustable. You can tweak the display from white to amber, depending on your environment. Switch to white light when you’re catching up on the latest Arundhati Roy book while soaking up some sun, and move to a warmer setting for bedtime reading. Even better, the Page Color feature inverts the black text and white background of pages of the books for an even more comfortable experience. It’s different from Dark Mode, and still offers colorful images and covers.</p>



<p>Kindle Colorsoft is also waterproof, which means you can take your favorite titles with you by the pool and to the beach, and even in the bathroom! The battery life is another strong selling point, as a single charge via USB-C gets you up to 8 weeks of reading – you read that right. That means you go up to two months without worrying about plugging the device in. This makes it great to take with you on your off-road adventures and long trips.</p>
<p>The Kindle Store lets you browse through more than 15 million titles from authors around the world, while the Kindle Unlimited subscription offers an all-you-can-read access to a wide catalog that includes best sellers. Prime members can read from a selection of eBooks, magazines, comics, manga, and audiobooks with their Prime membership. If you have young readers at home, you can even create a kid’s profile for unlimited access to a kid-friendly library with an Amazon Kids+ subscription.</p>
<p>All things considered, <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5794/">we highly recommend the latest Kindle Colorsoft to anyone looking to read more in 2026, especially at its current price of $200.</a> This deal saves you a nice $50 on this device, plus there are no delivery charges to worry about, either. Grab the deal before the price goes back up to $250.</p>

              <p>“I want to get this card graded,” my kid said to me yesterday about a full-art Furret he particularly loves. I looked at it closely, and pointing to a white fleck about half a millimeter in diameter on the top border I said, “It’s probably not worth it.” Such is the ridiculous standard required for grading Pokémon cards to a level that makes them valuable. Which makes it all the more surprising that someone just paid $550 for a Gold Star Charizard (thanks&nbsp;<a href="https://www.wargamer.com/pokemon-trading-card-game/charizard-gold-star-sale"><em>WarGamer</em></a>!) in such bad condition that it looks like it spent most of its last 19 years lying in a puddle.</p> <p>The <a href="https://www.serebii.net/card/exdragonfrontiers/100.shtml">Gold Star Charizard</a> is a legendary card that appeared in 2006’s EX Dragon Frontiers set, and one of the reasons that <a href="https://www.tcgplayer.com/product/98533/pokemon-dragon-frontiers-dragon-frontiers-booster-pack?page=1&amp;Language=English">buying a sealed pack from that set</a> will cost you around $1,000. A sealed booster box containing 36 packs <a href="https://www.ebay.com/itm/397369701976">could set you back $135,000</a>. (Even the empty cardboard box that once contained the cards <a href="https://www.ebay.com/itm/315985404998">goes for over $200!</a>) And the reason why is that a Gold Star Charizard in <em>perfect</em> condition, such that it receives a PSA grading of 10, is <a href="https://www.pricecharting.com/game/pokemon-dragon-frontiers/charizard-gold-star-100">currently valued at over $58,000</a>. Just loose out of the pack it will fetch you nearly $2k, and cards graded with the second-worst possible PSA rating, a 1, are priced at around $1,700. And that’s just the Zard. The Gold Star Mew in the same set fetches $7,500 in a PSA 10, and the Rayquaza ex gets as high as $3,700. There’s a lot of value to be found in those packs…if you’re fantastically lucky.</p>

 <p>Or, if you’ve been collecting for a while, you could go through your own collection and discover you pulled the card in 2006 without even knowing what it was, maybe played a few games with it, used it to practice flicking cards at your sister, then eventually dropped it in a pile on the floor which your mom picked up and put in a shoe box and then stored in a damp corner at the back of the attic. If so, you could have a cool $550 on your hands!</p>

 <p>It’s impossible to overstate <a href="https://www.ebay.com/itm/116964127279?nordt=true&amp;siteid=0&amp;customid&amp;toolid=10001">just how terrible the card sold by eBay seller roye_richa is</a>. It looks like it was somehow set on fire and drowned at the same time. Listed as the “WORLDS WORST CHARIZARD GOLD STAR EX Dragon Frontiers 100/101,” and originally priced at a somewhat optimistic $911, the entry made no bones about the state of it.</p>

 <p>“Ladies and Gentleman up for grabs is the worlds WORST Charizard Good Star,” begins the item description on eBay. “This is a card I have had since my childhood—technically. I found it on the playground after a rainy day—short to say this card is TRASHED. It barely constitutes as a card anymore it’s in such poor shape. The back of the card is ruined. The front is intact albeit again—severely worn.”</p>

 <p>And then again for emphasis:</p> <blockquote><p>“Again you are NOT purchasing a card of decent condition in any sense of the word. This is for the collector that needs this legendary card in hilariously awful condition—it’s truly one of a kind.”</p></blockquote> <p>It’s not clear where <em>WarGamer</em> got the detail of the card’s $550 sale price from, but the card definitely did sell to one bold collector. And, admittedly, this is the cheapest possible way to become the owner of such a card, even if it’s the most bedraggled one imaginable.</p>
