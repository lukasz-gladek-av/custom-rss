              <p>Two free mods for the PC version of <a href="https://kotaku.com/mafia-old-country-review-is-it-good-worth-playing-2000617529"><em>Mafia: The Old Country</em></a> that removed the clothes from one of the game’s main female characters were removed by publisher Take-Two Interactive using a DMCA request.</p> <p><a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/action/take-two-lawyers-give-mafia-nude-mods-the-cement-shoes-treatment-dmca-projects-that-had-the-dons-daughter-parading-in-the-buff/">As spotted by <em>PC Gamer</em></a>, a pair of NSFW nude mods for the recently released linear action game <em>Mafia: The Old Country </em>have been removed from popular modding site Nexus Mods by Take Two’s lawyers, according to a Nexus customer support representative on <a href="https://forums.nexusmods.com/topic/13520836-takedown-request-issued-by-take-two-interactive-software-inc/">the site’s forums</a>. One of the nude mods replaced Isabella Torrisi’s in-game model with a nude version.&nbsp; The other mod, “Extended Textures For Nude Isabella,” allowed players to modify the character’s model, letting them give her “bigger nipples, bigger areola,” and even offering “cute pubic hair” options, according to text still indexed on Google search results. Both of these mods were created by Nexus user norskpl.</p> <p>“A takedown/DMCA request was issued by Lisa Deere [on behalf of Take Two Interactive Software, Inc.] on 08/12/2025,” posted a Nexus mod rep on the forums. “We were able to internally verify the legitimacy of this claim through the requesting of additional evidence to prove the identity of the claimant and the rights they hold over the content in question.”</p> <p>Interestingly, screenshots of the mod seem to indicate that norskpl didn’t create the nude model of Isabella themselves, but instead ripped it out of a different part of <em>The </em><em>Old Country</em> which features a nude Torrisi in bed with another character. It seems that they then tweaked the model and added options to modify it using mods. So in a way, this is like Take-Two Interactive’s lawyers DMCAing their own content. It’s an odd situation, but not surprising, <a href="https://kotaku.com/take-two-is-removing-old-gta-mods-using-dmca-notices-1847315391">as in the past, Take-Two has used DMCA requests</a> to <a href="https://kotaku.com/take-two-interactive-removes-more-gta-mods-using-dmca-s-1848053219">yank down mods they don’t approve of in other games</a>, including <a href="https://kotaku.com/take-two-goes-on-another-grand-theft-auto-mod-killing-s-1847467984"><em>Grand Theft Auto V. </em></a></p> <p>Perhaps using the <em>Mafia: The Old Country</em>‘s own pre-existing nude model is the problem, as it is content owned by Take-Two being used in a way they likely don’t approve of. I wonder, had the modder had just replaced the don’s daughter with a nude Shrek or Thanos, if Take-Two lawyers would have shown up at all.</p>

              <p>More price hikes are coming <a href="https://kotaku.com/switch-2-ps5-prices-trump-tariffs-china-nintendo-sony-1851704901">thanks to President Trump’s tariffs</a>. Diapers, toothpaste, cars, it’s all about to get <a href="https://www.axios.com/2025/08/20/trump-tariffs-car-prices">more expensive</a>. Families are projected to collectively <a href="https://www.uschamber.com/tariffs/tariffs-bring-massive-new-taxes-on-food-apparel-back-to-school-items">pay millions</a> more for back-to-school supplies and $2 billion extra on new clothes. Home Depot <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/08/19/economy/home-depot-tariffs-prices">just warned</a> home repairs and renovations will get pricier too. In gaming, the latest wave of trade-war-fueled inflation is already here. The average console is now anywhere from $30 to $100 more expensive than it was a year ago. Trump’s tariffs are a lot of things—<a href="https://kotaku.com/switch-2-price-trump-tariffs-vietnam-china-trade-war-1851774438">random, chaotic, nonsensical</a>. They are also secretly a massive tax on playing <em>Grand Theft Auto 6</em>.</p> <p>Rockstar Games’ next blockbuster is expected to help sell millions of new PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X/S consoles, the only hardware you’ll be able to <a href="https://kotaku.com/gta-6-take-two-ceo-price-80-ps5-2000616607">play <em>GTA 6</em> on when it arrives next May</a>. It’s the kind of release that gets people who have been holding out on upgrading or who dropped out of gaming altogether to walk into a GameStop or Walmart and pick up a new console. And doing so will now cost an additional 20-35 percent, more than the <a href="https://taxfoundation.org/data/all/eu/value-added-tax-vat-rates-europe/">highest sales tax in Europe</a>. And console pricing could get even worse. Who’s ready for Nintendo to announce a Switch 2 OLED in 2027 that starts at $600?</p> <p>Microsoft was <a href="https://kotaku.com/microsoft-xbox-series-x-s-price-increase-may-2025-1851778615">the first to pull the trigger</a> on responding to Trump’s trade war with price increases. In May, the Xbox Series S went from $300 to $370 and the Xbox Series X went from $500 to $600. Controllers and headsets also got more expensive. <a href="https://kotaku.com/nintendo-switch-2-prices-pro-controllers-tariffs-amiibo-2000614471">Nintendo followed suit earlier this month</a>, holding the line on the $450 price tag of its new Switch 2 but bumping the older models up by $50, with accessories getting multiple rounds of price hikes. Sony <a href="https://kotaku.com/ps5-console-price-increase-sony-america-august-21-2000618873">has now thrown up its hands, too</a>. Having already raised the disc-less PS5 to $450 with the Slim redesign, it’s going to be $500 starting August 21, with the other versions, including the Pro, going up by $50 as well.</p>

 <p>“Even though Sony is diversifying away from China (for US bound shipments), it’s still an important manufacturing center for Sony. 30% tariff on China, 15% tariff on Japan, 20% tariff on Vietnam, 19% tariff on Malaysia means Sony is impacted no matter what,” <a href="https://x.com/ZhugeEX/status/1958185512075690196">wrote</a> Niko Partners research director Daniel Ahmad on X. “I was expecting a $50 price increase because Sony has been proactive in adapting in the wake of tariffs. Xbox’s price increase being slightly higher is because of the increased dependence on China (higher tariff).” He notes that prices could still go up again depending on whatever Trump decides to do next.</p> <p>When <em>GTA 5</em> launched in 2013, a new Xbox 360 was as cheap as $200, and a new PS3 was just $250. In today’s dollars, they would still only cost $280 and $350, respectively. Trump’s tariffs are far from the only reason console prices have gone way up, but they’ve certainly made an existing trend way worse in the U.S. Trade groups <a href="https://kotaku.com/switch-2-ps5-pro-game-console-prices-tariffs-report-1851779765">warned of billions</a> being sapped out of the video game industry if Trump went ahead with his most draconian tariffs. We’re not even in that worst-case scenario, and things already suck.</p> <p>None of this should be that surprising. Trump has been promising new tariffs for years. He campaigned on it. He got elected. He is doing it. And now we are stuck with the bill. The president has been promising for months to bargain his way out of dropping poll numbers and a possible economic recession by winning better trade deals and ushering in a new golden age of American manufacturing. So far, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/aug/18/trumps-tariffs-manufacturing-resurgence-jobs">it hasn’t worked</a>. It reminds me of lobbing a banana at the racers ahead of you in <em>Mario Kart,</em> only to miss them and end up driving over it yourself.&nbsp;Call it the art of the peel. <a href="https://www.nationalreview.com/2025/06/tariffs-yes-we-have-more-expensive-bananas/">Those</a> are getting more expensive, too.</p>
