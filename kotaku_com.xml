They’re headed to <em>Pokémon TCG Pocket</em> on March 27, alongside new creature and trainer cards hailing from <em>Pokémon Violet</em> and <em>Scarlet</em>’s Paldea region. Tatsugiri, Sprigatito, and Iono are just a few of the new faces arriving before the end of the month.</p><p>Exactly how rare will Shiny <em>TCG Pocket</em> cards be? The Pokémon Company and developer DeNA haven’t yet revealed the actual odds of finding one in a pack. They may be similar to current crown cards like the gold Charizard ex which has a 0.04 percent chance of appearing in packs. The Shiny Charizard ex shown in the trailer for Shining Revelry has two new rainbow symbols in the rarity section of the card, however, leading me to believe it will be even harder to find. </p><p>The good news is that players will have other things to occupy themselves with besides the pain of not finding shinies when the new set drops. <em>TCG Pocket</em>’s first Ranked matches are also going live in the game on March 27.

The event also included first-time reveals for previously unannounced games, of which many looked really neat. My personal favorite was a cozily bleak isometric survival crafting game called <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://store.steampowered.com/app/2604490/I_Hate_This_Place/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2604490/I_Hate_This_Place/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>I Hate This Place</em></a></span>. <br></p><p>We are now practically inundated with quarterly showcases and festivals from all the major events and platform holders, and they can’t always be revealing brand new games. So a lot of the <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JsFTvIsRYbw&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JsFTvIsRYbw" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">2.5 hour-long Future Games Spring Showcase</a></span> consisted of reminders of titles that was already announced, but so many continue to look cool, well worth a place on your radar. </p><p>That includes Brazilian roguelike ARPG <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://store.steampowered.com/app/1782460/Hell_Clock/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1782460/Hell_Clock/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>Hell Clock</em></a></span>, grimdark sci-fi adventure <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://store.steampowered.com/app/2154070/INDUSTRIA_2/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2154070/INDUSTRIA_2/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>Industria 2</em></a></span>, atmospheric puzzle platformer <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://store.steampowered.com/app/1928690/Bionic_Bay/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1928690/Bionic_Bay/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>Bionic Bay</em></a></span>, and cyberpunk shooter <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://store.steampowered.com/app/990380/METAL_EDEN/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/990380/METAL_EDEN/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>Metal Eden</em></a></span>. Also <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://store.steampowered.com/app/2447980/Crown_Gambit/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2447980/Crown_Gambit/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>Crown Gambit</em></a></span>, because I love me a good card-based tactical-RPG. A bunch of games also have recent demos out, including the evocative retro pixel-art JRPG <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://store.steampowered.com/app/1864000/Artis_Impact/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1864000/Artis_Impact/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>Artis Impact</em></a></span>. </p><p>In the meantime, here are nine games we didn’t know about until they were revealed during yesterday’s showcase. </p></div></div><div><p><em>Outriders</em> developer People Can Fly is taking a stab at a mix of the hottest live-service genres around. <em>Lost Rift </em>is a base-building survival shooter that combines PvE coop with PvPvE extraction gameplay. The crudest way I can describe it is mashing together <em>Far Cry</em>, <em>Fortnite</em>, and <em>Rust</em>. </p></div><div><p>Based on the Kyle Starks’ comic by the same name,<em> I Hate This Place </em>is about surviving in the woods by collecting resources in the day, and navigating occult horrors at night. What helps set it apart form similar survival crafting loops is the inky art-style and ‘80s analogue horror vibes. </p></div><div><p>Don’t be fooled, <em>Elsewhere Electric</em> is not a van life adventure game. It is instead a co-op first-person exploration game where you solve puzzles in a strange facility. It supports virtual reality headsets and will show each player different things, forcing them to communicate to overcome obstacles. </p></div><div><p>This one is a bonkers mashup. <em>Shelf Heroes</em> is an FPS with roguelike elements, and card-based perk powerups, and multiplayer co-op. You have to assemble your perfect action figure to take back your home from rogue toys. <em>Risk of Rain</em> <em>2</em> meets <em>Toy Story</em>?<br></p></div><div><p>What if you could ponder the Roman Empire from the cozy comfort of a <em>Stardew Valley</em>-like? <em>Romestead</em> looks the part, but will offer less chill with up to eight players battling for dominance across limited resource maps. So maybe less slice-of-life farming sim than <em>Age of Empires </em>clash of civilizations?<br></p></div><div><p>A robot with a gun awakens on an abandoned oil tanker and searches for meaning. <em>The Last Caretaker</em> calls on players to “craft, explore, and battle rogue machines” as they try to bring humanity back from apparent extinction. There’s a choose-your-own-adventure tag on Steam though, so maybe you can decide to leave humans behind in the end. </p></div><div><p>Kickstarted over four years ago, the table-top dark fantasy tactical RPG <em>Frosthaven</em> is getting a video game adaptation. It’ll feature single-player, co-op, and online multiplayer, with a closed beta happening soon, ahead of its Early Access release. </p></div><div><p><em>Raev</em> is a kingdom builder that blends RPG elements with 4X strategy. You guide a civilization of furries on their way to environmental harmony, architectural beauty, and societal greatness. It’s coming to PC in 2026. </p></div><div><p>Old-school first-person shooter <em>Painkiller</em> is being revived by Saber Interactive. The <em>Doom</em>-inspired fast-paced gothic gorefest will offer co-op as players battle the fallen angel Azazel and his army of demons using steampunk-looking weapons. </p><p>.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
