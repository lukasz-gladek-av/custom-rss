However, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c4gzmkjjj03o&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c4gzmkjjj03o" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">we are in the remarkably fortunate situation</a></span> where—so far at least—there has been no loss of life, nor any significant reports of harm. It’s still possible that large waves could affect a huge number of countries, as far afield as China, New Zealand and Peru, and 13 foot waves have affected parts of Russia. However, even tsunamis have, so far, been minor. Despite this, evacuations are vital, with reports that waves <em>could</em> reach 10 feet in Japan. As such, <em>Elden Ring</em> developers FromSoftware have left their offices and canceled July 31's planned release of Patch 1.02.</p><p>“Due to the tsunami warning following the earthquake near the Kamchatka Peninsula,” reads FromSoft’s statement, “we have decided to postpone the distribution of the ‘<em>ELDEN RING NIGHTREIGN</em>’ Patch 1.02, which was scheduled for today to tomorrow, July 31 (Thursday) after 10:00CEST / 1:00 PDT.”</p><p>Duo Mode was due to add the ability to play <em>Nightreign</em> in pairs, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/elden-ring-nightreign-duos-mode-option-patch-1-02-ps5-1851786981&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/elden-ring-nightreign-duos-mode-option-patch-1-02-ps5-1851786981">a feature fans have been begging for since the game’s release</a></span>. The game was launched designed to be played in groups of three, which is an unusual group size for multiplayer gaming, and clearly far harder to pull together than just partnering up. The lack of a two-player mode felt even more strange, though, given you could also play solo. Two days after the game came out, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/elden-ring-nightreign-duos-mod-seamless-coop-pc-1851783200&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/elden-ring-nightreign-duos-mod-seamless-coop-pc-1851783200">a modder created an unofficial two-player option</a></span>, demonstrating it was certainly possible. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.ign.com/articles/elden-ring-nightreign-director-says-duos-were-kind-of-overlooked-and-neglected-as-main-focus-was-on-3-players&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/elden-ring-nightreign-director-says-duos-were-kind-of-overlooked-and-neglected-as-main-focus-was-on-3-players" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">FromSoftware said at the time</a></span> that not including duos was rather oddly “overlooked during development,” and that the game had only been balanced for three-player play. That was due to change over the next couple of days.</p><p>Patch 1.02 was also going to launch alongside the addition of a second group of the more difficult Everdark Sovereign bosses, with Maris “Augur” Fathom of Night due to be first. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/elden-ring-nightreign-augur-evergaol-everdark-time-1851787245?_gl=1*2c3yjo*_ga*Nzg4NTQ4NDM0LjE2MjQwMjI5MDc.*_ga_V4QNJTT5L0*czE3NTM3ODEwNzckbzI3JGcxJHQxNzUzODcwODY5JGoxMCRsMCRoMA..&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/elden-ring-nightreign-augur-evergaol-everdark-time-1851787245?_gl=1*2c3yjo*_ga*Nzg4NTQ4NDM0LjE2MjQwMjI5MDc.*_ga_V4QNJTT5L0*czE3NTM3ODEwNzckbzI3JGcxJHQxNzUzODcwODY5JGoxMCRsMCRoMA..">As Ethan said yesterday</a></span>, what was one of the easier fights in <em>Elden Ring</em> is due to become one of the toughest bosses you can take on in <em>Nightreign</em>, but again, we’ll now have to wait a bit longer to experience this new encounter.</p><p>Obviously there’s no word yet on when the patch will now arrive. FromSoftware are doing the smart thing and keeping themselves safe. That’s clearly the priority far above rolling out a patch, and we wish everyone the very best.</p><p>Same to anyone near a coast in the vast affected portions of Earth today. Stay safe, listen to evacuation orders, and worry about video games later.</p><p>.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://kotaku.com/elden-ring-nightreign-patch-duo-mode-delay-earthquake-1851787291]]></content:encoded>

As a result, both cards have been replaced with a temporary placeholder that the team is actively working to replace with new artwork as soon as it’s ready.”</p><p>It sounds like well-loved illustrator Sie Nanahara was provided references either by Creatures Inc (the team behind <em>PTCG</em> art) or DeNA (the developers of this app) that included fan-made art, rather than previous official Pokémon artworks. This explanation lifts responsibility from the artist which—as we’d suggested previously—would have been a very surprising move by a very established creator. </p><p>“Immersive cards” are the animated collectibles that appear in every set of the digital card game. They are one of the top selling-points of the app, offering magical cards that play out beautiful animated sequences when clicked on. As a committed player, I’ve collected all of the previous immersive cards (finally got Celestial Guardian’s Solgaleo’s Lillie card yesterday after months of trying), and so know that these being missing from the new set is a pretty big deal for players.</p><p>It also means that replacing them is no easy feat. <em>PTCG Pocket</em> uses a mix of freshly commissioned art and classic cards, and in pretty much any other circumstance could have switched the affected artwork out with anything from the colossal archive. However, given the Ho-Oh and Lugia cards are animated, these will take vastly longer to create, often requiring enormous artworks for the camera to pan around, or complex 3D animations. Neither can be rustled up in an afternoon.</p><p>Unfortunately, the “temporary placeholder” in question is literally just some <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://bsky.app/profile/nintendaan.com/post/3lv64qgtsyc2b&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://bsky.app/profile/nintendaan.com/post/3lv64qgtsyc2b" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">“coming soon” text</a></span>. When “played” it just shows a black rectangle.</p><p>So far, I’ve not seen any accusations made regarding the Lugia immersive card, although suspect that it’s been removed at the same time as a precaution. While no blame is being placed on the artist, it makes sense to be concerned that the same issues could have arisen for both cards given they came from the same creator.</p><p>The Chinese artist whose work was copied has <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://x.com/lanjiujiu/status/1950436692789514610&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://x.com/lanjiujiu/status/1950436692789514610" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">posted a statement</a></span> regarding the issue as well, albeit an ambiguous one, referring to a past commission but not who commissioned the work. “I solely delivered commissioned 2D artwork,” he says in his own translation, “with no involvement in subsequent model production, sales, or profit sharing. This revealed past gaps in copyright awareness.” He added “profound gratitude” that the artwork had been removed.</p><p>The artist responsible for the immersive cards, Sie Nanahara, has yet to make any statements, and hasn’t responded to a request for comment.</p><p>.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://kotaku.com/pokemon-tcg-pocket-ho-oh-art-plagiarism-card-apology-1851787290]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Nintendo just reversed course on one of its most controversial changes to <em>Mario Kart World</em>, sorta. The Switch 2 maker just buffed the appearance rate of three-lap courses after <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/mario-kart-world-patch-notes-random-online-switch-2-1851785133&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/mario-kart-world-patch-notes-random-online-switch-2-1851785133">previously nuking a sneaky workaround</a></span> players had been exploiting to avoid the new game’s in-between driving sections. Somehow that’s not even the biggest change in the game’s first major update since launch. The Switch 2's biggest exclusive is back on the menu. </p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="197565" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="Nintendo Switch 2 Could Launch With Almost No Reviews" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="122" data-playlist="197565,197567,195670" data-current="197565"><div><p>Nintendo Switch 2 Could Launch With Almost No Reviews</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197565/197565_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197565/197565_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197565/197565_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/23089.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p><em>Mario Kart World </em><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://en-americas-support.nintendo.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/68580/~/how-to-update-mario-kart-world&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://en-americas-support.nintendo.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/68580/~/how-to-update-mario-kart-world" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">version 1.2.0</a></span> includes new features, lots of game tweaks, and some massive rebalancing. One thing that might bring back some lapsed players is this patch note: “Increased the frequency of lap-type courses appearing in the selection when choosing the next course in ‘VS Race’ and wireless races.” Fans are taking that to mean that traditional three-lap stages will be more frequent, including when playing online. </p><p>A big criticism of the game has been throwing lots of straightaway, interstitial courses into the mix that just have players racing between the actual tracks they want to play on. When<em> Mario Kart World</em> first released, choosing “random” while playing online automatically removed these tracks from the selection pool. The community’s preference was so strong it became common to see all 24 players in a race choose random. So, Nintendo being Nintendo, they got rid of that workaround in an apparent attempt to “force” fans to play <em>Mario Kart World</em> “the right way.” </p><p>The company now seems to have backed off a bit, though it’s anybody’s guess whether it was “bullied” into accommodating players’ preferences or simply wanted to try and fix how the random selection option worked without making everyone extra miserable. In any case, <em>Mario Kart World </em>version 1.2.0<em>&nbsp;</em>is so big, that’s not even the most consequential part of the update. Far from it, in fact.</p><p>“Made COM weaker in everything other than ‘Battle,’” reads a major change that’s already rippling throughout the community with fans unsure whether to embrace the difficulty nerf or call for an unofficial “hard” mode to return. Grand Prix and Knockout races could get pretty gnarly at 150cc (a 200cc mode doesn’t exist in the game yet, though many suspect it will get added at some point), and it’s not just the higher speeds that make things tricky. </p><p>Instead, its CPU racers tricking off every surface in sight and hammering players with shells and other items. <em>Mario Kart World</em>’s item box RNG also tends to incentivize players “bagging” it in last place before trying shoot up the ranks with the powerful items they’ve earned. Twenty-four players also means races have huge middle packs with double the carnage of previous <em>Mario Kart</em> games. We’ll see how it shakes out, but some players are already claiming special bragging rights for unlocking three stars—the highest performance rating—on all races before the CPU nerf. </p><p>Other significant patch notes include “made homing of Boomerang weaker” and “On the ‘Free Roam’ map, when you gather all of the P Switches, ? Panels, and Peach Medallions, the colors of the various numbers will now change.” There are also dozens of fixes to race tracks where players were previously falling through the map or getting snagged on trees and other obstacles. It’ll take some time to see how all the changes shake out, but it definitely feels like we’ve entered <em>Mario Kart World</em>’s first official “We’re so back” era. </p><p>Here are the full patch notes for ver. 1.2.0:</p><blockquote data-type="BlockQuote"><h2 id="h437088"><a id=""></a><strong>Latest update: Ver. 1.2.0 (Released July 29, 2025)</strong></h2><p><strong>General</strong></p><ul data-type="List" data-style="Bullet"><li>In the “VS Race” of “Single Player”, added “No COM” to the COM rules.</li><li>In the “VS Race” of “Single Player” and “Multiplayer”, added “Mushrooms only” to the item rules.</li><li>You can now choose “View Replay” after downloading ghost data in “Time Trials”.</li><li>You can now choose whom to watch when spectating in “Knockout Tour” and “Balloon Battle” in “Online Play”, “Wireless Play”, and “LAN Play”.</li><li>You can now see the waiting time until the next race or battle starts in “Online Play”, “Wireless Play”, and “LAN Play”.</li><li>When using CameraPlay in “Multiplayer” and “Online Play”, the game will now remember the camera cursor position and size until the player closes the game.If you change the number of people playing, the cursor position and size will return to their original settings.</li><li>On the “Free Roam” map, when you gather all of the P Switches, ?
