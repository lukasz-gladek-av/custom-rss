A cute but dangerous alien crash lands on Earth, pretends to be a dog, and becomes the pet and best friend of Lilo. Of course, as you would expect, shenanigans ensue. </p><p><em>Lilo &amp; Stitch</em> is set to arrive in theaters on May 23. Here’s the first official trailer: </p><p> <em>Lilo &amp; Stitch </em>stars Maia Kealoha as Lilo Pelekai. The original voice of Stitch, Chris Sanders, is back behind the now CG incarnation of the alien. He wrote and directed the OG animated film back in 2002. Sydney Agudong also stars as Lilo’s sister and guardian Nani Pelekai. </p><p>It’s been a long time coming for <em>Lilo &amp; Stitch</em>. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/movies/movie-news/lilo-stitch-live-action-disney-remake-works-1148811/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/movies/movie-news/lilo-stitch-live-action-disney-remake-works-1148811/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The live-action remake was announced all the way back in 2018</a></span>. Since then, the film has gone through a <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lilo_%26_Stitch_(2025_film)#Development&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lilo_%26_Stitch_(2025_film)#Development" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">tumultuous development</a></span>, with different directors and writers hopping on and off the project. At one point, <em>Wicked </em>director Jon M. Chu was attached to this thing! Wild. There was also casting controversy, too, with at least one actor replaced before filming after people spotted them using some slurs online. </p><p>But after all that,<em> Lilo &amp; Stitch </em>is finally coming to theaters, and after watching this first trailer my reaction is: Ehh... okay. Fine, whatever. Meh. </p><p>I understand that my love of the original will make it nearly impossible for me to be impartial about this new remake, but I just don’t think we needed this movie. Stitch seems mostly okay, but the trailer feels really flat and people seemed bored to be involved. The kid seems uninterested in what’s happening, likely because she’s a child and is being asked to act alongside nothing or blue-covered tennis balls. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/popculturechat/comments/1477upr/drew_barrymore_on_how_as_a_child_she_thought_et/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/popculturechat/comments/1477upr/drew_barrymore_on_how_as_a_child_she_thought_et/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Remember those stories of how the kids in <em>ET </em>cried because they thought he had died on set</a></span>? That ain’t happening in an era where every film uses CG to create their alien characters. </p><p>Regardless, I get that Disney wants money and I know that kids aren’t as into 2D animation or even CG animation anymore, and prefer live-action stuff. As a result, we are getting a live action remake of basically every Disney movie ever made, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/snow-white-seven-dwarfs-trailer-cgi-ugly-bad-disney-1851712570&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/snow-white-seven-dwarfs-trailer-cgi-ugly-bad-disney-1851712570">including the horrendous-looking <em>Snow White</em></a></span><em>.</em> And yeah, to be clear: This  movie and Disney’s other live action remakes are all for kids. So while I don’t mind dunking on it or laughing at people posting jokes about the new trailer on Twitter, ultimately, what will determine if <em>Lilo &amp; Stitch</em> is a success is if kids drag enough parents to the theater in May. We’ll find out this Summer. </p><p>&nbsp; .<br></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

What a time to be alive! With that in mind, here’s a look at crossplay in <em>Monster Hunter Wilds</em> so you and your buddies can hunt together. Oh come on, let’s face it, you’re going to attack each other with the Insect Glaive, right? But what’s this? It doesn’t seem to be working right away?

If you want, you can shut off crossplay by navigating to the <strong>Game Settings</strong> page via the main menu—not the in-game pause menu—then scrolling down on the first tab until you find <strong>Crossplay</strong>, then turning it to <strong>‘Off</strong>.’ Simple!</p><p>But don’t do that if your goal is following this guide! In fact, your entire squad must have crossplay enabled if you wish to utilize all of the game’s multiplayer mechanics, including Squad functionality.</p><h2 id="h2769931"><a id=""></a>There’s a catch, however!</h2><p><strong>You don’t unlock multiplayer from the start in <em>Monster Hunter Wilds</em></strong>. It requires <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/monster-hunter-wilds-how-long-to-beat-story-campaign-1851769015&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/monster-hunter-wilds-how-long-to-beat-story-campaign-1851769015">a relatively streamlined grind</a></span>. You’ll unlock the ability to join a lobby and invite squad members during <strong>Chapter 1 - Back to Camp</strong>, the game’s second story mission. It doesn’t take long to reach this point; under an hour or so if you’re quick-moving and frantically slapping creatures aside with reckless abandon. Everyone you want to play alongside needs to have done the same.</p><h2 id="h2769932"><a id=""></a><strong>How about cross-save functionality in <em>Monster Hunter Wilds</em>?</strong></h2><p>Okay, cool. You can play flawlessly with hunters from across the world on numerous current-gen systems and PC. But what about cross-save functionality for when <em>you’re</em> the one playing across multiple systems?</p><p>Unfortunately, <em>Monster Hunter Wilds</em> currently does not allow for cross-save progression. Your gameplay, story progress, and character creation data remain locked to whichever system you’re playing on. If you decide to hop from PC to PlayStation 5, for example, you must start a new game, a new hunter, and grind through the story and monster hunts a second time.</p><hr><p><em>Monster Hunter Wilds</em> is available now on PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series X|S. If you don’t have a buddy or two to hunt with, the game’s camp lobbies allow for up to 100 players simultaneously, and you can party up with any of them, so long as you have crossplay enabled!</p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
