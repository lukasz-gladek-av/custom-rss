              <p><span>Oh hey, it’s been a while since we did one of these. Actually, before we get to my favorite games of 2025, here were my favorite games of 2024 that I was so </span><a href="https://bsky.app/profile/shepardcdr.bsky.social/post/3ldmmw2n25c2x"><span>rudely not allowed to tell y’all about</span></a><span> last year.</span></p> <ol> <li><em>Metaphor: ReFantazio</em></li> <li><em>Dragon Age: The Veilguard</em></li> <li><em>Mouthwashing</em></li> <li><em>Arranger: A Role-Puzzling Adventure</em></li> <li><em>1000xResist</em></li> <li><em>Shadow Generations</em></li> <li><em>Persona 3 Reload</em></li> <li><em>Astro Bot</em></li> <li><em>Marvel Rivals</em></li> <li><em>Life Is Strange: Double Exposure</em></li> </ol> <p><span>I tend to get pretty reflective when I write these end-of-year lists. My </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/best-games-2022-pokemon-legends-arceus-overwatch-ofk-1849935691"><span>2022 list</span></a><span> was written mere days after I started here at </span><i><span>Kotaku</span></i><span>, and </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/best-video-games-2023-baldurs-gate-3-cyberpunk-sf6-1851113163#:~:text=Baldur's%20Gate%203%20to%20Pok%C3%A9mon%3A%20Kenneth%20Shepard's%20Most%20Spellbinding%20Games%20Of%202023,-Pok%C3%A9monRPGStreet"><span>my 2023 one</span></a><span> was put together shortly after I’d watched the site I’d moved my life across the country for get torn asunder in spite. I imagine my 2024 list would have read similarly, but my 2025 one? I’m maybe a little more hopeful than I’ve been in a while.</span></p> <p><span>In 2025, I’ve started to feel my spark come back. I’m writing things I’m proud of, I’m enjoying games like I’ve regained my sense of taste, and every now and again I get riled up about something happening in the industry with a passion that once felt like it had been siphoned out of me. In a roundabout way, my anger at an industry that keeps finding new ways to treat the people in it like they’re disposable is probably a good thing. A year ago, or even six months ago, I might have just let out a defeated sigh and rolled my eyes, then turned back to the blog mines. Now? I can feel my blood boiling again in a way it hasn’t in a long time.</span></p>

 <p><span>There are days when I still feel like I’m getting back on my feet, and like my legs are shaking underneath me as I try to stand tall again. Well, as tall as a 5’3” man can, at least. But if I’m feeling something about the games I’m playing and writing about, that’s an improvement over this time last year, when I wondered if I’d ever feel that again. Here are the 10 games that helped me get my spark back.</span></p>

 <p><i><span>Honorable mentions: Battle Suit Aces, Absolum, After Love EP</span></i></p> <figure id="attachment_2000655449" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000655449"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000655449">© Surgent Studios</figcaption></figure> <h2><b>10.<i>&nbsp;Dead Take</i></b></h2> <p><span>Surgent Studio’s escape room horror game </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/dead-take-review-ben-starr-neil-newbon-horror-game-1851787439"><i><span>Dead Take</span></i></a> <span>was one of the biggest surprises of 2025 for me. Though I find its overreliance on jump scares exhausting, I was enamored with how it captures the horrors of being in a competitive, creative field. During a long exploration of an abandoned mansion after a party he wasn’t invited to, Chase Lowry discovers horrors beyond comprehension behind every locked door(and some captured on USB drives). Even if I’m not an actor, anyone who has worked in a competitive, creative field knows how dangerous people in power with a cult of personality can be. They’ll manipulate people into betraying one another, and the desperate will grovel at their feet in the hopes that some of their prestige and notoriety will trickle down into their hands. Desperation breeds tragedy, but so does selfishness, and </span><i><span>Dead Take </span></i><span>delivers that unmistakable truth in every corner and hidden passage of its mansion.</span></p>

 <figure id="attachment_2000005257" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000005257"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000005257">© Hazelight Studios</figcaption></figure> <h2><b>9.<i>&nbsp;Split Fiction</i></b></h2> <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/split-fiction-review-hazelight-coop-game-it-takes-two-1851767470"><i><span>Split Fiction</span></i></a> <span>was an early favorite for GOTY that I feel like a lot of people cooled on pretty quickly. I understand why, to some extent. Its storytelling, while well-intentioned with its parallels to current anti-AI sentiment, is pretty amateurish for a game about fiction writers. But it also has the kind of varied, tight, cooperative platforming that only Hazelight is making these days, and the final level is a truly astonishing feat of technical prowess and design bravado that is so confident, you can tell Hazelight knew it was cooking when it pulled it off. I still remember how it felt when my co-op partner (shoutout </span><i><span>Restart</span></i><span>’s Jesse Vitelli) and I reached that moment in which the simulation of my character’s science fiction stories and his character’s fantasy ones overlapped, and the game didn’t so much as stutter as it seamlessly blended them both into one final, incredible set piece.</span></p>

 <figure id="attachment_2000642518" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000642518"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000642518">© Nice Dream / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <h2><b>8.<i>&nbsp;Goodnight Universe</i></b></h2> <p><span>There aren’t a lot of games that could possibly live up to </span><i><span>Before Your Eyes</span></i><span>, which remains one of the most affecting things I’ve ever installed on a game device. The eye-tracking adventure game’s follow-up, </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/goodnight-universe-review-before-your-eyes-webcam-baby-2000642517"><i><span>Goodnight Universe</span></i></a><i><span>, </span></i><span>had incredibly big shoes to fill, and I have to commend developer Nice Dream for even trying. Though it didn’t hit me the same way its predecessor did, I was still moved by the team’s knack for drawing connections between its characters that echo every messy, tangled web of feelings we might have for one another. </span><i><span>Goodnight Universe</span></i><span>’s eye-tracking mechanics are simultaneously bolder and less thematically precise than those of its predecessor, which makes some sense considering its story is less straightforward, yet it still manages to bring it all together in a stunning closing chapter. But it is, to its detriment, not as focused as </span><i><span>Before Your Eyes</span></i><span>, so it doesn’t stick the landing as well. Even so, these guys are ones to keep watching, and I will be first in line for whatever comes next.</span></p>

 <figure id="attachment_2000003670" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000003670"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000003670">© Don’t Nod Entertainment / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <h2><b>7.<i>&nbsp;Lost Records: Bloom &amp; Rage</i></b></h2> <p>I’m 33 years old now, and I’m still fighting battles I did as a kid. <a href="https://kotaku.com/lost-records-bloom-rage-tape-2-review-dont-nod-swann-1851776436"><i><span>Lost Records: Bloom &amp; Rage</span></i></a> <span>is a game for the quiet kids who, even once they reach adulthood, overthink everything they say and do when they’re in a group setting. You can know everyone in a room loves you and wants you there, and you’ll still second-guess every word that comes out of your mouth. Don’t Nod’s supernatural narrative adventure is a return to the </span><i><span>Life Is Strange</span></i><span> studio’s roots, and it’s wonderful to see the team back in its element, examining human connection in a way that, even if it appears singular on the surface, can resonate with anyone who’s ever once felt like they were on the outskirts of a group waiting for their turn to speak up.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><span>Even as I, playing as the introverted videographer Swann, sat in a small diner with people who were ostensibly my friends during the game’s modern-day segments, the flashbacks that colored in the lines of our relationship felt like the kind of intrusive adolescent memories that are embarrassing to look back on, as they’ve become distorted over time. </span><i><span>Lost Records</span></i><span> makes you look back on moments that felt huge as a kid only to realize they would feel small as an adult, but because they felt cataclysmic when you were young, the wounds they leave last far longer. The game</span> <span>understands that nostalgia and trauma intermingle, and examining one means encountering the other. The rose-colored filters through which we sometimes look back at the past can’t hide the challenges Swann and her friends sought to forget, and Don’t Nod is in top form as it lets you fill in the blanks.</span></p> <figure id="attachment_2000630352" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000630352"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000630352">© Bandai Namco / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <h2><b>6.<i> Digimon Story: Time Stranger</i></b></h2> <p><span>When you finish </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/digimon-story-time-stranger-the-kotaku-review-2000630341"><i><span>Digimon Story: Time Stranger</span></i></a><span>, the credits will show little sprite versions of your party, as it existed in specific story moments, walking across the screen. For me, it was always some form of three Digimon: Guilmon, Gabumon, and Gatomon. These three have been my favorite Digimon for over 20 years, and every time I head back to the Digital World, I’m looking for these three.</span></p> <p><span>One thing I will give the </span><i><span>Digimon </span></i><span>games over most other monster-taming games is that their experimental evolution system means you can have just about any party you want right out of the gate. I’m a sentimental guy, and having my three favorite Digimon as my only party throughout the entire run of </span><i><span>Digimon Story: Time Stranger</span></i><span> helped the RPG coast over some of the bumps in the road. I had my core three before I left the first dungeon, and I didn’t use any others throughout the rest of the main story. The advantage of these modular systems in monster-taming RPGs is that you are free to write your own story with your own party, and while I probably could have made the game easier if I’d traveled alongside other monsters, this was </span><i><span>our </span></i><span>story, and my friends aren’t replaceable.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <figure id="attachment_2000283175" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000283175"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000283175">© Ritual Studios / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <h2><b>5.<i> Fretless – The Wrath of Riffson</i></b></h2> <p><span>I will take a rhythm game in just about any form I can get it, and as developers have started adding musical mechanics to just about any game they can, I’m not really hurting for options. </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/fretless-wrath-riffson-deck-builder-music-rpg-review-1851786514"><i><span>Fretless – The Wrath of Riffson</span></i></a><span> marries sonic strategies and deck-building duels to such great effect that playing through its turn-based battles felt like reawakening to an old, often dormant version of myself who used to perform music professionally. I know a rhythm game is good when its musical minutiae becomes second nature to me, like the muscle memory of playing your favorite song on guitar. </span><i><span>Fretless </span></i><span>linking every dodge and damage boost to the beat of its music makes its timing-based mechanics a breeze because you feel it in the riffs and percussion underneath them. Sometimes I miss that old musician version of me, but it’s nice to know something like </span><i><span>Fretless </span></i><span>can bring him back out.</span></p> <figure id="attachment_2000621057" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000621057"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000621057">© Too Kyo Games</figcaption></figure> <h2><b>4.<i> Shuten Order</i></b></h2> <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/shuten-order-review-kodaka-danganronpa-hundred-line-2000621052"><i><span>Shuten Order</span></i><span>’s</span></a><span> individual murder mystery routes might not seem like that much to write home about, but together, the “multi-genre” detective story is a pretty ambitious effort made of five compelling adventure game stories. Rei Shimobe wakes up with amnesia, and is told that God himself has tasked her with solving her own murder. To do this, she must investigate one of five possible suspects. Each suspect leads her down a different route, with each having a completely different set of mechanics to play with and mysteries to solve. Though you’re accusing a different person of facilitating your demise each time, following each path to its conclusion is the only way to find the truth. </span><i><span>Shuten Order </span></i><span>is full of signature Too Kyo Games twists and turns, and yet, even as a connoisseur of the team’s work, I was still enraptured by the game’s many mysteries, and how it managed to essentially create five different games within one.</span></p>

 <figure id="attachment_2000003155" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000003155"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000003155">© Sandfall Interactive / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <h2><b>3.<i> Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</i></b></h2> <p><span>From its first hour, </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/clair-obscur-expedition-33-rpg-review-in-progress-1851777402"><i><span>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</span></i></a> <span>had its sights set on me, an RPG fan with a proclivity for stories that pick at every wound I’ve ever suffered. Sandfall Interactive’s debut game is a series of gutpunches punctuated by flashes of hope, with elaborate, timing-based battles in between. It circumvents a lot of the problems I have with turn-based games which can often feel too simple for my tastes, with battles that feel like wars of attrition rather than strategic encounters in which my build decisions truly make a difference. In </span><i><span>Clair Obscur</span></i><span>, dodging and parrying keep things interesting in the moment, but finding synergies in its characters’ bespoke mechanics is where the real thrills come in.</span></p> <p><span>But </span><i><span>Clair Obscur</span></i><span>’s grief-driven story is what has stuck with me the most. It is a story of despair, loss, and misdirection, with each twist more devastating than the last. Games about how the living must carry on when they have to leave those who have passed behind hold a vice grip on me. Grief holds a grip around my throat unlike any other experience in this life, and every time I see someone else’s interpretation of what it means to persist without those who helped you get where you are, I feel like I learn something new about how I handle it myself. Not every emotion and feeling </span><i><span>Clair Obscur</span></i><span> elicited from me on that front was a positive one. But I think that’s okay. I don’t think pretending grief always ends with acceptance is my style. It certainly isn’t </span><i><span>Clair Obscur</span></i><span>’s.</span></p> <figure id="attachment_2000652247" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000652247"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000652247">© The Pokémon Company / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <h2><b>2.<i> Pokémon Legends: Z-A</i></b></h2> <p><span>There’s a moment in </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-legends-za-review-switch-2-bugs-performance-2000637719"><i><span>Pokémon Legends: Z-A</span></i><span>’s</span></a><span> late game in which every named hero you’ve met in its Paris-inspired metropolis </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-legends-za-lumiose-city-ending-zohran-mamdani-2000641431"><span>bands together to save the city</span></a><span>, and it made me set down my controller and just take it all in. It has been three years since we got a </span><i><span>Pokémon </span></i><span>RPG, and it was within those three years that I’ve moved to New York City and grown to care about people and a place in a way I don’t think I ever have before. I’ve been putting off doing a lot of </span><i><span>Pokémon Legends: Z-A</span></i><span>’s </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-legends-za-mega-dimension-review-dlc-raichu-2000653106"><i><span>Mega Dimension</span></i></a><span> DLC side quests because there’s something comforting about knowing I still have reason to go back to Lumiose City, as if when the credits roll, all those feelings of community and home might disappear.</span></p>

 <p><i><span>Legends: Z-A </span></i><span>is not a perfect game, and there are no doubt people reading this who are throwing tomatoes at their screen because I’m not mad about window textures, but it is a </span><i><span>Pokémon </span></i><span>game that speaks directly to me. Its real-time fights represent one of the most interesting evolutions of the series’ battle system, and make for a much more entertaining, almost puzzle-like iteration in which even quick fights feel fluid, strategic, and engaging in a way they don’t in even my favorite </span><i><span>Pokémon </span></i><span>games. But more than that, </span><i><span>Z-A</span></i><span> cultivates a feeling of belonging by focusing on a city and the people who would lay their life on the line to protect it and each other.</span></p> <p><span>I run around Lumiose with my Raichu by my side who, after a decade of waiting, can finally Mega Evolve, and stories play out in my mind of Grisham waving as we pass by his coffee shop, or Tarragon’s workers yelling at us as we climb their scaffolding. We return to Hotel Z and meet up with the rest of Team MZ, ready to discuss how we can best help the city as it struggles to figure out how to allow humans and Pokémon to live in harmony. I love going on journeys across a region in </span><i><span>Pokémon</span></i><span>, but for this moment in my life, a </span><i><span>Pokémon </span></i><span>game that spends a long enough time in one place to actually think about its world and how to make it a better place is exactly what I need. If the </span><i><span>Legends </span></i><span>series is going to be Game Freak’s place to experiment, I’m so on board for whatever it does next.</span></p> <figure id="attachment_2000002144" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000002144"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000002144">© Too Kyo Games / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <h2><b>1. <i>The Hundred Line: Last Defense Academy</i></b></h2> <p><span>It’s kind of a bummer to say that </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/the-hundred-line-last-defense-academy-the-kotaku-review-2000651792"><i><span>The Hundred Line: Last Defense Academy</span></i></a><span> is my favorite game of the year but I will probably not be “finishing” it any time soon. I have seen Too Kyo Games’ incredible, ambitious visual novel/tactical RPG’s true ending, but there are still dozens of final chapters I haven’t seen myself. I don’t know if I ever will. The knowledge that so many are still waiting for me is so daunting, it keeps me from picking the game back up and diving in. But knowing those 90+ conclusions are in the game, and that I could have stumbled upon any of them if I’d made one different choice, is still such an achievement. Even as it intimidates me, I can’t help but be in awe of </span><i><span>The Hundred Line</span></i><span>.</span></p> <p><span>I really can’t name a moment in a video game that hit me harder this year than the first “ending” in </span><i><span>The Hundred Line</span></i><span>. I’d spent 100 in-game days fighting an invading alien force attacking the titular academy only to fail the mission I’d been tasked with. I could let myself sit in that failure, or I could go back in time, repeat those 100 days, and hopefully do it better next time. I felt a mix of awe and anxiety, as I had an embargo coming up and realized the game was going to be, at minimum, twice as long as I’d anticipated. I wrote a </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/hundred-line-last-defense-academy-review-danganronpa-1851777031"><span>vague impressions post</span></a><span>, singing its praises but not being able to explain why; then, a few weeks later, I finally </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/hundred-line-last-defense-academy-steam-switch-reviews-1851781786"><span>laid out what happened</span></a><span>, and why I wasn’t ready to review the game here at </span><i><span>Kotaku</span></i><span>. I spent a vacation dragging myself through the game’s “truth” route, uncovering all the mysteries within the school and finding a stunning Kazutaka Kodaka finale. That guy hasn’t let me down once on that front, and it makes the promise (threat) of 100 endings as scary as it is tantalizing.</span></p>

 <p><span>I know I can count on Kodaka for a lot of things. He takes narrative swings most writers would shy away from; his work is polarizing and obnoxious on its way to making an incredibly profound and existential point about why any of us even bother to get out of bed in the morning when giving into nihilism and rotting away would be so much easier, and my god, does he know how to deliver it with the force of a baseball bat to the gut. </span><i><span>The Hundred Line </span></i><span>isn’t just one of the most ambitious visual novels of all time, it’s led by one of the only writers with the gusto and reckless abandon to make it work.</span></p> <p><span>I hope one day that I’ll head back to the Last Defense Academy to uncover more of its secrets, silly antics, and strategic battles. But at the moment, what I’ve seen is enough to know that I could not have played a game this year that would have resonated with me more than </span><i><span>The Hundred Line</span></i><span>. </span></p>

            <title><![CDATA[Samsung microSD Card Drops to $0.13 per GB Record Low, Practically Free Storage Upgrade for Nintendo Switch, Steam Deck, and More]]></title>
            <link>https://kotaku.com/samsung-microsd-card-drops-to-0-13-per-gb-record-low-practically-free-storage-upgrade-for-nintendo-switch-steam-deck-and-more-2000655456</link>
            <guid>1392598</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Everybody loves a great gift bundle, even when it’s of the DIY variety. If you already have a Steam Deck or Nintendo Switch 2 bought and wrapped and ready, there’s still time to create an awesome holiday bundle by making the very small addition of the <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6411/">Samsung P9 Express microSD card — the 256GB version is selling at Amazon for 40% off, and going fast.</a></p>
<p>The P9 Express microSD card isn’t exclusively a gaming accessory — it works like any microSD card, with the ability to add storage and memory to tablets, drones, digital cameras, and more — but it has the speed and thermal protection that make it ideal for handheld consoles like the Switch 2 and the Steam Deck. Its transfer speeds reach up to 800 MB per second, which is an impressive 4x faster than Samsung’s standard microSD cards. When you’re using it as an extended storage device for games and downloadable content, that speed makes a huge difference.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6411/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Best of the Best</h2>
<p>Samsung’s enormous footprint in the tech world makes it easy to forget the fact that they’re also the world’s No. 1 flash memory brand, and have held that title since 2003. It makes sense that in the Samsung universe that’s populated by elite-level big-screen TVs, laptops, tablets, smartphones, and wearables, a humble microSD card that measures just 0.59 by 0.43 inches and weighs less than one-hundredth of an ounce can be easily overlooked.’</p>
<p>But the data sheet for the P9 Express microSD card makes it look like an absolute giant. That sequential read speed of 800 MB/s is tailor made for handheld gaming consoles. Games load and install far faster than with other microSD cards, and the all-important downloadable content that often requires weeks of gaming to earn is also safely stored and at the ready.</p>



<h2>More Than Just Fast</h2>
<p>The amazing speed is obviously the main draw to the P9 Express microSD card, along with its seamless compatibility with the market’s two top handheld gaming consoles — the Nintendo Switch 2 and the Steam Deck. Then there is its expansive compatibility with other tech devices like digital cameras, drones, smartphones, and more. But none of that would matter if the card itself was fragile, or prone to breakdowns and data failure.</p>
<p>Samsung, thankfully, has given the P9 Express six distinct forms of protection to ensure its long life and reliability. The P9 Express is designed to withstand extreme temperatures ranging from -13°F to 185°F, up to 72 hours immersed in seawater, airport x-ray machines, magnetic forces up to 15,000 gauss (equivalent to a high-field MRI machine), drops of up to 16.4 feet, and up to 10,000 swipes. Needless to say, it’ll survive the rigors of handheld gaming.</p>
<p>The Samsung P9 Express microSD card makes a fine stocking stuffer on its own because it’s so universally useful, but as a companion with a brand-new handheld gaming console, it’s a serious winner. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6411/">It’s also selling seriously fast at Amazon right now, so get there before the 40% off deal dropping its price to just $33 ends.</a></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>After being announced in <a href="https://kotaku.com/nintendo-announces-metroid-prime-4-1796058481">2017</a>, <a href="https://kotaku.com/metroid-prime-4-beyond-kotaku-review-is-it-good-120-fps-switch-2-2000651400#comments"><em>Metroid Prime 4: </em><em>Beyond</em></a> finally launched on Switch and Switch 2 earlier this month to solid reviews, but also plenty of complaints about the game’s open-world desert hub. Well, it turns out that despite realizing that players were souring on open-world games, development studio Retro was stuck with its design and had to finish it.</p> <p>In a new interview with Japanese video game magazine <em>Famitsu</em>, the development team behind <a href="https://kotaku.com/metroid-prime-4-beyond-graphics-comparison-switch-2-ugly-2000650585"><em>Prime 4</em></a> talked openly about the game’s controversial open-world hub and motorcycle. <a href="https://www.resetera.com/threads/new-famitsu-interview-with-nintendo-staff-regarding-metroid-prime-4-beyond-its-development-history-origins-its-placement-within-the-timeline-etc.1392244/">The answer below comes from ResetEra via machine translation</a>:</p>

 <p>“At the start of the project, perhaps due to the influence of <em>The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild</em>, we saw a lot of comments on the internet saying ‘we want to play an open-world <em>Metroid,</em>‘” explained an unspecified member of Retro Studios. “However, <em>Metroid’s</em> core element of ‘increasing the amount of explorable areas by unlocking powers’ is not very compatible with the ‘freedom to go anywhere from the beginning’ of open worlds. Thus, we thought to design a limited area that could be freely explored, and have that be a hub that could connect to other areas.”</p>

 <p>However, the development of<em> Metroid Prime 4</em> took “longer than expected to finish” and had already been reset once <a href="https://www.cnet.com/tech/gaming/metroid-prime-4-on-nintendo-switch-samus-aran/">in 2019</a> after Bandai Namco, the game’s original developer, was removed from the project and replaced with <em>Prime</em> creators Retro. And in that time, Retro says fan feelings towards open-world games “changed.” But, apparently, another reset was “out of the question,” and so the team had to move forward with its open-world hub despite knowing that many players wouldn’t be happy about it.</p>

  <p>In the same interview, it’s further explained that during the creation of <em>Prime 4,</em> shooters and action games evolved and became faster. The team ignored these changes so it could retain the “tempo of an adventure game.” The end result, Retro says, is a game that is “pretty much divorced from the changing of times.”</p>

 <p>As for the inclusion of the game’s <a href="https://kotaku.com/metroid-prime-4-impressions-first-level-volt-forge-titanfall-2-factory-2000650657">divisive motorcycle, Viola</a>, Retro told the outlet that it came about because the player moves fairly slowly in <em>Prime 4,</em> and traversing the large open area of the desert was a problem.</p> <p>“While Samus possesses high-speed abilities like the Boost Ball and Speed Booster, we determined that ‘riding a bike’ was the optimal solution to satisfy both the perspective of ‘moving freely and quickly across large areas’ and the perspective of ‘looking cool,” said Retro. “Then we thought that if one could move around on the bike in a satisfying way in that area, it could be a segment that mitigates the tension from exploration, and paces the whole game.”</p>

 <p>It’s certainly nice to hear more about how these decisions were made, but it doesn’t change the fact that the open-world hub in <em>Prime 4</em> just didn’t work out.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/pokemon-legends-za-mega-dimension-attack-pathing-bug-2000655683</link>
            <guid>1392577</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><span>I’ve put dozens of hours into </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-legends-za-review-switch-2-bugs-performance-2000637719"><i><span>Pokémon Legends: Z-A</span></i><span>’s</span></a> <a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-legends-za-mega-dimension-review-dlc-raichu-2000653106"><i><span>Mega Dimension </span></i><span>DLC</span></a><span>, and for a while, I thought the issue I was encountering on occasion in which my Pokémon, when fighting in the new Hyperspace maps, would go in the opposite direction of their target and attack air, was just a minor, occasional oddity not worth much attention, and so I opted to just navigate around it as best I could. But after putting way more time into grinding the game as I </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-legends-za-dlc-mega-dimension-special-scan-2000654217"><span>try to find Latias in a randomly generated portal</span></a><span>, I went looking to see if anyone else had experienced this odd, battle-breaking bug. </span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/LegendsZA/comments/1pmgt7x/what_the_heck/"><span>Turns out, I am not alone</span></a><span>.</span></p> <p><span>Though this glitch isn’t exclusive to one of the randomly selected Hyperspace maps, this odd attack pathing does seem to occur most frequently on the one that has a mostly open field with one or two large scaffolding structures on the edges of the area. These maps are made up of the “dreams” of Lumiose City citizens, so they manifest as distorted images of the actual metropolis, mashing together different areas with no rhyme or reason. So while this area doesn’t have buildings, it does have scaffolding of the sort you often find near buildings in the real Lumiose, and if you use a close-range attack, Pokémon will often race toward the structure and get caught in it long enough that the attack will time out and they’ll automatically use the move, often striking the air instead of a wild monster.</span></p>

 <p><span>I managed to capture this footage of my Mega Raichu flying away from an Alpha Pidgeot that’s about to whoop my ass when I told him to use Thunder Punch. This move should be a quick close-range jab, but instead Raichu decides to take the scenic route and gets caught on the scaffolding.</span></p>

 <figure id="attachment_2000655687" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000655687"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000655687">© The Pokémon Company / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p><span>For the moment, in the absence of an official fix, players are finding ways around it. Attacks like Psychic and Thunderbolt don’t miss, so even if your Pokémon takes an odd detour in Hyperspace, you can at least know you won’t be wasting your </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-legends-za-mega-dimension-hyperspace-donuts-tips-2000652670"><span>limited time in these rifts</span></a><span> with an attack that won’t land. But it would be nice to not have to do that, so we’ve reached out to The Pokémon Company for comment on the situation.</span></p>

 <p><span>While many fans have reported weird attack pathing with close-range attacks and Pokémon taking odd routes to strike an opponent, the oddest example of this for me involved one of my Pokémon barely moving at all when using mid-range ones like Flamethrower. My Houndoom, who is my go to fire-type attack user, is typically able to breathe fire on an enemy and take them out in one hit. However, when positioning for this attack in Hyperspace, the hellhound almost always stops short of getting its target within the attack’s actual range, leaving my opponents with a strange hot flash rather than anything that actually makes contact. If my trainer character wasn’t in range himself, Houndoom would never get close enough to land the hit.</span></p>

 <p><span>In </span><i><span>Legends: Z-A</span></i><span>, you’re often challenged to initiate battles without being detected, and if you can get in range to lock onto a foe, your Pokémon will move in to close the distance, but with mid-range attacks like Flamethrower, the pathing seems wonky in </span><i><span>Mega Dimension</span></i><span>.</span></p>

 <p><span>I really didn’t notice it much during my initial playthrough, but the more grinding I’ve done, the more I see this is a really strange and frequent problem, especially for types that typically battle at close range like fighting and normal. Hopefully this can get patched soon and Mega Raichu can keep flying up to fools and knocking them out </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-legends-za-mega-dimension-evolution-raichu-x-2000652246"><span>Superman-style</span></a><span>.</span></p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/bose-goes-full-clearance-on-noise-canceling-earbuds-as-quietcomfort-ultra-earbuds-2nd-gen-hit-an-all-time-low-2000655308</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Good-quality in-ear headphones offering solid sound with a comfortable fit, plus a decent battery life, can be hard to find. And when you do manage to find a pair, it usually costs an arm and a leg. Well, that’s not the case today.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6592/">We just spotted the 2nd-generation Bose QuietComfort Ultra wireless noise-canceling earbuds going for $249 at Amazon, after the retailer took a nice $50 off their usual price</a>. The offer also includes a 60-day free trial to Audible, which sweetens it even more.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6592/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Multiple Listening Modes</h2>
<p>This premium pair of earbuds lets you choose from nine combos of eartips and stability bands to find the right fit for yourself. The umbrella-shaped tips seal the opening of your ear to prevent outside noise from coming through, but the customization does not end here. QuietComfort Ultra earbuds pack CustomTune technology that analyzes the shape of your ear and adapts the headphones to it for an even better sound experience.</p>
<p>Audio quality is top-notch. There are multiple listening modes to choose from; Quiet, Aware, Immersion, and Cinema. The Quiet mode offers active noise cancellation, which blocks all background distractions (laughter, chatter, traffic). It’s great for when you want to focus on a task in a busy setting, or just want to zone out with your favorite song for a bit. Of course, this level of noise cancellation does not work for every situation. Sometimes, it’s better to stay aware of all that’s taking place around you, and for that, there’s the Aware mode. This one lets some ambient sounds in while still offering high-quality audio. You will be able to enjoy music while also staying in touch with the outside world.</p>



<p>The Immersion Mode blends noise cancellation with Bose Immersive Audio for the most realistic listening experience, while the Cinema mode balances background sounds and sound effects for a theater-like experience. Basically, these handle everything from energy-filled tracks to calm sounds, video content, and more with ease.</p>
<p>Phone calls get better with the Bose SpeechClarity technology that uses noise-rejecting mics to cut out background noise and focus on your voice. Translation? Clearer calls, even when you’re in a noisy cafe or a packed subway.</p>
<p>As for the battery, you’re looking at around 6 hours of playtime in Quiet or Aware Mode, and up to 4 hours with Immersive Audio. The case holds up to three full charges, meaning topping these up on the go won’t be an issue. What’s more, the pair supports both wireless and wired charging via USB-C, so you’ve got options on that front too. It’s best to download the Bose app to keep your gear updated and access all the latest features as they are released.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6592/">On a regular day, this pair would run you around $299, but the current 17% discount makes it easy to pick one up for less.</a> The offer applies to all color options, including black, plum, gold, violet, and white. You can pick the one that goes with your aesthetics the best.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/stardew-valley-switch-2-free-upgrade-multiplayer-2000655682</link>
            <guid>1392550</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><em>Stardew Valley</em> just got better on Switch 2, <em>Marvel Rivals</em> is pitching a big 2026, and we finally have our first teaser trailer for Nicolas Cage as John <em>Madden</em>. It’s the latest edition of Morning Checkpoint, <em>Kotaku</em>‘s daily roundup of gaming news and culture. While many were battling big game service outages over the holiday, from <em>Arc Raiders</em> to Steam, I was battling <em>Minecraft</em> for the original Switch, which I bought for my kids because of the Mario add-on but which keeps crashing on startup.</p> <p>It’s something fans have apparently dealt <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Minecraft/comments/1jdy320/minecraft_nintendo_switch_keeps_crashing_i_feel/">with for years</a>, but I’m still shocked that a mash-up of two of the biggest franchises in gaming on the second-most-popular console ever is in such poor shape. We ended up going analog instead and playing the board game Trouble, which devolved into hitting and shouting even more quickly than our normal <em>Mario Kart World</em> Grand Prixes. This Christmas left me with much to think about!</p>

  <p>The hit pixel art farm sim costs $15 on Switch 2 and the <a href="https://x.com/Wario64/status/2004216532658946536">upgrade is free</a> to everyone who already owns the game. You might be thinking, what is the point of a Switch 2 upgrade for a 2016 indie game? Well, this one adds mouse control support, local co-op support for four-player split-screen (up to eight online), and Game Share support so people can play on different Switches together locally even if they don’t own the game.</p>

 <p>Unfortunately, the Switch 2 version also <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/StardewValley/comments/1pvzsr7/ca_has_acknowledged_the_issues_with_the_switch_2/">has some unexpected issues</a>, including errors when people try to connect to multiplayer online and crafting resources not being spent correctly. “I am aware that there are some issues with the nintendo switch 2 edition that just dropped,” the developer <a href="https://x.com/ConcernedApe/status/2004474989119160737">wrote on X</a>. “I take full responsibility for this mistake. We will fix this as soon as possible.”</p>

 <p>ConcernedApe’s next game,&nbsp;<em>Haunted Chocolatier</em>, is due out in the next couple of years, but <em>Stardew Valley</em> has continued getting big updates in the meantime. For anyone who still can’t get the Switch 2 version to appear in the eShop for them, <a href="https://x.com/ralumss/status/2004481466525442375">try deleting the game and re-installing</a>.</p>

 <h2>2026 will be the year<em> Star Citizen</em> crosses $1 billion in funding</h2> <p><a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/sim/star-citizen-is-on-course-to-reach-usd1-billion-in-player-funding-in-2026-and-we-still-might-not-get-to-play-its-singleplayer-campaign-next-year/"><em>PC Gamer</em> reports</a> that the sci-fi ship simulator has currently reached $927,641,376 in funding from over 6 million players. That puts it on track to cross the $1 billion threshold sometime next year. That’s more than most big blockbuster game development budgets put together, coming from a mix of crowdfunding and microtransactions. What we don’t still know, however, is when the game’s long-awaited single-player campaign will arrive. Director Chris Roberts <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/sim/chris-roberts-hopes-star-citizens-launch-will-be-almost-as-big-an-event-as-grand-theft-auto-6-still-targeting-2026-for-its-squadron-42-singleplayer-campaign/">recently projected</a> that the game might hit 1.0 sometime in 2027 or 2028.</p>

 <h2>You can now wash in <em>Red Dead Redemption 2</em>‘s rivers</h2>  <p>That’s thanks to a new mod from <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/reddeadredemption2/mods/7688?tab=description">user Saul0097</a> (via <a href="https://www.thegamer.com/red-dead-redemption-2-immersive-washing-rivers-lakes/"><em>TheGamer</em></a>). The new mod lets you dip into any body of water in the sprawling open-world game and wash all the mud, sweat, and blood off your face and clothes. Another small step for modders, another big leap for immersion.</p>

 <h2><em>Marvel Rivals</em> isn’t going anywhere</h2> <p>“2025 was more of a warm-up period for us,” executive producer Danny Koo <a href="https://www.denofgeek.com/games/marvel-rivals-creators-on-leveling-up-the-game/">told <em>Den of Geek</em></a>. “Next year, we’re going to have bigger plans. We’re not going to slow down. We’ve already planned more than a year ahead and I can’t wait for our players to see it.”</p> <h2>Ex-<em>GTA</em> dev doesn’t think Rockstar will get “greedy” with<em> GTA 6</em> pricing</h2> <p>“I don’t think the price tag for <em>GTA 6</em> will be $100,” former animator Mike York <a href="https://esportsinsider.com/">told <em>Esports Insider</em></a>. “I think it will come out at $70, around the flatline of normal releases. I don’t think Rockstar Games feel they need to release it at a higher cost. They’ll sell so many copies of the game that they won’t need to be greedy and charge $100.”</p> <h2>ICYMI:</h2> <ul> <li><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-gen-10-wind-wave-map-leak-pikachu-professor-2000655613">New Pokémon leaks show the gen 10 games might be going full<em> Assassin’s Creed Odyssey</em>-mode</a></li> <li><a href="https://kotaku.com/theres-no-better-time-than-the-holidays-for-time-traveling-jigsaws-2000655404">The winter break is the perfect time to try <i>Strange Jigsaws</i></a></li> <li><a href="https://kotaku.com/clair-obscur-2-gen-ai-awards-sandfall-interactive-2000655599"><em>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</em>‘s developers say their games will only be made by humans moving forward</a></li> </ul> <h2>Watch this:</h2>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/dji-slashes-the-osmo-gimbal-stabilizer-to-a-record-low-following-drone-clearance-deals-2000655254</link>
            <guid>1392511</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p data-start="0" data-end="408">Ever experienced this? You’re recording an important moment on your phone, maybe your child about to score their first goal in a peewee soccer game. You decide to run alongside them, phone in hand, trying to capture the action. But when you watch the video afterward, you realize it’s a shaky, unwatchable mess. The footage bounces around with every step, making it nearly impossible to see what’s happening.</p>
<p data-start="410" data-end="803">That’s why anyone serious about filming, whether professionally or as a hobby, should consider adding a gimbal stabilizer to their toolkit. Amazon has some excellent year-end deals active right now with some great discounts on DJI’s phone stabilizers. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4668/">For example, the DJI Osmo Mobile 7P, usually priced at $129, is now only $109.</a></p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4668/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<p data-start="805" data-end="1071">While the Osmo Mobile 7 and 7P share many features, the 7P offers a few upgrades. One key difference is that the 7P includes a retractable extension rod built into the handle, which adds extra versatility, allowing you to use it as either a selfie stick or a tripod. It’s worth the little bit of extra change to have that flexibility in how you can use it.</p>
<p data-start="1073" data-end="1229">Attaching your phone to the gimbal is a breeze thanks to DJI’s magnetic connection system. This means you can start filming immediately with minimal hassle.</p>


<h2 data-start="1073" data-end="1229">Native Tracking</h2>
<p data-start="1231" data-end="1700">The Osmo Mobile 7P come with intelligent tracking features that make your filming experience much smoother. They can automatically track your subject, keeping the camera stable and free from any shaky hands or movement. Even if your subject suddenly changes direction, the gimbal adjusts to keep them in focus. If the subject briefly disappears from view, like behind a tree, the gimbal will continue tracking, ensuring your footage stays seamless and fluid.</p>
<p data-start="1231" data-end="1700">If you’re filming solo and want to shoot in selfie mode, you’re covered. Just convert the handle into a tripod, allowing the gimbal to stand upright on its own. You can control the shot remotely with simple hand gestures. For instance, raising your palm will start or stop the tracking, while a “double-L” with your thumbs lets you adjust the framing. A “V” or peace sign will trigger the camera to take a photo or begin/end video recording.</p>
<p data-start="2165" data-end="2378">The battery life on this model is impressive, lasting up to 10 hours on a single charge. When you’re done filming, the gimbal folds up easily into a compact, portable form, making it convenient to take on the go.</p>
<p data-start="2380" data-end="2560" data-is-last-node="" data-is-only-node="">With this DJI stabilizer for iPhone and Android, you’ll never have to worry about shaky footage again.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>It’s hard to think of the last time something changed home lighting as much and as radically as the advent of the multi-colored app-driven LED light. Edison, maybe? But even the Wizard of Menlo Park would have been blown away by the lighting setups that Govee keeps coming out with. If you’re&nbsp;<em>really</em> fast, you can order one like this <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6591/">Govee RBIC Cylinder Floor Lamp while it’s 41% off at Amazon.</a></p>
<p>While this limited-time deal is still going, the Govee RBIC Cylinder Floor Lamp is easily the best $100 full-room transformation you can make. Even above the 1500 lumens of brightness that will fill your space, it comes with over 64 pre-programmed scenes and lighting effects, and the DIY potential to create your own is virtually limitless. It’s all app-controlled and smart home friendly, and it takes up precious little space in proportion to the way it fills a room with incredible lighting.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6591/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Tall Cool One</h2>
<p>The Govee RBIC Cylinder Floor Lamp is perfectly designed for corners, standing an impressive 68.8 inches hight but only 10.3 inches at the base and an especially slender 3.2 inches across the top of the cylinder. When we say “some assembly required,” we mean very, very little — it comes in five pieces, all of which screw together by hand. No tools required and certainly no knowledge of wiring or anything of that sort.</p>
<p>Once it’s up and running, you’ll go to the app to start experimenting. This is an easy rabbit hole to enjoyably go down, because there are literally millions of colors available. The brightness, timer, and patterns are all entirely under your control through the intuitive and free Govee Home App. The lamp can be set for accent lighting, fun party effects, or full-on room-brightening.</p>



<h2>How Customizable?</h2>
<p>The level of customization of the Govee RBIC Cylinder Floor Lamp’s effects is beyond impressive.

Add your pattern or any other color scheme you create to the six different music sync modes to watch them dance in beat with whatever tunes you’re playing. Or, stick with the generous library of 64 preloaded scenes. There’s no shortage of compelling, mood-setting lighting effects available, from sedate to dramatic to whimsical.</p>

<h2>Earbuds that provide excellent audio</h2>
<p>These earbuds have Active Noise Cancellation technology to help eliminate ambient sound so you can clearly listen to whatever it is you’re playing. Whether you’re using the earbuds while commuting through heavy traffic or you’d like to listen to music without distractions at home, the Active Noise Cancellation feature automatically adjusts to your surroundings.</p>
<p>Additionally, if you need to be aware of your surroundings, such as in a crowded restaurant or while walking through a busy airport, the Transparency Mode allows you to hear your surroundings by allowing ambient sounds to filter into the earbuds without needing to remove them.</p>
<p>All of that, and the AirPods sound great, too. They boast clear, balanced audio with crisp high notes and powerful low notes that make music feel alive. In addition, the Adaptive Equalizer (Adaptive EQ) dynamically adjusts the sound to the unique shape of your ears providing a customized listening experience without manual adjustment of the EQ settings.</p>

Once fitted correctly, the earbuds sit comfortably against your ear without being overly tight and can accommodate extended periods of use, whether for listening or working out.

<p>In terms of battery life, these AirPods boast several hours of playback per charge and the compact charging case can give you plenty of additional power. In addition, when you need to recharge the earbuds, simply place them back in the case and they begin charging immediately. Then charge up your case and do it all again when it’s all depleted.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6363/">For just $199, you really can’t beat the latest Apple AirPods model.</a> They’re a smart investment for anyone looking for great audio, especially if you’re already a part of the iOS ecosystem.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p data-start="0" data-end="470">If you’ve been considering upgrading your smartphone, now is the perfect time to treat yourself to something fresh and exciting. Amazon has just made it even easier for you to do so, with the Google Pixel 10 and Pixel 10 Pro being offered at some hefty discounts. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6590/">The Pixel 10, featuring 128GB of storage, has dropped from $799 to as low as $549</a>. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5783/">Meanwhile, the Pixel 10 Pro with 128GB of storage is now available for just $749, down from its original price of $999.</a></p>
<p data-start="472" data-end="1445">Both the Google Pixel 10 and Pixel 10 Pro come equipped with a 6.3-inch display that boasts a resolution of 1280 x 2856. While this isn’t quite as large as the Pixel XL’s 6.8-inch screen, it still provides an optimal viewing experience, making it perfect for reading tex messages and watching videos alike. The display is bright, vibrant, and remains clear even under direct sunlight. Plus, it supports a smooth 120 Hz refresh rate, which makes gaming and general use feel fluid and responsive. The Pixel 10 Pro is available in a range of colors, and regardless of the option you choose, they are all part of the deal that brings the price down to just $749. For the standard Pixel 10, the frost and obsidian (white and black) colors are available for $599, while the funkier lemongrass and indigo options are discounted by an additional $50, bringing them down to $549. Though, you were likely planning to slap a case on it right away, so who needs to worry about color, right?</p>

<h2 data-start="1447" data-end="1481">Pro-Level Photography Features</h2>
<p data-start="1482" data-end="2068">When it comes to photography, the Pixel 10 Pro stands out with its impressive triple rear camera system. The 50 MP main camera is paired with a 48 MP telephoto lens, offering pro-grade zoom capabilities. You can now take photos or record videos at up to 100x Pro Res Zoom, which delivers the best zoom quality the Pixel series has seen to date. There’s also a 48 MP ultrawide camera that allows for macro focus, making it easy to capture incredibly detailed close-up shots of small subjects. On the front, a 42 MP camera ensures your selfies and video calls are crystal clear and sharp.</p>


<p data-start="2070" data-end="2427">The Pixel 10 Pro also comes with built-in Gemini, Google’s AI assistant, which seems to be getting baked into everything these days whether you want it or not — including in smartphones. Gemini is designed to help by doing things like creating group shots from multiple photos, generating images, summarizing unread emails, and other stuff of the like. It’s powered by Google’s next-gen chip, which enables the phone with the processing power needed to fully utilize AI.</p>
<p data-start="2429" data-end="2784" data-is-last-node="" data-is-only-node="">As for cellular service, the Pixel 10 and Pixel 10 Pro are both unlocked, meaning you can choose the carrier and data plan that best fits your needs—whether that’s Google Fi, Verizon, T-Mobile, AT&amp;T, or any other major carrier. Currently, you can save up to $250 on either the Google Pixel 10 or Pixel 10 Pro, making this an ideal time to upgrade your device.</p>
