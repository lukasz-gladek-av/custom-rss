              <p>Nintendo has been contacting some customers with a survey link, asking questions that are primarily focused on people’s thoughts about physical versus digital games, and especially the Switch 2’s game carts that <a href="https://kotaku.com/switch-2-key-card-game-cart-physical-list-confirmed-1851777742">don’t actually contain the game</a>. The <a href="https://nintendoofamerica.co1.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_e54yuThgl5J1nnM">link for the survey</a> is being <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/NintendoSwitch/comments/1mgrkzm/here_is_nintendos_survey_about_physical_and/">widely shared</a>, and while it’s not clear if Nintendo will properly log responses from those who weren’t deliberately contacted, the company is sure to notice the sheer volume of attention it’s receiving.</p> <p>“Imagine you are purchasing a new Nintendo Switch or Nintendo Switch 2 game for yourself,” the survey asks at one point before describing different ways publisher distributes games. These include, “Physical, requiring digital download,” which is described as, “The physical cartridge allows the download of a full digital game to the console. The cartridge must be inserted into the console to play the game. The cartridge can be shared and resold.” People can then respond to this notion with options ranging from “Definitely would buy” to “Definitely would not buy.” Whichever you choose, it’ll ask you why you made that decision, with a box to type your answer into. It then asks the same of buying games for others as gifts. “Because I don’t want to buy someone the idea of a game,” a person might type.</p> <p>The Switch 2’s “game key cards” have proven extremely controversial since the notion was announced. Last week’s <a href="https://kotaku.com/nintendo-direct-switch-2-key-cards-persona-3-octopath-1851787455">desultory Nintendo Direct re-ignited this frustration</a>, with a series of previously revealed games that people struggled to find enthusiasm for, made worse by the knowledge that so many would be game key cards–in other words, fake carts that simply contain an instruction for the console to download the game from the eStore.</p>

 <p>It’s tempting to view the game key cards as a step up from digital purchases, given you now have at least a physical object that can be resold or shared, and to some extent that’s true. However, it remains a hugely bad deal for customers, given that the cart will only work for as long as Nintendo maintains the servers it connects to. And given all of gaming history, that’s inevitably nowhere near as long as anyone would hope. As such, unlike your Game Boy cartridges from 1989 that will still work just as well today, all of these gameless key cards will be useless pieces of plastic in maybe twenty years’ time.</p> <p>As a result, people are leaping on this survey to express their views about this. Clearly Nintendo is aware it’s an issue, given that the survey is dominated by this topic. However, it’s unclear whether unsolicited responses will be counted by the company when survey company Qualtrics hands over the results. Even though the URL can be stripped of all its identifying details, there’s a chance it will still look for an ID that isn’t there and not count the response. But, and it’s a crucial but, given the attention this survey is now getting, and the press coverage responding to that, it’s impossible that Nintendo won’t at the very least notice the level of reaction. Heck, it’s all we’ve got. It seems worth a try.</p>

              <p>2006 action-RPG <em>Titan Quest</em> has never really gone away, through a combination of DLC, re-releases, a mobile version from DotEmu, belated console ports, and expansions released as recently as 2021. It remains incredibly playable today, a game I personally return to every few years, a friendly, approachable <em>Diablo</em>-like. It turns out, however, that there’s now a sequel?! <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bY6yb8OoFvw">Announced a year ago</a>, but barely ever talked about,&nbsp;<em>Titan Quest II</em> entered early access Friday 1 August.</p> <p>Released almost 20 years ago in 2006,&nbsp;<em>Titan Quest</em> was the first and last project made by Iron Lore Entertainment–a studio set up by <em>Age of Empires</em>‘ Brian Sullivan–an action-RPG set within Greek and Egyptian mythology. And crucially, it was an action-RPG released midway through the enormous, aching twelve-year gap between <em>Diablo II</em> and&nbsp;<em>Diablo III</em>. It delivered so perfectly, this lower-intensity, more easily accessible loot-hoovering click-fest, and I dearly loved it. <a href="https://kotaku.com/diablo-4-action-rpg-blizzard-torchlight-path-of-exile-1850506636/3#content">Love it, in fact</a>. So much so that just a few nights ago–entirely unaware that <em>Titan Quest II</em> even existed–I suggested that my 10-year-old give the original a go on his Android tablet, given the game and its many DLCs are all free on Play Pass. He’s been playing it obsessively ever since, fueled by his love of Greek mythology and his innate understanding of game systems…and his love for hitting stuff with sticks.</p> <p>It was only because of his boasting that I even learned&nbsp;<em>Titan Quest II</em> existed, let alone had released into early access. He got me to start the game over on my own tablet, and was then boasting that he was a higher level than me. Can’t have that. So I re-installed the game on my PC to see what saves I had. Sadly, everything from the original preceded even Steam, let alone cloud saves, but fortunately I had at least a low-level character still higher than his own on the&nbsp;<em>Tenth Anniversary Edition</em>. And in the process of putting him in his place, I noticed “<em>Titan Quest II</em>” coming up as a search result. I assumed it was some sort of wishful thinking, checked it out, and, er, it’s a thing!</p>

 <p><iframe loading="lazy" title="Titan Quest II | Early Access Release Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="about:blank" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen="" data-rocket-lazyload="fitvidscompatible" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ikmiyR8rutw?feature=oembed"></iframe></p> <p>It’s honestly just weird not to have heard this game was coming. Even though I have a few massive gaps in my perception, as a games critic I tend to have a decent idea what’s in development–but that I was unaware of a sequel to one of my all-time favorite games remains just weird. Then again, a similar sentiment was shared on Reddit’s r/ARPG earlier this year, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ARPG/comments/1ja4xm5/how_in_the_hell_is_no_one_in_here_talking_about/">with a post titled</a> “How in the hell is no one here talking about <em>Titan Quest 2</em> Playtest?” No one there continued to talk about it.</p> <p>It perhaps doesn’t help that it’s nothing to do with the original game. While 2006’s&nbsp;<em>Titan Quest</em> was published by THQ, that company ceased to properly exist in 2013 when it went spectacularly bankrupt, auctioning off all its licenses. Eventually the trademark was bought by Nordic Games, the company that would go on to be called Embracer Group, and THQ Nordic remains a publishing arm that handles a lot of former THQ properties. Also, developer Iron Lore is long gone, unable to secure funding for a second game in 2008, with a bunch of the developers going on to form Crate Entertainment, creators of the wildly successful <em>Grim Dawn</em>. Instead&nbsp;<em>Titan Quest II</em> is developed by Grimlore Games, a studio created by Nordic Games in 2013, but that has since only released a barely noticed remake of <em>Spellforce III</em>. It’s all so strange!</p> <p>I’ve just started playing, and honestly, after barely 15 minutes, I’m delighted! This looks and feels like&nbsp;<em>Titan Quest</em>, but updated in a bunch of useful ways. I will continue on and report back in much more detail soon.</p>
