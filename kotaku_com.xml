              <p>Building your own custom gaming PC is a good way to save some money versus just outright buying a pre-built, but that doesn’t exactly mean it’s cheap. PC parts can be expensive and as you start adding CPUs, graphics cards, SSDs, and more to your cart, that number skyrockets pretty fast. If you can find any of those parts at a discount, it isn’t such a bad idea to pay them some attention. For instance, this ASUS TUF gaming motherboard is on sale over at Amazon as part of a limited time deal. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3837/">The Z790-Plus WiFi normally goes for $250, but right now you can grab one for 24% off. That saves you $64, bringing the price down to just $186.</a></p>
<p>With the ASUS TUF Z790-Plus WiFi, you’re getting onboard WiFi 6 as the name implies. Expect ultra-fast wireless networking speeds and improved capacity. The motherboard is also Windows 11-ready right out of the box.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3837/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<p>You’ll find your connection options are highly versatile. The TUF-Gaming Z790-Plus WiFi packs three different USB 3.2 Gen 2 Type-C ports on it with two in the rear and one in the front. You also have support for Thunderbolt 4.</p>
<p>There are four PCLe 4.0 M.2 slots which support up to two 22110 devices along with NVMe SSD RAID. The PCLe slots are reinforced with a metal sheath which keeps your cards firmly in place to ensure you don’t have issues with anything disconnecting, even when moving around your PC.</p>
<p>The PCLe slots are equipped with a quick release physical button. Custom PCs are sort of your own little Ship of Theseus in that you’ll find yourself making incremental upgrades throughout its life. Those quick release buttons will make upgrading your storage or graphics card much easier down the line.</p>



<h2>Cooler by Design</h2>
<p>Keeping your gaming PC cool can be an uphill battle. The ASUS TUF Z790-Plus WiFi motherboard has been engineered to help keep temperatures down. It’s armed with an enlarged VRM heatsink. Plus three M.2 slots along with the PCH feature heatsinks which help provide enough mass and surface area so heat can dissipate. The multi-layered circuit board allows it to spread out around the voltage regulators which improvs system stability.</p>
<p>So if you’ve been putting together a list of PC parts to consider for your custom gaming tower, this ASUS TUF Z790-Plus WiFi motherboard might just fit the bill. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3837/">It’s currently $64 off with that 26% discount. Instead of paying $250, you can get it for just $190 for a limited time.</a></p>
