I’m left somewhere in between. Of course it’s not up to me at all, but my pie-in-the-sky hope is that we do see a sequel of sorts to <em>The Last of Us Part II</em>, a kind of coda to conclude the series. But rather than being packed with more of the suspenseful violence that helped make <em>The Last of Us </em>one of the most well-known game franchises of all time, I hope the sequel leaves it behind entirely. </p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="195928" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="How Alan Wake 2 Builds Upon The 'Remedy-Verse'" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="190" data-playlist="195928,195922,195896" data-current="195928"><div><p>How Alan Wake 2 Builds Upon The 'Remedy-Verse'</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195928/195928_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195928/195928_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195928/195928_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195928/195928_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/21446.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>(<strong>Note</strong>: this post will discuss the ending of <em>The Last of Us Part II</em>, so if you’re only discovering the story via the TV show, there may be what you consider <strong>spoilers ahead.</strong>)</p><figure id="" data-id="afpvuwnfoibrncd6upmy" data-recommend-id="image://afpvuwnfoibrncd6upmy" data-format="png" data-width="800" data-height="88" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Spoiler Warning." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><span data-id="afpvuwnfoibrncd6upmy" data-recommend-id="image://afpvuwnfoibrncd6upmy" data-format="png" data-width="800" data-height="88" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Spoiler Warning." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>The remarks, which Druckmann made during <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://variety.com/2025/tv/news/the-last-of-us-season-2-abby-video-game-changes-backlash-1236327786/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://variety.com/2025/tv/news/the-last-of-us-season-2-abby-video-game-changes-backlash-1236327786/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">an interview with <em>Variety</em></a></span>, aren’t the worst news I could have heard about the future of <em>The Last of Us. </em>If my choices are between another hyperviolent entry in the series and no game at all, I’ll choose the latter, because while I admire the first two games, I don’t think there’s anywhere meaningful left to take from the violence at their core. The characters have  already suffered so much, endured so much, and wrought so much violence themselves; what’s to be gained from seeing them continue to be trapped in this vicious cycle, enacting even more brutal violence on each other?</p><p>No. In my opinion, the only place to go from the second game’s crescendo of brutality and bloodshed, which ultimately sees one major character spare the life of another she has fought very hard to kill, is to explore who these characters become and what they’re left with <em>after </em>breaking the cycle. The only meaningful way forward for the series, it seems to me, is in seeing these characters forge some kind of new path for themselves that, at long last, leaves the violence which has exacted such a terrible price behind.</p><p>In all likelihood, such a game would never get made because that violence is considered core to the series’ marketability. The nailbiting and often staggeringly brutal combat is what makes them blockbusters. And yet, if any studio working in the so-called “AAA” space can challenge the notion that a game in a franchise like <em>The Last of Us</em> needs to involve violence, it’s Naughty Dog. After all, this is the team that produced the work which, more than any other game up to this point, goes against the conventional wisdom about M-rated AAA games: <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/the-last-of-us-left-behind-the-kotaku-review-1521786675&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/the-last-of-us-left-behind-the-kotaku-review-1521786675"><em>Left Behind</em></a></span>, the story-focused DLC expansion for <em>The Last of Us. </em></p><figure id="" data-id="5741f95ef83c7d4f4b0d1bcbffaae87f" data-recommend-id="image://5741f95ef83c7d4f4b0d1bcbffaae87f" data-format="png" data-width="1654" data-height="925" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Ellie and Riley make goofy &quot;romantic&quot; gestures in a photo booth in a moment from The Last of Us: Left Behind." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Ellie and Riley make goofy &quot;romantic&quot; gestures in a photo booth in a moment from The Last of Us: Left Behind." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="false" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Naughty Dog</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="5741f95ef83c7d4f4b0d1bcbffaae87f" data-recommend-id="image://5741f95ef83c7d4f4b0d1bcbffaae87f" data-format="png" data-width="1654" data-height="925" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Ellie and Riley make goofy &quot;romantic&quot; gestures in a photo booth in a moment from The Last of Us: Left Behind." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>This release took mechanics that had been components of the original game’s brutal combat—stealthy sneaking, brick throwing, and so on--and recontextualized them as the stuff of bonding and play between Ellie and her friend (and crush) Riley while they explore an abandoned mall. <em>Left Behind </em>did still have combat in it; Ellie had to fight both humans and infected in the game’s “present day,” in between flashbacks to her trip to the mall with Riley. Even so, the DLC chapter<em> </em>illuminated the possibility for releases to exist in the AAA space that are more about storytelling, character interaction, and environmental exploration than about traditional video-game action.</p><p>So here’s what I’d love a follow-up to <em>The Last of Us Part II </em>to be: a new chapter, perhaps somewhat akin to <em>Left Behind</em>, that de-emphasizes combat or abandons it altogether, and focuses its energies entirely on bringing the story to a close that shows the characters carrying on their lives now that the circle of violence has been broken. Who can they be, now that they are no longer pursuing vengeance? What kind of relationships can they form? What kind of world can they try to build, for themselves and each other? I think these are fascinating questions, rich with storytelling possibility. I especially want to see Lev, a character introduced in <em>The Last of Us Part II </em>who is only just beginning to come into his own by the time the game ends, get to discover and define himself.</p><p>Truth be told, I think the shocking violence of the existing two games could be given new meaning if we really get to see the characters, at long last, finding their way out of it, out of its limiting and destructive patterns that have cost them all so much. We are not doomed to live that way. We can make better choices. And the remarkable thing about such a game is that, in illuminating new possibilities for the lives of its characters, it would also show new possibilities for the realm of AAA games. </p><figure id="" data-id="1014788c3765f300446ece32a500b47a" data-recommend-id="image://1014788c3765f300446ece32a500b47a" data-format="jpg" data-width="1299" data-height="724" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Ellie looks at a skyline on an overgrown city street in a moment from The Last of Us Part II." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Ellie looks at a skyline on an overgrown city street in a moment from The Last of Us Part II." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="false" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Naughty Dog / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="1014788c3765f300446ece32a500b47a" data-recommend-id="image://1014788c3765f300446ece32a500b47a" data-format="jpg" data-width="1299" data-height="724" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Ellie looks at a skyline on an overgrown city street in a moment from The Last of Us Part II." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>I don’t think it has to be a 25-hour epic like <em>Part II </em>was.

I think that game looks rad, and I hope it sells like hotcakes. But what if, in addition to doing mainstream commercial work like that, Naughty Dog was able, with Sony’s full support, to produce something riskier, something less commercial that defied the rigid expectations that hold so much sway in mainstream gaming? Isn’t there value in making bold artistic choices, in broadening people’s notions of what’s possible within a space? It may not make heaps of money, but I bet a move like that would earn respect and be very exciting to those who care about games as an art form.</p><p>In <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://carolynpetit.medium.com/broken-people-broken-worlds-thoughts-on-the-last-of-us-part-ii-a012de5d2acf&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://carolynpetit.medium.com/broken-people-broken-worlds-thoughts-on-the-last-of-us-part-ii-a012de5d2acf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">a piece about <em>The Last of Us Part II</em></a></span>, I lamented all the things the game, in its endless, indulgent violence, didn’t show us:</p><blockquote data-type="BlockQuote"><p>Why don’t we get to see Ellie doing the work of trying to be a better person? Why don’t we get to see her trying to rebuild things with Dina, and trying to internalize what Joel said to her, that she deserves to love and be loved? Because these remain the limits of AAA games. Because that’s the part where no shooting happens, and therefore it remains outside the scope of a game like this. Because we’re still so trapped.</p></blockquote><p>We don’t have to be trapped anymore, though. Naughty Dog has demonstrated that it’s more than capable of brilliantly creating the kind of interactive storytelling that could give <em>The Last of Us </em>the poignant, meaningful coda it deserves. I don’t really want a standard <em>Part III </em>for this series, not if it comes with even more of the horrifying, senseless, profoundly costly violence that has defined the series up to this point. But a game that breaks that cycle? That lets the series end on a note of tenderness, of muted, grounded hope for a better world or a different way of life? Yeah. That I’d like to see. </p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

With my shiny platinum trophy under my belt, I have conquered all the challenges, seen every sight, and felled entire armies by myself. And throughout all of that, not only did I never need reforged weapons to overcome any postgame challenges, I almost made an otherwise easy-to-get trophy way harder on myself. Here’s the breakdown.</p><h2 id="h733"><a id=""></a><strong>Why weapon reforging is awesome…in theory</strong></h2><p>Let’s cut to the chase: <strong>weapon reforging <em>technically</em> offers you the best weapons in the game</strong>. As you progress into the endgame, you can find weapons as high as Grade 7 as drops in battle. If you grind out enough Grade 7 weapons, you can merge them into an armament with a whopping 623 Attack stat and a slew of six passive skills of your own choosing. It’s those passives that are key here; normally weapons feature a mix of common and rare passive traits, but nothing’s stopping you from loading your weapon with all rare traits that will push your damage per second to the moon.</p><p>Nothing in the game will quite match the power of a fully upgraded Grade 7 weapon. But you <em>will </em>find weapons that come awfully close, and therein lies the rub.</p><figure id="" data-id="4fee9f009ae2ece60aa47058102f3aa3" data-recommend-id="image://4fee9f009ae2ece60aa47058102f3aa3" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A screenshot of the equipment screen from Dynasty Warriors: Origins.

Considering you can attain these weapons early in your postgame grind, they offer a huge jump in power. We’re talking attack power on par with a fully upgraded Grade 7 weapon and a suite of six passive abilities that aren’t <em>great</em>, but are still perfectly acceptable for a non-forged weapon.</p><p>Luan weapons are all unique, so they can’t be upgraded or edited at all via weapon reforging. This is why a maxed out Grade 7 weapon can still outperform a Luan weapon in the end. But is the minor difference in power worth the massive difference in effort?</p><h2 id="h735"><a id=""></a><strong>Why Luan weapons are better than Grade 7 weapons in practice</strong></h2><p><strong>Getting a maxed Grade 7 weapon involves a huge grind</strong>. For reference, even after completing <em>everything </em>in the game, I didn’t get a single Grade 7 weapon past +40 with the drops I naturally acquired. Conversely, many Luan weapons aren’t even locked behind especially hard postgame challenges. For example, the Lurking Luan sword is locked behind the “Final Battle against the Yellow Turbans” mission in Chapter 1, and I completed this challenge with time to spare even though I was several levels below the recommended level 71.</p><p>By the time I reached max level through naturally completing Ultimate Warrior missions, I had <em>ample </em>power to defeat anything and everything the game could throw at me. Taking the time to grind out maxed Grade 7 weapons would have been total overkill.</p><figure id="" data-id="7201ce68e997b666953a334961062d06" data-recommend-id="image://7201ce68e997b666953a334961062d06" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt=" A screenshot of the Weapon Reforge menu from Dynasty Warriors: Origins.

The Deadly Perfection achievement is unlocked by fully upgrading a weapon, so you can’t miss this if you want 100 percent completion. Fortunately, as long as you’re not gunning for a fully upgraded Grade 7 weapon, this one is pretty easy.</p><p><strong>To easily get Deadly Perfection, just save your game and spend all your money on upgrading any weapon Grade 6 or lower</strong>. Since you can find and outright purchase weapons with +20 modifiers already on them, this is significantly easier to grind out as long as you have the cash. In fact, a +99 Grade 6 weapon will perform about on par with a +13 Grade 7 weapon, so you could choose to use one if you’re starting Ultimate Warrior. But if you’d rather save your cash, you can reload your game after getting your trophy.</p><p>To be clear, there’s nothing wrong with wanting a fully upgrade Grade 7 weapon! If you’re down for the grind, it’ll certainly make the rest of your postgame challenge easier. But if you’d rather save your time, you’re not missing much.</p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
