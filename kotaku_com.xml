Well, some of the devs behind that project are making something completely new and unrelated to <em>Half-Life</em>. It’s called <em>Rogue Point</em> and it’s a tactical co-op shooter with roguelite elements. </p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="196653" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="The Week In Games: A Star Wars Classic Returns &amp; More New Releases" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="105" data-playlist="196653,196131,195371" data-current="196653"><div><p>The Week In Games: A Star Wars Classic Returns &amp; More New Releases</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196653/196653_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196653/196653_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196653/196653_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196653/196653_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/22209.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/black-mesa-the-kotaku-review-5944812&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/black-mesa-the-kotaku-review-5944812">First released in 2012</a></span> after years of development,<em> Black Mesa</em> was initially a free-to-download mod that recreated most of <em>Half-Life </em>using the more powerful Source engine. The game was developed by a large group of fan modders known as the Crowbar Collective. In 2015, the team released a paid version of the mod after getting approval from Valve. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.pcgamesn.com/black-mesa/definitive-edition&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.pcgamesn.com/black-mesa/definitive-edition" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Finally, in 2020</a></span>, the game was updated to include all of the Xen levels and other improvements. Since then, people have wondered what Crowbar Collective was working on next, and now we know. </p><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://youtu.be/jFQvOaxl6lk&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://youtu.be/jFQvOaxl6lk" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">On November 11, Team17 and Crowbar Collective revealed</a></span> the first trailer for <em>Rogue Point. </em>A press release for <em>Rogue Point</em> explains the game’s setup: After the richest man in the world dies, his giant empire is up for grabs my mercenaries and other companies. You are part of an independent and elite tactical group dedicated to stopping the dangerous corporate war and the mercenaries involved. </p><p>Here’s the first trailer for the newly announced game: </p><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://store.steampowered.com/app/1843840/Rogue_Point/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1843840/Rogue_Point/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>Rogue Point</em> is a cooperative four-player tactical shooter</a></span> built around planning and executing missions to complete runs. Each run is different and  dynamically generated using a mix of hand-built assets and randomly selected elements, according to an answer from a developer on Reddit. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/RoguePoint/comments/1goui5y/crowbar_collective_ama_all_about_rogue_point/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/RoguePoint/comments/1goui5y/crowbar_collective_ama_all_about_rogue_point/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">That AMA also revealed</a></span> that the game will support solo players and offline play.<em> Rogue Point </em>is being developed using Unreal Engine 4. As players complete missions and progress through a run, they’ll unlock new skills and evolve their operator, similar to progression systems in other rogue-lite games.</p><p>“Just like <em>Black Mesa</em>, we want to heavily involve the community in our development and updates. Our community was critical in the Early Access of <em>Black Mesa</em><strong> </strong>and having Team 17 as a partner for <em>Rogue Point </em>helps us focus on development and community feedback,” said Crowbar Collective CEO and Project Lead Adam Engels. </p><p>“We cannot wait to go in-depth about the game, and everything we learned while creating a new IP as well as turning Crowbar Collective into a full-time development studio.”</p><p>No specific release date was given for <em>Rogue Point</em>’s Early Access release. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://store.steampowered.com/app/1843840/Rogue_Point/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1843840/Rogue_Point/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">You can wishlist the game on Steam</a></span>. </p><p> .<br></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
