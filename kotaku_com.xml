            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>In her introduction email to Xbox employees, Asha Sharma, the <a href="https://kotaku.com/phil-spencer-xbox-leaving-retirement-microsoft-2000672059">new CEO of Microsoft Gaming</a> and former president of Microsoft’s CoreAI, promised a return to Xbox. This, <a href="https://kotaku.com/nothing-about-the-big-xbox-shakeup-makes-sense-2000672914">among many other things</a> about the announcement, raised some questions, with perhaps the most relevant being, “<a href="https://www.polygon.com/phil-spencer-asha-sharma-microsoft-xbox-options-whats-next/">What does that even mean?</a>”</p> <p><a href="https://www.windowscentral.com/gaming/xbox/exclusive-talking-to-new-xbox-ceo-asha-sharma-and-cco-matt-booty"><em>Windows Central</em></a> sat down with Sharma and new CCO Matt Booty to ask just that. Instead of clarifying her plans, Sharma offered vaguely positive-sounding platitudes that amounted to little of substance. “For me, the spirit of ‘Return to Xbox’ is about returning to the spirit that the team was founded on,” Sharma said. “It’s that spirit of surprise, it’s the spirit of building something nobody else was willing to try—I’ve heard ‘renegade,’ ‘rebellion,’ and ‘fun’ used. That’s what I was thinking about when I wrote that.”</p>

 <p>Sharma did, at least, acknowledge that she has a lot of work to do before making any big decisions, but it’s bizarre that Microsoft would just set her loose for interviews when she admits she still has so much to learn about Xbox. When asked about Xbox getting rid of game exclusives and whether or not that policy might be revised, she said, “Right now, I need to learn, candidly. About the ‘why’ of these decisions, what we were optimizing for, and what the data says about the Xbox strategy today. That’s the honest answer. I’m looking at lifetime value, not just what happened in a previous moment, or in short term efficiencies and things like that. The plan’s the plan until it’s not the plan.”</p> <p>On the subject of AI, <a href="https://kotaku.com/xboxs-new-boss-promises-not-to-flood-it-with-soulless-ai-slop-2000672087">Sharma reiterated</a> that she wouldn’t “flood [the Xbox] ecosystem with slop,” and said she stands by what she wrote in her introduction email. Booty jumped in with further clarification, adding, “We’ve got no pressure from Microsoft, there are no directives on AI coming down.”</p>

 <p>Overall, the interview is light on concrete details about Sharma’s vision for Xbox. As she said, “I think from here, the work is proof over promise.” We’ll just have to wait and see what that work actually looks like.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/sony-spider-man-universe-reboot-venom-morbius-kraven-2000673365</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Tom Rothman, CEO of Sony Pictures Entertainment Motion Picture Group, told <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7RIBjgm-DdY"><em>The Town with Matt Belloni</em></a> that Sony’s Spider-Man Universe isn’t dead, but it is, as Belloni put it, getting a “fresh reboot” with “new people.” This comes after the box-office and critical bombs of <em>Morbius</em>, <em>Madame Web</em>, and <em>Kraven the Hunter </em>over the last three years.</p> <p>The backlash to <em>Morbius</em> and <em>Madame Web</em> alone was enough for <a href="https://kotaku.com/kraven-the-hunter-spiderman-jc-chandor-1851707831"><em>Kraven the Hunter</em> director J.C. Chandor to plead before the film’s release</a>, “People have got to give us a chance and come out and support this film, and literally try to wash away some of the other stuff that’s happened. Give our film a chance.” But <em>Kraven</em> turned out to be just as bad as the others. Even the most successful films of the bunch, <em>Venom</em>, <em>Venom: Let There Be Carnage</em>, and <a href="https://kotaku.com/venom-last-dance-knull-explained-spider-man-marvel-1851647953"><em>Venom: The Last Dance</em></a>, have been embraced more for their unintentional camp than their actual quality.</p>

 <p>The reboot strategy is one that Sony has tried before with their Marvel characters, and it didn’t go particularly well last time. After producing three well-regarded Spider-Man movies directed by Sam Raimi between 2002 and 2007, the studio brought Marc Webb on to helm a reboot series in 2012. Only two out of the planned three movies were ever made. After that, Sony collaborated with Disney to bring Spider-Man into the massively successful Marvel Cinematic Universe, even though Sony owns the film rights to the character. It was, as Belloni said in the interview, “kind of a tail-between-the-legs moment to have to go to Disney and say, ‘Listen, we kind of ran this into the ground, we need you to bring this back.'”</p> <p>Rothman disputed Belloni’s accounting of how the Disney deal went down, arguing that the MCU crossover has been hugely successful for Sony, but it’s hard to ignore the evidence that Sony has struggled to figure out how to make a good comic book movie on its own. Rothman didn’t share any other details about what a rebooted SSU might look like.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Avowed Doesn’t Have A Typical Romance Mechanic, But That Makes Its Romantic Moments Hit Even Harder]]></title>
            <link>https://kotaku.com/avowed-romance-mechanic-rpg-kai-2000673362</link>
            <guid>1445404</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><span>In the lead-up to the February 2025 release of action RPG </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/avowed-xbox-pc-rpg-game-pass-skyrim-review-kotaku-1851761525"><i><span>Avowed</span></i></a><span>, developer Obsidian Entertainment warned players not to expect any romance in the game. “We are building thoughtful relationships with our companion characters,” game director Carrie Patel told </span><a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/obsidian-explains-why-avowed-wont-let-you-romance-your-companions"><i><span>IGN</span></i></a><span> a full year before its release. “Ultimately, I personally am a fan of making [romance] an option, but I feel like if you’re going to do it, you really, really have to commit and make sure that you’re giving all to fulfilling that in a way that feels both true to the character, but also creates an engaging player experience. So not something we’re doing for </span><i><span>Avowed</span></i><span>, but I wouldn’t say never.”&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>This didn’t come as much of a surprise; though there have been sporadic dalliances with romance in Obsidian’s back catalogue, most notably in </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/pillars-of-eternity-ii-the-kotaku-review-1826397542"><i><span>Pillars of Eternity II: Deadfire</span></i></a><span>, the company has largely eschewed the mechanic, even as it grew in popularity in both the genre and the industry as a whole. So it was a welcome surprise when it turned out that there was, in fact, romance in </span><i><span>Avowed</span></i><span>—but not in the way players would have expected.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><i><span>Avowed</span></i><span> handles romance very differently from most other Western RPGs, and if players went into the game expecting the genre-typical smorgasbord of horny, fuckable party companions, they would have been sorely disappointed. Instead, there’s just one romance in </span><i><span>Avowed</span></i><span>, and it’s composed of only a handful of lines of dialogue and a brief mention in the epilogue. The storyline is more about the romanceable character’s emotional growth and development than their physical attraction to the player character. </span><i><span>Avowed</span></i><span> takes a mechanic that can often feel tacked-on and makes it an integral part of the story. It does exactly what Patel said a good video game romance should—and it’s a breath of fresh air compared to genre norms.</span></p> <h2><strong>How most Western RPGs handle romance</strong></h2> <p><span>We have one-time Western RPG powerhouse BioWare to thank for pioneering romance mechanics in the genre. The studio first introduced romanceable companions in 2000’s </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/baldurs-gate-ii-is-still-one-of-the-greatest-rpgs-ever-1278311582"><i><span>Baldur’s Gate II: Shadows of Amn</span></i></a><span>, and further refined their house style with the </span><i><span>Mass Effect</span></i><span> and </span><i><span>Dragon Age</span></i><span> franchises. A “BioWare-style RPG” has become shorthand for a particular type of game that emphasizes player choice through customizable blank-slate player characters, dialogue options, and branching storylines, and features a large cast of attractive NPCs who you can recruit to join your party and eventually romance.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><span>That “blank slate” approach to romance in RPGs eventually became the de-facto standard industrywide, with games like CD Projekt’s </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/cyberpunk-2077-the-kotaku-review-1845946628"><i><span>Cyberpunk 2077</span></i></a><span> and Larian Studios’ </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/baldurs-gate-3-bg3-review-dungeons-dragons-rpg-larian-1850726491"><i><span>Baldur’s Gate 3</span></i></a><span> carrying on the tradition. The benefit of that approach is that it can be genuinely fun to blow off steam in between high-risk missions by exchanging witty, flirty banter with a hot companion. But there are drawbacks to that method, too. As Patel explained to </span><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/why-arent-there-romances-in-avowed-obsidian-explains"><i><span>Eurogamer</span></i></a><span>, “The more you introduce romance as a mechanic, and the more that you build systems around it, and metrics, and ways for players to bolster and measure their affinity and affection level with other characters, the more it becomes something people engage with as a system rather than as a relationship.” Building an intimate relationship gets boiled down to completing a sidequest checklist, and it can make what should come across as a genuine connection between two characters feel hollow instead. So while BioWare-style RPGs have become known for their inclusion of romance mechanics, it’s pretty rare that the storylines that result from those mechanics actually feel romantic.</span></p>

 <h2><strong>What makes <i>Avowed</i> different</strong></h2> <p><span>In </span><i><span>Avowed</span></i><span> you build your own custom character, an envoy from the Aedyran Empire sent to the lawless Living Lands to investigate rumors of a plague known as the Dreamscourge. In the Living Lands, you recruit four NPCs for your adventuring party, of which you can bring two at a time to explore with you.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>So far, so BioWare. But the companion chats at camp in </span><i><span>Avowed</span></i><span> never take a turn for the romantic. In most similar RPGs, a conversation between the player character and one of their companions about training together would probably be laced with innuendo—in fact, a story about how Turians train and prepare for battle is what leads into Garrus’ famous “</span><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlZtNtzmZeY"><span>reach and flexibility</span></a><span>” line from </span><i><span>Mass Effect 2</span></i><span>. However, during an early conversation about training in </span><i><span>Avowed</span></i><span> between the protagonist and one of their companions, your responses are all focused on what you’d like to improve—learning how to take more damage, strike harder, or a little bit of everything. There’s no hamfisted flirting to be found.</span></p>

 <p><span>As Patel told </span><a href="https://www.windowscentral.com/gaming/xbox/avowed-interview-2024"><i><span>Windows Central</span></i></a><span>, </span><i><span>Avowed</span></i><span>’s companions are “characters who are really tied to the central story [of the game].” The first of those companions you encounter is Kai (voiced by Brandon Keener, who also voiced Garrus in the </span><i><span>Mass Effect</span></i><span> series), an aumauan mercenary carrying a lot of baggage from a lifetime of running away. He was a deserter from the Rauatai Navy; he left his subsequent home, Thirdborn, six years ago and never returned, though he’s cagey on the details of his departure. He’s also got some unfinished business with Tama, the deceased leader of his former mercenary squad, that he’s hesitant to talk about. His backstory, which he slowly reveals to you over a series of contemplative fireside chats, is integral to the plot. It’s also a romance.</span></p> <p><span>Over the course of the game, as Kai opens up about Tama, you can help guide him to the realization that Tama was in love with him—and he was also in love with Tama. Though it’s obvious to the player that, before his death, Tama tried to subtly express his feelings to Kai (there’s a full-on oil painting of Kai in Tama’s house, for fuck’s sake), Kai was too oblivious to pick up on his hints. When the game’s main story eventually takes the party to Thirdborn, it forces Kai to confront why he left and never returned: He walked away from Tama when he was on his deathbed, promising to return quickly, but he never did, because he couldn’t stand the thought of watching Tama die.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>It’s only after you help Kai deal with that trauma that something approaching a romance mechanic kicks in. You can tell Kai that you have feelings for him, though, in typical Kai fashion, you need to fully spell it out for him before he understands what you mean—his obliviousness still runs strong, and you get a good sense of how infuriating it must have been for Tama over the years. Kai’s response to your confession ties back into his personal growth; he tells you that he never thought he’d be able to feel close to someone again after losing Tama, and eventually adds, “If you want to be with me after everything you’ve seen—and if you still feel that way once we’ve finished our journey…I want that, too.” And that’s it. There’s no sex scene, not even an embrace or a kiss. Just a quiet acknowledgement that, because Kai was able to deal with his trauma, he’s ready to move on.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><span>If you choose to romance Kai, you get a short bit of exposition in the epilogue that reflects that as well. “But the most unexpected boon of Kai’s adventures is the romance that blossoms with the envoy. He’d thought his chance at love died with Tama, but after the envoy helped him accept that loss, he realized he’d found another chance with someone who saw him, knew him, and loved him as he was. He wouldn’t let this one pass him by,” it says.</span></p> <p><span>Speaking to </span><i><span>Eurogamer</span></i><span>, Patel explained the hidden romance option. “There’s nothing that says ‘hey this is a thing that can happen’—there’s no system that’s going to track your status with them—but if you’re doing the kinds of things that you would do if you were interested in this character, you’ll probably come across the option by the end of the game. And it should feel natural, organic, and surprising,” she said. By removing the “mechanic” part of the romance mechanic, tying it to Kai’s emotional growth, and making it less about the NPC as a vehicle for pure fantasy indulgence, </span><i><span>Avowed</span></i><span> does something truly unexpected: It incorporates romance in a BioWare-style RPG in a way that’s actually romantic.</span></p>

            <title><![CDATA[This Charity Steam Bundle Is One Of The Best Deals I’ve Ever Seen]]></title>
            <link>https://kotaku.com/charity-steam-pc-games-bundle-best-deal-2026-fps-cultic-selaco-boltgun-2000673339</link>
            <guid>1445344</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>A new digital charity bundle available for the next two weeks includes some fantastic boomer shooters like <em>Selaco, Cultic, </em>and <em>Warhammer 40,000: Boltgun. </em>And the whole bundle costs just $17.</p> <p>Over the last few years, <a href="https://kotaku.com/boomer-shooter-retro-fps-dusk-ion-fury-prodeus-1851144571">we’ve seen an influx of retro-inspired first-person shooters</a>, often referred to online as boomer shooters. Not all of them are great. Some are downright terrible. I know, I’ve played a lot of them. Sure, they all include shotguns and fast-moving action. But not all of them feature tight combat and satisfying gunplay. Don’t worry, though, because <a href="https://www.digiphile.co/collections/boomer-shooter-blueprint">Digiphile’s new charity boomer shooter Steam bundle, which is available until March 10</a>, contains only certified bangers.</p> <p>Here’s the full list of what’s in the bundle:</p> <ul> <li><em>Selaco</em></li> <li><em>I Am Your Beast</em></li> <li><em>Mullet Madjack</em></li> <li><em>Beyond Citadel</em></li> <li><em>Warhammer 40,000: Boltgun</em></li> <li><em>Incision</em></li> <li><em>Cultic</em></li> </ul> <p>All of this for just $17 is wild. You could pick any two of these games and they would be worth that price. But all seven for less than $20 is one of the best deals I’ve seen in a long time. Here are a few of my favorites from this bundle and what I had to say about them previously.</p>

 <ul> <li><strong><a href="https://kotaku.com/selaco-gzdoom-engine-fps-steam-review-early-access-1851513067"><em>Selaco</em></a>, a boomer shooter built using the bones of <em>Doom</em></strong><em> – “Selaco </em>is a more polished, well-made, and fun FPS than some AAA shooters I’ve played in recent years developed by massive teams using modern engines and big budgets. And this thing is technically in early access! In fact, I bet as you play&nbsp;<em>Selaco&nbsp;</em>you’ll quickly forget all about its&nbsp;<em>Doom&nbsp;</em>origins as you run around its large, hand-crafted campaign maps filled with different enemies, puzzles, and loads of secrets.”</li> <li><strong><a href="https://kotaku.com/warhammer-40000-40k-boltgun-review-retro-fps-shooter-1850466690"><em>Warhammer 40,000: Boltgun</em></a>, a gory retro shooter with modern ideas</strong> – “<em>Boltgun&nbsp;</em>is crunchy and retro in all the right ways, with sliders letting you make the game more or less pixelated or modern-looking. You can, for example, turn off some of the fancier lighting effects and lower the resolution to create a very early ‘90s shooter feel, or turn all that stuff up and get something that looks more like a late-PS1-era shooter.”</li> <li><strong><em><a href="https://kotaku.com/mullet-madjack-anime-fps-roguelike-hades-review-steam-1851475865">Mullet Madjack</a>,</em> an FPS all about killing rich robots</strong> – “In 2024, billionaires and AI have become some of our biggest enemies. So it’s nice to have&nbsp;<em>Mullet Madjack</em>, a game that lets me mow down a bunch of rich-robot assholes using assault rifles and shotguns. It’s even better that the game is one of 2024’s best, thanks to its solid world-building, awesome visuals, and incredibly fast action. The future might suck, but at least it’ll be fun!”</li> </ul> <p>So yeah, great bundle of games. <a href="https://www.digiphile.co/collections/boomer-shooter-blueprint">And the charity that this bundle is supporting</a> is all about helping protect whales and dolphins. Get some great boomer shooters and save a few whales? What more could you ask for?</p>
