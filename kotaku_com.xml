            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Senators Richard Blumenthal and Elizabeth Warren have called on the Treasury Department to hit the brakes on Saudi Arabia’s private-equity-backed buyout of Electronic Arts over national security concerns, including the deal giving a foreign country unfettered access to “sensitive consumer data.” They’ve demanded an investigation into the risks associated with the unprecedented agreement which is expected to earn a $500 million windfall for the banking partners involved in the fees alone.</p> <p>“We urge you and the Committee to apply searching scrutiny to this unprecedented, proposed foreign privatization of a major American technology and entertainment company and request that you provide the Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations and Senate Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs information on how CFIUS (Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States) plans to ensure that the national security risks arising from the proposed acquisition may be mitigated,” the Democratic senators <a href="https://www.hsgac.senate.gov/wp-content/uploads/2025-10-14-Letter-from-Blumenthal-and-Warren-to-Secretary-Bessent-re-Electronic-Arts.pdf">wrote in a letter</a> to Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent this week.</p>

 <p>It goes on to outline some of their concerns:</p> <blockquote><p>The PIF’s control over EA’s operations could extend to influencing or directing the company’s design, features, and product decisions to advance the Saudi government’s specific and long-term objectives. PIF would be well positioned to dictate or veto what stories are told to Americans through the popular medium of video games, controlling narratives about U.S. history and culture. In short, the Saudi government’s ability to exert its influence through EA would offer the authoritarian regime an effective tool to project power worldwide. As one analyst observed, “Saudi Arabia clearly recognizes the political and cultural influence of video games, especially among young people.”</p></blockquote> <p>In addition to asking for guarantees from the Trump Administration that it’s investigated national security risks associated with the deal and how to mitigate them, the letter also calls for information about any communications the Treasury Department had with Jared Kushner ahead of the buyout’s announcement. Trump’s son-in-law is one of the members of the “consortium” that’s acquiring EA and <a href="https://kotaku.com/ea-saudi-bioware-ai-lgbtq-debt-junk-bond-2000630647">prior reporting claimed</a> his connections to the president would be instrumental in helping it avoid regulatory scrutiny.</p>

 <h2>“EA is not a struggling company”</h2> <p>United Videogame Workers-CWA, a direct-join, industry-wide video game union with the Communications Workers of America, has also called for regulators to investigate the threat of mass layoffs associated with the acquisition. “If jobs are lost or studios are closed due to this deal, that would be a choice, not a necessity, made to pad investors’ pockets—not to strengthen the company,” the group <a href="https://cwa-union.org/news/releases/united-videogame-workers-cwa-statement-proposed-electronic-arts-buyout">wrote in a statement</a> on Thursday.</p>

 <p>It continued, “We are calling on regulators and elected officials to scrutinize this deal and ensure that any path forward protects jobs, preserves creative freedom, and keeps decision-making accountable to the workers who make EA successful.” The group is now <a href="https://actionnetwork.org/petitions/make-ea-better">circulating a petition</a> for fans and developers to write to the Federal Trade Commission in support of investigating the terms of the deal more closely.</p>

 <p>While the CWA has made major in-roads with unionizing game workers at Microsoft-owned studios thanks to a <a href="https://aftermath.site/battle-net-workers-unionize-blizzard-entertainment-cwa">soon-to-sunset labor neutrality agreement</a>, that organizing effort hasn’t yet resulted in unionized shops at places like EA. The leveraged buyout, set to complete sometime in mid-2027, could be the catalyst for teams at Respawn Entertainment or other EA-owned studios to seek union membership.</p>

 <h2>A $500 million windfall for Wall Street</h2> <p>While the exact terms of the buyout are still unknown, <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-10-13/ea-buyout-why-jpmorgan-and-other-banks-have-so-much-riding-on-deal?utm_source=substack&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;embedded-checkout=true"><em>Bloomberg</em> reports</a> that the banking partners involved are set to make a small fortune just from the fees associated with it. Roughly $20 billion of the $55 billion acquisition will be debt-financed, with JP Morgan organizing the loan. <em>Bloomberg c</em>alls it the “biggest debt commitment ever by a single lender for an LBO [leveraged buyout].”</p>

 <p>That’s a lot of risk for EA, which would need to begin servicing high interest rates on the debt as part of the deal, and it’s led to fears that a new round of mass budget cuts and staff layoffs will follow if the merger is approved. While some analysts have argued that going private could free the publisher to pursue longer-term creative visions, it could just as well be an anchor that makes it more cash-hungry than ever.</p> <p>Banks, on the other hand, could make out either way. Anyone helping JP Morgan underwrite the debt will be in line for a piece of the roughly $500 million in banking fees that <em>Bloomberg</em> estimates the deal will bring in. EA’s c-suite will also be in position for a premium payout on all of their stock awards over the years. Most of EA’s employees, on the other hand, will be rewarded with fresh fears of layoffs.</p>

              <p>Specialty <em>Street Fighter s</em>andwiches are coming to select McDonald’s restaurants in Japan. The collaboration was revealed earlier today with a slick SNES-looking promo that made me want to grab my old 16-bit console back out of the closet. But while the food is inspired by<em> Street Fighter II</em>, there’s also a burger voting contest in <em>Street Fighter VI</em> right now complete with a new McDonalds-themed costume for Vega.</p> <p>The “Street Burgers” go on sale next week for a limited time, <a href="https://www.famitsu.com/article/202510/55254">according to <em>Famitsu</em>,</a> and feature a teriyaki burger with an egg on it, a sweet and sour fried chicken sandwich, and a triple cheeseburger. What exactly do those combinations have to do with <em>Street Fighter</em> icons like Ryu, Ken, and Chun-Li? No idea. But it’s neat and I want them.</p>

 <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="ja" dir="ltr">喰らえ！うまいやつを！ <a href="https://t.co/GpdKbCU5QN">pic.twitter.com/GpdKbCU5QN</a></p> <p>— マクドナルド (@McDonaldsJapan) <a href="https://twitter.com/McDonaldsJapan/status/1978634498175639955?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 16, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <p>Unfortunately, they’re only available in Japan and I don’t have any international flights coming up. I’ll settle for watching someone on Instagram do the taste test in the weeks ahead. While the promo is supposed to get people to buy from McDonald’s, it’ll probably just get me to dip back into the <em>Street Fighter 30th Anniversary Collection</em> for a mini-impromptu arcade session instead.</p> <p>In addition to the sandwiches, the “Street Burger” event also features an “Overflowing Energy” McFizz that appears to be sparkling apple juice, and a McFloat that adds a scoop of soft-serve ice cream on top. That one you can definitely make at home if you’re feeling tempted.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[I Miss Old-School Camera Angles In Horror Games]]></title>
            <link>https://kotaku.com/resident-evil-silent-hill-retro-camera-third-person-2000636061</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/i-miss-old-school-camera-angles-in-horror-games.1326589/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>There’s <a href="https://youtu.be/YRtWz4NVYXA">a fun moment</a> in <i>Metal Gear Solid 4: Guns of the Patriots</i> where, if you position the camera over Snake’s head while standing in a location from the first <i>MGS</i>, Snake will deliver the following line:</p> <blockquote><p>Ah. Overhead view. Just like old times. Now you’re talking. Overhead view. That’s more like it.</p></blockquote> <p>It’s a reference, of course, to what had been the default camera style of <i>Metal Gear Solid</i> for quite some time, as well as many action games from earlier eras. But where I really think this style of fixed, or at least independent, camera angles shined was in old school 3D horror games. And in recently playing two older horror titles–the first <i>Silent Hill</i> and <i>Resident Evil 0</i>–I’ve found myself quoting Snake, sharing his enthusiasm for what those classic camera angles deliver.</p> <p>The pivot in recent decades that’s seen every big-budget action game, horror or not, need to be third- or first-person started, I suspect, after <i>Resident Evil 4</i> made such a huge splash in 2005. iIt was certainly not the first game to use such a perspective, but it marked a huge, and hugely successful, departure for <i>RE </i>as a series–so successful that it may have made more fixed camera angles start to feel dated and obsolete. I think we’ve lost something in that mass transition, a special kind of experience that made for some unique cinematic moments. And nowhere is this more apparent than in horror games. Consider this early moment from <i>Silent Hill</i>:</p>

  <p>The way the camera pulls back from Harry and twists over the alleyway adds to the unnerving sense that you’re entering some kind of strange reality; there’s a sense of control that’s taken away from you as the player. Moments like this aren’t possible when the camera is tethered to a character’s back like it is in modern games; it certainly wouldn’t feel as seamless and dreamlike if a modern third-person action game just yanked the camera control away from the playerEven in describing this moment, I’m using a kind of language I rarely do when talking about in modern games: What the camera is <i>doing</i>, how it frames the <i>scene</i>.</p>

 <figure id="attachment_2000636062" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000636062"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000636062">© Screenshot: Konami / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p>But this lack of control over the camera also adds to the horror. In replaying <i>SH</i> recently, I’ve noticed that without that control, the foggy alleyways of Silent Hill and the dark rusted spaces of the Otherworld also feel less in my control, amplifying the fear and adding a bit of directorial intention behind how a scene was framed.</p>

 <p>The original <i>Resident Evil</i> games demonstrate this well, too. Take <a href="https://youtu.be/2_dn-L9hPLM?t=5579">this scene in the first <i>RE</i></a>. As Chris descends the stairs, the camera remains at the top with a Dutch angle (a term we’d rarely use to describe an interactive scene in a modern action game). It makes the stairs feel more ominous. It conveys a feeling of descending into the unknown that wouldn’t be there without an independent camera that intentionally framed the action in a certain way.</p>

   <p>I also love how camera shifts change the sense of place in these games. Again, original <i>Resident Evil </i>games do this all the time and to great effect. Early on in <i>Resident Evil 0</i>, Rebecca encounters a massive scorpion. Standard stuff for <i>RE</i>. But first, in a cutscene, she hears it outside of the train she’s exploring. And <a href="https://youtu.be/Anm_F89z7ks?t=1497">just before you leave the room</a>, the camera shifts to a position outside the train, where we can see Rebecca through a window. The audio also shifts to place you outside of the train. You can hear the wind, the drops of rain pelting the plate glass of the window. You can’t see the monster yet, but you know it’s out there; it’s a preview of that outside space where you know the monster is lurking, waiting to pounce, and it conveys a cinematic sense of space, one that stretches beyond the location of your character.</p>   <p>Don’t get me wrong: I love a good third-person shooter with a freely rotatable camera. But there’s a cinematic language that we just don’t see as often in games anymore with the death of fixed and independent cameras. It makes me wish that in addition to first- and third-person perspectives in the upcoming <i>Resident Evil: Requiem</i>, there’d also be a classic, cinematic style camera as well.</p>

              <p>If you’ve dabbled at all in playing the original <i>Doom</i> or <i>Doom 2</i> on PC, you’ve likely used GZDoom before: It’s one of many “source ports” of the original <i>Doom </i>engine out there. Some ports are more suited for multiplayer, others offer more modern features like jumping and freelook (heathens!), and GZDoom is arguably the most popular after 20 years of history in the <i>Doom</i> modding scene.</p> <p><b>Read More:</b> <a href="https://kotaku.com/openai-chatgpt-erotica-mental-health-age-verification-sam-altman-2000635632">OpenAI Is Pivoting To Porn</a></p> <p>A fork from the previously popular ZDoom, it was published by Christoph Oelckers, known as Graf Zahl, in 2005. Graf has a reputation in the scene as somewhat of a feather ruffler, sometimes <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/HobbyDrama/comments/ns6jbe/video_games_how_an_avantgarde_doom_mod_angered_an/">described as “elitist</a>” and prone to rash actions–the latest of which was sticking some <a href="https://kotaku.com/openai-chatgpt-erotica-mental-health-age-verification-sam-altman-2000635632">ChatGPT-written code</a> into GZDoom and, well, it’s going down about as well as you might expect.</p>

 <h2>Graf Zahl on using AI-written code: ‘fuck it!’</h2> <p>Graf Zahl justified his use of AI-written code in an amusing <a href="https://github.com/Zdoom/gzdoom/commit/584af500736b0317e42824f39285ed3d954fc4e2">exchange on GitHub</a> (h/t <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/doom-modders-fall-into-civil-war-as-devs-launch-new-engine-in-protest-at-gzdoom-creators-leadership-and-use-of-chatgpt"><i>Rock Paper Shotgun</i></a>), saying in response to someone taking issue with it:</p> <blockquote><p>everybody is using AI for boilerplate code these days those who act as unreasonable as you did here will lose out in the end and be ridiculed.</p></blockquote> <p>This silliness follows a public <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/10/many-developers-leave-gzdoom-due-to-leader-conflicts-and-fork-it-into-uzdoom/">declaration on GZDoom’s Discord</a> that some folks working on the project were leaving their work on GZDoom behind to start work on a new fork, <a href="https://github.com/UZDoom/UZDoom">UZDoom</a>, which aims to carry over all of GZDoom’s beloved features. Unsurprisingly, “conflict [with] GZDoom’s lead developer/maintainer Graf Zahl” sparked the schism.</p>

 <h2>‘Ohh God please no. Spare gzdoom from the drama’</h2> <p>A <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/boomershooters/comments/1o6yw7o/important_announcement_regarding_the_gzdoom/">now-locked post</a> over on r/boomershooters gives further insight into how Zahl’s actions have gone over with the community. “Ohh God please no. Spare gzdoom from the drama” reads one post, speaking to the frustration over the inclusion of the code and the inevitable back and forth Internet Debates™ likely to spawn from any discussion of AI and LLMs.</p>

 <p>As <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/boomershooters/comments/1o6yw7o/comment/njk1pxu/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button">one comment thread documents</a>, the LLM-added code was rejected and “it’s safe to say that the only versions of the port that have this wonky code are the latest dev builds,” meaning current public releases are likely still AI-free.</p> <p>Who knows how long that’ll last, though? Might be time to consider a new source port for your favorite WADs.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><span>An Aipom’s paw curls today. </span><i><span>Pokémon Legends: Z-A </span></i><span>is out now, and that means that all those </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-legends-z-a-mega-evolution-list-new-all-switch-2000621380"><span>leaked Mega Evolutions are real</span></a><span>, and fans must contend with all these new forms of their old faves. Starmie, the ethereal, possibly alien starfish Pokémon, is one of the monsters that I have loved for years, even if it didn’t quite make it on my team in most games outside of Generation I. The jewel-wearing Pokémon has had plenty of fan-made Mega Evolution concepts that lean into its inherent beauty and possible cosmic origins. Game Freak had an opportunity to make a Mega Starmie worthy of the original, and instead, we got one of the silliest, least interesting Mega Evolutions in the series.</span></p>  <p><span>Mega Starmie was one of the many </span><i><span>Legends: Z-A </span></i><span>Mega Evolutions whose description leaked ahead of the game, and essentially it boiled down to “its limbs get longer.” Yes, Mega Starmie’s arms and legs grow, giving it more humanoid proportions, but that doesn’t sum up just how goofy this thing looks as it’s running around on two legs. I had known about Mega Starmie’s concept for months, and even I wasn’t prepared for the horror of watching a once elegant, unknowable Pokémon turn into a cunty gremlin version of Patrick Star from </span><i><span>SpongeBob SquarePants</span></i><span>. I had months to process the basic concept, but a lot of fans aren’t watching leaks in the months leading up to launch and are just now seeing this monstrosity. Many are not taking it well, or at least they’re making some good shitposts.</span></p>

            <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">Truly<br>one of the creatures to have been designed <a href="https://t.co/NgzUN7CgLx">pic.twitter.com/NgzUN7CgLx</a></p> <p>— Pr Quote (@pr_quote) <a href="https://twitter.com/pr_quote/status/1978681819772944711?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 16, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <p><span>According to the Pokédex,&nbsp; Mega Starmie’s more humanlike behavior could either be an attempt to communicate with humankind or something more insidious, like trying to replace humans. Both of those thoughts are equally horrifying because if Starmie isn’t trying to supplant us, it’s saying we all run around like something out of a Hanna-Barbera cartoon? That’s a sick burn, actually.</span></p>

 <p><span>The concept of a Starmie with longer limbs isn’t inherently the problem, as fans have been making mock-ups of the design based on the leaked description for months, and there are some cool ones out there.&nbsp;</span></p>    <p><i><span>Legends: Z-A </span></i><span>adds over 20 new Mega Evolutions, and while there are some bangers, I am a bit disappointed in the cool-to-goofy ratio. I love me a silly little guy, but a lot of these Mega Evolutions come off more like gags than anything else. At least I have Mega Raichu to look forward to </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-legends-z-a-mega-raichu-evolution-x-y-paid-dlc-2000625371"><span>when the </span><i><span>Mega Dimension </span></i><span>DLC comes out</span></a><span>.</span></p>
