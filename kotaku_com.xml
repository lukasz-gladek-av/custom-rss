With a complete battle system overhaul and fantastic quality-of-life features like fast travel and no more random encounters, <em>Raidou Remastered</em> is a much smoother adventure than it was almost 20 years ago.</p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="196572" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="The Week In Games: A Rebirth, A Remake, And A Remaster" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="94" data-playlist="196572,196055,196646" data-current="196572"><div><p>The Week In Games: A Rebirth, A Remake, And A Remaster</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196572/196572_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196572/196572_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196572/196572_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196572/196572_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/22127.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>As a spin-off of the<em> Shin Megami Tensei </em>series, the Raidou games are much shorter, so don’t worry about having to sink in 100 hours like you would have to for <em>Persona</em> or <em>Metaphor: ReFantazio</em>. With this remaster on modern platforms comes additional tasks to complete if you want to fully complete everything it has to offer. Get ready to explore 1920s Japan with our ace detective, Raidou Kuzunoha XIV!</p><h2 id="h53288"><a id=""></a>How long is <em>Raidou Remastered: The Mystery of the Soulless Army</em>?</h2><p><em>Raidou Remastered </em>is split into 12 different story chapters that can take up asmuch time as you want. In between fusing demons and fighting you can easily pile on the hours throughout the game. However, <strong>if you’re looking to just go along the critical path with minimal side content, you’re looking at about 25-30 hours of playtime to finish the last chapter of the game.</strong></p><figure id="" data-id="35034c22b5dd73b8925022cb72c2b5ef" data-recommend-id="image://35034c22b5dd73b8925022cb72c2b5ef" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The characters explore a city." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="The characters explore a city." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="false" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Atlus</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="35034c22b5dd73b8925022cb72c2b5ef" data-recommend-id="image://35034c22b5dd73b8925022cb72c2b5ef" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The characters explore a city." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>To unlock all of the game’s Trophies/Achievements, you’re going to have to complete the Devil Chart (the Demon/Persona Compendium for all you <em>SMT</em> and <em>Persona</em> fans), solve all Case Files (side quests), and defeat all of the game’s optional super bosses. <strong>This can add upwards to 30 more hours of gameplay, especially considering that this remaster has included over 50 new demons to the original’s 70, bringing the grand total to more than 120 demons</strong>. So be prepared to spend a lot of time fusing all of the demons!</p><p>There are also two new difficulty modes. The easier one is called Sleuth, which allows you to experience the story without any significantly hard combat encounters and no game-overs if Raidou falls in battle.</p><figure id="" data-id="fe3baa3e7f6cc6cd2552b5782bc98639" data-recommend-id="image://fe3baa3e7f6cc6cd2552b5782bc98639" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The main character battles demons." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="The main character battles demons." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="false" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Atlus</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="fe3baa3e7f6cc6cd2552b5782bc98639" data-recommend-id="image://fe3baa3e7f6cc6cd2552b5782bc98639" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The main character battles demons." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>The other mode is called Detective Legend, which is the hardest difficulty in the game. It can only be unlocked in New Game+ after completing the story at least once. Beating the game on Detective Legend also unlocks a Trophy/Achievement, so you’ll need to do at least two playthroughs in order to earn all of the Trophies/Achievements, which add up to a total of 50-60 hours alone.</p><hr><p><br><em>Raidou Remastered: The Mystery of the Soulless Army</em> is available now for PS5, Xbox Series X/S, Switch 2, and Windows PCs.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://kotaku.com/nintendo-switch-2-welcome-tour-worth-it-how-long-beat-1851784828<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Nintendo has a history of packing in tutorial games with some of their hardware, so players were reasonably frustrated to find that <em>Nintendo Switch 2 Welcome Tour</em> would run them $10. But while this tutorial-focused title should’ve probably just been included with the Nintendo Switch 2, it may still be worth buying for certain folks who will benefit from learning more about their new system. </p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="197565" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="Nintendo Switch 2 Could Launch With Almost No Reviews" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="122" data-playlist="197565,197567,195670" data-current="197565"><div><p>Nintendo Switch 2 Could Launch With Almost No Reviews</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197565/197565_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197565/197565_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197565/197565_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/23089.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>Whether you’re a long-time gamer or new to the hobby, you’re probably curious about how long <em>Nintendo Switch 2 Welcome Tour</em> will take to beat and whether it’s even worth that price tag. Let’s take a look.</p><h2 id="h286893"><a id=""></a>How long is <em>Nintendo Switch 2 Welcome Tour</em>, and is it worth buying?</h2><p>Alright, let’s get real for a second. Much of <em>Nintendo Switch 2 Welcome Tour</em> is just reading and following prompts or engaging in simplistic mini-games, so it’s more of an interactive exhibit than a game you “beat.” But if your goal is to check off plenty of tutorial segments and get some of the medals in the mini-games, <strong>you’ll be able to squeeze a few hours of fun out of this strange little game</strong>.</p><p>For the $10 price tag, <em>Nintendo Switch 2 Welcome Tour</em> provides a pretty solid look at all of the Nintendo Switch 2's unique features. There’s a whole lot of useful stuff you can learn here, and it’s delivered in a bright and colorful package that certainly feels very “Nintendo” in design. But at the end of the day, it’s a glorified tutorial, meaning that its worth will be largely determined by whether you feel like you need help learning how everything works.</p><p>With this in mind, gaming enthusiasts who likely knew how every feature works on the Switch 2 before they even got their hands on one aren’t likely to benefit greatly from the information in <em>Nintendo Switch 2 Welcome Tour</em>—though it’s worth noting that some of the mini-games can be fun. Younger or less experienced players may enjoy learning how to make the most of their new hardware, especially things like Joy-Con functionality and attachment, or even general safety.</p><p>We don’t want kids trying to eat the Joy-Cons, after all. They taste terrible anyway. Or so I hear. I wouldn’t know, of course. Can we move on?</p><p>Anyway, the bottom line is that <em>Nintendo Switch 2 Welcome Tour</em> would have made a great pack-in title, but it still may be worth the $10 for particular demographics. So, just make your decision based on your gaming experience and whether you enjoy quirky mini-games. As for me, I think I’ll be ripping some <em>Mario Kart World</em> instead.</p><p>If <em>Nintendo Switch 2 Welcome Tour</em> sounds like a worthwhile purchase for you, it’s available now exclusively for, well, Nintendo Switch 2. It’s literally in the name. Don’t be weird.</p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Yesterday, when having coffee with a friend, I opened the app to try to remember what it was that the director of the extraordinary sci-fi film <em>Primer</em> had done that meant he wouldn’t be working again. (Accrued repeated accusations of domestic violence, if you’re wondering.) But before I could, I was asked by Wikipedia if I would like to play a game. Um, sure! So my chum and I were entirely sidetracked into playing <em>Which Came First</em>, an incredibly simple concept in which the app gives two short descriptions of historical events, plus sometimes a small picture clue, and asks you which happened first. That’s it. It’s great!</p><blockquote data-type="BlockQuote"><p>Which came first?</p><p>Deputies of the French Third Estate take the Tennis Court Oath.</p><p>The U.S. vessel SS Savannah arrives at Liverpool, United Kingdom. It is the first steam-propelled vessel to cross the Atlantic, although most of the journey is made under sail.</p></blockquote><p>That’s the first question of today’s edition. I haven’t the faintest idea! I didn’t have a clue about any of the five questions yesterday, either. My historical knowledge is, without question, <em>atrocious</em>. Thankfully, Paul’s a far more rounded, smarter man than me, and was able to make educated or even informed guesses, and “we” got four out of five! Woo!</p><p>OK, so obviously this isn’t the most groundbreaking of puzzle ideas. But actually, it’s a perfect addition to Wikipedia, because it’s entirely about <em>finding out something new</em>. I may be sitting here wondering literally which century we’re in with that above question, but I’m also dying to know more about the “Tennis Court Oath” now! It’s also wild to realize that the United States Congress adopted the Great Seal around the same era King Louis XVI was trying to flee the French Revolution. I mean, you may say “Duh,” and deeply worry about the standard of British education in the ‘80s and ‘90s, and you’d likely be right to. If my dad were alive to hear my ignorance, he’d be immediately dead again. But, and this is a lifelong philosophy of mine, you never mock someone for not knowing something if they’re willing to learn it <em>now</em>.</p><p>And, with respect to that, Wikipedia’s little game offers direct routes toward some knowledge. At the end of the five questions you’re given your score and streak as you’d expect, but also a nicely presented list of all the articles relevant to the questions you were asked, and indeed dictionary definitions for specific words and terms. Today’s has an excellent 34 boxes to click on for more information, as general as “<span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Holocaust&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Holocaust" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Holocaust</a></span>” and as specific as “<span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kazimierz_Piechowski&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kazimierz_Piechowski" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Kazimierz Piechowski</a></span>.” And indeed, I’m pleased to say, a tile for the <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tennis_Court_Oath&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tennis_Court_Oath" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Tennis Court Oath</a></span>.</p><figure id="" data-id="9c1c63a6866d55e076cf9eae7f043b31" data-recommend-id="image://9c1c63a6866d55e076cf9eae7f043b31" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="720" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The results page for today's game." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="The results page for today's game." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Wikimedia Foundation / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="9c1c63a6866d55e076cf9eae7f043b31" data-recommend-id="image://9c1c63a6866d55e076cf9eae7f043b31" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="720" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The results page for today's game." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>When trying to find out more information about Wikipedia’s game, not least whether I’m embarrassingly late to discovering it or one of the first to be offered it, I find there’s the weirdest lack of information out there.

In fact, the game’s own <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://m.mediawiki.org/wiki/Wikimedia_Apps/Team/Android/TriviaGame&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://m.mediawiki.org/wiki/Wikimedia_Apps/Team/Android/TriviaGame" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">“more info” link</a></span> goes to an empty page! (I have, of course, reached out to Wikipedia to ask all about it.) However, I <em>have</em> discovered that it began on May 20, 2025, because that’s how far back the archive of daily games goes. So a month today! Hopefully you can now find it yourself by opening the updated version of the Wikipedia app on your phone. And hopefully it’ll catch on and become a whole section within the app.</p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
