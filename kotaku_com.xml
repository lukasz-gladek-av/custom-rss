              <p>Storage problems are common, but they don’t have to hold you back. If your current devices are overflowing with files, media content, and projects, it’s high time you grab a spacious external hard drive to get things moving again.</p>
<p>Depending on the capacity you’re after, these can cost a pretty penny, but not today. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6342/">The WD 6TB portable external hard drive for PC and Mac is going for $137 at Amazon right now, after a sweet $33 discount</a>. It’s spacious enough to house all your important data, and the compact size makes it easy to carry your entire library with you, wherever you go.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6342/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Stores All Your Important Files</h2>
<p>This portable drive works with both Windows and Mac. It comes formatted for Windows 10, 8.1, and 7.1, meaning you can just plug it into the USB 3.0/2.0 port of your device using the included cable to start transferring your files; no additional drivers needed. Users of Mac and other operating systems will need to reformat it manually, but the process is fairly straightforward and shouldn’t take more than a few minutes. Once all is set, you’re going to enjoy fast transfers, even when moving large files around.</p>
<p>It’s great for both work professionals and creatives looking to offload heavy stuff that’s taking up a lot of space on the internal drive. The 6TB capacity is quite spacious, and easily capable of housing thousands of high-resolution photos, hundreds of old and new videos, massive creative projects, long research papers, large office documents, and even your favorite gaming titles. We won’t say it’s a forever storage solution, because our needs will grow faster than you think, but it’ll still take you a long way before you need to upgrade again. Think at least a couple of years, unless you’re trying to create an unusually large creative or gaming library.</p>



<p>Its compact size and portability are another strong selling point. It sits nicely on your desk without taking up a lot of space, and slides into any backpack easily, without bulking things up. You’ll be able to take all your important stuff with you on the go; just plug it into your laptop or a remote desktop when you’re out and about, and access whatever you need instantly!</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6342/">On a regular day, this drive would run you around $170, but the current 19% discount drops it to just $137.</a> It’s also the lowest we have seen it drop to in the last 30 days. If 6TB is more than what you need, there are several other configurations available, all of which are discounted. For instance, the 1TB version is sitting at just $59. You can also grab the 2TB model for $70, or the 4TB option for $114. Additionally, if you’re someone who deals with large chunks of data for different tasks on a regular basis, it’s also a good time to pick up a couple of these!</p>

              <p>Nintendo has just added a new game to its collection of GameCube Classics for the Switch 2’s Online + Expansion Pack subscription: 3D platform game <em>Wario World</em>.</p> <p>I’ve always loved the very existence of Wario. Antithesis villain characters are woefully underused in the realm of video games, despite those that we’re familiar with being so bloody brilliant. Wario, Shadow the Hedgehog…um… See! Oh wait, there was that Evil Crash Bandicoot that one time, right? But where’s a goatee-wearing Joel Miller who sides with the infected? Or a mirror world of mustachioed Pokémon, looking to capture human trainers in silver, spiky balls? (You know what the real problem is? In trying to think of examples for this dumb joke, I realized that nearly all video game leads these days are already antiheroes, which sucks.)</p> <p>Wario is the perfect platonic example of an antithesis character, the result of flipping an ‘M’ upside down and the pure evil that results. Yes, I have enormous love for Waluigi, but Wario is the OG. And let’s be honest, “Waluigi” is a semantic stretch. “Wario” is so clever not just because it invokes a Mario from the Upside Down, but because <i>warui</i> (悪い) literally means “bad.” No notes.</p>

 <p><em>Wario World</em> was the gold-loving monster’s first outing that wasn’t on a handheld. (Wario jokes at the start of the game that “I’ve always been stuck in those liquid crystal displays, but not anymore!”) While not made in-house at Nintendo—instead by Treasure, the team that brought us&nbsp;<em>Gunstar Heroes</em> and <em>Bangai-O</em>—it was clearly inspired by the design of <em>Mario 64</em>, albeit with a fixed camera, but with a much greater focus on combat.</p>

  <p>And it was good! Not great, not a <em>Mario</em>-like game-changing event, but a good, solid and extremely busy action-platformer. However, the concerns on its original 2003 release are somewhat lessened with the passing of time, not least the contentious nature of its brevity and price.&nbsp;<em>Wario World</em> was a premium game, but over in eight hours, and that sucked. But in 2025, when it’s the latest addition in a subscription pack you most likely pay for so you can play Switch games online, that issue becomes far less important. The retracing your steps and over-reliance on boss fights will still irk, but hey, it&nbsp;<em>feels</em> like it was free.</p> <p><em>Wario World</em> joins <em>The Legend of Zelda: The Wind Waker</em>, <em>F-ZERO GX</em>, <em>Soulcalibur II</em>, <em>Mario Smash Football</em>, <em>Chibi-Robo!</em> and <em>Luigi’s Mansion</em> in the GameCube Classics collection. Still to be added but said to be coming soon are <em>Super Mario Sunshine</em>, <em>Fire Emblem: Path of Radiance</em>, <em>Pokémon XD: Gale of Darkness</em> and&nbsp;<em>Pokémon Colosseum</em>.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/amazon-starts-offloading-amd-ryzen-7-at-an-all-time-low-in-cpu-clearance-push-2000652290</link>
            <guid>1379449</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>PC gamers know that the hunt for the best processors for their rigs usually boils down to speed and cores, and they also know an unlocked processor can be pushed beyond its factory-set limits for maximum performance. A sneaky-good unlocked gaming processor just hit Amazon’s sale shelf — <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6341/">the AMD Ryzen 7 5800XT, an unlocked chip ready to be overclocked, is just $183 after a 27% price drop.</a></p>
<p>The next-gen chips bring fatter spec sheets and sexier reviews, but the 5800XT’s 8 cores and 16 threads built on AMD’s proven-winner Zen 3 platform brings a base clock speed of 3.8GHz which can be boosted all the way to 4.8GHz. It’s loaded with 32MB of L3 cache and 4MB of L2, with PCIe 4.0 support, DDR4-3200 memory compatibility, and — very important for a chip that’s going to get a ton of overclocking — AMD’s Wraith Prism cooler to prevent heat-related failure.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6341/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Second Life</h2>
<p>If you’re building your own rig from scratch, the 5800XT is a solid midrange choice to build around, and this Amazon deal makes its price virtually unbeatable. You’ll be saving hundreds of dollars by skipping the next-gen chip and still enjoying power and speed suitable for online gaming.</p>
<p>The ideal shopper for this deal, however, might be anyone with an older and slower PC who’s caught between gutting out another year or two with a subpar machine, or biting the budgetary bullet and going all-in on an all-new machine. The latter choice could run you well into the high hundreds or even low four figures. But by opting for the 5800XT for just $183 and doing a quick, easy swapout, that older machine probably gains years of new life as a much faster and more efficient gaming rig.</p>



<h2>More Than Gaming</h2>
<p>The 5800XT is listed as a gaming processor, and it definitely lives up to that label. But the 36MB of cache is impressively generous, and the 5800XT also supports DDR4-3200 memory, which means it will be able to transder data with the same great speed it games with. Data access speeds are also well above average, so whatever PC you add the 5800XT to will also be more than capable of being a productivity workhorse or media center for streaming and storage.</p>
<p>PCIe 4.0 compatibility on X570 and B550 motherboards is the final piece if the puzzle for this great Amazon deal on the Ryzen 7 5800XT processor, because it future-proofs your new build or revamped PC by giving it compatibility with next-gen components without forcing you to overspend on an entirely new machine or a next-gen processor. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6341/">This deal is the best $187 brain transplant you can perform on an older PC</a>, or the best $187 nerve center around which to build an entirely new machine from scratch.</p>

              <p>Jim Ward, sometimes know as James Kevin Ward, was a voice actor and radio host, best known for providing the wonderful voice of&nbsp;<em>Ratchet &amp; Clank</em>‘s buffoonish antihero Captain Qwark. It was <a href="https://x.com/StephMillerShow/status/1998881395167604759">announced</a> last night (via&nbsp;<a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/news/2025/12/jim-ward-voice-of-ratchet-and-clanks-captain-qwark-has-passed-away"><em>PushSquare</em></a>)&nbsp;that he has died at the age of 66.</p> <p>Jim Ward was perhaps more recently most recognized as a co-host on the nationally syndicated talk radio program,&nbsp;<em>The Stephanie Miller Show</em>, but to video games players it’s almost certainly Captain Qwark who would first come to mind. The hilarious character, all bravado and little talent, was so deftly performed by Ward such that he was<em>&nbsp;just</em> likable enough to be both a glorious antagonist, then later a hilariously useless ally, across most of the series of games.</p>

 <p>However, Ward was recognizable in so many other games, as well as his many TV and movie roles (especially as Doug Dimmadome and Chet Ubetcha in&nbsp;<em>Fairly Odd Parents</em>). In 1998 he was the voice of Hector LeMans in&nbsp;<em>Grim Fandango</em>, became a regular in multiple <em>Star Wars</em> games, appeared as <em>FEAR</em>‘s Rodney Betters,&nbsp;<em>Diablo III</em>‘s Belial, as well as roles in&nbsp;<em>Metal Gear Solid 3</em>,&nbsp;<em>Batman: Arkham Knight</em>, and&nbsp;<em>BioShock 2</em>, among many dozens of others.</p>

 <p>Ward had retired in 2021, due to a combination of precocious Alzheimer’s and an extremely serious case of covid-19 that had left him paralyzed for months. After a slow recovery from the sickness, he had entirely lost his memory. (Rather wonderfully, despite this, he apparently would still perform voices and entertain his family.) This obviously meant <a href="https://www.playstationlifestyle.net/2021/05/12/ratchet-clank-jim-ward/">he was unable to reprise his role</a> for 2021’s <em>Ratchet &amp; Clank: Rift Apart</em>, where he was replaced by <span data-testid="hero__primary-text">Scott Whyte, but his voice has continued appearing in more recent games such as&nbsp;<em>The Elder Scrolls Online</em>‘s&nbsp;<em>Gold Road</em> expansion and last year’s remaster of <em>The Thing</em>.</span></p> <p>Ward’s death was publicly announced by his former radio colleague Stephanie Miller, who quoted from an email sent to her by Ward’s wife on December 10. “One of the saddest messages I have ever received,” she began, quoting, “<span>Our wonderful ‘voice deity’ as Steph anointed Jim Ward, passed away today at 10:45AM. Can you let Steph know? Thanks, Janice.”</span></p> <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">One of the saddest messages I have ever received from the amazing Mrs Jim Ward:<br> Our wonderful “voice deity” as Steph anointed Jim Ward, passed away today at 10:45AM. Can you let Steph know?

We wish all the best to his surviving family and friends.</p>
