              <p>Bethesda creative director Todd Howard knows the wait for the next <em>Elder Scrolls</em> RPG has been “too long.” But in a new interview, he once again asked fans to be patient, and hinted that maybe <em>Elder Scrolls 6</em> or some other Bethesda game in the future might shadow-drop without warning.</p>

 <p><a href="https://www.gq-magazine.co.uk/article/fallout-4-anniversary-todd-howard-interview">In an interview with&nbsp;<em>GQ Magazine</em></a>&nbsp;mainly focused on the 10th anniversary of<a href="https://kotaku.com/fallout-4-the-kotaku-review-1743410637"><em> Fallout 4,</em></a> Howard talked about the studio’s next game: <em><a href="https://kotaku.com/elder-scrolls-vi-6-tes6-update-release-date-bethesda-1851363646">The Elder Scrolls VI</a>.</em> First announced officially in 2018 via an E3 teaser, this next entry in the RPG franchise will be the first sequel since 2011’s <em>Skyrim</em>. And while Howard admits working on Starfield after <em>Fallout 4</em> was a nice “reset” for the team, he also acknowledges that the gap between sequels is too big.</p>

 <p>“I do like to have a break between them, where it isn’t like a ‘plus one’ sequel,” said Howard. “I think it’s also good for an audience to have a break – <em>The Elder Scrolls</em>&nbsp;has been too long, let’s be clear. But we wanted to do something new with&nbsp;<em>Starfield</em>. We needed a creative reset.” Howard also made it clear that <em>The Elder Scrolls 6</em> is still a “long way off.”</p>

 <p>“I’m preaching patience. I don’t want fans to feel anxious,” Howard told the outlet. Previously, the creative director suggested that Bethesda had announced the new RPG <a href="https://kotaku.com/todd-howard-elder-scrolls-vi-6-2018-e3-teaser-early-1850770820">too early.</a></p> <h2><em>Elder Scrolls 6</em> (or something else…) might get shadow-dropped</h2> <p>Elsewhere in the interview, after admitting that <em>Fallout 4</em>‘s dialogue system wasn’t well received by fans, Howard talked about letting some folks who donated to Make-A-Wish play<em> Elder Scrolls 6</em> early via a recent playtesting session. And yes, Bethesda is playtesting the RPG a lot now as it’s the studio’s next big project. But it seems like Howard isn’t a fan of spending years and years teasing and talking about Bethesda’s next game.</p>

 <p>I like to just announce stuff and release it,” said Howard. “My perfect version–and I’m not saying this is going to happen–is that it’s going to be a while and then, one day, the [<em>The Elder Scrolls 6</em>] will just appear.”</p>

 <p>When the interviewer pointed out that Bethesda shadow-dropped <a href="https://kotaku.com/bethesdas-oblivion-remaster-is-out-now-on-xbox-ps5-an-1851777265"><em>The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion Remastered</em> earlier this year</a>, and it was a big hit, Howard vaguely teased: “You might say that was a test run. It worked out well.”</p> <p>Now, I don’t actually think Bethesda and Xbox will just launch the next mainline <em>Elder Scrolls</em> game without a marketing push. That would be wild. But I do think <em>Oblivion Remastered</em> proved that many of Bethesda’s past games are popular enough already that you don’t need to do much marketing to get people excited about a new version of a past classic. And over the last year or two, we’ve heard rumors and reports of a <a href="https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Fallout_3_remaster"><em>Fallout 3</em> remaster</a> being cooked up. <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/7-years-after-it-was-announced-the-elder-scrolls-6-is-still-a-long-way-off-todd-howard-says/#google_vignette">And <em>VGC</em> reports that a <em>Fallout 3 r</em>emaster is in development.</a> Is Howard’s answer here alluding to that rumored remaster dropping without warning in the near future? Perhaps. <a href="https://kotaku.com/todd-howard-bethesda-fallout-day-fallout-5-tease-event-remaster-2000638661">We know more <em>Fallout</em> projects are coming</a>. Just what those are and when we should expect them are still officially unknown.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/bose-offloads-its-27-inch-dolby-atmos-soundbar-now-selling-at-a-new-record-low-on-amazon-only-2000642388</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/bose-offloads-its-27-inch-dolby-atmos-soundbar-now-selling-at-a-new-record-low-on-amazon-only.1348843/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Modern flatscreen TVs give you crystal-clear pictures but their razor-thin designs leave almost no room for decent speakers, so you end up with tinny audio that degrades your viewing experience. The B<strong>ose Dolby Atmos soundbar remedies this basic problem</strong>&nbsp;and makes your TV’s sound go from underwhelming to truly immersive, and<a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5419/"> right now it’s just $399 at Amazon, down from its usual $499</a>. That’s a n<strong>ew all-time low</strong> on Bose’s compact all-in-one soundbar that crams theater-quality audio into a 27-inch frame.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5419/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>



<h2>How Bose Packed Theater Sound Into 27 Inches</h2>
<p>The acoustic engineering inside this soundbar defies what you’d expect from such a compact unit: <strong>Bose squeezed five separate transducers into the frame</strong>&nbsp;including two upward-firing drivers that bounce sound off your ceiling to create height channels for Dolby Atmos content. This upward projection simulates the overhead audio effects you’d get from ceiling-mounted speakers in a proper home theater, making helicopters sound like they’re flying above you and rain feel like it’s falling from the sky. The <em>TrueSpace</em> technology takes this further by analyzing non-Atmos content like standard stereo or 5.1 surround mixes and intelligently upmixing them into immersive multi-channel experiences. That means even<strong> older movies, regular TV shows, and music benefit from spatial processing</strong> that adds depth and dimension to the soundstage.</p>



<p>AI Dialogue Mode addresses one of the biggest beefs with modern content: mumbly dialogue mixed too low beneath music and effects. This <strong>smart processing evens out vocal frequencies against background noises</strong> which brings conversations to the front of the mix without making the dialogue sound artificially separated or processed. You’ll finally catch every word of dialogue on those prestige dramas when the actors are whispering dramatically, and you won’t miss any plot-critical conversations during action sequences.</p>



<p>The streaming capabilities baked into this soundbar make it <strong>more than just a device to improve your TV audio</strong>. Bluetooth allows you to stream music directly from your phone, while Apple AirPlay 2 offers higher-quality wireless audio if you’re using an iOS device, along with multi-room audio if you have other AirPlay speakers. Spotify Connect lets you start music on your phone and then hand off playback to the soundbar, so you can use Spotify’s app as a remote control while the soundbar pulls audio directly from the service for better quality than Bluetooth streaming.</p>



<p>Setup simplicity makes this soundbar approachable even if you are not particularly tech-savvy: A single HDMI connection to your TV handles both audio from the TV and pass-through for connected devices like game consoles or streaming boxes, eliminating the tangle of cables that usually comes with traditional surround sound systems. The soundbar automatically detects when you’ve turned on your television and powers up accordingly, providing a seamless experience where you’re not thinking of the audio system separately from your television. The <strong>compact width of 27 inches fits comfortably in front of most televisions</strong> without blocking much of the view or overwhelming smaller entertainment centers and the low profile maintains a clutter-free aesthetic in your living space.</p>
<p>The<strong> sound quality this bar produces competes with multi-speaker setups</strong> costing considerably more. The bass response reaches surprisingly low for a soundbar without a separate subwoofer, offering enough low-end impact for most content without adding another box to your room. The clarity across the frequency range ensures instruments remain distinct in complex musical passages and that sound effects maintain their character rather than blurring together.</p>
<p>At $399, it’s the most affordable way into premium TV audio from Bose with the brand’s signature sound at the lowest price this model has ever seen. It checks off all the boxes that include Dolby Atmos support.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/switch-2-black-firday-sales-2025-mario-zelda-2000642413</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><p>
                  It's slim pickings for those hoping to snag a great deal from the Switch 2 maker this holiday season
                </p><div>
              
              <p>I guess it’s that time of year again already. Nintendo just announced its sales for Black Friday 2025 and they are…not that impressive. Unsurprisingly, <a href="https://kotaku.com/nintendo-switch-2-impressions-launch-games-comparison-1851785748">the Switch 2</a> remains full price. But there’s also no discounted Switch bundle in sight, and the slate of Switch games that are on sale for up to $30 off aren’t exactly the cream of the crop.</p>

 <p>Let’s start with which deals the <a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20251110046253/en/Nintendo-Announces-Holiday-Offers-for-Black-Friday-and-Cyber-Monday-2025">Nintendo Black Friday 2025 sale</a> does include. First, Samsung MicroSD Express Cards for Switch 2 will be $20 off at select stores starting November 30. Second, a handful of <em>Zelda</em> and <em>Street Fighter</em> 6 amiibo will be $10 off. Finally, here are the Nintendo games that will be discounted starting November 23:</p>

 <ul> <li><strong><i>Princess Peach: Showtime! </i></strong>– $40 (33 percent off)</li> <li><strong><i>The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom </i></strong>– $40 (33 percent off)</li> <li><strong><i>Donkey Kong Country Returns HD </i></strong>– $40 (33 percent off)</li> <li><strong><i>Luigi’s Mansion 3 </i></strong>– $40 (33 percent off)</li> <li><strong><i>Kirby’s Return to Dream Land Deluxe</i></strong> – $40 (33 percent off)</li> <li><strong><i>Super Mario Odyssey</i></strong> – $30 (50 percent off)</li> <li><strong><i>Nintendo Switch Sports </i></strong>– $30 (50 percent off)</li> <li><strong><i>Paper Mario: The Thousand-Year Door </i></strong>– $30 (50 percent off)</li> <li><i><strong>Splatoon 3</strong> </i>– $30 (50 percent off)</li> </ul> <p>Most of these are either B-tier releases or came out quite a while ago. There’s no <em>The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild</em> or <em>Tears of the Kingdom</em>, and <em>Mario Kart</em> is MIA as well. Other retailers might run their own discounts on physical Nintendo games, but it seems pretty clear the company is treating much of its back catalog as functionally brand-new releases for potential new Switch 2 owners this holiday.</p>

 <h2>RIP Switch Black Friday bundles</h2> <p>While Walmart, Target, and other retailers could still do their own deals, it’s disappointing that Nintendo seems to have retired the Switch bundles that it had been hauling out every Christmas for <a href="https://kotaku.com/nintendo-switch-black-friday-2024-deals-mk8-zelda-totk-1851696187">the last couple years</a>. There’s no <em>Mario Kart 8 Deluxe</em> bundle for the OG Switch or Switch OLED, and no returning Switch Lite sale. Combined with the <a href="https://kotaku.com/switch-2-price-hike-nintendo-inflation-tariffs-2000614220">price increases over the summer</a>, the older hardware will actually be more expensive this holiday than last.</p> <p>The lack of any special Switch 2 deals from Nintendo isn’t surprising at all. In fact, the $500<em> Mario Kart World</em> bundle the console launched with was essentially already that, giving you the hardware and game for $30 below the regular MSRP. I guess fans should just be thankful that Nintendo hasn’t raised the price of the Switch 2 yet and has plenty of stock for the end of 2025. The company said it doesn’t <a href="https://kotaku.com/switch-2-price-hike-nintendo-sale-discount-2000642086">foresee any more price hikes</a> in the immediate future, unless another unexpected trade war erupts.</p>

              <p>If you want to enjoy your favorite titles on the go without compromising on performance, you need a solid gaming laptop. The best ones out there offer a balanced combination of power, sufficient RAM and storage, plus a high refresh rate display. Of course, as you’d expect, such options don’t come cheap. On a regular day, you can expect to pay over $2,000 for a machine this capable. Thankfully, that changes today.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5414/">Amazon is now offering the latest 14-inch Razer Blade gaming laptop for $1,800, after a nice 14% off its regular price of $2,100</a>. We know it’s still an investment even at its discounted rate, but definitely one that’s worth it, considering all the features you’re getting here. It’s an early Black Friday deal, but we can’t say how long it’ll stick around. If it’s been on your radar, now is the time to act.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5414/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>



<h2>Superior Performance for Both Work and Play</h2>
<p>This laptop packs the NVIDIA GeForce RTX 5070 GPU, paired with 115W TGP and DLSS 4 support for higher quality frames and immersive visuals that can bring any scene to life. It’s powered by AMD’s new Ryzen AI 9&nbsp;365 processor, which offers up to 50 Tera Operations Per Second (TOPS) and delivers 200% more AI processing power than the previous Blade 14. This translates into much better overall performance, especially if you’re working with AI tools that usually demand a lot from your system. This also makes the laptop a great option for creatives who frequently use resource-intensive programs for their projects.</p>
<p>Then there’s 32GB of LPDDR5X RAM running at 8000MHz for faster multitasking, as well as a 1TB SSD to store everything you own.</p>



<p>As for the visuals, you’re getting a 14-inch 3K OLED display with a 120Hz refresh rate and 0.2ms response time. It’s not the biggest screen out there, but it’s spacious enough to enjoy your games without feeling cramped. The display is also Calman Verified, which means it’s going to ensure accurate color reproduction consistently. You can expect visuals to look exactly how the creator intended, whether you’re gaming or streaming your favorite show.</p>
<p>Despite all this power, the laptop is quite lightweight and compact. The vapor chamber cooling system keeps it cool during long gaming sessions without sacrificing performance. And speaking of extended use, the 72Wh battery offers up to 11 hours of usage on a single charge. You can go an entire day without worrying about plugging it in!</p>

With <i>Arc</i>’s all-time concurrent player count hitting 462,488 at the time of this writing,&nbsp;the survival-based PvPvE shooter’s player peak outstrips&nbsp;<i data-stringify-type="italic">Helldivers 2</i>‘s top count of 458,709 by just a few thousand players. And with the game holding at 208,000 concurrent Steam players at the time of writing, it doesn’t look like it’s going to stop for a breather.</p>

 <p><i>Helldivers 2</i> wasn’t the only shooter surpassed by <i>Arc Raiders</i> this weekend. <i>Battlefield 6</i> was also left behind as Embark Studios’ new shooter hit the cherished number-three spot in <a href="https://steamdb.info/charts/">Steam’s most-played games</a>, behind <i>Dota 2</i> and <i>Counter-Strike 2</i> (like breaking the laws of thermodynamics, it would take an act of god to see those two games dethroned for any meaningful amount of time).</p>

 <h2>Bitter PvP skirmishes aren’t souring the fun of <i>Arc Raiders</i></h2> <p>Prior to its launch, it was natural to be skeptical of <i>Arc Raiders</i>’ potential to appeal to a wider crowd than previous games in its genre have. Extraction shooters haven’t been the smash hit that, say, battle royales or even hero shooters have been, and for some players the PvP element of <i>Arc Raiders</i> can make for a disruptive, uncomfortable experience.</p>

   <p>But as <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ArcRaiders/comments/1oncgsr/i_mean_this_in_the_most_respectful_way_possible/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button">a recent Reddit post</a> with over 9,000 (sorry) upvotes confirms, fans of the extraction shooter are eager to accept the brutal, sometimes unfair-feeling outcomes that spontaneous PvP can generate, especially when those encounters involve extraction camping, which is when folks intentionally wait for others to extract before jumping them when they least expect it.</p> <p><b>Read More:</b> <a href="https://kotaku.com/arc-raiders-skills-mobility-survival-conditioning-solo-2000641789"><i>Arc Raiders</i>: The Best Skills For Solo And Team Play</a></p> <p>On said Reddit post, many are chiming in about alternative strategies for dealing with extraction campers, namely the use of escape hatches which you can either find or craft keys for. This, I’d wager, is a perfect example of why I think <i>Arc Raiders</i> is proving such a hit: The game is eager to help you find ways to get around uncomfortable situations. On top of its varied progression systems, <i>Arc Raiders</i> asks players to invest in strategic solutions to difficult problems and it seems to be working out well.</p>
