But if this new film has you all excited about the series again and you want to play a <em>Mission: Impossible</em> video game, well, bad news: It’s been over 20 years since the last one. That’s not cool. It’s time for a new <em>MI</em> game!</p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="197567" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="Nintendo Switch 2 Price Is Set at $450 for Now, But Could Go Higher" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="104" data-playlist="197567,197565,197564" data-current="197567"><div><p>Nintendo Switch 2 Price Is Set at $450 for Now, But Could Go Higher</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197567/197567_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197567/197567_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197567/197567_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/23091.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p><em>This article was originally published on July 13, 2023. It has been updated as part of Kotaku’s</em> <em>Mission: Impossible Week. </em></p><p>The <em>Mission: Impossible</em> franchise technically started as <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mission:_Impossible_(1966_TV_series)&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mission:_Impossible_(1966_TV_series)" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">a spy-themed television series from the 1960s</a></span>, which got a sequel series in the ‘80s. But when most people talk about the <em>Mission Impossible</em> franchise in 2025, they are likely referring to the long-running action film franchise starring Tom Cruise that has grown into something much larger and over-the-top than the old TV shows. These films, which began in 1996, typically showcase Cruise risking his life in at least three or four large stunts and also, bizarrely, have only gotten better with each release. A globe-trotting action-adventure franchise that makes tons of money, is loved by critics, and has a massive fanbase seems like ideal material for a video game adaptation. Oddly, that’s not been the case.<br></p><p>Since the beginning of the franchise, only <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Mission:_Impossible_video_games&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Mission:_Impossible_video_games" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">five <em>Mission: Impossible</em> video games have been released</a></span>. (Confusingly, four of them are just named <em>Mission: Impossible</em>.) The first game launched in 1990 for the NES. The second game was released the following year for DOS. These two were based on the 1980s sequel series that aired on ABC.<br></p><p>Then in 1998, two years after the first Tom Cruise film, another <em>Mission: Impossible</em> game launched on the Nintendo 64. This one has some fans, and played a lot like a third-person spin on <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/goldeneye-007-n64-xbox-switch-port-bugs-60-fps-patch-1850041167&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/goldeneye-007-n64-xbox-switch-port-bugs-60-fps-patch-1850041167">Rare’s popular<em> GoldenEye 007</em> game</a></span>. Two years after that, right before the second film hit theaters, a very short and not-good <em>Mission: Impossible</em> game landed on Game Boy Color. However, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://youtu.be/C9qqtcDVHw8?t=294&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://youtu.be/C9qqtcDVHw8?t=294" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">this game did include a neat feature</a></span> that let players use the Game Boy as a remote control.</p><p>Finally, in 2003, <em>Mission: Impossible — Operation Surma</em> launched on PlayStation 2 and later GameCube. This third-person action-adventure spy-thriller takes place between the events of <em>Mission: Impossible II</em> and the third film, but is also never directly referenced in the films and doesn’t even feature the likeness of Tom Cruise. It was essentially a <em>Metal Gear Solid/Splinter Cell </em>clone and in 2025 has been mostly forgotten, like the rest of the<em> M:I</em> video games.<br></p><h2 id="h1292"><a id=""></a><strong>It’s time for a new <em>Mission: Impossible</em> video game</strong></h2><p>And…that’s it! After 2003, we stopped getting new<em> Mission: Impossible</em> games. I understand that the film series hit a six-year lull between the second and third, but after<em>&nbsp;</em>2011’s <em>Ghost Protocol</em>, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://gizmodo.com/mission-impossible-movies-ranked-tom-cruise-mcquarrrie-1850610860?_gl=1*1vdevzg*_ga*MTc0MjY2NTg1OS4xNzQwMzc1OTc4*_ga_V4QNJTT5L0*czE3NDc4NDY2NjIkbzg0JGcxJHQxNzQ3ODQ2NzEyJGoxMCRsMCRoMCRkTGhKQ1VESkJYd2lqTzFUMTlocEx1a0ptWERkbVBiM21jZw..&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://gizmodo.com/mission-impossible-movies-ranked-tom-cruise-mcquarrrie-1850610860?_gl=1*1vdevzg*_ga*MTc0MjY2NTg1OS4xNzQwMzc1OTc4*_ga_V4QNJTT5L0*czE3NDc4NDY2NjIkbzg0JGcxJHQxNzQ3ODQ2NzEyJGoxMCRsMCRoMCRkTGhKQ1VESkJYd2lqTzFUMTlocEx1a0ptWERkbVBiM21jZw..">the franchise kept getting bigger and better</a></span> with each entry. 2018’s <em>Mission: Impossible Fallout</em> is probably the best film in the series. (<em>Dead Reckoning</em>, sadly, couldn’t keep the trend going.)</p><p>And yet, even as the franchise grows bigger and bigger, no new video games are on the horizon. What a shame! So many moments in recent <em>MI </em>films feel almost like setpieces from AAA video games of the last decade. It makes sense to me that this series would translate well into a modern video game.<br></p><p>I understand that over the last decade or so, we’ve stopped getting crappy games based on popular films. And I’ve been mostly fine with that, as the vast majority of games based on films were awful and not worth playing. Then again, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/hitman-studio-s-project-007-will-feature-a-new-james-bo-1846137133&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/hitman-studio-s-project-007-will-feature-a-new-james-bo-1846137133">we <em>are</em> getting a new <em>007</em> game</a></span> from the <em>Hitman </em>devs, and a new <em>Avatar</em> one from Ubisoft, so it’s not like games based on movies are impossible to make these days.<br></p><p>And I think a <em>Mission: Impossible</em> game—if done right and given enough time and resources—could be amazing. Honestly, a game where you just recreate all the famous and dangerous stunts from the films would be great, like a new <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stuntman:_Ignition&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stuntman:_Ignition" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>Stuntman</em></a></span> but based entirely on <em>Mission: Impossible</em> scenes. Actually, it’s been a long time since we got a good <em>Stuntman </em>game, too.<br></p><p>Okay, new plan: Someone convince the right people to fund the development of a new <em>Stuntman</em>-like game based on Tom Cruise’s wildest <em>Mission: Impossible</em> stunts. That’s the game I want. Thank you. <br></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

The new app is available only via Xbox Game Pass for Xbox One, Xbox Series X/S, PC, and streaming. It is available to all Game Pass subscribers, including Game Pass Core members (<span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://support.xbox.com/en-US/help/games-apps/game-issues/retro-classics-known-issues#:~:text=Note%3A%20Retro%20Classics%20is%20only%20available%20to%20Game%20Pass%20Standard%2C%20PC%20Game%20Pass%20and%20Game%20Pass%20Ultimate%20members%20in%20Japan.%20Retro%20Classics%20will%20not%20be%20available%20for%20Game%20Pass%20Core%20members%20in%20Japan.&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://support.xbox.com/en-US/help/games-apps/game-issues/retro-classics-known-issues#:~:text=Note%3A%20Retro%20Classics%20is%20only%20available%20to%20Game%20Pass%20Standard%2C%20PC%20Game%20Pass%20and%20Game%20Pass%20Ultimate%20members%20in%20Japan.%20Retro%20Classics%20will%20not%20be%20available%20for%20Game%20Pass%20Core%20members%20in%20Japan." target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">unless you live in Japan</a></span>). Let’s ignore that it should obviously have been called Xbox Retro Arcade, and instead focus on the new app. </p><p>According to Xbox, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/retro-games-arcade-xbox-x-s-antstream-mortal-kombat-1850669127&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/retro-games-arcade-xbox-x-s-antstream-mortal-kombat-1850669127">Retro Classics is powered by Antstream Arcade’s streaming game tech</a></span>, which is a mostly solid way to instantly play tons of old games across many different platforms. The new app supports challenges, multiplayer, multiple saves, weekly tournaments, user profiles, and leaderboards. And yes, Retro Classics has achievements. Finally, you can get a nifty Xbox achievement for playing <em>River Raid. </em></p><p>“This initiative is a step in our commitment to game preservation and backwards compatibility, allowing players to experience many timeless games on modern devices,” said Xbox in a post on the company’s website. </p><p>So what games are currently available on the Retro <strike>Arcade</strike> Classics app? Here’s some I spotted and tested: <em>Kaboom!, Pitfall, Pitfall 2, River Raid, Grand Prix, Commando, Barnstorming, Fishing Derby, </em>and <em>Mech Warrior 2. </em>Oh and <em>Freddy Pharkas: Frontier Pharmacist</em> is available, too. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://x.com/geoffkeighley/status/1712924798815248487&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://x.com/geoffkeighley/status/1712924798815248487" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">That’s a game that a young Geoff Keighley helped test back in the day</a></span>, long before he had a whole game award show. </p><p>According to Xbox, this is just the start. It plans on adding more Acitivison and Blizzard games to the app in the future. While I’m not a huge fan of streaming old games like this, and would prefer actual downloads and offline play, this is still better than nothing. It’s nice to see Xbox finally digging into Activision’s deep library of classic games and doing something with them after buying the publisher back in 2023. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/microsoft-activision-blizzard-acquisition-game-pass-1850923561&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/microsoft-activision-blizzard-acquisition-game-pass-1850923561">If Microsoft wants to own the entire game industry</a></span>, the least it can do is make it easier to legally play the old stuff it gobbled up in the process.</p><p> .</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
