              <p>The 50-inch size hits the sweet spot for most living rooms and bedrooms, large enough for an immersive viewing experience without overwhelming your space. This <strong>Insignia F50 Series 4K Fire TV</strong> <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5462/">just dropped to an all-time low of $179 on Amazon, down from its regular $299 price</a>. For this price, you’ll get a smart TV equipped with Ultra HD resolution, HDR10 support and built-in Fire TV streaming without the premium pricing that Samsung or LG demand for similar specs.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5462/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>



<h2>4K Resolution That Makes a Difference</h2>
<p>The 3840×2160 resolution supplies <strong>four times the pixel density of standard 1080p displays</strong>&nbsp;which becomes evident when watching nature documentaries or sports where fine details make all the difference. Textures in clothes are finer, individual blades of grass on football fields are more distinguishable, and facial features during close-ups are sharper. The <strong>upscaling engine</strong> takes your existing HD content from cable boxes or Blu-ray players and upscales it to near-4K quality, filling in missing information via intelligent processing. This means that even older shows and movies look better than they did on your previous TV.</p>
<p><strong>HDR10 opens up a wider color gamut</strong> than what standard dynamic range displays can show, and displays subtle gradations in bright skies and shadow details that might otherwise disappear to black. Sunsets contain more layers of orange and red rather than a flat blob of color, and dark movie scenes reveal details in shadows without washing out the overall image. This wider color gamut makes animated films pop with vibrant hues while live-action content receives a more realistic appearance that feels closer to what your eyes see in real life.</p>



<p>The <strong>Fire TV interface puts streaming apps front and center</strong> and removes the need for external streaming sticks or boxes that clutter your entertainment center. Netflix, Prime Video, Disney+, Hulu, and HBO Max load directly from the home screen, and the system remembers where you left off across different services. Voice control through the included Alexa remote lets you search for content by speaking actor names, movie titles, or even vague descriptions.</p>



<p>DTS Virtual-X processing does give simulated surround sound from the TV’s built-in speakers, and furthers dialogue clarity and adding spatial depth to action sequences. It analyzes the audio signal and adjusts the output of the speakers to create an impression of height and width that goes beyond the physical speaker placements. Of course, it is not a replacement for a dedicated sound system, but it considerably enhances the viewing experience compared to the thin, tinny audio that plagues budget TVs.</p>
<p>HDMI eARC support transmits full-resolution audio from streaming apps or connected devices to compatible soundbars and receivers without compression. This type of connection is used to handle more advanced audio formats like Dolby Atmos and DTS:X which need higher bandwidth than the standard HDMI ARC allows. You can attach a soundbar later with no concerns about limitations of audio quality and the automatic switching of the audio output when connecting compatible equipment occurs seamlessly.</p>
<p>The <strong>refresh rate of 60Hz handles standard TV content and movies smoothly,</strong> and refreshed the image 60 times per second so that motion blur does not occur when the camera pans or there is fast action on screen. Smart home integration allows Ring doorbell feeds, Philips Hue lights, or Nest thermostats to be accessed through the TV interface using voice commands. Content from iPhones and iPads can directly mirror onto the screen via Apple AirPlay, without the use of additional casting devices.</p>
<p>But this Insignia TV delivers on most people’s actual usage at a price point of just $179 for a 50-inch 4K display with streaming built in, rather than requiring months of budgeting.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/dell-quietly-offloads-1tb-i7-laptop-on-amazon-73-off-while-official-site-stays-full-price-2000643068</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Dell keeps its official website at full price while quietly clearing inventory through Amazon ahead of Black Friday, and the deals are impossible to ignore. This 15.6-inch business laptop with an <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5461/">Intel Core i7 processor, 1TB SSD storage and 32GB RAM just dropped to an all-time low of $909, slashed from its typical $3,399 price tag</a>. The <strong>73% discount puts enterprise-level computing power within reach of anyone</strong> who needs serious performance without the four-figure price tag.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5461/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>



<h2>Professional Power at Consumer Pricing</h2>
<p>The Intel Core i7-1355U processor brings 10 cores to the table and splits the workload between performance and efficiency cores. This implies that while the efficiency cores handle background applications to save battery, this laptop churns out demanding tasks like compiling code or rendering videos with the performance cores. You can run multiple virtual machines for development work, edit RAW photo files in Lightroom or keep 30 browser tabs open while video conferencing without the system choking.</p>



<p>The 32GB of RAM changes the way you interact with memory-intensive applications: You can load entire databases into memory for faster queries, run multiple Docker containers side by side, or edit 4K video timelines without pre-rendering proxies. This much memory means Chrome won’t slow down when you have research tabs from last week still open and switching between applications happens instantaneously rather than waiting for things to load from disk.</p>



<p>Storage capacity reaches 1TB through NVMe SSD and gives you <strong>read speeds of about 3,500 MB/s and write speeds of about 3,000 MB/s</strong>. These are speeds whereby Windows boots in a number of seconds, applications launch in an instant, and even big file transfers complete before you’ve finished your coffee.</p>
<p>This <strong>15.6-inch FHD runs at a 120Hz refresh rate</strong> which makes scrolling through documents and websites noticeably smoother compared to most 60Hz screens. Text is sharper during rapid scrolling, while the anti-glare coating cuts down on eye strain during long sessions under fluorescent office lights or near windows. The higher refresh rate also serves well in casual gaming during breaks and lends even older games a more responsive feel.</p>
<p><strong>Windows 11 Pro includes several features</strong> that people with Home versions don’t get including BitLocker encryption to protect sensitive files, Remote Desktop for accessing your machine from anywhere, and Hyper-V for running virtual machines. The fingerprint reader is integrated with Windows Hello which means you only need a touch to log in instead of having to type passwords.</p>
<p>Last but not least, <strong>battery life supports a full workday away from outlets</strong>&nbsp;and the rapid charging brings you back to 50 percent capacity in 30 minutes.</p>
<p>At $909 for specs that would normally cost upwards of $3,000, this Dell laptop provides professional computing power at a fraction of the price.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Amazon Is Clearing Out 2025 Laptops, HP’s 14-Inch AI Model Drops to Pennies (65% Off)]]></title>
            <link>https://kotaku.com/amazon-is-clearing-out-2025-laptops-hps-14-inch-ai-model-drops-to-pennies-65-off-2000643061</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/amazon-is-clearing-out-2025-laptops-hp%E2%80%99s-14-inch-ai-model-drops-to-pennies-65-off.1350637/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Most people don’t have $2,000 sitting around for a MacBook and frankly, you might not even need that kind of firepower for everyday computing. HP’s 14-inch AI <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5460/">2025 laptop just hit an all-time low of $379 on Amazon, slashed from its usual $1,099 price tag</a>. The kicker is that <strong>Windows 11 Pro and a year of Office 365 come pre-installed</strong>, and those two software packages alone would normally cost you close to what you’re paying for the entire laptop at this discount.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5460/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>



<h2>Budget Pricing Meets Modern Computing Power</h2>
<p>The Intel N150 processor keeps things running smoothly whether you’re browsing the web, editing documents or streaming videos without the lag that’s so common in cheaper laptops. This chip isn’t going to render 4K video projects in seconds but it launches apps quickly and handles multiple browser tabs without grinding to a halt. You get responsive performance during video calls and enough processing muscle to run Office applications alongside your email and a dozen Chrome tabs.</p>
<p>This laptop features 16GB of DDR4 RAM which makes a big difference when you’re jumping between applications: you can have email open and edit a presentation while streaming music in the background, running antivirus scans, without everything slowing to a crawl. It really means that <strong>Windows 11 runs the way Microsoft intended it to</strong> with smooth transitions and instant app switching.</p>



<p>The <strong>storage setup combines 128GB of universal flash storage with a 256GB microSD card</strong> for a total of 386GB. The UFS storage handles your operating system and most used programs quickly thanks to its high read and write speeds, while the microSD card is there for documents, photos, and media files. In this way, this two-storage solution will keep your system running fast and gives you space for thousands of documents.</p>
<p>Unlike the Home edition, <strong>Windows 11 Pro includes enterprise-level security features</strong> and offers remote desktop capabilities. The Pro version lets you encrypt your hard drive with BitLocker, join corporate domains, and access your computer remotely when you’re traveling. You’ll also get Office 365, which gives you the full Microsoft productivity suite, including Word, Excel, PowerPoint, Outlook, and OneDrive cloud storage, right out of the box. That <strong>subscription generally costs $99 per year alone, while Windows 11 Pro typically adds $199 to a laptop’s sticker price so you’re basically getting the hardware for $80</strong> after accounting for the software value.</p>



<p>A dedicated <strong>AI key for Copilot puts Microsoft’s AI Assistant</strong> just a button-press away. You can ask it to draft emails for you, summarize long documents, generate creative content, and even give tips for troubleshooting without opening a browser or digging through menus. This integration speeds up the workflow when you need fast answers or want to automate repetitive tasks.</p>
<p>The Sky Blue finish adds some nice personality to what’s otherwise a sea of gray and black finishes in the market. It also saves you from having to buy peripherals separately because it includes a Redragon mouse, and it is remarkably lightweight, easy to carry from home to office or coffee shop. You get a full computing package with the $379 asking price, capable of handling daily productivity tasks, coming loaded with premium software and even putting in modern features like AI integration and Wi-Fi 6.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/lego-quietly-offloads-obi-wan-kenobis-starfighter-now-selling-for-pocket-change-on-amazon-2000643056</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>LEGO’s Star Wars line is the brick giant’s most popualr franchise but the company rarely discounts these sets on its own website. Amazon just changed the game by dropping <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5459/">Obi-Wan Kenobi’s Jedi Starfighter to an all-time low of $25, down from its regular $29 price tag</a>. This <strong>282-piece set</strong> from <em>Attack of the Clones</em> gives you the iconic blue starfighter, three minifigures including a debut character and enough playability to keep young Jedi entertained for hours.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5459/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>



<h2>A Starfighter That Delivers on All Fronts</h2>
<p>The build itself captures the <strong>sleek design of Obi-Wan’s Delta-7 Aethersprite-class interceptor</strong> impressively well considering the compact size. You get retractable landing gear that actually works, and gives kids the satisfaction of transforming the ship from flight mode to landed position via a simple mechanism. The cockpit opens smoothly to fit the <strong>Obi-Wan minifigure</strong>, complete with <strong>his blue lightsaber</strong> that stores in dedicated clips on the exterior when he’s flying. Two stud shooters mounted on the wings let you recreate those intense space battles from the Geonosis sequence, and fires with enough force to knock over other LEGO creations without being dangerous.</p>



<p><strong>R4-P17, Obi-Wan’s faithful astromech droid</strong>, gets a special attachment point on the wing where you can place the head of the droid. This detail mirrors how the droid integrates directly into the starfighter in the movies and provides navigation and repair capabilities during missions. The Taun We minifigure marks her first appearance in any LEGO set, which matters to collectors who track these releases. She’s the <strong>Kaminoan</strong> who greets Obi-Wan at the cloning facility and her inclusion adds a narrative element beyond just the starfighter itself.</p>



<p>The finished model <strong>measures 10 inches long, 5 inches wide, and just over 2.5 inches tall</strong>, which makes it substantial enough to display on a shelf without taking up half your bookcase. The proportions work well for swooshing around during play sessions, and construction feels solid enough to survive typical handling from seven-year-olds. LEGO designed this set with a balance between structural integrity and the ability to actually play with it rather than creating a fragile display piece that falls apart if you look at it wrong.</p>
<p>At 282 pieces, you’re looking at<strong> roughly an hour or two of building time</strong> depending on experience level. The instruction booklet breaks everything down into clear steps with color-coded sections so younger builders won’t get frustrated trying to figure out which tiny piece goes where. This piece count hits the sweet spot where it’s engaging enough to feel like an accomplishment but not so overwhelming that kids lose interest halfway through.</p>
<p>The $25 price works out to less than nine cents per piece so this is a pretty comfortable margin below the average LEGO price. Star Wars sets are typically a bit more expensive than average because of the licensing fees, so it’s not common to find one below the usual retail price.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/sony-announces-cheaper-ps5-thats-only-for-japan-2000643085</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/sony-announces-cheaper-ps5-that%E2%80%99s-only-for-japan.1350604/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>During Tuesday’s <a href="https://kotaku.com/playstation-state-of-play-japan-marvel-dragon-quest-2000643049">Japan-focused State of Play</a>, Sony announced a new, cheaper Japanese-language-only PlayStation 5 Digital Edition console that will be available exclusively in Japan. It’s likely a reaction to tariffs in the United States, inflation in Japan, and Nintendo’s own cheaper Japan-only Switch 2.</p>

 <p>On November 11, at the very end of PlayStation’s latest State of Play broadcast, Sony Interactive Entertainment CEO Hideaki Nishino announced “something very special” for gamers in Japan: A Japanese-language-only PS5 console that will cost ¥55,000 yen, which is roughly $350 USD. That same console, <a href="https://kotaku.com/ps5-console-price-increase-sony-america-august-21-2000618873">following a price increase earlier this year</a>, now costs $500 in the United States. Currently, the digital-only PS5 in Japan costs roughly ¥73,000. So if you live in Japan and know the language, you can save quite a bit of money buying this<a href="https://blog.ja.playstation.com/2025/11/12/20251112-ps5/"> cheaper, Japanese-only version of the PS5, which goes on sale on November 21</a>.</p>   <p>As to why Sony is releasing a cheaper, Japan-only PS5, there are a few factors. One of the big ones, <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/f6edb22a-0b19-4073-9e28-ec29b096dde3">as reported by the <em>Financial Times,</em></a> is <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2025/11/07/japanese-real-wages-takaichi-abenomics-inflation-boj-policy.html">rising inflation and the yen losing value</a> in Sony’s home country. And since, as Dr. Serkan Toto, CEO of Tokyo-based game industry consultancy Kantan Games <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/nintendo-will-sell-a-cheaper-330-switch-2-in-japan-thats-region-locked/">told <em>VGC</em></a>, many gamers in Japan don’t care about their consoles being region-locked or restricted to Japanese only, this is a way for Sony to offer a cheaper console to one of its key markets.</p>

 <p>It also makes it harder for resellers and people outside of Japan to snatch up PS5 consoles at a cheaper price, a factor that led to Nintendo offering its very own <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/nintendo-made-a-much-cheaper-japanese-language-only-nintendo-switch-2-and-even-duolingo-is-poking-fun">Japan-only Switch 2 console earlier this year</a>.</p> <p>And yeah, that’s another likely reason for a Japan-only PS5: <a href="https://www.vgchartz.com/article/466071/ps5-outsells-switch-2-ps5-tops-80m-worldwide-hardware-estimates-for-september-2025/#:~:text=by%20over%2051%2C000.-,2025%20year%2Dto%2Ddate%2C%20the%20Nintendo%20Switch%202%20has%20sold%209.24%20million%20units%2C%20the%20PlayStation%205%20has%20sold%20an%20estimated%208.21%20million%20units%2C%20the%20Nintendo%20Switch%201%20has%20sold%203.31%20million%20units%2C%20and%20the%20Xbox%20Series%20X%7CS%20has%20sold%201.69%20million%20units.,-Monthly%20Sales%3A">The Switch 2 is doing very well in the country</a>, and the OG Switch is holding its own, too. Sony’s pricey PS5 is likely too much for consumers in Japan who are struggling with inflation. A cheaper, <a href="https://blog.ja.playstation.com/2025/11/12/20251112-ps5/">region-locked PS5</a> that can’t be easily resold on the grey market could be a big hit in Japan and help Sony regain some ground. It also marks Sony’s first region-locked console since the PlayStation 2.</p> <p>Of course, one more factor in all of this is the ongoing tariffs enacted by President Donald Trump. These tariffs led to Sony raising the price of all PS5 consoles in the United States earlier this year, and a Japan-only PS5 can help the company focus on its local market without having to pay high tariffs or deal with outside buyers. Who had “Region-Locked Consoles Return In 2025” on their horrible bingo card?</p>
