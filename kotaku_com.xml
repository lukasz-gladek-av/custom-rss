              <p>Govee had great deals on Black Friday and Cyber Monday, but those sales are over now. However the company <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5825/">just put this TV backlight (<em>3 Lite</em> model) on sale for a short time, bringing the price down to $58, down from $89</a>, which is the <strong>lowest price we’ve ever seen</strong>, matching the best Black Friday price. Amazon shows that 10% of stock has already moved, and these flash sales typically disappear fast once word gets out.</p>
<p>This lighting system fixes the problem of wanting immersive bias lighting that changes color with what’s on screen instead of just glowing a static color behind your TV. The camera-based sync technology<strong> reads what’s on your screen and projects those colors onto the wall behind your TV.</strong> This makes the room feel more inviting and makes movies and games more immersive.</p>

<h2>How Fish-Eye Correction Makes Sync More Accurate</h2>
<p>The camera on top of your TV records what’s on the screen and analyzes it in real time to<strong> figure out what colors should be on each part of the LED strip</strong>. Traditional ambient lighting systems have trouble being accurate because cameras distort the images they take, especially at the edges where fish-eye warping makes it hard to tell what color it is.</p>
<p>This <strong>model has built-in fish-eye correction</strong> which means that the camera applies inverse distortion to the image it takes before it analyzes colors. This means that the lighting matches what is happening on screen instead of showing vague approximations: You can see this more clearly in scenes with clear color zones, like a sunset on one side of the screen and dark shadows on the other.</p>



<p>The<strong> RGBICW LED setup has red, green, blue, independent cool white, and warm white chips</strong> in each lamp bead. This lets you choose from four different colors for each segment along the strip. This multi-chip design makes the system better at making whites and pastels than RGB-only strips, which make white by mixing red, green, and blue at full brightness. The separate white chips also let you use these lights as functional bias lighting with the right white temperatures when you’re not watching something that needs color sync. The <strong>11.8-foot length is long enough to cover 55-65 inch TVs</strong> with enough strip to run along three sides of the display which makes the wrap-around effect without the need for complicated multi-strip installations.</p>
<p>It takes about 15 to 20 minutes to set up: You just have to clean the back of your TV, stick the LED strip along the edges, put the camera on top of the display, and plug everything into the adapter that comes with it. To accurately detect colors, the camera needs to be able to see your whole screen clearly. So, you should place it in the middle and make sure that soundbars or other equipment don’t block it.</p>



<p>You can also<strong> control the lights through the Govee Home app if you have Wi-Fi</strong>: The app lets you choose from different scene modes, colors, and sync sensitivity settings that change how quickly the lights respond to changes on the screen. You can turn down the reactivity during fast-paced action scenes that would otherwise cause distracting strobing effects, or turn up the sensitivity for subtler content where you want even small color changes to show up in the ambient lighting.</p>
<p>In addition to screen sync, <strong>the system has several preset modes</strong>: These include music sync, which changes colors to the beat of the music, static colors for ambient lighting, and scene modes that are meant for certain moods or activities. In music mode, your phone’s microphone picks up beats and rhythms and makes lights that react to the sound in the room. These other modes make the strip useful for more than just watching movies.</p>
<p>This $31 discount is 34% off which means that premium TV bias lighting is now in the impulse-buy range, where you can try it without making a big financial commitment. For less than the cost of basic RGB strips that don’t have any sync features, you get camera-based screen sync with fish-eye correction, RGBICW color capabilities, and smart home integration.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Ditch Your PS5 Slim, PlayStation 5 Pro at New Record Low If You Want to Play at Pro Level]]></title>
            <link>https://kotaku.com/ditch-your-ps5-slim-playstation-5-pro-at-new-record-low-if-you-want-to-play-at-pro-level-2000650592</link>

              <p>Sony extended Cyber Monday deals by a few extra days with <strong>discounts still active on the PS5 Pro</strong>, DualSense controllers, and PS VR headsets. If you want the <strong>ultimate PlayStation experience with Sony’s most powerful console</strong>, this is it, <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6100/">currently sitting at $648 instead of the usual $749 in a record low deal</a>.</p>
<p>This pricing matters because the performance gap between the Pro and the standard PS5 Slim becomes impossible to ignore once you see games running at their maximum potential. The enhanced GPU, advanced ray tracing, and AI upscaling technology solve the compromises that force regular PS5 owners to choose between fidelity and performance modes in demanding titles.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6100/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>How the Pro Changes the Way You Play Games</h2>
<p>The <strong>PS5 Pro has a GPU with 67% more compute units</strong> than the standard PS5 Slim, and it means that you get higher frame rates and more detailed graphics without having to change the quality settings. The PS5 Slim can only run games at 30 frames per second in fidelity mode, but the <strong>Pro can run them at 60 frames per second</strong> while keeping the same visual quality which means you don’t have to choose between smooth gameplay and beautiful graphics. You can see this right away in games like Spider-Man 2 or Horizon Forbidden West, where the Pro can handle densely populated cityscapes and complicated environments without the performance drops that sometimes happen on the base console during intense action scenes.</p>



<p>PlayStation Spectral Super Resolution uses machine learning to make lower-resolution images look almost like 4K: This is similar to how NVIDIA’s DLSS or AMD’s FSR work on PC graphics cards. The AI algorithm looks at each frame and adds detail that wasn’t there in the original render and makes the images sharper while keeping the frame rate high. This <strong>technology lets games render at 1440p or 1800p inside and output at 4K with clarity that rivals native 4K rendering</strong>. It also keeps the performance headroom needed for 60fps or higher refresh rates.</p>
<p>The PS5 Slim already has great capabilities but advanced ray tracing hardware makes reflections, shadows, and lighting calculations twice as fast. Instead of flat or wrong screen-space approximations, realistic reflections in puddles, windows, and metal surfaces show up with the right depth and clarity. Ray-traced implementations that take into account complex geometry and light sources make shadows that act like real-world physics instead of the harsh, simplified shadows that traditional rasterization makes.</p>



<p>The <strong>console still has great DualSense controller support, fast SSD loading times, and 3D audio processing</strong> which were all things that made the original PS5 so impressive when it came out. Games still load in seconds instead of minutes, and the haptic feedback and adaptive triggers still give players a physical experience that sets PlayStation exclusives apart from games on other platforms.</p>
<p>The base models of the Slim have 1TB or 825GB of storage, <strong>while the base models of the Slim have 2TB</strong>. This is important because modern games often take up more than 100GB of space so here you can keep twice as many games without having to deal with external drives or constantly deleting old games to make room for new ones.</p>
<p>This $101 discount brings the price of premium PlayStation games closer to the price of the base console, but the performance is still worth the difference. You’re getting a machine that doesn’t make you choose between fidelity and performance, doubles your storage space, and makes sure your setup will work with future games that will push hardware harder.</p>
