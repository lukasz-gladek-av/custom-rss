              <p>Robot vacuums span a massive price spectrum where premium models costing $1,000 to $2,000 deliver great performance across all metrics while budget options fluctuate wildly in quality and reliability. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6023/">At $249, down from $449, the iRobot<em> Roomba 105</em> (with auto-empty dock) represents the sweet spot where proven brand reliability meets accessible pricing during Black Friday</a> on Amazon.</p>
<p>iRobot dominates the category through decades of refinement that established <strong>Roomba as the generic term for robot vacuums</strong>, similar to how Kleenex represents tissue. This r<strong>ecord-low deal includes the game-changing auto-empty dock</strong> that transforms occasional convenience into genuine hands-off cleaning.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6023/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>75-Day Self-Emptying That Changes Everything</h2>
<p>The auto-empty dock empties the robot’s dustbin automatically after each cleaning session, and it compresses the dirt into a <strong>big bag that needs to be changed about every 75 days in normal household conditions</strong>. This longer maintenance schedule turns robot vacuums from things that need to be cleaned every week into real <em>“set-and-forget”</em> cleaning tools that can run on their own for months.</p>



<p>The<strong> 70x power-lifting suction of the new Roomba 600 series creates real cleaning power</strong> that pulls embedded pet hair out of carpet fibers, lifts dirt that has been ground into tile grout lines and picks up fine dust particles from hardwood floors. This suction power is on par with that of upright vacuums and it comes from small robotic shapes. This means that robot vacuums can do the same job as traditional vacuums without needing to be used with them.</p>
<p>The <strong>three-stage cleaning system</strong> has a strong suction and a brush that works on both carpet and hard floors. It also has an edge-sweeping brush that pulls dirt out of corners and baseboards that the main brushes can’t reach.</p>
<p><em>ClearView</em><strong> LiDAR navigation maps your home</strong> by measuring distances with lasers, and this makes accurate floor plans that let you clean each room in a planned way instead of randomly bumping into things. The LiDAR sensor accurately measures how far away walls and other obstacles are, and this makes cleaning paths that cover the whole floor plan without missing any spots or having to clean the same areas over and over.</p>



<p>You can<strong> program certain rooms to be cleaned based on your daily schedule</strong> so you can focus on cleaning the areas where you actually live instead of spreading the battery evenly across the whole house: Plan to clean the kitchen after dinner, the bedroom before bed or the living room before guests arrive. You can change the cleaning passes and suction levels to fit the area: For example, you can use the most power on carpets that get a lot of traffic and save battery on areas that don’t get used as much</p>
<p>The <strong>iRobot Home app gives you full control over your robot</strong> and allows you to set up custom cleaning schedules, get time estimates for different tasks, keep an eye on the filter’s life, and set up virtual keep-out zones that stop the robot from going into certain areas. Without physical barriers getting in the way, you can make invisible walls around pet food bowls, fragile floor vases, or rooms that are being remodeled.</p>
<p>At $249, the iRobot Roomba 105 is at 45% below retail this Black Friday. If you want great hands-off floor cleaning with proven brand quality, this record-low price makes premium robotic cleaning accessible without the usual four-figure investment.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/samsung-65-oled-s90f-tv-hits-all-time-low-2025-model-now-cheaper-than-last-years-version-2000648184</link>

              <p>Samsung committed fully to Black Friday by discounting every product category and Amazon delivering the most aggressive pricing across smartphones, tablets, earbuds, and TVs. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6025/">At $1,397, down from $1,997 ($600 off)</a>, the <strong>65-inch OLED S90F featuring the NQ4 AI Gen3 processor, 4K AI upscaling, OLED HDR+, and 144Hz Motion Xcelerator</strong> is the pinnacle of Samsung’s display technology at a record-low price.</p>
<p>This deal applies across all size variants, though the <strong>65-inch model dominates sales</strong> through optimal balance between screen real estate and living room proportions. The 30% discount makes OLED technology accessible at pricing that approached mid-tier LED TVs just years ago.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6025/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Neural Network Processing That Changes Content</h2>
<p>The <strong>NQ4 AI Gen3 processor uses 128 dedicated neural networks</strong> that have been trained on millions of images to look at content frame by frame and make smart improvements that make the picture quality much better. The AI can tell the difference between sports, movies, news, and games and then it processes each type of content in the best way for that type: Sports broadcasts get motion smoothing that cuts down on blur when the camera pans quickly; Movies keep the cinematic frame cadence without the soap opera effect that aggressive processing makes.</p>



<p>The <strong>4K AI upscaling uses the same neural network architecture</strong> to look at lower-resolution content and intelligently fill in missing details to make it look like it was shot in 4K. Cable broadcasts, streaming services that deliver 1080p and older content libraries all get sharper and clearer when you play them back because of edge enhancement, texture synthesis, and noise reduction. The upscaling is especially useful because the content mixes true 4K productions with upscaled or natively lower-resolution material, which keeps the visual quality the same no matter where it comes from.</p>
<p>OLED technology uses self-emissive pixels that <strong>turn completely off when showing black</strong> instead of backlights that leak through, and this gives you perfect blacks and infinite contrast. This basic benefit makes picture quality that LCD panels with local dimming can’t match: It shows shadow detail in dark scenes while keeping bright highlights without blooming or haloing. With HDR content, stars shine against really black space backgrounds, and horror movies show intentional shadow detail instead of washing everything gray.</p>



<p>Motion <em>Xcelerator</em> 144Hz makes motion look smooth by using high refresh rates and smart frame interpolation to cut down on judder and blur during fast action. VRR support <strong>up to 4K 144Hz is good for gaming</strong> because it stops screen tearing and keeps input lag low, which is important for competitive play. When cameras move quickly, sports broadcasts become clearer.</p>
<p>Samsung <em>Vision AI</em> uses scene-by-scene analysis to adjust brightness, contrast and color saturation based on the content and the lighting in the room. The system makes the screen brighter when you watch it during the day in bright rooms and less bright when you watch it at night to keep your eyes from getting tired. Dark scenes get targeted brightening that shows shadow detail without making the whole picture look washed out.</p>
<p>The full range of connections, such as HDMI 2.1 ports, USB inputs, Ethernet, Wi-Fi, and Bluetooth, works with modern gaming consoles, streaming devices, sound systems, and wireless accessories without the need for adapter dongles or connection issues.</p>
<p>If you want the best picture quality Samsung produces, this record-low price makes flagship OLED TVs attainable without waiting years for depreciation.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/lego-goes-full-liquidation-on-santas-sleigh-set-now-selling-at-zero-profit-to-clear-before-christmas-2000648144</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Thanksgiving brings a welcome surprise as <strong>LEGO’s most popular Christmas set returns to Amazon inventory</strong> after two weeks of complete stock depletion that frustrated holiday shoppers. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6021/">At $25, down from $39, the Santa’s Sleigh building set hits a Black Friday price</a> that likely removes LEGO’s profit margin entirely as they race to clear seasonal inventory before Christmas passes and demand evaporates.</p>
<p>The aggressive pricing reflects LEGO’s urgency to move remaining units rather than holding stock that becomes instantly obsolete on December 26th. With over <strong>30,000 units already sold</strong> and limited time remaining before the holiday, this inventory replenishment at record-low pricing creates the optimal purchasing window.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6021/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>343-Piece Build That Is Fun and Challenging</h2>
<p>The <strong>343-piece count gives builders a lot of time to build, about 2 to 3 hours for experienced builders</strong> and even longer for kids working on their first multi-hour LEGO projects. This piece count strikes a good balance between being fun and easy to use. It has enough pieces to keep kids ages 9 and up happy without overwhelming younger builders with too many pieces that make them angry.</p>



<p>The <strong>Santa minifigure and four poseable reindeer figures</strong> that come with it let kids act out Christmas Eve delivery scenes instead of just looking at static displays. The saddles can be taken off and decorated, which lets you personalize them. The<strong> eight wrapped gifts</strong> that can be built also give you props for storytelling which makes the toy more fun to play with after it’s been built. The <strong>guitar, skis, and teddy bear accessories</strong> hint at certain story elements, but they also leave room for people to use their imaginations to figure out whose gifts these are and where Santa brings them.</p>
<p>The <strong>sleigh is 3 inches high, 11.5 inches long, and 2.5 inches wide</strong> which makes it a great holiday decoration that doesn’t take up too much space on mantels or shelves. The size is perfect for showing off on fireplace mantels, entry tables, or holiday vignettes without needing special furniture. LEGO’s precise manufacturing tolerances guarantee that the structure will stay strong even when it is handled carefully and stored once a year.</p>



<p>The set works just as well as a <strong>hands-on gift that the recipient puts together themselves or as a decoration that the gift-giver</strong> puts together before giving it. Kids who get the unbuilt set get to build it and use it at the same time while adults who get pre-assembled sets like how they look right away without having to spend time building them, which they may not have during busy holiday seasons.</p>
<p>Because it’s seasonal, the set naturally follows a pattern of being displayed in December and then packed away with other holiday decorations. This way, it stays fresh each year instead of becoming stale decorations that are always there. This cyclical use makes the perceived value last longer by building up excitement around yearly unpacking traditions that kids look forward to along with other holiday traditions.</p>
<p>LEGO Santa’s Sleigh comes with 343 pieces, a Santa mini-figure, four reindeer and the ability to display Christmas decorations. LEGO’s zero-margin seasonal clearance pricing combined with restocked inventory after 2-week depletion creates the optimal moment to secure this popular set before final sellout.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Razer Ergonomic Gaming Chair Just Hit a Black Friday Record Low, Not Even Prime Day Went This Low]]></title>
            <link>https://kotaku.com/bag-the-razer-iskur-v2-x-ergonomic-gaming-chair-while-its-going-for-just-250-on-amazon-2000647135</link>
            <guid>1366759</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>As someone who’s in front of the screen for several hours a day, six days a week, I can tell you just how important a good-quality chair is. You’re not just sitting on it; it’s providing your upper and lower back, plus arms, the support they need so you can keep working comfortably.</p>
<p>As you’d expect, the best options on the market don’t come cheap. On a regular day, you can expect to pay over $300 for a top-rated option from a known brand. Thankfully, that changes today. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6019/">Right now, you can grab the Razer Iskur V2 X ergonomic gaming chair for just $250, after a nice 17% discount on its retail price of $300.</a></p>
<p>It’s a Black Friday deal, and the offer applies to both black and dark gray color options. The discount, however, ends soon, so it’s best to bag it as soon as you can.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6019/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Adjustable Design With Plush Fabric</h2>
<p>The fabric is cool to the skin and smooth to the touch. Thicker cushion padding molds to the unique shape of your body, while the breathable, multi-layered fibers prevent sweat and moisture buildup during those longer, intense work and play sessions.</p>
<p>The wide seat base is sculpted with reduced edges that distribute the pressure around evenly, which prevents soreness in the buttocks and thighs. It also promotes healthy blood flow, so you won’t have to change positions every few minutes to keep those uncomfortable numbness or tingling sensations away. There’s an integrated lumbar arch that encourages a neutral sitting position with lower back support, because it’s high time you start taking your posture seriously. We don’t mean to creep you out, but Tech Necks don’t just look awkward; they can lead to long-term spine damage and nerve pinching if you don’t make necessary adjustments.</p>
<p>Of course, sitting upright for longer hours can get tiring. To tackle that, the Razer Iskur V2 X has an adjustable recline of up to 152 degrees. Stretch out a bit, and use this mode for relaxing gaming or streaming sessions that don’t require intense focus.</p>



<p>Arms get a break, too. The 2D armrests can be adjusted in height and rotated inwards or outwards for a neutral position. When typing long documents, adjust the height to match your desk and keep them in the outward position for proper arm and wrist support. Planning to relax with a quick gaming session? Pull them inwards for a bit more stability with the console.</p>
<p>The chair is available in two color options, so you can pick whichever suits your aesthetics the best. Go for the black one for a cleaner, classic look. Like your gaming setup with a bit more personality? The dark gray version is going to upgrade the overall look instantly!</p>
<p>This gaming chair does not come pre-assembled, so you’ll need to put it together yourself. The process is straightforward (instruction manual included), and should not take more than 30 minutes. If you’d rather skip the hassle, you can get professional assembly through Amazon for an additional $100.<a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6019/"> To wrap it up, this Black Fridy deal brings the price of this ergonomic gaming chair down to just $250, after a nice $50 discount.</a> It’s great for gamers, work professionals, creatives, and even casual users looking for better support as they use their PC or laptop. It ends soon, though, so it’s best to grab yours before the price goes back up, or the stock ends for good.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Alienware 16 Aurora Gaming Laptop Was Pricier Than a MacBook Air at Launch, Now Black Friday Makes It Even Cheaper Than One]]></title>
            <link>https://kotaku.com/treat-yourself-or-a-gamer-in-your-life-with-the-16-inch-alienware-aurora-gaming-laptop-while-its-discounted-2000648026</link>
            <guid>1366729</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Gaming laptops can cost a pretty penny. The exact price depends on what you’re looking for, but generally, most powerful options from known brands sit well over $1,000, with some even touching $2,500 and above. If a scary price tag has been holding you back from upgrading, we come bearing good news.</p>
<p>Black Friday technically starts tomorrow, but early sales are going in full swing already. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5793/">Thanks to that, Amazon has dropped the price of the 16-inch Alienware Aurora gaming laptop to just $900.</a> You’re saving a straightforward $350 on its retail price of $1,250, and the sale is open to all shoppers. Even better, there are no coupon codes required to score the drop. Just add the laptop to your cart, and the discount applies automatically.</p>
<p>Plus, you can also enjoy the Xbox Game Pass new-user bonus if you’re new to the platform with your purchase. To claim it, click on the “Shop items” option on the deal page. On the following page, add the laptop to your cart. Both the discount and the bonus will apply automatically at checkout. Both deals, however, are expected to expire soon. Act fast before that happens because once it does, there’s no guarantee they’ll return.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5793/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Designed for Everyday Use</h2>
<p>The build is sturdy, flaunting premium materials inside out. Its smaller profile makes it easy to fit into any bag and take it with you on the go, while smoother contours make the laptop comfortable to hold. The 16-inch WQXGA display offers plenty of screen space to play your favorite titles and push creative boundaries, plus delivers bright, sharp visuals consistently. Color accuracy is just as great; greens won’t turn into neon, and yellows won’t feel orange. ComfortView+ integration rounds it all up nicely by actively reducing blue light emission for a more comfortable viewing experience. You won’t be left with eye strain after a single gaming session.</p>
<p>Performance-wise, you’ve got a series 2, 10-core Intel Core 7 processor that’s capable of handling all your demanding day-to-day tasks without throwing a fit. The chip is thoughtfully paired with an NVIDIA GeForce RTX 5050 card. This one balances performance and efficiency like a pro, which makes it an excellent option for gaming at 1080p resolution and performing creative tasks. Multi-frame generation&nbsp;and enhanced Ray Reconstruction support make ultra-smooth frame rates possible, while the Frame Warp reduces the latency even further based on your game’s latest mouse input. The result? A smooth, fluid gaming experience for both the classic titles and the latest releases.</p>



<p>Multitaskers will appreciate the modest 16GB DDR5 RAM. It’s not massive, but still enough to let you work on at least a few different programs at the same time. Spacious capacity comes from the built-in 1TB SSD, which not only lets you house all that you own, but also enjoy fast load and boot times that make it easy to get on with your day without much delay. Despite all this, the laptop stays calm and cool as you go about your day. That’s thanks to its new Cryo-Chamber design that promotes airflow in a quieter way. Another feature that deserves a mention is the backlit keyboard, which lets you use the laptop comfortably even after the shadows fall.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5793/">All in all, it’s a solid gaming laptop, especially at this price. You are currently saving $350 on it, which brings the price down to $900.</a> Considering how most entry-level everyday laptops fall in this range, this one is a steal at under $1,000.</p>
