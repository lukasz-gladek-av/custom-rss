But unlike <em>Half-Life, Abiotic Factor</em> is a survival game like <em>Minecraft </em>or <em>Rust</em>. Here, though, instead of harvesting trees and rocks, you scrounge for pencils and paper, breaking open closets and desks for resources. It’s a very interesting spin on survival, forcing you to build armor out of plastic binders and garbage cans and set up camp in offices and bathrooms. And as you get deeper into the game, you discover alternative dimensions filled with new loot, resources, and dangerous, creepy monsters.</p><p>Here’s the game’s official description courtesy of the Xbox store: </p><blockquote data-type="BlockQuote"><p>After a catastrophic containment breach, your workplace has become a cosmic battle zone: anomalous entities are on the loose, enemies from other dimensions are invading via portals, and an arcane military sect - known as The Order - is targeting personnel and entities indiscriminately, aiming to seize artifacts and put an end to the chaos. Containment procedures have failed and help isn’t on the way.</p><p>Stranded miles beneath the surface, it’s up to you and your fellow scientists to band together, plan your escape, and make this underground complex your new home - for now.</p></blockquote><p>I’ve been playing <em>Abitoitc Factor</em> on and off for about a year now since it came out, and I’m so excited to check it out on console with my group of friends. And the fact that it’s on both Game Pass and PS Plus Extra makes it super easy for me to convince them to give it a spin. You should try it as well! <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/palworld-valheim-minecraft-punch-trees-survival-games-1851193458?_gl=1*use9eu*_ga*MTc0MjY2NTg1OS4xNzQwMzc1OTc4*_ga_V4QNJTT5L0*czE3NTMyOTk5MjEkbzE4MyRnMSR0MTc1MzMwMDA3NCRqNjAkbDAkaDA.&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/palworld-valheim-minecraft-punch-trees-survival-games-1851193458?_gl=1*use9eu*_ga*MTc0MjY2NTg1OS4xNzQwMzc1OTc4*_ga_V4QNJTT5L0*czE3NTMyOTk5MjEkbzE4MyRnMSR0MTc1MzMwMDA3NCRqNjAkbDAkaDA.">I’ve made it clear on this site that I don’t like all the tree-punching</a></span> and cave-living that most survival games involve, and that’s still true. But <em>Abiotic Factor</em>’s contemporary setting and <em>Half-Life</em> vibes really do make it feel different. </p><p>So even if you’re burned out on punching rocks and trees, give<em> Abiotic Factor </em>a go on Xbox Series X/S, PS5, or PC. </p><p>&nbsp;.<br></p></div></div><br/><br/>https://kotaku.com/minecraft-half-life-abiotic-factor-game-pass-ps5-1-0-pc-1851786836]]></content:encoded>

Naturally, poor performance for major titles has led many to wonder when we’ll get a fully fledged successor to the mini PC. While no such thing has been announced or should probably be expected any time soon, the rumor mill is spitting out some interesting fodder for speculation.</p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="196358" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="The Top 10 Most-Played Games On Steam Deck: December 2023 Edition" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="359" data-playlist="196358,195410,196447" data-current="196358"><div><p>The Top 10 Most-Played Games On Steam Deck: December 2023 Edition</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196358/196358_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196358/196358_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196358/196358_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196358/196358_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/21905.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>Valve has been clear that <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.ign.com/articles/dont-expect-a-steam-deck-2-for-at-least-a-couple-of-years-valve-says&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/dont-expect-a-steam-deck-2-for-at-least-a-couple-of-years-valve-says" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">we shouldn’t expect a so-called “Steam Deck 2</a></span>” until it feels there’s enough of a breakthrough in battery-powered processors to warrant a capital-U Upgrade, and in a recent episode of the podcast <em>Moore’s Law Is Dead</em> (ht <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.tomsguide.com/gaming/handheld-gaming/steam-deck-2-rumored-to-be-in-the-works-and-it-may-arrive-with-a-massive-amd-apu-upgrade&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.tomsguide.com/gaming/handheld-gaming/steam-deck-2-rumored-to-be-in-the-works-and-it-may-arrive-with-a-massive-amd-apu-upgrade" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">to <em>Tom’s Guide</em></a></span>), host Tom N/A and YouTuber Jimmy Champagne said that sources within Valve have told them that the company is sticking to that plan. In fact, the silicon that seems likely to power such a future device could put it on par with PS6 performance, or whatever the next Xbox is called (I’m hoping for NeXbox, personally).</p><p>The chip at the heart of all this speculation is the AMD “Magnus” APU, itself only rumored to exist for now. As <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.tomsguide.com/gaming/leaked-amd-magnus-apu-could-power-the-ps6-or-next-xbox-heres-what-weve-heard&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.tomsguide.com/gaming/leaked-amd-magnus-apu-could-power-the-ps6-or-next-xbox-heres-what-weve-heard" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">highlighted by <em>Tom’s Guide</em> last week</a></span>, various internal code names and AMD leaks point to Magnus being a likely candidate for powering next-generation consoles, which the Steam Deck “2” might be aiming to compete more directly with. </p><p>This is good news for those hoping for future Steam Decks to deliver cutting-edge processing power. The rumored Magnus chip might not arrive for another year or two, so we’ll still have to bide our time with the Steam Deck OLED as Valve’s “flagship” handheld for a while. But when we do get that upgrade, it sure sounds like it’s aiming to wow our eyeballs out of our skulls.</p><h2 id="h577138"><a id=""></a>Should the Steam Deck be bigger, better, faster, soon?</h2><p>Please don’t burn me at the stake for being the somewhat luddite-adjacent witch that I am, but I’m content with what the Steam Deck delivers presently. I do not think we “need” a Steam Deck 2, even if <em>Avowed</em> looks like this:<br></p><figure id="" data-id="583b45b78b4c0a979ebff58ca527745f" data-recommend-id="image://583b45b78b4c0a979ebff58ca527745f" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="800" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="NPCs race toward an enemy in Avowed." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="NPCs race toward an enemy in Avowed." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Obsidian / Claire Jackson / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="583b45b78b4c0a979ebff58ca527745f" data-recommend-id="image://583b45b78b4c0a979ebff58ca527745f" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="800" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="NPCs race toward an enemy in Avowed." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Personally, I’ve always rather enjoyed the Steam Deck as a pocket PS4 of sorts. It’s a machine I can use on the go to jump into some titles from the past that aren’t so old as to be something I’d fire up in RetroArch, but aren’t so new that I’m going to be left with 30 minutes worth of battery life after a single play session, either.</p><p>In other words, for now I’m okay with some experiences—<em>Cyberpunk 2077</em> and the like—not being at their absolute best on the handheld. I think it’s fine for there to be experiences that are better had on a PC or console that doesn’t need to offer a compromised version of the game in order to not devour all its battery life in minutes. Valve, I’ll wait for 2030 for a new Deck. My library is big enough and I’m patient.</p><p>.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://kotaku.com/steam-deck-2-amd-magnus-apu-ps6-xbox-1851786832]]></content:encoded>

Reportedly, <em>BF6 </em>will arrive on October 10. The game will be available in two versions: A standard edition and a “Phantom Edition.” This Phantom Edition will be digital only and will include additional in-game content, likely cosmetics. Neither version will provide early access. Pre-orders will go live on July 31. </p><p><em>Battlefield 6</em>'s prices were also leaked, but they are in Euros, and it’s not clear yet how that will translate to the United States and other regions. At the very least, it appears the Phantom Edition will cost $30 more than the standard release. </p><p>Billbil-kun also reports that there will likely be an open beta for<em> Battlefield 6</em> available in August. This follows months and months of closed alpha testing. </p><p>We won’t have to wait long to find out how much of this report and its data-mined information is accurate. Tomorrow, on July 24, EA and its team of studios working on <em>Battlefield 6</em> will unveil the first trailer for the game, and we’ll likely be told its official release date and more. </p><p> .<br></p></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://kotaku.com/bf6-battlefield-6-leak-october-launch-early-access-beta-1851786824]]></content:encoded>

I think we increased production runs on it 4x pre-release. It was substantially by many, many very high double-digit percentages ahead of any other production run we’ve ever done, and we left the market wanting more.”</p><p>That might come as a surprise to fans who have struggled to find <em>MTG</em> booster packs and Commander decks for the <em>Final Fantasy</em> set, with stock selling out during advance pre-order periods and then being marked up over MSRP at some locations by the time it hit store shelves. But critics who sometimes claim that Wizards of the Coast artificially limits supply to drive hype and engagement should be happy to know that the company intends to keep selling new <em>Final Fantasy </em>stock for a while yet. </p><p>“Our expectation is there’s going to be a nice long tail of backlist for the product. Likewise, we’re still selling <em>Lord of the Rings</em> product today,” Cocks said. “So even though we hit $200 million in December of ‘22 for<em> Lord of the Rings</em>, we sold a substantial percentage of that in the several years following and we expect <em>Final Fantasy</em> to be no different. It’s partially what’s powering our backlist, which already in, like, five and a half months in the year did more than we’ve ever done in any year prior.” Hasbro chief financial officer Gina Goetter added, “We’re continuing to produce this set. We think the set itself is going to have a huge long tail.” </p><p>While the rarest and most expensive cards in the set were only available in Collector Boosters, the initial print run of which is basically all sold out, regular cards in the set will continue to become available and hopefully drive down prices on some of the more sought-after standard cards. One of those is Vivi Ornitier, a mythic Legendary Creature from<em> Final Fantasy IX</em>. It’s a powerful card that synergizes well with lots of mana-hungry, spell-based decks and has been hovering around $45 for weeks now. Other examples include Knights of the Round and Bahamut summons. Unlike with standard <em>MTG</em> sets, fan interest in the cards for their own sakes, combined with their limited availability, is currently fueling <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/golden-chocobo-mtg-final-fantasy-price-foil-restock-1851784836&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/golden-chocobo-mtg-final-fantasy-price-foil-restock-1851784836">a particularly brutal reseller market for collectors</a></span>. </p><p>One upside is that those who just want to have fun playing with the cards can collect them much more cheaply in<em> Magic The Gathering Arena</em>, the video game adaptation for PC and mobile. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/baldurs-gate-4-d-d-mtg-arena-commander-g-i-joe-1851703869&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/baldurs-gate-4-d-d-mtg-arena-commander-g-i-joe-1851703869">It’s due for an update at some point in the future</a></span>, though Cocks also noted that the app only accounts for a small slice of the current fanbase. “Only 15-or-so percent of the player base plays on something like <em>Arena</em>,” he said. <br></p><p>.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://kotaku.com/final-fantasy-mtg-magic-gathering-vivi-stock-1851786817]]></content:encoded>

Monolith Soft’s flagship RPG series has consistently pushed the limits of Nintendo’s hardware, cramming massive and lush worlds into hardware that’s roughly a generation behind the home console competition. The results are typically impressive, if not a bit compromised. <em>Xenoblade Chronicles 2</em> in particular could suffer from some dips in image quality due to dynamic resolution scaling, and performance wouldn’t necessarily hold at 30 FPS either.</p><p>I’m not 100% sure these issues are <em>totally </em>smoothed over after watching <em>Xenoblade Chronicles 2</em> run on my Switch 2 with my naked eye, but they’re at least greatly minimized. Overall, the experience is just better on the new hardware. The resolution doesn’t appear to dip in the game’s usual trouble spots, and the frame rate didn’t take noticeable hits either. I do hope the <em>Xenoblade</em> series can get proper Switch 2 upgrades, as the game could clearly look way sharper if it wasn’t capped at such a low resolution (especially in handheld mode). That said, this series also contains over 500 hours of content if you intend to 100-percent each game, so I think it’s perfectly okay to get started on it now.</p><h2 id="h753971"><a id=""></a>4: <em>Super Mario RPG</em></h2><figure id="" data-id="dc84c8e9b71cb406f91abd0cdaa3cf44" data-recommend-id="image://dc84c8e9b71cb406f91abd0cdaa3cf44" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="720" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A screenshot of Super Mario RPG for the Nintendo Switch.

That said, the remake of the game <em>is</em>, and it didn’t always hold at a 60 FPS throughout its runtime on the original Switch. This is most noticeable in the game’s opening, but you can feel the occasional slowdown elsewhere too.</p><p>Fortunately, the Switch 2 smooths over these trouble spots effortlessly. Between the remaster of <em>Paper Mario: The Thousand-Year Door </em>and the all new <em>Mario &amp; Luigi: Brothership</em>, the past few years have been great for <em>Mario </em>RPG fans. That latter title benefits from the Switch 2 hardware too! If you’ve never tried these quirky adventures, you’re in for a treat whether you’re a casual gamer or a hardcore RPG nut.</p><h2 id="h753972"><a id=""></a>5: <em>Bayonetta 3</em></h2><figure id="" data-id="bdda8603fb00605e4e0d7511a7755052" data-recommend-id="image://bdda8603fb00605e4e0d7511a7755052" data-format="jpg" data-width="2550" data-height="1434" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A promotional screenshot of Bayonetta 3.

However, in a fast-paced action game like <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/bayonetta-3-review-ending-luka-jeanne-nintendo-switch-1849735230&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/bayonetta-3-review-ending-luka-jeanne-nintendo-switch-1849735230"><em>Bayonetta 3</em></a></span>, you’ll <em>really </em>feel the difference that extra frames can offer. On the original Switch, <em>Bayonetta 3 </em>generally targeted 60 FPS but usually didn’t hit it. Instead, the game would hover in the 50 FPS range and could drop <em>way </em>lower during certain attack animations. It’s not unplayable by any means, but obviously there’s room for improvement.</p><p>Which is <em>exactly </em>what <em>Bayonetta 3</em> on the Switch 2 serves up. Not only do you get those smooth 60-FPS graphics (where it’s possible in the game), but the Switch 2 even fixes some audio desync bugs that could pop up in the original sometimes. Load times are way faster too. If we weren’t limiting this list to Switch-exclusive games, <em>Bayonetta 3</em> would still be one of the most improved games on Nintendo’s next generation hardware.</p><p>As was the case with <em>Xenoblade Chronicles</em>, it would still be nice for <em>Bayonetta 3</em> to get a proper Switch 2 upgrade. If nothing else, the visuals would pop if the resolution was raised, especially in handheld mode. But even if that never comes to pass, there’s no denying that <em>Bayonetta 3</em> is better than it’s ever been before.</p><p>.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://kotaku.com/switch-2-games-run-better-upgrade-bayonetta-hyrule-xeno-1851786809]]></content:encoded>
