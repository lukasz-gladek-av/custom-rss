It includes 768 pieces and only costs $45. The only bad news is that it won’t arrive in time for the holiday. While orders start today, the set won’t begin shipping until March 1, 2025. </p><p>That might sound like a lot of pieces for such a compact set, but the devil is in the details. As explained leading up to Lego Horizon Adventures’ release, everything that appears in the game had to be made with actual Lego in the real world first. To make the robots as interactive and flexible as possible, they include lots of little parts and multiple joints that make them almost act like action figures. </p><p>“The Shell-Walker has posable legs and arms, opening claws and a detachable cargo pod and energy shield, while the fully articulated Sawtooth has opening jaws, a swivelling torso and a posable neck, head and legs,” <em>Horizon</em> franchise producer Tim Symons <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://blog.playstation.com/2024/11/18/celebrating-the-lego-horizon-adventures-launch-with-a-brand-new-lego-set/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://blog.playstation.com/2024/11/18/celebrating-the-lego-horizon-adventures-launch-with-a-brand-new-lego-set/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">wrote on the PlayStation Blog</a></span> on Monday. </p><p>It seems likely that Sony and Lego are planning multiple other <em>Horizon</em>-themed sets in the near-future. There are plenty of other big robots for them to adapt, including the massive Stormbird. It would also be neat to see the Carja city of Meridian adapted into Lego, though the company doesn’t seem to do as many building-oriented licensed sets these days. </p><p>In addition to <em>Lego Horizon Adventures</em> hitting PlayStation 5 and Switch this fall, the original <em>Horizon Zero Dawn </em>was recently remastered for PS5 while its sequel, <em>Forbidden West</em>, hit PC earlier this year. Sony seems to be all-in on the franchise, with a potential multiplayer spin-off <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/GamingLeaksAndRumours/comments/1gr7iu6/horizon_multiplayer_game_horizon_online_could/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GamingLeaksAndRumours/comments/1gr7iu6/horizon_multiplayer_game_horizon_online_could/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">rumored to arrive as early as 2025</a></span>. I’m sure a Lego sequel will be in the works, too, if the first one sells well enough. </p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
