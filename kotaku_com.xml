              <p>Mini PCs offer a third option from laptops and desktop PCs if you’re looking to run Windows without spending too much cash. They work brilliantly as dedicated work stations, supplemental devices to your other devices to get work done, or as your main device if you don’t want to take up too much space. They even make for handy little gaming units. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5581/">This GMKtec mini gaming PC happens to be on sale right now too. Amazon has the GMKtec K12 Gaming Mini PC discounted by 31% ahead of Black Friday.</a> For a limited time, you can grab this mini gaming PC for $220 off, bringing the price down from $720 to just $500.</p>
<p>As the name of the product category implies, a mini PC takes up substantially less room than a standard PC would. Heck, you can even reduce it’s footprint to zero by mounting it to the back of your display or monitor.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5581/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Designed for Gaming</h2>
<p>Taking a peak into the specs, The GMKtec mini PC is working with a Ryzen 7 H 255 processor. That has eight cores and 16 threads, an can run at up to 4.9 GHz. Paired with the powerful Radeon 780M iGPU, you can even get some decent gaming done with this hardware. The K12 mini PC is equipped with dual 16GB RAM, totaling to 32GB. It comes with a 512GB SSD but three SSD slots are available, each capable of reading up to 8TB for a max of 24TB. You get both Wi-Fi 6E support and Bluetooth 5.2 support built in.</p>
<p>The OCuLink port can take your gaming even further. You can actually plug into a beefier graphics card externally to get the gaming boost you’re looking for. Just know the mini PC doesn’t support hotswapping it. You’ll need to turn off the power first before plugging to or unplugging from a graphics card connection.</p>



<p>The base hardware is still pretty powerful, able to display in resolutions up to 8K if you need. It allows for connecting to up to four screens at once. The HDMI 2.1 will grant you up to 8K at 60Hz, the DisplayPort will grant you up to 4K at 60Hz, and the two USB-C can be used for display, though the product page doesn’t specs for those two.</p>
<p>Dual cooling fans help keep the rig from overheating. The two can deliver silent, ultra-efficient cooling at just 35dB. Plus the fans have cool lighting. Wouldn’t be a gaming PC without cool lighting.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/surprise-call-of-duty-black-ops-7%E2%80%B2s-campaign-is-multiplayer-only-and-doesn%E2%80%99t-let-you-pause.1353874/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>In a massive departure from the series norm, the campaign in the newly released <i>Call of Duty: Black Ops 7 </i>is an online co-op experience from start to finish. Not only is the campaign always online, but as if it thought it was <i>Elden Ring</i>, you can’t pause it, and you’ll get booted for idling.</p> <p>Maybe it’s secretly an experimental art project on the nature of entropy.</p> <p><i>Call of Duty: Black Ops 7</i> comes out today with a full campaign and multiplayer mode. The campaign, it seems, goes all in on co-op play. The <i>option </i>to play campaigns in co-op is usually a welcome one but here, co-op is so inherent to the experience that it’s making solo play really hard, with a lack of checkpoints and an expectation that you’re always online and never AFK (<a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-campaign-is-online-only-with-no-checkpoints-or-pausing-and-will-kick-you-if-youre-idle-for-too-long">h/t <i>IGN</i></a>).</p>

 <p>Apparently, trying to complete this campaign on your own ramps up the tedium, with you having to do things like repeat objectives scattered around an environment–such as placing explosives in certain spots–that were clearly designed to be handled by multiple players all working together.</p>

 <p>It’s an unfortunate situation for those who enjoy a straightforward, linear solo campaign with objectives that feel designed to accommodate solo play. Maybe go back and play 2022’s <i>Modern Warfare II</i>? It was kind of a snoozefest in some ways, but hey, at least you wouldn’t get kicked for idling.</p> <p>It kind of reminds me of that one time me and two friends of mine managed to somehow make it through a <i>Destiny </i>raid without the extra three players by running around like crazy people to accomplish certain objectives that were clearly made with more people in mind. It felt like we were getting away with something we shouldn’t’ve been. Maybe tackling <i>Black Ops 7</i>’s campaign solo at least offers some of these transgressive thrills?</p>

              <p>The announcement of a new&nbsp;<em>Minecraft</em> game would usually be something that came with a great deal of fanfare and publicity, which makes the strange, quiet appearance of&nbsp;<em>Minecraft Blast</em> quite peculiar. This mobile project, which is apparently a collab between <em>Minecraft</em> developers Mojang and&nbsp;<em>Candy Crush</em> creators King, has only come to anyone’s attention after it appeared on the Apple store for people in Malaysia. Huh.</p> <p>When Microsoft so controversially bought Activision in 2023, understandably most of our attention was on how this seemingly monopolistic move meant the Windows and Xbox owner now controlled everything from <em>Call of Duty</em> to <em>World of Warcraft</em>. But less focused on was the simultaneous acquisition of King, which Activision Blizzard had previously bought for $5.9 billion. That’s now suddenly being brought into the light with the sudden announcement of&nbsp;<em>Minecraft Blast</em>, a match-3 game in the manner of King’s mega-hit&nbsp;<em>Candy Crush Saga</em>, but based around the blocky world of&nbsp;<em>Minecraft</em>.</p>

 <p>Oh yes, because as hard as we might try to forget, Microsoft owns <em>Minecraft&nbsp;</em>too, after that 2014 purchase for $2.5 billion. And if I’m a besuited Microsoft exec, and I’m looking at the miniature model on my table of all the empires I own, at a certain point I’m definitely going to want to see if there’s money in combining them together.</p>

 <p>The result on this occasion is a free-to-play matching puzzle game set in <em>Minecraft</em>‘s world with <em>Minecraft</em>‘s art and tools. You have a sort of 3D mini-world in which you can craft, but to get the “energy” to do this you need to play the block-tapping 2D puzzle game. Here you tap matching groups of colored blocks to break those around them, revealing TNT and fireworks and so on as you attempt to clear a level. Although, not having played it myself and given the scant information <a href="https://www.minecraft.net/en-us/about-minecraft-blast">on the game’s site</a>, it’s hard to provide you with much clearer guidance.</p>

 <p>You might imagine a video of someone playing the game would be more informative, but&nbsp;<em>Minecraft</em> YouTuber PatarHD’s footage is so frustratingly edited and so painfully scripted that it feels like the world’s most confusing ad.</p>  <p><em>Minecraft Blast</em> is currently being playtested in Malaysia alone, and apparently this test will only last for a week or two. But Microsoft promises more locations and longer tests will be coming soon, stating that right now it is in “extremely early days with this project,” and that it plans “to start rolling out small, limited-run tests in select markets to help us gather early feedback and involve our community from the start.”</p>

 <p>However, in the YouTube video above, PatarHD claims that if you have an iOS device, you can just change your region to Malaysia and download the app now.</p> <p>It looks like the full version of&nbsp;<em>Minecraft Blast</em> is still a fair way off. Although given it’s F2P, perhaps we can enjoy the wait.</p>

                  Save 15% on the Funko Pop The Nightmare Before Christmas countdown calendar over at Amazon.
                </p><div>
              
              <p>I’ll tell you what a real nightmare before Christmas is. It’s shopping for all those gifts. Finding the right gift can be a struggle, and with lots of folks to shop for ranging across your friends, family, and loved ones, that bill can add up pretty quickly. That’s why it’s great to keep an eye out for a good deal during the holiday season. And right now, Amazon happens to have this Funko Pop advent calendar on sale featuring vinyl mini figures of beloved characters from Tim Burtons’s <em>The Nightmare Before Christmas</em>. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5580/">The mystery box filled with toys is normally priced at $50, but right now you can grab it for 19% off for a limited time. That brings the price down by nearly $10 so you only end up paying $40.</a></p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5580/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>



<h2>24 Days of Surprises</h2>
<p>Now, advent calendars make for a great Christmas gift* with a asterisk on it. The asterisk is to call out that by Christmas day, it’s already too late to give someone this gift. Unless there joy comes from just ripping open each door and having the instant gratification of all toys at once, which I guess more power to ya. But ideally, they should receive this before November 1 so they can enjoy beginning each day with a new treat in the form of Jack, Sally, or many of the other <em>The Nightmare Before Christmas </em>characters. Perhaps they can pair opening one of the doors with completing their daily Connections in The New York Times.</p>
<p>Okay so there’s another weird caveat I need to call attention to. At the time of writing this, all throughout the item page on Amazon, it calls out to, “Open the tiny doors to 13 unique collectable Funko Pocket Pops!” Now, there are 24 doors so I don’t know what’s going on. I’m not sure if that 13 is a typo (though it comes up twice on the page) or if more than half those little compartments are empty.</p>



<p>What I do know is the box in the images calls attention to it being a “24-piece holiday calendar.” Maybe they’re not all unique and there are some repeats in there or maybe someone on the Funko marketing team just copy/pasted this part of the description and forgot to edit it. There’s only one way to know for sure.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5580/">Buy yourself the Funko Pop <em>The Nightmare Before Christmas </em>countdown calendar for the reduced price of $40 and find out what’s inside for yourself.</a> Then come back to the comments here and let me know your findings.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/the-witcher-3s-most-important-player-choice-wasnt-always-part-of-the-game-2000644323</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/the-witcher-3%E2%80%98s-most-important-player-choice-wasn%E2%80%99t-always-part-of-the-game.1353805/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><em>The Witcher 3</em> lets you make a lot of choices as Geralt, the open-world RPG’s titular monster slayer, but its biggest strength is in how subtly they’re woven into the broader fabric of the world. None of the choices ever feel like they’re being telegraphed with big blinking signs. The long-term consequences are yours to parse. So it is with the game’s <a href="https://kotaku.com/the-witcher-3-geralt-yennefer-triss-kiera-romance-love-1849487104">big love triangle</a>, a branching path that CD Projekt Red recently revealed was a late edition to the best-seller.</p> <p>The sorceress Yennefer is who Geralt begins the game with, during a flashback at Kaer Morhen. The red-headed mage Triss Merigold doesn’t show up until halfway through when he gets to Novigrad, at which point players have the option of rekindling their past relationship or moving on as friends, depending in part on their choices during the prior game. Eventually, the player has to make their mutant playboy choose between the two, with their future partner eventually joining them at a cute little cottage at the end of both expansions.</p>

 <p>“It wasn’t [there] from the beginning, but at some point we understood that this lack of kind of conflict, personal conflict—of course, there’s Ciri—but there was a lack of <em>something</em>.” CD Projekt Red co-CEO Adam Badowski <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/rpg/the-witcher-3-didnt-originally-make-you-choose-between-romancing-yennefer-or-triss-this-decision-was-made-pretty-late/">told <em>PC Gamer</em></a>. “This decision was made pretty late, but it was great. It was a great decision.”</p>

 <p>While Yennefer is Geralt’s canonical love interest, she’s not actually in <a href="https://kotaku.com/first-witcher-game-remake-unreal-engine-5-1849816995">the first two games</a>. Triss, however, is, leading to a weird scenario&nbsp; in which many players actually have a stronger connection to her than to the witcher’s ongoing on-again, off-again partner. It would have been easy to steer him back to her for the duration of the third game, but playing up Geralt’s divided heart does a lot to give the otherwise gruff and sardonic mercenary a more emotionally engaging mini-arc within the final game.</p> <p>While Geralt will still make an appearance in <a href="https://kotaku.com/witcher-4-2027-release-window-investor-call-ps6-cdpr-1851772310"><em>The Witcher 4</em></a>, CDPR’s next sequel will pass the baton to Ciri as the main hero instead. Fortunately, fans of the grey wolf will get another chance to revisit the beginning of his journey in a <a href="https://kotaku.com/witcher-remake-open-world-rpg-cd-projekt-red-cyberpunk-1849832000">remake of <em>The Witcher 1</em></a> that is also in the works. Neither project has a release window just yet.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/apple-launches-major-black-friday-deal-on-ipads-selling-2025-wifi-model-at-new-all-time-low-2000644324</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/apple-launches-major-black-friday-deal-on-ipads-selling-2025-wifi-model-at-new-all-time-low.1353802/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>If you’ve been waiting for the right time to pick up an iPad, that time is now. Apple just kicked off most of its Black Friday deals on Amazon and spans everything from iPads and MacBooks to Apple Watches and AirTags. But perhaps the star of the show <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4533/">is the 11-inch iPad with the A16 chip (WiFi + 128GB) which is now down to $299 from its original $349 sticker price</a>. This <strong>model launched in early 2025</strong> and quickly became the best-selling tablet on the market so to see it drop to an all-time low this quickly almost feels too good to be true.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4533/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<p>Apple redesigned this iPad to handle the kind of multitasking most of us throw at our devices daily. The A16 chip powers through photo editing, gaming and streaming without hesitation. You get 128GB of storage right out of the gate and gives you plenty of room for apps, photos, videos, and documents before you even think about cloud storage.</p>



<h2>Best Value for Money Tablet</h2>
<p>It’s an <strong>11-inch Liquid Retina display</strong> that brings colors to life in such a way that streaming movies or editing photos becomes genuinely enjoyable. True Tone technology changes the color temperature of the screen with respect to your surroundings, so you are not squinting at a harsh blue glow by night or straining to see details by bright sunlight. This may sound minor until you realize how much easier it makes long reading sessions or late-night work sessions go on your eyes. The screen hits that sweet spot where it’s large enough for serious work but compact enough to toss in a bag without thinking twice.</p>
<p><strong>Wi-Fi 6 connectivity</strong> keeps you moving at full speed when you’re downloading files, uploading content, or jumping between video calls. The USB-C connector finally standardized charging and data transfer, meaning you can use the same cable for your iPad that you use for most of your other devices. There are 12MP cameras on both the front and back of the device, giving you solid options for video calls, document scanning, or just quick photos when you don’t have your phone handy. An important addition is Center Stage, a technology in the front camera that automatically pans and zooms to keep you in frame during video calls.</p>



<p>Touch ID built into the top button gives you quick access without typing passwords constantly. You unlock the iPad, sign into apps, and authorize Apple Pay transactions with just your fingerprint. The <strong>iPadOS uses hardware to full capacity</strong>, and allows you to run multiple apps side by side, use the Scribble to handwrite in any text field with an Apple Pencil, and organize your workflow in ways that actually make sense.</p>
<p>For $299, this iPad offers good value to anyone who needs a capable tablet that can handle real work without compromise.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/microsoft-joins-black-friday-with-the-2-in-1-surface-pro-2024-hundreds-off-its-lowest-price-ever.1353763/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Black Friday is just around the corner, and early deals are already coming in hot. This is a great time to grab both the essentials and big-ticket items you have been keeping an eye on, without paying the full price. Those looking for a powerful tablet that can turn into a full-fledged Windows laptop when needed should consider the Microsoft Surface Pro, especially now that it’s going for a lot less on Amazon.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5579/">The 2024 model of this machine typically retails for $2,100, but you can now snag it for $1,550 after a nice 26% discount.</a> This discount applies to the Platinum model and is available to both Prime and non-Prime members. It’s also one of the steepest price drops we have seen on this model, but we’re not expecting it to last long. It’s best to grab yours before the price shoots back up.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5579/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Massive Screen, Plus All-Day Battery Life</h2>
<p>It’s slightly bigger than most tablets out there. You’re getting a 13-inch OLED touchscreen display that delivers brilliant visuals with exceptional color accuracy in both bright and dim settings. Your favorite shows will come to life, and even gaming will feel immersive. Touchscreen makes it easy to navigate; you can swipe, scroll, pinch, sketch, and even type with ease.</p>
<p>The tablet also comes with a built-in stand at the back, which makes it easy to prop the screen up however you like. Working on the go? Stand it upright. Going through a long, boring document? Use it as a notebook. Feeling a bit creative? Lay it flat on the table to paint or sketch. You can also add the Surface Pro Flex keyboard (which is sold separately) to your setup and turn it into a laptop when needed.</p>



<p>Performance-wise, you’ve got a Snapdragon X Elite processor with 12 cores. It’s powerful enough to handle all your heavy-duty tasks like content creation, video production, multitasking, and more. The 32GB RAM makes sure you don’t experience any frustrating slowdowns as you work, while the massive 1TB SSD offers plenty of space to store all your photos, videos, and files with ease.</p>
<p>Copilot+ integration makes your everyday tasks a breeze. You can use it to ask questions, get help with studies, generate art using a simple prompt, and even enjoy better video calls with improved lighting and real-time subtitles. This 2-in-1 tablet also won’t give up on you in the middle of a busy day, as the battery life is designed to last up to 14 hours on a single charge.</p>

              <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-legends-za-review-switch-2-bugs-performance-2000637719"><i><span>Pokémon Legends: Z-A</span></i></a> <span>is so focused on its single-player story that you might have forgotten the RPG has a competitive mode like most other </span><i><span>Pokémon </span></i><span>games. This four-player versus mode pits you and the other trainers against one another in a race to see who can defeat the most monsters in a short amount of time. Even if you’re not a competitive person, you might still be playing this mode to try and </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-legends-z-a-mega-dimension-dlc-raichu-ranked-2000625708"><span>unlock some of the Mega Stones gated behind it</span></a><span>. So you want it to be fair, right? Well, it sounds like the mode is being overrun by hackers who are cheating their way to victory.</span></p>   <p><span>I don’t play much of </span><i><span>Legends: Z-A</span></i><span>’s multiplayer myself, so the first time I was clued into the hacking epidemic was through a video on TikTok that showed a </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-mega-evolutions-best-worst-designs-legends-z-a-2000625459"><span>Mega Garchomp</span></a><span> repeatedly using its powerful ground-type attack Earthquake without any cooldowns. Because there was no gap in between these devastating area-of-effect moves, its trainer racked up points on the scoreboard so quickly that there was no way anyone else could catch up.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><span>What I didn’t realize at the time was that this has become so widespread that </span><i><span>Pokémon </span></i><span>creators are weighing in and providing their own footage of rigged online matches. Some of the possible hacks might not be that recognizable to the untrained eye. AustinJohnPlays has an </span><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bAqhVep_5dc"><span>extensive video</span></a><span> on several hacked Pokémon he and others have encountered online, though not all of the exploits are as damning as a Garchomp with no cooldowns.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><span>For example, he shows a Lucario who seems to have been captured with a Poké Ball that isn’t available in </span><i><span>Legends: Z-A</span></i><span>. This doesn’t give anyone a competitive advantage but it’s an example of how some people are clearly modding the game in various ways. Some are advantageous in competitive play, like someone having an </span><a href="https://x.com/amiosi/status/1986910946556535092?s=20"><span>Alpha Xerneas</span></a><span>, a larger, more powerful form of a Legendary Pokémon that is only obtainable once in </span><i><span>Legends: Z-A </span></i><span>and not as an Alpha. Clearly, some players are up to hacked shenanigans and taking these unobtainable Pokémon online.</span></p>

  <p><span>Some of the hacks AustinJohnPlays highlights might seem harmless, such as some players changing their in-game trainer ID card images to real photos, but when you see there’s an astronomical gap between their online scores and those of regular players, it’s probably safe to assume they’re also messing with the stats, movesets, and properties of their Pokémon.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>At the moment, </span><i><span>Legends: Z-A </span></i><span>doesn’t have any kind of reporting or blocking feature, so these hackers are running around in competitive battles, spamming moves and using Pokémon they shouldn’t be able to access. We’ve reached out to The Pokémon Company for comment on the situation and will update this story if we hear back.</span></p>
