              <p>For decades, TV speakers have disappointed viewers with thin and muddy audio failing to live up to the visual quality of modern displays. Soundbars solve that problem by fitting proper speakers and amplification into a sleek package that fits beneath your TV without taking up space and adding the complexity of full surround sound systems.</p>
<p>The Bose smart Dolby Atmos soundbar brings premium audio technology from one of the most respected names in sound, <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5419/">and Amazon just dropped its price to an all-time low of $399 from the standard $499 tag</a>. It puts a Bose soundbar with top-notch features at the same price point as generic mid-range soundbars without the brand reputation or expert audio engineering that Bose brings.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5419/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Immersive Sound Technology</h2>
<p><strong>Dolby Atmos adds a third dimension of height channels</strong> to the traditional surround format, with the ability to place audio objects in space with pinpoint accuracy around and above you, rather than just from the left and right. It’s a spatial audio technology that makes movie soundtracks feel far more realistic, placing the sounds of helicopters passing overhead or rain falling from above in the correct places. To pull off this trick, the Bose soundbar features an acoustic architecture that somehow manages to shoehorn five separate transducers into its compact frame, including two upward-firing speakers that reflect sound off your ceiling to create the illusion of height channels.</p>
<p>TrueSpace technology denotes proprietary Bose processing that works beyond Dolby Atmos content. This intelligent system analyzes whatever audio signal you feed it, be it standard stereo music, older 5.1 surround soundtracks, or streaming content without spatial encoding. The <strong>processing upmixes those conventional formats to create a more enveloping and expansive sound</strong> <strong>experience</strong> from the soundbar’s multi-driver configuration.</p>



<p><em>A.I. Dialogue Mode</em> addresses one of the most common complaints about modern audio mixing: voices getting buried beneath music and effects. This artificial intelligence system continuously monitors the audio stream, and identifies dialogue frequencies and dynamically adjusting the balance to ensure voices remain clear and prominent without completely suppressing the atmospheric sounds that create immersion.</p>



<p>Voice control integration provides hands-free operation thanks to integrated Amazon Alexa functionality. Adjust the volume, change inputs, play music, or even fire up other smart home devices-all are possible with voice commands and no need to pick up a remote. Bose <em>Voice4Video</em> takes it a step further: it allows you to<strong> take control of your TV and either the cable or satellite box through the voice system</strong> of the soundbar, consolidating several devices into one unified voice control interface.</p>
<p>It features just about every major wireless streaming protocol, giving flexibility in the way you send audio to the system. Bluetooth connectivity works with any phone, tablet, or computer for easy wireless streaming. Apple AirPlay 2 offers higher-quality wireless audio for iPhone and Mac users while enabling multi-room audio with other AirPlay speakers. Spotify Connect lets you control playback directly from within the Spotify app with improved stability and quality compared to standard Bluetooth. Chromecast built-in supports casting from thousands of compatible apps on Android devices and computers.</p>
<p>Physical connectivity includes HDMI eARC for easy TV connection and support for all audio formats; optical input is available for older TVs, and USB is for service updates. The HDMI eARC connection carries both standard audio and advanced formats like Dolby Atmos through a single cable while allowing the soundbar to respond to your TV remote’s volume controls.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/the-mac-mini-m4-opens-black-friday-season-now-selling-at-new-record-low-on-amazon-2000628053</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/the-mac-mini-m4-opens-black-friday-season-now-selling-at-new-record-low-on-amazon.1353319/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Apple never discounts its products directly so third-party retailer deals are especially noteworthy for anyone looking to save on premium hardware. Amazon just kicked off Black Friday pricing for several Apple devices including AirTags, MacBook Air models, and the brand-new Mac Mini with M4 chip. The 2024 Mac Mini is Apple’s more affordable desktop computer, <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4124/">and the 256GB model is now available for $499 instead of its usual $599 price</a>. That’s a $100 discount and an all-time low for a machine that’s only been on the market for roughly a year now.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4124/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Desktop Power in a Small Package</h2>
<p>The<strong> M4 is among the latest generations of Apple silicon</strong> and brings impressive boosts in performance from what was a breathtakingly remarkable M2 that powered the last Mac Mini. The processor houses 10 CPU cores-again, a mix of performance and efficiency cores-allowing the system to handle tasks dynamically, depending on their computational demands.</p>
<p>The <strong>GPU here is an integrated 10-core GPU on the same chip as the CPU for all graphical processing</strong>. It does away with discrete graphics cards while still offering high-end visual performance. This unified architecture allows the GPU to share the same 16GB of unified memory as the CPU, meaning that in graphics-intensive applications, data access is way quicker than in systems where the GPU has separate video memory that constantly needs data transfers.</p>



<p>Speaking of memory, <strong>the 16GB of unified RAM is a significant upgrade from the base 8GB configuration Apple used</strong> in previous entry-level Macs. You can run many applications simultaneously without the slowdowns that occur when systems begin swapping data to storage. You can keep dozens of browser tabs open while working in productivity apps, editing photos, and listening to music without the frustrating lag that comes from too little RAM.</p>
<p>The <strong>256GB SSD will provide fast storage for your operating system</strong>, applications, and files. Solid-state drives allow for near-instant boot times and app launches compared to traditional hard drives, while Apple’s custom controllers push read and write speeds even further than standard SSDs. This capacity works well if you primarily use cloud storage services or external drives for large media libraries, though heavy users who store extensive local file collections might want to consider external storage solutions or the higher-capacity models.</p>



<p>The <strong>Gigabit Ethernet is built into the Mac Mini</strong> for wired network connectivity, thus offering more stable and faster internet in many situations than Wi-Fi. It proves very helpful when transferring huge files across your local network, streaming high-bitrate video content, or keeping reliable connections during video calls and remote work. Inclusion of Ethernet at the base price level means you don’t need to purchase adapters or sacrifice USB ports for network connectivity; wired connections eliminate the interference issues that sometimes plague wireless networks.</p>
<p><em>Apple Intelligence</em> offers advanced machine learning on the desktop and automates a range of tasks from intelligent writing assistance and image generation to enhanced Siri capabilities. Because these features are local on the M4 chip and run without using the cloud, execution is faster and more private, since your data never has to leave the device.</p>
<p>Its compact design <strong>measures 5 inches square and 2 inches tall</strong>, and occupies only a minimum of desk space but delivering full desktop performance. That small footprint makes the Mac Mini perfect for tight workspaces, minimal desk sets, or whenever you need powerful computing in a configuration without the bulk of a tower.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/red-dead-redemption-2-switch-ps5-sequel-2000642061"><em>Red Dead Redemption 2</em></a> was released back in 2018 on PS4 and Xbox One. <a href="https://kotaku.com/red-dead-redemption-2-the-kotaku-review-1829984369">It’s a very good open-world Wild West game</a> developed and published by Rockstar Games. And over six years later, this incredible video game, which got a PC port in 2019, has yet to receive a PS5/Series X update. Meanwhile, Rockstar recently confirmed that 2010’s <em>Red Dead Redemption</em> will, in fact, get a nice upgrade. Life is cruel like that sometimes.</p> <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/red-dead-redemption-remaster-ps5-xbox-series-switch-2-2000644016">On November 13, Rockstar Games announced that<em> Red Dead Redemption</em></a> would be ported to phones, PS5, Xbox Series X/S, and Switch 2. If you already own the PS4, Switch, or backwards-compatible digital Xbox 360 version of the game, you’ll get the upgrade for free when <em>RDR</em> makes the leap to new consoles <a href="https://www.rockstargames.com/newswire/article/258282o585k1ka/red-dead-redemption-coming-to-netflix-ios-android-ps5-xbox-series-and">on December 2.</a> This new version of<em> Red Dead Redemption</em> supports 4K/60, enhanced image quality, and HDR support on PS5/Xbox. Meanwhile, on Nintendo Switch 2, RDR supports DLSS, HDR, mouse controls, and 60FPS gameplay. And, like with 2023’s rerelease on PS4, this new version will include the zombie-infested <em>Undead Nightmare&nbsp;</em>DLC.&nbsp; Awesome stuff! But uh…hey, Rockstar, I think you forgot something.</p>

   <p>Since the launch of the PS5 and Xbox Series X/S in 2020, Rockstar fans have been begging the company to update or upgrade<em> Red Dead Redemption 2</em> so that the game can take full advantage of the more powerful machines. Over on PC, <em>RDR 2</em> looks amazing with its high framerates, increased draw distances, and impressive resolutions. That’s not to say <em>RDR 2</em> on PS4 is an ugly game, but it could be so much better. And yet, six years later…nothing. No update. No upgrade. Just rumors and whispers that maybe one day it might happen. But it never does.</p>

 <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/xbox-game-pass-leak-rdr-2-next-gen-red-dead-rockstar-1850852925">Even Xbox thought a modern update was coming</a>, according to leaked court documents from 2023. But alas, nope. Rockstar has seen fit to update and upgrade <em>Grand Theft Auto V</em> from PS3 to PS4 to PS5. And it’s now planning to upgrade <em>Red Dead Redemption</em> from last gen to current gen, for free, too. Sadly, <em>RDR 2</em>, for whatever reason, isn’t getting the same treatment, at least not yet.</p> <p>I’ll admit, I laughed when I saw the news that <em>Red Dead Redempti</em>on would get a fancy PS5 upgrade before <em>Red Dead Redemption 2.</em> It’s funny, in a depressing kind of way. Which, for a game as sad as<em> RDR 2</em>, feels like poetry. But I’m not here for amusing parallels between art and real life. I’m here to blast away bandits and lawmen in <em>RDR 2</em> in 4K/60 on PS5 Pro. I guess I’ll just buy a <a href="https://kotaku.com/16-cool-details-valve-new-steam-machine-console-controller-vr-headset-2000643572">Steam Machine next year and play <em>Red Dead Redemption 2</em> at 60FPS over there.</a> It’s probably the closest to a current-gen port we’ll get anytime soon, as <em>Grand Theft Auto 6</em> takes away most of Rockstar’s focus and resources.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/the-best-guns-for-every-possible-situation-in-arc-raiders.1353289/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><i>Arc Raiders</i> is the kind of game for which establishing strict metas is going to prove difficult. Your objective is to get out alive and with good loot; abstaining from violence is as valid a “strategy” as indulging in it. Is your death-machine build “better” than my stealthy saboteur who can easily outrun you and hide, getting away with all the stuff I collected, thereby “winning”? <i>Arc Raiders</i>’ gameplay has more going on, more varied “win conditions” than just who can kill who faster in a straight shootout.</p> <p>But some weapons do have genuine advantages over others. A strict showdown would reveal whose weapon and build options gave them the clear advantage. But we’re hardly running in perpetual circles shooting at each other all the time in <i>Arc Raiders</i>, nor are we all expected to kill one another until the last person declared standing is the winner. So one’s arsenal can serve many purposes, with a lot of room for stylistic preferences.</p>

 <p>The variety of weapons available in <i>Arc Raiders</i> lets you plan and build several different shooter archetypes, so let’s get into how these guns work.</p> <h2>What kinds of guns are in this game?</h2> <p><i>Arc Raiders</i> breaks its weapons down into eight broad categories: Assault Rifles, Battle Rifles, Submachine Guns, Shotguns, Pistols, Light Machineguns, Sniper Rifles, and “Special.”</p>

 <p>The guns in these categories also vary in terms of which of the five ammo types they use (Light, Medium, Heavy, Energy, and Launcher), as well as their firing mode, damage, firing rate, and range.</p> <p>Firing modes in particular are important as they determine the pace at which you can fire. Semi-auto fires with every pull of the trigger, full-auto constantly fires, and the three-round burst is rather self explanatory. Various other guns feature “actions,” meaning your character will have to operate the gun in some way after each shot (this is often distinct from reloading), so your shots will be slow, but usually quite powerful. Perhaps the most common example across a variety of different games is the bolt-action firing mode, which sees your character operating a bolt after each shot (simulating the operation of real-life bolt-action rifles).</p>

 <p>Why is all of this important? Well, if you want to run and gun, something like a Ferro, which is a heavy break-action rifle and requires you to load each round, won’t be as suitable as something like a Stitcher, which is a fully automatic submachine gun. But that Stitcher won’t help you nail a high-powered shot from a great distance; that’s the Ferro’s speciality.</p>

 <p>For each of these broad gun types, there are different rarities too, with rarer items being more powerful: gray is for common guns, green for uncommon, blue for rare, purple for epic, yellow for legendary.</p> <p>And with the exception of legendary guns, all guns can be leveled up three times to a max of level four. Various elements of a firearm improve as you level them up. Some will see increased magazine size and increased durability, others will see increased durability and fire-rate, and so on. I’m finding <a href="https://arcraiders.wiki/wiki/Weapons">this <i>Arc Raiders</i> wiki</a> to be an excellent resource for the raw numbers.</p>

 <p>So let’s sort these guns into some use cases, of which you’ll find there’s some overlap.</p> <h2>The best guns for close-quarters combat</h2> <figure id="attachment_2000641794" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000641794"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000641794">© Screenshot: Embark Studios / Claire Jackson / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p>Shotguns on average promise wild amounts of high damage with exceedingly poor range. Great for times when you’re nervous someone might jump out from a corner mere feet away from you. For those, you get two options:</p>

 <ul> <li aria-level="1"><b>Il Toro:</b> Uncommon shotgun, pump-action (pretty awesome when leveled up and kitted out well)</li> <li aria-level="1"><b>Vulcano: </b>Epic shotgun, semi-automatic (the one time I had a chance to use this, I gut jumped and barely fired a shot off before it was long gone)</li> </ul> <p>Following that, submachine guns will fare well given their high firing rate comes at the cost of range, but you also don’t need to worry about having pinpoint accuracy.</p> <ul> <li aria-level="1"><b>Stitcher: </b>Common submachine gun, fully automatic (pretty awesome when fully leveled up and kitted out with good mods)</li> <li aria-level="1"><b>Bobcat: </b>Epic submachine gun, fully automatic</li> </ul> <p>Finally, assault rifles aren’t terrible in some cases, provided they’re fully automatic (for my playstyle, anyway—if you can accurately place semi-automatic shots while experiencing the panic of a close-quarters gun fight, more power to you). Fully automatic assault rifles include:</p> <ul> <li aria-level="1"><b>Rattler: </b>Common assault rifle (frustrating to use at low levels, in my opinion)</li> <li aria-level="1"><b>Tempest:</b> Epic assault rifle</li> <li aria-level="1"><b>Bettina:</b> Epic assault rifle</li> </ul> <h2>The best guns for medium-range combat</h2> <figure id="attachment_2000644148" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000644148"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000644148">© Screenshot: Embark Studios / Claire Jackson / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p>These are the situations in which your enemy isn’t so far off you need a scope to see ‘em, but they’re still far enough away to render something like a shotgun pretty pointless. <b>If you can control the recoil well and shoot in controlled bursts, the Rattler, Tempest, and Bettina are good options here too</b>. Otherwise, the following semi-automatic weapons and the lone three-round burst rifle will serve you well:</p>

 <ul> <li aria-level="1"><b>Kettle:</b> Common assault rifle, semi-automatic (I do not get along with this weapon, FWIW)</li> <li aria-level="1"><b>Arpeggio:</b> Common assault rifle, three-round burst (it’s like the FAMAS from <i>Metal Gear Solid</i> and the battle rifle from <i>Halo 2</i> had a baby)</li> </ul> <h2>The best guns for long-range combat</h2> <figure id="attachment_2000644149" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000644149"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000644149">© Screenshot: Embark Studios / Claire Jackson / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p>While the assault rifles above can certainly prove useful in some limited long-range situations, you have far better options for delivering high-damage, precision shots from a distance if your marksmanship is up to snuff.</p> <ul> <li><b>Ferro:</b> Common battle rifle, break-action (using this is the best part of losing all the way to subsisting on Common guns)</li> <li><b>Renegade:</b> Rare battle rifle, lever-action (like a faster though slightly weaker Ferro)</li> <li aria-level="1"><b>Osprey: </b>Rare sniper rifle, bolt-action (for when you want to <a href="https://youtu.be/dAXsSFlu6Ug">be her</a>)</li> <li aria-level="1"><b>Jupiter:</b> Legendary sniper rifle, bolt-action</li> </ul> <p>Note that the only gun with a scope at all in this game is the Osprey sniper rifle. Even the legendary Jupiter sniper rifle just has the screen zoom in a bit when ADS-ing instead of shifting to a scoped view.</p> <h2>What about those pistols?</h2> <figure id="attachment_2000644150" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000644150"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000644150">© Screenshot: Embark Studios / Claire Jackson / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p>Pistols and handguns are funny things in many shooters. On one hand, they are perhaps most functional as sidearms–perfect for those “oh, shit” moments when you don’t have enough time to reload your main weapon, and so fall back to something a little speedier though less powerful. On the other, they’re often too cool to just be guns you fall back on.</p>

 <p>If you’re after the theater of being <i>that</i> person with the quick trigger finger on a pistol, start with the Burletta for training wheels and graduate to the Venator.</p> <p>These are your four pistol options:&nbsp;<b></b></p> <ul> <li aria-level="1"><b>Hairpin:</b> Common, slide-action (permanently silenced)</li> <li aria-level="1"><b>Burletta: </b>Uncommon, semi-automatic (definitely the most side-armed of sidearms)</li> <li aria-level="1"><b>Anvil: </b>Uncommon, single-action (<i>Arc Raiders</i>’ hand cannon)</li> <li aria-level="1"><b>Venator</b>: Rare, semi-automatic</li> </ul> <h2>And the toys</h2> <p>Everything above will cover your bases. But if you want to pack a ton of heat to take down the game’s biggest threats or show other players you’re not messing around, here are your options:&nbsp;<b></b></p> <ul> <li aria-level="1"><b>Torrente: </b>Rare light machine gun, fully automatic (the bullets literally go <i>brrrrrrr</i>)</li> <li aria-level="1"><b>Equalizer:</b> Legendary beam rifle, fully automatic</li> <li aria-level="1"><b>Hullcracker:</b> Epic armaments launcher, pump-action</li> </ul> <hr> <p>And there ya have it, roughly five different broad shooter archetypes spread out amongst <i>Arc Raiders</i>’ existing arsenal. Naturally, the higher tier of rarity, the better the gun is at the thing it does. Though you still might find, for example, that while the Ferro and Renegade occupy very similar territory, they have some clear differences that might still make the Ferro more appealing for some (namely the higher damage per shot).</p> <p>Also, all of these guns at level four are the best versions of themselves. As for modifications, muzzle attachments, rear stock options, and so forth, those are a subject for another day since they can help guide any one of these guns down a more specialized path.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Crystal Dynamics is undergoing another round of cuts. It revealed on Thursday that nearly 30 more developers would be laid off as the company restructures for the future. Specifically, it claimed the cuts were necessary to “optimize the continued development of our flagship <em>Tomb Raider</em> game.” The <a href="https://kotaku.com/tomb-raider-lara-croft-crystal-dynamics-amazon-games-1849898949">Amazon Games-backed project</a> was announced three years ago and still no official details have been shared, though <em>Kotaku</em> understands its development has been challenging as Crystal Dynamics tried to push the franchise in the direction of an open-world experience.</p> <p>The studio announced the layoffs <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/crystal-dynamics/posts/?feedView=all">on LinkedIn</a>:</p> <blockquote><p>Today we’ve made the difficult but necessary decision to reorganize Crystal Dynamics’ studios and teams. As a result, we’ve parted ways with just under 30 team members across various departments and projects as we restructure the company and business for our next generation. Crystal deeply thanks all of those impacted for their incredible talent, hard work, and dedication, which helped shape the studio in so many ways. We are committed to offering our fullest resources and support to you during this transition.</p> <p>To our players – as the realities of the industry continue to evolve, we’ve made these painful choices as a way to optimize the continued development of our flagship Tomb Raider game, as well as shaping the rest of the studio to make new games for the future.</p> <p>We appreciate the continued support of our players, our colleagues, and our partners during this transition and look forward to sharing the team’s amazing new work with the world in the future.</p></blockquote> <p>It’s the third round of layoffs this year and comes only months after cuts that were made due to the Microsoft’s cancellation of <em>Perfect Dark</em>, which Crystal Dynamics was doing the bulk of development on. The Xbox stealth action game <a href="https://kotaku.com/perfect-dark-canceled-take-two-embracer-xbox-crystal-dynamics-2000622400">was reportedly</a> almost revived under a new publisher, but the deal felt apart over IP rights.</p> <p>The studio has been part of <a href="https://kotaku.com/mbracer-lord-rings-tomb-raider-1851425713">Embracer Group</a> since it was sold by Square Enix as part of a $300 million package back in 2022. Its publishing partner for <em>Tomb Raider</em>, Amazon Games, recently underwent <a href="https://kotaku.com/amazon-layoffs-lord-rings-mmo-tomb-raider-2000639620">its own mass layoffs</a> and announced it was taking a step back from certain internally developed AAA games. Crystal Dynamics’ latest budgetary pressures could possible be the result of Amazon pulling back on the deal.</p>
