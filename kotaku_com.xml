I had one for the original <em>Oblivion </em>run back in my school days. Back then, I knew where to find every side quest in the game. There were over 250. Still are, but now they’re enhanced, beautified for the modern gamer. One side quest retains its crown as the best, despite the game’s age. “A Brush With Death” is <em>Oblivion Remastered</em>’s best side quest by far, and here’s how to find and beat it!</p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="195579" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="This Narrative Adventure About Doomed Teenage Dinosaurs Feels Too Real" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="178" data-playlist="195579,196411,195891" data-current="195579"><div><p>This Narrative Adventure About Doomed Teenage Dinosaurs Feels Too Real</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195579/195579_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195579/195579_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195579/195579_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195579/195579_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/21074.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><h2 id="h735306"><a id="1"></a>Where to find ‘A Brush With Death’</h2><figure id="" data-id="c368227e3247365403833ab23f7a30a1" data-recommend-id="image://c368227e3247365403833ab23f7a30a1" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The magical painting portal in A Brush With Death in Oblivion Remastered." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="The magical painting portal in A Brush With Death in Oblivion Remastered." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Photo<!-- -->: <!-- -->Bethesda / Brandon Morgan / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="c368227e3247365403833ab23f7a30a1" data-recommend-id="image://c368227e3247365403833ab23f7a30a1" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The magical painting portal in A Brush With Death in Oblivion Remastered." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Like most good side quests in the game, you’ll first encounter “A Brush With Death” by speaking with the many beggars and citizens in Cheydinhal. Eventually, someone will tell you about a local painter, Rythe Lythandas, who suddenly disappeared.</p><p>It’s time to investigate! You can find Tivela Lythandas, Rythe’s wife, at their home in the residential district of the city. She’ll explain that the man locked himself in his painting studio and hasn’t come out, he’s just gone. You’ll receive Rythe’s Studio Key from her, and delving into the darkest depths of a painter’s mind will lead you to a mysterious painting that you can enter.</p><h2 id="h735307"><a id="2"></a>How to complete ‘A Brush With Death’</h2><figure id="" data-id="51152c688c75afd181759fa8a95d9e87" data-recommend-id="image://51152c688c75afd181759fa8a95d9e87" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The famous painter, Rythe Lythandas, in A Brush With Death in Oblivion Remastered." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="The famous painter, Rythe Lythandas, in A Brush With Death in Oblivion Remastered." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Bethesda / Brandon Morgan / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="51152c688c75afd181759fa8a95d9e87" data-recommend-id="image://51152c688c75afd181759fa8a95d9e87" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The famous painter, Rythe Lythandas, in A Brush With Death in Oblivion Remastered." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>As it turns out, the painting is a magic portal leading you into an artistic world in which everything—from Rythe to the trees surrounding you—is a masterful brush stroke. Unfortunately, a thief stole Rythe’s magic paintbrush, preventing him from returning to the physical world. That’s your primary goal: Retrieve the Brush of Truepaint. Then, you and Rythe can escape. Thanks to the innate sense of direction most gamers have, you should have no trouble following the clear path deeper into the forest.</p><p>But first, trolls! </p><p>The thief didn’t make it far, all thanks to a small horde of Painted Trolls. You can deal with them pretty easily by exhausting all dialogue with Rythe. He’ll provide you with six Turpentines, which buff you significantly. Each one allows you to deal +100 damage to Painted Trolls once applied to your physical weapon. They’re tough S-O-Bs, of course, so prepare for a fight either way.</p><figure id="" data-id="50ec7da35b49bb5ecbe56ebb56a3e01b" data-recommend-id="image://50ec7da35b49bb5ecbe56ebb56a3e01b" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A sword is covered in blood in a painted world." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A sword is covered in blood in a painted world." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Bethesda / Brandon Morgan / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="50ec7da35b49bb5ecbe56ebb56a3e01b" data-recommend-id="image://50ec7da35b49bb5ecbe56ebb56a3e01b" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A sword is covered in blood in a painted world." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Once you clear the mob, continue forward through the painting world until you find the Bosmer Thief.

He’s not carrying anything else useful.</p><h2 id="h735308"><a id="3"></a>Quest rewards</h2><figure id="" data-id="7cc46f5afcc3645040dc5d326f497edb" data-recommend-id="image://7cc46f5afcc3645040dc5d326f497edb" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The unique item, Apron of Adroitness, offered a quest reward for A Brush With Death in Oblivion Remastered." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="The unique item, Apron of Adroitness, offered a quest reward for A Brush With Death in Oblivion Remastered." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Bethesda / Brandon Morgan / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="7cc46f5afcc3645040dc5d326f497edb" data-recommend-id="image://7cc46f5afcc3645040dc5d326f497edb" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The unique item, Apron of Adroitness, offered a quest reward for A Brush With Death in Oblivion Remastered." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Upon exiting the portal, Rythe will reward you with a single item, the <strong>Apron of Adroitness</strong>, which offers Fortify Agility and Intelligence +6. You can sell it for over one thousand gold, if you’d rather have a bit of money, though. Oh, and you’ll also receive +1 Fame, but who actually cares about that?</p><hr><p><br><em>Oblivion Remastered</em> is available now on PS5, Xbox Series X/S, Windows PCs, and Game Pass.  </p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

It doesn’t include 300 media apps nobody uses. It won’t ever support some silly AI co-pilot that can “help” you play <em>Overwatch 2.</em> It doesn’t include NFTs or blockchain tools. </p><p>Instead, the Switch 2 is just a better version of a video game console you already liked, but now it runs faster, looks better, and boasts a few smart improvements. Its store, while still filled with slop, is faster and snappier than ever. GameChat is great! Nintendo seems to have realized that people love Discord and has built a simple-to-use version of that into the Switch 2 OS that kids and non-techy people can use easily. But beyond that, the Switch 2 is just a better Switch. </p><p> Boy, that’s nice, huh? My phone gets more and more annoying with each update, and looking to upgrade to a new phone is a minefield of AI-powered devices with IMAX-capable cameras attached to them. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.cnet.com/tech/mobile/cnet-survey-just-11-of-people-upgrade-their-phone-for-ai-features-heres-what-they-want-instead/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.cnet.com/tech/mobile/cnet-survey-just-11-of-people-upgrade-their-phone-for-ai-features-heres-what-they-want-instead/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">It all sucks so much and nobody wants this shit! </a></span></p><p> The fact that the Switch 2 is just simply nice to use and better than what came before it shouldn’t be something to celebrate. Yet, in 2025, I’m over the moon about Nintendo’s new console simply because it hasn’t been ruined in the pursuit of profits. It hasn’t been “improved” in the hopes of making the number go up. Business idiots didn’t cram it full of garbage nobody wants. That’s really nice. </p><p>When the Switch 2 was revealed, some complained that it was too safe. That the Switch 2 wasn’t innovative enough. And maybe that’s true, but I don’t really care because the Switch 2 is the rare tech product that doesn’t annoy me. $450 is a fair price to pay for an upgraded product that is actually better, faster, and not annoying to use. I’ll gladly pay that in 2025. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/mario-kart-world-switch-2-price-80-nintendo-direct-1851774262&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/mario-kart-world-switch-2-price-80-nintendo-direct-1851774262">Though $80 for a game is still wild, come on, Nintendo</a></span>. </p><p> .<br></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Here’s a handy breakdown:</p><ul data-type="List" data-style="Bullet"><li><strong>Phase 1 (Exposure):</strong> Presented as a tiny purple gauge among the other status icons above your health bar. It slowly fills up on its own, although taking more Frenzy attacks will accelerate the progress. Eating a Nulberry can lower the gauge, but the only way to cure it is to land multiple hits on a monster.</li><li><strong>Phase 2 (Infected):</strong> Presented as a swirling red cloud among your status icons. Failing to stop the exposure gauge from filling up results in a temporary halt to your natural health recovery and an increase in damage taken.</li><li><strong>Phase 2 (Cured):</strong> Presented as a swirling blue cloud among your status icons. Landing enough attacks will cure you of the Frenzy Virus and provide a temporary increase to your Affinity.</li></ul><p><strong>Antivirus is a fantastic skill to bring to this fight</strong>. It makes curing the virus a lot easier and provides an increased Affinity bonus for doing so. The one catch is that aside from the Sane Jewel decoration and Sanity Charm talismans, this skill is only available with some of the Gore Magala forged armor pieces. Said armor also has a Set Bonus Skill to self-inflict the Frenzy Virus while fighting any monster, so more confident hunters can use it to their advantage. I’d suggest avoiding the virus altogether if you have trouble dealing with it.</p><h2 id="h415907"><a id="3"></a>Gore Magala’s weaknesses</h2><figure id="" data-id="aac87e2aa9d3f09c3d22c7dc5cf287bb" data-recommend-id="image://aac87e2aa9d3f09c3d22c7dc5cf287bb" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The Suggested Strategy tab for Gore Magala, showing its break points and weaknesses." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="The Suggested Strategy tab for Gore Magala, showing its break points and weaknesses." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Capcom / Samuel Moreno / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="aac87e2aa9d3f09c3d22c7dc5cf287bb" data-recommend-id="image://aac87e2aa9d3f09c3d22c7dc5cf287bb" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The Suggested Strategy tab for Gore Magala, showing its break points and weaknesses." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>There is a lot to keep track of when hunting Gore Magala, and that’s made much harder when it dictates the pacing of the hunt. Utilize the following weaknesses against it to slow the fight down and provide the openings you need:</p><ul data-type="List" data-style="Bullet"><li><strong>Elemental Weaknesses:</strong> Fire</li><li><strong>Weapon Type Weaknesses:</strong> Cut, Blunt</li><li><strong>Breakable Parts:</strong> Antenna, Tail (can also be severed), Wings x2</li><li><strong>Susceptible Status Ailments:</strong> Blastblight (most effective), Exhaust (most effective), Paralysis, Poison, Sleep, Stun</li><li><strong>Items and Traps:</strong> Shock Trap, Pitfall Trap</li></ul><h2 id="h415908"><a id="4"></a>How to beat Gore Magala</h2><p>It’s time to put everything into practice. <strong>Gore Magala’s biggest blind spot is right underneath it.</strong> The big monster will likely need to reposition or use an attack with a sizable wind-up to reach you. This is the best place to be without worrying about any long combos locking you into a dangerous situation.</p><p>The camera, of course, will present an issue. <em>Monster Hunter Wilds</em> will prioritize visibility for your character, so the giant Gore Magala might turn invisible when you’re under it. Do your best not to lose track of your target. Trust me that you do not want to randomly get hit by an air dive or any Frenzy-related attack.</p><p>Speaking of, <strong>you may notice the wings begin to glow purple throughout the hunt. This is a sign that Gore Magala is about to enter the unique Frenzy State</strong>. You’ll know this state is fully active once two horn-like antennas emerge from its head. Expect a lot more movement and much more aggressive attacks when this happens. Dealing enough damage to the head is the best way to end this state, but you might need to use some traps to keep it in place. Saving your opportunity to <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/monster-hunter-wilds-how-to-mount-master-mounter-1851775446&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/monster-hunter-wilds-how-to-mount-master-mounter-1851775446">mount</a></span> will also come in handy at this moment.</p><p>I’d be remiss not to highlight the importance of your environment. Both the Ice Shard Cliffs and Ruins of Wyveria have narrow areas that can make this an even bigger pain. Lure the monster to larger areas, or better yet, towards other monsters. Let them fight while you recover and sharpen your weapons. Don’t forget about triggering falling debris whenever possible as well. Any knockdown is a welcome knockdown. </p><p>There honestly isn’t much more to this hunt. Gore Magala simply hits hard and then hits a lot harder while in the Frenzy State and when you’re infected with the Frenzy Virus. Always prioritize not getting infected and ending the Frenzy State as soon as possible. If you’re struggling and not aiming for a particular carving reward, remember that you can always capture the monster once it’s weak enough. That’s a lot easier than finishing the hunt by slaying it.</p><p>Everything above will also apply to its tempered version, but you should expect a much more difficult fight. Tempered Gore Magala is relentless in its attacks and will enter the Frenzy State a lot faster. Seeing huge chunks of your health disappear is a common occurrence. Be prepared with high defense and preferably a level-three Antivirus skill. If you typically use a weapon that can guard, consider switching out to something different. I’ve found dodging is overall more helpful than guarding due to the high amount of chip damage you can take.</p><h2 id="h415909"><a id="5"></a>Gore Magala’s drops</h2><figure id="" data-id="8e48d22ae56637656098192d5a78cc13" data-recommend-id="image://8e48d22ae56637656098192d5a78cc13" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The Large Monster Field Guide screen, showing Gore Magala’s different material drops." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="The Large Monster Field Guide screen, showing Gore Magala’s different material drops." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Capcom / Samuel Moreno / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="8e48d22ae56637656098192d5a78cc13" data-recommend-id="image://8e48d22ae56637656098192d5a78cc13" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The Large Monster Field Guide screen, showing Gore Magala’s different material drops." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>After victory comes the hard-earned spoils.

Perhaps BioWare learned a hard lesson by leaving <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/dragon-age-inquisition-the-kotaku-review-1659833205&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/dragon-age-inquisition-the-kotaku-review-1659833205"><em>Dragon Age: Inquisition</em></a></span> on a cliffhanger and didn’t want to repeat the same restriction. But <em>The Veilguard </em>doesn’t just wrap up its own story; it concludes several major threads dating back to <em>Origins</em>, which feels calculated and deliberate. If BioWare’s goal with <em>The Veilguard </em>was to bring almost everything to a definitive end, the thematic note on which it leaves this world acts as a closing graf concluding the series’ overarching thesis.</p><p>Ignoring the bigotry that has followed <em>The Veilguard </em>like a starving rat digging through trash, one of the most common criticisms I heard directed toward the game was that it lacked a certain thorny disposition that was prevalent in the first three games. Everyone in the titular party generally seems to like each other, there aren’t real ethical and philosophical conflicts between the group, and the spats that do arise are more akin to the arguments you probably get into with your best friends. It’s a new dynamic for the series. The Veilguard doesn’t feel like coworkers as the Inquisition did, nor the disparate group who barely tolerated each other that we followed in <em>Dragon Age II</em>. They’re friends who, despite coming from different backgrounds, factions, and places, are pretty much on the same page about what the world should be. They’re united by a common goal, sure, but at the core of each of their lived experiences is a desire for the world to be better. </p><figure id="" data-id="9b92f5d41be4bf64692c264c062b5702" data-recommend-id="image://9b92f5d41be4bf64692c264c062b5702" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Rook and Morrigan talk outside the Lighthouse." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Rook and Morrigan talk outside the Lighthouse." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->BioWare / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="9b92f5d41be4bf64692c264c062b5702" data-recommend-id="image://9b92f5d41be4bf64692c264c062b5702" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Rook and Morrigan talk outside the Lighthouse." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>This rose-colored view of leftism doesn’t work for everyone. At its worst, <em>The Veilguard </em>can be so saccharine it’d cause a cavity, which is far from what people have come to expect from a series in which the mage-hating elf Fenris and pro-mage radical Anders didn’t care if the other lived or died. It also bleeds into a perceived softening of the universe. Factions like the Antivan Crows have essentially become the Bat Family from DC Comics, with no mention of the whole child slavery thing that was our first introduction to them back in <em>Origins</em>. The Lords of Fortune, a new pirate faction, go to great lengths to make sure you know that they’re not like the other pirates who steal from other cultures, among other things. I joked to a friend once that <em>The Veilguard </em>is a game terrified of getting canceled, and as such, a lot of the grit and grime has been washed off for something shiny and polished. </p><p>That is the more critical lens through which to view the way <em>The Veilguard</em>’s sanitation of Thedas. To an extent, I agree. We learned so much about how the enigmatic country of the Tevinter Imperium was a place built upon slavery and blood sacrifice, only for us to conveniently hang out in the common poverty-stricken areas that are affected by the corrupt politics we only hear about in sidequests and codex entries. But decisions like setting <em>The Veilguard</em>’s Tevinter stories in the slums of Dogtown give the game and its writers a place to make a more definitive statement, rather than existing in the often frustrating centrism <em>Dragon Age</em> loved to tout for three games.</p><p>I have a lot of pain points I can shout out in the <em>Dragon Age </em>series, but I don’t think anything has stuck in my craw more than the way the end of Anders’ antagonistic “Rivalry” relationship goes down in <em>Dragon Age II </em>if you don’t support his crusade to emancipate the mages from their captivity in the Circle of Magi. This is a tortured radical mage who is willing to give his life to fight for the freedom of those who have been born into a corrupt system led by the policing Templars. And yet, if you’ve followed his rivalry path, Anders will turn against the mages he, not five minutes ago, did some light terrorism trying to free. In <em>Inquisition</em>, this conflict of ideals and traditions comes to a head, but you’re able to essentially sweep it all under the rug as you absorb one faction or the other into your forces. So often, <em>Dragon Age </em>treats its conflicts and worldviews as toys for the player to slam against one another, shaping the world as they see fit, and bending even the most fiercely devoted radical to their whims. And yes, there are some notable exceptions to this rule, but when it came to world-shifting moments of change, <em>Dragon Age</em> always seemed scared to assert that the player might be wrong. Mages and Templars, oppressed and oppressors, were the same in the eyes of the game, each worthy of the same level of scrutiny.</p><figure id="" data-id="e314b3b75c433b93d25bb1f7f304b910" data-recommend-id="image://e314b3b75c433b93d25bb1f7f304b910" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Neve and Rook eat fish together." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Neve and Rook eat fish together." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->BioWare / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="e314b3b75c433b93d25bb1f7f304b910" data-recommend-id="image://e314b3b75c433b93d25bb1f7f304b910" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Neve and Rook eat fish together." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Before <em>The Veilguard</em>, I often felt <em>Dragon Age </em>didn’t actually believe in anything. Its characters did, but as a text, <em>Dragon Age </em>often felt so preoccupied with empowering the player’s decisions that it felt like Thedas would never actually get better, no matter how much you fought for it. While it may lack the same prickly dynamics and the grey morality that became synonymous with the series, <em>The Veilguard</em> doesn’t just believe that the world is full of greys and let you pick which shade you’re more comfortable with. Of the entire series, it’s the most whole-hearted, full-throated declaration that the world of Thedas can be better than it was before.</p><p>Essentially retconning the Antivan Crows to a family of superheroes is taking a hammer to the problem, whereas characters like Neve Gallus, a mage private eye with a duty-bound love for her city and its people, are the scalpel with which BioWare carves its vision of how the world of Thedas can change. Taash explores their identity through the lens of <em>Dragon Age</em>’s longstanding Qunari culture, known for its rigidness in the face of an ever-changing world, and comes out the other end a new person, defined entirely by their own views and defying others. Harding discovers the truth behind how the dwarves were severed from magic, and still remembers that she believes in the good in people. The heroes of <em>The Veilguard </em>have seen the corruption win out, and yet never stop believing that something greater is possible. It’s not even an option in <em>The Veilguard</em>’s eyes. The downtrodden <em>will</em> be protected, the oppressed <em>will</em> live proudly, and those who have been wronged <em>will</em> find new life.</p><p>That belief is what makes <em>The Veilguard </em>a frustrating RPG, to some. It’s so unyielding in its belief that Thedas and everyone who inhabits it can be better that it doesn’t entertain your choices complicating the narrative. Depending on how you play, Rook can come from plenty of different backgrounds, make decisions that will affect thousands of people, but they can never really be an evil bastard. If they did, it would fundamentally undermine one of the game’s most pivotal moments. In the eleventh hour, <em>Dragon Age </em>mainstay Varric Tethras is revealed to have died in the opening hour, and essentially leaves all his hopes and dreams on the shoulders of Rook. After our hero is banished to the Fade and forced to confront their regrets in a mission gone south, Varric’s spirit sends Rook on their way to save the day one last time. He does so with a hearty chuckle, saying he doesn’t need to wish you good luck because “you already have everything you need.” He is, of course, referring to the friends you have calling to you from beyond the Fade. </p><figure id="" data-id="2b1e01cdd4e73e06282d8db3597b5274" data-recommend-id="image://2b1e01cdd4e73e06282d8db3597b5274" data-format="jpg" data-width="2048" data-height="1152" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Rook and Varric walk up stairs." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Rook and Varric walk up stairs." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->BioWare / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="2b1e01cdd4e73e06282d8db3597b5274" data-recommend-id="image://2b1e01cdd4e73e06282d8db3597b5274" data-format="jpg" data-width="2048" data-height="1152" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Rook and Varric walk up stairs." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Varric, the narrator of <em>Dragon Age,</em> uses his final word to declare a belief that things will be okay. This isn’t because Rook is the chosen one, destined to save the world, but because they have found people who are unified by one thing: a need to fight for a better world. That declaration concluding what’s possibly <em>Dragon Age</em>’s final<em> </em>game is what makes it compelling. Reaching the end of a universe’s arc and being wholly uninterested in leaving it desecrated by hubris or prejudice is a bold claim on BioWare’s part. It takes some authorship away from the player, but in return, it leaves the world of Thedas in a better place than we found it.</p><p><em>The Veilguard </em>is an idealistic game, but it’s one that BioWare has earned the right to make. <em>Dragon Age</em>’s legacy has been one of constantly shifting identity, at least two counts of development hell, and a desire to give players a sandbox to roleplay in. Perhaps, as <em>Dragon Age </em>likely comes to a close, it’s better to leave the series with a game as optimistic as the people who made it. I can’t think of a more appropriate finale than one that represents the world its creators hope to see, even as the world we live in now gives us every reason to fall into despair.</p><p>In <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/dragon-age-veilguard-4-review-dreadwolf-rook-action-rpg-1851681954?_gl=1*1qxy3gl*_ga*MTMxODc3NjkwMi4xNzI1Njc2NzM3*_ga_V4QNJTT5L0*czE3NDk3NDk3MDkkbzI2OSRnMSR0MTc0OTc0OTc1NiRqMTMkbDAkaDA.&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/dragon-age-veilguard-4-review-dreadwolf-rook-action-rpg-1851681954?_gl=1*1qxy3gl*_ga*MTMxODc3NjkwMi4xNzI1Njc2NzM3*_ga_V4QNJTT5L0*czE3NDk3NDk3MDkkbzI2OSRnMSR0MTc0OTc0OTc1NiRqMTMkbDAkaDA.">my review of <em>The Veilguard</em></a></span>,<em> </em>I signed off expressing hope for BioWare’s future that feels a bit naive in retrospect. Would a divisive but undeniably polished RPG that felt true to the studio’s history be enough when, after 10 years of development, c-suite suits were probably looking for a decisive cultural moment? That optimism was just about a video game. Having lived through the past 32 years, looking back, most of the optimism I’ve ever held feels naive. I think I’m losing hope that the world will get any better. But even if we haven’t reached <em>The Veilguard</em>’s idealized vision, I’ll take some comfort in knowing someone previously at BioWare still believes it’s possible.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
