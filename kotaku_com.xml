            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Apple just released the AirPods Pro 3 a few weeks ago and finally added AI features that Samsung’s Galaxy Buds 3 Pro have had for nearly a year now. Samsung got ahead with AI features in its Galaxy Buds 3 Pro, which launched way back and still remain at the top of their game. From a value perspective, they’re even more compelling now with this <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4703/">post-Prime Day deal on Amazon that drops them to a record low of $172, down from their usual $249 price</a>.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4703/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<p>The <strong>AI integration goes beyond marketing buzzwords</strong> and actually improves your listening experience in practical ways. The Galaxy Buds 3 Pro use machine learning to analyze your ear canal shape and ambient noise conditions, then automatically adjust sound output to optimize audio quality for your specific situation. This means the earbuds adapt when you move from a quiet office to a loud street, or when you switch from music to podcasts, adjusting EQ and volume levels on the fly. The real-time translation feature lets you have conversations across language barriers with audio playing directly in your ears as someone speaks in another language. This AI capability <strong>transforms these earbuds into a communication tool rather than just an audio device</strong>.</p>
<h2>Active Noise Cancellation That Really Works</h2>
<p>The<strong> active noise canceling system incorporates multiple microphones</strong> that cancel out external noise over the full frequency spectrum. Rumble from motors or HVAC is cancelled out very effectively, while mid-level noise such as voice conversations and typing on the keyboard drop into the background. The adaptive ANC modulates the level depending on where you are so you’re not draining the battery with full cancellation when you’re already sitting in silence. Ambient sound mode does the opposite, streaming external sounds in over the microphones so you hear announcements, traffic, or brisk conversations without removing the earbuds.</p>



<p>Samsung reworked the fit around the Galaxy Buds 3 Pro based on complaints from previous iterations. The new blade design with tilted nozzles fit deeper into the ear canal with more even pressure distribution. It makes a difference during exercises, commutes or marathon listening sessions where ill-fitting earbuds will fall out or make uncomfortable pressure points. The <strong>IP57 rating also means dust and water resistance</strong>&nbsp;so you won’t harm them by sweating during exercise or getting caught in the rain. The protective coverage even extends to immersion under up to one meter’s depth of water for 30 minutes, although you won’t be swimming with them.</p>



<p><strong>Sound quality is improved by dual-driver construction</strong> that decouples the low frequency from the mid and high frequency response. The low end is covered by a specialized woofer and the high end and midrange by a specialized tweeter. The decoupling makes for clearer sound with better detail compared to single-driver earbuds that are not capable of accurately playing the full frequency response.</p>
<p>Battery life is around six hours with ANC enabled and around eight hours with ANC disabled. The <strong>charging case adds around 20 hours or so</strong>&nbsp;so you’ll have enough time before you’ll want to recharge. Fast charging will give you around an hour’s play from five minutes’ charging if time is extremely limited. The Amazon Exclusive version comes with a two-year warranty rather than the one-year coverage you get otherwise, so you have even greater assurance for your pound.</p>
<p>The all-time low price makes the earbuds an extremely smart purchase this time.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/jackerys-1500w-power-station-is-cheaper-than-during-prime-day-looks-like-amazons-selling-at-cost-2000634122</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/jackery%E2%80%99s-1500w-power-station-is-cheaper-than-during-prime-day-looks-like-amazon%E2%80%99s-selling-at-cost.1322410/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Prime Big Deal Day took place from October 7th through October 8th, and Amazon doubled down from July’s Prime Day by cutting the price to all-time lows on nearly all product lines. The Jackery Explorer 1000 portable power station dropped to an all-time low during the sales event and <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3722/">remains at that same $429 price point, down from the $799 price point consumers will pay until existing stock is sold out</a>.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3722/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<p>This product has been the <strong>category’s number one bestseller on Amazon</strong> since the first day of the month. Power outages, camping excursions, tailgating parties and even emergency planning all have one thing in common: the need for good backup electricity that doesn’t come from noisy gas-based generators. The Jackery product addresses this very same issue by delivering clean, silent power that you can tote around with one hand and enjoy indoors without hassle from fumes nor carbon monoxide.</p>
<p>The Explorer 1000 stores a 1,070Wh LiFePO4 battery capacity into an amazingly <strong>small package weighing only 23.8 pounds</strong>. That capability translates into tangible runtime in the real world: you’ll power a mini-fridge for around 10 hours, power a CPAP machine overnight over multiple nights, sustain laptops and cellphones for multiple days, or power LED lights for an extended time. With<strong> the 1,500W continuous AC output but 3,000W surge peak</strong>, this power station supports appliances drawing much power during startups such as refrigerators, portable air conditioners, or electric kettles.</p>



<h2>Speeding Up Charges and Lasting Batteries That Alter the Equation</h2>
<p>The <strong>fast charging for one hour is quite impressive</strong> and is only accessed by activating the emergency charging mode from the Jackery app. It is ideal when you are aware bad weather is imminent or you want to quickly get it topped up before you leave. The standard charging mode will take 1.7 hours for full charging that is something the manufacturers made deliberate for the best preservation of long-term battery health. The slow charging decreases the strain on the cell from the battery, giving them an extended lifespan.</p>



<p>LiFePO4 batteries are the key to this power station’s longevity: Unlike standard lithium-ion batteries that degrade relatively quickly, LiFePO4 chemistry maintains over 70% of original capacity even after 4,000 charge cycles. In practical terms, if you fully charge and discharge this power station once per week, <strong>it’ll still perform well after a decade of use</strong>.</p>
<p>The port assortment accomodates the majority of general devices and setups. <strong>Three pure sine AC outlets</strong> supply clean power safe for sensitive electronics such as laptops, medical equipment, and digital-control-enabled modern appliances.<strong> Two USB-C ports supply up to 100W PD fast charging</strong>&nbsp;so you’ll be able to charge contemporary laptops at full speed without the need for heavy power adapters. One is relegated to older devices, with the <strong>DC car port supporting 12V accessories</strong>.</p>
<p>The Jackery app adds smart controls that actually improve the user experience: You can switch between charging modes, monitor battery levels and power draw in real time, and <strong>activate the 30dB quiet overnight charging mode</strong> when noise matters. Energy efficiency mode adjusts output to reduce waste when powering low-draw devices. The integrated LED lights provide emergency illumination without draining your phone’s battery.</p>
<p>Coming in at $429, this Jackery Explorer 1000 brings serious power capacity, and decade-spanning battery longevity all for almost half the going price.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/bose-is-quietly-selling-its-qc-headphones-at-a-new-record-low-after-prime-day-to-clear-out-stock-2000634117</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/bose-is-quietly-selling-its-qc-headphones-at-a-new-record-low-after-prime-day-to-clear-out-stock.1322389/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Amazon’s October answer to the summer Prime Day event (Prime Big Deal Day) just wrapped up but some of the best deals are still hanging around. The <strong>Bose QuietComfort headphones</strong> are a perfect example, <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4702/">now sitting at a record low of $199, down from their usual $349 price</a>. These are the most popular premium noise-canceling headphones in the world for a reason: they solve the problem of trying to focus, relax, or enjoy music in noisy environments better than almost anything else on the market.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4702/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<p>The Bose QuietComfort headphones’ active noise cancellation does what the name suggests – canceling out noise – <strong>by using microphones to listen for external noise and then creating countering sound waves to eliminate the noise</strong>. This all occurs in real time so background noise such as engine rumble, air flow from the air conditioning or background chatter all get greatly alleviated. Bose overlays this with passive noise isolation from the over-ear design itself where the cushy earcup cushions form an actual physical seal around the ears. The active-passive noise reduction mixture makes that classic <em>“quiet bubble”</em> result that makes the headphones so desirable among travelers and remote workers.</p>
<h2>Comfort Engineering That Makes All-Day Wear Actually Possible</h2>
<p>The earcup cushions incorporate soft materials that wrap around your ears without applying too much force and <strong>distributes weight evenly so you don’t feel any pressure points</strong>. The cushioned headband keeps the headphones firmly in place during movement but doesn’t develop that ill-fitting clamp sensation causing headaches after an hour. The design for comfort is important because these headphones <strong>provide up to 24 hours of battery power from one charging</strong>. That’s multiple intercontinental flights, some workweeks, or an infinite number of daily commutes before you have to recharge them. Should you unexpectedly run low, 15 minutes of charging provides 2.5 hours of subsequent playtime which is enough to get you through the rest of your trip or workweek.</p>



<p>Two modes for listening give you the choice depending on the circumstances: <em>Quiet Mode</em> engages full noise cancellation as much as possible, ideal when you’re working or sleeping on a trip. <em>Aware Mode</em> does the reverse and uses external microphones to feed external sounds so you’ll hear announcements or traffic without having to lift the headphones.</p>



<p>The high-fidelity audio reproduction provides <strong>excellent sound throughout the frequency spectrum</strong> with the EQ settings in the Bose app allowing you to tailor the bass, midrange, and treble to suit. Some users desire booming bass for dance/electronica, while others want well-balanced reproduction for classical or jazz. The app puts the settings in your hand so the same headphones suit varied genres and individual taste.</p>
<p>The multipoint Bluetooth connectivity allows you to <strong>connect to multiple devices at the same time</strong>&nbsp;so the headphones remain connected to laptop and phone. If you receive an incoming call on the phone while you’re streaming something on the laptop, the headphones will automatically switch to the phone without needing you to manually detach from one device and connect to the other.</p>
<p>The packaged audio cable with the in-line microphone gives you the option of going wired when you don’t have access to Bluetooth or when the battery dies. This is the kind of feature that is actually useful on outdated airplane entertainment sets or where wireless connectivity is not an option. At $199, you get flagship-level noise cancellation and excellent battery life all at close to half the full price.</p>

              <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/assassins-creed-shadows-review-is-it-good-xbox-ps5-rpg-1851770647"><em>Assassin’s Creed Shadows</em></a> hasn’t officially been announced for Switch 2 yet but a new leaked retailer listing all but confirms it. It’ll be the second big open-world blockbuster to arrive on the new Nintendo console from Ubisoft following <a href="https://kotaku.com/star-wars-outlaws-switch-2-port-patch-is-it-good-2000624465"><em>Star Wars Outlaws</em>‘ arrival&nbsp;back in September</a>.</p> <p>Like that sci-fi stealth adventure, the “physical” version of <em>Assassin’s Creed Shadows</em> on Switch 2 will be <a href="https://kotaku.com/star-wars-outlaws-switch-2-game-key-card-2000623413">a game key card</a>. That shouldn’t be too surprising considering <a href="https://x.com/MikeOdysseyYT/status/1976767268764705115">its size</a> on every other platform is over 100GB. The <a href="https://www.auchan.fr/assassin-s-creed-shadows-nintendo-switch-2/pr-C1851867">Auchan listing</a> that leaked the apparent port doesn’t confirm a release date or price, though it seems a good guess it will be $70 and potentially arrive before the end of the year.</p>

 <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">Assassin's Creed Shadows (Switch 2 Key Card) listed at a retailer <a href="https://t.co/P1tsWNMBBm">https://t.co/P1tsWNMBBm</a> <a href="https://t.co/h9E10PoNHN">pic.twitter.com/h9E10PoNHN</a></p> <p>— Wario64 (@Wario64) <a href="https://twitter.com/Wario64/status/1976762547958423703?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 10, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <p><em>Assassin’s Creed Shadows</em> is one of the most visually impressive games on PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X/S, and it’ll be interesting to see if Ubisoft can get it looking anywhere near as good on Switch 2. The port of <em>Star Wars Outlaws</em> included ray-tracing and other current-gen features, making it a decent version of the 2024 mercenary sim.</p> <p>Other big third-party ports for the Switch 2 are still MIA. <em>Final Fantasy VII Remake</em> won’t arrive until early 2026. <em>Elden Ring</em> doesn’t even have a release date yet. And <em>Borderlands 4</em> was recently indefinitely delayed despite originally being due out earlier this month. So far at least, the Switch 2 seems in a good position to get a surprising number of last-gen and current-gen blockbusters. It’s just taking a bit longer than some might have hoped.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/borderlands-4-legendary-drop-rate-bosses-patch-notes-nerf-2000634114</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/borderlands-4-player-kills-3-000-bosses-to-discover-disappointingly-low-legendary-drop-rate.1322368/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>There are two ways to <a href="https://kotaku.com/borderlands-4-the-kotaku-review-bugs-pc-performance-ending-gearbox-ps5-2000627149">approach <em>Borderlands</em> <em>4</em></a>. One is as a colorful sci-fi comic book sandbox where people say entertaining stuff as you shoot things in the face. The other is as a claw-game lottery to be mathematically solved, with players optimizing strategies to earn prizes as efficiently as possible. Both of those things can be fun! The magic of a great loot shooter is in making those two approaches feel like one and the same.</p> <p>One player decided to go full tilt in the numbers direction and Excel the shit out of <em>Borderlands 4</em>‘s loot RNG. The result after 3,000 boss kills, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Borderlands4/comments/1o0q032/bl4_drop_rate_data_3000_kills/">published on the subreddit in a color-coded spreadsheet for all to see</a>, was a legendary drop rate that felt surprisingly stingy at just 5 percent. They want Gearbox to increase it.</p>

 <p>“I think 10 percent is the sweet spot for dedicated items for two reasons,”&nbsp; the player, who goes by Siphonicfir, <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/i-want-to-know-what-sort-of-odds-i-am-trying-to-beat-when-i-am-grinding-a-game-150-hours-and-over-3000-boss-kills-later-a-superfan-has-worked-out-borderlands-4s-disappointingly-low-drop-rate">told<em> IGN</em></a>.&nbsp; “One reason is precedent, as that was the drop rate in <em>Borderlands 2</em>. I think that game is widely regarded as the best game in the franchise, and I am almost certain the community thinks it was the best game for farming. Ten percent created a perfect balance where a drop always feels special, but you never go too long without one.”</p>

   <p>That might feel purely like vibes talking, but Siphonicfir points out that while a 5-percent drop rate means you’re averaging one Legendary drop every 20 boss kills, the far end of the range means there are players out there going a lot longer without getting anything meaningful, especially if they’re trying to farm specific pieces of equipment.</p>

 <p>They explained further:</p> <blockquote><p>For example in my data the longest cold streak was when I farmed Fractis. It took 96 runs to get a single UAV grenade to drop. The odds of not getting the item 96 consecutive times at a 5 percent drop rate are about 1 in 137. In stark contrast, at a 10 percent drop chance, the odds of going cold for 96 trials in a row are just 1 in 24,703. Going from 5 percent to 10 percent isn’t just doubling the chance, it’s reducing the worst possible outlier outcomes by a factor of 180. Those outcomes make people give up or quit due to frustration and should be limited as much as possible. An increase to 10% would make a world of difference in limiting the most egregious outlier scenarios.</p></blockquote> <p>Time will tell if the developers at Gearbox end up agreeing with Siphonicfir’s logic. It’s easier to make a game more generous than it is to turn off the reward spigot, so studios have an incentive to wait and see before course correcting too far in favor of showering players with extra loot.</p>

 <h2>Nerfs and mod warnings</h2> <p>In the meantime, Gearbox is trying to get some weapon balancing issues sorted <a href="https://kotaku.com/borderlands-4-pearls-roadmap-takedown-dlc-free-update-2000621708">ahead of future content updates</a>. Some players have been running around <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GONnYPDIHq0">one-shotting bosses</a> for a few weeks now, and that little festival of unintended build consequences is coming to an end. The <a href="https://borderlands.2k.com/borderlands-4/update-notes/">October 9 patch notes</a> detailed a litany of changes, including a big buff to Hellwalker base damage and pistol reworks. Assault rifles are supposed to <a href="https://x.com/grantkao/status/1975989364258897947">get some love</a> a little later on, too. But clock is ticking on those broken builds too, with some big nerfs slated for the mid-October patch.</p>

 <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">We have future content like the upcoming Invincible that we want players to find challenge/accomplishment in. If we balanced that content around bad gear, it would remove build diversity, forcing players into specific builds using said gear.</p> <p>— Graeme Timmins (@ProdigyXL) <a href="https://twitter.com/ProdigyXL/status/1976485366384210394?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 10, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <p>“Small update this week before a larger one next week,” creative director Graeme Timmins posted on X. “There will be some changes next week to specific gear and those unintended interactions.” He explained the team’s reasoning in response to criticism from some fans of nerfs in a non-competitive, mostly single-player game. “We have future content like the upcoming Invincible that we want players to find challenge/accomplishment in. If we balanced that content around bad gear, it would remove build diversity, forcing players into specific builds using said gear,” Timmins <a href="https://x.com/ProdigyXL/status/1976485366384210394">wrote</a> back.</p> <p>Also, beware of some of those popular mods floating around for <em>Borderlands 4</em> on PC. One of them lets players skip all of the dialogue in the game, a feature fans are requesting be added in an official update at some point to make it easier to keep grinding through the campaign. Easier said than done, according to the development team. “I’d be cautious using this mod; skipping dialog could lead to broken mission states that might not be recoverable,” Timmins <a href="https://x.com/ProdigyXL/status/1976079573768138920">posted on X</a>. Skip the writing and performance teams’ hard work at your own peril!</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/just-three-days-after-prime-day-bose-offloads-its-tv-soundbar-at-a-new-record-low-price-2000634100</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><em>Prime Big Deal Day</em> may have officially wrapped up, but Amazon isn’t done surprising us just yet. The retailer is keeping the momentum going through the weekend with some unexpected deals that are actually getting better. Case in point: the <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3727/">Bose TV speaker has dropped to a record low of $199, down from its regular $279 price tag</a>. Even better? This <strong>deal isn’t locked behind Prime membership</strong> anymore, so everyone can grab it.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3727/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<p>If you’ve been struggling to hear dialogue in your favorite shows or constantly reaching for the remote to adjust volume during movies, this compact soundbar addresses exactly that problem. <strong>Bose built this speaker specifically to make voices clearer and more distinct</strong>&nbsp;which means no more missing crucial plot points or asking “what did they say?” every five minutes.</p>
<p>Measuring slightly <strong>over 2 inches in height and 23.38 inches wide by 4.02 inches deep</strong>, this soundbar sits unobtrusively in front of most TVs without obscuring the screen or seeming cumbersome. The black finish blends seamlessly with any living room décor but if counter space is limited, you can wall-mount the device using separately purchased brackets. What makes this soundbar actually worth the money is the<strong> dual full-range drivers located at an angle to develop the wider soundstage</strong>. Rather than having audio blasted directly at you in one flat plane, the angled drivers reflect the sound around your room for a naturally immersive experience that better reflects the way we actually perceive things in the real world.</p>



<h2>Good Clear Dialogue That Finally Does the Hype Justice</h2>
<p>Setup couldn’t be any easier: You’ll pair the soundbar with the TV using the provided optical audio cable or an HDMI-ARC cable (the latter is sold separately). In minutes, you’re finished. The system has <strong>three input options total to work with: HDMI, optical, and auxiliary</strong> so you have versatility depending on what ports are open on your TV. Connected, the provided remote control provides you with access to an optional dialogue mode that further highlights speech clarity. There’s also an optional bass boost mode when you need the low-end kick for action scenes or music.</p>

              <p>Capcom Cup 12, with its finals scheduled for March of next year, is set to be the first pay-per-view livestream for a major <em>Street Fighter</em> tournament. On Friday, however, the Japanese publisher might change how much it charges players to watch it. That’s in response to <a href="https://kotaku.com/street-fighter-6-capcom-cup-12-ppv-ticket-price-2000630340">a furious backlash</a> from fans and competitive pros alike to what would be a controversial milestone for professional esports.</p> <p>“Currently, we are considering price adjustments for the paid live viewing,” Capcom announced on X earlier today, according to the platforms’ auto-translation. “We plan to make another announcement regarding the pricing of live viewing tickets, as well as the background and intent behind it, by late October.”</p>

 <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="ja" dir="ltr">＜カプコンeSportsイベント 有料チケットに関するお知らせ＞<br>本日より「CAPCOM CUP 12」「ストリートファイターリーグ: ワールドチャンピオンシップ 2025」の国技館の会場観戦チケットの抽選販売受付を開始いたします。</p> <p>▼詳しくはこちら▼<a href="https://t.co/UdNZJzoxUf">https://t.co/UdNZJzoxUf</a>…</p> <p>— CAPCOM eSports (@CAPCOM_eSports) <a href="https://twitter.com/CAPCOM_eSports/status/1976528542889545892?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 10, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <p>While fans can pay to attend the tournament live in-person, they’ll also have to pay to watch it live online. Right now the ticket price is $40 for two days of matches. That’s as much as it currently costs to buy <em>Street Fighter 6</em>. While some fans are against Capcom charging at all, others might be satisfied if the publisher simply lowers the price, or rolls the ticketing into a broader package that also includes in-game cosmetics.</p>

 <p>Capcom’s retreat comes a week after S<em>treet Fighter 6</em> director Takayuki Nakayama confirmed on social media that the development team was not consulted about the pay-per-view pricing for the more than $1 million prize pool event. “It may sound strange, but it’s true,” he <a href="https://x.com/takaNakayama/status/1973626143187280262">wrote</a>. “Revenue targets and assigned tasks differ fundamentally by department. Even the development team was surprised by this announcement. (At least Matsumoto and I were shocked at the venue). That said, since this matter occurred within the same company, we are currently discussing it. We apologize for any concern this may have caused.”</p>

 <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">For example, the initiatives we implemented in the previous title. That was a proposal from the development team—it was tough but fun.<br>Since then, the organization has grown significantly, and various departments have been established.<br>My main responsibilities now are improving…</p> <p>— TAKA-nakayama (@takaNakayama) <a href="https://twitter.com/takaNakayama/status/1973633016691040448?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 2, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <p>He also confirmed that there was no discussions about including tickets for the livestream in add-on content for the game, like a World Championship costume set. Nakayama even added that he’d delete his post if he got “scolded at work” for it. That clearly hasn’t happened.</p> <p>“We kindly ask for your patience until then,” Capcom told fans today. “We sincerely appreciate your continued support for Capcom eSports events.”</p>

              <p>Popular streamer Charles White Jr., aka Cr1TiKal/MoistCr1TiKaL, that long-haired dude who seems to be a pretty good person, has taken the unusual step of shutting off his YouTube memberships and Super Chats. Instead of prompting his viewers to throw money at the screen, he’s instead urging folks to donate to charity. “There are so many better options for your money,” he said.</p> <p>As <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/there-are-so-many-better-options-for-your-money-popular-streamer-turns-off-all-donation-tells-fans-to-give-to-charity/">first reported by <i>VGC</i></a>, White has posted a video announcing that he’s shut off user-donated monetization on his YouTube channel, and saying that he’d shut off Twitch subs as well if he could. “I would say toodle-oo, give it a strong slap on the ass, tell it good game and goodbye.” But apparently it’s harder than that. Still, he stressed that money spent on his stream could be put to better use:</p> <p>There are so many good charities doing extremely good work that could be benefited greatly from your contribution. Like maybe you’d want to donate to a charity that’s doing extremely important work in Gaza. That would be a significantly better use of that money than donating it to me.</p>
