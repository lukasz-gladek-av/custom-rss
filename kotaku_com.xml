Most weapons you can get in the game drop with two random perks which do everything from increase reload speed to more interesting stuff like add elemental explosions to precision hits. </p><p>Some perk combinations are considered much, much better than others based on their synergy with the weapon’s underlying stats and the broader meta governing  character builds at any given point in time. These combinations are called god rolls and they decide whether the Legendary drop you just found is worth keeping or junk that should be immediately destroyed. In theory, perk combinations should be completely random, providing an equal chance of getting a god roll as any other possible permutation. But a new conspiracy says that’s not actually how it works, and players think they have the math to prove it. </p><p>At the heart of this scandal, which <em>Destiny </em>aficionado Paul Tassi at<em> Forbes </em>is <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.forbes.com/sites/paultassi/2024/10/24/destiny-2-is-on-the-verge-of-its-biggest-scandal-in-history/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/paultassi/2024/10/24/destiny-2-is-on-the-verge-of-its-biggest-scandal-in-history/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">calling potentially the biggest in the game’s history</a></span>, is a new grenade launcher called VS Chill Inhibitor. It was just added to the game in <em>Episode: Revenant</em>, the second content update since <em>The Final Shape</em> expansion in June, as one of the legendary drops in the new Vesper’s Host dungeon. The god roll perks are Envious Arsenal and Bait and Switch, which reload the weapon from reserves and increase damage, respectively. Both are activated by doing damage with other weapons, making it an easy to use but highly effective threat. </p><p>But players have been farming the first encounter in the Vesper’s Host dungeon ad nauseum and struggling to score this particular god roll more than seemingly any other in recent memory. Theories immediately emerged shortly after the dungeon went live that there must be some sort of bug on Bungie’s end that is unintentionally making the god roll for VS Chill Inhibitor shockingly rare. One player’s data <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://x.com/SparkD2_/status/1848142767102317000&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://x.com/SparkD2_/status/1848142767102317000" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">testing this hypothesis</a></span> blew up over the weekend, so much so that Bungie decided to respond directly. </p><p>“Hey all, we had a conversation with our Sandbox folks this morning about this,” the <em>Destiny</em> team Twitter account <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://x.com/Destiny2Team/status/1848473860905308232&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://x.com/Destiny2Team/status/1848473860905308232" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">wrote on October 21</a></span>. “There is no perk weighting active for any legendary weapon perks in <em>Destiny 2</em>.  We have added perk attunement for Exotic Class Items in a recent update, but that’s a different system.” It seemed like an open-and-shut case, with the denial leaving no wiggle room for alternate interpretations or theories. Days later, however, players have continued running the numbers and are finding Bungie’s refutation even harder to believe. </p><p>Here’s the crux of the conspiracy as its taken shape this week, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://x.com/T1Vendetta/status/1849078033874833478&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://x.com/T1Vendetta/status/1849078033874833478" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">as articulated by T1Vendetta</a></span>. It’s not that Bungie is intentionally making the most desirable god rolls for weapons harder to get than other perk combinations, but rather that its RNG code is randomly favoring some combinations over others. Specifically, there’s an idea that perks which are listed further away from one another in the tables for Bungie’s API for <em>Destiny 2</em> are less likely to appear together, while those closer in proximity drop together much more frequently. So while these disparities are actually happening all the time, players only notice them when a weapon’s god roll happens to combine two perks that are unusually far away from one another in the table. </p><p>An analysis by <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://youtu.be/7fzC-FmJVmY&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://youtu.be/7fzC-FmJVmY" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">YouTuber Skarrow9</a></span> walks players through the theory in more detail and showcases anecdotal player data and crowdsourced research to back it up. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/DestinyTheGame/comments/1gaprxd/its_not_just_chill_inhibitor_all_weapons_from/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/DestinyTheGame/comments/1gaprxd/its_not_just_chill_inhibitor_all_weapons_from/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">There’s a growing suspicion in the community</a></span> that this is actually due to a bug dating back to the release of <em>The Final Shape</em>, as evidenced by the unusual perk distribution drop rates for a grenade launcher reissued in that expansion <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://x.com/mossy_max/status/1849246476041605224&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://x.com/mossy_max/status/1849246476041605224" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">called Truthteller</a></span>. “At this point, it would seem there’s no malice being directed at or from Bungie in this, but the data is there,” wrote a player on the subreddit <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/DestinyTheGame/comments/1gajidc/stop_farming_vs_chill_inhibitor_2_electric/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/DestinyTheGame/comments/1gajidc/stop_farming_vs_chill_inhibitor_2_electric/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">in one of the many popular threads</a></span> discussing the issue. “Whether it’s a bug or issue with how perks are generated, we just want answers or further investigation.”</p><p>There are already some players trying to sleuth out how a bug like this might sneak into the game without Bungie detecting it, with one guess being that it’s due to a hidden bias somewhere in however the RNG is programmed for perk drops at the moment. Bungie hasn’t weighed back in to clarify if the community is still tilting at windmills or there really is some deeper problem at work that’s keeping players from getting the god roll they want. Whatever the actual truth of the matter turns out to be, the entire ordeal has players grappling with a much larger question: was Destiny’s loot chase <em>ever</em> actually good?</p><p>The game has always tried to walk a tightrope between giving players what they want when they want it and making them grind for it until they get lucky. Making loot easy and straightforward to attain would defeat the purpose of the game, but at some point too much busy work and RNG can make the whole thing feel more like operating a slot machine than actually having fun. These trade-offs, and how successfully Bungie is balancing them, have been at the forefront this month, especially because weapon crafting was semi-retired. </p><p>That system used to work as a source of bad-luck protection that eventually let players forge the exact god roll they wanted whether it ever dropped or not. It was a double-edged sword, however, because it also made actual god rolls redundant when players did happen upon them. Instead of grinding to unlock crafting patterns to make their preferred gun, players are now just back to toiling away in the same activities over and over again waiting to get lucky. As someone who returned to the <em>Destiny 2 </em>loot mines this month, it definitely sucks. </p><p>“The advantage of weapon crafting will always be superior to grinding weapons mindlessly,” <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/DestinyTheGame/comments/1gaunvv/the_advantage_of_weapon_crafting_will_always_be/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/DestinyTheGame/comments/1gaunvv/the_advantage_of_weapon_crafting_will_always_be/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">reads one post</a></span> that recently gained a lot of attention on the subreddit. User lordofabyss basically argues that managing multiple rolls across dozens of weapons because you don’t know which one might unexpectedly become part of the future meta is a pain and a mess. It’s also a drag for those who don’t, for whatever reason, ever actually get the god roll they were chasing. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/DestinyTheGame/comments/1gawuzl/as_someone_who_could_personally_take_or_leave/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/DestinyTheGame/comments/1gawuzl/as_someone_who_could_personally_take_or_leave/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Another big thread points out that</a></span>, regardless of crafting, the overall level of rewards for harder activities in <em>Destiny 2</em> feel needlessly stingy. There’s nothing worse than running dungeon or raid encounters for an hour and getting nothing useful. </p><p>One conversation on Twitter put these long-standing issues with <em>Destiny 2 </em>in the context of MMOs more generally, which Bungie’s game has slowly become over the years. “RNG is RNG,” <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://x.com/CammyCakesYT/status/1848780678608957651&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://x.com/CammyCakesYT/status/1848780678608957651" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">tweeted</a></span> CammyCakesYT. “Regardless of if there is an unknown underlying bug...<em>Destiny 2</em> grind feels bad compared to other games bc it has always been missing: Player trading, Crafting system for complex modifications, Cosmetics to use spare currency on.” Without diving deep into the weeds of <em>Destiny 2</em>'s loot chase compared to those in games like<em> Final Fantasy XIV</em>, <em>Diablo IV</em>, or <em>Warframe</em>, one thing it’s clearly suffering from at the moment is the fact that god rolls are essentially the<em> only</em> thing to chase right now. </p><p>Maybe that will change with <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/destiny-2-codename-frontiers-loot-expansions-free-1851643541&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/destiny-2-codename-frontiers-loot-expansions-free-1851643541">next year’s ambitious <em>Codename: Frontier</em> plans</a></span>, which Bungie has said will borrow from metroidvanias and roguelikes to structure content in ways that potentially feels more fresh and satisfying. For now, bugged god rolls or not, the state of <em>Destiny 2</em> is feeling a bit shallow. The new dungeon is excellent and the potion-based tonic system this Episode is a really cool idea, but the underlying grind holding it altogether is feeling weaker than it has in a long time. </p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Everyone loves the <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/resident-evil-2-the-kotaku-review-1831951036&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/resident-evil-2-the-kotaku-review-1831951036"><em>Resident Evil 2 </em>remake</a></span> that was released a few years back, as well as <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/resident-evil-4-re4-remaster-remake-review-capcom-ps5-1850278891&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/resident-evil-4-re4-remaster-remake-review-capcom-ps5-1850278891"><em>Resident Evil 4</em></a></span><em> </em>from just last year, but my favorite of the bunch is <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/resident-evil-7-the-kotaku-review-1791658385&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/resident-evil-7-the-kotaku-review-1791658385"><em>RE7</em> <em>Biohazard</em></a></span>. It’s the first game in the series that I ever completed, and it’s one of the most effective horror games I’ve ever played. It turns out that a more methodical approach, a change in perspective, and a creepy Louisiana swamp and manor were all I needed to finally get into the series. <strong>You can pick up <em>Resident Evil 7 Biohazard </em>and all its DLC in the gold edition, which is available for just $16.</strong></p></div><div><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/dead-space-2023-remake-review-kotaku-pc-ps5-1850050062&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/dead-space-2023-remake-review-kotaku-pc-ps5-1850050062"><em>Dead Space</em></a></span><em> </em>is simply one of the best to ever do it. It was a brutal and necessary revitalization of the survival-horror genre back in 2008, and its remake inherits the finest qualities of the original while polishing its roughest edges. At a time when remakes are more prevalent than ever—and they often buck the trend by being more stylistic reinterpretations rather than 1:1 retellings—the latest <em>Dead Space </em>is shockingly faithful, and it’s a welcome sight. If it ain’t broke, don’t fix it, and <em>Dead Space </em>is incredibly smart to leave well enough alone. However, it also brings the original’s already sky-high production values to an even more elevated level, making it one of the most robust and impressive horror packages available. <em><strong>Dead Space </strong></em><strong>is only $21 right now, but alternatively you can pick it up on EA Play through Game Pass.</strong></p></div><div><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/alien-isolation-2-sequel-confirmed-announced-sega-ca-1851666754&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/alien-isolation-2-sequel-confirmed-announced-sega-ca-1851666754"><em>Alien: Isolation </em>is <em>finally </em>receiving a sequel</a></span>, which seemed like such an easy layup when it first set the world on fire ten years ago. That means that this first-person horror game is now essential material to get to before that sequel is eventually released. And what a great time you’re about to have with it, because <em>Alien: Isolation </em>is an all-timer. </p><p>Talk about ridiculously high production values; <em>Isolation </em>nails the retro-futuristic vision of the dystopian capitalist nightmare Ridley Scott’s film so thoroughly brought to life. The gadgetry that you use in <em>Isolation</em>, and the surfaces of the station you explore, all seem positively ripped from the set of <em>Alien</em>. Best of all, it makes a tangible and menacing threat of the Xenomorph, which stalks you throughout the game. <strong>The game might be too long for its own good, but </strong><em><strong>Alien: Isolation </strong></em><strong>is still one of the most important horror games of the 2010s, and one of the very best licensed titles out there. You can now snag it for $10.</strong></p></div><div><p>I think there are fewer real things more frightening than the sea. I’ll never go to space and witness the expanse of that void for myself, but I do regularly dip my toe into the Atlantic, and that’s about as close to that experience as I’m getting. I enjoy a good beach, but it’s everything beyond them that sends a chill down my spine. The sea goes so much deeper than we can really fathom <em>(You’re fired—Ed)</em>, and hides so many freaky creatures and manners of life that are hard to conceive. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/alien-isolation-2-sequel-confirmed-announced-sega-ca-1851666754&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/alien-isolation-2-sequel-confirmed-announced-sega-ca-1851666754"><em>Dredge</em></a></span><em> </em>taps into that for its nightmare fuel.</p><p>In this Lovecraftian mystery set at sea, you are tasked with the operation of a small ship adrift on cursed waters. On your utterly horrifying voyages, you will dredge (heh) up all manner of sea creatures, from mundane fish to…other stranger things that dare not be named or looked at. At night, a fog falls over the sea that restricts your sight, plays tricks on the mind, and deteriorates your sanity unless you rest or find a safe harbor. <em>Dredge </em>is never outright terrifying, but like my favorite horror, there’s a tinge of dread everywhere you go that more than makes up for the lack of jump scares. <em><strong>Dredge </strong></em><strong>and all its DLC are available in a complete edition for $32.</strong><br></p></div><div><p>So the <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/dead-rising-ranked-best-worst-every-game-off-the-record-1851590684&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/dead-rising-ranked-best-worst-every-game-off-the-record-1851590684"><em>Dead Rising </em>games</a></span> aren’t really scary (unless you’re absolutely terrified by the passage of time) but neither is every single piece of work in the horror genre. Horror is so immensely flexible, and it is quite often actually deeply funny. <em>Dead Rising </em>takes zombies and makes them hilarious by dropping you into worlds filled with tools to mix and match, to create ridiculous weapons of mass undead slaughter—like motorcycles with chainsaws attached to them. </p><p>If hacking and slashing scores of the undead in an increasingly wacky fashion sounds like the ideal way to spend your Halloween season, then pick up any of the <em>Dead Rising </em>games that are currently discounted on Xbox.<strong> </strong><em><strong>Dead Rising 2 </strong></em><strong>and </strong><em><strong>Dead Rising 2: Off the Record </strong></em><strong>seem like the fan favorites, but </strong><em><strong>3 </strong></em><strong>and </strong><em><strong>4 </strong></em><strong>are also on sale, and all of them are going for five or six dollars right now, making them a steal no matter what.</strong></p></div><div><p>I think the <em>Metro </em>series from 4A Games are some of the tightest, weirdest, and most immersive first-person shooters on the market right now. But while <em>Exodus </em>is my favorite, it’s hard to recommend for anyone looking for a horror game right now. However, the first two games in the series—<em>Metro 2033 </em>and <em>Metro: Last Light</em>,—are both much more linear and scarier titles.</p><p>Both are mainly set in the claustrophobic tunnels of the Russian underground, which are plagued by monstrosities and supernatural phenomena that lurk in the dark. Encounters against these creatures are regularly fraught with tension, and both <em>2033 </em>and <em>Last Light </em>lean more into the rhythm and pace of the horror genre, while sprinkling in doses of human drama and psychological terror. They’re also, crucially, shorter games, meaning that you can reasonably pack all those scares into a weekend. <em><strong>Metro 2033 </strong></em><strong>and </strong><em><strong>Metro: Last Light </strong></em><strong>are each discounted to $3, or you can pick up the bundle of all three games for $9.</strong></p></div><div><p>I don’t really consider <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/prey-the-kotaku-review-1795167006&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/prey-the-kotaku-review-1795167006"><em>Prey</em></a></span><em> </em>a horror game, but it does terrify the player frequently enough that I might begin reconsidering that position. Every new room you step into is, after all, an entirely new environment that <em>could </em>be hiding a shape-shifting alien waiting to get the jump on you. Mimics aren’t even the worst thing you run into in <em>Prey</em>. Typhon alien species takes various shapes, like the always-intimidating Phantoms that blast you the minute they catch sight of you.Late in the game, a particularly huge Typhon simply hangs over you in certain areas and menaces you to no end.</p><p> There are lots of smaller moments and decisions like these that lend <em>Prey </em>the energy of a horror game, and it manages to get under your skin more effectively than a lot of attempts at horror in this medium. <strong>If you want to see for yourself how terrifying </strong><em><strong>Prey </strong></em><strong>can really be, pick it up while it’s $6, or snag it on Game Pass.</strong></p></div><div><p>First off, it goes without saying that in order to enjoy <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/undead-nightmare-2-switch-ps4-fps-port-zombies-review-1850736914&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/undead-nightmare-2-switch-ps4-fps-port-zombies-review-1850736914"><em>Undead Nightmare</em></a></span>, you must first have <em>Red Dead Redemption</em>. You might want to have played the game too, because this zombie-themed DLC functions as a bit of a goofy epilogue to the main story. However it’s worth it to be able to play <em>Undead Nightmare</em>, which is still one of the very best DLCs I’ve ever picked up. A curse has fallen over the West, resurrecting the dead in hordes and turning <em>Red Dead Redemption </em>into a campy, <em>Evil Dead</em>-ish parody of itself and the horror genre. It is wonderful.</p><p>I remember <em>Undead Nightmare </em>being particularly impressive when it was released. <em>Red Dead Redemption</em>’s vision of the dying west was always sparse, but this DLC turned that quiet contemplative isolation into something to be scared of. Scores of zombies appear seemingly out of nowhere and set on you and your horse, and the primary design of its set-piece missions involves fighting off waves of them in order to defend the few spots of civilization left. Mythical creatures, like four horses that resemble the horsemen of the apocalypse, can be found in the wild. <em>Undead Nightmare</em> utterly transforms the game in ways I didn’t think Rockstar would ever do, and it’s a trick that the developer has seemed reluctant to pull off again in the decade-and-a-half since. <strong>So if you’ve got the original game on your Xbox and $8 to spare, pick up </strong><em><strong>Undead Nightmare </strong></em><strong>and experience one of the goofiest and best DLCs to ever grace a game.</strong></p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

However, at the time, neither Stahelski nor Leitch knew who provided the last-minute investment. Producer Iwanyk only told them who saved the day after <em>John Wick</em> became a box office hit. </p><p>“[Iwanyk] took us out to dinner, and we were laughing about all the bullshit that happened, and he said: ‘By the way, funny story, you know who gap financed you?
