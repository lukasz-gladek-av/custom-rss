            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>One thing almost every soulslike fan can agree on is that fashion is often more important to us than stats. It’s true! Most of us will rock some pretty terrible armor as long as we look cool doing it. But that’s why it’s so awesome when a game offers transmog with no downsides, letting us wear the best armor for our character without sacrificing our good looks in the process.</p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="195922" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="Is Alan Wake Worth Playing Before Its Sequel? | Total Recall" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="390" data-playlist="195922,196539,196055" data-current="195922"><div><p>Is Alan Wake Worth Playing Before Its Sequel? | Total Recall</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195922/195922_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195922/195922_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195922/195922_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195922/195922_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/21438.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>Like its approach to respeccing, <em>Wuchang: Fallen Feathers</em> knocks it out of the park with its implementation of transmog. You have access to this feature right out of the gate, meaning you can swap around your looks as soon as you begin getting any new armor. And even better, you can do so at any time by just accessing the equipment menu. It costs nothing—no materials needed!</p><p>Here’s how to transmog your gear in <em>Wuchang: Fallen Feathers</em>.</p><h2 id="h308141"><a id=""></a>How to transmog your gear in <em>Wuchang: Fallen Feathers</em></h2><p>To transmog your gear in <em>Wuchang: Fallen Feathers</em>, you first need to open your menu and navigate to the equipment tab. You have four types of armor here: Head, Chest, Bracers, and Legs. As long as you have a piece of gear equipped here, you’ll see an option on the bottom of the screen that says “Alter Equipment”. Press the corresponding button to bring up a list of all of your available armor, then press “Confirm” on the option you’d like to apply as a transmog to your equipped piece of gear.</p><figure id="" data-id="07d67ca774e1edbfffcd96e5641a7af5" data-recommend-id="image://07d67ca774e1edbfffcd96e5641a7af5" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A screenshot shows a helmet in an item screen." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A screenshot shows a helmet in an item screen." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Leenzee / Billy Givens / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="07d67ca774e1edbfffcd96e5641a7af5" data-recommend-id="image://07d67ca774e1edbfffcd96e5641a7af5" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A screenshot shows a helmet in an item screen." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Alternatively, if you’d like to remove any transmog applied to a piece of gear, simply go back into the alteration menu and look for an option at the bottom of the screen that says “Remove Alteration,” then click the corresponding button. This will reset the piece of gear back to its default appearance.</p><figure id="" data-id="4350c5b3f5a12101edb16ca063691faf" data-recommend-id="image://4350c5b3f5a12101edb16ca063691faf" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A screenshot of an item menu shows various equipment." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A screenshot of an item menu shows various equipment." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Leenzee / Billy Givens / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="4350c5b3f5a12101edb16ca063691faf" data-recommend-id="image://4350c5b3f5a12101edb16ca063691faf" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A screenshot of an item menu shows various equipment." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>As for whether or not you should bother with transmog, my vote is a resounding <strong>yes</strong>! This game has some of the coolest armor I’ve seen in a soulslike in quite a while, and it’s well worth trying different pieces together to get the ultimate fit. </p><p>More importantly, transmog is especially useful because you’ll probably want to swap around equipment regularly in <em>Wuchang: Fallen Feathers</em>, as many areas are home to dangerous status effects. If you need Corruption protection but don’t like the look of that armor, just transmog it to look exactly like your favorite armor set.</p><figure id="" data-id="3f6e9b598b5d339c7358f3577ba9594f" data-recommend-id="image://3f6e9b598b5d339c7358f3577ba9594f" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The protagonist of Wuchang shows off a new fit." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="The protagonist of Wuchang shows off a new fit." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Leenzee / Billy Givens / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="3f6e9b598b5d339c7358f3577ba9594f" data-recommend-id="image://3f6e9b598b5d339c7358f3577ba9594f" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The protagonist of Wuchang shows off a new fit." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>For instance, I’m wearing some armor with fantastic Corruption protection in the photo above, but you’d never know it. Instead, I’m slayin’ it with the Pirate Set I was recently given by an NPC. I look rad while still getting all the protections I need for the area of the game I’m working through at the moment. Cool.</p><p>So, just play around with <em>Wuchang: Fallen Feathers</em>’ transmog until you get something that really suits your vibe. And since you can change it on the fly, you’re not tied down here. If you get tired of a look, switch things up again. You’re the master of your aesthetic now. Go forth and fashion.</p><hr><p><em>Wuchang: Fallen Feathers</em> is available now on PS5, Xbox Series X/S, and Windows PCs.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://kotaku.com/wuchang-transmog-alter-equipment-option-change-default-1851787261]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Sometimes, you just need to change your approach by resetting all your skill points. This is especially true in any good role-playing adventure that features a smorgasbord of build options like <em>Wuchang: Fallen Feathers</em>. Thankfully, this soulslike game incentivizes creativity and experimentation in its skill system, giving you a ton of freedom to try out different builds and styles.The game never punishes you for trying new things. Here’s why respeccing in <em>Wuchang: Fallen Feathers</em> is awesome.</p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="195752" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="Baldur's Gate 3's Karlach Actor On Playing The Beloved Barbarian" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="136" data-playlist="195752,197562,196131" data-current="195752"><div><p>Baldur's Gate 3's Karlach Actor On Playing The Beloved Barbarian</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195752/195752_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195752/195752_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195752/195752_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195752/195752_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/21263.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><h2 id="h308110"><a id=""></a>Respeccing in <em>Wuchang: Fallen Feathers</em> is a breath of fresh air</h2><p>Unlike with the respec system of many similar titles, you won’t need any rare items or resources, nor will you need to spend hard-earned money or experience when you’re ready to swap things around. Instead, <strong><em>Wuchang: Fallen Feathers</em> lets you respec any time you’d like with just a few quick button presses</strong>. </p><p>Better yet, <strong>there are no downsides to respeccing. </strong>Any Red Mercury Essence or upgrade materials you’ve used will be refunded to you in full with no downsides. This means you can respec as often as you’d like, trying entirely new builds or strategies on a whim. And given that the game features a variety of weapons and tons of options for magic and buffing, it’s a good idea to try new things as you progress through the journey.</p><p>While most games in the genre feature upgrade paths that make you feel locked into a certain weapon due to the limited availability of higher-tier materials, <em>Wuchang: Fallen Feathers</em> does away with this by lumping weapon upgrades into the skill tree. This goes a long way toward eliminating FOMO during your first run.</p><p>You’ll upgrade weapons using Red Feathers, but these are a universal material that applies to any weapon when slotted into a mastery node. So, if you want to swap from longswords to axes, you can just respec your Red Feathers to that weapon type’s mastery nodes. And just like that, any axe you use will be sporting a mastery equivalent to however many Red Feathers you’ve invested. Want to go back? Just pop ‘em back in the longsword tree instead.</p><p>The same goes for magic, skills, and so forth. It’s so refreshing that I just might cry. Whew. Anyway, here’s how to make it all happen.</p><h2 id="h308111"><a id=""></a>How to respec in <em>Wuchang: Fallen Feathers</em></h2><p>When you’re ready to respec in <em>Wuchang: Fallen Feathers</em>, head to the Impetus Repository at any shrine to access the game’s massive branching skill tree. You’ll see “Reset Points” at the bottom of the screen, so you’ll need to press the corresponding button on whichever node you’d like to refund.</p><figure id="" data-id="2d18f80c06b17423c9726c9fbcdbc620" data-recommend-id="image://2d18f80c06b17423c9726c9fbcdbc620" data-format="jpg" data-width="3840" data-height="2160" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A screenshot shows a skill tree in Wuchang being reset." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A screenshot shows a skill tree in Wuchang being reset." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Leenzee / Billy Givens / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="2d18f80c06b17423c9726c9fbcdbc620" data-recommend-id="image://2d18f80c06b17423c9726c9fbcdbc620" data-format="jpg" data-width="3840" data-height="2160" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A screenshot shows a skill tree in Wuchang being reset." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Find a node you want to refund, press the required button based on your platform of choice, then accept the prompt that shows up. Keep in mind that any nodes placed beyond that one will also be refunded, meaning you’ll lose access to any skills or upgrades from them, too. <strong>You can even refund all of your skill points by selecting this option at the large Starting Point node in the center of the tree</strong>.</p><p>As I mentioned previously, any Red Mercury Essence or upgrade materials you’ve used will be refunded in full, letting you improve the mastery of an entirely different weapon and redistribute your overall stats however you’d like. So, if you’re finding a specific weapon or build just isn’t working for you, dive in and try something else entirely. You can always go back to your old build later. What a cool game. </p><hr><p><em>Wuchang: Fallen Feathers</em> is available now on PS5, Xbox Series X/S, and Windows PCs.</p><p>.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://kotaku.com/wuchang-respec-skill-tree-red-mercury-feathers-essence-1851787254]]></content:encoded>
