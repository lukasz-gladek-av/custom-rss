But this needs to be made right.<em> Subnautica </em>has been my life’s work and I would never willingly abandon it or the amazing team that has poured their hearts into it.”</p><p>Unknown Worlds was sold to Krafton in 2022 for roughly $500 million. If the studio hit revenue targets this year, the founders were on track to get an additional $250 million payout, with a percentage of that going to the rank-and-file developers on the studio floor. But delaying<em> Subnautica 2</em>'s Early Access launch to 2026 makes hitting that goal basically impossible. Krafton says it didn’t fire them to avoid the payout, but because the founders failed to deliver a launch-quality version of <em>Subnautica 2</em> as promised. Cleveland, who directed the first game, has for his part clamed the game was ready. </p><p>There are now also alleged leaks of an internal May 2025 milestone review <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://imgur.com/a/lXgAdej&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://imgur.com/a/lXgAdej" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">floating around online</a></span> that paint a messy picture of the game’s development timeline. It includes an assessment that <em>Subnautica 2</em>'s Early Access version was too content-light to “drive IP growth and expansion” and calls for 30 percent more content, including additional biomes, creatures, and narrative chapters. If accurate, it would lend credence to Krafton’s recent claims, though for now the alleged leak remains unsubstantiated. </p><p>This would hardly be the first time that studio founders got into a messy and drawn-out fight with their parent publisher over debates about scope, timelines, and bonus payouts. The most notorious version of that was Infinity Ward leaders Vince Zampella and Jason West’s <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/infinity-ward-founders-suing-activision-over-unpaid-roy-452579213?_gl=1*2f6910*_ga*NjQ4ODc3OTQxLjE3NDgwMDgwOTM.*_ga_V4QNJTT5L0*czE3NTIyNDA5NjQkbzkkZzEkdDE3NTIyNDMzMTMkajYwJGwwJGgw&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/infinity-ward-founders-suing-activision-over-unpaid-roy-452579213?_gl=1*2f6910*_ga*NjQ4ODc3OTQxLjE3NDgwMDgwOTM.*_ga_V4QNJTT5L0*czE3NTIyNDA5NjQkbzkkZzEkdDE3NTIyNDMzMTMkajYwJGwwJGgw">high-profile 2010 lawsuit against Activision over <em>Call of Duty: Modern Warfare </em>royalties</a></span>. The litigation went on for two years before it was settled, filled with tons of wild revelations about everything from corporate espionage to Activision’s then-unannounced plans for the first <em>Destiny</em>. </p><p>We’ll see how long this lawsuit lasts and what it eventually reveals. Hopefully, Unknown Worlds’ roughly 100 employees are able to still ship a good game and get what they’re owed in the process. “As for the earnout, the idea that Max, Ted and I wanted to keep it all for ourselves is totally untrue,” Cleveland wrote in his latest update. “I’m in this industry because I love it, not for riches. Historically we’ve always shared our profits with the team and did the same when we sold the studio. You can be damned sure we’ll continue with the earnout/bonus as well. They deserve it for all their incredible work trying to get this great game into your hands.”</p><p>.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://kotaku.com/subnautica-2-delay-lawsuit-leaks-biomes-steam-krafton-1851786101]]></content:encoded>

Several of these are just common courtesy when visiting someone else’s property, such as not making loud noises and not entering a stable or pasture without permission, but others might not be as immediately obvious to folks without previous experience working with animals.</p><p>In a post on the <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://umamusume.com/visitingstables-guidelines/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://umamusume.com/visitingstables-guidelines/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">game’s official website</a></span>, Cygames notes that “there have been instances of visitors neglecting stable rules, trespassing, and photographing/filming without the stable’s consent,” which prompted the game to add these guidelines. Props to the studio for acknowledging the game’s popularity and trying to curb some of this kind of behavior. The full list of guidelines is as follows:</p><ol data-type="List" data-style="Number"><li>Contact the Kyousoba Furusato Information Center to discover if visits are possible.</li><li>Contact the Kyousoba Furusato Information Center for details on the times of visits.</li><li>Follow the instructions provided by the staff working at the stables.</li><li>Do not enter stable buildings or grazing land without permission.</li><li>Do not shout or make loud noises.</li><li>Never touch the horses. It is extremely dangerous.</li><li>Smoking is prohibited on stable land.</li><li>Do not use camera flashes.</li><li>Never feed the horses.</li></ol><p><em>Umamusume: Pretty Derby </em>was released in the West last week, and has since blown up and been featured by huge streamers like Ludwig and Northernlion playing the game on their channels. </p></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://kotaku.com/umamusume-pretty-derby-horse-girl-stable-guidelines-1851786102]]></content:encoded>
