              <p>On February 10, filmmaker Ruairí Robinson made a <a href="https://x.com/RuairiRobinson/status/2021394940757209134">bold claim on X</a>. “This was a 2 line prompt in seedance 2. If the hollywood is cooked guys are right maybe the hollywood is cooked guys are cooked too idk,” he wrote. The post was accompanied by a video of Tom Cruise and Brad Pitt performing a fight scene together. The clip gained attention for its apparent sophistication; it appeared well-choreographed, competently shot, and appropriately lit, which are all elements that other AI video tools have struggled to convincingly replicate. If Robinson’s claim was true, this was a significant leap forward in AI video technology. The kind of thing AI hype-men have been shilling for years and which has—until, if Robinson is to be believed, right now—turned out to be nothing more than <a href="https://www.shokunin.studio/blog/2024/2/15/openai-releases-text-to-video-tool-sora-and-instantly-generates-a-wave-of-social-media-spam">snake oil</a>. There’s just one problem: It’s probably still snake oil.</p> <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">This was a 2 line prompt in seedance 2. If the hollywood is cooked guys are right maybe the hollywood is cooked guys are cooked too idk. <a href="https://t.co/dNTyLUIwAV">pic.twitter.com/dNTyLUIwAV</a></p> <p>— Ruairi Robinson (@RuairiRobinson) <a href="https://twitter.com/RuairiRobinson/status/2021394940757209134?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">February 11, 2026</a></p></blockquote>  <p>Aron Peterson, a writer and software developer who has also worked in film production, post-production, and visual effects, posted a blog on his website, <a href="https://www.shokunin.studio/blog/2026/2/18/is-it-all-over-for-filmmakers">Shokunin Studio</a>, questioning Robinson’s story. “The claims being made immediately rubbed me up the wrong way,” Peterson wrote. “Other demos of the Seedance model had the usual errors we have come to expect from AI video generators [but this one didn’t].” In particular, Peterson explained, “AI video generators are really bad at simulating realistic camera moves, especially handheld shaky cam,” but in the Cruise/Pitt video, “we can see the camera movement.”</p>

 <p>So Peterson started researching <a href="https://kotaku.com/arcane-league-of-legends-ai-trailer-vi-jinx-ekko-warwick-2000666921">Seedance 2.0</a>, the new AI tool from TikTok developer ByteDance that’s <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/ckg1dl410q9o">already doing large-scale copyright infringement</a>, which Robinson used to create the video. Peterson “hopped over to Seedance’s website and it only took 10 seconds to find green screen footage of two stuntmen performing the same fight choreography we see in the Cruise vs Pitt scene,” he said. He also posted a comparison of the two videos on YouTube.</p>   <p>“Was the input really just a 2 line prompt or was it actually 2 lines, green screen video footage, and face references too?” Peterson asked. “The evidence appears to show that stuntmen were filmed from several angles, that a clip had to be generated for every angle, and then finally all clips were stitched together for marketing.” Peterson’s evidence implies that the Cruise/Pitt fight scene wasn’t entirely AI generated; instead, it was probably just face replacement and background creation laid on top of footage that already existed. As TV writer David Slack put it on <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/slack2thefuture.bsky.social">Bluesky</a>, “In other words, like most AI hype — it was a con.”</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/skate-4-grom-paywall-location-new-map-island-2000671466</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Next month, season three goes live in EA’s free-to-play reboot of <em>Skate</em>. The big new addition in the upcoming season is Grom, an island that players can visit and skate around on. However, the island, which is a slightly updated version of the tutorial island, is essentially locked behind a paywall, which goes against a promise EA made before launch.</p> <p>On February 19, <a href="https://www.ea.com/games/skate/skate/news/dev-update-s3-skatepass-grom-and-the-future">EA and Full Circle posted a blog</a> talking about some of the changes coming in <em>Skate’s</em> third season, which goes live on March 10. In the post, EA revealed that a new island will be available to skaters in the next season. But accessing this island won’t be as simple or free as fast traveling to it once the update is live.</p>

 <p>During the first month of season three, skate.Pass Premium holders will be able to visit Grom as much as they want, whenever they want. For those who haven’t paid for <em>Skate’s</em> battle pass, they’ll be locked out until April. That’s when a “very special multi-week event” will happen, and all players will be invited to Grom’s “grand opening.” After that wraps up, free access to Grom will be restricted once more to Premium pass owners. Non-paying players will be able to spend 500 rip chips, an in-game currency you earn by playing, to buy a day pass to the island.</p> <figure><figcaption>An overhead comparison of Grom during the game’s tutorial and Grom during the event provided by EA.&nbsp; (EA/Kotaku)</figcaption></figure> <p>Did you get all that? A bit confusing, but somewhat understandable for a free-to-play game. However, there’s a problem. Before the launch of <em>Skate</em> in September last year, EA made some promises about the game. <a href="https://youtu.be/FAMgtFyrQLk?t=453">In a video posted in July 2022</a>, the devs said that when they started exploring the free-to-play model, they had to set some “hard ground rules to follow.” One of those rules included “No map areas locked behind paywalls.” Whoops! It also doesn’t help that the new island is just a slightly expanded version of the game’s tutorial island, something that is very clear to see in EA’s own comparison image in the blog.</p>

 <h2>The backlash to <em>Skate</em> paywalling an island</h2> <p><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/SkateEA/comments/1r9a7oh/so_devs/">As you might expect</a>, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/SkateEA/comments/1r98r3g/ea_did_it_again/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button"><em>Skate</em> players weren’t happy</a> <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/SkateEA/comments/1r98r3g/ea_did_it_again/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button">about all of this</a> <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/SkateEA/comments/1r9akiw/what_is_this_full_circle/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button">and started flooding social media</a> <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/SkateEA/comments/1r997il/isle_of_grom/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button">and Reddit</a> <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/SkateEA/comments/1r98un6/huh_whats_that/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button">with posts</a> <a href="https://x.com/nkocharm/status/2024534025692430345">pointing out the promise EA had broken</a>. This eventually led to the official <em>Skate</em> account on <a href="https://x.com/skate/status/2024539083259654345">X posting a statement about Grom</a>.</p>

 <p>“We launched <em>Skate</em> in Early Access so we could build it with players, not behind closed doors,” EA wrote. “Since September, we’ve been updating the world, tweaking characters, and adding features our players have been asking for, and there is lots more coming. Yes, sometimes plans have to change. That’s part of the deal when you’re building in public. We’re here, we’re listening, and we’re going to keep shaping <em>Skate</em> together.”</p> <p><em>Kotaku</em> has reached out to EA for more information.</p> <p>While it is true that game development is messy, going back on this promise has opened up a can of worms. EA also promised that <em>Skate</em> would not contain paid loot boxes or pay-to-win elements. Why should players trust EA to stick to those promises if it is willing to deviate on this issue and toss an island behind a paywall, even one that can be avoided by grinding for currency?</p>

 <p>Regardless, I’m not shocked EA has decided to renege. The company is likely under pressure to make more money across all of its games after announcing its upcoming deal to sell itself to <a href="https://kotaku.com/ea-saudi-bioware-ai-lgbtq-debt-junk-bond-2000630647">Saudi Arabia and private equity goons for $55 billion</a>.</p>

              <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/how-a-rabid-xcom-fan-became-the-designer-of-enemy-unkno-5890749">Jake Solomon</a>, who previously served as creative director on <a href="https://kotaku.com/xcom-2-the-kotaku-review-1757343867"><em>XCOM 2</em></a> and <a href="https://kotaku.com/marvel-midnight-suns-impressions-xcom-firaxis-pc-rpg-1849793171"><em>Marvel’s Midnight Suns</em></a>, announced today that the studio he founded, Midsummer Studios, is closing down. Solomon created Midsummer Studios in 2024 with the goal of “reinvent[ing] the life sim genre,” according to a <a href="https://www.midsummerstudios.com/news/studio-announcement">press release</a> from the time. <a href="https://x.com/SolomonJake/status/2024510423190430181">In a post on X</a> announcing the closure, Solomon wrote, “We built a studio, we made a game, and I’m really proud of both. Before we close the doors at Midsummer Studios I’d like to share a glimpse of <em>Burbank</em>, the game we poured our hearts into. It’s like “Life Sims + <em>The Truman Show</em>,” but it’s more than that. I believe people are storytellers, and I want them to share whatever stories and characters they can dream up. Burbank let’s you do that.”</p> <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">We built a studio, we made a game, and I'm really proud of both.

In order to do that, <a href="https://x.com/SolomonJake/status/2024511003917009256">Solomon disclosed in a follow-up post</a>, “Our characters use AI for memory, reasoning and speech. That’s what let’s you create anyone you want and drop them in any story you write. But all of our art is created by our talented artists. We had no interest in replacing *any* developers with AI.” Solomon did not provide a reason for the studio’s closure.</p>

 <p>Studio closures and layoffs are arguably the games industry’s biggest crisis right now. Earlier today, <a href="https://kotaku.com/bluepoint-sony-playstation-ps5-god-war-2000671390">Sony announced it would close Bluepoint Games</a>, the studio behind the very well-received <em>Demon’s Souls</em> and <em>Shadow of the Colossus</em> remakes.&nbsp;In a 2024 interview with <em><a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/life-sim/xcom-designer-jake-solomon-is-done-with-turn-based-strategy-and-is-now-making-a-life-sim-inspired-by-the-small-town-drama-of-gilmore-girls/">PC Gamer</a></em>, Solomon said that Midsummer Studios had 11 employees, with plans to add two more. At the time of the studio’s creation, those included co-founder and <a href="https://kotaku.com/civilization-beyond-earth-the-kotaku-review-1649058397"><em>Sid Meier’s Civilization: Beyond Earth</em></a> designer Will Miller, and Grant Rodiek, a longtime designer on the<em>&nbsp;Sims</em> franchise. It seems likely that, with Midsummer’s closure and <em>Burbank</em>‘s cancelation, all of those employees will be out of a job.</p> <p>Still, Solomon tried to end the announcement on a positive note. “We have moments playing this game where characters come alive in a way we’ve never experienced. And for an old game developer like me that’s special. What you’re about to see is definitely pre-alpha. But this game was a dream of mine, our team made it come true, so watch and dream with us,” he wrote.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>In 2021, Facebook became Meta and the company claimed its <span data-start="12.945" data-end="13.235">focus</span>&nbsp;<span data-start="13.270" data-end="13.398">would</span>&nbsp;<span data-start="13.433" data-end="13.503">be</span>&nbsp;<span data-start="13.537" data-end="13.584">to</span> “<a href="https://about.fb.com/news/2021/10/facebook-company-is-now-meta/"><span data-start="13.653" data-end="13.874">bring</span>&nbsp;<span data-start="13.932" data-end="14.002">the</span>&nbsp;<span data-start="14.037" data-end="14.443">metaverse</span>&nbsp;<span data-start="14.478" data-end="14.547">to</span>&nbsp;</a><span data-start="14.629" data-end="15.012"><a href="https://about.fb.com/news/2021/10/facebook-company-is-now-meta/">life.</a>” It launched <em>Horizon Worlds,</em> a VR metaverse that people could explore and create worlds in. It looked bad and wasn’t great, but it was supposedly the future. Five years later, Meta’s metaverse is ditching VR and spinning <em>Worlds</em> into a Roblox clone after burning <a href="https://medium.com/analysts-corner/the-100-billion-metaverse-hallucination-6f036155a869">$70+ billion</a> on virtual and augmented reality.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><a href="https://developers.meta.com/horizon/blog/2026-vr-state-of-the-union-horizon-mobile-focus/">On February 19</a>, in a blog post on Meta’s official website, the company announced its plans to split its VR and Reality Labs sector from <a href="https://kotaku.com/facebook-metaverse-horizon-worlds-vr-oculus-quest-2-cha-1848436740"><em>Horizon Worlds</em>, its free-to-play 3D metaverse</a> that supports user-created worlds and games. The company claims that doing this will “create more space for both products to grow.” The plan now is to fully pivot <em>Worlds</em> into a mobile, non-VR software experience that will resemble a Roblox clone more than the virtual metaverse depicted in <em>Ready Player One.&nbsp;</em></p>

 <p>“We started <em>Worlds</em> for VR with a small crew of dedicated creators who set out to build immersive experiences on their own,” said Meta. “Last year, we began to experiment with <em>Worlds</em> as a mobile platform, and we saw positive momentum. Now, to truly change the game and tap into a much larger market, we’re going all-in on mobile.”</p>  <p>And when I say <em>Horizon Worlds</em> is becoming a Roblox clone, I mean that quite literally. In the blog post announcing this big shake-up, Meta name-drops three experiences that have landed on <em>Worlds</em> in recent months and become hugely popular:<em><a href="https://kotaku.com/grow-a-garden-roblox-5-million-active-users-record-pc-1851781824"> Grow A Garden</a>, Steal A Brainrot, </em>and <em>Yeet Yourself</em>. (Though oddly, after posting the blog, Meta removed the last two games. Hmm.)</p>

 <p>These are popular Roblox experiences, and it makes it clear what Meta is really doing with this pivot. Not many people wanted to strap a VR headset to their face to play bad games. But plenty of folks, including kids, are far more likely to hop into <em>Horizon Worlds</em> if it’s just a phone game they can hop into on a device they already own. Early testing proved that. When you consider that <a href="https://kotaku.com/why-the-video-game-industry-is-dying-2000671338">Roblox is one of the few parts of the game industry that is growing rapidly</a> and making tons of money, it makes sense that Meta would decide to take its bad VR Roblox clone, rip out the VR part, and hope to find success as a slop generator for kids.</p>

 <p>As for what this means for the future of virtual reality at Meta, the company claims it isn’t going anywhere. It says it has more VR hardware in development and plans to invest more in third-party VR devs. <a href="https://kotaku.com/meta-game-quest-vr-facebook-deadpool-sanzaru-twisted-pixel-layoffs-2000659376">But after the company sliced up its VR game studios last month</a>, well, it’s clear that if VR sticks around, it won’t be a main focus anymore at Meta. <a href="https://www.pymnts.com/meta/2025/meta-to-invest-600-billion-to-build-ai-data-centers-in-us/">Instead, the company is focused on AI. For now</a>.</p>
