              <p>Over five years after it was first announced, we’ve finally learned a lot more about the next entry in the <em>Fable</em> series. Get ready for a big open world filled with jobs, relationships, monsters, and more. And it arrives this Fall.</p> <p>This new spin on&nbsp;<em>Fable</em>, being developed by Playground Games—the same studio behind Xbox’s amazing<em>&nbsp;Forza Horizon</em>&nbsp;series—<a href="https://kotaku.com/xbox-is-bringing-back-fable-1844482199">was first announced back in 2020</a>&nbsp;and is being built&nbsp;<a href="https://kotaku.com/huh-the-new-fable-runs-on-the-forza-engine-1846833080">using the same tech</a> that powered those open-world driving games. And <em>Fable</em> sounds and looks impressive as seen in Xbox’s new Developer Direct.</p> <p>Playground Games says <em>Fable</em> will feature a fully seamless open world, a first for the series. You’ll be able explore every corner of Albion at your own pace without loading screens. Well, once you get through the game’s opening tutorial, where you start as a kid and have to watch your village be attacked. It is a <em>Fable</em> game, after all. It’s just tradition.</p>

  <p>During the Dev Direct, <a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2026/01/22/fable-interview-overview-details-developer-direct-2026/">Playground Games confirmed you’ll be able to customize your character’s face and clothing</a>. And like in past games, you can interact with villagers and NPCs, even marrying them or kicking them out of houses you own. Yes, you can be a fantasy landlord in <em>Fable</em>. The worst villain of all! Don’t worry, there are jobs that you can do to earn gold and of course, heroic quests to go on via the Hero’s Guild.</p> <p>Apparently, every NPC villager is unique and will react to your wealth, past actions, style, and more. Playground is also promising that the world will react to you in big and small ways. They list one example where a character who uses magic to get massive can be killed or reasoned with, and if you decide to end the giant’s life, his massive corpse will litter the world for the rest of the game. It will even, apparently, lower the property value of nearby homes.</p>

 <p>You won’t just be marrying people, buying houses, and being a terrible landlord. <em>Fable</em> will feature combat that looks similar to other third-person action RPGs. Expect to fight familiar foes, like Balverines&nbsp;and Hobbes, while out exploring Albion. And yes, morality is a big feature in this new reboot of the RPG series, letting you be evil or good.</p>

 <p>This all sounds wild, and looks nice thanks to Playground’s <em>Forza</em>-tech powering the fantasy open world. But I won’t really believe it works until I get my hands on the <em>Fable</em> this Fall when it launches on Xbox Series X/S, PS5, Game Pass, and PC. Though considering how many times it’s been delayed before, I’m also not convinced this RPG arrives before next year.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Sega and Ryu Ga Gotoku Studio recently released a new demo for<em> Yakuza 3 Kiwami,</em> an upcoming remake of the original PS3-era <em>Yakuza 3.</em> And a single alleyway in the demo has become the center of an online debate about whether<em> Yakuza 3 Kiwami</em> is a visual downgrade when compared to the OG game.</p> <p>On January 21, <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3948220/Yakuza_Kiwami_3__Dark_Ties_Demo/">Sega released a demo for <em>Yakuza 3 Kiwami</em> for PS5, Xbox Series X/S, Switch 2, and PC.</a> It didn’t take long after the demo’s launch for people to start complaining about the remake. Some aren’t happy that, like in the OG game, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/yakuzagames/comments/1qj4cdi/damn_kiwami_3_is_crazy_faithful_to_yakuza_3/">every character you fight is an expert at blocking.</a> Others claim that the remake’s map is smaller than the original’s and are unhappy about it. <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/news/2025/11/yakuza-3-remake-backlash-blows-up-again-as-actor-guilty-of-sexual-harassment-stars-in-new-trailer">There’s also the crappy decision by RGG to recast a character with actor Teruyuki Kagawa</a>, a man who has been accused of sexual assault against a hostess in 2019. While he apologized in 2022, people are still upset that he’s included in the remake. But the newest and biggest controversy surrounding <em>Kiwami 3</em> involves an alleyway found in the demo.</p>

 <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="zxx" dir="ltr"><a href="https://t.co/wj9u8chpW5">pic.twitter.com/wj9u8chpW5</a></p> <p>— Yakuza Spain 🐉 (@SpainYakuza) <a href="https://twitter.com/SpainYakuza/status/2014115748491252142?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 21, 2026</a></p></blockquote>  <p>On January 21, a user on Twitter shared a post comparing an alley in the OG <em>Yakuza 3</em> on PS3 with how it looks in the remake’s demo. While the original looks realistic and inviting, the remake’s version looks garish and ugly. However, the original account claimed that the rest of the demo looked better and was on par with recent RGG games. Another user pointed out that the alleyway looks fine when you aren’t inside of it, and <a href="https://x.com/Kami_No_Okami/status/2014382700677706178">someone else suggested it was tied to a technical issue involving the game’s lighting</a>. This is a problem that has plagued past <em>Yakuza/Like a Dragon</em> games, including <em>Pirates in Hawaii.&nbsp;</em></p> <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">Yakuza Kiwami 3 lighting issues are an auto-exposure bug.</p> <p>When in a dark area, the game brightens to make things easier to see, which overexposes bright areas and makes things look fullbright.</p> <p>The fix is as easy as disabling this, but Pirates in Hawaii had the same issue. <a href="https://t.co/hVu5OaUYzw">pic.twitter.com/hVu5OaUYzw</a></p> <p>— MeovvCAT (@osu_MeovvCAT) <a href="https://twitter.com/osu_MeovvCAT/status/2014364282725474705?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 22, 2026</a></p></blockquote>  <p>That information didn’t stop the original post comparing the old and new game from going viral online, <a href="https://x.com/kitsuneredFES/status/2014250516977492350">leading to more people sharing footage</a> and <a href="https://x.com/exblackwater/status/2014149801554633074">screenshots of the ugly alleyway</a> on <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/kano01.bsky.social/post/3mcyuyh2ylk25">social media sites like Twitter and BlueSky</a> as well as Reddit.</p>

 <p>Thankfully, the playerbase is already fixing the ugly lighting issues in <em>Yakuza 3 Kiwami</em>. <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/yakuzakiwami3/mods/16">There’s already a mod</a> for the demo online that <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/yakuzagames/comments/1qjuwsf/a_quick_original_filter_vs_no_filter_comparison/">apparently removes a visual filter RGG has implemented in the game and in other recent <em>Yakuza</em> titles.</a> And yeah, seeing the game both with and without the filter makes it clear that this isn’t an ugly game. Instead, it seems that the filter, as well as some shading issues, are causing it to look worse than the OG <em>Yakuza 3</em> in some specific circumstances. Hopefully the devs add a toggle to remove the filter, but considering they are shipping <em>Kiwami 3</em> with an actor who allegedly sexually assaulted a woman, I’m not going to hold my breath.</p>
