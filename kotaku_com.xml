It’s a fan-favorite due to its highly viable minion builds that sprint through zones, clearing mobs with reckless abandon. But for a new player, making it to the end-game with the Witch means picking the right starting skills—a strong foundation. Let’s go over what that foundation looks like and what your best options are when starting out as a Witch. I wish I had taken these skills for the Witch in <em>Path of Exile 2</em> on my first playthrough.</p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="195734" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="The Week In Games: What’s Coming Out Beyond Cyberpunk 2077: Phantom Liberty" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="157" data-playlist="195734,196411,195189" data-current="195734"><div><p>The Week In Games: What’s Coming Out Beyond Cyberpunk 2077: Phantom Liberty</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195734/195734_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195734/195734_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195734/195734_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195734/195734_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/21246.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><h2 id="h7995"><a id="active"></a>The best Witch early-game skills to snag<br></h2><p>In <em>Path of Exile 2</em>, the skills you’ll unlock for your class range from Tier 1 to Tier 13, albeit skipping a few in between. Let’s focus on Tiers 1, 3, and 5, which will provide you with an early-game foundation toward success.</p><h3 id="h7996"><a id=""></a><strong>Tier I: Skeletal Sniper</strong></h3><figure id="" data-id="f2348af7cf3439e730225ec41f75ea04" data-recommend-id="image://f2348af7cf3439e730225ec41f75ea04" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A menu screen shows the Skeletal Sniper skill in Path of Exile 2." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A menu screen shows the Skeletal Sniper skill in Path of Exile 2." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Grinding Gear Games / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="f2348af7cf3439e730225ec41f75ea04" data-recommend-id="image://f2348af7cf3439e730225ec41f75ea04" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A menu screen shows the Skeletal Sniper skill in Path of Exile 2." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p><strong>Unearth </strong>is a relatively basic-yet-functional AoE (area-of-effect) skill that is completely free during the prologue section on the beach. But if you want to enhance your area damage, choose <strong>Skeletal Sniper</strong> as your Tier I skill. This is a powerful minion spell that summons a skeleton archer wielding a poison gas bow and arrow.</p><h3 id="h7997"><a id=""></a><strong>Tier III: Skeletal Arsonist</strong></h3><figure id="" data-id="a935b6192025191c7db79f6cbd362f21" data-recommend-id="image://a935b6192025191c7db79f6cbd362f21" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A menu shows the Skeletal Arsonist skill in Path of Exile 2." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A menu shows the Skeletal Arsonist skill in Path of Exile 2." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Grinding Gear Games / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="a935b6192025191c7db79f6cbd362f21" data-recommend-id="image://a935b6192025191c7db79f6cbd362f21" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A menu shows the Skeletal Arsonist skill in Path of Exile 2." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Keeping up with the AoE theme, your second ability (this one for Tier 3), should be <strong>Skeletal Arsonist</strong>. This is another minion summon spell that spawns a group of bomb-throwing skeletons to wreak havoc on a given area. It’s exceptional for controlling an arena, like during one of the game’s many optional boss fights.</p><h3 id="h7998"><a id=""></a><strong>Tier V: Raise Zombie</strong></h3><figure id="" data-id="caf93c203e684679d1b956ad6f328c4c" data-recommend-id="image://caf93c203e684679d1b956ad6f328c4c" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A menu screen shows the Raise Zombie skill." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A menu screen shows the Raise Zombie skill." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Grinding Gear Games / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="caf93c203e684679d1b956ad6f328c4c" data-recommend-id="image://caf93c203e684679d1b956ad6f328c4c" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A menu screen shows the Raise Zombie skill." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Lastly, for Tier 5, consider<strong> Raise Zombie</strong>. It is, as expected, another minion summon spell, just one that’s on a short timer. You can raise up to 10 zombies, creating a horde of minions that lash out at enemies who come too close. With Raise Zombie and your Skeletal spawning skills, you’ll have a small, undead force to rampage through a map.</p><h2 id="h7999"><a id="passive"></a>Best passive skills for the Witch<br></h2><figure id="" data-id="ae307356176271e58c922cdf51c3f050" data-recommend-id="image://ae307356176271e58c922cdf51c3f050" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A screenshot shows the passive skill tree for the witch.

" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>As should be obvious by now, the foundation we just discussed will lead you on to a heavy summons build in <em>Path of Exile 2</em>. As a new player, you may quickly feel overwhelmed by the passive skill tree, but it’s less intimidating than it appears. This is the passive skill tree for all classes, so you don’t have to worry about most of the tree, just your section where the game starts.</p><p>With that said, first, focus on the left-hand path, which<strong> increases</strong> <strong>Spell and Minion Damage</strong>. While it may change during Early Access, the first node provides a noticeable boost in your damage output,<strong> increasing Spell Damage by 8 percent and Minion Damage by 8 percent</strong>.</p><p>You should follow this path of the tree for a short while, then refocus your efforts on the right-hand node path, which will increase survivability. You’ll be a glass cannon initially, but it’s worthwhile to increase the power of your summons, which will handle the brunt of the work.</p><p>Of course, if you prefer a more tactical approach, the <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/path-of-exile-2-mercenary-class-guide-beginners-best-1851721613&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/path-of-exile-2-mercenary-class-guide-beginners-best-1851721613">new Mercenary class is considered one of the best in <em>Path of Exile 2</em> Early Access</a></span>! You can play<em> Path of Exile 2</em> now on PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series X/S, so long as you purchase a supporter’s pack.</p><p>.<br></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Set in the Tamriel province of Cyrodiil, the RPG tasks the player with preventing an evil cult from opening up a portal to hell.

According to her, <em>Your Friendly Neighborhood Spider-Man </em>begins with Peter Parker entering his freshman year of high school, which sets it apart from the live-action Tom Holland film franchise that starts with Parker in his sophomore year. However, the animated series does follow some of the same timeline as Holland’s films as the show is “starting at a point in the MCU where Civil War has happened, so the Sokovia Accords have been ratified.” <br></p><p>At a certain point, though, it sounds as if things break off from the chronology we’re familiar with due to some kind of inciting incident. According to Vasquez-Eberhardt, during Parker’s first day at school “a thing happens that—and there goes your branch.” From then on, <em>Your Friendly Neighborhood Spider-Man </em>charts its own path. It’ll be one without Parker ever going to Midtown Technical High School, or meeting Ned and MJ. Before you cry foul, Vasquez-Eberhardt promises this divergence from the typical Spidey arc allows the show to delve into some intriguing ensemble pairings with Spider-Man.

Well, years ago Valve implemented cool stuff like Steam achievements, game cards, and badges. These are great features that incentivize people to play and buy more games. However, not long after these features were added to Steam, some shady devs started creating very basic “games” that were just designed to pad achievements, give players cheap cards to trade, and increase their collection stats. So Valve came up with a solution to stop that stuff. </p><p> <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://partner.steamgames.com/doc/marketing/profile&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://partner.steamgames.com/doc/marketing/profile" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">As explained by Valve via its Steam documentation website,</a></span> games arrive on Steam “limited” and missing features like trading cards. Only games that meet a certain (undisclosed) popularity and sales threshold are able to escape this limited status. The idea is that this is a quality check against shovelware and scams. And if you’re curious how many games released on Steam in 2024 are limited, well, the answer is <em>a lot</em>. </p><p>Over on LinkedIn, Twitch’s head of games Bill Young <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.linkedin.com/posts/youngbill_19k-games-were-published-on-steam-in-2024-activity-7283203637084876801-IMZx/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/youngbill_19k-games-were-published-on-steam-in-2024-activity-7283203637084876801-IMZx/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">posted an interesting breakdown</a></span> of how the majority of video game releasing on Steam these days are limited. According to SteamDB, in <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://steamdb.info/stats/releases/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://steamdb.info/stats/releases/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">2024 18,992 games were released on Steam</a></span>. But only <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://steamdb.info/stats/releases/?tagid=1003823&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://steamdb.info/stats/releases/?tagid=1003823" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">4,041 of those games</a></span> racked up enough sales and attracted enough players to escape limited status. That means 14,951 games launched last year on Valve’s digital PC storefront were barely played or purchased. </p><p> That 14,951 works out to 79% of all games released on Steam in 2024. And this isn’t a new trend, as pointed out by Young. In 2020, 66 percent of all games launched on Steam were limited. In 2022, that number reached 72 percent. And now, it’s up to nearly 80 percent. If you’re curious about how 2025 is going to shake out, well, we’re only 13 days into the year and 444 games have already released on Steam. 389 of them are limited.</p><p>Some might argue that Valve shouldn’t throttle or limit any of these games. But the reality is that we would likely see an increase in shovelware, scams, and asset flips if Valve completely took down the barriers it currently has in place. And I don’t think the world needs 200,000 random games suddenly flooding Steam. </p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
