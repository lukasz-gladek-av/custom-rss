If you place one just right, it’s possible to walk through the portal into inaccessible rooms. As such, if you can get an opposing player to walk through, you can trap them outside the bounds of the usual game space. This is an effective way to get people off an objective, sure, but when it becomes clear there’s no way out they’ll likely either leave the game or get disconnected due to inactivity. Which isn’t much fun. But it’s so much worse than that! Some players are developing a whole strategy around this, combining it with <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/marvel-rivals-jeff-the-land-shark-ultimate-ability-1851716962&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/marvel-rivals-jeff-the-land-shark-ultimate-ability-1851716962">Jeff the Land Shark’s ultimate</a></span> and spitting enemies into the dodgy portals like they’re being thrown into a prison.</p><p><em>Marvel Rivals </em>streamer Jay3 showcased the strategy on his channel, and it’s diabolical. The Doctor Strange player places one portal inside a wall, while putting the other under Jeff. The little land shark devours his enemies, and instead of spitting them off the side of the map like most players do, he shoots them through the portal and into the inaccessible area. Normally, the portal would linger a little bit longer and players would be able to jump back through, but the strategy here is to have the Doctor Strange player swap heroes immediately after creating the portal, causing it to disappear from the map.</p><p>This is the kind of oversight a developer would easily miss during testing, and is only found when a game is in the hands of mischievous players. Hopefully, developer NetEase nips this in the bud before it becomes too widespread, as players being booted from matches is never a good goal.</p><p><em>Marvel Rivals </em>just <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/marvel-rivals-frost-ultron-characters-xmen-season-2-1851774548&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/marvel-rivals-frost-ultron-characters-xmen-season-2-1851774548">entered its second season</a></span>, which adds Emma Frost and Ultron to the roster.

Though the movie wasn’t a huge success at the box office, it managed to gain a cult following after it was released on VHS. To celebrate the anniversary, Disney has released a documentary on the making of the movie, <em>Not Just A Goof</em>,<em> </em>on Disney+, and also put out a lo-fi ambiance video of Max studying that you can listen to while you study or work. I’ve got it open in my browser now, and maybe there is something to these videos. This is a vibe.</p><p>While the comments are turned off on the video itself, if you look around social media platforms like TikTok and X (formerly Twitter), you’ll find eagle-eyed <em>Kingdom Hearts </em>fans yapping about a few things on and around Max’s desk.

It’s an uplifting, gentle tale, packed with superbly informed references to Arthur Conan Doyle’s fiction, delivered with a bucolic charm.</p><p>Beginning during the conclusion of <em>The Adventure of the Three Garridebs</em>, in which Watson is superficially wounded by a gunshot, we are soon in the famous rooms at 22B Baker Street, with Holmes trying to find the right words to tell Watson something important. In a densely packed room filled with objects to look at, use, pick up, and even talk to, the opening moments are all about procrastination, Holmes resorting to habit, deducing banalities as he delays informing Watson of his intention to retire.</p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="197527" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="Lost Records: Bloom &amp; Rage Part 2 Is Short, Shocking, And Strangely Satisfying" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="169" data-playlist="197527,197525,197298" data-current="197527"><div><p>Lost Records: Bloom &amp; Rage Part 2 Is Short, Shocking, And Strangely Satisfying</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197527/197527_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197527/197527_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197527/197527_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/23057.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div><h4><strong>Buried Treasure Indie Game Reviews</strong></h4><p>  <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://buried-treasure.org/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://buried-treasure.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>Buried Treasure</em></a></span><em> is a site that hunts for excellent unknown games that aren’t getting noticed elsewhere.

That’s something Doyle wrote about in <em>The Adventure of the Lion’s Mane</em>, one of only two stories narrated by Holmes himself, and not featuring Watson at all. This isn’t the last Holmes story however, with <em>His Last Bow</em> telling of Holmes and Watson’s spy-based adventures at the beginning of the First World War, but it suggests how Holmes intends to spend the remainder of his life. Enter <em>The Beekeeper’s Picnic</em>.</p><p>It’s now 1918 and Watson has just returned from the war, where he was serving as a medic on the front lines. Holmes is implied to have continued his work for the British government throughout the Great War, but is now back in his retirement village of Fulworth. He lives with his new housekeeper, the rather fearsome Martha, in the tiny town filled with recognizable references to <em>The Lion’s Mane</em>, like local school The Gables and its headmaster, the affable Harold Stackhurst. Watson has come to stay, and Holmes is greatly relieved to see him. In the years that have passed, as Holmes has aged, he’s begun to regret more and more how he treated Watson throughout their lives, and he seems determined to make efforts to put this right. Primary among them on this day is to organize Watson a picnic, so the two can enjoy some quiet, comfortable time together.</p><figure id="" data-id="052d54fdd90e528522f1c5fc61dcf3b3" data-recommend-id="image://052d54fdd90e528522f1c5fc61dcf3b3" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A con artist draws a crowd on the beach, and lies about her qualifications." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A con artist draws a crowd on the beach, and lies about her qualifications." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Afoot Games / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="052d54fdd90e528522f1c5fc61dcf3b3" data-recommend-id="image://052d54fdd90e528522f1c5fc61dcf3b3" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A con artist draws a crowd on the beach, and lies about her qualifications." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>To achieve this, Holmes needs to do all sorts of point-and-click adventure things, like win the best honey contest at the village fete, and find a missing cat in pursuit of some elderflower cordial. Holmes also has his “brain-attic,” where he can pair deductions together on an imagined blackboard, and muse on all the characters in his lives. And as he does, he inevitably stumbles upon a little case: the disappearance of some valuable taxidermized animals from a London museum seems to have some ties to events in the village. What’s so joyful here is that all these puzzles, no matter how contrived they may sound, are all entirely focused on relationships with people. This is a Holmes for whom the feelings of others have finally become relevant, and while he’s unquestionably the same incorrigible master detective, he would rather focus his efforts toward supporting the impetuous actions of children than catching nefarious criminals.</p><p>In fact, should you choose, you can invite Watson to the picnic at the very beginning of the main game, and ignore everything else. It won’t go well–the beach below will be unpleasantly noisy, with the crowds gathered to see the purported “mermaid” a shyster claims to have discovered, and there won’t be any food or drink, but the credits will still roll. You can also focus entirely on the picnic, ignoring the various other little stories there are to discover, and it will go to plan…it’s just that Watson won’t praise you for all the differences you made to people you encountered, some of which can be quite moving.</p><figure id="" data-id="ab195abd130dd0c09f920bb44498477a" data-recommend-id="image://ab195abd130dd0c09f920bb44498477a" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Afoot Games / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="ab195abd130dd0c09f920bb44498477a" data-recommend-id="image://ab195abd130dd0c09f920bb44498477a" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>What I’m skirting around here, as does Holmes, is the nature of the relationship between the pair. While people have shipped Holmes and Watson forever, I’ve so often found this crude, and to miss so much of the point. More than anything else, it fails to recognize Holmes as a man entirely incapable of sustaining a meaningful relationship with <em>anyone at all</em>, such is the nature of his pathology and self-interest. <em>The Beekeeper’s Picnic</em>, however, earns the right to probe this territory and suggest that things may have changed, given the many years that have now passed, the effects of the war on both men, and the results of Holmes’ years spent in quiet reflection.</p><p>Choosing to start with the denouement of <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://gutenberg.org/cache/epub/69700/pg69700-images.html&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://gutenberg.org/cache/epub/69700/pg69700-images.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>The Three Garridebs</em></a></span> is incredibly smart, because it’s really the first time Doyle allowed Holmes to soften enough that Watson would be able to perceive some depth of feeling, before Holmes resets to form in the next story. Facing off against Killer Evans, Watson is shot, and Holmes immediately thumps Evans on the head with his pistol. Holmes checks Evans’ body for more weapons, then guides Watson to a chair while exclaiming,</p><blockquote data-type="BlockQuote"><p>“You’re not hurt, Watson? For God’s sake, say that you are not hurt!”</p></blockquote><p>Watson’s narration then continues,</p><blockquote data-type="BlockQuote"><p>It was worth a wound—it was worth many wounds—to know the depth of loyalty and love which lay behind that cold mask. The clear, hard eyes were dimmed for a moment, and the firm lips were shaking. For the one and only time I caught a glimpse of a great heart as well as of a great brain. All my years of humble but single-minded service culminated in that moment of revelation.</p></blockquote><p>It’s within this framing that the game is set, with Holmes’ love for Watson an unanswered question. Even at the start, when Holmes is trying to find the way to tell Watson he intends to retire, the scene burns with a deeper burden he wishes he could share. It’s made very clear once we’re in 1918 that Holmes deeply regrets not saying more, and sees the picnic as a chance to make that right. But, crucially, what that love and relationship looks like is <em>not</em> determined by this narrative–it is up to you, and how you see their connection, and in the game’s final moments there’s no forced imposition of romance. I’ll leave you to discover all the possibilities.</p><figure id="" data-id="51f9ca2bc6ceeaff5bbd3f7b0fb963e7" data-recommend-id="image://51f9ca2bc6ceeaff5bbd3f7b0fb963e7" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Afoot Games / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="51f9ca2bc6ceeaff5bbd3f7b0fb963e7" data-recommend-id="image://51f9ca2bc6ceeaff5bbd3f7b0fb963e7" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>What results is a deeply humble love story, and the nature of that love, whether agape, eros or phllia, is your choice, and really not more important than the existence of that love in any form.</p><p>It certainly helps that the performances here are extraordinary. British actors James Quinn and Andrew James Spooner play Holmes and Watson respectively, both with an incredible calm and gentleness. Both characters have been rendered by popular culture as such caricatures that they’re often portrayed as gurning eccentrics, but not here at all. Both are restrained, their performances tinged with a melancholy, and helped greatly because <em>for once</em> a game has cast older actors to play older characters.</p><p>They’re not alone. I am astonished by the cast here, given this is an obscure indie adventure drawn in (beautiful, superbly animated) crude pixel graphics, that has not received a single review from the gaming press. Mycroft, who appears as the greatest in-game hint system in gaming history (you can telephone him at the Diogenes for a conversation, and ask for his thoughts on unfinished matters) is played by <em>Game of Thrones’</em> Maester Wolkan, Richard Rycroft. One minor character, Mrs. Whitlock, is voiced by Alison Skillbeck, an actor with credits going back to 1976, most recently appearing in <em>The Crown</em>. Enormous credit must go to <em>Wooden Overcoats</em>‘ Felix Trench, who plays the game’s most poignant character in a side-story that can be completely missed, but which is heartbreaking and can end beautifully.</p><figure id="" data-id="ddba1384ee12641db149bab0a642c472" data-recommend-id="image://ddba1384ee12641db149bab0a642c472" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Afoot Games / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="ddba1384ee12641db149bab0a642c472" data-recommend-id="image://ddba1384ee12641db149bab0a642c472" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>This game is such a total delight. It’s warm, meaningful, and packed with whimsy. (Toby III, Holmes’ new pet dog, can talk, although of course no humans can understand him. A stuffed bear in the background of one small scene can be talked to, too, for a lovely little extra.) Exploring the love between Holmes and Watson could have been <em>so</em> clumsy, but not a foot is put wrong, and the result is so heartwarming and truthful.</p><p>I don’t know how this game came to exist, nor how it has gone so completely under the radar. This is, improbably, primarily the work of one person–Helen Greetham. She has written, programmed, and drawn the entire game, and I think legitimately added to the Holmesian canon in a way so much of the post-copyright contributions fail to achieve. This is my perfect ending to the tales of Holmes and Watson, and I’m so delighted to have played it.</p><p><em>You can buy </em>The Beekeeper’s Picnic<em> from </em><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://jabbage.itch.io/the-beekeepers-picnic-poc&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://jabbage.itch.io/the-beekeepers-picnic-poc" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>Itch</em></a></span><em> or </em><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://store.steampowered.com/app/2248890/The_Beekeepers_Picnic__A_Sherlockian_Adventure/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2248890/The_Beekeepers_Picnic__A_Sherlockian_Adventure/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>Steam</em></a></span><em> for $14.</em></p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
