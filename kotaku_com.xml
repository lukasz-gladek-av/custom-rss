Given the two games are likely to be launching reasonably close together, and will be frantically competing for the same audience, it’d be madness to deliberately out-price the rival. However, Wilson said on the call that $80 prices hadn’t been factored into any of EA’s projected earnings through March 2026. Now, that could be because the company wanted to low-ball and report unexpected profits, or it could always have been planning to release <em>BF6</em> at the previous upper price.</p><p>Of course, when pre-orders are announced there will inevitably be ways to spend <em>vastly</em> more than $70 on <em>Battlefield 6</em>, with ludicrous bundles offering imaginary doodads and different dress-up options for your soldiers for possibly hundreds of dollars. Seventy will get you the very basic version of the game, without a season pass, DLC, etc, and it’ll make sure to let you know what a pedestrian person you are as you choose it. Fortunately, there’s the far smarter option of never pre-ordering anything, because <em>it’s a scam</em>.</p><p>.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://kotaku.com/battlefield-6-price-70-80-ea-preorder-black-ops-7-1851787292]]></content:encoded>

However, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c4gzmkjjj03o&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c4gzmkjjj03o" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">we are in the remarkably fortunate situation</a></span> where—so far at least—there has been no loss of life, nor any significant reports of harm. It’s still possible that large waves could affect a huge number of countries, as far afield as China, New Zealand and Peru, and 13-foot waves have affected parts of Russia. However, even tsunamis have, so far, been minor. Despite this, evacuations are vital, with reports that waves <em>could</em> reach 10 feet in Japan. As such, <em>Elden Ring</em> developers FromSoftware have left their offices and canceled July 31's planned release of Patch 1.02.</p><p>“Due to the tsunami warning following the earthquake near the Kamchatka Peninsula,” reads FromSoft’s statement, “we have decided to postpone the distribution of the ‘<em>ELDEN RING NIGHTREIGN</em>’ Patch 1.02, which was scheduled for today to tomorrow, July 31 (Thursday) after 10:00CEST / 1:00 PDT.”</p><p>Duo Mode was due to add the ability to play <em>Nightreign</em> in pairs, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/elden-ring-nightreign-duos-mode-option-patch-1-02-ps5-1851786981&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/elden-ring-nightreign-duos-mode-option-patch-1-02-ps5-1851786981">a feature fans have been begging for since the game’s release</a></span>. The game was launched designed to be played in groups of three, which is an unusual group size for multiplayer gaming, and clearly far harder to pull together than just partnering up. The lack of a two-player mode felt even more strange, though, given you could also play solo. Two days after the game came out, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/elden-ring-nightreign-duos-mod-seamless-coop-pc-1851783200&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/elden-ring-nightreign-duos-mod-seamless-coop-pc-1851783200">a modder created an unofficial two-player option</a></span>, demonstrating it was certainly possible. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.ign.com/articles/elden-ring-nightreign-director-says-duos-were-kind-of-overlooked-and-neglected-as-main-focus-was-on-3-players&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/elden-ring-nightreign-director-says-duos-were-kind-of-overlooked-and-neglected-as-main-focus-was-on-3-players" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">FromSoftware said at the time</a></span> that not including duos was rather oddly “overlooked during development,” and that the game had only been balanced for three-player play. That was due to change over the next couple of days.</p><p>Patch 1.02 was also going to launch alongside the addition of a second group of the more difficult Everdark Sovereign bosses, with Maris “Augur” Fathom of Night due to be first. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/elden-ring-nightreign-augur-evergaol-everdark-time-1851787245?_gl=1*2c3yjo*_ga*Nzg4NTQ4NDM0LjE2MjQwMjI5MDc.*_ga_V4QNJTT5L0*czE3NTM3ODEwNzckbzI3JGcxJHQxNzUzODcwODY5JGoxMCRsMCRoMA..&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/elden-ring-nightreign-augur-evergaol-everdark-time-1851787245?_gl=1*2c3yjo*_ga*Nzg4NTQ4NDM0LjE2MjQwMjI5MDc.*_ga_V4QNJTT5L0*czE3NTM3ODEwNzckbzI3JGcxJHQxNzUzODcwODY5JGoxMCRsMCRoMA..">As Ethan said yesterday</a></span>, what was one of the easier fights in <em>Elden Ring</em> is due to become one of the toughest bosses you can take on in <em>Nightreign</em>, but again, we’ll now have to wait a bit longer to experience this new encounter.</p><p>Obviously there’s no word yet on when the patch will now arrive. FromSoftware are doing the smart thing and keeping themselves safe. That’s clearly the priority far above rolling out a patch, and we wish everyone the very best.</p><p>Same to anyone near a coast in the vast affected portions of Earth today. Stay safe, listen to evacuation orders, and worry about video games later.</p><p>.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://kotaku.com/elden-ring-nightreign-patch-duo-mode-delay-earthquake-1851787291]]></content:encoded>
