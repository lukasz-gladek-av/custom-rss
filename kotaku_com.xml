              <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/anthem-server-shutdown-final-hours-videos-clips-stream-2000659367"><i><span>Anthem</span></i><span>’s servers have been shut down</span></a><span> for a week now, marking the end of a pretty tragic chapter in developer BioWare’s history. The live-service looter shooter’s crash and burn reportedly nudged publisher EA to let the studio strip out the reported multiplayer elements from the game that would go on to become </span><i><span>Dragon Age: The Veilguard</span></i><span>, which signaled to some that the studio was “returning” to its roots. However, as </span><i><span>Anthem</span></i><span> has been dropped down into an abyss, ex-BioWare producer Mark Darrah is disputing the notion that the game was </span><i><span>that</span></i><span> far out of left field for the studio.</span></p> <p><span>In an interview with </span><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Y65eoBVF0Y"><span>YouTuber Destin Legarie</span></a><span>, Darrah talked at length about the life and death of </span><i><span>Anthem</span></i><span>, and in the closing minutes, Legarie asks if there’s anything Darrah wants to “set the record straight” on regarding the game. Darrah replies that while many people want to point fingers solely at EA for mandating that the historically single-player RPG studio shift into making an ill-advised cooperative loot shooter, it wasn’t “all their fault.” He also said that, at the time, the prospect of making </span><i><span>Anthem </span></i><span>seemed like just the latest evolution for a studio that had evolved many times before, so he says he is less swayed by arguments stating that the company shouldn’t have even tried.</span></p>

  <p><span>“My feeling is that BioWare has always been changing,” he said. “I mean, by that argument, we should never have made </span><i><span>Neverwinter Nights</span></i><span> because we were a 2D RPG maker. We should never have made </span><i><span>Mass Effect</span></i><span> because we were a tactical RPG maker, not an action RPG maker. So I don’t know that that argument holds a lot of weight for me. To me, it’s like, yeah, your studios evolve, and they try new things, and was </span><i><span>Anthem</span></i><span> too big of a reach? Yeah, for sure. But could you tell at the time? I don’t know. I don’t know that you could.”</span></p> <p><span>In a perfect world, developers would be able to make mistakes like </span><i><span>Anthem </span></i><span>without risking going under, but reports about </span><i><span>Anthem</span></i><span>’s development indicate that it did some seismic damage to BioWare </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/dragon-age-the-veilguard-bioware-layoffs-mass-effect-1851784416"><span>internally that it’s still recovering from</span></a><span>. The company was </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/mass-effect-5-bioware-dragon-age-veilguard-dlc-layoffs-1851750767"><span>downsized last year</span></a><span> as a small team works on the next </span><i><span>Mass Effect </span></i><span>game. We’ll see if it’s enough to get the studio back on track after a decade of strife.</span></p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/life-is-strange-reunion-chloe-announcement-release-date-2000661323</link>
            <guid>1411138</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/life-is-strange-5-reunion-chloe-max-summary-plot-leak-2000658198">The rumors were true</a>. <em>Life Is Strange: Reunion</em> is coming, and it’s bringing Chloe Price back into the fold after 2024’s <em>Double Exposure&nbsp;</em>hinted at her return. Perhaps most surprisingly, however, it’s coming out in just two months.</p> <p>The official announcement is <a href="https://x.com/LifeIsStrange/status/2011829955592585531?s=20">set to go live at 1 p.m. Eastern</a>, but Xbox Wire posted <a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2026/01/20/life-is-strange-reunion-reveal/">its announcement blog a bit early</a>.&nbsp;<em>Reunion&nbsp;</em>will star both Max Caulfield and Chloe as co-protagonists, with both having different gameplay mechanics. Max is able to rewind time as she did in the first&nbsp;<em>Life Is Strange</em>, while Chloe will use her argumentative “Backtalk” mechanic from the prequel&nbsp;<em>Before the Storm</em>.</p>

 <p>The big question is how Chloe is able to return despite her possibly dying at the end of the original&nbsp;<em>Life Is Strange</em>, a choice that&nbsp;<em>Double Exposure&nbsp;</em>made a point to import. Based on this line in the blog post, it seems like it may be as a result of the timeline jumping Max did in&nbsp;<em>Double Exposure</em>, though I expect the minutiae of this to be affected by which choice you made way back in 2015.</p> <blockquote><p>Chloe’s return may be due to Max’s power, in particular, the power Max gained in <em>Life is Strange: Double Exposure</em>&nbsp;to Shift between parallel timelines — a power Max subsequently lost when she merged those timelines back together and recovered her ability to Rewind.</p></blockquote> <p>Whatever the case, it does seem like&nbsp;<em>Reunion</em> is not undoing either choice, as the blog says “Whether Chloe lived or died in Arcadia Bay, and whether she and Max were friends or lovers — these choices are key not just to the&nbsp;<em>past</em>&nbsp;you’ll confirm as you play, but to the&nbsp;<em>future&nbsp;</em>you’ll fight for the chance to build.” So I will hold judgement for the time being, and I won’t have to wait long, as&nbsp;<em>Reunion</em> is coming to PC, PS5, and Xbox Series X/S on March 27.</p>

  <p><b data-stringify-type="bold">Update: 1/20/26, 1:00 p.m. ET:&nbsp;</b>Alright now that the actual announcement livestream is up, we know how the game will handle both endings.</p> <h2>How&nbsp;<em>Reunion&nbsp;</em>handles both&nbsp;<em>Life Is Strange</em> endings</h2> <p>As expected, Max’s merging of the timelines at the end of&nbsp;<em>Double Exposure</em> is at the heart of Chloe’s appearance. Rhianna DeVries, who voiced the character in&nbsp;<em>Before the Storm</em>, is reprising the role in&nbsp;<em>Reunion</em>, and the version of her we meet seems to have contradictory memories from both timelines. Though where she truly originates from will seemingly be affected by the decision you made at the end of&nbsp;<em>Life Is Strange</em>. You can see an example of two exchanges between Max and Chloe that play out differently depending on which choice you made at the 37-minute mark of the reveal stream above.</p>

              <p>Nintendo presidents past and present are in the news this week. One of 2025’s biggest blockbusters might finally have a Switch 2 release date again. And if you bought <em>Oblivion Remastered</em> and barely played it, you’re hardly alone. It’s the latest edition of Morning Checkpoint, <em>Kotaku</em>‘s daily roundup of gaming news, rumors, and culture.</p> <p>It’s currently <a href="https://kotaku.com/reviews/backlog">Backlog Week around these parts</a>. I spent the Martin Luther King Jr. holiday weekend playing a ridiculous amount of <a href="https://kotaku.com/xbox-game-pass-october-november-2025-powerwash-sim-2-2000638198"><em>Dome Keeper</em></a> with my kids. It came to Game Pass recently and is a clever little roguelite tower defense game that’s surprisingly hard to put down. The winter doldrums are ending this week, though. Lots of fresh 2026 releases are just around the corner.</p>

 <h2><em>Borderlands 4</em> seems slated to finally release on Switch 2 in February</h2> <p>A store listing on Portuguese site <em><a href="https://www.gamingreplay.com/pt/pre-reservas-nintendo-switch-2/32061-borderlands-4-game-key-card-switch-2-5026555072694.html">GamingReplay</a></em> (via <a href="https://www.thegamer.com/borderlands-4-switch-2-release-date/"><em>TheGamer</em></a>) states a release date of February 27, 2026 for the sci-fi sequel. That’s a Thursday, so that tracks. It also puts it after a potential February Nintendo Direct to perhaps remind everyone it’s still coming. The port was <a href="https://kotaku.com/borderlands-4-switch-2-delay-cross-save-performance-2000628055">indefinitely delayed</a> last fall as Gearbox Entertainment addressed performance issues with the PC version of the loot shooter.</p> <h2>It’s a good thing<em> The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion Remastered</em> didn’t charge by gameplay minute actually completed</h2> <p>Alinea Analytics’ <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/rhyselliott_my-ps5s-an-xbox-now-apparently-earlier-share-7417556440577470464-cl55/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Rhys Elliot recently pointed out</a> (via <a href="https://frvr.com/blog/the-elder-scrolls-iv-oblivion-remastered-sold-just-over-a-million-copies-on-ps5-but-50-of-gamers-played-just-15-hours-before-quitting/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>FRVR</em></a>) that while <em>Oblivion Remastered</em> sold over 1 million copies on PS5, about half of those buyers played less than 15 hours of the sprawling RPG. The Steam data is similarly stark. <a href="https://www.thegamer.com/oblivion-remastered-ps5-half-players-15-hours/">Per <em>TheGamer</em></a>, only 55 percent of PC players got the game’s first story quest achievement, only 11 percent entered the Shivering Isles, and only 7.5 percent completed the main quest.</p>

 <h2><em>Divinity: Original Sin 2</em> just had its best sales month in over 8 years</h2> <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">Sales for both BG3 and D:OS 2 have been incredible since the announcement of  Divinity. </p> <p>D:OS 2 really surprised us by having its best month since release in 2017.  Wish I’d removed the squirrel in time 🙂 <a href="https://t.co/fXTEUtuS7r">https://t.co/fXTEUtuS7r</a></p> <p>— Swen Vincke @where? (@LarAtLarian) <a href="https://twitter.com/LarAtLarian/status/2013481225030094906?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 20, 2026</a></p></blockquote>  <p>The announcement of <em>Divinity</em> in December spurred players to return to both<em> Baldur’s Gate 3</em> and the 2017 RPG. No doubt part of that was a big Switch 2 upgrade and a half-off sale.</p>

 <h2><em>World of Warcraft</em> veteran will work on Riot’s MMO</h2> <p>Blizzard producer Raymond Bartos has joined Riot Games (via <a href="https://massivelyop.com/2026/01/19/riot-games-unnamed-mmorpg-project-picks-up-a-former-world-of-warcraft-producer/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-cy="styled-link"><em>MassivelyOP</em></a>). “I’m incredibly excited to be joining Riot on the MMO team!!!” he posted. “I’m deeply grateful for the opportunity to join such an inspiring group of people, and I can’t wait to get started — showing up every day to provide value for Riot gamers and help deliver an MMO experience players truly enjoy.” He’ll be back with past collaborator Orlando Salvatore and said he thinks the team will be “moving fast on day one.”</p> <h2>New <em>Fable</em> art work has surfaced</h2> <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">Fable | Concept Art<a href="https://t.co/OuQzqybQut">https://t.co/OuQzqybQut</a> <a href="https://t.co/ci23N0n0xW">pic.twitter.com/ci23N0n0xW</a></p> <p>— Klobrille (@klobrille) <a href="https://twitter.com/klobrille/status/2013499425688039483?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 20, 2026</a></p></blockquote>  <p>It looks very neat (via<em> <a href="https://mp1st.com/news/fable-rebootconcept-art-showcase-locations">MP1st</a></em>). Will it be a modern open-world RPG? Who knows. But hopefully at least some of the game’s scenes can match the promise of its concept art. Will it actually come out in 2026? I’m still skeptical.</p>

 <h2>A message from Nintendo of America’s new leader</h2> <p>Recently promoted veteran Devon Pritchard appeared in a video at the New York Game Awards to encourage the next generation of creators (via <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/nintendo-of-americas-new-president-devon-pritchard-makes-her-first-industry-appearance-since-taking-on-the-role/"><em>VGC</em></a>). “And remember, like any good video game character, you’re on an adventure, and every step you take matters,” she said. “There are some gnarly bosses, sure, but also many good friends along the way who will support you and powerful rewards for those who persevere. So, keep believing, keep playing, and know that you truly belong in this game.”</p> <h2>Doug Bowser joins Hasbro’s Board of Directors</h2> <p>The ex-Nintendo of America president <a href="https://newsroom.hasbro.com/news-releases/news-release-details/hasbro-announces-additions-board-directors">will now be part of the corporate governance team</a> overseeing the owner of <em>Magic: The Gathering</em>, <em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons</em>, <em>Transformers</em>, and more. Is this the first step toward Nintendo doing a Universes Beyond <em>MTG</em> set? Probably not but I would, against my better judgement, buy the hell out of one.</p> <h2>ICYMI:</h2> <ul> <li><a href="https://kotaku.com/cyberpunk-2077-vr-mod-baldurs-gate-3-takedown-2000660987">A<em> Cyberpunk 2077</em> VR mod has been nuked after its creator tried to charge people for it</a></li> <li><a href="https://kotaku.com/assassins-creed-lawsuit-ubisoft-marc-alexis-cote-hexe-2000660833">The former head of <em>Assassin’s Creed</em> is suing Ubisoft over allegedly pushing him out of the company</a></li> <li><a href="https://kotaku.com/i-cant-stop-flicking-coins-and-hiring-tiny-dudes-in-this-new-steam-game-2000660664">This coin-flicking indie game is surprisingly good</a></li> </ul> <h2>Watch this:</h2>

            <title><![CDATA[Every Old Game Deserves A 60FPS Update]]></title>
            <link>https://kotaku.com/every-old-game-deserves-a-60fps-update-2000661290</link>
            <guid>1411039</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Returning to old games isn’t always easy. Depending on how old the game is, you might run into various problems, including unusual controls or compatibility issues. Another common point of friction you might encounter is an older game running poorly. This can make it a slog to replay some of the modern classics, even if they’re just a decade or so old. So I’m happy to see Ubisoft going back and updating performance in games like <em>Far Cry Primal</em> and <em>Assassin’s Creed Unity.</em></p> <p>Over the weekend, Ubisoft announced that <em>Far Cry 3 Classic</em> is getting an update on January 21 that will let it run at a smoother, higher 60FPS on PS5 and Xbox Series X/S. It’s a free patch and, assuming nothing breaks, it should just work once players have updated the remastered version of the tropical shooter. Later, on January 19, Ubisoft announced that<a href="https://bsky.app/profile/wario64.bsky.social/post/3mcrtpa5iy22r"><em> Far Cry 3: Blood Dragon Classic Edition</em> is also getting a 60FPS patch</a> on PS5 and Xbox Series X/S. And then, on Tuesday, Ubisoft revealed that<em> Far Cry Primal,</em> the primitive-era caveman spin-off, is getting a 60FPS patch for those same platforms. Both of these are landing on January 21, too.</p>

  <p>Updating three older PS4-era games for free to add in performance improvements on newer consoles is cool enough. But Ubisoft has actually been doing this for a bit now. In December 2025, <a href="https://x.com/TheDivisionGame/status/2001336590119866505?lang=en">Ubisoft updated the OG <em>Division</em> on PS5 to unlock 60FPS.</a> Last year, Ubisoft updated <em>Far Cry 4</em> for current-gen machines, and now it runs like butter at 60FPS. In 2024, <em>Assassin’s Creed Syndicate</em> got <a href="https://news.ubisoft.com/en-us/article/fuCzsNMoMUkbdiYyJCWQU/assassins-creed-syndicate-60-fps-console-patch-out-now">a nifty 60FPS patch for free as well</a>. And the year before that, <a href="https://news.ubisoft.com/en-us/article/6b7bacKsgYhFEhoamVRmx2/far-cry-5-gets-60-fps-patch-for-xbox-series-xs-ps5"><em>Far Cry 5 g</em>ot a 60FPS patch</a> for Xbox Series X/S and PS5.</p> <p>Ubisoft doesn’t have to do this. A lot of publishers don’t do this, which you can tell by all the people in the comments below Ubisoft’s announcements begging for similar updates to other games from other companies. And look, sometimes, it’s not an option. Some games are built around 30FPS and updating them is very tricky or too resource intensive. It’s not impossible, though. Just look <a href="https://kotaku.com/bloodborne-60fps-mod-hack-remaster-sequel-ps5-dmca-1851752593">at fan updates to <em>Bloodborne</em></a>.</p>

 <p>Still, if you can update an older game without too much trouble to get it running at 60FPS or higher, I think it’s a smart move. From a business point of view, Ubisoft can now continue to market these older games and likely sell new copies. <a href="https://kotaku.com/far-cry-tv-show-alien-earth-hulu-disney-rob-mac-2000647139">And with a<em> Far Cry</em> TV show in the works at FX</a>, Ubisoft has already ensured that if the show is a hit, people coming back to the older games it was inspired by will find a 60FPS experience that matches many of today’s games.</p>

 <p>Meanwhile, for me, these updates make it more likely that I’ll return to one of these classic Ubisoft games in the future if I feel the urge to stab people in the throat. Which franchise am I talking about? Either. Both. My point is that I’m a bit of a performance snob when it comes to games, and returning to the choppy 30FPS era of the PS4 and late Xbox 360 is always painful for my eyes and never feels great. Emulation isn’t really a solution either, as PS4 emulation is currently still in its early stages and not nearly as robust as what you’ll find in modern PS2 or PS3 emulators.</p> <p>So it’s very helpful that Ubisoft is going back and doing the work to get its back catalog of PS4-era games, including some bangers like<em> Far Cry 4</em>, running at 60FPS. <a href="https://kotaku.com/what-even-is-a-video-game-backlog-in-2026-2000659435">I mean, I don’t really need more games to add to my damn backlog,</a> but still, thanks.</p>
