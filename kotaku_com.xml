              <p>Valve still hasn’t revealed the full breakdown of what’s inside its new Steam Machine console or how much it will cost. Those details were delayed along <a href="https://kotaku.com/steam-machine-price-release-date-preorder-ai-valve-2000665802">with the device’s “early” 2026 launch</a> due to an AI-fueled PC part shortage. But the company did offer a fresh clue about how the mini-computer will perform, and it almost sounds too good to be true.</p> <p>“In our testing the majority of Steam titles play great at 4K 60FPS with FSR on Steam Machine,” the company <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/group/45479024/view/625565405086220583">wrote in a new update</a> on February 4. “That said, there are some titles that currently require more upscaling than others, and it may be preferable to play at a lower framerate with VRR to maintain a 1080p internal resolution. In the meantime, we are working on HDMI VRR, investigating improved upscaling, and optimizing ray tracing performance in the driver, so we are approaching this from multiple angles.”</p>

 <p>Steam users are…skeptical. “I don’t see how that’s possible on many, if not most current AAA games,” wrote one commenter. “The hardware just isn’t there. Isn’t this supposed to be a 3050 or lower class device?” Another wrote, “I don’t think the hardware is capable of delivering this promise. I have a 12 GB 3060. Which, presumably, is a significantly more powerful GPU than the one being offered. But it’s a still a lower-end GPU and I’m not playing any AAA games at 4K.”</p> <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/valve-steam-machine-frame-deck-console-controller-announced-2000643535">It’s hard to know what exactly that means</a> since thousands of new games come to Steam every year and most of them are small indie games that aren’t very demanding to run. The Steam Machine might run <em>Hollow Knight: Silksong</em> and <em>Slay the Spire 2</em> at 4K 60FPS no problem, but what about <em>Resident Evil Requiem</em> and <em>Crimson Desert</em>, both AAA blockbusters coming to Valve’s storefront over the next couple of months? Not to mention all of the games that launched last year with PC performance issues like<em> Monster Hunter Wilds</em> and <em>Borderlands 4</em>.</p>

 <p>If the Steam Machine can pull off 4K 60FPS for even some of those big games without too much frame generation or upscaling, it would have a lot to offer not just console players but people coming from lower-end or very dated PC gaming rigs. But it also probably won’t come cheap. Then again, in this new world where gaming <a href="https://kotaku.com/target-employee-shows-pc-game-memory-part-price-increases-shortage-ram-ssd-2000663863">gets more expensive every year</a>, who’s to say what even still counts as “cheap.”</p>

            <title><![CDATA[The AI-Fueled PC Gaming Shortage Just Delayed Valve’s Steam Machine]]></title>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/valve-steam-machine-frame-deck-console-controller-announced-2000643535">The Steam Machine</a>, Valve’s ambitious new venture into living room console gaming, was supposed to begin shipping in “early” 2026. That’s no longer the case. The company announced on Wednesday that its original launch plans have been pushed back to later in the year due to memory and storage shortages as companies race to pivot to AI.</p> <p>“When we announced these products in November, we planned on being able to share specific pricing and launch dates by now,” Valve wrote in a new <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/group/45479024/view/625565405086220583">February 4 blog post</a>. “But the memory and storage shortages you’ve likely heard about across the industry have rapidly increased since then. The limited availability and growing prices of these critical components mean we must revisit our exact shipping schedule and pricing (especially around Steam Machine and Steam Frame).”</p>

 <p>The plan is still to ship the Steam Machine, a new Steam controller, and the new Steam Frame VR headset within the first half of 2026. That suggests the first units should still arrive in players’ hands sometime before June 30. But Valve adds that market conditions are currently shifting too quickly to confirm “concrete pricing and launch dates” at the start of 2026 as previously planned.</p> <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/steam-machine-valve-console-price-ps5-pro-2000643554">First revealed back in November</a>, the Steam Machine is a small cube-shaped console with PC gaming specs somewhere between a PlayStation 5 and a PS5 Pro. The device is targeting the most common specs of the average Steam user with the goal of playing most games at 4K 60FPS with FSR enabled. This has led to lots of speculation about how much the device might actually cost, with Valve confirming it’s not planning to sell Steam Machines at a loss and declining to say whether it will be close to the current average console price of $500.</p>

 <p>And that was before PC components from RAM to graphics cards started significantly increasing in price as part supplies are monopolized by companies investing in AI datacenters. Employees at retailers like <a href="https://kotaku.com/target-employee-shows-pc-game-memory-part-price-increases-shortage-ram-ssd-2000663863">GameStop and Target</a> have showed SSDs for PS5s and other upgrades spiking in price overnight, and some companies have shifted out of the consumer market altogether. While Valve seems to be waiting to see if things calm down at all, there’s no indication yet that this isn’t just the new normal.</p>
