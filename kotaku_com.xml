            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><span>As great as beat-em-ups can be, it’s also pretty easy for them to become repetitive and dull. The genre has its roots in the arcade, where upon death, players were encouraged to pump more coins through the slot for a chance to get back in the ring and continue smacking fools around. They can be challenging, but the gap between that and mindlessness can be pretty slim, at least in lesser examples of the genre. </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/summer-game-fest-previews-sonic-resident-evil-play-days-1851784271"><i><span>Absolum</span></i></a><i><span>,</span></i><span> the fantasy beat-em-up from </span><i><span>Streets of Rage 4 </span></i><span>co-developer Guard Crush Games and Supamonks, clears the gap so effortlessly that it’s skyrocketing to near the top of my favorite beat-em-ups I’ve ever played. It takes a genre that, when in the wrong hands, can be monotonous, and puts a roguelike spin on it that keeps it fresh and challenging, even as you beat your head against the wall in repeated runs.</span></p> <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/absolum-golden-axe-beat-em-up-rpg-rogulike-fantasy-1851767831"><i><span>Absolum</span></i></a><span> takes obvious influence from other roguelikes like </span><i><span>Hades</span></i><span> in that it uses death as both a teaching tool and a narrative crux. Much of it is a pretty standard fantasy fare, with four rebellious wizards repeatedly fighting their way through angry villagers, monsters, and tyrants, and each time they die in battle, they’re revived so they can start at the beginning and do it all over again. Maybe, with the right loadouts and abilities, they’ll make it to the end this time. Or perhaps, they’ll be dealt a bad hand, meet an early end, and go right back to the starting line.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><span>Roguelikes are all about chance and making the best of what you’ve been given, and </span><i><span>Absolum</span></i><span>’s fantasy dressings make even the most mundane fights a spectacle. After most encounters, you’ll be granted one of two “rituals,” which are modifiers whose benefits can be as simple as increased power, or as transformative as new attacks. I played primarily as Cider, a speedy, masked assailant who wields handaxes and uses a hookshot to pull herself into enemies to close the distance with ease. Without any rituals equipped, she’s already a vicious, combo-centric fighter who can take most foes down without breaking a sweat. With rituals, she can trap enemies in a bubble at the end of her combos, leaving them open to further assault, or burn them by leaving a trail of flames behind her as she dashes on the battlefield. I wasn’t thrilled with every option I was given, but </span><i><span>Absolum </span></i><span>feels so good and snappy to play that I was always more than willing to see a bad run through to the end.&nbsp;</span></p>

  <p><span>The beauty of beat-em-ups is the almost rage-room-like catharsis of slogging crowds of baddies who would do you harm, and </span><i><span>Absolum</span></i><span>’s tools to do so are so vast, varied, and destructive that even the smallest scraps feel like a choreographed setpiece full of happy accidents. I’d often start whaling on a dude, only to have forgotten the passive buffs I’d given myself until they triggered a chain reaction of combos on multiple foes at once. </span><i><span>Absolum </span></i><span>is a delight to watch unfold thanks to its slick animation and gorgeous, hand-drawn art. Its characters move in an expressive, flowing dance of violence, and every effect that flows from their weapons is eye-catching, but never veers into the kind of sensory overload that would make its precise combo-driven fights harder to read.</span></p> <p><span>I’m still chipping away at runs and cracking the foundations of </span><i><span>Absolum</span></i><span>’s world, but my short few hours or so with it have been more than enough to keep me banging my head against its stone gates. It is one of the most rewarding spins on both the beat-em-up and roguelike genres I’ve played all year.</span></p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/apple-watch-series-10-is-still-going-at-prime-days-lowest-price-as-if-amazons-clearing-out-leftovers-2000633308</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/apple-watch-series-10-is-still-going-at-prime-day%E2%80%99s-lowest-price-as-amazon%E2%80%99s-clearing-out-leftovers.1320664/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>When you think of an “out of date” product, you tend to think in years or even decades, not months. So, technically, the Apple Watch Series 10 is “previous-gen” now that the Series 11 has arrived. But the darn thing just debuted a year ago, so it’s hardly out of date. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4666/">But that’s how it’s being priced right now at Amazon in an awesome post-Prime Day deal</a>.</p>
<p>The Series 10 release in September 2024 hailed the smartwatch’s screen, 30% larger than previous models, and this is the 46mm model, so the screen size is indeed ample and very easy to read, day or night. The health and fitness features are terrific, including heart and respiratory rate tracking, irregular heart rhythm detection, sleep level and menstrual cycle tracking.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4666/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Who You Calling Old?</h2>
<p>The Series 11 is over 20 percent more expensive than the Series 10, so it begs the question, what are the actual differences? The Series 11 boasts more-durable glass, a longer battery life, and a couple more health features. But the Series 10 is hardly fragile, since it was designed as a fitness-oriented smartwatch for active-lifestyle enthusiasts. It’s crack-resistant, IP6X-certified dust-resistant, and water-resistant down to 50 meters. Try it — there are water depth and temperature sensors built in, too.</p>
<p>The 18-hour battery life is definitely nothing to sneeze at. It’s still one of the best wearable health trackers on the market, with fall detection and crash detection that could literally save your life if you’re in an accident and unable to call for help. So that extra 20-plus percent for the Series 11? You might just be paying that extra money to cure your FOMO.</p>



<h2>Big-Time Score</h2>
<p>We’re admittedly previous-gen bargain hunters, but the Series 10 overdelivers in this new price in a huge way. Three of the model colors are covered by this post-Prime Day deal, including the often-elusive Rose Gold mode that usually demands a higher price. This deal is also sweetened with three free months of Apple Fitness+ so you can put all of the many fitness features to their optimal use.</p>
<p>FOMO is real, especially when it comes to Apple enthusiasts. This Amazon deal presents the question — are you going to join the herd and shell out the extra cash to ensure that you have&nbsp;<em>the</em> most recent Apple Watch, or <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4666/">are you going to save big bucks by taking this deal on the Apple Watch 10, barely one year old, and now selling for its all-time lowest price?</a> Our vote is already cast.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Seagate’s 2TB Xbox Expansion Card Is Just $0.10 per GB, Lowest Price Even After Prime Day]]></title>
            <link>https://kotaku.com/seagates-2tb-xbox-expansion-card-is-just-0-10-per-gb-lowest-price-even-after-prime-day-2000633315</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/seagate%E2%80%99s-2tb-xbox-expansion-card-is-just-0-10-per-gb-lowest-price-even-after-prime-day.1320622/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Some of the post-Prime Day deals we’re seeing on Amazon are making us wonder whether it’s actually really over at all, or if somehow we’ve been time-warped straight to Black Friday. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4009/">Why else would the Seagate 2TB Storage Expansion Drive for Xbox Series X and Series S be showing up for a huge 44% discount all the way down to just $200</a>? It’s normally a $360 investment, but now it’s a $200 bargain.</p>
<p>There are a ton of expansion drives on the market that claim they’re compatible with the Xbox Series X and Series S, and many of them probably are. But this Seagate 2TB Storage Expansion Drive is the one and only one that has Microsoft’s official stamp of approval, because it was designed specifically for the Xbox. It runs on the same platform, and unlike the USB models, it fits directly into the console’s expansion port.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4009/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">Ver en Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Plug and Play</h2>
<p>Portable SSDs are pretty okay for console use, but let’s look at the hazards. That USB cord connection can be tenuous, always just one jiggle or curious cat swipe away from popping out of the console, and always at the worst possible time. Then there’s the formatting, which may be a decent fit, but it won’t be&nbsp;<em>the</em> perfect, seamless fit with your Xbox, because that’s proprietary software, and Microsoft gets touchy about that.</p>
<p>The Seagate Expansion Drive has that proprietary software, because it’s officially licensed by Microsoft. That makes a huge difference when you’re mid-game, because the speed of the Seagate is not compromised ever by the translation that has to occur between other expansion drives and the Xbox. It might as well be an internal storage drive, because it’s essentially part of the Xbox. And there’s no USB cable, or any cable at all. It plugs into the expansion port at the rear of the Xbox, and sits there firmly, with a low profile so ensure it’s not knocked askew.</p>



<h2>The Space You Need</h2>
<p>It’s just a reality that as video games get more complex, more detailed, and more immersive, the file sizes grow along with it. New games can be downright huge, like&nbsp;<em>Forza Motorsport</em> weighing in at 132GB or <em>Halo Infinite</em> at 91GB. If you have an Xbox with 512GB of built-in storage, that’s going to vanish almost instantly. Plug in the 2TB Seagate Expansion Drive and you instantly quadruple that space.</p>
<p>The time — and the price — are right for you to ensure your Xbox Series X or S has all the space it needs ahead of the holiday season, because you know there will be hot new games dropping like crazy. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4009/">The Seagate 2TB Storage Expansion Drive is just $200 right now at Amazon, a 44% post-Prime Day bonanza you do not want to miss.&nbsp;</a></p>

            <title><![CDATA[Nintendo Switch Online Adds Mario Game Never Seen Before Outside Japan]]></title>
            <link>https://kotaku.com/nintendo-switch-online-adds-mario-game-never-seen-before-outside-japan-2000633627</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/nintendo-switch-online-adds-mario-game-never-seen-before-outside-japan.1320595/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Every addition to Nintendo’s online catalog of classic games is a welcome one. Not least because there’s no reason on Earth that the company doesn’t just add them all at once, given they’ll <a href="https://kotaku.com/nintendo-switch-piracy-reddit-mod-archbox-million-2000631966">sue you into the sun</a> if you try to play the 30-year-old games by any other means. But this latest update for the SNES collection in what’s now called Nintendo Classics, alongside a&nbsp;<em>Bubsy</em> and a <em>Fatal Fury</em>,&nbsp;features a <em>Mario</em> game that’s never been released outside of Japan before.</p> <p>Let’s do <em>Bubsy In: Claws Encounters of the Furred Kind</em> first. You have to forgive the double-punning title, because the SNES and Genesis release was extremely well received in 1993. The first of eight <em>Bubsy</em> platform games (with <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4bq6P8e5gk">a ninth to come next year</a> from an increasingly desperate Atari), the nothing-like-a-bobcat Bubsy sets out to save…balls of yarn. Not exactly high-peril stakes, but a classic piece of 16-bit platforming with an animation style you just don’t see any more.</p>

 <p>Next up is&nbsp;<em>Fatal Fury: Special</em>, a 1994 SNES release following its 1993 arcade debut. It was the third game in the <em>Fatal Fury</em> fighting game franchise, and essentially an improved version of 1992’s&nbsp;<em>Fatal Fury 2</em>. It added previously CPU-only boss characters to the fighting roster, and rather significantly added combos to the series. It has looped around in the past, with an Xbox Arcade release in 2007, a Wii version in 2009, and then yet again appeared on consoles in 2017. While the Neo Geo version is generally thought to be the best, this is obviously an emulation of the SNES port.</p>

 <p>The final addition is certainly the most intriguing.&nbsp;<em>Mario &amp; Wario</em> was put out for the Super Famicom in 1993, but then never went on to receive a worldwide release—even though the game was entirely in English. But now the rest of the world can finally discover this peculiar <em>Lemmings</em>-like puzzle-platformer featuring Mario stumbling around levels with objects obscuring his view after Wario wedged them over his head. You play as Wanda, a fairy, who magics the levels’ platforms to keep Mario safe and guide him to Luigi who’ll pull the object off his noggin. And she did all this using the SNES’s mouse peripheral. So yes, with the Switch 2’s mouse-like controllers, that’s achievable once more.</p>  <p>Because these are SNES games, they’re included in the basic, cheaper version of Nintendo’s Switch Online subscription package, rather than the nonsensically named “+ Expansion Pack” higher tier. So, that’s the $20 a year version, unfortunately necessary if you want to play any Switch games online or use the save cloud feature. The Expansion Pack addition bumps it up to $50 a year (so, you know, two months of Game Pass) and adds in GameCube, N64, Genesis and GBA catalogs, as well as “free” DLC for a few Nintendo games.</p>
