              <p><em>Indiana Jones and the Great Circle</em> is Microsoft’s first release confirmed for Switch 2. The stealth action adventure will hit Nintendo’s handheld hybrid in 2026, but the new DLC will arrive next month on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC.</p> <p>MachineGames’ latest port to a Nintendo platform didn’t get a specific release date, so we have no idea if it’s coming in the first half of 2026 or the holiday season. We also don’t know what it will look like since there was no accompanying gameplay teaser. I guess all those Switch 2 dev kits really did go out late, even to places like Microsoft.</p> <p>But we did get another trailer at Gamescom for the upcoming <em>Order of the Giants</em> DLC expansion coming to <em>Indiana Jones</em>. Also a release date: September 6. Here’s the new footage:</p>

 <p><iframe loading="lazy" title="Launch Trailer – Indiana Jones and the Great Circle™: The Order of Giants" width="500" height="281" src="about:blank" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen="" data-rocket-lazyload="fitvidscompatible" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/XD9Q3nIpMqQ?feature=oembed"></iframe></p> <p>It looks neat, although Troy Baker seems to be reverting back to his usual voice a bit. Story expansions are hit-or-miss with single-player games, but <em>Indiana Jones and the Great Circle</em> is close enough to feeling like a movie that I could see a bite-sized adventure being a nice treat.</p> <p>Microsoft hasn’t yet announced any other ports for Switch 2, including ones that feel obvious like Sea<em> of Thieves</em> or<em> Diablo 4</em>. Hopefully, <em>Indiana Jones</em> means the dam is about to break on all of those, though it seems like we’ll have to wait until next year, and possibly beyond for most of them.</p>

              <p>During Gamescom Opening Night Live 2025,&nbsp; <a href="https://kotaku.com/fallout-show-amazon-review-1851400505"><em>Fallout</em> TV show</a> producer and creator Johnathan Nolan got on stage with stars Ella Purnell and Aaron Moten to tease the upcoming second season of the show. And they brought with them a trailer for season two that is packed with references for <span>fans</span>&nbsp;to go wild over.</p> <p>Here’s the trailer for <a href="https://kotaku.com/fallout-season-2-teaser-images-new-vegas-lucky-38-mr-house-lucy-2000618233"><em>Fallout</em> season two</a>, which begins on Amazon Prime on December 17:</p> <p><iframe loading="lazy" title="Fallout – Season Two Teaser Trailer | Prime Video" width="500" height="281" src="about:blank" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen="" data-rocket-lazyload="fitvidscompatible" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/7TsP09cZA7o?feature=oembed"></iframe></p> <p>After premiering in April 2024, the <em>Fallout</em> series received rave reviews, lots of award nominations, and big ratings for Amazon, leading directly to a massive increase in the number of people playing old <em>Fallout</em> games. Not surprisingly, following all this success, Amazon quickly announced a second season, <a href="https://kotaku.com/fallout-season-2-amazon-prime-bethesda-1851421573">which wrapped up filming in May</a>. The highly anticipated new season of&nbsp;<em>Fallout</em>&nbsp;arrives on Amazon Prime this December, and&nbsp;<a href="https://kotaku.com/fallout-season-2-trailer-new-vegas-season-3-ghoul-lucy-1851780416">the show has already been picked up for a third season</a>.&nbsp; This new teaser trailer from Gamescom has me, a big <em>Fallout</em> fan, very excited, as it looks to be turning the knob labeled “<em>Fallout</em> Shit” up to 11.</p>

 <p>In this new trailer, we see Las Vegas before it’s bombed and becomes New Vegas, famously seen in Obsidian’s <em>Fallout: New Vegas</em>. We also see Mr. House’s Lucky 38 casino and his massive office at the top. We also see the man himself, played by Justin Theroux. He and Howard Cooper, aka The Ghoul, seem to have a close relationship. I also spotted plenty of stuff from <em>Fallout</em>: <em>New Vegas</em>, including: Caesar’s Legion, the famous dinosaur statue, a dangerous Deathclaw, and the helpful robot Victor.</p> <p><em>Fallout’s</em> second season premieres on Amazon Prime on December 17, and episodes will air weekly after that.</p>
