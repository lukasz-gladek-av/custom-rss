              <p>In June, Roborock released a line of affordable robot vacuums after the unveiling of ultra-premium models (Saros line) during CES. Luckily, some of these models are already on sale, <strong>like the Roborock QV 35A</strong>, which is now <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3822/">listed on the official Roborock website for just $399 instead of $599, which is a nice 40% off for the 11th anniversary of the brand</a>. Even though it is in the budget category, this robot vacuum is still one of the most feature-packed models on the market.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3822/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Roborock.com</a></p>

<h2>Multifunctional Dock</h2>
<p>The QV 35A begins with a bang with an<strong> incredible 8000 Pa HyperForce suction</strong> which is way more than enough to effortlessly remove dust, dirt, and pet hair from carpets and hard floors. Of particular note here is the <strong>zero-tangle arc side brush</strong> that is designed to pick up debris without hair becoming tangled and caught. If you have pets shedding or long hair around, this spares a great deal of annoyance from frequent maintenance.</p>
<p>Its <strong>all-in-one multifunctional station</strong> is a game changer here: Not only is it the charging dock, but it also cleans the mop with cold air drying, auto-empties the dust, and refills the water tank so that the robot is always ready to go without much fuss from you.</p>
<p>The QV 35A also features<strong> twin rotating mops and automatically raises the mop when it encounters carpet</strong>&nbsp;so it’s capable of both vacuuming and mopping at the same time. With this kind of electronic mopping system, you have control over water flow and deep cleaning according to different surfaces so that your floors get the treatment they need without damage or leftover moisture.</p>



<p>Thanks to PreciSense LiDAR navigation, <strong>this model creates a map of your home with incredible precision</strong>. It creates 3D maps and uses intelligent planning to determine the most efficient cleaning route. The robot avoids obstacles on its own thanks to reactive tech, easily working around furniture and other domestic items without stopping.</p>
<p>With the 11th anniversary sale cutting nearly 40% off the cost, it’s the best time to acquire a premium robot vacuum.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><em>Star Wars Outlaws</em> is <a href="https://kotaku.com/switch-2-ports-cyberpunk-2077-ps4-ps5-xbox-dlss-outlaws-1851782817">coming to Switch 2</a> in just a few days. It’s Ubisoft’s first big port for Nintendo’s new handheld hybrid. So why isn’t the company talking more about its 2024 blockbuster coming to the best-selling console of 2025? Maybe because it’s the latest Switch 2 port to reportedly run less than great.</p> <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/star-wars-outlaws-review-size-how-big-hours-xbox-ps5-pc-1851631123"><em>Star Wars Outlaws</em></a>, a stealth adventure about gangsters and bounty hunters on the fringes of the Galactic Empire, is currently the 10th best-selling game on the Switch 2 eShop thanks to digital pre-orders, but you won’t find it anywhere on the show floor at PAX West this weekend. Despite stations for fans to try big ports like <em>Elden Ring</em> and <em>Borderlands 4</em> on Nintendo’s new hardware, a demo of <em>Star Wars Outlaws</em> was only playable behind closed doors, according to YouTube channel <em>GVG</em>‘s <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A5JbnfU0SVs">new hands-on video</a>.</p> <p>Even worse, the outlet was prohibited from sharing any direct capture footage of <em>Star Wars Outlaws</em> running on Switch 2. Over-the-shoulder recording wasn’t allowed either. The demo <em>GVG</em> tested included an early section inside of a Star Destroyer and a ship fight in space. The frame rate often appeared to dip below 30fps while the visual quality varied from good to unimpressive depending on the scene. And <em>GVG</em> didn’t even get to try any of the open-world sections down on planets.</p>

 <p>There have been some potential red flags around<em> Star Wars Outlaws</em>‘ performance on Switch 2 for a while now. At a Partner Nintendo Direct earlier this summer, Ubisoft only <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GIBt_Qnf1_M">showcased the game for two minutes</a>, and most of that was developers (Ubisoft Red Lynx is doing the port) talking into the camera rather than direct feed of gameplay. What little snippets the publisher did share didn’t look outstanding either. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OCYL2f49jyQ"><em>Digital Foundry</em> pointed</a> to some impressive lighting effects at the time, but was left mostly with concerns about just how downgraded it would be from the PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X/S versions.</p> <h2>How will <em>Assassin’s Creed Shadows</em> run on Switch 2?</h2> <p>While not officially confirmed, <a href="https://kotaku.com/assassins-creed-shadows-switch-2-port-release-date-1851786749">reading between the lines</a> of recent Ubisoft earnings calls leaves the strong impression that <em>Star Wars Outlaws</em> isn’t the only current-gen exclusive the company is planning to port to Switch 2. <em>Assassin’s Creed Shadows</em> sounds destined to arrive eventually as well. Has Ubisoft been investing more resources in optimizing that port, knowing it’s the bigger franchise, at the cost of quietly leaving<em> Outlaws</em> to flounder a second time (remember,<em> Shadows</em> was originally delayed precisely because of <em>Outlaws</em> launch struggles last year)?</p>

 <p>Right now, there are basically two buckets of third-party Switch 2 ports. One includes <em>Cyberpunk 2077</em> and <em>Street Fighter 6</em>, which rarely remind you that you’re playing on weaker hardware than what the games were originally designed for. The other includes stuff like<em> Hitman World of Assassination</em>, which despite being serviceable, often feels like a noticeable downgrade (though things improved <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STjJVzd-FWI">just this week</a> with a capped frame rate option).</p> <p><em>Elden Ring</em>, which reportedly ran like goop when you hit the open-world sections, and now <em>Star Wars Outlaws</em> appear to be in that second bucket as well. Bandai Namco tried to prevent people from filming footage of FromSoftware’s <a href="https://kotaku.com/elden-ring-switch-2-framerate-footage-video-gamescom-2000618923">first Switch 2 game at Gamescom 2025</a> as well, though that game at least doesn’t have a release date yet. Unless a day-one patch or series of other upgrades can improve <em>Outlaws</em> on Switch 2, there’s now a question of whether a potential <em>Shadows</em> port will fall into the “meh” column of ports as well.</p>

              <p>A computer is not just a bright new device: it’s also an entrance to your entire digital life. But with that entrance comes the <strong>threat of dark unseen dangers</strong>: hackers, scams, and viruses just waiting to leap at the most inconvenient time.
