              <p>The hack-and-slash <a href="https://kotaku.com/hyrule-warriors-age-of-calamity-the-kotaku-review-1845702074"><em>Warriors</em> spin-offs</a> on Nintendo Switch have been easy to skip. The arcade action can be fun and the character interactions rewarding for fans of the given franchise, but for the most part they’ve done little to break out of the fan service bubble. <em>Hyrule Warriors: Age of Imprisonment</em> might be different. Early reviews suggest the <em>Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom</em> spin-off isn’t just a must-play for hardcore fans but a decent action game that new Switch 2 owners should be paying attention to.</p> <p>Out November 6 as an exclusive for Nintendo’s new hardware, the Koei Tecmo-developed musou game is the first major next-gen-only release the Switch 2 has seen since <a href="https://kotaku.com/donkey-kong-bananza-destructible-environments-ocd-1851786630"><em>Donkey Kong Bananza</em></a> in July. It’s currently sporting a not altogether impressive Metacritic score of 78, which is exactly in line with how the previous games in the subseries, <em>Hyrule Warriors</em> and <em>Hyrule Warriors: Age of Calamity</em>, performed. Beneath some of the criticism of the repetitive combat and less-than-excellent mission design, however, early reviews are generally more positive than I was expecting.</p>

 <p>“I might hesitate to call<em>&nbsp;Age of Imprisonment</em> an ‘essential’ Switch 2 game, but it’s a crucial piece of giving the system a strongly varied first-year lineup,” writes Hayes Madsen <a href="https://www.inverse.com/gaming/hyrule-warriors-age-of-imprisonment-review">for<em> Inverse</em></a>, who praised some of its<em> Star Fox</em>-like missions and said the story “genuinely enhances&nbsp;<em>Tears of the Kingdom.” </em>Chris Scullion, reviewing <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/review/hyrule-warriors-age-of-imprisonment/">for <em>VGC</em>,</a> was even more upbeat, writing, <em>“Age of Imprisonment</em> may be the most serious of the <em>Hyrule Warriors</em> games to date, but it’s also the one with the most engaging and rewarding combat.”</p>

 <p>Not everyone was equally impressed. “Repetition is baked into the genre, but its zen-like nature is stripped away in the latter parts of <em>Age of Imprisonment</em>‘s campaign as you’re forced to replay the same sorts of missions over and over again,” wrote Richard Wakeling <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/hyrule-warriors-age-of-imprisonment-review-link-to-the-past/1900-6418434/">for <em>GameSpot</em></a>. “Many missions only take place in small slithers of battlefields, and even the ones in bigger areas shuffle you quite cleanly from point to point,” wrote Oscar Taylor-Kent <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/the-legend-of-zelda/hyrule-warriors-age-of-imprisonment-review/">for<em> Gamesradar</em></a>. “There’s very little sense of scope to any of the environments, instead feeling just like corridors and rooms.”</p> <p>One thing to note: some big sites haven’t even published their <em>Hyrule Warriors: Age of Imprisonment</em> reviews yet because Nintendo’s embargo restrictions were too onerous. “Restrictions Nintendo sent alongside a review code were particularly strict this time around, preventing reviews that publish ahead of launch from discussing&nbsp;<em>any&nbsp;</em>non-public story details whatsoever,” <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/hyrule-warriors-age-of-imprisonment-review">reported<em> IGN</em></a>. <em>The Verge </em>also opted <a href="https://www.theverge.com/entertainment/813136/review-imprisoned-for-now">to wait until launch</a> to share its review. <em>Polygon</em> isn’t <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/marioprime.bsky.social/post/3m4spqbnwwk2o">publishing its take yet either</a>. In the meantime, here’s what everyone else is saying.</p> <h2><em><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/hyrule-warriors-age-of-imprisonment-review-link-to-the-past/1900-6418434/">GameSpot</a></em></h2> <blockquote><p>“Without any technical hiccups getting in the way, combat is still the star of <em>Hyrule Warriors: Age of Imprisonment</em>. Unique Skills and Sync Strikes bring increased depth to its hack-and-slash histrionics, while elements of <em>Tears of the Kingdom</em> are smartly adapted to fit the musou genre. The story doesn’t feel essential enough to satisfy pure Zelda fans, but by ironing out its predecessor’s performance issues and introducing a varied roster of rewarding characters, <em>Age of Imprisonment</em> marks a high point for the spin-off series thus far.” — Richard Wakeling</p></blockquote> <h2><em><a href="https://www.rollingstone.com/culture/rs-gaming/hyrule-warriors-age-of-imprisonment-switch-2-review-1235458481/">Rolling Stone</a></em></h2> <blockquote><p>“As a <em>Zelda</em>&nbsp;title, it effectively continues the worldbuilding from the&nbsp;<em>Beath of the Wild</em>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<em>Tears of the Kingdom</em>&nbsp;duology; it also provides a sense of real agency for the princess herself, who somehow hadn’t even starred in her own game until last year’s disappointing&nbsp;<em>Echoes of Wisdom</em>. As a musou, it also manages to elevate the well-worn trappings of the subgenre by incorporating a shocking amount of actual&nbsp;<em>Zelda</em> mechanics.” — Christopher Cruz</p></blockquote> <h2><em><a href="https://www.inverse.com/gaming/hyrule-warriors-age-of-imprisonment-review">Inverse</a></em></h2> <blockquote><p>“The core structure of<em>&nbsp;Age of Imprisonment&nbsp;</em>is entirely focused on taking over bases and fighting bosses. You don’t need to control the battlefield like in the <em>Fire Emblem</em> games, and allies largely can’t do damage to enemies — they’re only there to help support you. A good way to think of it is that this is a character action game (like <em>Devil May Cry</em>) grafted onto the bones of the <em>Warriors</em> structure — but it works.” — Hayes Madsen</p></blockquote> <h2><em><a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/the-legend-of-zelda/hyrule-warriors-age-of-imprisonment-review/">Gamesradar</a></em></h2> <blockquote><p>“<em>Age of Calamity</em> had a range of diverse and interestingly shaped maps, but<em> Age of Imprisonment</em>‘s feel bland in comparison – even when some maps are essentially the same as in the other game, the undemanding structure makes them worse in this outing. One specific wooded area is still a banger, though. Revisiting <em>Age of Calamity</em> alongside this new one, I had way more fun fighting back through even early encounters there, with sprawling battlefields and pockets of fighting.” — Oscar Taylor-Kent</p></blockquote> <h2><em><a href="https://www.rpgsite.net/review/18880-hyrule-warriors-age-imprisonment-review">RPG Site</a></em></h2> <blockquote><p>For a certain type of player, <em>Hyrule Warriors: Age of Imprisonment</em> will be the single game you’ll end up sinking the most time into on your Switch 2. If it wasn’t for every other RPG I’ve yet to play this year, I might have ended up in those shoes. <em>Age of Imprisonment</em> isn’t just a great <em>Zelda</em> spinoff, but confidently stands among some of the singular best games in the entire <em>Zelda</em> series. I simply can’t recommend it enough for anyone who is a fan of the <em>Warriors</em>‘ genre. — James Galizio</p></blockquote> <h2><em><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/hyrule-warriors-age-of-imprisonment-impressions-review-story-gameplay">Eurogamer</a></em></h2> <blockquote><p>Oh, and here’s a bonus: this is one of these games that&nbsp;<em>runs well</em>. I don’t associate <em>Warriors</em> with that, even on higher-end consoles. But this is great. I don’t know if it began life as a Switch 1 game and was then shifted to the successor machine or what, but whatever the reasoning I’m thrilled to note that this looks nice enough but also maintains a solid and high frame rate, even when hundreds of troops are bouncing around on screen. — Alex Donaldson</p></blockquote> <h2><em><a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/review/hyrule-warriors-age-of-imprisonment/">VGC</a></em></h2> <blockquote><p>In terms of the actual gameplay itself, <em>Age of Imprisonment</em> is undoubtedly still a<em> Warriors</em> game – for the uninitiated, Koei Tecmo’s <em>Dynasty Warriors</em> series has had numerous licensed spin-offs for the likes of <em>One Piece</em>, <em>Dragon Quest</em>,<em> Fire Emblem</em>, <em>Persona</em> and these <em>Zelda</em>-themed <em>Hyrule Warriors</em> titles – but it also feels a bit like a game trying even more than its predecessors to appeal to those not interested in its hack-and-slash principles. — Chris Scullion</p></blockquote> <h2><em><a href="https://www.pcmag.com/reviews/hyrule-warriors-age-of-imprisonment">PC Mag</a></em></h2> <blockquote><p>I went into <em>Age of Imprisonment</em> thinking I knew what to expect, but I was surprised by what I found. The improved performance—especially in local multiplayer—as well as the tweaks to combat really made the game stand out among the many <em>Warriors</em> titles. <em>Zelda</em> fans looking for a traditional adventure should look elsewhere. But if you’re down for an <a href="https://www.pcmag.com/picks/the-best-pc-action-games" target="_self" rel="noopener">action game</a> that’ll easily steal dozens of hours of your life, <em>Hyrule Warriors: Age of Imprisonment</em> is a terrific time. — Zackery Cuevas</p></blockquote>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/this-beginner-telescope-now-costs-as-much-as-a-toy-yet-comes-with-two-real-eyepieces-2000641087</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>We’ve all looked up at the night sky and wondered what those lights really look like up close. Stars, planets, the craters on the moon – they’re all up there, waiting to be explored but telescopes have always seemed either too expensive or too complicated to bother with.</p>
<p>The <em>Hexeum</em> <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5327/">beginner telescope just dropped to $85 from $149 on Amazon</a>, and brings real astronomy within reach of anyone curious enough to point it at the sky. This isn’t a toy telescope that shows you blurry dots, it’s an<strong> 80mm aperture refractor with actual quality optics, two real eyepieces and a Barlow lens that magnifies the moon up to 180 times</strong>.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5327/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Optics That Show You Something Worth Seeing</h2>
<p>With an aperture of 80mm, it captures much more light compared to smaller and entry-level scopes which will directly translate into a view that is brighter and clearer of the night’s starry objects. The focal length of 600mm at f/6.7 gives a balance between the wide-field views for star clusters and closer views of planets and the moon. Fully multi-coated lenses mean reduced light loss and increased brightness and clarity in the image so instead of a washed-out blob, you’re actually seeing sharp detail.</p>
<p>Right out of the box, the two eyepieces give you flexibility: The <strong>25mm eyepiece gives 24x magnification,</strong> perfect for scanning the sky to find objects or viewing larger targets like the Andromeda Galaxy or the Pleiades star cluster. The <strong>10mm eyepiece bumps you up to 60x magnification</strong> for detailed views of the moon’s craters, Jupiter’s bands or Saturn’s rings. The 3<strong>x Barlow lens triples the magnifying power of each eyepiece</strong> and pushes you to 72x and 180x when you want to zoom in even closer.</p>



<p>The adjustable aluminum tripod holds the telescope steady during viewing which is more important than one might think. Any shimmy or wobble gets magnified along with the image and turns the planets into jittery blurs. Sturdy construction means you don’t have to fight vibrations every time you touch the scope, so smooth focusing isn’t a problem. <strong>A phone adapter lets you snap photos of what you see</strong> by mounting your smartphone onto the eyepiece and turns casual star-gazing into shareable moments.</p>
<p>For $85, you’re paying what some people spend on a nice dinner for a tool that opens up an entirely new hobby. The lifetime maintenance support means you’re covered if anything goes wrong, and the responsive customer service handles questions within 24 hours. This telescope gives you real views of real astronomical objects-the phases of Venus, the moons of Jupiter orbiting in real-time, the rings of Saturn and countless star clusters.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/logitech-g502-hero-gaming-mouse-is-going-for-peanuts-amazon-clears-out-last-units-at-47-off-2000641070</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/logitech-g502-hero-gaming-mouse-is-going-for-peanuts-amazon-clears-out-last-units-at-47-off.1343251/</guid>

              <p>You know it: your gaming mouse is what makes… or breaks your performance. That split-second delay, the cursor skipping across the screen during a flick shot, or buttons that don’t register fast enough-all deal breakers when you’re trying to rank up. The Logitech G502 Hero has been a favorite among serious gamers for years and <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5326/">Amazon just dropped the price from $69 down to $37 as they clear out remaining stock</a>. This<strong> 46% discount</strong> brings one of the most respected gaming mice down to impulse-buy territory.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5326/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Precision That Matters in Games</h2>
<p>The Hero 25K sensor tracks with 1:1 accuracy over a range from 100 to 25,600 DPI, which means the cursor goes exactly where you want it without any smoothing, filtering, or acceleration messing with your muscle memory. High DPI settings let you make huge sweeping movements with tiny hand motions, perfect for fast-paced shooters where you need to whip around instantly. Lower DPI gives you pixel-perfect precision for sniping or editing work when you need that surgical control.</p>
<p>The adjustable weight system lets you change how the mouse feels in your hand by <strong>adding up to five 3.6-gram weights or taking them away</strong>. Some gamers like a light mouse to move quickly around, while some like it with more heft for stability and control. You’ll be able to try different weight configurations until you find what feels right for how you grip the mouse and what games you play.</p>



<p>The <strong>11 programmable buttons</strong> give you instant access to abilities, macros or commands without reaching for your keyboard. Map your most-used actions to thumb buttons, assign weapon switches to side clicks or set up complex macro sequences for MMOs and MOBAs. The <strong>onboard memory stores up to five profiles</strong> directly on the mouse so your settings follow you to LAN parties, friend’s houses, or tournament setups without needing to reinstall software.</p>
<p>The <strong>RGB lighting syncs with other Logitech G gear</strong> via Lightsync technology and lets you coordinate colors across your whole setup. You can match your team colors, set up reactive lighting that responds to in-game events or just pick colors that look good on your desk. The lighting isn’t just aesthetic either: you can set different colors for different DPI levels so you know at a glance which sensitivity you’re running.</p>
<p>The <strong>wired connection eliminates any sort of battery anxiety or input lag</strong> that a wireless mouse may introduce. You never have to stop mid-game to charge it, never have drops in connection during clutch moments, and never have to deal with added weight from batteries. The braided cable resists tangling and holds up better than its rubber-coated alternatives, which inevitably crack and fray.</p>
<p>For $37, this mouse is cheaper than going out to dinner but upgrades a piece of hardware you touch for hours every single day.</p>
