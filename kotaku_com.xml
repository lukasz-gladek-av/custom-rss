            <link>https://kotaku.com/dji-liquidates-its-mic-mini-at-a-record-low-noise-cancelling-and-hq-audio-now-cost-peanuts-2000639685</link>

              <p>Shooting high-quality video with exceptional vibrancy and just the right angles is just half the story. You need clean audio to get the message, excitement and even frustration across. Most cameras out there have built-in microphones but they are not always enough: If you want that professional audio that cuts through background chatter and reaches with exceptional clarity, it might be time <strong>for a proper wireless mic system</strong>.</p>
<p>DJI – one of our favorite go-to brands for cameras – also has a solid lineup of wireless microphones and we just spotted an option going for less. The DJI Mic Mini, <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5079/">which typically retails for $119, is now going for just $74 at Amazon, after a generous 38% discount</a>. It’s the lowest price we’ve seen in the past 30 days; even Prime Day didn’t bring it this low. We recommend grabbing it sooner rather than later, as the offer might wrap up anytime now.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5079/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Impressive Range With Two Noise Cancellation Modes</h2>
<p>This setup gives you two transmitters and one receiver, so it’s perfect for when you’re shooting with more than one user. Each transmitter is small, lightweight, and can be worn/clipped easily. It doesn’t feel bulky or look unpleasant on camera. Despite its tiny size, it offers a maximum transmission range of 400 meters for stronger signals both indoors and outdoors. Recording in those busy streets and jam-packed cafeterias won’t be a problem, ever again.</p>
<p>You’re also getting two noise cancellation modes; basic and strong. The basic mode is ideal for relatively quieter environments, like your home, while the strong mode is more appropriate for noisier settings. It also comes with an automatic limiting feature that reduces volume spikes and maintains a consistent tone; your audience won’t be hit with an unexpected jumpscare mid-video.</p>



<p>Battery-wise, you’re looking at up to 10 hours of operating time on both the transmitters and the receiver. This is more than enough for longer shoots, and you can even go a couple of days without plugging them in. The DJI Mic Mini also plays well with a wide range of devices. Even without the receiver, you can pair the transmittor with DJI devices like the Osmo Pocket 3 and Osmo Action 5 Pro.</p>
<p>In the box, you’ll find two transmitters, one receiver, a mobile adapter, a camera audio cable, clip magnets, windscreens, a charging dock, and a carrying pouch. Keep in mind that the offer might end soon, so it’s best to grab it fast.</p>

              <p>If I try to think of brands that appeal to everyone across all ages and gender, the one that pops into my mind front and center has got to be LEGO. Whether you’re a kid or just a kid at heart, there is joy to be found in building a LEGO set. Assembling LEGO bricks piece by piece, can be a mindful, rewarding, and enjoyable activity. Then by the send of it, you have some cool <em>Star Wars</em> or <em>Marvel</em> toy to play with or display on your shelf.</p>
<p>The only catch is that LEGO sets can get pretty pricey, and when they do actually go on sale, it’s usually not by a lot or it sells out almost immediately. That’s what when a big sale does kick in, it’s hard to pass it up. Right now, this LEGO Star Wars Ahsoka Tano set depicting the duel on Peridea has dropped in price:&nbsp;With the 40% off, <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5078/">you end up saving $22 as the price comes down to just $33 (down from $55) for a limited time</a>.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5078/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>From the <em>Star Wars: Ahsoka</em> Season 1 Finale</h2>
<p>There are too many Star Wars LEGO sets to count, and even a small handful depicting scenes from the recent Disney Plus show <em>Star Wars: Ahsoka</em>. This set portrays <strong>Ahsoka Tano’s duel on Peridea against Grand Admiral Thrawn’s army</strong> from the final episode of the show’s first season.</p>



<p>The <strong>382-piece set designed for ages eight and up</strong> includes five minifigures of characters from the show: We have <strong>Ahsoka Tano, Grand Admiral Thrawn, Morgan Elsbeth, Ezra Bridger and a Night Trooper</strong>. The buildable brick platform they fight on features three built-in turntables which can spin each minifigure allowing you to recreate their dynamic battle. You can even reenact Ezra’s leap off the platform with the launchpad.</p>
<p>The LEGO Builder app can help make the build even easier. View each step with a 3D digital version so you can get a better look at some of those weird angles that don’t print well in the instruction booklet. You can zoom in and rotate the model around even bookmark your progress so you can walkaway and come back later to complete your build.</p>
<p>Right now, the LEGO Star Wars Ahsoka Tano’s Duel on Peridea is discounted down to its lowest price yet of just $33.</p>
