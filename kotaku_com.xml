He says he’s “not dying out here” in the middle of the Seattle warzone. But the irony is that homeboy probably <em>is</em> dying out here, and in the next episode.</p><p>In the preview, we see a clip of Ellie (Bella Ramsey) and Jesse running up the aisle of the theater that the group has made into their home base while in Seattle. We don’t get any context as to what the pair is running toward, but anyone who’s played <em>The Last of Us Part II</em> knows what’s coming.</p><p>Jesse is another unfortunate casualty in Ellie and Abby’s revenge tour, and for a game that loves to drag out character deaths, his end is pretty quick, but no less brutal. As he and Ellie run into the theater lobby, Abby, who found the group’s hideout, shoots Jesse right in the face, killing him instantly. Based on the preview, it looks like this scene is in the finale, unless the show decides to handle Jesse’s fate differently.

How much is a game worth? What qualities or aspects of a game justify a higher price tag, or demand a lower one? Does a game that costs $70 deserve the same critical reaction as the identical game but $30? All this has gone on since time immemorial. But something that seems to rumble underneath so much of the discussion is rich people telling poor people that prices don’t matter. When asked about a potential $80 cost for <em>Borderlands 4</em>, multi-millionaire Randy Pitchford—CEO of developer Gearbox—told a potential customer, “If you’re a real fan, you’ll find a way to make it happen.”</p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="196163" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="Firefight’s Back In Halo!

In 1991 when he had just left high school and was working a minimum-wage job at an ice cream parlor on Pismo Beach, he was able to find a way to pay $80 for <em>Starflight</em> on the Sega Genesis. So, you know, so can everyone else. Pitchford sent the message as a reply on X last week, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.gamesradar.com/games/borderlands/gearbox-boss-randy-pitchford-says-its-not-my-call-if-borderlands-4-costs-usd80-but-if-youre-a-real-fan-youll-find-a-way-to-buy-it-anyway/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/borderlands/gearbox-boss-randy-pitchford-says-its-not-my-call-if-borderlands-4-costs-usd80-but-if-youre-a-real-fan-youll-find-a-way-to-buy-it-anyway/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">spotted by <em>GamesRadar</em> today</a></span>.</p><p>Randy Pitchford grew up in Fairfax, Virginia, then California. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://web.archive.org/web/20190112044349/https://www.kotaku.com.au/2012/05/randy-pitchford-and-the-perfect-shuffle/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20190112044349/https://www.kotaku.com.au/2012/05/randy-pitchford-and-the-perfect-shuffle/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">His father worked in U.S. intelligence</a></span> in the 1970s, and his house was filled with all manner of technology throughout his childhood. While I cannot say for sure (although I have emailed to find out), it seems vanishingly unlikely that Pitchford was living off of his minimum wage ice cream job after he’d graduated high school, as his tweet seems to want to heavily imply. Pitchford soon after went to UCLA, so we can quite safely guess that this was a short-term job, one for earning a bit of extra spending money while still living at home with his parents.</p><p>I would suggest that to use this anecdote to explain to all living humans that if they really want a copy of <em>Borderlands 4</em>, they can easily find eighty bucks to spare is grotesque. It kind of makes me sick.</p><h2 id="h342314"><a id=""></a>Luxury viewpoints</h2><p>“Video games are a luxury.” That’s a point many people want to make in situations like this. “If you can afford the console to play the game on...” people might begin, as they argue that you can’t really be <em>that</em> poor if you can still afford entertainment. All those people living on welfare, but with those giant TVs, etc. It’s a fascinating perspective, almost exclusively proffered by those who <em>aren’t</em> living on welfare, and have rarely truly wanted for anything. Because if there’s one thing that’s pretty damned desirable when you’re living in real poverty, it’s some option for positive entertainment. For so many others, furiously working and saving and scraping together the money to be able to buy their children a games console, to give them that one thing they so desperately want when they’ve had to go without so much else, is not an act of opulence but of enormous sacrifice.</p><p>So no, this isn’t about abstract situations made up by armchair philosophers trying to justify Pitchford’s claim by arguing that any truly poor person have to choose between food or games entirely. This is about reality, where a person might go without so much extra food, or only buy the very cheapest food, so that they can pull together the $60 that year to buy the new entry in their favorite gaming franchise. That little bit of light. And then they find out it’s maybe now going to cost $80 instead.</p><h2 id="h342315"><a id=""></a>For 37 million Americans, there <em>isn’t</em> an extra $20</h2><p>In 2023 (<span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.census.gov/library/publications/2024/demo/p60-283.html&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.census.gov/library/publications/2024/demo/p60-283.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">the most recent data</a></span>), <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2023/03/09/magazine/poverty-by-america-matthew-desmond.html&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/03/09/magazine/poverty-by-america-matthew-desmond.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">23 percent</a></span> of Americans worked in low-wage jobs.

An example of “poverty” was given as “a family of three with income below $21,559.” In 2025, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://aspe.hhs.gov/topics/poverty-economic-mobility/poverty-guidelines&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://aspe.hhs.gov/topics/poverty-economic-mobility/poverty-guidelines" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">the Department of Health and Human Services</a></span> describes poverty for an individual as living on less than $15,650 a year. This is all before the recent raids on welfare. </p><p>That breaks down to $1,300 a month. The average rental price for a one-bedroom apartment in the United States is <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.apartments.com/rent-market-trends/us/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.apartments.com/rent-market-trends/us/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">$1,625 a month</a></span>. The average monthly household expenses for a single person <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.ramseysolutions.com/budgeting/american-average-monthly-expenses&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.ramseysolutions.com/budgeting/american-average-monthly-expenses" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">come to $4,641</a></span>, including food, insurance, rent, cell phone, internet, and personal care. Even taking into account that these are averages, it’s pretty obvious that when you’re one of the one-in-nine people living on $1,300 a month, you don’t have a lot of spare piles of $80. In 2012 (soon after the crash), <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.npr.org/sections/money/2012/08/01/157664524/how-the-poor-the-middle-class-and-the-rich-spend-their-money&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.npr.org/sections/money/2012/08/01/157664524/how-the-poor-the-middle-class-and-the-rich-spend-their-money" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">it was reported that the poorest people in America spent 98 percent of their income</a></span>, with one dollar per day to save. That study showed this group spends 4.8 percent of their income on “entertainment,” a broad category that even includes pets. An $80 copy of <em>Borderlands 4 </em>is 6.2 percent of $1,300.</p><p>Jump forward to the pre-covid boom in 2019, and on an annual family household income of $25,525, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://engaging-data.com/household-spending-income/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://engaging-data.com/household-spending-income/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">total spending is measured to be $25,525</a></span>. Of that, for an average family in this bracket, a total of $1,270 is spent on “entertainment.” That’s roughly $105 a month. But, again, it’s essential to understand that “entertainment” includes all sporting activities, all children’s extra-curricular education, toys, bikes, every electronic item from a TV to a camera, and even musical instruments and pets. If you own a dog, you’ll know that $105 a month could be taken up by it alone.</p><p>For so many of us, finding another $20 to buy a favorite game means grumbling and pulling out our wallet. But for so many others, it means not buying the one game we were hoping to play this year.</p><h2 id="h342316"><a id=""></a>“But if you’re a real fan...”</h2><p>Hopefully, this context suggests why it’s just so revolting for a man <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/gearbox-has-been-bought-for-1-3-billion-1846186922&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/gearbox-has-been-bought-for-1-3-billion-1846186922">who sold his company for a potential $1.3 billion in 2021</a></span> to tell someone on X that “if you’re a real fan, you’ll find a way to make it happen.” Because, you know, when he was doing a summer job at the beach in California, he somehow pulled enough cash together for that game he wanted.</p><p>It’s gross. It sucks. I’m fed up of it. I’m sick of rich people telling poor people that they can find the money if they just try hard enough. I’ve had my fill of people who’ve never known hunger, never struggled to pay a bill, flippantly dismissing the concept that life is extremely tough for millions and millions of people. It’s the rhetoric that allows for the myth of the “welfare queen” to be so readily accepted, to assume that the poorest people just aren’t pulling their weight or working hard enough, that if these people were <em>really</em> poor, they wouldn’t be playing video games at all. It’s <em>hateful</em>.</p><p>As for whether <em>Borderlands 4</em> will cost $80, Pitchford claims it’s “not my call,” <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/borderlands-4-price-preorders-randy-pitchford-pax-east-1851780045&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/borderlands-4-price-preorders-randy-pitchford-pax-east-1851780045">having previously said it’s still undecided</a></span>.
