              <p>Later this year, <em>PUBG: Battlegrounds</em> will end support on PlayStation 4 and Xbox One after eight years of service as the developers focus on improving the game on current-gen hardware.</p> <p>On August 13, the development studio behind the extremely popular online battle royale game <em>PUBG: Battlegrounds</em> announced that the multiplayer shooter will no longer be playable on PS4 or Xbox One after November 13. The first console port of <em>PUBG</em> arrived in late 2017 on Xbox One and was followed by a PS4 port the next year. According to the team behind <em>PUBG</em>, sharing this news with players “weighs heavily on” the team.</p> <p>“This was not a decision made lightly,” said the <em>PUBG</em> team in a blog post sharing the news. “It comes after long and careful consideration, in pursuit of the continued growth and long-term future of <em>PUBG</em> Console. We kindly ask for your understanding.”</p> <p>The devs claim the reason for ending support on PS4 and Xbox One after nearly a decade comes down to the team wanting to improve the game’s performance, visuals, and stability on console. The team also knows players have long dealt with the game crashing and hope this new version of <em>PUBG</em> on Xbox Series X/S and PS5 won’t collapse as often.</p>

 <p>Players on PS4 and Xbox One should be able to log into a new console and find all of their account progress and purchased items waiting for them. PS5 users will have to download a new version of <em>PUBG</em>. Meanwhile, on Xbox, the game will be updated automatically via Smart Delivery. The new version of <em>PUBG</em> will support 60FPS on all platforms, including Xbox Series S, though at a lower resolution on that device. (Players on Xbox’s weaker console can select a quality mode that runs at 30FPS as well.)</p> <p data-renderer-start-pos="9191">“This transition to current-gen consoles is not only aimed at providing a more stable environment, but also at preparing for larger updates in the future,” said the devs.&nbsp; “It marks an important step forward for the long-term growth of <em>PUBG</em> Console, and will allow us to respond more swiftly to the evolving needs of the console ecosystem. We sincerely thank you for your continued interest and support in <em>PUBG</em> Console, and we remain committed to providing you with the best possible gameplay experience going forward.”</p>

              <p><em>Spider-Man Remastered</em> will once again be free for paid PS Plus subscribers to play when the hit open-world superhero adventure returns to the service later this month. In fact, August is looking like another decent haul for the Game Pass competitor, with<em> Mortal Kombat 1</em> and<em> Resident Evil</em> PS1 classics also joining the fray.</p> <p><em>Spider-Man</em> had originally been on the service’s subscription library until it was removed in April 2023 <a href="https://kotaku.com/playstation-ps5-marvels-spider-man-ps-plus-extra-ps4-1850328471">shortly before the sequel was released for PS5</a>. Originally going head-to-head with Microsoft’s Game Pass strategy, which included day-one first-party exclusives, it’s no longer a guarantee that Sony games will cycle into PS Plus library and stay there even years after they’ve released. <a href="https://kotaku.com/ps5-ps-plus-may-2025-gta-5-resistance-batman-1851778091"><em>Horizon Zero Dawn</em></a> exited just last year ahead of its own remaster arriving.</p> <p>Here’s the <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/08/13/playstation-plus-game-catalog-for-august-mortal-kombat-1-marvels-spider-man-sword-of-the-sea-earth-defense-force-6-and-more/">full list</a> of games joining the PS Plus Extra tier in August 2025:</p> <ul> <li><em>Mortal Kombat 1</em> | PS5</li> <li><em>Marvel’s Spider-Man</em> | PS5, PS4</li> <li><em>Sword of the Sea</em> | PS5</li> <li><em>Earth Defense Force 6</em> | PS5, PS4</li> <li><em>Unicorn Overlord</em> | PS5, PS4</li> <li><em>Atelier Ryza 3 Alchemist of the End &amp; the Secret Key</em> | PS5, PS4</li> <li><em>Indika</em> | PS5</li> <li><em>Harold Halibut</em> | PS5</li> <li><em>Coral Island</em> | PS5And here’s what’s joining the Premier tier:</li> <li><em>Resident Evil 2</em> | PS5, PS4 (PS)</li> <li><em>Resident Evil 3: Nemesis</em> | PS5, PS4 (PS)</li> <li><em>Death Stranding 2: On the Beach</em> free game trial | PS5Everything will become available starting August 19, including <em>Sword of the Sea</em> which is a day-and-date release. It’s the latest atmospheric adventure from Giant Squid, which also made <em>Abzu</em> and <em>The Pathless</em>, one of the PS5’s more underrated launch games. <em>Sword of the Sea</em> has a lot of Journey-style dune surfing in it so I’m excited to check it out.There are some <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/PlayStationPlus/comments/1m16p8q/games_leaving_ps_extradeluxepremium_on_august_19th/">notable games leaving PS Plus</a> on that day as well, however. <em>The Witcher 3: The Wild Hunt</em> is ending its latest tour on PS Plus, and 2023’s excellent <em>Monster Hunter</em>-like <em>Wild Hearts</em> will be departing as well. <em>Star Wars: Jedi Survivor</em>, <em>UFC 5</em>, <em>TopSpin 2K25,</em> and<em> Bugsnax</em> will all be gone as well.</li> </ul>
