              <p>Halloween is a great time to rewatch the classics like Harry Potter, and what better way to relive your favorite moments than with a fun Lego build? Lego has quite a few Harry Potter sets to choose from, but if you’re after something that’s easy to make and doesn’t cost too much, the Aragog in the Forbidden Forest set is a great option to consider.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4814/">It normally runs you around $20, but Amazon is offering it for just $16 after a sweet 20% discount.</a> You’re saving $4 on this budget build that’s fun to work on, and also makes a great gift for any Harry Potter fan out there.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4814/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Bring Your Favorite Scenes to Life</h2>
<p>This set comes with 195 pieces and is appropriate for ages 7 and above. You’re getting Harry Potter and Ron Weasley minifigures with two wands and a lantern to guide them through the forest. You can choose between happy or scared faces, depending on the scene you’re trying to recreate. Though honestly, a scared Weasley feels a lot more fitting than a happy one.</p>
<p>There’s a fairly big Aragog figure, whose legs, fangs, and pedipalps are all movable, so you can create your own dramatic setups. The Aragog figure measures about 2.5 inches high, 6 inches long, and 7 inches wide. Plus, you’ve also got a small buildable forest section with plants, a spider web, and two baby spider figures. There’s a lot of room for creativity, so this set is sure to keep your little ones (or you) engaged for the weekend.</p>



<p>The included instruction manual guides you through the building process step-by-step. If that seems a bit too complicated, you can install the Lego Builder app on your phone. It lets you zoom in on the blocks, rotate your sets in 3D, and track your progress in real time.</p>
<p>If you’re a Harry Potter fan and want to introduce your kids to the wizarding world too, this Lego set is a great way to get started. It’s going to be a fun weekend project, and can also look great as a display piece. If you already own a set or two, place it with the rest of your collection to build your own version of magical adventures. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4814/">This set was already quite affordable at $20, but this deal brings it down to just $16.</a> The discount, however, might not last too long, so we suggest hurrying to grab it.</p>

But you… isn’t it a bit too soon? Didn’t you say you were going to defeat me someday?

            <title><![CDATA[Dell’s OptiPlex 7020 Mini PC Falls 71%, From 6× the Price of a Mac Mini to Clearance-Level Pricing]]></title>
            <link>https://kotaku.com/the-only-thing-skinnier-than-this-powerhouse-dell-desktop-is-its-71-off-amazon-deal-2000635765</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/dell%E2%80%99s-optiplex-7020-mini-pc-falls-71-from-6%C3%97-the-price-of-a-mac-mini-to-clearance-level-pricing.1326439/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Maybe you’re still unconvinced by the recent wave of mini PCs, but you’re still not willing to plop a full-sized PC tower onto your desk, or even under it. Here’s a massive new Amazon deal on a desktop PC that’s slightly bigger than the other minis, way smaller than the towers, and quite possibly blows them both all of the water when it comes to performance. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4813/">The skinny Dell Optiplex 7020 is a fat 71% off at just $996.</a></p>
<p>The heart and brains of the Optiplex 7020 is the 14th-gen Intel Core i7-14700T processor that delivers enough power to handle all of your productivity tasks and even some creative ones too, and it can do so at sizzling speeds of up to 5.2GHz. There’s also 32GB of RAM and a 1TB hard drive inside the slender sub-2-inches-wide body, along with enough ports so it can easily handle being the centerpiece of your home workstation.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4813/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Mini In Name Only</h2>
<p>Dell calls the Optiplex 7020 a “mini PC,” but it’s a weight class or two above the palm-sized PCs that have been all the rage lately. Still, at just 7 inches high and 7 inches long, and just 1.42 inches thick, it definitely qualifies as portable, and can even be mounted on the back of a monitor for ultimate space-saving efficiency. You might have to choose which monitor to mount it behind, though, because the Dell Optiplex 7020 can support up to 3 displays at 4K resolution.</p>
<p>Performance-wise, there’s nothing “mini” about the Optiplex 7020, with all of that memory and Intel processing power driving the pre-installed Windows 11 Professional. The Intel UHD Graphics 770 chip will have all three of those 4K monitors looking crisp, if you so choose, in which case you’ll have plenty of visual real estate to put Microsoft Copilot to work as your AI assistant.</p>



<h2>All Your Hookups</h2>
<p>The HDMI 1.4b and two DisplayPort 1.4a outputs handle the external monitor situation more than amply, and there are also two USB-C 3.2 Gen 2 ports, a USB-A 3.2 Gen 2, and a USB-A 3.2 Gen 1 to satisfy all of your expansion and peripheral needs. The Ethernet RJ-45 port will give you outstanding hardwired internet speed, but it also has Wi-Fi 6 to keep your online work and play moving at a nice clip.</p>
<p>Dell’s foray into the small-PC world originally showed up at Amazon with a bloated $3,399 price tag that we wouldn’t recommend in a million years, <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4813/">but with that number slashed down by 71% to just $996</a>, the Optiplex 7020 is a solid buy as a high-powered performance desktop PC that happens to be shrunk down to portable size.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[This 15″ Portable Monitor Turns Your Nintendo Switch Into a Big-Screen Console for Pocket Change]]></title>
            <link>https://kotaku.com/this-15-portable-monitor-turns-your-nintendo-switch-into-a-big-screen-console-for-pocket-change-2000635990</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/this-15%E2%80%B3-portable-monitor-turns-your-nintendo-switch-into-a-big-screen-console-for-pocket-change.1326373/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>The Nintendo Switch’s built-in screen is fine for quick sessions on the couch, but squinting at that 6.2-inch display during long gaming marathons gets old fast. The <em>MNN</em> <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3766/">15.6-inch portable monitor has dropped to an all-time low of $59 on Amazon, down from $89</a>, and it transforms your handheld console into something that feels closer to a proper gaming setup without sacrificing portability.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3766/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<p>What’s especially desirable about the monitor in its own right, is its real plug-and-play ease: The <strong>dual USB-C receptacles let you connect your Switch with one cable</strong> that handles power and video signal simultaneously. Not a distinct power brick in play, no HDMI converter to carry around but one cable from the Switch dock to the monitor.</p>
<h2>Why Size and Portability Actually Matter</h2>
<p>The <strong>15.6-inch display produces 1920×1080 Full HD resolution</strong> which is an enormous leap from the Switch’s native display at 1280×720. Text becomes crisper, game worlds display more detail and the experience becomes more immersive in general. The IPS panel technology allows for stable colors and<strong> clarity throughout a 178-degree viewing angle</strong> so you can see the display from the side without the colors washing out or contrast changing. The large viewing angle becomes beneficial in the case that you’re playing with friends huddled around a small table.</p>



<p>The screen’s <strong>matte finish cuts down glare from ceiling lights or windows</strong> which becomes essential in rooms you can’t completely control. Glossy screens are wonderful in lightless rooms but become mirrors in well-lit rooms. The diffusing effect the matte coating gives this MNN monitor prevents the picture from being obscured in well-lit rooms such as coffee houses, air terminal lounges, or sunlit hotel rooms.</p>
<p>Internal speakers reduce one cable and device from your carry-on equipment. Audio quality won’t be the same as with dedicated gaming headsets but the fact that you can have audio without the added hardware makes spontaneous gaming sessions easier. Speakers are loud enough for personal use in quiet spaces and headphones can always be plugged in via your Switch if you want superior audio or prefer the stealth.</p>



<p><strong>HDR support improves compatible games</strong> with increased contrast and wider range of colors. Games developed with HDR in view feature brighter highlights and richer shadows at the same time, and the result is more visual complexity. The contrast becomes particularly apparent in highly lit games such as Breath of the Wild or neo-noir games where atmosphere relies so highly on light and shadow interaction.</p>
<p>The monitor weighs <strong>a little more than two pounds and less than half an inch thick</strong>, so it can fit in laptop bags or backpacks right next to your Switch. The built-in smart cover shields the display in transport and doubles as a stand that tilts the monitor up at a comfortable viewing angle. Since the stand solution is built right in, you’re not searching for something to prop the monitor up against or wrestling with a standalone kickstand accessory.</p>
<p>At $59, this is fantastic value for a transportable display which really enhances your mobile gaming experience.</p>
