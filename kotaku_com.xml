              <p>Xbox Game Pass Ultimate just shot up another 50%, jumping from $20 to $30 per month. Folks are canceling subscriptions left and right with reports of the web page to change you Microsoft subscription plan going down due to overwhelming traffic. $30 every month for a service is a bad price. Microsoft should know better, but not all of their services are that excruciating on your wallet. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4452/">Right now, you can upgrade to Windows 11 Pro for just $10. StackSocial has it marked down from $199 by 94% for a limited time.</a> It’s a one time upgrade too. No subscription, just pay for the license once and you got it.</p>
<p>Windows 11 Pro offers a whole slew of new security features and an updated UI designed for multitaskers.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4452/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at StackSocial</a></p>

<h2>New Features to Maximize Your Productivity</h2>
<p>Universal Search has been added to the taskbar. This new tool allows you to search for anything, pretty much anywhere. Doesn’t matter if you’re looking for a specific file on your computer or need a recipe or directions from the internet, the search will look through all systems to pull up precisely what you need — all with just one search bar.</p>
<p>Windows 11 Pro gives you OneDrive support. You can synchronize preferences and files across your different devices, accessing them from anywhere. Say an urgent email comes through in which you need to reply to immediately with an attachment. Or perhaps you forgot to submit the paper you wrote, but now you’re sitting in class without your laptop. You can pull up OneDrive on your phone and submit from there. Easy-peasy. It’s a great tool to have while traveling too.</p>



<p>Desktop is a terrific, albeit a poorly-named feature. Like c’mon. Desktop already has a definition. Use something new. Anyway, ‘Desktop’ allows you to set up customized workspaces on your PC. Tailor your wallpaper, shortcuts, logins, widgets, and more for your different needs. Have one set up for gaming, another for student activities, perhaps another for a side hustle. You can then easily swap between them right at the taskbar.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4452/">Windows 11 Pro has built-in all sorts of keyboard shortcuts you may not know about</a>. Have you ever used Win + V? It’s kind of like Ctrl + V on steroids. Instead of just pasting the last thing you copied, it will pull up your clipboard and history of all your recent copies. This is a complete game change for any workflow that requires a lot of copying and pasting, like if you need to move multiple bits of info into a form you’re filling out or perhaps a spreadsheet. No need to flip back and forth between your tabs, copying and pasting one item at a time.</p>

              <p>We’re inching closer to the second Prime Day of the year, and it’s a great time to invest in smart home devices. Amazon has started the celebration early, and we’ve just spotted the newest Amazon Echo Show 8 going for $100 on it.</p>
<p>It’s a straightforward $50 discount – no coupon codes required. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4450/">Even better, if you already own an Echo device, you can trade it in for an extra 20% off on top of the discount.</a> The offer is available on both black and white color options, but it ends soon, so you might want to act fast to grab it.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4450/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Improved Screen, Better Sound</h2>
<p>Echo Shows have always been more than just great displays. This one packs a stunning 8-inch HD touchscreen that pushes vibrant, true-to-life visuals. The screen is paired with room-filling spatial audio, so there’s no need for external speakers to enjoy great sound, whether you’re watching a video or just vibing to your favorite song. There’s support for Netflix, Prime Video, Fire TV Channels, and more, so entertainment options are also plenty.</p>
<p>The solid 13 MP front camera with auto-framing keeps you centered during video calls, while built-in noise reduction makes sure you’re heard clearly on the other end. Of course, smart home compatibility is top-notch. Those with devices that support Zigbee, Matter, or Thread can pair and control them directly using just their voice. Need to dim the lights, but five steps to the switch feel like two miles? Just ask Echo Show to handle it. Doorbell just rang, and you want to see who’s there without getting up? Say the word.</p>



<p>And when not in use, Echo Show 8 smartly doubles as a digital picture frame, so you can keep your favorite moments close! You also have the option to invite your family and friends to share photos on the device – a great way to stay connected.</p>
<p>Setting up the whole thing and getting started is fairly simple. It sits well pretty much anywhere, but if you want better angles or prefer it at eye level, you might want to invest in a dedicated stand (sold separately). All in all, the Echo Show 8 brings a lot of convenience to your day-to-day tasks, especially if you’re looking to manage all your smart home devices in one place. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4450/">This version brings better video and sound quality, and can now be yours for just $100. Be sure to grab it before it’s too late.</a></p>

              <p>Why is GameStop torching its business partner on social media? Can unionization help the studio behind <em>Disco Elysium</em>&nbsp;pull out of a rough couple of years? And what is one of the first people to get their Xbox Ally Rog handheld in the mail saying about it? It’s another edition of Morning Checkpoint, <em>Kotaku</em>‘s daily roundup of gaming news and culture. Take a stroll down memory lane with this excerpt from then-chairman of Sony Interactive Entertainment Shawn Layden’s speech at E3 2014. “It really stuck with me as the thing that makes PlayStation so appealing,”<em> Souls</em> archeologist Lance McDonald <a href="https://x.com/manfightdragon/status/1333259098180046855">wrote in a thread</a> that’s been circulating again recently.</p> <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">6 years ago <a href="https://twitter.com/ShawnLayden?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@ShawnLayden</a> delivered this mostly forgotten speech for PlayStation at E3, which for some reason it really stuck with me as the thing that makes PlayStation so appealing. The CEO saying "It wasn't a multi-million seller, but that wasn't the point" at the time was nice <a href="https://t.co/iK6KdnXm4w">pic.twitter.com/iK6KdnXm4w</a></p> <p>— Lance McDonald (@manfightdragon) <a href="https://twitter.com/manfightdragon/status/1333259098180046855?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 30, 2020</a></p></blockquote>  <h2>The <em>Payday</em> studio is killing its <em>D&amp;D</em> project to focus more on <em>Payday</em></h2> <p>Project Baxter was a “co-op urban crawl through a reactive <em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons </em>world, utilizing procedural tools to enhance emergent gameplay in an endlessly replayable setting.” It is no more. Starbreeze announced the project has been canceled&nbsp; as it pivots to focusing exclusively on its multiplayer heist franchise.</p>

 <p>“This was a difficult but necessary decision,”&nbsp;CEO Adolf Kristjansson <a href="https://corporate.starbreeze.com/en/press/press-releases/starbreeze-sharpens-focus-on-payday-franchise-baxter-discontinued-as-part-of-strategic-shift/">said in a statement</a>. “Our strategy is clear: PAYDAY is one of the most iconic IPs in gaming, with unmatched reach and potential. By focusing our investment and talent here, we can accelerate delivery, engage players with more content, and reinforce Starbreeze’s position as the clear leader in the heisting genre. This is about sharpening our focus to create the strongest long-term value for our players, our people, and our shareholders.”</p>

 <h2>Devs at <em>Disco Elysium</em> studio ZA/UM just unionized</h2> <p>The group will be represented by the Independent Workers Union of Great Britain (IWGB) and meet regularly with studio management to discuss workplace issues, <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/after-layoffs-cancellations-and-controversy-zaum-uk-staff-unionise-as-the-workers-alliance"><em>GamesIndustry.biz</em>&nbsp;reports</a>. The change comes after the cancellation of a <em>Disco Elysium</em> sequel, multiple rounds of layoffs, and an acrimonious split with the original game’s leads.</p>

 <p>“It’s been a super turbulent couple of years,” Poppy Ingham told <em>GamesIndustry.biz</em>. “Oh God, you’d open Slack and you wouldn’t know if you were expecting to see another podcast about the studio. You had no idea what was going to happen.” ZA/UM revealed a trailer for its next RPG, <em>Zero Parades for Spies</em>, <a href="https://kotaku.com/state-of-play-playstation-5-sony-stream-youtube-twitch-2000628258">at Sony’s most recent State of Play</a>.</p>

 <h2>GameStop claims it will keep Game Pass prices lower, for now</h2> <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">We will continue to sell Xbox Game Pass Ultimate for $19.99/month in-store and online. <a href="https://t.co/EAPGaud7cY">pic.twitter.com/EAPGaud7cY</a></p> <p>— GameStop (@gamestop) <a href="https://twitter.com/gamestop/status/1973510724170424405?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 1, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <p>The <em>Pokémon-</em>card-trading house masquerading as a video game retailer used Microsoft’s Game Pass price hike announcement to chase clout and win back disaffected gamers who forget how much they once hated trading in games they paid full price for in exchange for pennies on the dollar. “We will continue to sell Xbox Game Pass Ultimate for $19.99/month in-store and online,” it posted <a href="https://x.com/gamestop/status/1973510724170424405">on X</a>. That was after several <a href="https://x.com/gamestop/status/1973439369680920744">viral posts</a> dunking on the latest Xbox move. <em>Kotaku</em> reached out to GameStop for clarification on how long this offer will last.</p>

 <h2><em>Dune: Awakening</em> dev is laying people off despite a huge launch</h2> <p>Funcom called the desert survival crafting MMO “the biggest release we’ve had in our 32-year-long history of making great games,” but added that it now has begin the “difficult process” of laying some people off as it pivots toward a console launch next year. <em>Dune: Awakening</em> debuted at over 100,000 concurrent players on Steam back in July and has been releasing steady updates for Early Access ever since.</p>

 <p>“The transition from development to long-term live operation, while also building towards a major console release next year, will require us to restructure our teams and focus our resources from across projects and studios. Unfortunately, this also means having to say goodbye to cherished colleagues,” the studio <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/dune-awakening-developer-funcom-announces-redundancies">told <em>GamesIndustry.biz</em></a> in a statement.</p> <h2>Someone got their $1000 Xbox handheld early</h2> <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">Amazon France has accidentally shipped an Xbox Ally X early to a Reddit user 🙃 <a href="https://t.co/iTofLme10L">https://t.co/iTofLme10L</a> <a href="https://t.co/Qh3Jc6N9YX">pic.twitter.com/Qh3Jc6N9YX</a></p> <p>— Tom Warren (@tomwarren) <a href="https://twitter.com/tomwarren/status/1973156450664058891?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">September 30, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <p>“It’s a good console,” wrote TechnicalFun77 on the Asus Rog Ally subreddit (via <em><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/this-guy-got-rog-xbox-ally-x-early-thanks-to-amazons-mistake/1100-6535158/">GameSpot</a></em>). “Very good ergonomics, controlled weight, pretty nice handheld, armory crate in the full screen experience is very responsive, no latency problem when pressing buttons, quite fluid in the menus in general, and superb battery life at 17-25w. And my god, the console is quiet and well-cooled even at high TDP. One of the main strengths is the sound of the device. It [feels] like the sounds are going all around my head, I almost don’t need headphones.” The post has since been nuked.</p> <h2>Daredevil and the first step toward cross-platform progression come to <em>Marvel Rivals </em>this month</h2> <p>Season 4.5 is called Heart of the Dragon and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iV8lE08wGoE">arrives on October 10</a> with the defense-attorney-turned-crime-fighter as well as testing for the ability to carry your account unlocks between platforms. Cross-platform progression will only be open to a few players at first before it’s expanded to everyone. Meanwhile, <a href="https://x.com/MarvelRivals/status/1973463090357272875">a fresh balance patch</a> is hitting the hero shooter today.</p> <h2>ICYMI:</h2> <ul> <li><a href="https://kotaku.com/no-mans-sky-corvette-ship-build-voyagers-update-star-wars-2000630689"><em>No Man’s Sky</em> players are making some of the coolest-looking ships ever thanks to its big 2025 update</a></li> <li><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-card-tcg-vendor-scalper-reseller-stream-shows-2000630658"><em>Pokémon</em> collecting isn’t all scummy scalpers.
