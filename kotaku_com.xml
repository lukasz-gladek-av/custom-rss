Shields dominated the Tank meta early in <em>Overwatch</em>, mostly due to their immense health pool. However, in <em>Marvel Rivals</em>, the strongest shield has less than half the hit points of <em>Overwatch</em>’s original Reinhardt shield (2,000 compared to 800). These Tanks focus more on diving in and disrupting the enemy. Across <em>Marvel Rivals</em>’ vast roster of heroes, these are the two Vanguard characters who stand out the most.</p><h2 id="h635453"><a id="venom"></a>Venom is an easy-to-learn menace</h2><figure id="" data-id="f6bc745f60b4ca835c873382fdaf7de1" data-recommend-id="image://f6bc745f60b4ca835c873382fdaf7de1" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Venom leans back with his tongue hanging out." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Venom leans back with his tongue hanging out." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Marvel Games / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="f6bc745f60b4ca835c873382fdaf7de1" data-recommend-id="image://f6bc745f60b4ca835c873382fdaf7de1" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Venom leans back with his tongue hanging out." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p><em>Marvel Rivals</em>’ tanks focus much more on diving and disrupting than just soaking damage in the front line. And no one can dive in and distract the opposition quite like Spidey’s frenemy, Venom. His web-swinging is a perfectly suited movement ability, letting him charge and really make a splash on any objective. His attacks may feel a little weak, but his best strength is survivability, making him a perfect Tank.</p><p>The most important tool in Venom’s kit is the Symbiotic Resilience ability . This move grants Venom a temporary shield based on the amount of health he’s lost. Popping this ability can nearly double Venom’s health pool, making it a perfect move for turning the tables on your enemy.

Instead of tanking damage by diving or putting up shields, Peni can hunker down in one spot and effectively prevent the enemy from advancing. Using both webs and mines, she can make the objective hard to invade while giving herself bonus health.</p><p>Additionally, Peni can tether herself to her webs, ensuring that opportunistic Duelists can’t knock her too far from the objective. This can also be used to push far into enemy lines, only to pull back when things get dire. While Peni is best on defense, this ability gives her some offensive utility as well.</p><p>Overall, Peni Parker is annoying as hell to fight against. Hopefully, she’s annoying your opponents instead of you.</p><hr><p><em>Marvel Rivals</em> is available on PS5, Xbox Series X/S, and Windows via Steam.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

While the new design is still intended to make it an Xbox Series X/S controller for people who want the ergonomics of a  DualSense gamepad, this time around it looks far more like a DualSense, featuring a separated d-pad, a mic mute button, and more PS5-like triggers and colors. </p><p>Here’s a slick-looking trailer for the upcoming PlayStation-styled Xbox controller via <em>IGN</em>: </p><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/6/24335156/hyperkins-new-xbox-controller-looks-like-a-ps5-dualsense&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/6/24335156/hyperkins-new-xbox-controller-looks-like-a-ps5-dualsense" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">According to Hyperkin via <em>The Verge</em></a></span>, this new controller will be wired only and will include <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.techradar.com/gaming/hall-effect-technology-explained-the-gold-standard-for-your-controllers-thumbsticks-and-triggers&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.techradar.com/gaming/hall-effect-technology-explained-the-gold-standard-for-your-controllers-thumbsticks-and-triggers" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Hall Effect thumb sticks,</a></span> which should mean you won’t experience the dreaded stick drift effect just a few months after buying it. (This is a feature that standard Xbox and PS5 controllers don’t have!) The upcoming controller also features two programable back buttons. You’ll be able to use The Competitor on Xbox consoles as well as your PC. </p><p>Hyperkin didn’t reveal a price point, but I’d expect something in the $60 to $100 range. The controller company says its PS5-like Xbox gamepad will be available later this year. </p><p>Being able to use The Competitor on PC is nice, as a lot of games still don’t include PS button icons when you’re using a PlayStation controller. This should, in theory, act like an Xbox controller when plugged into Steam, but it will feel like a PlayStation controller when using it. Just don’t get confused about which X button to hit when a QTE prompt appears! </p><p> .<br></p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Yes, it’s an excellent platformer in its own right, but it’s also tugging on the heartstrings of everyone who’s ever owned a PlayStation console. While you run, jump, climb, and skate through <em>Astro Bot</em>’s many planets, you find robotic versions of characters from throughout PlayStation’s history. This collectathon is at the core of every platforming challenge you navigate, and you likely have memories associated with at least a handful of the bots you rescue if you’ve ever played a PlayStation-exclusive game. </p><p>Nothing quite beats finding your favorites scattered across the galaxy. Rescuing Sly Cooper from a jail cell, where he’s presumably been placed for his kleptomaniac crimes; playing as a robotic version of <em>God of War</em>’s Kratos; and seeing Joel from <em>The Last of Us </em>labeled as a “Dependable Smuggler” who “tells the occasional white lie” are the kind of referential bits that makes <em>Astro Bot </em>delightful. </p></div></div><div><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/hades-2-early-access-review-1851496575&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/hades-2-early-access-review-1851496575"><em>Hades 2</em></a></span> keeps its predecessor’s stylish reimagining of Greek mythology going with a boss fight against Scylla and the Sirens. Portrayed as a rock band who fight with their music, the Scylla and the Sirens boss fight is a challenging battle and an impressive display of sound design. The music correlates with the attacks the Sirens use, and if you take one out, their instrument will disappear from the backing track. Each foe you take down strips the song of its violent texture until all that’s left is deafening silence. <em>Hades 2 </em>is still in Early Access, and if the rest of the game is on the level of the Scylla fight, Supergiant has another hit on its hands.</p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="afpvuwnfoibrncd6upmy" data-recommend-id="image://afpvuwnfoibrncd6upmy" data-format="png" data-width="800" data-height="88" data-lightbox="false" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><span data-id="afpvuwnfoibrncd6upmy" data-recommend-id="image://afpvuwnfoibrncd6upmy" data-format="png" data-width="800" data-height="88" data-lightbox="false" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Some of <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/dragon-age-veilguard-4-review-dreadwolf-rook-action-rpg-1851681954&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/dragon-age-veilguard-4-review-dreadwolf-rook-action-rpg-1851681954"><em>Dragon Age: The Veilguard</em>’s</a></span> best moments are hidden and completely optional. That includes a conversation with Mythal, an elven god who has become an important figure in the <em>Dragon Age</em> universe ever since the series dove into elven history in 2014’s <em>Dragon Age: Inquisition</em>. The opportunity to reach Mythal in <em>The Veilguard </em>is buried under a collectathon, multiple sidequests, and a few group therapy sessions as your party unpacks some massive lore bombs. By the time you actually reach her, it’s made very clear that you’re unraveling the very fabric of the <em>Dragon Age </em>universe, and you’d best tread lightly.</p><p>Mythal can either be a willing ally or a begrudging asset by the end of your conversation with her. You can gain her favor in multiple different ways depending on your character’s background and what they’ve accomplished in their journey thus far. I’ve yet to talk to two people who recruited her in the same way, and it’s one of the few examples in <em>The Veilguard </em>that’s evocative of <em>Origins</em>’ persuasion checks. <em>The Veilguard </em>is full of memorable choices, quests, and characters, but in its dash to a more streamlined, <em>Mass Effect</em>-style RPG, it lacks the complex dialogue trees of the series’ roots. So when you get a conversation as impactful as the one with Mythal, it stays with you. </p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="09a4dcf26c04481f992bb57b55c251d9" data-recommend-id="image://09a4dcf26c04481f992bb57b55c251d9" data-format="jpg" data-width="1600" data-height="868" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Indiana Jones is shown holding a brush." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Indiana Jones is shown holding a brush." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Bethesda / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="09a4dcf26c04481f992bb57b55c251d9" data-recommend-id="image://09a4dcf26c04481f992bb57b55c251d9" data-format="jpg" data-width="1600" data-height="868" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Indiana Jones is shown holding a brush." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Hitting a Nazi in any context is a good moment worth spotlighting, but <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/indiana-jones-great-circle-review-is-it-good-pc-xbox-1851717174&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/indiana-jones-great-circle-review-is-it-good-pc-xbox-1851717174"><em>Indiana Jones and the Great Circle</em></a></span><em> </em>lets you do it multiple times with a <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://aftermath.site/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-melee-weapons-ranking&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://aftermath.site/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-melee-weapons-ranking" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">myriad of items at your disposal</a></span>.

A few dozen hours before you reach the end of the game, you learn that the protagonist you’ve been playing is essentially a character the prince envisioned and made corporeal. He is a projection of the hero the prince wants to see fight for a better world made real. Many hours later, you learn that More, the enigmatic guide who has helped you throughout your journey, is the physical manifestation of the king’s own hope, but turned to nihilism, escaping into a fictional paradise that sure does look like a modern-day Tokyo.</p><p><em>Metaphor: ReFantazio </em>gradually works its way to this moment. The game uses its fantasy world as a mirror to ours to illustrate that escaping into a fictional world where things are better is a defeatist mindset. People use escapism to survive, but it means they will leave the world outside their window behind. The Tokyo reveal is the end stage of escapism. Someone who once had the power to steer the world in the right direction decided to instead bury himself in a world where the work was already done and he never had to fight for anything. <em>Metaphor</em>’s story of collective action can’t end until our hero has stared into the fictional utopia he’s been aspiring to create and still decided to go back to reality and fight for a better future. It is a poignant, haunting moment masquerading as the sight of a mundane, modern-day metropolis. More’s imagined world is possible, but only if we make the effort to reach it. And defying his easy answer is when <em>Metaphor: ReFantazio </em>truly gets to the meat of what it’s trying to say.</p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="112a0c9d231e34ea4254e21280ba8891" data-recommend-id="image://112a0c9d231e34ea4254e21280ba8891" data-format="jpg" data-width="1284" data-height="717" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="A screenshot from Pokemon TCGP shows a Pikachu card, Wigglytuff card, and three Misty cards." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A screenshot from Pokemon TCGP shows a Pikachu card, Wigglytuff card, and three Misty cards." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->The Pokémon Company / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="112a0c9d231e34ea4254e21280ba8891" data-recommend-id="image://112a0c9d231e34ea4254e21280ba8891" data-format="jpg" data-width="1284" data-height="717" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="A screenshot from Pokemon TCGP shows a Pikachu card, Wigglytuff card, and three Misty cards." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p><em>Pokémon Trading Card Game Pocket</em> can be a deflating drag if you’re not paying money for it. Every day I was opening packs and usually feeling like I was getting junk pulls compared to the cards all my friends were scoring. Then, I got my first “God Pack.” These are booster packs that include nothing but rare cards. Admittedly, my first one was a bit disappointing because it had a threepeat of the same rare Misty card, but it also came with a full-art Pikachu card I had been looking for since launch. If I were weaker-willed this would have activated something in me and made me a sicko for cracking daily packs in hopes of finding another pack of this nature. But it had the opposite effect. It gave me the card I was looking for. So I comfortably closed the app and haven’t looked at it in weeks. </p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="117ae6ed7537678268240ff2980bf2c5" data-recommend-id="image://117ae6ed7537678268240ff2980bf2c5" data-format="jpg" data-width="1919" data-height="1079" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Curly is shown looking at the screen with an emergency warning in the background." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Curly is shown looking at the screen with an emergency warning in the background." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Wrong Organ</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="117ae6ed7537678268240ff2980bf2c5" data-recommend-id="image://117ae6ed7537678268240ff2980bf2c5" data-format="jpg" data-width="1919" data-height="1079" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Curly is shown looking at the screen with an emergency warning in the background." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>For a game that is light on the whole gameplay thing, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/mouthwashing-steam-pc-indie-psychological-horror-1851690195&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/mouthwashing-steam-pc-indie-psychological-horror-1851690195"><em>Mouthwashing</em></a></span> makes the most of its simplicity with some memorable moments. Giving painkillers to Curly, the captain of your crashed spaceship who was burnt beyond recognition when the freighter went down, is one such moment in Wrong Organ’s horror game. <em>Mouthwashing </em>has you painstakingly open his bandaged mouth as his one eye stares at you, then push the pills down his throat with all the awful sounds that come with it. The first time you do it, it’s incredibly unnerving, and with each subsequent time you do it, you start to become desensitized to it. It’s just a routine thing to do as you explore the ship and unwrap the mysteries of what happened here. But when those mysteries are exposed like the burns underneath Curly’s bandages, force-feeding him those pills takes on new meaning. There’s a lot of horrifying shit that happens in <em>Mouthwashing</em>, and the sounds Curly makes as you force him to swallow some pills aren’t even close to the worst of it, but they sure set the tone for how hard the rest of the game is to stomach.</p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="afpvuwnfoibrncd6upmy" data-recommend-id="image://afpvuwnfoibrncd6upmy" data-format="png" data-width="800" data-height="88" data-lightbox="false" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><span data-id="afpvuwnfoibrncd6upmy" data-recommend-id="image://afpvuwnfoibrncd6upmy" data-format="png" data-width="800" data-height="88" data-lightbox="false" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>When you first boot up <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/dragons-dogma-2-review-ps5-1851349573&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/dragons-dogma-2-review-ps5-1851349573"><em>Dragon’s Dogma II</em></a></span>, you might think you accidentally turned on the wrong game. The main menu screen simply says “<em>Dragon’s Dogma</em>” with the <em>II</em> conspicuously missing. But no, what appears to be an error or perhaps an attempt at branding the sequel as some kind of reboot of Capcom’s long-dormant RPG is actually an intentional tease of what’s to come.

As you reach the final chapters of Sunset Visitor’s adventure game, you’ve learned some harrowing truths about the science fiction world inhabited by clones, but those truths are weapons wielded by those in power. In most stories, if your player character were to die, presumably any truths they’d uncovered would die with them. But in <em>1000xRESIST</em>, memories and information are not tied to one person, as everyone can live through each other’s past via VR communions. <em>1000xRESIST</em> puts its protagonist, the Watcher, through hell as she fights to free her sisters from the forces that have kept them subservient for their entire lives. She gives her life to be a revolutionary spark of inspiration for someone else to follow. Sometimes that’s all any of us get to be. We’re a catalyst for someone else’s growth that pushes them to fight. Even if someone is gone, their impact and, in the case of <em>1000xRESIST</em>, their memories, persist, even as someone else takes the reins. “There is a you...That remains and remains.”</p></div><div><p>In the age of TikTok and Twitter, everyone is hoping to get a viral clip of them and their friends doing some wild shit. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/content-warning-impressions-1851407637&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/content-warning-impressions-1851407637"><em>Content Warning</em></a></span><em> </em>is that feeling turned into video game form.

What makes these bombs so memorable isn’t just the massive amount of hellfire they bring upon your enemies, but how much of a spectacle <em>Helldivers 2 </em>makes of setting one off. You have to enter a code to get the ball rolling, pressing your d-pad in a specific sequence you’d never pull off by accident. It’s a small detail that adds to the weight of what you’re doing as you set this bomb up to annihilate enemy forces. After you’ve punched in the code, you’ve gotta run out of the blast zone, and every second between activation and explosion feels like a full minute. Then, the bomb goes off and you level an entire area. You’ll reflect on the implications later, but at the moment, it feels pretty fucking cool.</p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="2f6c14b794d6edd2d4a5f862b2759806" data-recommend-id="image://2f6c14b794d6edd2d4a5f862b2759806" data-format="jpg" data-width="1600" data-height="900" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Rocket fires at a robot while on Groot's shoulder." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Rocket fires at a robot while on Groot's shoulder." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Marvel / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="2f6c14b794d6edd2d4a5f862b2759806" data-recommend-id="image://2f6c14b794d6edd2d4a5f862b2759806" data-format="jpg" data-width="1600" data-height="900" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Rocket fires at a robot while on Groot's shoulder." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p><em>Marvel Rivals</em>’ <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/marvel-rivals-hero-shooter-overwatch-team-attacks-how-1851718182&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/marvel-rivals-hero-shooter-overwatch-team-attacks-how-1851718182">Team-Up abilities</a></span> are one of the main factors differentiating it from <em>Overwatch</em>. These are character-specific perks that certain heroes get when specific other heroes are on their team. Some examples include  Namor getting an ice turret when Luna Snow fights alongside him, and Star-Lord being able to revive himself when Adam Warlock is on his team. But one of the best  is when the gun-toting raccoon Rocket and his sentient tree best friend Groot are on the same team. The dynamic duo team up with Rocket riding on Groot’s shoulder, which looks cool and nets them a passive damage reduction perk. Rocket can just pump Groot full of healing orbs and the tanky tree becomes a near-unstoppable force of damage and disruption.

Rocket and Groot’s team-up, however, feels like two players becoming a powerful unit, relying on each other to fulfill a new combat role.

As Cloud and company descend further into the Forgotten Capital, there’s a point at which each of them faces a trial drawing from a difficult moment in their past. They’re forced to re-experience the trauma that has pushed each of them to this point in their journey, including Aerith. The last of the Ancients is forced to relive the night she lost her mother. </p><p>The entire sequence is devastating on several fronts. Watching Aerith’s mother, clearly nearing the end of her life, trying to soothe her daughter’s anxiety by talking about them going on an adventure is gut-wrenching. You then play as a young Aerith pleading with uncaring adults in Midgar as she tries to find help, only to see her break down again as she realizes she’s powerless to change things. <em>Final Fantasy </em>grounds so much of its fantasy in raw human emotion, and <em>Rebirth</em> loses all sense of that in a convoluted multiverse play. But as you reach the end, it’s nice to look back at one of the most memorable scenes in the game and remember that when <em>Final Fantasy </em>stays grounded in those feelings, it fucking hits. </p></div><div><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/balatro-poker-roguelike-worth-it-is-it-good-review-pc-1851283124&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/balatro-poker-roguelike-worth-it-is-it-good-review-pc-1851283124"><em>Balatro</em></a></span>, the poker-based roguelike that took everybody by surprise in 2024, is known for being habit-forming, and there’s nothing that forms habits in video games quite like numbers going up.

This means walking back and forth through cold slush as you slowly lower a bucket down a well, dragging it to a barrel, and doing it all over again until it’s full.</p><p>Once you do that, another nun in the monastery just walks outside and dumps the barrel onto the ground. The entire process can take around 10 minutes, and all your hard work gets tossed aside in a matter of seconds. Plenty of games waste your time through poor design decisions or intentionally obtuse grinding, but <em>Indika</em> makes you do something incredibly monotonous, then spits in your face as a reminder of your place in its world.
