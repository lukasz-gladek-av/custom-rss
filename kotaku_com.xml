            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>New World was once the crown jewel in Amazon’s rising gaming ambitions. Developed in-house, the MMO initially exploded in popularity on Steam and seemed to have decent legs in notoriously competitive genre. Less than five years later it’s officially being killed. Servers will go offline in January 2027. The news has prompted a reaction from many who are tired of big games vanishing so quickly after launch, including an executive at Rust maker Facepunch Studios.</p> <p><span>“25m, final offer Amazon Games,” the London-based company’s COO, Alistair McFarlane, wrote in response to the news <a href="https://x.com/Alistair_McF/status/2011890710468071708">on X</a>. “Games should never die,” he added, before going on to juxtapose Amazon’s approach to online games with Facepunch’s. “As with everything we do at Facepunch, empower the community.” when someone asked what the<em> Rust</em> maker buying <em>New World</em> would look like. “Give them control, make servers publicly hostable. A game will live forever in the hands of a dedicated community.”</span></p>

 <p>The writing for New World has been on the wall since last fall. Despite recently releasing new updates and seasonal content changes appearing to come and go as planned, Amazon <a href="https://kotaku.com/new-world-amazon-mmo-shutting-down-servers-2026-layoffs-new-content-2000639761">announced in late October</a> that the game would be going on life support with no meaningful additions planned in the future. The servers would remain open and operating “through 2026” to allow the community “<span>time to continue their adventures in Aeternum.”</span></p>

 <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">Games should never die.</p> <p>— Alistair McFarlane (@Alistair_McF) <a href="https://twitter.com/Alistair_McF/status/2011894052128768316?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 15, 2026</a></p></blockquote>  <p>While Amazon is technically holding up that end of the bargain, remaining fans probably weren’t expecting the tech giant to kick the new year off with a full-blown death sentence. “We want to thank the players for your dedication and passion. We are grateful for the time spent crafting the world of Aeternum with you,” an <a href="https://www.newworld.com/en-us/news/articles/the-future-of-new-world-aeternum-what-to-expect">un-attributed blog post</a> that went up on the game’s website this week reads. “Together we built something special. While we are saddened to say goodbye, we’re honored that we were able to share so much with the community.”</p>

 <p><em>New World</em> is no longer for sale but anyone who already owns it can still re-download the game and play until January 31, 2026. Will there be any refunds? Of course not. Can you still buy premium in-game currency for real money? Strangely, yes. “Beginning July 20, 2026, players will no longer be able to purchase Marks of Fortune or anything else in game,” reads the new FAQ. Why not unlock everything and make all cash transactions in the game free? No idea.</p>

 <p>All of this stems from <a href="https://kotaku.com/amazon-layoffs-lord-rings-mmo-tomb-raider-2000639620">Amazon’s wider pivot</a> away from internal game development, with mass layoffs last fall that included the not only the end of New World but seeming cuts to other projects including a <em>Lord of the Rings</em> MMO. The company hasn’t confirmed if that project is dead or still being shopped around to other outside development partners. Amazon is also set to publish the upcoming Tomb Raiders games, including this year’s <em>Tomb Raider: Legacy of Atlantis</em>, a remake of the original game.</p>

              <p>Following on from 2024’s original Lego&nbsp;<em>Zelda</em> build, <a href="https://kotaku.com/nintendo-lego-legend-zelda-great-deku-tree-set-price-1851503670">the Great Deku Tree</a>, leaks have revealed the forthcoming follow-up, a set called The Final Battle: Ocarina of Time, due to release at the beginning of March.</p> <p>This repeats the pattern, given the original collab between Lego and Link leaked in 2023, and then was <a href="https://kotaku.com/lego-zelda-tears-of-the-kingdom-deku-youtube-copyright-1850136690">pretty much confirmed as real</a> by Nintendo rapidly firing off copyright taken notices. It’ll be interesting to see if the Japanese giant attempts the same pointless endeavor this time, or whether the fact that the new set is due in less than a couple of months means it’ll have to sense to consider this the beginning of its promotional campaign.</p> <p>Posted to Reddit’s dedicated forum for such matters, /Legoleak, user BrickTap shared two images to that my eye look like they’re from a fairly clumsily put-together internal slideshow. The images reveal the build number, title, release date and pricing.</p>

   <p>So for $129.99 (considerably less than the Great Deku, which was $300), the 1003-piece set features the climactic battle of&nbsp;<em>Ocarina of Time</em>, with Link, Zelda and Ganondorf minifigs, as well as a brick-built enormous Ganon, dual-wielding mighty swords. Also featuring are a Triforce, Megaton Hammer, and even some recovery hearts should Link’s fight meet complications.</p>

 <p>The second image reveals a hidden secret in the first, what looks like a ruined piece of castle opening up to reveal minifig Ganondorf’s throne.</p> <p>I do think it looks a little paltry. Less than half the brick count (hence less than half the price) of the previous&nbsp;<em>Zelda</em> build, this really does seem to be primarily about constructing a large Ganon, the rest of the scene really rather underwhelming. It’s primarily a flat base with a couple of bits of broken castle poking out, shown rather starkly with the second image’s removal of Ganon from the scene, and really seeming to lack in fun extra details or interesting terrain. I do like how Link is leaping, but the brown/gray dirge of the majority of the diorama seems a shame. Forgivable maybe at $60, but a hard sell at $130.</p> <p>If the details are correct, the set will go on sale March 1.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/roborocks-wet-dry-vac-is-40-off-now-selling-close-to-cost-as-it-launches-on-amazon-2000660299</link>
            <guid>1408126</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Tackling a true deep-cleaning day with just an upright vacuum is going into battle woefully outgunned. Even if it gets the surface stuff out of your carpets and most of the really big crumbs and dust bunnies off of your hard-surfaced floors, you’re probably left staring at stubborn dried food stains on the hardwood and enough pet hair still in the carpets to make a life-sized model of your pet.</p>
<p>Your first look at the Roborock F25 Ultra might have you thinking it’s just a somewhat-larger stick vacuum, and not much of an improvement over what you have now. Look again – the F25 Ultra is a wet-dry vacuum cleaner and high-temperature steam mop that is, quite plainly, one of the very best floor cleaning machines we’ve seen. It’s also carrying over its big sale price from the holidays – <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6761/">right now at Amazon the Roborock F25 Ultra is 38% off, dropping its price from $799 to $499</a>.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6761/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>No Mess Too Tough</h2>
<p>It’s hard to tell which is the biggest selling point for the F25 Ultra — its vacuuming performance with a mighty 22,000Pa of suction and 33 Newtons of downward pressure, its ability to deep-clean hard-surfaced floors with 187° Fahrenheit hot water and 356°F steam to destroy both stubborn stains and bacteria, its cutting-edge AI enhancements, or the fact that it cleans itself quickly and thoroughly without human intervention.</p>
<p>We’ll just call it a draw among all of them, and add in the fact that the F25 Ultra works its substantial cleaning magic in a single pass. You can work your standard vacuum and an old-school mop back and forth until you break a sweat and not come anywhere close to the cleaning result of one pass of the Roborock F25 Ultra. And the F25 Ultra doesn’t clean debris so much as it actively hunts it — rather than the standard headlight that most vacuums have, the F25 Ultra uses a powerful blue LED light to reveal even tiny particles in dark places that you would otherwise miss, and it can be folded down by a full 180 degrees to lie perfectly flat, and be driven by the Roborock app to run beneath furniture without causing you to get down on your hands and knees.</p>



<h2>Smart Automatic Adjustments</h2>
<p>Roborock’s DirTect technology enables the F25 Ultra to monitor the dirt levels it encounters and adjust accordingly, so the really stubborn stuff gets the full power of the machine, while lighter tasks get a lighter touch to help extend the already significant life of the rechargeable battery — up to 60 minutes of runtime with a full charge.</p>
<p>When it’s time for the Roborock F25 Ultra to go back to its charging station, it gives itself a very thorough cleaning. That same ultra-hot steam is used to clean the mop roller and destroy bacteria, along with 194°F hot water. A quick bath and recharge later, the F25 Ultra is ready for the next mess, no matter how big or gross.</p>
<p>Your deep-cleaning chore day becomes far easier and far more effective when you upgrade to the Roborock F25 Ultra and turn it loose on every flooring surface in your home. Amazon’s practically begging you to make the switch from your standard vacuum and mop to the F25 Ultra, with a $300 discount that’s still running right now.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><span>In the middle of 2025, I decided to take a step back from the grind of playing the latest releases and carve out time for something I’d wanted to get around to for years: </span><a href="https://intothespine.com/2025/12/31/stories-of-2025/"><i><span>Earthbound</span></i></a><span>. I had just gotten my </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/nintendo-switch-2-review-metroid-prime-4-pokemon-2000656188"><span>Switch 2</span></a><span> and<!--StartFragment --><span>—</span><!--EndFragment -->knowing I would enjoy a lengthy honeymoon phase in which my brand new console would be all I’d want to play<!--StartFragment --><span>—</span><!--EndFragment -->decided to boot up the legendary SNES role-playing game thanks to </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/tag/nintendo-switch-online"><span>Nintendo Switch Online</span></a><span>. And I’m so glad I did, because playing </span><i><span>Earthbound </span></i><span>for the first time was one of the most joyful experiences of 2025! There are likely dozens more surprises like it waiting for me in my constantly growing backlog.</span></p> <p><span>Unlike a lot of other folks, I’m really content with the restless state of my backlog. I relish the fact, for example, that I will never entirely conquer it. How, for every two games I triumphantly finish, three more will appear in the blink of an eye. Like a boss battle or random encounter that you’re meant to lose, I eventually gave up on the notion of quashing my backlog, and I think I’m much happier as a result.</span></p>

 <p><span>Games are wonderful things. Unlike many other mediums, they drop you into the world and perspective of their characters. They are these utterly dazzling and transportive experiences, and can range from space operas to </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/red-dead-redemption-2-the-kotaku-review-1829984369"><span>melancholic westerns</span></a><span> and everything in between. I can be a squid-kid and compete in the equivalent of professional paintballing or venture through the harrowing nightmares of a </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/bloodborne-fromsoftware-rpg-goty-ps5-the-doll-1849659930"><span>gothic town descended into madness</span></a><span>. And if all else fails, I can be some plumber who has somehow found the bandwidth to do it all and then some.</span></p>

 <p><span>I love how varied and surprising exploring these virtual worlds can be. I love booting a game up and disappearing into it. I love the way I get to embody a character in games, especially in the ones that let me sculpt my own. Why would I rush that? Why should any of us try to zoom to the end of these experiences? Shouldn’t we collectively stop and take in the vistas and skyboxes of these immaculately constructed fictions? Plumb every last cave and jump behind every proverbial (or literal) waterfall in search of treasure and adventure? I want to make the most of my time with video games, not min-max it.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <figure id="attachment_2000659915" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000659915"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000659915">©Nintendo</figcaption></figure> <p><span>My backlog is lined with games that hold these promises and so much more. I mentioned space operas because–and this always shocks folks–I’ve never played the entire </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/mass-effect-5-n7-day-bioware-blog-teaser-url-krogan-2000642122"><i><span>Mass Effect</span></i></a><span> trilogy. I missed the first game on account of its exclusivity back in the day, and only hopped onboard the bandwagon with the second entry. One day, I hope to experience the first title, and I’m sure that’ll send me down a path that’ll see me revisit the entirety of the trilogy. I cannot wait to embark on that tremendous adventure with fresh eyes and a new appreciation for the entirety of that cast’s arcs. I’m also in no rush to see that day.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><span>Likewise, I’ve yet to finish </span><i><span>Baldur’s Gate 3</span></i><span>, and I’m in no rush to see it to its end, either. I’ve never played </span><i><span>Demon’s Souls</span></i><span> or the latter two </span><i><span>Dark Souls</span></i><span> games to completion. Early </span><i><span>Final Fantasy</span></i><span> games and basically any RPG that launched before the year 1997 are a blind spot for me. Foundational titles of PC gaming, like the </span><i><span>Half-Life</span></i><span> series and </span><i><span>Myst</span></i><span>, still elude me, and I never really “got” </span><i><span>The Sims</span></i><span> despite all the hype around it.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><span>I hope to get around to these games and so many more. I’ve also got a lifetime to get to ’em. Why spoil the fun by imposing challenges on myself to see as much of them as quickly or efficiently as possible? Why spoil the magic rather than live comfortably alongside it for as long as I can? What is the actual material harm of letting a backlog grow? As far as I can tell, none. On the flip side though, voraciously consuming any and every game that has ever made some kind of impression on me just sounds miserable. It minimizes what can otherwise be life-affirming, or even life-changing, experiences with art. It also just spoils the potential fun of a lifetime of games.</span></p>

 <p><span>So take this as a PSA, if you must. Slow down. Savor your video game backlog. Preserve its magic for as long as you can. Oh, and play </span><i><span>Earthbound</span></i><span>, if you haven’t. You’ll thank me later.</span></p>

            <guid>1408105</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>I consider myself a pretty big <em>Avatar</em> sicko. I can name multiple characters from the franchise. I’ve read some of the comics and played the games. I enjoyed 2009’s <em>Avatar</em> when I saw it in a big theater all those years ago. I liked 2022’s <em>Way of Water</em> even more! And yet, I<a href="https://kotaku.com/avatar-3-fire-and-ash-reviews-rotten-tomatoes-score-spongebob-squarepants-2000654602"> walked out of <em>Avatar: Fire and Ash</em> in December 2025</a> supremely disappointed. So, in a desperate attempt to feel something good about <em>Avatar</em>, I booted up Ubisoft’s 2023 open-world <em>Avatar</em> game, <em>Frontiers of Pandora</em>, and gave it another shot, and you know what, it’s so much better than <em>Fire and Ash.&nbsp;</em></p> <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/avatar-frontiers-of-pandora-impressions-review-ubisoft-1851077773">I played <em>Frontiers of Pandora</em> back when it first launched on consoles and PC around a year after <em>Way of Water</em></a>. At the time, I found the game’s narrative to be threadbare and its gorgeous jungle landscape mostly devoid of stuff to do, so after I wrote about it for the site, I mostly set the game aside. Fast forward to a late night in December 2025, feeling down about how much I didn’t like <em>Fire and Ash</em>, and I decided to return to Pandora using Ubisoft’s game.</p>

 <p>Okay, the truth is that I didn’t just return in the hopes that the game would make me feel good about <em>Avatar</em> again. I was also curious to check out <a href="https://kotaku.com/avatar-frontiers-pandora-cheap-third-person-new-game-1851786644">the big free update for the game</a> that Ubisoft released last month that added a third-person mode, alongside a new paid expansion featuring a new area. I’ve yet to play the new expansion, which stars a character from the main game fighting back against the evil RDA and their Navi allies from the Ash clan. I’ve been too busy getting lost in the world of <em>Frontiers of Pandora.</em></p>

  <h2>Pushing through <em>Frontiers of Pandora</em>‘s bad opening section</h2> <p>The first 10 hours or so of <em>Frontiers of Pandora</em> are bad. You’re stuck in one location, the quests are forgettable, and for a good chunk of that time, you don’t even have access to your Ikran, a flying dragon-like mount. Bleh! Boo! Bad. But, after pushing through it over the last few weeks, I’ve discovered there’s so much to like about <em>Frontiers of Pandora</em> once you’re past that crappy start.</p>

 <p>The biggest discovery was that beyond the jungle biome found at the start, <em>Frontiers of Pandora</em>‘s other biomes are vast and varied. One of my biggest gripes with <a href="https://kotaku.com/avatar-3-fire-and-ash-trailer-fire-clan-james-cameron-1851787146"><em>Fire and Ash</em></a> was that it felt like <em>The </em><em>Way of Water Part 2</em> and didn’t offer many new places to gawk at. <em>FoP</em> doesn’t have that problem. The vast plains you enter later in the game are incredible. Super long draw distances and massive alien trees bent over by the unrelenting wind offer up totally different vibes compared to the jungle biome of the game’s earlier section.</p>

 <figure id="attachment_2000659865" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000659865"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000659865">©Ubisoft</figcaption></figure> <p>And then, hours later, and after some quests that actually address the complicated relationship between the Navi and their human allies that make up the resistance, I visited a new biome. It is covered in mist and feels like an alien version of the forests found in the Pacific Northwest. Even hunting in this biome feels different, with strange swarms of bugs ready to descend on every carcass if you let it sit around too long without harvesting. I also found a scared and withdrawn Navi clan of former healers that is the most interesting in the game.</p>

 <p>And unlike the Ash clan featured in the latest film, they aren’t just evil warmongers, but instead are complicated beings trying to remember their place in the world while afraid of what happens if they return.</p> <p>I’m reaching the end of <em>Frontiers of Pandora,</em> and I’m not sad at all. I’m actually excited as I have two past DLCs to dive into, each adding new regions, and then I have the recently released <em>From the Ashes</em> standalone expansion to play after all that. And if all of that content can be even half as cool as what I’ve discovered on my return to Pandora, I’ll be more than satisfied that I came back to this game that had remained buried on my backlog.</p>
