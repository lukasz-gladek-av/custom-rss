              <p>If you’re looking to expand your workstation with more devices, or just want to manage the gadgets you currently use, a docking station can help. Anker makes some of the top options around, and right now you can snap up its 8-in-1 option without paying the full price.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/7057/">Amazon just knocked the Anker 8-in-1 docking station by 26%, bringing its price down to $40, from $54</a>. There are no shipping charges to worry about, either, so $40 is all you’ve got to pay today. The only thing to keep in mind is that the offer – as you’d expect – is selling out fast. That means you don’t have a lot of time left to bag the savings. It’s best to grab it as soon as you can to avoid paying the full price later.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/7057/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Bigger, Productive Setup</h2>
<p>It’s a compact docking station that packs a mighty punch. It’s equipped with a USB-C PD-IN charging port, two USB-A data ports, two HDMI ports, an Ethernet port, and a microSD/SD card reader. That’s all you need to create a productive workstation for all your office and entertainment needs. The station is also compatible with USB-C Power Delivery to provide high-speed pass-through charging up to 85W, so you can juice your essentials up while catching up on work deadlines.</p>
<p>There’s support for a dual display setup via HDMI ports. You can stream or mirror content to a single device in sharp 4K at 60Hz, or connect to two external screens to both HDMI ports in 4K@30Hz. For instance, if you’re planning to game with friends, add a high-quality external monitor to enjoy breathtaking visuals and smooth performance. Working on an office project with colleagues? Having two external screens lets you take quick meetings on one, while viewing reference materials on the second and working on your primary screen. Note that Windows users can use each screen for different content, but macOS mirrors the same content across both external monitors.</p>



<p>As for compatibility, the docking station supports USB-C, USB4, and Thunderbolt connections. It plays nicely with a range of devices, including MacBook (macOS 12 and newer), Windows 10 and 11, ChromeOS, and laptops equipped with DP Alt Mode and Power Delivery. Included in the box are the 8-in-1 USB-C PD hub, a welcome guide, and an 18-month warranty for added peace of mind. A charging cable isn’t included, so you’d either have to buy one separately or use what’s already available.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/7057/">There’s a lot more to appreciate here, especially now that the hub is going for just $40 at Amazon.</a> Again, the deal is selling out fast, so it’s best to place your orders without wasting much time. That said, we’re spotting plenty of other discounts across the tech section at Amazon. Everything from smartphones to laptops, gaming monitors, and tech accessories is going for less. We’re covering the top deals, so be sure to check back to discover the latest drops worth your money.</p>

              <p>Astonishingly, we are already eight months into the life of Nintendo’s Switch 2 console. And three-quarters of a year in, it’s perhaps fair to say there’s not exactly been a rollercoaster of must-have games released. Given the disappointment of&nbsp;<em>Metroid Prime 4</em>, and the sheer paucity of other first-part originals, it’s becoming tricky not to think of it as a $400 <em>Donkey Kong Bananza</em> machine that has a side-hustle in ports. With a desperate need for the console to be given any sense of vitality in 2026, today’s <a href="https://kotaku.com/nintendo-direct-february-switch-2-oblivion-fallout-2000665999">Nintendo Direct Partner Showcase</a> not only did very little to take away from the impression of stagnation, but if anything seemed to go out of its way to endorse it.</p> <p>It was a very peculiarly put-together showcase. Any who try to fathom the decisions made by Nintendo are doomed to spiraling madness, but after the very pretty but previously announced <em>Orbitals</em>, we saw a visual novel sequel, a soccer anime oddity, and then what looked like a 2002 PC shovelware knock-off of a generic Capcom game, <em>Tokyo Scramble</em>. It was a deeply inauspicious start, suggesting that these desultory offerings were the games Nintendo thought we should be most excited about in 2026.</p>

 <p>This was then further cemented by longer looks at two years-old ports. First up was&nbsp;<em>Valheim</em>, the 2021 PC survival game, arriving on Switch 2 without a new addition or significant update, presented looking choppy and blocky (which I suppose are at least thematic) for the brand-new console. This five-year-old game still has a loyal following on Steam, with 30,000 people playing every day, so it’s not exactly forgotten, but it’s a weird pick to make such a fuss of. Then came the two-month-old news that the original 2017 <em>Hollow Knight</em> is receiving a free upgrade for the Switch 2. Very welcome, of course, and a great move by Team Cherry, but you know, <a href="https://kotaku.com/hollow-knight-silksong-dlc-sea-of-sorrows-switch-2-2000653816">something that was announced back in December of last year</a>.</p> <p>Somehow this was followed by&nbsp;<em>another</em> soccer game, a previously announced cross-platform Square RPG, another previously announced and previously released cross-platform Square RPG (OK, I’m being slightly facetious, people are excited to play <em>Final Fantasy VII Rebirth</em> on Switch 2), and then two more long-ago-revealed but still potentially interesting cross-platform titles, <em>Pragmata&nbsp;</em>and <em>Turok: Origins</em>. At this point the Direct seemed completely lost, just stringing together games we already knew were coming to Switch 2, but also coming to Xbox, PlayStation and PC, and all with little new information nor even release dates. The whole thing felt more and more like a proof-of-life for the console, rather than a showcase of reasons to be excited.</p>

 <figure id="attachment_2000666069" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000666069"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000666069">© Nintendo / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p>Perhaps you’re delighted by the reveal of a sequel to 2015’s PS Vita game&nbsp;<em>Tokyo Xanadu</em>, a long-awaited revival of Nihon Falcon’s classic ’80s/’90s <em>Xanadu </em>series, and all power to you if so, but this alongside <em>Digimon Story: Time Stranger</em> also felt like pretty weak offerings. But wait, hold on to your socks and hats, because up next was&nbsp;<em>Granblue Fantasy: Relink – Endless Ragnarok</em>! You know&nbsp;<em>Granblue Fantasy</em>, right? The 2014 mobile game? Or perhaps you’re more of a fan of the&nbsp;<em>Granblue Fantasy Versus</em> games that came to, er, PS4 and Xbox One? Even&nbsp;<em>Granblue Fantasy: Relink</em> didn’t come to Switch in 2024, instead arriving only on PlayStation and PC.</p>

 <p>Finally, way too late into the stream, some previously unreleased games with broader name recognition appeared. We got the already very well-known <em>Monster Hunter Stories 3</em> as well as <em>Resident Evil Requiem</em>, which would have been a massive deal if they hadn’t already been announced for the system last year, and in&nbsp;<em>Monster Hunter Stories</em>‘ case, via a previous Nintendo Direct. Between these, we also had the welcome news of a collection of literally 40-year-old classics, and a rapid-fire montage of yet more previously announced games. But why <em>Star Trek Voyager – Across the Unknown</em> and&nbsp;<em>Reanimal</em> were confined to this purgatory, and the rest of this dismal half hour was not, is anyone’s guess.</p> <p>And then the big finish! An 11-year-old, two-year-old, and 20-year-old game, each from Bethesda. <em>Fallout 4</em> and <em>Oblivion</em> are last year’s versions, but still games that have been re-released a comical number of times across the decades. And honestly, the fact that it felt borderline exciting that 2024’s <em>Indiana Jones and the Great Circle</em> was revealed as a Switch 2 game really underlined just what a dreadful Direct this had been. “Oh my goodness, a big-name game that was released in this decade!”</p>

 <figure id="attachment_2000666070" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000666070"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000666070">© Nintendo / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p>This was a Partner Showcase, which is to say a Direct which features no first-party Nintendo announcements at all. But given just how little of those first-party efforts we know about at this point, it needed to do some damned heavy lifting to offer hope to Switch 2 owners who might be wondering exactly why they upgraded over the holidays. Next week’s <em>Mario Tennis Fever</em> from Camelot will likely be a lovely 8/10 sports game, and there’s reason to hope that next month’s&nbsp;<em>Pokémon Pokopia&nbsp;</em>will offer us a fresh face for an&nbsp;<em>Animal Crossing</em>-like, but neither feels like a console-selling blockbuster. A repolished&nbsp;<em>Super Mario Bros. Wonder</em> at the end of March is…sure, great. Then we have&nbsp;<em>Yoshi and the Mysterious Book</em> set for spring, and that’s it for games with even that vague of a release date. At some point in 2026 we should get <em>Fire Emblem: Fortune’s Wave</em> and it’ll be gratefully received, but seriously, fucking hell, that’s it. Apparently there’s another&nbsp;<em>Splatoon</em> at some point in the distant future, too.</p> <p>It is surely impossible that Nintendo doesn’t have something up its sleeves for&nbsp;<em>Zelda</em>‘s 40th anniversary, right? But then it also feels impossible that Nintendo launched a brand new console without a 3D&nbsp;<em>Mario</em> title even announced, let alone released, and that’s somehow still true.</p> <p>Given all of this, today’s showcase needed to have some massive third-party announcement, some huge reveal that everyone would be buzzing about. And we didn’t even get close. It was abysmal.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Ring Floodlight Security Camera (Newest Model) Drops to Its Lowest Price of the Year, With Motion-Activated 1080p HD Video]]></title>
            <link>https://kotaku.com/ring-floodlight-security-camera-newest-model-drops-to-its-lowest-price-of-the-year-with-motion-activated-1080p-hd-video-2000665554</link>
            <guid>1427020</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>The Ring Floodlight Cam Wired Plus is a security camera and twin floodlight system designed to monitor your driveway, yard, or front entrance area from a single location. It is mounted using a single screw to an exterior electrical box, where it will receive continuous power, eliminating the need for battery replacements and the potential for dead batteries during the winter months. Motion detection triggers both recording and bright light when something moves within the camera’s field of view. The weather-resistant design and a wider angle of view than other cameras allow it to capture large areas of your home throughout the year.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5638/">You can purchase the Ring Floodlight Cam Wired Plus today on Amazon for $120, down from the normal retail price of $180</a>. This is a savings of $60 and 33% off.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5638/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>A simple way to secure your home while seeing all that goes on</h2>
<p>The Ring Floodlight Cam provides 1080p high-definition video, a live video feed, and color night vision, enabling you to identify people, cars, and packages in your yard at any time of day. Additionally, the camera has a 140-degree horizontal and 80-degree vertical field of view, enabling you to easily see driveways, patios, and side yards without leaving noticeable gaps in your coverage. Once motion is detected, you can open the application, view the event in real time, zoom in on any detail you wish, and use two-way audio with noise cancellation to engage in conversation with whoever is at your door.</p>
<p>The floodlights provide 2000 lumens from two integrated LED lamps, keeping the areas around your home lit and safe after sunset. The floodlights turn on and off automatically when motion is detected within the zones you set. You can also manually activate the lights remotely from your mobile device before you step outside, and deactivate them when your guest leaves.</p>



<p>Advanced detection determines whether motion is detected within the zones you selected. These zones can be customized so you receive alerts only when motion is detected in the specific areas of the image that are important to you. You can also ignore adjacent properties, busy streets, etc., that may generate numerous false alarms. You can also disable the camera or limit access to your recordings via the application. The Ring Floodlight Cam Wired Plus also includes a remote siren feature, which you can use to scare off unwanted visitors.</p>
<p>Installation requires a standard 4-inch-diameter round weatherproof electrical enclosure, with your current AC wiring used to ensure the camera remains continuously powered. Once installed, the camera connects to your 2.4 GHz WiFi network so that live video feed and motion alerts are sent directly to your mobile device. If you desire additional video storage and more sophisticated alert options, you can purchase a Ring Protect subscription separately. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5638/">The unit comes complete with the camera, mounting bracket, basic tool kit, and user manual, and can now be purchased on Amazon for $120, which is $60 less than the regular price of $180.</a></p>

            <title><![CDATA[Starfield‘s PS5 Release Date Might Have Just Leaked And It’s Not Far Away]]></title>
            <link>https://kotaku.com/starfield-2-0-update-ps5-release-date-expansion-switch-2-2000666046</link>
            <guid>1427017</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><span>A leaker by the name of Graczdari, who previously correctly leaked release date information about the PS5 port of </span><i><span>Microsoft Flight Simulator</span></i><span> and the physical release of </span><i><span>The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion Remastered</span></i><span>, has reportedly revealed the exact release date of the long-rumored PlayStation 5 port for </span><i><span>Starfield</span></i><span>: April 7, 2026.</span></p>

 <p><span>This information comes via a report from the Polish website </span><a href="https://www.ppe.pl/news/398522/potwierdzamy-starfield-na-ps5-premiera-za-rowne-dwa-miesiace.html"><i><span>PPE</span></i></a><span>, which also features an image from Graczdari that lists the alleged Product Numbers and European Article Numbers (EAN) for both the standard and Premium Edition PS5 ports of </span><i><span>Starfield</span></i><span>. Said information does vaguely line up with </span><i><span>Starfield</span></i><span>’s </span><span>upcoming Terran Armada DLC, which Bethesda has been teasing </span><a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/the-ps5-version-of-starfield-could-be-announced-soon-as-insider-shares-potential-release-date/"><span>since September 2025</span></a><span>.</span></p>

 <p><span>While the listed EAN for the PS5 Premium Edition of </span><i><span>Starfield </span></i><span>is exactly the same as the EAN for the Xbox Series Premium Edition for </span><i><span>Starfield</span></i><span>, the EAN Graczdari shared for the reported standard edition PS5 port does seem to be unique. That being said, every reputable EAN and GTIN lookup site I used to verify this information stated that no such product exists.</span></p> <p><span>However, GS1, the global authority on barcode identification and the largest supply chain identification organization, </span><a href="https://www.gs1.org/services/verified-by-gs1/results?gtin=196388613724"><span>has verified the EAN</span></a><span> in Graczdari’s leak. While they don’t hold any specific product information regarding the EAN, they do hold information about which company licensed it: Microsoft Corporation.</span></p>

 <h2><em>Starfield</em>‘s rumored 2.0 overhaul</h2> <p>Though it received a big expansion in 2024, no notable updates came to<em> Starfield</em> in 2025. That’s left some fans wondering about Bethesda’s ongoing plans for the sci-fi RPG and others buzzing about a <a href="https://kotaku.com/starfield-2-0-expansion-bethesda-ps5-2000654580">potential big 2.0 overhaul</a> coming to the game later this year. Several prominent YouTubers, including MrMattyPlays, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cXqlxb0a6xk&amp;t=8136s">said they were shown a 2.0 update</a> for <em>Starfield</em> behind closed doors, but weren’t actually allowed to mention what was in it and had no idea when it might actually be ready to ship.</p>

 <p><span>While that may add some legitimacy to the leak, it’s important to keep in mind that the EAN could be for any as-of-yet unpublished Microsoft product. Plus, while Graczdari’s previous leaks may have been correct, one of their recent viral claims, that the physical release of </span><i><span>Grand Theft Auto VI </span></i><span>would be launching later than its digital edition, </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/no-gta-6-isnt-skipping-physical-discs-at-launch-2000665471"><span>was debunked earlier this week</span></a><span> by Take-Two CEO Strauss Zelnick.</span></p> <p><span>Of course, rumors regarding a PS5 port of </span><i><span>Starfield </span></i><span>have been floating around since early 2024. Given Microsoft’s recent track record of porting all of its first-party titles to PlayStation, a port for Bethesda’s 2023 spacefaring RPG is now a matter of when more than if. We’ll see if that ends up being in the next few months. Rumors of a Switch 2 port of the game, on the other hand, are now <a href="https://www.resetera.com/threads/ppe-pl-starfield-is-coming-to-ps5-on-april-7th.1426351/#post-150924481">looking less likely</a>.&nbsp;</span></p>
