What followed is one of the most indelible sequences in the show’s short history: the normally stoic Milchick dancing under Technicolor lighting like he was transported back to the ‘70s with quaaludes steering his limbs. The unabashed joy and unhinged dancing were jarring in a place where handshakes only transpired after formal requests. It also shocked the people who made the show.</p><p>“We had a choreographer who came, but basically, Tramell just kind of went off and said, ‘I’ve got some ideas. I’ve got some thoughts.’ Then, they just showed me this dance he came up with,” Stiller jokingly says.</p><p>Lumon workspaces are typically monotonously mundane, barren of anything but four interconnected cubicles. Disrupting that with this foolishness seven episodes into the season added a somewhat terrifying levity that makes the bleakness of the characters’ everyday lives more apparent. That’s because every detail in the show seems meticulously arranged, down to the  lights used in the scene, which Stiller revealed he hoped “wouldn’t break the reality” of the show. </p><p>The surprise on the Innies’ faces when the lights started changing colors underscored the strangeness of scenario, and was pretty genuine. “We didn’t know the lights were going to change until we were shooting the scene,” Scott reveals. </p><p>There are only two more episodes left for the podcast to break down. They’ll also be sharing tidbits about the new season of <em>Severance</em> as each episode airs. Let’s hope, at some point, we’ll get some answers about those damn goats. </p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
