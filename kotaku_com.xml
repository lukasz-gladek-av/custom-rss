              <p>Handheld gaming consoles have come through in a big way this past decade. The Nintendo Switch paved the way for the other big players in the gaming space to rethink what it means to be able to game while on the go. We’ve since seen the advent of the Steam Deck—Valve’s PC gaming handheld—along with some other third parties throwing their hats in the race with the Asus ROG Ally and the Lenovo Legion Go. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6104/">PlayStation has its own take on the format with the PlayStation Portal Remote Player for PS5. Amazon happens to have it discounted for Black Friday and Cyber Monday.</a> The 11% savings equates to the handheld system dropping from $200 to just $179 for a limited time. You end up saving $21.</p>
<p>On the surface, the PlayStation Portal Remote Player looks like if you hacked up a PS5 DualSense controller and stuck the pieces to the side of your Nintendo Switch. That’s not a bad thing. The PS5 controller is comfortable to use, and having the handheld mimic it almost exactly allows for a more seamless experience when playing games between your PlayStation 5 console and your PlayStation Portal Remote Player. The handheld is capable of playing games at up to 60fps, displaying in a resolution of 1080p. Choose between either the white version or the midnight black model.</p>

<p>Where the PlayStation Portal Remote Player differs from the other gaming handhelds is its not a standalone unit. The Portal doe not let you play games directly on the unit itself. the games you play are either streamed from the cloud or streamed from your home PlayStation 5 console. So in that sense, it’s more akin to the Wii U gamepad as opposed to the Nintendo Switch.</p>
<p>Remote Play let’s you play compatible games you have installed on your PS5 console, be they PlayStation 5 games or PlayStation 4 games. This makes the PlayStation Portal Remote Player a great accessory for families who share the TV room. Are you a dad, trying to catch up on&nbsp;<em>The Last of Us: Part II: Remastered</em> before the new HBO season comes back? You can sit and enjoy the game on your PlayStation Portal Remote Player with some headphones while your kid enjoys Ms. Rachel on the TV.</p>



<h2>Better With PlayStation Plus</h2>
<p>With PlayStation Plus, you gain access to an expansive catalogue of digital games—a good chunk of which are Cloud Streaming compatible.</p>
<p>The Game Catalogue is filled with newly released titles that you will have access to play with a monthly subscription. It’s Netflix applied to video games. Dive into games like&nbsp;<em>Ghost of Tsushima</em> and&nbsp;<em>God of War: Ragnarök</em>. You also gain access to the Classics Catalogue where you can explore all the PlayStation games of yesteryear. You can play through the entire original God of War trilogy before stepping into the two latest games that came with 2016’s soft-reboot of the series.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Samsung 83″ OLED S85F 4K Smart TV (2025) at 42% Off, Time to Throw Out Your 65″ and Upgrade]]></title>
            <link>https://kotaku.com/samsung-83-oled-s85f-4k-smart-tv-2025-at-42-off-time-to-throw-out-your-65-and-upgrade-2000648809</link>
            <guid>1368379</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Samsung’s 83-inch S85F TV proves that OLED screens have finally gotten big enough to turn your living room into a real home theater. This 2025 model packs 20 neural networks that upscale everything to stunning 4K clarity and the OLED panel delivers deep blacks and vivid colors that LCD technology can’t match. The good news is that Amazon has <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6101/">just slashed the price to $2,497 for Cyber Monday weekend, down from the original $4,297 sticker</a>, which marks <strong>an all-time low for an 83-inch OLED with this level of AI processing power</strong>.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6101/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>AI Processing Works While You Watch</h2>
<p>The <strong>NQ4 AI Gen2 processor has 20 specialized neural networks</strong> that each work on a different part of image quality, such as sharpness, color accuracy, motion handling, and brightness optimization. These networks look at each frame in real time and find objects, faces, and scenes so they can make specific improvements instead of blanket processing that can make some content look too sharp or too bright.</p>
<p>When you stream a show that was made in 1080p or lower,<strong> the AI upscaling doesn’t just stretch the picture to fit the 4K panel</strong> but it also fills in missing details by guessing what should be there based on patterns it sees. This means that older movies and TV shows become clearer and more defined, so they can be watched on an 83-inch screen without looking pixelated or soft around the edges.</p>
<p>Samsung’s Vision AI goes even further by <strong>automatically changing settings based on the type of content you’re watching</strong>: Sports get better motion smoothing to keep fast camera pans clear, while movies get a different kind of treatment that keeps the cinematic feel with the right color grading and motion handling. You never have to go into settings menus or change picture modes by hand because the processor makes these changes automatically as scenes change in the same piece of content.</p>



<p>The<strong> OLED HDR feature makes contrast that LCD panels can’t match</strong> because each pixel makes its own light instead of using a backlight that bleeds into dark areas. When a scene goes from a bright outdoor shot to a dark interior shot, you can see true blacks in the shadows and highlights that stay bright without washing out the whole frame. This self-emissive technology lets you sit at wider angles without changing the color or lowering the contrast.</p>
<p>When you watch nature documentaries, cooking shows, or anything else where accurate color reproduction changes how you see the picture, Pantone validation makes sure that the colors match real-world references. Instead of looking too pink or orange like some TVs that value bright colors over accuracy, skin tones look natural in different lighting and ethnic groups. This validation process checks the display output against Pantone’s color standards.</p>



<p><em>Object Tracking Sound Lite</em> makes <strong>sounds that move across the screen to match where the action is happening</strong> in the frame: This makes the game feel more real, even if you’re using the built-in speakers instead of a surround sound system. The sound moves with the car as it drives from left to right instead of staying in the center channel and it helps your brain naturally connect visual and audio cues. <strong>Alexa integration lets you control the TV</strong>, look for content, and manage smart home devices without having to get up from your chair.</p>
<p>Right now, you can save $1,800 off the regular price of $2,497, and you get the <strong>newest model from 2025 with better AI processing</strong> that older models don’t have. This Cyber Monday deal is great for anyone who wants to improve their home theater and the huge screen, self-lit OLED pixels, and neural network upscaling work&nbsp; make streaming services, gaming, and regular TV watching feel like high-quality entertainment that is worth the money.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/galaxy-buds-3-pro-go-for-new-all-time-low-samsung-wants-to-sell-10x-more-than-airpods-this-cyber-monday-2000648805</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Samsung’s goal with their AI-powered earbuds was to make them understand how you listen instead of making you change how you listen – and they did this before Apple even announced that the AirPods Pro 3 would have similar features. The <strong>Galaxy Buds 3 Pro has adaptive intelligence</strong> that automatically changes based on your surroundings and makes them smarter than anything else you have in your ears right now.</p>
<p>The good news is that Amazon has <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4703/">lowered the price of these silver earbuds from $249 to just $159 for Cyber Monday weekend</a>. This is the lowest price ever for Samsung’s best wireless earbuds. Since Apple’s latest model doesn’t beat these on any important spec, this deal is even better for anyone who wants high-quality sound without the high price.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4703/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>AI That Hears What You Say</h2>
<p>Samsung made these earbuds with Galaxy AI technology which does the hard work for you so you don’t have to think about it. The adaptive active noise cancellation <strong>always keeps an eye on your surroundings and changes itself on the fly</strong>, so you don’t have to mess with settings when you go from a quiet office to a busy street. This means that when the earbuds sense that the environment is louder, they automatically turn up the noise cancellation. And when you need to hear conversations or announcements around you, they turn it down.</p>
<p>The adaptive equalizer goes even further by looking at how the buds fit in your ear and changing the sound profile to fit: Everyone’s ears are different, so the same earbuds can sound very different to different people.</p>



<p>The new fit fixes one of the biggest problems people had with older Galaxy Buds models: they were uncomfortable to wear for a long time. Samsung changed the design of these Buds 3 Pro to a canal style and the stems are shaped like blades which helps with <strong>stability and keeps the weight evenly distributed</strong>. When you use the stems, they light up with a soft glow. This looks cool and also makes them easier to find when you put them down in low light.</p>
<p>The Real-Time Interpreter feature turns these earbuds into a t<strong>ravel buddy that helps you talk to people in person</strong> who don’t speak the same language. When you turn on this feature, the person speaking Spanish hears their language through the phone speaker, and you hear the English translation directly in your ears. This makes the conversation flow smoothly without both people having to huddle around a screen.</p>



<p>The <strong>sound quality is good because there are two amplifiers and planar tweeters</strong> that handle high frequencies well and keep distortion low even when the volume is high. The dedicated high and low frequency channels keep bass and treble processing separate. This keeps tracks with a lot of instruments in different frequency ranges from getting muddy. You can hear this separation best in orchestral music or thick electronic music, where cheaper earbuds tend to make everything sound like a wall of sound.</p>
<p>At $159, you’re getting Samsung’s best earbuds for $90 less than their normal price: This puts them in the same price range as mid-range options that don’t have any AI features. The <strong>two-year Amazon-only warranty</strong> gives you twice the coverage you would normally get.</p>

              <p>Permanent outdoor lighting systems get rid of the yearly hassle of putting up and taking down disposable holiday lights every winter, then storing the tangled strands that always stop working the next year. Govee’s permanent outdoor lights “Pro” stay up all year on your roofline or eaves and you can change the color scheme for holidays, seasons, or everyday accent lighting with just a few taps in an app.</p>
<p>Installation is surprisingly easy because the clips have adhesive backs that attach each light in about eight seconds: This gets rid of the ladder gymnastics and frustration that make hanging lights the most hated chore. Normally, this <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4637/">200-foot kit with 120 RGBIC LED lights costs $759 but Amazon is currently offering it for just $459, which is the lowest price ever</a>. This deal started on Black Friday and will last through Cyber Monday weekend.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4637/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>RGBWWIC Technology Gives You Real Color Flexibility</h2>
<p>The RGBWWIC label means that <strong>each bulb has six separate LED chips: red, green, blue, warm white, cool white</strong>&nbsp;and an integrated circuit control that lets you control each light separately. This wider range of colors goes beyond basic RGB systems that have trouble getting whites right. It gives you bright, saturated colors for parties and holidays, as well as natural warm and cool whites that are good for everyday outdoor lighting.</p>
<p>The <strong>warm white mode at 2700K makes the room feel cozy</strong>, like old-fashioned Edison bulbs. The <strong>cool white mode at 6500K</strong>, on the other hand, gives off bright light that is great for security or task lighting around doorways and walkways.<strong> Each light can give off up to 50 lumens</strong>&nbsp;which is bright enough to light up the outside of your home instead of just adding decorative touches that get lost in street lighting.</p>
<p>The anti-glare lens design makes the light into a triangular beam pattern that cuts down on harsh glare while still letting people on the street and in nearby homes see it. This optical engineering stops the raw LED bulbs from blinding people when they look directly at them, making the display more pleasant for you and anyone who walks by your house. The<strong> 75 pre-programmed scene modes</strong> have animated effects like color waves, twinkling patterns, and gradient transitions that move across the whole 200-foot run.</p>



<p>The Govee Home app lets you control each LED individually so you can change the colors of different parts of your roofline to make patterns, text, or images on the outside of your home. You could show off the colors of your favorite sports team, write messages for special occasions, or make patterns of the American flag for patriotic holidays without having to buy different light strings.</p>
<p>The <strong>lights and power adapter both have an IP67 waterproof rating</strong>&nbsp;which means that they can be submerged in water up to 1 meter deep without being damaged. This makes them very safe from rain, snow, and sprinkler overspray. The <strong>IP65</strong> control box doesn’t protect as well but it can still handle heavy rain and dust without any problems. <strong>Govee says these lights will last for 50,000 hours</strong> which is more than 5 years of continuous use or decades of normal seasonal use.</p>



<p>To install, use the included VHB (Very High Bond) adhesive and clips to attach the lights 2 to 4 inches away from the wall or soffit. Each clip snaps onto the light housing and sticks to the outside of your house. This keeps the bulb at the right angle and distance for the best light distribution. The system comes in 16.4-foot sections that connect with waterproof joints. This lets you go around corners, over different rooflines, or skip parts where things like chimneys get in the way.</p>
<p>This Cyber Monday price of $459 instead of $759 makes permanent outdoor lighting cost less than many homeowners spend on disposable lights over just a few years, while delivering capabilities that temporary strands can’t approach.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/ps5-sold-out-after-black-friday-chaos-amazon-offers-ps5-pro-at-record-low-this-cyber-monday-2000648789</link>

              <p>The PS5 Slim, both the Digital and Standard editions, sold out completely during Black Friday sales. But the good news is that Amazon just cut the price of the PS5 Pro for Cyber Monday weekend and gives shoppers a rare chance to get Sony’s very best console at a record low price: <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6100/">This PlayStation 5 Pro usually costs $749, but the current deal brings the price down to $648</a>, a record low.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6100/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>True 4K Performance</h2>
<p>The <strong>GPU in the PS5 Pro has 67% more compute units and 28% faster memory than the base PS5</strong> and gives it the power to run demanding games at full 4K resolution without using upscaling tricks. You won’t have to choose between frame rate and resolution anymore when you play games that are optimized for the Pro because the Pro can handle both at the same time.</p>
<p>PS5 Pro enhancement patches for games like Spider-Man 2, Horizon Forbidden West, and Final Fantasy VII Rebirth <strong>unlock higher resolutions, better textures, and smoother performance that the base PS5 hardware</strong> can’t keep up with. You will immediately notice the difference in image clarity when there is a lot of movement or in detailed open-world environments where the standard PS5 drops resolution to keep performance up.</p>
<p>PlayStation <em>Spectral Super Resolution</em> is a custom <strong>AI-driven upscaling technology</strong> that looks at game images at the pixel level and reconstructs detail that is close to native 4K quality from lower resolution inputs. This machine learning method works differently from simple checkerboard rendering because it looks at how each pixel should look based on trained models instead of just filling in the gaps between existing pixels. <strong>PSSR lets games render at 1440p or 1800p internally and then upscale to 4K with very little loss of quality</strong>.</p>



<p>Dedicated hardware acceleration <strong>speeds up ray tracing calculations by up to three time</strong>s compared to the base console and makes ray tracing much better. Ray-traced reflections, shadows and global illumination effects that used to slow down frame rates on standard PS5 now run at playable speeds. This makes these visual improvements useful instead of just tech demos that you admire for a short time before turning them off.</p>
<p>The <strong>2TB internal SSD doubles the storage space of the first PS5 models</strong> which is good because modern games often take up more than 100GB with all their updates and DLC. With this extra storage, you can keep a dozen AAA games ready to play without having to delete and redownload them all the time based on what you want to play that night.</p>



<p>The <strong>console doesn’t come with a disc drive</strong> so you’ll have to buy games and movies digitally unless you spend $79 on Sony’s optional external drive. This choice keeps costs down, but it also means that there are no used game markets, no sharing games with friends, and no watching 4K Blu-rays without buying more.</p>
<p>The <strong>included DualSense controller has the same haptic feedback and adaptive triggers</strong> that made the PS5’s tactile experience stand out. These features set PlayStation apart from its competitors. The console has Wi-Fi 7, which makes downloads faster and streaming more stable. It also has USB-C ports on the front for easy charging of accessories.</p>
<p>The Pro costs only $150 more than the base PS5 Digital Edition when both are at full price, which is a very small premium for double the storage and much better performance. You’re getting hardware that will last for years and play the best settings on upcoming games, ray tracing features that make gameplay better instead of just screenshots, and instant upgrades to your current game library.</p>
