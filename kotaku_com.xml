              <p>Soon you’ll be able to walk into a <a href="https://kotaku.com/gamestop-staten-island-switch-2-stapler-auction-charity-1851785951">GameStop</a> to trade in, well, nearly anything. For one day only in December the company will accept almost any piece of junk you try to give it.</p> <p><b>Read More:</b> <a href="https://kotaku.com/gamestop-staten-island-switch-2-stapler-auction-charity-1851785951">GameStop Auctioning Off Infamous Staten Island Switch 2 Stapler For Charity</a></p> <p>This “<a href="https://www.gamestop.com/trade/">Trade Anything Day</a>” stunt will take place on December 6. Yes, there are certain exclusions on what you can walk in and plunk down on the counter in exchange for store credit. But the company claims it’s open to giving you store credit for some unexpected items.</p>

 <p>It’s a common-enough joke on the internet that GameStop’s trade-in values for even the latest games are pretty abysmal. But the advertisement for the “Trade Anything Day” features everything from a mug, to a taxidermied squirrel, to a lonely leather boot. “Bring Whatever, Get Store Credit” the ad reads, with “No Questions Asked” written at the bottom, modified to say “<i>Some</i> Questions Asked.*”</p>

 <blockquote><p>Hazardous waste or material, chemicals, liquids. Lithium ion batteries or items containing lithium ion batteries. Weapons and ammo. Dead or alive animals (Taxidermy items are valid for trade). Alcohol, Tobacco, drugs or pharmaceuticals (legal or not). Computers (such as desktops, laptops, notebooks, all-in-ones, minis, workstations, e-readers, tablets, thin clients, smart displays, virtual reality headsets with built-in processor, interactive flat panel displays with built-in processor) excluding certain MacBooks GameStop normally accepts in trade.&nbsp; Computer peripherals intended for use with a computer and weighing less than 100 pounds (monitors, keyboards/keypads, mice/pointing devices, external hard drives (excluding those normally accepted in trade), facsimile machines, document scanners, printers, 3D printers, label printers, digital picture frames. Small electronic equipment (portable digital music players, VCRs, DVD players, DVRs, digital converter boxes, cable or satellite receivers, projectors including those with DVD player capability). Small scale servers. Televisions. Gift cards and other currency (foreign or domestic). Jewelry. Sexual and explicit items. Items resembling body parts. Items MUST fit in our 20x20x20 measuring box. Terms and conditions of promotion are subject to change. GameStop employees have the discretion to reject any item.</p></blockquote> <p>Some of these exclusions make sense. You probably shouldn’t be bringing in expired prescription drugs. And while it might be understandable to&nbsp; not take VCRs and DVD players, not being able to trade electronic devices such as tablets, VR headsets with onboard processors (which would include the Oculus family of headsets) is a bit of a surprise.</p> <p><b>Read More:</b> <a href="https://kotaku.com/gamestop-bitcoin-half-a-billion-500-million-meme-stock-1851782733">GameStop Just Bought Half A Billion Dollars Worth Of Bitcoin</a></p> <p>I’ll have to see what weird things I have laying around to test out this policy to the fullest extent. Shame I don’t have all those wall-mounted deer heads anymore. I might have been able to put it toward $10 off <i>GTA VI</i>.</p>

              <p>We’re right in the thick of the holiday season. City streets are hanging up their festive, winter lights and folks have begun shopping for gifts for all their family, friends, and loved ones. Traditionally, Black Friday weekend and the following Cyber Monday tend to be a great time to save some cash on some new pieces of tech. However, Amazon has already pushed live a handful of Black Friday-level deals ahead of schedule so you don’t have to wait to save.<a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5342/"> Right now, you can grab the Bose QuietComfort Ultra Bluetooth headphones on sale for 31% off. They usually sell for $429, but the discount brings them down to as low as just $298</a>. You can end up saving $131 for a limited time.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5342/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Premium Listening Experience</h2>
<p>The Ultra version of the Bose QuietComfort headphones has a handful of advantages over the standard model. These utilize Bluetooth 5.3 as opposed to 5.1, granting a longer range, maintaining connection within up to 30 feet of your device. You can expect superior sound quality thanks to the Snapdragon processors. Bose calls out the regular QuietComfort headphones as having “durable, all-day comfort,” with the Ultra has “luxurious comfort,” which is an inherently silly distinction. This though is referring to the additional padding on the ear cups and across the headband.</p>
<p>The QuietComfort Ultra headphones also introduce Immersion Mode. This is Bose’s spatialized audio designed to make it feel like the audio is coming from outside of the headphones, leading to more lifelike sound.</p>
<p>This mode comes in addition to the Quiet Mode and Aware Mode.</p>



<p>Quiet Mode is Bose’s audio with active noise cancellation turned on. This does what it sounds like it does, cancelling out unwanted, distracting noises from your environment so you can focus on what you want to hear and nothing else. This is great for when on a plane with the turbine going crazy or when just in a busy, chatty office setting.</p>
<p>Aware Mode keeps you aware of the sounds from your surroundings, allowing those noises to filter through with your music, podcast, or audiobook. This is recommended for situations like when navigating the walkways of busy city streets where it’s good to hear oncoming traffic.</p>
<p>Both models are capable of up to 24 hours of listening time on a single charge. You get up to 18 hours when using Immersive Audio mode. They recharge pretty quickly. Only 15 minutes of being plugged in will bring you up to two and a half hours of listening time (two hours of Immersive Audio).</p>
