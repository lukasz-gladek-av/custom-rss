What isn’t awesome and is in fact shitty, dumb, and greedy is that Xbox is going to charge PS5 players $100 to play the game a few days early, despite <em>Horizon 5 </em>being a game that released back in 2021. </p><p>On February 27, Xbox announced that<em> Forza Horizon 5 </em>would launch on PS5 on April 29.<span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://store.playstation.com/en-us/concept/10010647&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://store.playstation.com/en-us/concept/10010647" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"> But if you spend $100</a></span> to buy the fanciest, expensive-st version— the Premium Edition—you can start playing the game on April 25. Xbox claims this is “early access,” but uh, I’ve been playing <em>Forza Horizon 5 </em>on my Xbox Series X for years now. </p><p>This is all really silly for a few reasons. First, it lays bare the fact that the early access scams publishers have embraced recently are completely arbitrary and nonsensical. A game that you can play right now on PC and Xbox is going to be released “early” for some players on PS5. Give me a break. Second, when Xbox launched <em>Forza Horizon 5</em> back in 2021 <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://support.forzamotorsport.net/hc/en-us/articles/4402249796243-Forza-Horizon-5-Announce-FAQ&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://support.forzamotorsport.net/hc/en-us/articles/4402249796243-Forza-Horizon-5-Announce-FAQ" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">it did charge $100 for early access</a></span>, which was still annoying but at least it wasn’t already out on multiple other platforms. Now, in 2025, it seems very strange to suggest that early access is just as valuable or useful. </p><p>Yes, I know that a lot of people who only own a PS5 might be really excited to play<em> Forza Horizon 5</em> and they might be willing to shell out extra money to get their hands on the game sooner. But you don’t even need an Xbox or PC to play <em>Forza Horizon 5.</em> <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.xbox.com/en-US/play/games/forza-horizon-5-standard-edition/9NKX70BBCDRN&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/play/games/forza-horizon-5-standard-edition/9NKX70BBCDRN" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">You can stream <em>Horizon 5</em> via Game Pass Ultimate on your phone or tablet instantly</a></span> and that will cost you a lot less than $100. </p><p>Ultimately, I’m probably wasting my time.<span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/paid-early-access-pre-order-starfield-diablo-iv-madden-1850831357?_gl=1*1i6zn7a*_ga*MTc0MjY2NTg1OS4xNzQwMzc1OTc4*_ga_V4QNJTT5L0*MTc0MDY4MTkwMy4xNi4xLjE3NDA2ODI4NjkuMjcuMC4w&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/paid-early-access-pre-order-starfield-diablo-iv-madden-1850831357?_gl=1*1i6zn7a*_ga*MTc0MjY2NTg1OS4xNzQwMzc1OTc4*_ga_V4QNJTT5L0*MTc0MDY4MTkwMy4xNi4xLjE3NDA2ODI4NjkuMjcuMC4w"> I’ve already written about how greedy and shitty early-access pre-order bonuses are </a></span>and how publishers are just delaying games for most people to squeeze out extra pennies from a few diehard fans who have no patience or self control. </p><p>And yet, despite me and many others pointing this out, a lot of people keep spending extra money to play games a few days early. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/paid-early-access-pre-order-madden-star-wars-outlaws-1851596675?_gl=1*1i6zn7a*_ga*MTc0MjY2NTg1OS4xNzQwMzc1OTc4*_ga_V4QNJTT5L0*MTc0MDY4MTkwMy4xNi4xLjE3NDA2ODI4NjkuMjcuMC4w&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/paid-early-access-pre-order-madden-star-wars-outlaws-1851596675?_gl=1*1i6zn7a*_ga*MTc0MjY2NTg1OS4xNzQwMzc1OTc4*_ga_V4QNJTT5L0*MTc0MDY4MTkwMy4xNi4xLjE3NDA2ODI4NjkuMjcuMC4w">As a result, publishers keep pushing their luck</a></span>—adding more days, charging more money, or even offering multiple release dates depending on how much extra you pay. Now, we’ve reached the next level of fuckery and Xbox is charging early access for a years-old port of a game that is currently playable on any phone via streaming. The future sucks.</p><p>  <strong><em>Correction: 2/27/2025, 4:05 p.m. ET</em></strong><em>: A prior version of this article incorrectly claimed Forza Horizon 5 didn’t offer an early access launch option on Xbox in 2021.</em></p><p> . <br></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

The Switch game seems like a significant departure from the untamed open zones of <em>Pokémon Legends: Arceus</em>, which is exciting because we don’t know what to expect. The stream gave us a trailer as well as a general breakdown, and we skimmed through both to see what details we could find. Here’s everything we noticed.</p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="36ee184a9960e112180eb234ced9b0c8" data-recommend-id="image://36ee184a9960e112180eb234ced9b0c8" data-format="png" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="A trainer aims at a Fletchling." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A trainer aims at a Fletchling." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->The Pokémon Company / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="36ee184a9960e112180eb234ced9b0c8" data-recommend-id="image://36ee184a9960e112180eb234ced9b0c8" data-format="png" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="A trainer aims at a Fletchling." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>One of the best innovations <em>Pokémon Legends: Arceus </em>implemented was real-time capture mechanics. This included over-the-shoulder aiming which let you toss a Poké Ball at a wild critter and capture them without entering a battle. <em>Scarlet </em>and <em>Violet </em>didn’t quite match this. You could throw a ball at a Pokémon as a way of initiating battles, but you would still have to fight the monster before you could capture them. In <em>Legends: Z-A</em>, it looks kind of like a mix of the two. You can still capture Pokémon without battling them, but it looks like it has a lock-on system similar to that in <em>Scarlet </em>and <em>Violet</em> rather than the option to freehand it. Kind of a bummer, but hopefully it feels better when you’re playing it.</p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="4fad372785fbf29c7c91ae0ccd716623" data-recommend-id="image://4fad372785fbf29c7c91ae0ccd716623" data-format="png" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="A trainer throws a Pokeball at a Flaaffy." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A trainer throws a Pokeball at a Flaaffy." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->The Pokémon Company / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="4fad372785fbf29c7c91ae0ccd716623" data-recommend-id="image://4fad372785fbf29c7c91ae0ccd716623" data-format="png" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="A trainer throws a Pokeball at a Flaaffy." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>One of the great challenges of a <em>Pokémon </em>game is trying to capture a new addition without knocking them out. This is why abilities like False Swipe exist, which will leave a Pokémon with 1 HP rather than knocking it out. In the first <em>Legends: Z-A </em>trailer, we see a Flaaffy seemingly beaten in battle, but the player still captures it in a Poké Ball. If this is the case, it takes some of the risk out of battles, but will make it a lot easier to capture a rare Shiny or Legendary Pokémon.</p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="cca0cf0789231f6e8c46ca43899dd76b" data-recommend-id="image://cca0cf0789231f6e8c46ca43899dd76b" data-format="png" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="A Chikorita attacks Flaaffy with Razor Leaf with Disarming Voice on its ability wheel." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A Chikorita attacks Flaaffy with Razor Leaf with Disarming Voice on its ability wheel." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->The Pokémon Company / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="cca0cf0789231f6e8c46ca43899dd76b" data-recommend-id="image://cca0cf0789231f6e8c46ca43899dd76b" data-format="png" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="A Chikorita attacks Flaaffy with Razor Leaf with Disarming Voice on its ability wheel." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Chikorita, Tepig, and Totodile are the starters in <em>Legends: Z-A</em>, which has fans convinced their final forms will each get Mega Evolutions. For Chikorita, its final stage is Meganium, and fans are theorizing its Mega Evolution might be a grass/fairy-type because of one small detail in the trailer. The Chikorita shown fighting the aforementioned Flaaffy knows the attack Disarming Voice, a fairy-type move Chikorita has historically never been able to learn. Could this be a hint that Chikorita’s move pool has been tweaked to prepare it for a fairy typing in the late game?</p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="7b0ffc8fc07d2713bc9ff2bcc0a21f09" data-recommend-id="image://7b0ffc8fc07d2713bc9ff2bcc0a21f09" data-format="png" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Totodile moves out of the way from a Rollout attack." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Totodile moves out of the way from a Rollout attack." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->The Pokémon Company / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="7b0ffc8fc07d2713bc9ff2bcc0a21f09" data-recommend-id="image://7b0ffc8fc07d2713bc9ff2bcc0a21f09" data-format="png" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Totodile moves out of the way from a Rollout attack." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p><em>Pokémon Legends: Arceus</em>’ battles were more cinematic than those in previous games, and part of what added to the chaotic nature of its fights were that you could move your character around as your Pokémon took part in the scrap. In <em>Legends: Z-A</em>, Game Freak is taking this a step further by integrating it into the battle mechanics. Positioning and timing are integrated into combat in ways they weren’t before, and as you run around your active Pokémon follows, setting up and avoiding attacks as they play out. So now you don’t just run around aimlessly during fights; you’re a more active participant in battles.</p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="3ec112048b7696a2133f05c74d47f911" data-recommend-id="image://3ec112048b7696a2133f05c74d47f911" data-format="png" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Chikorita's ability wheel shows Leafage recharging." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Chikorita's ability wheel shows Leafage recharging." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->The Pokémon Company / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="3ec112048b7696a2133f05c74d47f911" data-recommend-id="image://3ec112048b7696a2133f05c74d47f911" data-format="png" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Chikorita's ability wheel shows Leafage recharging." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Part of that new active system is that Pokémon attacks seem to have cooldowns. We can see when Chikorita is fighting Flaaffy that its moves have a timer before it can use them again. This makes sense given that timing seems to be a core part of battles this time around. Now you’ll have to make sure you’re well-positioned and can use the attack you need at the right time.</p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="1c470e8a9b7a842984062f71749d7f9c" data-recommend-id="image://1c470e8a9b7a842984062f71749d7f9c" data-format="png" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="A trainer floats off a rooftop using their Rotom phone." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A trainer floats off a rooftop using their Rotom phone." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->The Pokémon Company / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="1c470e8a9b7a842984062f71749d7f9c" data-recommend-id="image://1c470e8a9b7a842984062f71749d7f9c" data-format="png" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="A trainer floats off a rooftop using their Rotom phone." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Since <em>Legends: Z-A</em> takes place entirely in one city, it’s not too surprising that it’s doing away with some of the open-world traversal of <em>Scarlet </em>and <em>Violet</em> and <em>Legends: Arceus</em>. In those games, you would ride on Pokémon to get to high places, glide through the air, or swim across bodies of water. Based on what we can see in <em>Legends: Z-A</em>, the only Pokémon you’ll be using to traverse will be your Rotom—which is in your phone—to float between rooftops. That’s a little disappointing considering riding the Hisui Pokémon in <em>Legends: Arceus </em>was one of the best parts about it, but it makes sense given the environment you’ll be inhabiting in <em>Legends: Z-A</em>.</p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="98a3a7c17fbe8b5f0a10ee64d2aee145" data-recommend-id="image://98a3a7c17fbe8b5f0a10ee64d2aee145" data-format="png" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Urbain and Taunie in Legends: Z-A." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Urbain and Taunie in Legends: Z-A." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->The Pokémon Company / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="98a3a7c17fbe8b5f0a10ee64d2aee145" data-recommend-id="image://98a3a7c17fbe8b5f0a10ee64d2aee145" data-format="png" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Urbain and Taunie in Legends: Z-A." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>It’s become pretty common in <em>Pokémon </em>games to determine members of the supporting cast by which version of the protagonist you pick at the beginning of the game. In <em>Legends: Arceus</em>, if you pick the female character Akari, you’d meet the male protagonist Rei in the main story, and vice versa. In <em>Legends: Z-A</em>, it looks like you’ll meet one of two supporting characters called Urbain and Taunie depending on your character’s gender. We see what looks like a male protagonist meeting up with Taunie and Urbain chatting with a girl hero. The question is: will both characters essentially be model swaps of the same role, or will they have their own goals and quirks for us to learn?</p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="f7d6c3816848ba1d46959e431d5c4809" data-recommend-id="image://f7d6c3816848ba1d46959e431d5c4809" data-format="jpg" data-width="1362" data-height="766" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="AZ and Floette vibing in a hotel lobby." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="AZ and Floette vibing in a hotel lobby." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->The Pokémon Company</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="f7d6c3816848ba1d46959e431d5c4809" data-recommend-id="image://f7d6c3816848ba1d46959e431d5c4809" data-format="jpg" data-width="1362" data-height="766" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="AZ and Floette vibing in a hotel lobby." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>While this isn’t a hidden detail, it’s crazy to me that we’re just gonna gloss over AZ. The ancient giant is running a hotel in <em>Legends: Z-A</em>, but let’s not forget that this man is a reformed war criminal who created a weapon of mass destruction in <em>X </em>and <em>Y</em>. He is also an innocent babygirl who loves his Floette. We must protect him in the coming game, trainers.</p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="8ba7c86c2021a9a0e23c91f6a637a337" data-recommend-id="image://8ba7c86c2021a9a0e23c91f6a637a337" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Zygarde looks out on Lumiose City." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Zygarde looks out on Lumiose City." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->The Pokémon Company / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="8ba7c86c2021a9a0e23c91f6a637a337" data-recommend-id="image://8ba7c86c2021a9a0e23c91f6a637a337" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Zygarde looks out on Lumiose City." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>As the name suggests, Zygarde, the dragon/ground-type legendary who never got its own game as was tradition back in the day, will play a major role in <em>Legends: Z-A</em>. We see the Pokémon throughout the trailer in its dog-like form and there’s even a shot of one of its Zygarde Cells scooching throughout the city. But we don’t know what it’s actually doing as Lumiose City undergoes its renovations just yet.</p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="59674ea34052a3217096f06d8deca38f" data-recommend-id="image://59674ea34052a3217096f06d8deca38f" data-format="png" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="A Wild Zone gate has a &quot;1&quot; in the center as a trainer approaches." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A Wild Zone gate has a &quot;1&quot; in the center as a trainer approaches." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->The Pokémon Company / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="59674ea34052a3217096f06d8deca38f" data-recommend-id="image://59674ea34052a3217096f06d8deca38f" data-format="png" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="A Wild Zone gate has a &quot;1&quot; in the center as a trainer approaches." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Lumiose City is undergoing a major revitalization effort during <em>Legends: Z-A</em>, and it looks like some areas might not be accessible until you reach certain goals in the game. We can see some of the Wild Zones that Pokémon inhabit blocked off by numbered hologram gates. These might just be labels signifying where more powerful monsters roam, or they might require some kind of in-game signifier like a gym badge to let you through. Whatever the case, it looks like it won’t be easy to stumble into an area you can’t handle.</p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="f982341de8b04dfcec19f4dfe1c89313" data-recommend-id="image://f982341de8b04dfcec19f4dfe1c89313" data-format="png" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="A Rotom phone floats over someone." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A Rotom phone floats over someone." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->The Pokémon Company / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="f982341de8b04dfcec19f4dfe1c89313" data-recommend-id="image://f982341de8b04dfcec19f4dfe1c89313" data-format="png" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="A Rotom phone floats over someone." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>The final scene in the <em>Legends: Z-A </em>trailer shows a first-person view looking at a Rotom phone with a message that reads: “This is a promotion match announcement.” We only really know that <em>Legends: Z-A</em> will revolve around the Lumiose City renovations, but this implies that some kind of competitive tournament will take place during the course of the game. <em>Legends: Arceus </em>didn’t lean into the competitive sport that typically takes place in <em>Pokémon </em>games, but it was a historical game set before much of that was established in the universe. So it’s probable there will be more battles this time around, and perhaps a tournament in the midst of Lumiose City’s redevelopment.</p><p><br>We’ll learn all about that and more when <em>Pokémon Legends: Z-A </em>comes to the Switch in late 2025. </p></div></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
