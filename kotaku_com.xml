              <p>PlayStation in the UK has paired up with a company called Raylo to offer rental options for a huge range of its hardware. For a whacking £24.49 ($33) a month you can get a 1TB PS5 you don’t own, or make that £28.49 ($39) if you want a second controller with it.</p> <p>Called PlayStation Flex, it purports to lease out PS5s and accessories “starting at £9.95 per month,” deliberately aimed at customers who aren’t able or willing to pay the full price up front. But the reality is much more grim.</p>

 <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">Join your friends on PlayStation 5 with Flex. Lease a PS5 Digital Edition console starting at £9.95 per month, for a limited time only: <a href="https://t.co/7O84kquQ89">https://t.co/7O84kquQ89</a> <a href="https://t.co/RCeCNQfdZF">pic.twitter.com/RCeCNQfdZF</a></p> <p>— PlayStation UK (@PlayStationUK) <a href="https://twitter.com/PlayStationUK/status/2021926500245639184?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">February 12, 2026</a></p></blockquote>  <p>The “starting at £9.95 per month” claim in the promotional materials is extremely misleading. This is the price for the bizarre Europe-only <a href="https://playstation-flex.raylopay.com/products/new-sony-playstation-5-digital-edition-console-model-group-slim-white?term=12-months">825GB digital edition of the PS5</a>, roughly working out to $13.50 a month, but crucially only at that rate if you commit to a 36-month plan from which it is very difficult to opt out. In reality, to rent that lowest-tier console for a month without a contract would cost you £19.49 ($26.50), more than twice as much as the implied price.</p> <p>For clarity, let’s focus on the <a href="https://playstation-flex.raylopay.com/products/new-sony-playstation-5-disc-edition-console-model-group-slim-white?term=12-months">1TB standard PS5</a>, which purports on the front page of the store to be available for £11.59 a month ($16), but for a single month would actually cost you £24.49 ($33). The same console, to buy and own outright, costs £479.99 ($654, with tax included in that figure).</p>

 <p>If you signed up to that 36-month (three-year) commitment, which you cannot cancel, at the cheapest rate this would cost you a total of £417.24. So maybe a bargain, right? That’s £60 cheaper than buying it day one! Except, no, because at the end of those three years you’ve spent your £417 on owning <em>nothing</em>. You have to give the PS5 back. The person who bought it for a not dissimilar price three years ago gets—most importantly—to keep it, and also has the option of reselling it to make back a chunk of their cash.</p>

 <p>This situation obviously gets considerably worse if you rent the PS5 for a shorter period of time. If you were unable to commit beyond a monthly rate (which of course is the case for many with low incomes looking to find cheaper access to this tech, unable to commit to 12-month contracts, let alone three-year ones), for the equivalent three years you’d have paid out £882 ($1202) for a console you don’t even own.</p> <p>Oh, and let’s not forget, we did all this math for consoles that come with just one controller. Run that again with a couple of DualSense included and it’s £450 at the cheapest, £1,026 at the monthly rolling rate. That’s $1400 for a console you didn’t buy. (And just for fun, the PS5 Pro? $834 to $1840.)</p>

 <h2>If you cannot keep up payments…</h2> <p>This becomes more insidious when you note the ease with which these contracts can be entered into. <a href="https://playstation-flex.raylopay.com/#how-it-works">Sony’s store states</a> that applying for the deal takes “60 seconds,” and that “We only do a soft credit check and applying has no impact on your credit file.” Which is to say, it’ll allow you to sign up to a long-term contract costing hundreds of pounds without checking if you can afford it.</p> <p>There is nothing mentioned on the store pages for what happens if you’re unable to keep up your payments years after making the commitment, and the site’s AI assistant fought hard against telling me this, but eventually revealed that cancelling early requires having paid a minimum of 18 months of charges, plus that month’s and the next. So if you’ve signed up for two years but need to cancel after 12 months, you’ll need to pay another eight months’ worth of charges to get out of the contract. What happens if you can’t? It wouldn’t tell me. I’m waiting on a human response.</p> <p>Renting electronics was once a peculiarly popular phenomenon in the UK, with 1970s retailers like Radio Rentals and Granada renting out color TVs and washing machines to those who couldn’t afford to buy them outright. And of course those people would go on to spend far more in monthly payments than the item would have cost up front. There was another resurgence of this model, but <em>far</em> more predatory, in the 2010s with companies like BrightHouse working on a “rent-to-own” model, preying on those with the lowest income, designed <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-47452571">to trick customers into spending five times the real price</a>, although people did at least get to keep the product. (<a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-52090976">The company collapsed in 2020</a> under the weight of its own cruelty, after <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-41732865">it was found to have deliberately sold contracts to those who couldn’t afford them</a>.)</p>

 <p>Raylo pushes its rental scheme as a “circular economy,” claiming renting tech is in some way more sustainable and environmentally friendly, <a href="https://internetretailing.net/dyson-and-raylo-set-new-standard-for-circular-tech-as-eu-ramps-up-sustainability-push/">as was declared during its partnership with Dyson last year</a>. Meanwhile, the company has rather embraced its own model <a href="https://news.sky.com/story/tech-rental-subscription-service-raylo-clicks-on-30m-fundraising-13499275">by taking on board more than £180 million of debt and equity funding</a> in the last few years, all with a view to launching in the U.S. later this year.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[PlayStation Boss Joked To Horizon MMO Maker That It Felt Like Marrying Off His Daughter]]></title>
            <link>https://kotaku.com/horizon-steel-frontiers-mmo-beta-raids-ncsoft-2000668674</link>
            <guid>1435483</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Guild Wars publisher NCSoft revealed <a href="https://kotaku.com/horizon-steel-frontiers-mmo-ps5-trailer-2000643663"><em>Horizon Steel Frontiers</em></a> late last year as a new MMO spin-off that would see players group up together on PC and mobile to hunt the sci-fi franchise’s iconic prehistoric robots. Thanks to a new interview with one of the company’s executives, we now have some new details about the upcoming game and a funny anecdote about Guerrilla Games handing off control of <em>Horizon</em> to an outside developer.</p> <p>Speaking with the Korean <a href="https://www.inven.co.kr/webzine/news/?news=311254&amp;sw=%ED%98%B8%EB%9D%BC%EC%9D%B4%EC%A6%8C%20%EC%8A%A4%ED%8B%B8%20%ED%94%84%EB%A1%A0%ED%8B%B0%EC%96%B4&amp;site=webzine">publication <em>Inven</em></a>, chief business officer Lee Seong-gu shared more information about how the MMORPG will be structured, timing for its first beta test, and insight into NCSoft’s relationship with the PlayStation studio that originally created <em>Horizon</em>. He said Hermen Hulst, <a href="https://kotaku.com/the-magic-formula-behind-horizon-zero-dawns-success-1823647530">former Guerrilla Games studio head</a> and current CEO of the PlayStation studio business group, told him that there were two special requests for licensing the <em>Horizon</em> IP.</p>

 <p>“Hermen Hulst, head of SIE, joked that ‘Please do not kill [a] Tallneck (a giraffe-shaped machine),’ and insisted ‘Please take good care of Aloy. It feels like I am sending off my daughter at the aisle,'” Lee Seong-gu told <em>Inven</em>, based on a translation by<em> Kotaku</em>. Aloy seemingly won’t be playable in the game but it’s possible she could still appear in cutscenes.</p> <p>The executive explained that he made several trips to the studio’s Dutch officer to pitch <em>Horizon Steel Frontiers</em><em>&nbsp;</em>and had to prove he was a fan of the franchise. He also said that it was Sony’s idea to reveal the MMO at Gamescom 2025 but he convinced the company to let NCSoft reveal it to a Korean audience first at G-Star 2025 instead.</p>

 <h2>Big raids, no pay-to-win</h2> <p>Lee Seong-gu goes on to confirm that <em>Horizon</em>‘s body-part targeting and destruction will be a core part of the combat in <em>Horizon Steel Frontiers</em> and that players will be able to take part in boss raids with either 16 players or 32. Instead of fixed classes, players will be able to customize their own roles for combat, and there won’t be any auto attacks either. Fights will require manual inputs instead.</p>

 <p>The executive tried to assuage fears that the new game would just be a <em>Horizon</em>-style reskin of NCSoft’s existing MMO series <em>Lineage</em>, and said the monetization will focus on monthly subscriptions, battle passes, and cosmetics rather than pay-to-win mechanics or other gameplay-impacting microtransactions common to mobile games.</p> <p>As for when <em>Horizon Steel Frontiers</em><em>&nbsp;</em>will actually become playable, we still don’t have any firm release date. Lee Seong-gu said the current plan is to let players try it at a demo at Gamescom 2026 with the game’s first beta test following after that, potentially in the first half of 2027. It’s still pretty far off, in other words. Hopefully, Guerrilla’s own upcoming <em>Horizon</em> multiplayer game, <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=Horizon+Hunters+Gathering+kotaku&amp;rlz=1C1ONGR_enUS1089US1089&amp;oq=Horizon+Hunters+Gathering+kotaku&amp;gs_lcrp=EgZjaHJvbWUyBggAEEUYOTINCAEQABiDARixAxiABDIGCAIQLhgDMgYIAxAAGAMyBggEEAAYAzIGCAUQABgDMgYIBhBFGD0yBggHEEUYPNIBBzc3NWowajSoAgCwAgE&amp;sourceid=chrome&amp;ie=UTF-8"><em>Horizon Hunters Gathering</em></a>, launches sooner. As we reported last week, a new single-player open-world<em> Horizon</em> sequel <a href="https://kotaku.com/hzd3-horizon-sequel-guerrilla-ps6-hunters-gathering-2000666871">isn’t coming anytime soon</a>.</p>

              <p>The first two<a href="https://kotaku.com/capcom-survey-dino-crisis-sequel-remake-onimusha-okami-1851235768"><em> Dino Crisis</em></a> games, originally released on the PlayStation 1 over 25 years ago, have finally made their way over to Steam. That’s cool, but uh, wait a minute here, did Capcom include performance-killing DRM on these retro releases? Yes. Yes, it did.</p> <p>On February 12, Capcom announced a fun little surprise for <em><a href="https://kotaku.com/capcom-new-dino-crisis-merch-event-sequel-remake-horror-2000616659">Dino Crisis</a> f</em>ans. No, it wasn’t a new game or a remake or even a fancy remaster. Instead, Capcom revealed that 1999’s <em>Dino Crisis</em> and its 2000 sequel, <em>Dino Crisis 2,</em> were now available to buy on Valve’s large digital PC gaming store, Steam. As mentioned already, that’s cool. I mean, the games have been available on GOG for a bit and can be easily emulated on fairly weak PCs, but it’s always nice to see publishers bringing older games to more platforms and stores. Except, fans quickly spotted something silly:<em> Dino Crisis 1 </em>and <em>2</em> on Steam include Enigma Protector DRM.</p>

 <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">Playtime is officially over, kiddies!</p> <p>Dino Crisis and Dino Crisis 2 have finally stomped their way on to Steam.

Really? What’s wrong with these guys?” <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/app/4249130/discussions/0/796709978759016171/">asked one user.</a> Others pointed out that this is the same DRM that Capcom <a href="https://kotaku.com/resident-evil-4-remake-pc-drm-denuvo-steam-review-2000668182">recently added to its years-old <em>Resident Evil 4 </em>remake.</a> And that was a disaster, causing all sorts of performance problems for many users on PC.</p> <p>This is made all the more strange by the fact that these<a href="https://kotaku.com/dino-crisis-1-2-pc-gog-drm-freelancer-ff7-1851750391"><em> Dino Crisis</em> PC ports seem to be the same versions being sold currently on GOG</a> with zero DRM. For whatever reason, Capcom has decided that the same games available DRM-free on GOG should include crappy DRM that people hate if you buy them on Steam. As you can expect, a lot of people are opting to buy<em> Dino Crisis</em> on GOG until Capcom removes the DRM.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><i><span>Starsand Island</span></i><span>, a cozy farming sim from developer and publisher Seed Sparkle Lab, released in Early Access on February 11 and things are already off to a rough start. Kickstarter backers have reported not receiving their release codes, the Xbox Series version is reportedly a mess, its $20 cosmetic DLC ticked off its crowdfunding backers, and the “</span><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/starsand-island-devs-remove-unreasonable-clauses-from-the-games-eula-promise-more-features-and-fixes-in-coming-updates"><span>virtual goods</span></a><span>” clause in its EULA has raised some eyebrows.</span></p> <p><span>Those issues were quickly overshadowed by a wave of seemingly suspicious Steam reviews posted for </span><i><span>Starsand Island </span></i><span>at launch, many of which were reportedly from users with less than an hour of total playtime and zero other reviews listed on their profiles. I say “reportedly,” because while several threads </span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/CozyGamers/comments/1r2r2ou/the_emerging_starsand_island_controversy_what_is/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button"><span>on Reddit</span></a><span> and the Steam </span><a href="https://steamcommunity.com/app/2966320/discussions/0/756177397086247029/"><span>discussion board</span></a><span> have discussed said reviews, dozens of these suspicious reviews have since disappeared from </span><i><span>Starsand Island’s </span></i><span>Steam page.</span></p>

 <p><span>Unfortunately for the devs, the <em>Starsand Island</em> Steam review rapture ended up bringing even more attention to the game’s strange launch. Yesterday, Seed Spark Lab released a </span><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2966320/view/501724120277319772"><span>community update</span></a><span> post on the life sim RPG’s</span><i><span>&nbsp;</span></i><span>Steam page and its official Discord titled “Announcement Regarding Artificial Comments.” It takes aim at the “large number of overly positive ‘praise’ comments about </span><i><span>Starsand Island</span></i><span> appearing across various social platforms.”</span></p> <p><span>“Is this some kind of overpraise as an attack? We have no concrete evidence, but it does feel as though someone may be doing this intentionally,” posits Seed Spark Lab. “What makes it even more puzzling is that this approach is not cheap, since leaving a review requires purchasing the game. (We later discovered that some of these accounts refunded the game after posting their reviews.)”</span></p>

 <p><span>They also noted that they believe the majority of these overly positive reviews “appeared to be AI-generated,” and “kindly” requested that whoever is behind the reviews “to stop.” Naturally, regardless of whether Seed Spark Lab’s plea was made in earnest or not, the community post has drawn </span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/pcgaming/comments/1r2wn61/please_let_us_focus_on_making_our_game_in_peace/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button"><span>even more negative attention</span></a><span> to </span><i><span>Starsand Island</span></i><span>. There really is no way to prove who is behind the reviews, so there’s little point in pointing fingers, but I have to wonder how anyone would benefit from damaging </span><i><span>Starsand Island’s</span></i><span> reputation by trying to inflate its rating on Steam. Reverse review-bombing with AI bots? What will PC gamers think of next?</span></p>
