The program started just a few months ago and has apparently paid off. People normally rent CDs, DVDs, and Blu-rays from Geo’s 1,000 stores across the country, but the company decided to add PS5s to the menu as the price of the console jumped from 66,980 yen to 79,980 yen due to inflation and weak exchange rates. </p><p> “Rentals are originally meant to allow people to enjoy expensive items at a low price at home,” Geo product manager Yusuke Sakai told <em>IT Media</em>. “PS5 rentals are an extension of that philosophy.” The service sounds cheap indeed. Geo is charging 980 yen to rent a PS5 a week, or about a dollar a day. Plenty of time to beat <em>Astro Bot</em> or even <em>Elden Ring</em> if you’re off from work or school. </p><p>Some companies in the U.S. still provide console rentals as well, though it’s less clear how popular those are. Rent-A-Center will loan out a PS5 for $26 a week, much more than the Geo deal but still not terrible. But other recent trends in gaming have definitely made that proposition less attractive. Party games like <em>Guitar Hero </em>that might get you to rent a console for a weekend get-together or vacation are now nonexistent and many of the most popular releases can be played on a smartphone or older hardware. </p><p>A kid without a PS5 is way more likely to ask for <em>Fortnite </em>skins or<em> </em>Robux<em> </em>than a week-long glimpse of next-gen gaming. Of course, if we ever do get to that long-predicted console-less future, retro hardware rentals will hopefully make a comeback. </p><p>.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

That was just one example of the nightmares <em>Psychonauts—</em>Double Fine’s magnum opus—went through on its path to becoming one of the most beloved games of all time. It’s now 20 years since its official U.S. release, and that deserves celebration.</p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="195891" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="The Week In Games: What’s Coming Out Beyond Alan Wake 2" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="156" data-playlist="195891,196307,196470" data-current="195891"><div><p>The Week In Games: What’s Coming Out Beyond Alan Wake 2</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195891/195891_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195891/195891_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195891/195891_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195891/195891_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/21406.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>You can immediately see why <em>Psychonauts</em> might have struggled to convince a publisher. This was Double Fine, a company that was only famous for being the place where Tim Schafer—the guy who wrote the adventure game classics <em>Full Throttle</em> and <em>Grim Fandango—</em>worked after leaving LucasArts. Obviously everyone was expecting DF to be an adventure game studio, and somehow their first project was...a third-person platformer? But one where you had to solve puzzles, and it was story-led, and it was also a collectathon, but there were psychic abilities, and missions about dealing with complex trauma, and half the game wasn’t platforming but chatting with other characters...Microsoft, originally intended to be the publisher for an Xbox exclusive, never got it. </p><p>Microsoft’s feedback after focus group testing described the game’s storyline as “unoriginal, childish and overly complicated,” which are quite the most extraordinary descriptions of a game that was defiantly unique and surprisingly mature. The document went on to say, “Humor should be simplified and made immediately apparent.” And then it suggested the game set in a summer camp where hero Raz helps the staff and inhabitants of the summer camp, in a summer-camp-themed story, not be set in a summer camp.</p><p>Later entirely dropped by Microsoft, it was eventually picked up by publisher Majesco, with some stealth funding from <em>SimCity</em> legend Will Wright, and did manage to be completed. (It’s worth adding here that there’s a lot of romanticizing of this period and its triumphant tale of the plucky indie developer making good, but the reality is a swathe of people were fired, and <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.gamedeveloper.com/audio/classic-postmortem-double-fine-s-i-psychonauts-i-&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/audio/classic-postmortem-double-fine-s-i-psychonauts-i-" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">the remaining employees were crunched for months</a></span>.)</p><p>International publishing was another matter, and entirely lost in these various post-mortems is how THQ screwed things up even further. At the time in the UK, a full-blown advertising campaign was launched, review code sent out to magazines and websites, and then the game pulled at the eleventh hour. As I mentioned at the start, back in 2005 <em>PC Gamer</em> had run a large, very positive review, and had it not been the same issue that reviewed <em>GTA San Andreas</em>, it could have been on the cover. And then...it didn’t come out.</p><p>In fact, it wouldn’t come out for over half a year, then with no advertising or promotion at all, and stores I visited spoke of not being able to get stock. It just couldn’t catch a break. Majesco went on to take a loss in its year of release, and the game didn’t manage to sell 100,000 copies by the end of 2005. It was a flop.</p><figure id="" data-id="02c6ac35a5fb06f81b9763d825444483" data-recommend-id="image://02c6ac35a5fb06f81b9763d825444483" data-format="jpg" data-width="1274" data-height="717" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Raz on the game board in the Napoleon level." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Raz on the game board in the Napoleon level." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Double Fine / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="02c6ac35a5fb06f81b9763d825444483" data-recommend-id="image://02c6ac35a5fb06f81b9763d825444483" data-format="jpg" data-width="1274" data-height="717" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Raz on the game board in the Napoleon level." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Except, it wasn’t. Not after a bit. In 2015, Double Fine pulled out all the stops to celebrate the ten-year anniversary of <em>Psychonauts</em>, releasing yet another documentary, this time just about its development (you can see the first episode above), at which time Schafer revealed that the game had sold 1.7 million copies. More extraordinarily, 1.2 million of those copies were sold after Double Fine had managed to secure back the rights to the game in 2011. It was a game that would see a new burst of sales with each milestone in PC gaming, from the opening up of Steam to external publishers to the phenomenon of Humble Bundles.</p><p>And, importantly, it’s a game that absolutely merits all this attention and love. <em>Psychonauts</em> absolutely captured the wit and personality that had made LucasArts adventure games so great, and applied them to a very different setting. I stood by (and stand by) holding back from giving <em>Psychonauts</em> a 90+ percent score (even when the review was re-printed eight months later when it finally came out in the UK, by which time I received a lot of flak), because its platforming fell short of tipping over into that esteemed territory, but it’s a game that I wish everyone would play.</p><figure id="" data-id="739d28d153ae4d3b3247230151959e66" data-recommend-id="image://739d28d153ae4d3b3247230151959e66" data-format="jpg" data-width="1272" data-height="716" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Ford Cruller looks at Raz, his finger on his cheek." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Ford Cruller looks at Raz, his finger on his cheek." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Double Fine / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="739d28d153ae4d3b3247230151959e66" data-recommend-id="image://739d28d153ae4d3b3247230151959e66" data-format="jpg" data-width="1272" data-height="716" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Ford Cruller looks at Raz, his finger on his cheek." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Ask anyone who has, and they’ll immediately want to describe to you their favorite level (which is to say, their favorite brain into which they ventured). Many will say the Milkman Conspiracy level, which explored a character’s psychosis with the most incredible combination of wit and tenderness. Others will bring up the bull running sequence, with its amazing use of paintings and its equally amazing, unique art style. I will tell you it’s the guy with the Napoleon complex, because oh my goodness, there is so much that’s so smart in there.</p><p>But honestly, my favorite parts are between the levels, roaming the camp and talking to the other characters, finding the little secrets, or overhearing the gossip. So much of it is so loving, so respectful of its bonkers little people, and I managed to appreciate all this despite living in a country where summer camps aren’t a thing. Take <em>that</em>, 2003 Microsoft. (It’s certainly of some irony that Microsoft now entirely owns Double Fine.) It’s one of those games where you want to seek out every tiny detail so you can discover every single line written by Schafer and Erik Wolpaw.</p><figure id="" data-id="7faee3e3f47e5ed0654fdbaecfdf930b" data-recommend-id="image://7faee3e3f47e5ed0654fdbaecfdf930b" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="720" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="It's a little Napoleon, standing on a chair, holding a sword." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="It's a little Napoleon, standing on a chair, holding a sword." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Double Fine / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="7faee3e3f47e5ed0654fdbaecfdf930b" data-recommend-id="image://7faee3e3f47e5ed0654fdbaecfdf930b" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="720" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="It's a little Napoleon, standing on a chair, holding a sword." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>For the rest of this week, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://store.steampowered.com/app/3830/Psychonauts/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3830/Psychonauts/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">you can pick up a copy of <em>Psychonauts</em> on Steam for a wildly tiny 89c</a></span>, and if you never have, or haven’t since you played it on Xbox 20 years ago, I really recommend that you do.

But although the team has put out several games in just under a decade, none of them have quite felt like a collaborative effort bearing the distinct creative fingerprints of both creators, until now. <em>The Hundred Line: Last Defense Academy </em>may not be a death game like the duo’s previous work, but the tactical RPG is still overflowing with both Kodaka and Uchikoshi’s signature twists, turns, over-the-top characters, and bold design elements that have made each of their works memorable.</p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="196055" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="6 Things To Know Before Starting Persona 5 Tactica" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="227" data-playlist="196055,196572,196411" data-current="196055"><div><p>6 Things To Know Before Starting Persona 5 Tactica</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196055/196055_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196055/196055_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196055/196055_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196055/196055_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/21584.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>I’m about 30 hours into <em>The Hundred Line</em>, and for much of that time its premise is classic Kodaka, to the point where I was curious if it might turn out to be a secret <em>Danganronpa </em>game masquerading as something new. A group of teenagers living in a Tokyo complex are attacked by a strange alien invasion, and to help them face this threat, a weird little ghost-like mascot named Sirei gives each of them a blade that activates a mysterious power within them. Called hemoanima, these powers manifest as different weapon types that are an extension of each character’s personalities. The group is then trapped in the titular Last Defense Academy and told they must defend the school from the invading forces for 100 days. Only then will they be allowed to go home.</p><p>Everything about <em>Hundred Line </em>screams <em>Danganronpa </em>spin-off, even if officially it isn’t. The teenagers locked in a school by a devious mascot premise is one major similarity, but the game also features the same artist and composer as the murder mystery series. So despite its differences, it still has the same vibe. Initially I wasn’t sure what to make of this because Kodaka has made a career out of being self-referential. Each <em>Danganronpa </em>game paid homage to the previous one in ways that went beyond narrative throughlines. 2023’s <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/master-detective-archives-switch-review-danganronpa-1850592843&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/master-detective-archives-switch-review-danganronpa-1850592843"><em>Master Detective Archives: Rain Code</em></a></span> may have told a more noirish supernatural tale, but the underlying murder mystery structure was nearly a 1:1 recreation of <em>Danganronpa</em>, right down to the mechanics you used to solve its crimes. When nearly everything a game developer has done has been a callback to his defining work, you start to wonder if the guy only has, like, two ideas.</p><figure id="" data-id="476ba36a9e2e5701fa8f7363085fbb67" data-recommend-id="image://476ba36a9e2e5701fa8f7363085fbb67" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="720" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Sirei points at something with a cane and says &quot;During your time here, you few, you happy few, you band of brothers, will be molded into the perfect Special Defense Unit&quot;" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Sirei points at something with a cane and says &quot;During your time here, you few, you happy few, you band of brothers, will be molded into the perfect Special Defense Unit&quot;" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Too Kyo Games / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="476ba36a9e2e5701fa8f7363085fbb67" data-recommend-id="image://476ba36a9e2e5701fa8f7363085fbb67" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="720" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Sirei points at something with a cane and says &quot;During your time here, you few, you happy few, you band of brothers, will be molded into the perfect Special Defense Unit&quot;" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>While the derivative nature of <em>Hundred Line </em>was distracting at times, I can’t deny it scratched an itch. Kodaka’s brand of high-stakes drama juxtaposed with zany dark humor is still a winning formula, and although the sci-fi mystery it tells is maybe not as immediately compelling as his previous work, it goes in some wild directions that kept me guessing. However, with all the good comes some of Kodaka’s known quirks that you may or may not find grating if you’ve followed his work. While half the cast of trapped high schoolers meaningfully drive the plot forward, the other half serve mostly to derail serious conversations with obnoxious one-liners. For most of the game I wasn’t able to really get to know them because <em>Hundred Line</em>’s social elements are severely lacking compared to those in Kodaka’s previous work, but more in-depth conversations unlocked later which I’m still chipping away at. Even without those extra conversations, however, the cast is full of standouts like the brute with a heart of gold Takemaruand the unnerving assassin Yugamu. Even the characters who initially seemed like one-note tropes wormed their way into my heart eventually.</p><p>All of those different personalities manifest in different fighting styles for the game’s tactical combat. Invading forces will periodically attack the Last Defense Academy, and over the course of the game you’ll have to convince hesitant classmates to join the war effort. As your party grows, so do the challenges you’ll face. For the most part, <em>Hundred Line</em>’s big story battles are spaced out enough that each feels significant, and there are few enough of them that even the most challenging don’t overstay their welcome. If you’re the type of person who wants a Kodaka or Uchikoshi story but doesn’t consider yourself much of a tactical RPG connoisseur, fear not: <em>Hundred Line</em>’s battles feel more like puzzles than the more demanding combat in something like <em>XCOM </em>or <em>Baldur’s Gate 3</em>.</p><figure id="" data-id="fbe9cd5bf92251a73c1daab90f805dc5" data-recommend-id="image://fbe9cd5bf92251a73c1daab90f805dc5" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="720" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A battle in The Hundred Line." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A battle in The Hundred Line." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Too Kyo Games / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="fbe9cd5bf92251a73c1daab90f805dc5" data-recommend-id="image://fbe9cd5bf92251a73c1daab90f805dc5" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="720" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A battle in The Hundred Line." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>The crux of <em>Hundred Line</em>’s tactical battles is its AP system. These action points are what allow you to make someone on your team cast an ability, defend an objective, or even move across the battlefield. You’ll start out with only a few of these per turn, but defeating mid-level or higher-ranking enemies on the field will grant you more. As the battle progresses your team gets access to their ultimate abilities, which typically deal high damage to a large area on the field and can take out several enemies at once. These led to the most rewarding moments of <em>Hundred Line</em>’s battles for me, as I chained different party members’ ultimates together to give the rest of my team more chances to pull off a decisive attack.</p><p>One of my favorite fights came about midway through <em>Hundred Line </em>when the school was being attacked by a powerful Commander unit. They had nearly taken down my defenses and would have won the fight if I didn’t end the battle in one turn. Luckily, when a character reaches a certain low health threshold, they’re able to cast their ultimate as a final sacrifice, dealing devastating damage to the field but taking themselves out of the fight. By this point several of my characters were a light pat from death, but in my ranks I also had Kyoshika, the katana-using samurai with a passive ability that allowed her to do extra damage to enemies who were “alone” on the field and not surrounded by any of their teammates. At this point, I knew I had to take a scorched earth approach to the battle to emerge victorious. I sacrificed several of my teammates, using their self-destructive ultimates to take out several mid-level foes and give my team more AP. After I’d lost several of my crew, I had more than enough actions saved up for Kyoshika to whale on the lone Commander, with each strike more than doubled in power because of her passive ability. Doing this meant I was just barely able to win the fight, all because I was willing to sacrifice pawns and made do with what I had left. That kind of table-turning problem-solving feels great, and it was rewarding to see my understanding of one character’s strengths win me the fight. Those kinds of plays only became more common as the game went on and I unlocked new characters with their own specialties. Sure, it’s not as deep or daunting as some of the genre’s biggest names, but it’s got the juice.</p><figure id="" data-id="6ef1980c5bbf7483a2fa34a364a10a37" data-recommend-id="image://6ef1980c5bbf7483a2fa34a364a10a37" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="720" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Takumi holds his sword above his head." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Takumi holds his sword above his head." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Too Kyo Games / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="6ef1980c5bbf7483a2fa34a364a10a37" data-recommend-id="image://6ef1980c5bbf7483a2fa34a364a10a37" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="720" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Takumi holds his sword above his head." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>I’ve mentioned that <em>Hundred Line </em>feels like Kodaka’s greatest hits, for good and ill, but I haven’t touched on how <em>Zero Escape</em>’s DNA is clearly running through the game. That’s because the extent of Uchikoshi’s influence is pretty hidden for much of its run, and explaining it would rob you of some of the boldest swings the team takes. It’s why despite hitting the credits, I’m still not quite ready to dive into everything the game has to say and stamp “The <em>Kotaku </em>Review” on this write-up. I’ve been pulled away from <em>Hundred Line </em>by other obligations, but getting back to it is all I’ve been thinking about. If you’re a fan of <em>Danganronpa </em>or <em>Zero Escape</em>, know that even with the switch-up in genre, this is a true marriage of some of the best parts of both games.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
