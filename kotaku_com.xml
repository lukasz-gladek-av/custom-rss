When discussing a possible second season, Miller admits there are too many video games to choose from, before Wilson mentions arguably the most influential video game of all time. “The one I know I want to do is if we can figure out a way, the sort of granddaddy of all video games, I need to find a way to make a <em>Pong </em>episode.”</p><p>Before any of us could conjure up all of the possible twisted angles you can take with a 2D table tennis-themed game, Miller goes straight for blood, suggesting a <em>Pong </em>episode “could be equally disturbing as <em>Pac-Man</em>.” Just to refresh your memory, the <em>Pac-Man</em>-inspired episode from the first season involved a floating golden orb training a swordsman who emerged from a tank to escape a maze, before violently taking over his body for its own mysterious aim. Does that mean the <em>Pong</em> paddles will be controlled by humans ready to lob bombs instead of an innocuous white dot back-and-forth in a game of survival? Maybe not, but Pac-Man covered in blood after eating its way into someone’s body doesn’t make that suggestion an impossibility. </p><p>Miller also calls <em>Fortnite</em> the “Moby Dick of video games,” perhaps because the vast collection of IPs now present in it would make acquiring the rights a highly attractive but also very elusive and challenging prospect, or because, in his mind, the game’s popularity and cultural ubiquity make working with the property an obvious goal for anyone involved in telling stories rooted in games right now. Either way, a second season of <em>Secret Level</em> is not promised, especially given how the first has been <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/secret-level-review-amazon-playstation-pac-man-mega-man-1851716804?_gl=1*1q1pml9*_ga*MzQzNjkwNDM2LjE2NDY2NjQ1NzQ.*_ga_V4QNJTT5L0*MTczNDA2MzI1Ni4xMjMuMS4xNzM0MDYzNTg4LjYwLjAuMA..&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/secret-level-review-amazon-playstation-pac-man-mega-man-1851716804?_gl=1*1q1pml9*_ga*MzQzNjkwNDM2LjE2NDY2NjQ1NzQ.*_ga_V4QNJTT5L0*MTczNDA2MzI1Ni4xMjMuMS4xNzM0MDYzNTg4LjYwLjAuMA..">received by reviewers</a></span>.

Will he be a brief cameo, or actually be available to fight alongside Ciri in one or more quests as Vesemir, Geralt’s mentor, did in <em>The Witcher 3</em>?</p><p>Without giving anything away, CDPR’s developers point to the white wolf’s ongoing adventures in Andrzej Sapkowski’s books for clues. “Geralt will probably be around for a long time,”  lore designer Cian Maher told <em>IGN</em>. “In [prequel novel] <em>Season of Storms</em>, there is an epilogue. It takes place in Magpie Forest in 1373, 101 years after <em>The Witcher 3</em>. And in that epilogue there is a certain white-haired Witcher hunting a monster who remains unnamed, but who behaves in a certain way.”</p><p> He continued cryptically, “And obviously he has white hair. I think we can expect Geralt to be around for a long time. The capacity in which he does is…we’ll see. But I don’t think he’s going anywhere.”</p><p>The Witcher 4 probably still won’t be out for a while, but in the meantime fans can get more of Cockle’s Geralt in Netflix’s animated movie  <em>The Witcher: Sirens of the Deep</em> <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/witcher-sirens-deep-doug-cockle-netflix-witcher-4-1851651538&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/witcher-sirens-deep-doug-cockle-netflix-witcher-4-1851651538">that arrives in February 2025</a></span>.
