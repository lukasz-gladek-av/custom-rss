Bandai Namco’s monster tamer series hasn’t kept the vice grip on pop culture that Nintendo’s has, but <em>Digimon </em>has been respectably trucking along with all manner of games, anime and products for a dedicated audience. These days, <em>Digimon</em> is mostly doing its own thing. But, it’s about to release its own mobile card game app to compete with <em>Pokémon Trading Card Game Pocket</em>.</p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="196165" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="What’s Coming Out Beyond Pokémon: The Indigo Disk | The Week In Games" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="95" data-playlist="196165,195519,195905" data-current="196165"><div><p>What’s Coming Out Beyond Pokémon: The Indigo Disk | The Week In Games</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196165/196165_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196165/196165_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196165/196165_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196165/196165_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/21711.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>A teaser for the new game was posted on the official <em>Digimon Trading Card Game</em> social media channels, where the fox-like Digimon Renamon picks up a smartphone and is digitized and sucked into the device.

The teaser is vague, so we don’t know if this will be an official digital platform to play the modern card game, or if it will have gacha mechanics similar to <em>Pokémon TCG Pocket</em>.

Guerrilla owns Aloy as a character. So all that said, I feel worried, and not worried about Guerilla specifically, or <em>Horizon</em>, or my performance, or my career specifically even, I feel worried about this art form, game performance as an art form.”</p><p>Burch explained how SAG-AFTRA, of which she’s a member, has been on strike with many of the biggest video game companies—including Activision, Electronic Arts, and others—over AI protections, and pointed to the Aloy tech demo as a perfect example of what the group is fighting for. Burch noted that the performance rules the actors are asking companies to sign onto have already been agree to by others in various interim agreements. </p><p>“I just imagine a video like this coming out that does have someone’s performance attached to it, that does have someone’s face, or voice, or movement, and the possibility that if we lose this fight that person would have no recourse, they wouldn’t have any protections, and way to fight back, and that possibility makes me so sad, it breaks my heart, it scares me,” she said. </p><p> “We have proposed a deal that includes...industry-leading terms of use for AI digital replicas in-game and additional compensation for the use of an actor’s performance in other games,” a spokesperson Audrey Cooling of the game company bargaining group said in a statement last week. “We have made meaningful progress and are eager to return to the bargaining table to reach a deal.”</p><p>Burch suggested it’s not enough. “The technology isn’t the problem, game companies wanting to use the technology isn’t the problem,” she continued in her video. “We’re on strike and the bargaining group will not agree to give us common sense protections. I support the strike, I’ve always supported the strike, I believe fighting is what we have to do to protect the future and longevity of this career we all love so much.”</p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

This makes it the first fully animated film to be released in theaters in the franchise’s nearly 100-year history, but fans have reported nearly empty theater screenings.
