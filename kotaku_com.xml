In the time since, consoles and PCs alike have progressed even further, giving developers more power than ever to work with. As such, Sony has opted to revisit this hit game to bring its presentation more in line with its sequel, <em>Horizon Forbidden West</em>, with a killer remaster that packs in a whole lot of improvements. Here’s what you need to know about <em>Horizon Zero Dawn Remastered</em>.</p><h2 id="h112024"><a id=""></a><strong>What’s new in <em>Horizon Zero Dawn Remastered</em>?</strong></h2><p><em>Horizon Zero Dawn</em> was already a stunning game on PlayStation 4, and the 60fps update it received a while back for PlayStation 5 left a lot of folks questioning if it even needed a remaster. Well, however you felt about that, a quick glance at the many improvements makes it easy to appreciate this lovingly-crafted upgrade.</p><p>So what’s new? Here’s a breakdown of the most notable changes:</p><ul data-type="List" data-style="Bullet"><li>The overall visuals have been drastically improved, with better textures, increased foliage density, and reworked lighting</li><li>There are more than 10 hours of re-recorded dialogue and motion capture that make characters appear considerably less stiff in cutscenes, looking far more fluid like those in <em>Horizon Forbidden West</em></li><li>DualSense support is now available, offering haptic feedback and adaptive trigger functionality</li><li>You can now fully remap your controls</li><li>A wide variety of new accessibility features can be toggled on and off</li><li>Remixed audio that takes advantage of Dolby Atmos and PlayStation’s Tempest 3D AudioTech</li></ul></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="74ee52ccf17d7e60c590e2d2114a3986" data-recommend-id="image://74ee52ccf17d7e60c590e2d2114a3986" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Sony / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="74ee52ccf17d7e60c590e2d2114a3986" data-recommend-id="image://74ee52ccf17d7e60c590e2d2114a3986" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>Since <em>Horizon Zero Dawn Remastered</em> is the same game as the original, returning players should have a pretty good idea of its length and content. If you’re new to the game, though, you may be curious how long it’ll take to complete.</p><p>An average playthrough of <em>Horizon Zero Dawn Remastered</em> should take you around <strong>20 to 25 hours</strong>. This includes casually dabbling in a few side activities but mostly focusing on the main story. Of course, the remaster also includes the game’s only DLC, <em>The Frozen Wilds</em>, which can take another 10 to 15 hours to experience.</p><p>However, those seeking to see and do everything the main game and DLC has to offer can spend up to <strong>80 hours</strong> exploring its stunning landscapes, to clear all the bandit camps, climb all of the Longnecks, and finish a wide variety of other optional but rewarding tasks—doing that ultimately results in earning its coveted Platinum trophy.</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="02f730c620867dc161363d525ba744b7" data-recommend-id="image://02f730c620867dc161363d525ba744b7" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Sony / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="02f730c620867dc161363d525ba744b7" data-recommend-id="image://02f730c620867dc161363d525ba744b7" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p><em>Horizon Zero Dawn</em> was originally developed by Guerrilla Games, the same team that brought to life PlayStation’s long-running <em>Killzone</em> franchise. They have since focused on releasing more games in the series, including <em>Horizon Forbidden West</em>, <em>Horizon Call of the Mountain</em>, and the upcoming <em>Lego Horizon Adventures</em>.</p><p>However, <em>Horizon Zero Dawn Remastered</em> was remastered by Nixxes, who are best known for porting or remastering other popular PlayStation exclusives, like <em>Marvel’s Spider-Man</em>, <em>Ghost of Tsushima</em>, and <em>Ratchet and Clank: Rift Apart</em>. They’ve got a firm grip on this process, and it shows in this beautifully upgraded version of a game that was already gorgeous on PlayStation 4.</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="60d6a06738be1202229ca1234c113b05" data-recommend-id="image://60d6a06738be1202229ca1234c113b05" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1081" data-lightbox="false" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Sony / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="60d6a06738be1202229ca1234c113b05" data-recommend-id="image://60d6a06738be1202229ca1234c113b05" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1081" data-lightbox="false" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p><em>Horizon Zero Dawn</em> is available on PlayStation 5 and PC.</p><p>Since the game is published by Sony, it’s almost guaranteed that it’ll never release on Xbox or Nintendo consoles.

If you watch the story, if you pay attention to the story in <em>Gears 5,</em> you kind of come across that UIR rocket technology and that kind of stuff we were laying the seeds and the groundwork that by taking over this UIR territory, we’ve also kind of inherited their space program. So what I wanted to do with <em>Gears 6</em> was to get you off Sera to encounter what that could mean for the rest of the galaxy or at least the rest of the solar system.”</p><figure id="" data-id="d70a291d3a403db7acb752346bee2af9" data-recommend-id="image://d70a291d3a403db7acb752346bee2af9" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="720" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Gears 5 characters travel through a desert.

Presumably, travel would be slow, costly, and strategic. It no doubt would have introduced new alien enemy types as well, potentially introducing some interesting sci-fi mysteries about the origins of human and Locust life on Sera.</p><p>The industry veteran suggested those ideas, which didn’t sound like anything more than a pitch document at the time, were scrapped as The Coalition works instead on mining Gears’ past with a prequel centered around Emergence Day, the franchise’s version of the Invasion of Normandy when millions of Locust came out of holes in the ground to attack humanity, eventually leading to the use of weapons of mass destruction that ended up crippling Sera’s surface-dwelling nations.</p><p><em>Gears 5</em> also ended with a cliffhanger related to a choice about which main character to rescue, the consequences of which would seemingly get hashed out in<em> Gears 6</em>. It sounded like the plan was for the most popular choice among players to become the canonical one. Though, at the rate the franchise is going, it could be years before fans get to see that play out in a game. </p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

However, <em>Dragon Age</em> is fresh in everyone’s minds and I, too, had to laugh at how Roan’s outfit is evocative of Ghilan’nain, one of the elven gods the player faces in <em>The Veilguard</em>.</p><figure id="" data-id="b69755b1a636e143d8bcdc1bd6bd83af" data-recommend-id="image://b69755b1a636e143d8bcdc1bd6bd83af" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Ghilan’nain looks up at the sky with her arms outstretched." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Ghilan’nain looks up at the sky with her arms outstretched." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->BioWare / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="b69755b1a636e143d8bcdc1bd6bd83af" data-recommend-id="image://b69755b1a636e143d8bcdc1bd6bd83af" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Ghilan’nain looks up at the sky with her arms outstretched." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Ghilan’nain is a blighted elf, and without getting too into the weeds, that means her body has been twisted into a monstrous eldritch horror.
