Nintendo has put out a couple of big exclusives, sure, but by and large, the draw of the system largely lies in the ability to play games on the go that used to demand you be tethered to a TV. So if you’re thinking of buying the thing in these early post-launch months, you might be wondering what the must-have games it has to offer are. The pickings are slim, but we put together a list of the best games currently available on the Switch 2.</p></div><div><p>CD Projekt Red’s open-world RPG is one of the most impressive technical showcases for the Switch 2 thus far. <em>Cyberpunk 2077</em> once broke PlayStation 4s and Xbox Ones across the globe, but it runs well on Nintendo’s system. Driving around Night City is still a dream, and the Switch 2’s optional mouse controls are pretty intuitive in the game’s shooting segments. There are certainly better ways to play <em>Cyberpunk 2077</em>, but seeing it running on a Switch 2 is a reminder that while the system might seem like a pretty lowkey upgrade from the original, playing console-quality games on the go is still a novel experience eight years later. — Kenneth Shepard</p><p><strong>A good match for: </strong>Story-driven RPG fans<br><strong>Not a good match for: </strong>People with a weak stomach for some tough subject matter</p></div><div><p>A divine maiden must be escorted across a corrupted mountain so she can purge its towns, caves, and forests of gruesome demonic spirits. There are lots of ways a game could ask you to do this, but <em>Kunitsu-Gami: Path of the Goddess</em> settles on a unique hybrid of tower defense and excellent third-person arcade action. Japanese folklore permeates the meticulous, hand-crafted art direction, and Capcom’s in-house expertise when it comes to tight combat and beautiful animations is on full display. The Switch 2 version doesn’t look quite as polished and pristine as <em>Kunitsu-Gami</em> does on other platforms, but it’s still one of the most underrated real-time strategy adventures around, made better by the recent addition of new game plus and endless roguelike modes. —Ethan</p><p><strong>A good match for: </strong>People who love collecting orbs</p><p><strong>Not a good match for: </strong>Anyone afraid of big, long demon tongues </p></div><div><p><em>World of Assassination</em> is a treasure trove of stealth challenges, each one ending in a satisfying execution of a person you won’t feel too bad about removing from a shadowy world of conspiracy and dark secrets. With three full campaigns, side missions, countless arcade challenges, regular updates featuring celebrity targets such as the recently added Le Chiffre from <em>Casino Royale</em> (played by Mads Mikkelsen), and the endless roguelike Freelancer mode, <em>Hitman</em> <em>WoA</em> is a perfect forever game for those of us who like to sneak around places we’re not supposed to be. True, performance on the Switch 2 isn’t as great as it can be on more powerful hardware, and you do need to be online to access Freelancer mode and many other challenges. But <em>Hitman</em> presents such a rich buffet of unique and memorable stealth sequences, each full of opportunities to come up with an endless variety of clever solutions, that you could easily spend an entire console generation playing it before you feel like you’ve mastered everything the game can throw at you. — Claire Jackson</p><p><strong>A good match for: </strong>People who love sneaking around</p><p><strong>Not a good match for:</strong> People who <em>don’t</em></p></div><div><p>It’s no surprise that the two best games on the original Switch are vastly improved in their Switch 2 incarnations. <em>Breath of the Wild </em>and <em>Tears of the Kingdom </em>run at a smooth 60fps on the Switch 2, and if seeing these games running on a device that doesn’t feel like it’s struggling to keep them afloat isn’t enough, the Switch 2 editions come with new content thanks to the Zelda Notes app that adds new challenges and lore to two already dense games. If you played them before, they’re worth revisiting. If you never touched Link’s open-world adventures, they’re even more essential on the Switch 2. — Kenneth Shepard</p><p><strong>A good match for: </strong>People who want peak<br><strong>Not a good match for: </strong>People who get overwhelmed with dense systems</p></div><div><p>Nintendo’s biggest launch title for the Switch 2 is still arguably the best game the system has to offer. <em>Mario Kart World </em>is a sublime addition to the kart racer series’ long line of quality party game staples. Though it’s not without its frustrations, <em>World </em>is the chaotic, rollicking fun of throwing a blue shell down a track or barreling through your enemies as a Bullet Bill at its best. The open world is kind of empty, but it’s a fun playground to practice all the cool stunts you can do now, like riding on the wall and grinding on rails. <em>Mario Kart World </em>is all about giving you the freedom to race how you want, and that means giving you more tools, more players on the track at once, and more bothersome items to chuck at your foes. This is only the beginning, and Nintendo will likely be updating the game for years to come. <em>Mario Kart World </em>will undoubtedly be a staple of the Switch 2’s lifetime. — Kenneth Shepard</p><p><strong>A good match for: </strong>Everyone, really<br><strong>Not a good match for: </strong>Anyone looking for something chill</p></div><div><p>Y’all, it’s a damn galaxy in your pocket. Do I even need to say anything else? Over the years, <em>No Man’s Sky</em> has continued to improve, expanding the potential of what you can do in its virtually endless playground of procedurally generated planets and ecosystems. Being able to jump into your ship and fly directly to a planet you can see off in the distance hasn’t gotten old since 2016. Though there are many quests and neat challenges you can take on, you don’t have to; <em>NMS</em> is the game you want to make out of it. Want a hardcore survival experience across the vastness of a simulated galaxy? It’s here. Want to set up an oxygen farm on a remote moon somewhere? Time to get digging. Want to catalog all of the lifeforms on a planet that’ll take you hours upon hours to walk across? Lace up your boots. Hello Games’ massive space sim works really well in portable format, whether you’re playing online or off. Dogfights in space. Finding planets no one’s seen before. Seeing a gorgeous vista where you can seamlessly travel to virtually anything you can see. When you’ve an appetite for galactic expeditions, <em>No Man’s Sky</em> is here to deliver multiple courses. — Claire Jackson</p><p><strong>A good match for:</strong> Digital space explorers who aren’t afraid to find their own fun</p><p><strong>Not a good match for: </strong>Folks who find survival mechanics overbearing or want a more traditional, guided gaming experience</p></div><div><p>Hazelight’s co-op platformer <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/split-fiction-review-hazelight-coop-game-it-takes-two-1851767470&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/split-fiction-review-hazelight-coop-game-it-takes-two-1851767470"><em>Split Fiction</em></a></span> doesn’t feel built for the Switch 2. Its split-screen format makes it a pain to play in tabletop mode, so it’s really best played on a TV like you would on your PS5 or Xbox. But once you’ve got it running on a big screen, the game is still a hoot. Though its cheesy writing leaves much to be desired, as a cooperative platformer with a ton of mechanical and environmental variety, it’s easily the best in Hazelight’s long history of co-op games. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/split-fiction-final-level-mio-zoe-rader-ending-1851768868&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/split-fiction-final-level-mio-zoe-rader-ending-1851768868">That final level still whips ass, too</a></span>. — Kenneth Shepard</p><p><strong>A good match for: </strong>Someone with a friend to play with<br><strong>Not a good match for: </strong>Someone who doesn’t have a friend to play with</p></div><div><p>Fighting games were always going to be one of the biggest tests of the Switch 2's technical capabilities, and Capcom thankfully managed to bring one of the best genre entries in recent years to the system without much compromise in <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/street-fighter-6-review-world-tour-story-mode-roster-1850481281&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/street-fighter-6-review-world-tour-story-mode-roster-1850481281"><em>Street Fighter 6</em></a></span>. Some of its Switch 2 features, like amiibo support and motion controls with the Joy-Cons, feel like cute nods to the system’s original features rather than something that fundamentally changes the game, so you’ll most likely go right back to standard play before long. Once you do, though, you’ll find a really great version of an already stellar game running at a smooth 60fps. Sure, it’s probably not going to be the version people are playing at EVO, but it’s more than good enough to break out at the function and play with friends. — Kenneth Shepard</p><p><strong>A good match for: </strong>The fighting game sickos<br><strong>Not a good match for: </strong>People who don’t like to memorize combos</p></div><div><p>Donkey Kong and Pauline’s latest adventure is one of the Switch 2’s most impressive technical achievements.

Is it the <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/switch-2-launch-lineup-single-player-mario-3d-mkw-1851784352&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/switch-2-launch-lineup-single-player-mario-3d-mkw-1851784352">cultural moment the system needs to bring people in out of the gate</a></span>? Maybe not. But it’s still an absolute delight worth booting up if you’ve got the system in its first few months. — Kenneth Shepard</p><p><strong>A good match for: </strong>People who wanted <em>King Kong </em>to have a happier ending<br><strong>Not a good match for: </strong>People who can’t move on without finding every collectable in a level</p></div><div><p>Shin’en Multimedia is back, filling another <em>F-Zero</em>-sized hole in another Nintendo console launch. <em>Fast Fusion </em>is a simple but slick racer in which you zip through crisp, hyper-realistic sci-fi courses snagging speed boosts and avoiding crashes. There’s a jump button because it’s fun to jump when it feels like you’re about to break the sound barrier, and a new mechanic that lets you combine two vehicles together to take advantage of their combined stats. It’s better than it has any right to be and a fun, flashy exclusive to show off Nintendo’s new console. — Ethan</p><p><strong>A good match for:</strong> Unreal Engine sickos who love <em>WipeOut</em></p><p><strong>Not a good match for: </strong>Those who get easily carsick</p></div><div><p>The life sim RPGs that helped define the modern Nintendo handheld landscape are alive and well on Switch 2, and <em>Fantasy Life i: The Girl Who Steals Time</em> is the best of them when it comes to rewarding grinding loops that give you a fair bit of freedom. It’s a city builder, survival crafting sim, and simple action-RPG all rolled up into one, with a pleasant art style and music by longtime<em> Final Fantasy </em>composer Nobuo Uematsu. There are so, so many parts, and the sum of each of them offers a progression loop that’s rewarding and compelling enough to make up for its flaws. —Ethan</p><p><strong>A good match for: </strong>Those who wish <em>Final Fantasy V</em> was more like<em> Animal Crossing</em></p><p><strong>Not a good match for:</strong> People who hate experiencing life through menus </p></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://kotaku.com/nintendo-switch-2-best-games-mario-kart-donkey-kong-1851786840]]></content:encoded>

At the time it was all very coy about how it would look, and there was no mention of a price. Well, now we have both, and...it’s all incredibly good news! And it’s out October 1.</p><p>The new Lego build looks incredible. It’s a “near 1:1” model, and Lego appears to have conceded to multiple bespoke new blocks to achieve a perfect look. The A and B buttons have what look like unique fuchsia caps, along with a vented curved piece to recreate the bottom right corner of the incredibly familiar handheld. That’s then contrasted by the unabashedly Lego cross-shaped d-pad, to ensure it still has a bricky style. Then there are what appear to be printed pieces depicting the all-important “DOT MATRIX WITH STEREO SOUND” across the top, headphones label down the bottom, and of course the words “Nintendo GAME BOY tm” across the middle. Printed, and not fiddly stickers.</p><figure id="" data-id="6f51fcde1b8cdd32b30bdb4dcc7ec1d4" data-recommend-id="image://6f51fcde1b8cdd32b30bdb4dcc7ec1d4" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="720" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A human is putting the Lego Game Boy onto its stand." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A human is putting the Lego Game Boy onto its stand." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Photo<!-- -->: <!-- -->Lego / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="6f51fcde1b8cdd32b30bdb4dcc7ec1d4" data-recommend-id="image://6f51fcde1b8cdd32b30bdb4dcc7ec1d4" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="720" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A human is putting the Lego Game Boy onto its stand." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Perfectly finishing it off is the screen, behind which you can place lenticular lenses that mean the image changes as you move the block around. It doesn’t actually play games, what with being made of molded plastic bricks, but comes with pretend paks for <em>Zelda</em> and <em>Super Mario Land</em> that you can slot into the back, with the matching lenticular cards to create a moving image of that game.</p><p>It’s 421 pieces, and given the quality and the nostalgic hit, could easily have cost ludicrous amounts. However, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.lego.com/en-us/product/game-boy-72046&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.lego.com/en-us/product/game-boy-72046" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">it’s up for pre-order—ahead of October 1 shipping—for $60</a></span>.</p><p>Right, now for those commercials. In 1989, when the Game Boy was arriving in the United States, the most wonderfully corny ad was launched in which a teenage boy and a robot, seemingly stood on an alien planet, took part in some sort of laser-shooting battle while also playing <em>Tetris</em>. You know, perfect.</p><p>This has been lovingly reproduced, with tongue firmly in cheek, for the Lego build:</p><p>While we’re here, we may as well enjoy those Paul Rudd commercials too.</p><p>Here’s the 1991 original, featuring baby Rudd:</p><p>And here’s the Switch 2 version:</p><p>.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://kotaku.com/lego-game-boy-pre-order-commercial-nintendo-1851786845]]></content:encoded>

As we wrote last week,</p><blockquote data-type="BlockQuote"><p> One of the real positives of Valve’s incredibly liberal approach to what it will sell is that it allows incredibly complex and difficult topics to be explored by brave developers. People regularly interrogate their own traumas through visual novels and interactive fiction, while others explore their sexual kinks via similar mediums. Victims of incest might want to create incredibly challenging games that process such experiences in healthy and productive ways—what happens here if it’s to turn out that “certain kinds” of adult themes includes such topics?</p></blockquote><p>On July 23, far more extreme moves were made by Itch.io, the colossal indie game store <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/itch-io-bundle-no-ice-in-california-table-top-rpg-1851786085&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/itch-io-bundle-no-ice-in-california-table-top-rpg-1851786085">best known for its massive fundraising drives for various causes</a></span>.

(You <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://store.steampowered.com/app/2359120/Consume_Me/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2359120/Consume_Me/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">can still find it on Steam</a></span>.) The game, a piece about disordered eating during teenage years, is a semi-autobiographical work that bravely explores a complex and difficult topic. Its developer, Jenny Jiao Hsia, responsibly marked the game as “adult” on Itch due to the sensitive topic and occasional semi-nudity, and as such her game is now delisted.</p><p>Collective Shout is an anti-porn Australian pressure group that has learned by applying pressure to payment providers, it can indirectly control the content of sites that depend on online payments. In response to their recent actions, carried out in the name of “challenging the objectification of women and sexualization of girls in media, advertising and popular culture,” <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.collectiveshout.org/gamers-threats-and-abuse&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.collectiveshout.org/gamers-threats-and-abuse" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">they have been inundated with wretched online misogyny</a></span>. Obviously many will be very receptive to their stated goals of protecting children from porn and objecting to games that simulate rape. Others will point out that the blunt tools of censorship do little to educate audiences, and inevitably lead to vast amounts of collateral damage.</p><p>It seems reasonably likely that <em>Consume Me</em> will return to Itch after the site’s “comprehensive audit of content,” given how egregious it is that it should be removed in any situation. But what about the games exploring topics related to gay sex by Yang? Or the thousands and thousands of other sex- and kink-based games that are now missing? <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://itch.io/updates/update-on-nsfw-content&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://itch.io/updates/update-on-nsfw-content" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Itch’s statement</a></span> says it plans to “introduce new compliance measures,” where NSFW games will be required to “confirm their content is allowable under the policies of the respective payment processors linked to their account.”</p><p>“This is a time critical moment for itch.io,” the statement reads. “The situation developed rapidly, and we had to act urgently to protect the platform’s core payment infrastructure. Unfortunately, this meant it was not realistic to provide creators with advance notice before making this change. We know this is not ideal, and we apologize for the abruptness of this change.”</p><p>Again, what is “allowable” according to payment processors is the most extraordinary deferment of responsibility, and of course an ever-shifting goalpost that developers can never be in a position to discern. Mastercard and Visa’s moral objections seem like the most bewildering standard to adhere to, and are already being wielded without any notion of nuance. What is the difference in the eyes of a behemothic financial corporation between a porn game about incestuous rape, and an introspective game in which a developer interrogates their own childhood experiences of incestuous rape?</p><p>“We ask for your patience and understanding as we navigate this challenging period,” says Itch of its sudden and sweeping move. “I’m sorry we can not share more at this time as we are still getting a full understanding of the situation ourselves.”</p><p>We’ve reached out to Itch to ask when the store will resume sales of games that clearly aren’t in violation of any standards issues, and to see if we can get any clarity regarding how developers are supposed to know what is “allowable” in the eyes of payment processors.</p><p>.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://kotaku.com/itch-io-nsfw-porn-games-delisted-collective-shout-1851786841]]></content:encoded>
