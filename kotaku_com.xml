              <p>Tau Ceti IV is sick and the only cure is stylish PvEvP extraction gunplay. That’s the vibe of a <a href="https://kotaku.com/marathon-runner-shells-trailer-abilities-bungie-2000660170">new <em>Marathon</em> trailer</a> that appears to have <a href="https://x.com/Mr_Rebs_/status/2013110010272682070">leaked on Xbox</a> ahead of schedule. While Sony plays whack-a-mole to get the new footage taken down, screenshots from it showing a March 5, 2026 release date have already spread across the internet.</p> <p><a href="https://streamable.com/ahh4d3">The new story trailer</a> includes a fresh sizzle reel of previously unseen gameplay showing off the sci-fi multiplayer shooter’s various maps, runners, and guns. There’s a healthy dose of the Bungie project’s exceptional art peppered throughout. But of most interest to casual players will be the nod to an early March launch date.</p>

  <p>Following its 2025 delay, the game only resurfaced with a vague March release window. This appears to confirm it’s coming at the early end of that range, giving Sony’s latest live-service game a few weeks to prove itself before the end of the fiscal year. According to <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/paultassi/2026/01/19/yes-the-leaked-marathon-preorder-and-release-date-is-real/">Paul Tassi at <em>Forbes</em></a>, the new trailer and final release date are accurate, with Bungie planning the official announcement to go live this week.</p>

 <p>There’s been some speculation among fans that Bungie will hold at least one round of open beta player tests before the game launches. If that’s the case, it now seems like a good bet we can expect those before the end of February. If so, it’ll be the last chance for people to go hands-on with the overhauled shooter for free before it arrives on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC <a href="https://kotaku.com/marathon-release-date-price-battle-pass-proximity-chat-2000653472">behind a $40 price point</a>.</p>

 <p><strong>Update: 1/29/2025, 11:04 a.m. ET:</strong> Bungie has gone ahead and released <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/marathonthegame.bungie.net/post/3mcrz6dqutv25">the official trailer</a> and confirmed the game’s expansive voice cast:</p> <blockquote><p>Krizia Bajos, Samantha Béart, Beau Bridgland, Ry Chase, Roger Clark, Darin De Paul, Jennifer English, Dave Fennoy, Nika Futterman, Morla Gorrondona, Reina Guthrie, Donnla Hughes, Keston John, Sohm Kapila, Rich Keeble, Elliot Knight, Erica Lindbeck, Piotr Michael, Brent Mukai, Neil Newbon, Ariana Nicole George, Emily O’Brien, Lee Shorten, Jason Spisak, Ben Starr, JB Tadena, Fred Tatasciore, Craig Lee Thomas, Elias Toufexis, Oliver Vaquer, Scott Whyte, Tracy Wiles, Erin Yvette</p></blockquote> <p>Pre-order pages are also up early for the standard, Deluxe, and Collector’s Edition pages.

              <p>First responders, including six fire engines, descended upon Rockstar Games’ Edinburgh office, Rockstar North, early on Monday following reports of structural damage to the offices of the <a href="https://kotaku.com/gta-6-grand-theft-auto-vi-new-trailer-rockstar-1851779300"><em>Grand Theft Auto 6</em> maker</a>. The result of an apparent explosion of some kind, the incident thankfully left no one injured.</p> <p>“We were alerted at 5:02 a.m. on Monday, 19 January to attend an incident on Holyrood Road, Edinburgh,” a spokesperson for emergency crews <a href="https://www.heraldscotland.com/news/25776012.gta6-dev-rockstar-north-building-taped-off-boiler-explosion/">told <em>The Herald</em></a>. “Operations Control mobilized three fire appliances and specialist resources to the scene, where firefighters worked to secure structural damage at a commercial building. There were no reported casualties and crews left the scene at 9:21 a.m.”</p>

 <p>According to Rockstar, the explosion was the result of a boiler malfunction and the studio remains fully operational as it prepares for the <a href="https://kotaku.com/gta-6-delay-may-2026-too-many-games-rockstar-trailer-2-1851778860">launch of <em>GTA 6</em> in November</a>.</p> <p>“Early Monday morning, there was a malfunction in one of the heating boilers at Rockstar North,” a spokesperson for Rockstar Games told&nbsp;<em>Kotaku</em> in an email. “Many thanks to those that reached out with concern, and also to the police and fire crews who were on scene quickly to assess the situation–please know that everyone is well and our studio remains open and operational.”</p>

 <p>The office has recently been at the center of an ongoing labor dispute with 31 fired developers who were <a href="https://kotaku.com/gta-6-rockstar-games-union-busting-delay-2000640525">trying to unionize</a>. The workers claim they were targeted for trying to organize while Rockstar maintains they were fired for violations of confidentiality rules, including leaking <a href="https://kotaku.com/gta-6-multiplayer-one-detail-leak-court-docs-player-count-32-rockstar-2000659780">development and gameplay details</a> in a union Discord channel with outside observers.</p>

 <p>A judge reviewing the case recently denied the fired <em>GTA 6</em> devs <a href="https://kotaku.com/rockstar-wins-initial-ruling-against-fired-gta-6-devs-we-regret-that-we-were-put-in-a-position-where-dismissals-were-necessary-2000658984">immediate relief</a> in the form of back pay, but a full ruling on the overall merits of the complaint is still pending.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/anker-clears-out-its-magsafe-charger-stand-at-its-lowest-price-charge-your-iphone-apple-watch-and-airpods-for-less-2000659479</link>
            <guid>1409992</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>The multi-functional, portable Anker MagSafe Charger Stand powers your iPhone, Apple Watch, and AirPods simultaneously in one location. This compact cube connects to an outlet via a single USB-C AC adapter connection and can be easily placed on any available desktop or nightstand. On top of the stand is a fold-down charger for an Apple Watch, and on the bottom of the unit is a designated area for wireless charging cases for AirPods. Plus, you can fold up the entire unit and take it with you if needed.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6773/">Go to Amazon to purchase the Anker 3-in-1 Multi-Device Wireless Charging Stand for just $97, saving $53 and reducing the price by approximately 35% from the original $150.</a></p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6773/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2><span>Set it on your desktop, charge everything, and forget about it </span></h2>
<p><span>The design of Anker’s 3-in-1 multi-device wireless charging stand allows you to place your iPhone in a horizontal position to view your screen, and place your Apple Watch on top of the unit and your wireless charging case for AirPods at the bottom, all in a relatively uncluttered manner. In addition, the iPhone portion of the unit is adjustable, allowing you to view your screen in both portrait and landscape orientations. Also, the stand is collapsible and can fit in a small drawer or travel pouch when collapsed.</span></p>
<p>As part of the Anker MagSafe wireless charging system, the unit supports MagSafe-compatible iPhone models with up to 15 watts of fast wireless charging. The internal magnets ensure the iPhone lines up correctly and that you don’t have to slide it around to find the optimal charging spot every time. The charging dock for your iPhone holds it steady in either portrait or landscape orientation, allowing you to view your screen while it charges.</p>



<p>Support for Apple Watches is extensive, covering most models. The raised platform for the watch allows the bands to hang naturally, and the back of the watch rests on the charging surface, eliminating the need to bend your watch straps into awkward positions. The base of the unit includes a pad specifically designed for wireless charging cases for AirPods, providing a specific charging location for your earbuds rather than forcing you to share the space with your iPhone.</p>
<p>A major advantage of this wireless charging stand’s travel-friendly design is that it can be used even when you don’t have access to multiple outlets. Closed, the unit appears to be a standard small black plastic box with a single USB-C port on the side so that it won’t snag on anything else in your backpack or carry-on. When opened next to a bed or on a small table, it eliminates the need for three separate charging stations while requiring only a single outlet.</p>
<p>Ready-to-go out-of-the-box accessories make using the Anker 3-in-1 MagSafe Wireless Charging Stand a breeze. Included with the unit are the 3-in-1 charging dock, a 30-watt USB-C wall adapter, and a five-foot-long USB-C to USB-C cable. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6773/">For the low price of $97, reduced from the original $150, you’re receiving a compact charging dock that wirelessly charges your iPhone, Apple Watch, and AirPods with a single cable.</a></p>
