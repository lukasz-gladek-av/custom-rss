It’s the most recent game from the video game auteur Hideo Kojima, known for games like the genre-defining stealth series, <em>Metal Gear Solid</em> and it’s on sale on Steam at the moment! <strong>You’ve got till November 11 to pick up </strong><em><strong>Death Stranding Director’s Cut </strong></em><strong>for $20 on Steam, and I think it’s the perfect game for the moment.</strong></p><p>In <em>Death Stranding, </em>you play as Sam Porter Bridges, a sort of post-apocalyptic delivery man who’s tasked with trekking across the ruins of the United States of America, reconnecting the various cities and settlements you find via the erection of new infrastructure, and healing a fragmented nation. I don’t know exactly why, but something about that just feels so resonant and timely.</p><p>In <em>Death Stranding</em>, you literally walk across the country. It’s kind of abridged, because <em>that </em>version of this game would take even longer than <em>Death Stranding </em>currently is, but that is the literal goal here. There are alternative ways of traveling, including zipines that you can establish, as well as vehicles that you can eventually unlock, but the main thing you will do in <em>Death Stranding </em>is walk across plains, hike up mountains, and stumble into creeks and rivers. If you’ve ever wanted to touch grass from the safety of your bed or couch, this is the game for you.<br></p><p>When <em>Death Stranding </em>was first released in 2019, it wasn’t the most popular thing in the world. Many balked at the thought of Kojima making a game that’s essentially one big “walking simulator,” a term that’s been thrown around derogatorily for years. Though Kojima’s narratives and characters are often larger than life, <em>Death Stranding</em> appeared to steer more into the esoteric than fans of his were willing to entertain, with hokily named folks like Die-Hardman taking up significant space. Despite the fact that <em>Death Stranding </em>did feature stealth, combat, celebrities from film and TV, as well as some major set pieces, it didn’t land with the impact of a typical Kojima game, and was even viewed as a bit of a rogue move from the esteemed developer.</p><p>As always though, Kojima was simply a bit <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/video-games-innovative-gta3-skyrim-1850976541&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/video-games-innovative-gta3-skyrim-1850976541">ahead of his time</a></span>. This is after all the guy responsible for countless prescient <em>Metal Gear Solid </em>titles, specifically <em>Sons of Liberty </em>and <em>Guns of the Patriots</em>. The year after <em>Death Stranding</em>—a game about the isolation bred from the increasingly polarized political attitudes in the world, as well as a pandemic-like cataclysm—COVID-19 upended the lives of everyone around the world, initiating a global shutdown and plummeting society into a deeply isolating and dark period in our history. As people began to note the parallels between our own nightmare of a reality and the world of <em>Death Stranding</em>, the game outgrew its oddball status, took on cult acclaim, and now there’s even a <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/death-stranding-2-release-date-trailer-tgs-2024-panel-1851660760&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/death-stranding-2-release-date-trailer-tgs-2024-panel-1851660760">weird-ass sequel</a></span> on the way.</p><p>Now it’s timely all over again for, y’know, <em>other </em>reasons. Reasons for which it was also timely this time four years ago. Maybe we all ought to sit down with <em>Death Stranding </em>and learn a thing or two from Sam Bridges so that we can sidestep the cataclysms in our own lives.</p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

They’re just deep<em> Harry Potter </em>fans, and we try to build authentic experiences to delight them.”</p><p> Those experiences include <em>Hogwarts Legacy 2</em>, which, while not officially announced yet, is a “one of the biggest priorities” for the publisher, and an HBO series that will give the original books the <em>Game of Thrones </em>treatment. Here’s an excerpt from the<em> Variety</em> piece:</p><blockquote data-type="BlockQuote"><p>Haddad says the games team has been coordinating some of the big-picture storytelling elements in the “Hogwarts Legacy” sequel with the storylines that will play out in the “Harry Potter” HBO series coming from Warner Bros. Television. He notes that the success of “Hogwarts Legacy” helped stoke confidence that the time was right to make a major Potter push: “The rest of the company was very curious about what we helped to unlock with ‘Hogwarts Legacy’ last year.”</p></blockquote><p>Warner Bros. Discovery CEO David Zazlav <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://deadline.com/2024/09/harry-potter-tv-series-max-release-date-cast-1235323284/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://deadline.com/2024/09/harry-potter-tv-series-max-release-date-cast-1235323284/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">confirmed earlier this year</a></span> that the plan was for the <em>Harry Potter </em>TV show to hit in 2026, with casting for main characters like Hermione Granger and Ron Weasley already underway. <em>Hogwarts Legacy 2</em>, meanwhile, seems unlikely to arrive until 2027 or 2028 at the earliest as big-budget games continue development timelines of 4-6 years and beyond. </p><p>The original game takes place in the 1890s, and while it’s not clear when a sequel would be set, it would likely be laying the groundwork for the particular flavor of <em>Hogwarts</em>’ history to be referenced in the TV remake, no doubt with Marvel-style easter eggs to pull fans from one to the other. </p><p>As for J.K. Rowling’s ongoing involvement in <em>Harry Potter</em>, Haddad said that while she is not directly involved in any planning related to the universe outside of the books, the controversy-courting YA author is still kept in the loop. “If we’re going to ever go beyond a canon conversation, we make sure that we’re all comfortable with what we’re doing,” Robert Oberschelp, Warner Bros.

I mean this as a compliment. This short narrative game from developer Wrong Organ is an emotionally and mentally taxing game with a clear story to tell. It might not be the easiest game to get through at times due to its tough themes, but it’s remarkable nonetheless and stands out as one of this year’s best games.</p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="196646" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="Dragon’s Dogma 2’s New Class Is A Twirling Death Machine" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="137" data-playlist="196646,196215,196055" data-current="196646"><div><p>Dragon’s Dogma 2’s New Class Is A Twirling Death Machine</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196646/196646_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196646/196646_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196646/196646_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196646/196646_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/22202.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>Despite what <em>Mouthwashing</em>’s first sequence may suggest, this isn’t really a horror game that thrives on adrenaline pumping jump scares. After running through the twisting halls of a spaceship, chased by a horse mascot, the game turns into something much more surreal and narratively dense. You will be introduced to the five person crew of the freighter ship <em>Tulpar, </em>which has been stranded in space with no hope of rescue after the captain (Curly) nearly destroyed the ship in the midst of a mental breakdown. That leaves him and the four other crew members of the <em>Tulpar</em> left to deal with their own existential crises over the likelihood of their impending deaths. </p><p>This is, to say the least, a pretty big bummer of a plot. It’s also a set up for what becomes a surrealist trip through each crew member’s lives, hopes, and struggles. While the game loosely guides you through its walking simulator-esque structure, the writing sharply dissects each character and puts their insides on display for you. You’ll come to empathize with the nervous nurse Anya, the young intern Daisuke, and even the grouchy elder Swansea.</p><figure id="" data-id="ccae7fb1757c216bf5cc361aa128cb0a" data-recommend-id="image://ccae7fb1757c216bf5cc361aa128cb0a" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="720" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A woman sits at a table surrounded by mouthwash with on-screen text that reads &quot;Jimmy: You thinking about drinking that too?&quot;" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A woman sits at a table surrounded by mouthwash with on-screen text that reads &quot;Jimmy: You thinking about drinking that too?&quot;" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Critical Reflex</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="ccae7fb1757c216bf5cc361aa128cb0a" data-recommend-id="image://ccae7fb1757c216bf5cc361aa128cb0a" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="720" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A woman sits at a table surrounded by mouthwash with on-screen text that reads &quot;Jimmy: You thinking about drinking that too?&quot;" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>The two remaining crew members, Curly and Jimmy, will take up a majority of the game’s focus. Curly survives what appears to be a suicide attempt in the form of crashing the ship, but is now bedridden. Unable to speak or move, you interact with him only by giving him medicine. You do this in the shoes of JImmy, the co-pilot and current captain following the crash. Jimmy, at times, appears to be the only person on the <em>Tulpar</em> who still has some sanity. While the rest of the crew is coping with their imminent deaths in unique ways, Jimmy tries to hold the crew together. But <em>Mouthwashing </em>digs into Jimmy even further.</p><figure id="" data-id="afpvuwnfoibrncd6upmy" data-recommend-id="image://afpvuwnfoibrncd6upmy" data-format="png" data-width="800" data-height="88" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Spoiler warning graphic" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><span data-id="afpvuwnfoibrncd6upmy" data-recommend-id="image://afpvuwnfoibrncd6upmy" data-format="png" data-width="800" data-height="88" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Spoiler warning graphic" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>While not traditional horror, <em>Mouthwashing </em>still has hallmarks of psychological horror in its claustrophobic atmosphere and dark themes. In that way it evokes <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/silent-hill-2-remake-bloober-review-ps5-pc-horror-2024-1851665482&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/silent-hill-2-remake-bloober-review-ps5-pc-horror-2024-1851665482"><em>Silent Hill 2</em></a></span>. That comparison becomes even more apt when the truth about Jimmy becomes clear. Like <em>Silent Hill 2</em>’s James, Jimmy is not the hero he is made out to be. Rather, he is the root of the issues on board the <em>Tulpar</em>. By flashing between scenes prior to, during, and after the crash, <em>Mouthwashing </em>slowly reveals that Jimmy, not Curly, caused the crash in an attempt to kill the entire crew. This was in response to discovering Anya had become pregnant after he sexually assaulted her.</p><p>While Silent Hill 2 eventually forgives James for his crimes, and encourages the player to see him as a flawed but redeemable character, <em>Mouthwashing </em>takes no such approach with Jimmy. Despite living in his mind for the majority of the game, Jimmy is shown to be a disease amongst the crew who, even in his final moments, cannot take responsibility for his actions. As the game progresses, the slowly decaying state of the <em>Tulpar </em>and its crew members act as a reflection of Jimmy’s decaying mental state, which is further illustrated by the story’s structure becoming fractured and twisted as you progress. By <em>Mouthwashing</em>’s end, there is nothing that seems to be based in reality about Jimmy’s existence on the <em>Tulpar</em>. He cannot live with the reality of his actions.</p><hr><p>In a year of great games, many of them lengthy AAA RPGs that will take you dozens of hours to beat, <em>Mouthwashing </em>is a short but highly impactful title that you shouldn’t miss.</p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

There are plenty of criticisms to levy at the fourth entry to BioWare’s fantasy RPG series, such as its lack of choice continuity from previous games and Whedon-esque quips sprinkled through its dialogue. And if you’re a CRPG diehard, you’re probably not too thrilled by it pivoting hard into an action RPG. But most of the time, these criticisms are buried under (or wielded by) people who are being pretty blatant that their real issue is that <em>The Veilguard </em>features queer characters who are actively presenting as such. To which, I have to ask, have you played a <em>Dragon Age</em> game? If you think this is a sudden pivot, I’m doubtful we played the same games.</p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="196742" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="What Is Dragonsplague?

Even the attempts to intellectualize such criticism via claims that its “ahistorical” to include modern-day terminology like “non-binary” in a fantasy setting falls apart: <em>Dragon Age</em> is an entirely fictional universe with flying lizards and people with horns. Is there perhaps a discussion to be had about how the story of Taash, the non-binary Qunari party member who is figuring out their identity, was handled? Sure, but I think it’s probably queer people that are trying to have that conversation, rather than the ones who are calling it “woke” and dogpiling on queer people who so much as mention <em>The Veilguard </em>on social media.</p><figure id="" data-id="ec6f81203b3f011d40a3c4220cd6eaa8" data-recommend-id="image://ec6f81203b3f011d40a3c4220cd6eaa8" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Rook and Davrin talk on a couch." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Rook and Davrin talk on a couch." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->BioWare / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="ec6f81203b3f011d40a3c4220cd6eaa8" data-recommend-id="image://ec6f81203b3f011d40a3c4220cd6eaa8" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Rook and Davrin talk on a couch." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>But what I do want to address is the revisionist history that <em>Dragon Age </em>wasn’t always writing stories that not only included queer characters but actively engaged with their storylines in a way that built out the world of Thedas. The first game, <em>Dragon Age: Origins</em>, included two same-sex romance options in Leliana and Zevran, with both acting as conduits through which we learned about the intersections of sex, religion, and gender as early as 2009. <em>Dragon Age II</em> is one of the most prolific examples of the <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/video-game-romance-playersexual-baldurs-gate-dragon-age-1851253394&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/video-game-romance-playersexual-baldurs-gate-dragon-age-1851253394">“playersexual” romance</a></span> that makes all its romance options bisexual. <em>Dragon Age: Inquisition</em> has an entire questline about a gay man nearly being subjected to a magical form of conversion therapy, while also including the series’ first exclusively gay companions and a prominent trans side character. Each of these games has progressively included queer characters and, perhaps even more notably, queer struggle within its world. Having a trans party member and the ability to <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/dragon-age-veilguard-trans-choice-rook-gender-pronouns-1851682607&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/dragon-age-veilguard-trans-choice-rook-gender-pronouns-1851682607">confirm your protagonist is trans</a></span> is the natural progression of a series that has only gotten more queer as the real world has.</p><p>That progression of visibly queer characters and storylines has been in the face of years of pushback from prejudiced criticism. A lot of this came from people who claimed to be fans often believing that queer people getting roleplaying options were somehow taking away from straight people. This perspective ignores the fact that BioWare’s franchise has aspired to create an equal playing field for its queer players for years. BioWare even <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/dragon-age-ii-writer-eloquently-defends-the-games-sexua-5785306&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/dragon-age-ii-writer-eloquently-defends-the-games-sexua-5785306">responded to that line of thinking</a></span>, saying <em>Dragon Age II</em>’s free-for-all romances “are not for ‘the straight male gamer’. They’re for everyone.” <em>Dragon Age </em>is no stranger to queerness, but it’s no stranger to controversy surrounding it, either. Many of us who have been around BioWare’s orbit for decades have seen the way bigots have expressed faux concern as a thinly-veiled effort to strip <em>Dragon Age</em> of its queer legacy.</p><p>It’s funny to watch scenes like the above, in which Iron Bull has a frank discussion with Krem, a trans man, about how trans people are viewed in Qunari culture in the world of <em>Dragon Age</em>, knowing that <em>The Veilguard </em>would be having a trans Qunari wrestling with those questions themself. It doesn’t attempt to muddy the reality of what it’s talking about and even gives you a good slap on the wrist if you try to misgender Krem through your dialogue choices. It’s no less overt than what <em>The Veilguard</em> does. So what’s different now, 10 years later? The answer is not <em>Dragon Age</em>. In a way, it’s not angry bigots online, either. It’s the way the internet has allowed entire businesses to thrive on faux outrage by painting a video game as a boogeyman worth mobilizing against.</p><p><em>Dragon Age: The Veilguard </em>hasn’t even been out a week and it’s become such a minefield to talk about. As people who weren’t even going to play the game in the first place make it a battleground, it’s got fans of the series so resistant to criticism for fear that it will become ammunition for hateful people to use against it.</p><figure id="" data-id="65301cdb411d3698ae17568a839af85c" data-recommend-id="image://65301cdb411d3698ae17568a839af85c" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Rook sits with Taash and their mother at a dinner table." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Rook sits with Taash and their mother at a dinner table." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->BioWare / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="65301cdb411d3698ae17568a839af85c" data-recommend-id="image://65301cdb411d3698ae17568a839af85c" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Rook sits with Taash and their mother at a dinner table." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://aftermath.site/aftermath-hours-podcast-dragon-age-veilguard-review-controversy&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://aftermath.site/aftermath-hours-podcast-dragon-age-veilguard-review-controversy" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The internet is broken</a></span>, and when it feels like we have no power to fight about anything else, people resort to fighting about a video game like it’s activism. Those problems extend far beyond BioWare’s latest, but let’s not pretend the criticisms that <em>Dragon Age</em> “wasn’t like this before” are anything other than what they are. If you think <em>The Veilguard</em>’s portrayal of a non-binary character finding who they are, a protagonist capable of being explicitly trans, and a party of queer characters who are smooching between missions is in any way “new” for the franchise, you haven’t been paying attention.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
