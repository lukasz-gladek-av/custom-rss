But there are still fragile eggs to find and carry to camp. Even though it feels like a daunting task at first, the right skills and equipment can make it an effortless process. We can help you find these elusive objects and deliver them with no worries.</p><h2 id="h985846"><a id=""></a>Where to find Wyvern Eggs</h2><figure id="" data-id="9d773156db5a8b94c322a27a64aa64e5" data-recommend-id="image://9d773156db5a8b94c322a27a64aa64e5" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The player brings up the Scarlet Forest map, highlighting the location of Wyvern Eggs." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="The player brings up the Scarlet Forest map, highlighting the location of Wyvern Eggs." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Capcom / Samuel Moreno / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="9d773156db5a8b94c322a27a64aa64e5" data-recommend-id="image://9d773156db5a8b94c322a27a64aa64e5" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The player brings up the Scarlet Forest map, highlighting the location of Wyvern Eggs." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>You’ll need to climb up some trees if you want to find the eggs. <strong>Wyvern Eggs spawn on the second map level of the Scarlet Forest, within Area 11.</strong> This is a dragon’s nest for any Rathian or Rathalos that roam this map. You’ve probably traveled to this area while hunting either monster, as they’ll commonly move to this nest once they’ve taken enough damage.</p><h2 id="h985847"><a id=""></a>How to Deliver Wyvern Eggs</h2><figure id="" data-id="e38e8b6ad4fbb37727b30c1a70c94941" data-recommend-id="image://e38e8b6ad4fbb37727b30c1a70c94941" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A hunter carries a Wyvern Egg through a colorful forest and towards a red pop-up camp." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A hunter carries a Wyvern Egg through a colorful forest and towards a red pop-up camp." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Capcom / Samuel Moreno / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="e38e8b6ad4fbb37727b30c1a70c94941" data-recommend-id="image://e38e8b6ad4fbb37727b30c1a70c94941" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A hunter carries a Wyvern Egg through a colorful forest and towards a red pop-up camp." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Collecting eggs has its fair share of obstacles. For example, your movement is while carrying these things. You’re also unable to jump from most ledges or roll. Trying to do any of these will break the egg. As if that wasn’t inconvenient enough, <strong>picking up a Wyvern Egg can instantly aggro any Rathian or Rathalos on the map</strong>. They’ll fly right towards you and begin their assault, which will likely result in them breaking the egg you’re carrying.</p><p>Luckily for you, the right tools and planning will make this a trivial matter. Here’s what you need to pull off a Wyvern Egg heist:</p><ul data-type="List" data-style="Bullet"><li><strong>Ghillie Mantle</strong>: Equipping this will prevent any monsters from seeing you during the trek back to camp. More importantly, it also prevents any large dragons from being alerted by your theft. Keep in mind that they will begin hunting you as soon as the Mantle stops working</li><li><strong>Outdoorsman Skill</strong>: Although its description only vaguely mentions improving transportation, this cancels out most of the movement drawbacks. You’ll have faster movement, dodging/rolling available, and jumping off a ledge will no longer break the egg. The Ranger Jewel decoration is the easiest way to apply this skill. Otherwise, you’ll either need to collect Gajau fish to forge Gajau Boots or complete Alma’s glasses sidequest to forge Square Glasses</li><li><strong>Area 12: Northeast Pop-up Camp</strong>: One welcomed improvement in <em>Monster Hunter Wilds</em> is that Wyvern Eggs don’t need to be delivered to your main camp. This is arguably the closest pop-up camp with the relatively safest conditions. Area 7: Bower of the Great Tree is another option, but it frequently has monsters nearby</li></ul><p>You can take out any Rathian or Rathalos on the map first if you want the absolute safest egg trip. I suggest checking the map’s Environment Overview Forecast beforehand to make sure you’ll have enough time before another one spawns in.</p><p>Before we start, you’re going to want to set up a waypoint to the nearest Pop-up Camp. This will help if you’re not as familiar with the map or accidentally get lost moving through this giant forest. Holding L1/LB for about a second will cause your scoutflies to head towards the waypoint, leaving a visible trail for you to follow.</p><p>Once you’re in the nest, equip the Ghillie Mantle and pick up the Wyvern Egg. Head north where a long set of vines lead down to another tree top. You might need to be walking straight towards it to slowly climb down these, which is a common reason players get stuck up here. If you have the Outdoorsman Skill in your build, feel free to just run right off. Your hunter will safely land with the egg intact. Keep moving forward to find an even longer set of vines you can climb or jump off from.</p><p>Now that you’re on the ground, you’ll want to turn right and move towards the giant mess of mossy rocks. Follow the water that goes around the left of this, and you’ll see the Pop-up Camp as soon as you round the corner. You’ll successfully deliver the egg once you approach the camp and see an animation of you placing the egg down.</p><p>Your reward is 50 Guild Points, which admittedly isn’t a lot. Previous entries had special egg delivery quests, so it makes sense that the rewards aren’t great without anything like that. Fingers crossed they add some in the future to give incentive for doing this. For now, it’s more or less a <em>Monster Hunter Wilds</em> easter egg.</p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Like other generative-AI tools, Midjourney is more or less indiscriminately trained on whatever data exists on the internet, no matter who it belongs to. </p><p>Disney and NBC Universal even reference a past interview with the company’s founder, David Holz. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.forbes.com/sites/robsalkowitz/2022/09/16/midjourney-founder-david-holz-on-the-impact-of-ai-on-art-imagination-and-the-creative-economy/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/robsalkowitz/2022/09/16/midjourney-founder-david-holz-on-the-impact-of-ai-on-art-imagination-and-the-creative-economy/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Asked back in 2022 by<em> Forbes</em></a></span><em> </em>whether it gets permission for any of the work it copies, he replied, “No. There isn’t really a way to get a hundred million images and know where they’re coming from.” The lawsuit alleges Midjourney made $300 million in revenue last year off of roughly 21 million users.</p><p> “By helping itself to Plaintiffs’ copyrighted works, and then distributing images (and soon videos) that blatantly incorporate and copy Disney’s and Universal’s famous characters — without investing a penny in their creation—Midjourney is the quintessential copyright free-rider and a bottomless pit of plagiarism,” the lawsuit reads. “Piracy is piracy, and whether an infringing image or video is made with AI or another technology does not make it any less infringing. Midjourney’s conduct misappropriates Disney’s and Universal’s intellectual property and threatens to upend the bedrock incentives of U.S. copyright law that drive American leadership in movies, television, and other creative arts.” </p><p>This is the highest-profile legal attack yet on a generative-AI company, following lawsuits by <em>The New York Times</em> and others against companies like OpenAI for copying written work. The outcome in court would have major consequences for the viability of a technology that companies like Microsoft, Google, and Meta are investing billions in. Without the ability to essentially copy the internet for free, the entire business model behind a lot of generative-AI and large language algorithms falls part. </p><p> “Midjourney’s bootlegging business model and defiance of U.S copyright law<br>are not only an attack on Disney, Universal, and the hard-working creative community that brings the magic of movies to life, but are also a broader threat to the American motion picture industry which has created millions of jobs and contributed more than $260 billion to the nation’s economy,” the companies claim in their lawsuit. “This case is not a ‘close call’ under well-settled copyright law.”   </p><p>  .</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
