              <p>Power outages, camping trips and outdoor events all share one frustrating problem:<strong> you need electricity where there isn’t any</strong> or you can’t rely on the grid to stay up when you need it most. Portable power stations solve this by packing serious battery capacity into something you can actually move around and <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5002/">EcoFlow’s Delta 3 just hit an all-time low of $519 on Amazon, dropped from its usual $699 price</a>. This <strong>1024Wh unit can power 13 devices simultaneously</strong>, charges from dead to full in under an hour, and uses LiFePO4 battery chemistry that’s rated for 4000 cycles over a 10-year lifespan.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5002/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Fantastic 1500W Continuous Power</h2>
<p>The Delta 3’s charging speed is what separates it from cheaper alternatives that take eight to ten hours to refill. EcoFlow engineered <strong>this unit to accept up to 1500W from a wall outlet and 500W from solar panels simultaneously</strong> which means you can throw 2000W of combined input at the battery. In practice, this gets you from zero to 100% in just 56 minutes when using both AC and solar input together. Even using just the wall charger alone, you’re looking at about 90 minutes for a full charge.</p>



<p>The battery itself uses LiFePO4 chemistry which is lithium iron phosphate, a different formulation than the lithium-ion cells in your phone or laptop. LiFePO4 cells are more stable, less prone to thermal runaway and significantly more durable over repeated charge cycles. <strong>EcoFlow rates the Delta 3 for 4000 cycles to 80% capacity</strong>&nbsp;which means you can fully charge and discharge this battery 4000 times before it degrades to 80% of its original capacity. That’s 25% more cycles than industry standard portable power stations,<strong> and it translates to roughly 10 years of daily use</strong>. The battery pack carries an IP65 rating, which indicates protection against dust ingress and water jets from any direction.</p>
<p>Capacity sits at 1024Wh. To put that in perspective, a typical laptop draws about 60W so you could run it for roughly 17 hours. A mini fridge pulling 100W would run for about 10 hours. A CPAP machine for sleep apnea averages 30-60W and would operate through multiple nights on a single charge. The <strong>1800W AC output means the Delta 3 can handle power-hungry devices like microwaves, coffee makers, power tools</strong> and space heaters. EcoFlow’s X-Boost technology pushes this even further by supporting resistive load appliances up to 2600W, though with some performance reduction.</p>



<p>The<strong> port options provide a total of 13 outlet options</strong>&nbsp;which come in various types. There are <strong>six AC outlet slots on the front of the unit</strong>&nbsp;which is more than what most of its contemporaries provide. However, this still won’t be enough if you plan on using all of your gadgets simultaneously. The <strong>USB-C port provides a total of 100W</strong> which is enough to provide a rapid charge for your laptop, tablet, or smartphone. There’s also a <strong>12V car outlet</strong> perfect for gadgets intended for use inside a vehicle. Additionally, there’s a DC5521 outlet.</p>
<p>Make sure you don’t miss that deal, it’s a record low price for the latest EcoFlow power station.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/sony-quietly-liquidates-xm4-stock-at-new-record-low-amazon-just-sold-10k-units-2000639122</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/sony-quietly-liquidates-xm4-stock-at-new-record-low-amazon-just-sold-10k-units.1335403/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Noise-canceling headphones have become essential gear for commuters and travelers who need to block out the world and focus on what matters. Sony just quietly liquidated XM4 inventory on Amazon, <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3787/">dropping the price to $198 from the usual $348</a>, and the timing is interesting because both the XM5 and XM6 are on the market at nearly three times this price.</p>
<p>Here’s the thing though: the technological improvements between these new generations are minimal and most users can’t tell the difference in real-world use. The XM4 delivers the same<strong> exceptional active noise cancellation, 30-hour battery life, multipoint connection, and premium sound quality</strong> that made Sony the leader in this category. Amazon has already moved over 10,000 units at this all-time low price, and it’s easy to see why.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3787/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Industry-Leading Noise Cancelation</h2>
<p>The core feature that made the XM4 legendary is Sony’s Dual Noise Sensor technology which <strong>uses microphones on both the outside and inside of each earcup to capture ambient sound</strong>. The <em>HD Noise Canceling Processor QN1</em> analyzes this audio data over 700 times per second and generates inverse sound waves that cancel out unwanted noise. This isn’t passive isolation from thick padding, though the earcups do provide physical noise blocking too: This is active electronic cancellation that targets low-frequency rumble like airplane engines, train noise and air conditioning systems.</p>



<p>The noise cancellation levels on the Sony can <strong>now be adjusted by an additional 20 levels through an app,</strong> and gives you complete control over how much of the environment you can shut out. The ambient sound mode reverses this by letting ambient sound come in through the headphones, which can be useful if you need announcements in an airport or traffic direction if you’re on foot. Again, there are 20 levels of adjustment there. The <em>Quick Attention</em> mode can be activated by resting your hand on top of the right cup which will instantly give you ambient sound while reducing the volume of your music.</p>
<p>The <strong>battery life reaches an impressive 30 hours of non-stop use</strong> with active noise cancellation, which will take you through not one but multiple cross-country flights or an entire week of commuting. The quick charging function is a lifesaver if you remember too late that you need to plug them in before bed. Charging via USB-C will give you an additional 5 hours of use after just 10 minutes of charging. Charging from empty will take a mere 3 hours.</p>



<p>The <strong>touch controls on the right side of the headband</strong> allow all of your playback and calling controls right at your fingertips. Simply swipe up or down to change the volume, swipe forward or backward to skip tracks, tap once to play or pause playback, or tap twice to answer or hang up a phone call. The touch controls take a little getting used to if you’re accustomed to physical buttons, but after a day of using them, they become second nature. The voice assistant compatibility comes with both Alexa and Google Assistant which can be accessed by either giving it the wake-up phrase or by pressing and holding the touch panel.</p>
<p>Wear detection uses a proximity sensor on the left ear cup that <strong>automatically pauses audio playback when you take off the headphones</strong> and resumes playback when you put them on. This conserves battery life as well as ensures that you do not miss anything in your podcast or audiobook. The XM4 headphones come with multipoint technology that allows you to pair two different devices simultaneously. For instance, you can be connected to your laptop as well as your smartphone. The audio automatically switches from one device to another according to which is in use.</p>
<p>At $198, you’re paying less than many mid-tier noise-canceling headphones while getting performance that rivals anything on the market today, regardless of price.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/dyson-dumps-supersonic-hair-dryer-stock-now-selling-for-pennies-against-what-salons-charge-2000639117</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/dyson-dumps-supersonic-hair-dryer-stock-now-selling-for-pennies-against-what-salons-charge.1335397/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Professional blowouts at a high-end salon easily run $60 to $100 per session and if you’re getting your hair done weekly, that’s thousands of dollars annually for results that last just a few days. Dyson just dropped the <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4621/">Supersonic Origin hair dryer to $299 on Amazon, slashed from its usual $419 price</a>, and at this all-time low, you’re paying the equivalent of three to five salon visits for a tool that delivers the same professional-grade results at home for years to come.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4621/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<p>This isn’t your average drugstore hair dryer: The Supersonic <strong>packs Dyson’s digital motor V9 that spins at 110,000 RPM</strong>, <strong>intelligent heat control</strong> that measures air temperature 40 times per second, and <strong>Air Multiplier technology</strong> that amplifies airflow by three times.</p>
<h2>Changes the Way You Dry Your Hair</h2>
<p>The key motor element of the Supersonic is Dyson’s digital motor V9: This motor is a brushless DC motor which is much smaller and more lightweight than traditional hair dryer motors. Typical conventional dryers place the motor in the foundation of the unit but Dyson relocated this motor to the handle of its unit. The motor’s speed of 110,000 RPM has more than just show value: This speed powers an impeller which draws air into its chambers. The motor pulls this air into its chambers at a rate of 13 liters of air every second.</p>



<p>The Air Multiplier technology is taken from Dyson’s bladeless fans. The function of this technology is the <strong>induction of air from the motor and then amplifying it through a carefully created hole</strong>. This amplifies the air into a <strong>three times more powerful jet of air</strong> than the motor’s capability, but this air comes from a smooth airflow. For this reason, it becomes capable of drying your hair sections quickly without releasing it all over the place.</p>



<p>The area where the Dyson Supersonic differs from more affordable models is heat control: The unit comes equipped with a glass bead thermistor sensor located in the airflow that t<strong>racks the temperature of the air up to 40 times every second</strong>. This information is then used by the microprocessor to make adjustments on the fly to ensure it does not reach unsafe levels. High temperatures damage hair by breaking down the protein bonds which makes it brittle, dry, and easy to break. The problem with most conventional dryers is that it can often reach temperatures above 300°F which is damaging enough on its own: The <strong>Supersonic keeps its top speed below 230°F</strong>.</p>
<p>Another field that Dyson ventured into is acoustic engineering: The hair dryer is a device that has always been known to generate considerable noise levels. This happens as the motor, along with airflow, produces sound waves of undesirable frequencies that tend to cause irritation in human ears. Dyson’s design of the motor ensures the <strong>generation of sound waves of frequencies higher than 16kHz&nbsp;which cannot be detected by human ears</strong>. Additionally, Dyson provided an acoustic silencer in the airflow path which serves to suppress sound waves. The outcome is a hair dryer that produces less noise than its predecessors.</p>
<p>The Dyson Origin series has only one magnetic attachment which is the styling concentrator. The styling concentrator is used for focusing airflow which enables the user to dry or style his or her hair. The magnetic attachment system is an excellent design aspect of this series: The user can easily switch from one attachment to another without waiting for it to cool down or handling it with hot hands.</p>
<p>For only $299, you will be paying the price of five salon blowouts but you will be gaining so much more than that.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/anker-rival-baseus-100w-usb-c-charger-now-selling-for-pennies-on-the-dollar-2000639113</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/anker-rival-baseus-100w-usb-c-charger-now-selling-for-pennies-on-the-dollar.1335394/</guid>

              <p>The modern tech life means juggling multiple devices that all need power at different times, and there’s nothing more frustrating than watching your laptop die while your phone sits at 10% because you only have one charger between them. Baseus just solved that <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4261/">headache with their 100W USB-C charger that’s now down to $34 on Amazon, dropped from its usual $49 price tag</a>. This <strong>three-port powerhouse</strong> can charge your MacBook Pro, iPad, and iPhone simultaneously and at this all-time low price, it costs less than what Apple charges for a basic 20W charging brick.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4261/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Two USB-C and One USB-A Ports</h2>
<p>The two USB-C ports support the PD 3.0 protocol which is the current standard for fast charging on everything from smartphones to laptops. When you plug a single device into either the C1 or C2 port, <strong>you get the full 100W output, enough to charge a 16-inch MacBook Pro at full speed</strong>. That means you can go from dead to 50% in about 30 minutes, which is clutch when you’re running between meetings or need to top up before a flight. The 100W capability also covers the Steam Deck, iPad Pro and any other USB-C laptop that draws significant power.</p>



<p>The intelligence comes into play when you’re charging multiple devices simultaneously. Baseus has incorporated their own smart power allocation technology, BPS 3.0, in this charging station. The technology analyzes which devices you’re connecting to each port simultaneously <strong>then allocates the power according to the device</strong>. Let’s say you’re charging your MacBook Pro on port C1, your iPhone on port C2 and your wireless headphones on the USB-A port. The charging station automatically adjusts the power allocation among all three. Your laptop receives more priority and more current, your phone gets charged as quickly as it can, which is its safe charging speed, and your headphones get exactly what they need, which doesn’t mean it gets excess current.</p>



<p>Heat management is where cheaper chargers fall apart, sometimes literally. When you’re pushing 100W through a device the size of a deck of cards, thermal control becomes critical. Baseus uses gallium nitride technology which is a newer semiconductor material that’s significantly more efficient than traditional silicon. GaN components <strong>generate less heat and allow for smaller charger designs</strong> without sacrificing power output. But Baseus didn’t stop there: They incorporated their BCT cooling system (which stands for Baseus Cooling Technology) and it actively monitors the internal temperature in real-time. Better thermal management also extends the lifespan of both the charger and your device batteries, since excessive heat degrades lithium-ion cells over time.</p>
<p>The physical design is engineered well: <strong>The prongs can be folded flat into the device</strong>. As a result, you don’t have to worry about the metal pins damaging your other electronics in a backpack or luggage. Being slightly more than two inches on each side, it doesn’t occupy much space on a power strip. Moreover, it won’t occupy space in other outlets. Otherwise, you would be forced to use a laptop charger that’s the size of a small box.</p>
<p>For only $34, you will be charged less than a single dollar per three watts of its charging abilities, supporting all the gadgets you use.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/hp-laptop-with-office-365-drops-65-now-beats-even-the-cheapest-budget-laptop-on-price-2000639086</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/hp-laptop-with-office-365-drops-65-now-beats-even-the-cheapest-budget-laptop-on-price.1335379/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Looking for a solid laptop that won’t drain your bank account? HP just dropped one of the most aggressive deals we’ve seen this year on Amazon: The <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5001/">HP 14-inch laptop with a full year of Office 365 included is now sitting at $279, slashed from its typical $799 price tag</a>. You read that right, a 65% discount that makes this machine cheaper than most bare-bones budget laptops on the market. This configuration <strong>packs an Intel Processor N150, 4GB RAM, 256GB total storage</strong> and a full docking station with 8 ports. HP couldn’t offer such a steep reduction on their official site, so they’re quietly moving inventory through Amazon where the real laptop deals happen.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5001/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Why This Deal Actually Makes Sense For Regular People</h2>
<p>Most people don’t need a powerhouse machine that costs over a grand. You need something that boots up fast, handles your daily tasks without freezing, and doesn’t die halfway through your workday. This HP 14 checks all those boxes with surprising competence. Under the hood, y<strong>ou’ve got an Intel Processor N150 that can turbo up to 3.6 GHz</strong> when you need that extra push. That’s a <strong>quad-core chip with four threads and 6 MB of cache</strong> which translates to smooth performance when you’re juggling browser tabs, editing documents or video calling with your team. It’s not built for gaming or heavy video editing, but for work and light content creation, it handles everything without the annoying lag.</p>



<p>What’s more, you’re getting 4GB of DDR4 RAM which is honestly the bare minimum for comfortable multitasking in Windows 11, but it’s enough for most everyday scenarios like working in Office apps, streaming content, and managing emails. The storage solution is interesting because <strong>HP splits it between 128GB of internal flash storage and includes a 128GB Micro SD card</strong> in the package. This gives you 256GB total to work with, and you can keep your operating system and programs on the internal drive while using the SD card for documents.</p>
<p>The battery life is another strong point here: <strong>HP claims it lasts through a full day of work or study,</strong> and based on the specs and the efficiency of the N150 processor, that’s believable. No more hunting for outlets in coffee shops or lecture halls.</p>



<p>The connectivity is surprisingly good given it’s a laptop of this price: You get the benefits of Wi-Fi 6, which is the latest standard for quick and stable wireless networking. The port selection is genuinely impressive. There’s a USB Type-C port capable of 10Gbps transfer speeds, two USB Type-A ports for your legacy devices, HDMI 1.4b for connecting to external displays, and an SD card reader.</p>
<p>But here’s where it gets better: <strong>HP bundles an 8-in-1 docking station</strong> that expands your connectivity even further. You also get an additional USB Type-C port, an RJ-45 ethernet port for wired connections, two more USB 3.0 ports, both SD and Micro SD card slots, a headphone jack, and a 4K HDMI port. That <strong>docking station alone would cost you $30 to $50 separately</strong>, and it transforms this laptop into a legitimate workstation when you’re at your desk.</p>
<p>The laptop comes <strong>pre-loaded with Windows 11 Home S mode</strong>. Windows S mode is a stripped-down version of Windows that will not install anything from outside the Microsoft store. The good news is you can switch out of S mode for free if you need to install traditional desktop programs.</p>
<p>The best part of the <strong>whole deal is the addition of Office 365, an entire year of it</strong>. This costs a staggering amount of $69.99 annually: It provides users with Microsoft Word, Excel, PowerPoint, Outlook as well as 1TB of cloud storage via OneDrive. For a student or a professional using office tools, this itself provides an amazing amount of worth to an immense portion of the purchase price.</p>
