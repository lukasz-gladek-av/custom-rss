            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Last week, <a href="https://kotaku.com/borderlands-4-the-kotaku-review-bugs-pc-performance-ending-gearbox-ps5-2000627149"><em>Borderlands 4</em></a> received a Steam Deck Verified badge. This should imply that the game is a great experience on <a href="https://kotaku.com/valve-steam-deck-pc-console-switch-horizon-zero-dawn-re-1848628507">Valve’s portable PC</a>. But that’s not the case. And worse, Gearbox removed the option to adjust the game’s advanced visual settings on Steam Deck for some strange reason.</p> <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/borderlands-4-pc-performance-dlss-frame-gen-pitchford-gearbox-steam-2000625765">It’s no secret that when <em>Borderlands 4</em> launched late last year,</a> it had all kinds of performance problems on both console and PC. Patches helped a lot, but those first weeks were rough, with frequent crashes, FPS drops, and other issues making it hard to enjoy the open-world looter shooter. Since then, things have improved a lot. I’ve been replaying the game on PC and have had a great time. So I was hopeful that the recent news that <a href="https://x.com/Borderlands/status/2019094762159214993"><em>Borderlands 4</em> is now Verified on Steam Deck</a> meant it would be a great way to play the game away from my desk. Well, that ain’t the case at all.</p>

  <p>As documented by a few different channels on YouTube, <em>Borderlands 4</em> on Steam Deck is technically playable, but looks extremely rough, features plenty of input lag, runs poorly at its default settings, and doesn’t at all seem worthy of Steam’s Verified badge. That’s supposed to signal to players that a game will be a great experience with no tweaking needed on the aging portable PC. But that’s simply not true of <em>Borderlands 4</em> on Steam Deck.</p>  <p>But the weirdest part of <em>Borderlands 4</em> on Steam Deck is that for some odd reason, Gearbox has removed the advanced visual settings submenu from the game when playing on the portable PC. Yeah. I don’t know why Gearbox would do this, as it just makes it trickier for your average user to tweak <em>Borderlands 4</em> and make it possibly run a bit better on the Steam Deck. You can’t change the game’s resolution, shadow quality, draw distance, etc. It’s a baffling choice that makes an already bad way to play this game even worse.</p>

 <p>While Gearbox deserves some blame, I also think Valve needs to overhaul or update its Verified system. <a href="https://kotaku.com/steam-deck-verified-valve-ff7r-avowed-ninja-gaiden-2000637741">It’s becoming more and more common</a> to find Verified Steam Deck games that don’t seem to deserve that green checkmark at all. And as the Deck gets older, <a href="https://kotaku.com/steam-deck-2024-big-games-unplayable-space-marine-2-pc-1851669933">this problem is only going to get worse</a>.</p>

 <p>Seeing how <em>Borderlands 4</em> runs on Steam Deck might provide some insight as to why Gearbox and 2K have indefinitely <a href="https://kotaku.com/borderlands-4-switch-2-delay-cross-save-performance-2000628055">delayed the Switch 2 port that was announced ahead of the game’s launch</a>. Maybe that version will one day see the light of day, but if it does, I really hope it looks and plays better than what I’m seeing on Steam Deck.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Riot’s New Fighting Game Is Already Imploding As It Lays Off 80 Developers Less Than a Month After Coming To Console]]></title>
            <link>https://kotaku.com/2xko-layoffs-league-legends-riot-update-2000666998</link>
            <guid>1430521</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><em>2XKO</em> hasn’t even finished its <a href="https://kotaku.com/2xko-ps5-league-legends-fighting-game-issues-2000661845">first month out on PlayStation 5</a> and Xbox Series X/S and Riot Games is already cutting its losses. The<em> League of Legends</em> maker announced that it would be laying off 80 employees as the tag-teaming fight game fails to gain momentum.</p> <p>“I want you to know that decision wasn’t made lightly. As we expanded from PC to console, we saw consistent trends in how players were engaging with <em>2XKO</em>,” executive producer Tom Cannon <a href="https://www.riotgames.com/en/news/an-update-on-2xko">wrote in a new blog post on February 9</a>. “The game has resonated with a passionate core audience, but overall momentum hasn’t reached the level needed to support a team of this size long term.”</p>

 <p>Featuring fighters from <em>League of Legends</em>‘ Runeterra universe, <em>2XKO</em> employs beautiful cel-shaded animations and tons of flashy combos. But it seems none of that was enough to help it make a huge splash in the fighting game community when it came to PC in Early Access last October. The game hit its 1.0 launch and arrived on consoles last month, where it became the third most-downloaded free-to-play game across PS4 and PS5, putting it ahead of <em>Marvel Rivals</em> and <em>Highguard</em>.</p> <p>That sounds…not bad considering the game’s existing trajectory, but apparently Riot was expecting something much bigger. Or maybe it was always the plan to cut the development team in half after release as the<em> League of Legends</em> company struggles to find success outside of its hit MOBA.</p>

 <p>Cannon said that there are no plans to pull the plug on 2XKO,and its remaining team will continue updating the game and carrying through with its year-one competitive plans. “Ultimately, this decision reflects a shift in how we operate,” he wrote. “This isn’t a judgment on individual Rioters or a signal that the journey is over. We’re reshaping the team to give <em>2XKO</em> a more sustainable path forward.”</p>

 <p>Cannon acknowledged how bad the layoffs and the timing sounded. “I know this update will raise questions and concerns,” he wrote. “That’s understandable.” But he didn’t have anything more concrete to share to reassure fans.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/nioh-3-yamagata-masakage-boss-guide-tips-how-to-beat-2000666993</link>
            <guid>1430491</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><em>Nioh 3</em> is Team Ninja’s new open-world-ish Soulslike. All things considered, <a href="https://kotaku.com/nioh-3-the-kotaku-review-2000665666">it’s pretty great</a>. The action is top-notch. You can play a sizable chunk of the start of the game for free via the demo, which includes a prologue boss fight against Yamagata Masakage. He might kill you a bunch. You might end up thinking <em>Nioh 3</em> isn’t for you. But that would be a dumb reason to lose out on experiencing a very good video game.</p> <p>Plenty of players will have no trouble with this prologue fight whatsoever, but I’ve already come across plenty of recent<em> Nioh</em> inductees who have struggled. Here are some tips for skating past Yamagata Masakage.</p> <h2>Grind some levels</h2> <p>If you’re getting your ass kicked, go fight a bunch of guys until you have enough Amrita to get to level six or seven. Put points into stats like Constitution and Strength. You’ll also get better armor drops this way. There’s a Yokai right behind you at the last shrine before the Yamagata Masakage fight. Kill that thing a bunch to get some better gear.</p>

 <h2>Summon an ally</h2> <p>This is also where the game teaches you how to summon NPC allies at the little blue pools of light. You spend Ochoko cups to “call” AI-controlled Acolytes to help you. Doing so goes a long way toward making the Yamagata Masakage fight a walk in the park.</p> <h2>Memorize the attack pattern and stay out of harm’s way</h2> <p><em>Nioh 3</em> is a Soulslike which means you need to know when to watch, when to wait, and when to be aggressive. Yamagata Masakage only has a handful of different attack patterns and animations and you should be able to block them all without getting stunned and still have time to create space and recover your stamina before the next barrage. In Ninja stance, it’s extra easy to play keep away.</p>

 <h2>Master the Burst Counter</h2> <p>If you’re having trouble with this fight, the best thing to do is not to worry about chipping away at Yamagata Masakage’s health throughout the entire fight. Instead, keep blocking and maintaining distance until he uses his special attack that flashes a red glowing aura around him right before it lands. Hit the right trigger to stance-shift right at that moment to parry it. That’s called a Burst Counter.</p>

 <p>When successful, you can transition into attacking to quickly stun him. Get a three-hit combo in and then back off until the next time he glows red before his attack. You can basically block and Burst Counter the entire fight as long as you manage your stamina meter carefully.</p> <h2>Let your Acolyte do all the work</h2> <p>While Yamagata Masakage is focused on attack you and you’re soaking up all his attacks by blocking, your AI-controlled Acolyte should be tearing into him from behind. Easy mode! Just keep aggro-ing him while your friend does all of the work.</p>

 <h2>Save your Living Artifact to finish the fight</h2> <p>Filling up your Amrita Gauge throughout the fight will let you press Y + B/triangle + circle to initiate a powerful transformation in which you summon your equipped Guardian Spirit and can unload on the enemy until the short cooldown expires. You only have to get Yamagata Masakage down to less than a third of his life before the battle ends and he’ll flee. Just watch out for his attack change-up in the second half of the battle, where his red glow animation adds some extra delays before it hits.</p> <p>With these strats, hopefully you’ll be able to make short work of Yamagata Masakage and experience the first part of <em>Nioh 3 </em>which begins to open up exploration. From there you can do lots of stuff before taking on the game’s first real&nbsp;major boss: Jakotsu-baba. That fight is the game’s first real skill check, but you’ll have more tools in your arsenal by the time you get to it.</p>

            <guid>1430455</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>This year’s Winter Olympics have been some of the coolest to watch, thanks to some talented drone operators providing viewers at home and online with awesome shots of some of the Games’ fastest events.</p> <p>Drones with cameras have been used to record sporting events for over a decade now. <a href="https://youtu.be/wYFdh1w_n6M">But due to a dangerous near-miss incident in 2015</a>, drones have basically been <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2015/12/24/sports/skiing/drones-banned-at-world-cup-races-after-one-nearly-hits-marcel-hirscher.html">banned from most skiing and snowboarding events for years</a>. However, the tech has come a long way since that moment, and drones are smaller, more reliable, and safer than ever before. So the tech is a big feature of this year’s Winter Olympics presentation on NBC and other affiliated networks. The end results are <a href="https://x.com/nascarcasm/status/2020269499879158039">truly stunning</a> to look at.</p> <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">The greatest new use of tech for the Olympics is this drone view behind the women’s downhill skiers. The intensity and speed, can’t be grasped from any of the other cameras we’re used to. Excellent.</p> <p>Now give me that in Apple Vision Pro. <a href="https://t.co/EtqgTkeYFq">pic.twitter.com/EtqgTkeYFq</a></p> <p>— Lee Parayno (@leeparayno) <a href="https://twitter.com/leeparayno/status/2020713318475071563?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">February 9, 2026</a></p></blockquote>  <p>You don’t really understand how fast these athletes are going when you see them from a static camera angle as they rush down a mountain or skate across ice. But when a drone is flying right behind them, keeping up, it provides an incredible new look at these turbo-charged winter sports. Like, look at how fast this snowboarder is flying down the mountain!</p>

 <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">Drone Winter Olympics 🙌 <a href="https://t.co/qTjwMpiNIq">pic.twitter.com/qTjwMpiNIq</a> <a href="https://t.co/aniABheDmR">https://t.co/aniABheDmR</a></p> <p>— Eric Njiru ⚽️ (@EricNjiiru) <a href="https://twitter.com/EricNjiiru/status/2020462950935351803?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">February 8, 2026</a></p></blockquote>  <p>Or look at how quickly these speed skaters zip around the ice.</p>   <p>I’ll admit that I was nervous that the drones might cause problems for the athletes, but according to many, they don’t notice the buzzing noise, and as long as they stay safely away, they don’t cause any issues. These drones are also operated by skilled pilots who work alongside a dedicated technician and director to ensure the athletes’ safety while capturing these jaw-dropping views.</p> <p>“When a camera is chasing the athlete down the hill — right in front of them or right behind them — you truly get the sense of how fast they’re going,” <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/sports/olympics/2026/02/09/drones-winter-olympics/">said Michael Sheehan, the coordinating director for NBC’s Olympic coverage</a>. “That’s virtually impossible to capture with a wide shot shooting from the side. The drone coverage takes us to a place we’ve traditionally never been.”</p>

 <p>All I can think about while looking at these clips of drones speeding behind athletes is: I want sports games that look like this, please!</p>

              <p>The trick to most roguelites is your mastery of a particular deck or build. Whether it’s your cast of characters, deck of cards, or collection of spells, progress is gained as much from incremental additions as it is from your increased skill at playing that build. Chances are you’ve dedicated a huge amount of time to one specific build in <em>Slay the Spire</em>, or a preferred range of Jokers in&nbsp;<em>Balatro</em>, such that next time you head out you’re both better equipped and better acquainted to cope with the familiar path of enemies, challenges and incidents. <em>Mewgenics</em>, the latest game from Edmund McMillen and Tyler Glaiel, responds to this format by saying, “What if we screwed that all up and threw it in the trash?” Oh, and added, “And threw in as much toilet humor as we possibly can?” The result, I’m delighted to report, is really rather impressive.</p> <p><em>Mewgenics</em> (out February 10 on Steam) is a <em>Slay the Spire</em>-style roguelite but with turn-based RPG-like battles played out on a small grid. For each run you take a group of four kitty-cats, each with their own roll of skill numbers, who are then assigned a class before the run begins. You then make your way through an ever-longer series of maps, each with battles, mystery situations, random treasures and boss fights, using your crew of cats and their somewhat randomly assigned sets of abilities, until you’ve figured out how to combine them as an incredibly effective team. Win the fights, defeat the most distant boss, and you’ll return to your home to, oh no, have all four of them (if they lived) retire. They’ll never fight again. All those skills you learned, the ways you figured out how to allow them to buff one another, a particular one-two combo you found to be especially effective? That’s gone now. Time to start over.</p>

 <p>That sounds rough, but the point is, you managed all those things, gained all that ability, on that single run. You can do it again, with four different cats with different skills, and perhaps different classes (you assign cats with specific class-granting collars before you begin, picking from, say, Mage, Thief, Fighter and Hunter, with more collars becoming available the more you play), and find a whole new way for a new crew to come together. Once. Of course, at the same time that you’re still gaining all the knowledge, you’re still getting better at the game, just not perhaps in the way that’s quite so familiar.</p>   <p>You get more cats, by the way, through the magic of nature. After picking two cats from a mad scientist, leaving them alone together overnight can cause—well look, when a mummy cat and daddy cat love each other very much, they fuck and make a baby. And your retired vets (they hate that term) will breed, passing on their genetics to a new generation of battle-cats. So long as you have enough food to feed all the feline inhabitants of your home, you can keep on breeding as many as you wish, then pick four to take with you on your next adventure.</p>

 <p>Cats that are no longer useful to you are, um, given away. Via sewer pipes, to a range of unsavory types who want the cats for…look, it’s best not to ask questions. But give each of these unsavory types enough and they’ll bestow you with useful advantages: a bigger home, more food storage,</p>

 <p>And so it goes on. Play more, reach further, unlock more, play more, reach further, unlock more, in that idyllic cycle that marks the best of this genre. I have no doubt that&nbsp;<em>Mewgenics</em> is going to prove a massive hit, given it delivers in all those incredibly hooky ways while having a fresh approach with its constant new teams. This is made even more impressive by the sheer amount of variety on each run, with different mini-bosses appearing, new enemy types showing up, unique events, completely new sets of spells and skills getting assigned, and indeed brand new songs being performed in the midst of your encounters. Oh yes, it’s kinda a musical too.</p> <figure id="attachment_2000666941" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000666941"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000666941">© Edmund McMillen, Tyler Glaiel / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p>However, I do take issue with some of the design. It’s possible to get phenomenally unlucky in ways that seem to undermine the ethos of the game. Random events like the Sandstorm are absolutely ruinous to a run, where every battle sees swirling sand deliver one damage to every character in the battle every round. That sounds innocuous enough, until you’re in a position where your kitties are very low on health, and reviving any who have been knocked out likely only brings them up to one health. That’s an infuriating cycle to be stuck in, and it’s a persistent effect that ruins your whole run. Not least because replacement cats tend to be pretty much useless, at which point it all stops being fun.</p>

 <p>Combine a situation like that with a mini-boss that has a 50-percent chance of avoiding hits and a run of bad luck with that, and it feels so hopeless you want to give up. But this means wiping out your whole team, losing all the coins, food and artifacts they’ve gathered, and means having to breed more cats to set out again. When all of this happened to me, I was also low on food, and then for some godforsaken reason I had three nights in a row when the cats refused to breed. So, um, it’s time to head off with the four random strays and hope. You can’t actually <em>lose</em>, because at a certain point it just forces you to have four cats and the opportunity to go on a run, but eurgh.</p> <p>I encountered so much bad luck that I began to get too frustrated. There’s an attack that’s supposed to hit 30 percent of the time. I’ve seen it hit <em>once</em> out of maybe 590 billion uses. In my direst straits I ended up with a strain of genetics in my kitties that saw them born as “pacifists” and thus unable to kill enemies—that’s a problem. Coincidences, terrible strings of coin-flips, and enemies deciding to take seven turns in a row start racking up to the point where I was just the helpless victim of the game’s RNG, in a game where the odds are already deliberately stacked against you. I started resenting <em>Mewgenics</em> instead of enjoying it.</p> <figure id="attachment_2000666943" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000666943"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000666943">© Edmund McMillen, Tyler Glaiel / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p>Like I say, this isn’t a condemnation of the game—it’s very obviously an extremely good one, and it delivers on its goals in vast bucketfuls. It’s wonderfully drawn, incredibly silly, and amazingly inventive. And it has so many completely fabulous songs. And look at the top: this isn’t a review! It’s up to someone willing to dedicate the hundred or more hours this game seems to need to write that. Me, I just got a bit fed up of its brutality after a bit, and while I’m still afflicted by a desire for “just one more go,” I’m also a bit cross with it too.</p>

 <p>I’m so interested to see how its toilet humor lands. It’s&nbsp;<em>so</em> childish in all the best ways, with incessant poop and pee gags, splendidly unpleasant depictions of cats rutting, giving birth, and eating one another, and even songs to go with such moments (I don’t know if it’s called “Cannibal Kitty” but that’s my favorite). It also has scenarios in which your cats can choose to eat human fetuses, spiders that crawl inside enemies and eat them from the inside out, all sorts of delightfully gross-out stuff. Although, I should add, this is far more tempered than in previous McMillen games: it’s practically a work of maturity compared to <em>The Binding of Isaac</em>‘s sensibilities. Tyler Glaiel (<em>The End Is Nigh</em>, <em>Bombernauts</em>) must be a good influence on him.&nbsp;I’m fascinated to learn how the traditional audience for a game like <em>Monster Train</em>,&nbsp;<em>Darkest Dungeon</em>,&nbsp;<em>Dicey Dungeons</em>,&nbsp;<em>Into the Breach</em>, and so on will react to the crassness.</p> <figure id="attachment_2000666944" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000666944"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000666944">© Edmund McMillen, Tyler Glaiel / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p>I also think I would have a&nbsp;<em>lot</em> more time for&nbsp;<em>Mewgenics</em> if it were on Android and iOS. This feels like the perfect game to play on my Pixel tablet, where I’d far more comfortably while away time with a run here and a run there, rather than sitting at my PC. (Obviously the Steam Deck is an option, but not the same.) It seems a mighty odd choice to limit this to PC on release.</p>

 <p><em>Mewgenics</em> reveals a colossal amount of work that has gone into making it so incredibly variable, and it’s very rewarding with all the decorative extras that surround the core loop. Its humor will <em>definitely</em> be a miss for many, but I suspect its depth and difficulty will give many cause to rise above it and play anyway. I just need some time to calm down before I go back.</p>

              <p><span>From </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/magic-gathering-secret-lair-baldurs-gate-3-shadowheart-gale-2000665414"><i><span>Magic</span></i></a><span> to </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/even-trumps-pentagon-is-selling-rare-pokemon-cards-now-2000661388"><i><span>Pokémon</span></i></a><span>, trading card games are having a moment right now. Yeah, the popularity comes with some drawbacks like </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-store-poke-court-nyc-manhattan-robbery-donation-2000662652"><span>scalpers</span></a><span> and </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/sonic-magic-gathering-secret-lair-card-pre-order-drop-1851786245"><span>awful online queues</span></a><span>, but it’s clear that there’s a market to jump into if you’re putting popular characters and good art on pieces of cardboard. </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/suspended-hearthstone-player-blitzchung-doesnt-regret-s-1841191499"><i><span>Hearthstone</span></i></a><span>, Blizzard’s </span><i><span>Warcraft</span></i><span> card game, has existed as a digital game for over a decade. Is Blizzard planning on jumping into this booming business? Not yet, at least.</span></p> <p><span>In a roundtable interview on Blizzard’s Irvine campus that </span><i><span>Kotaku </span></i><span>was present for, executive producer Nathan Lyons-Smith and game director Tyler Bielman were asked if Blizzard had been considering bringing </span><i><span>Hearthstone </span></i><span>to physical card shops. According to Bielman, a lot of what makes the game special comes from qualities its digital platform enables that can’t be replicated with real cards, and the team is wary of losing some of those elements in translation.</span></p>

 <blockquote><p><span>I’ll start with, we have nothing to announce today. The team [has many] big physical TCG players. I came from physical TCGs; our friends at Riot and </span><i><span>Riftbound </span></i><span>are having a moment. It’s great for them. From the very beginning, our “founding fathers” of </span><i><span>Hearthstone </span></i><span>asked the question of, “What if you could remove all the pain points from physical play?” and, at that point, kind of looking at </span><i><span>Magic</span></i><span> as the foundational element, ‘[if you could] remove pain points around </span><i><span>Magic</span></i><span>, too?’ And they asked all these questions, and then they put this game together in a way that is [an] incredible digital [experience]. The things that we do, mechanically, that you can’t do on a tabletop, when we go to look at expansions and new mechanics, we value those really highly. It gets a little extra oomph from us if it’s something that is unique to the digital format. If you were to translate </span><i><span>Hearthstone </span></i><span>into a physical format, you would be sacrificing a lot of things that make it special. Now that said, the core of what makes </span><i><span>Hearthstone </span></i><span>a great game is pretty universal and very accessible, and that’s why we believe it’s been around for 12 years, but I think that we would lose so much in that translation, we would have to be really careful about defining for ourselves what makes </span><i><span>Hearthstone </span></i><span>great in the minds of all the players and then how much of that could we recapture if we take it to a different platform at all.</span></p></blockquote> <p><span>Lyons-Smith added that Blizzard wants </span><i><span>Hearthstone </span></i><span>to be positioned as the “best digital card game,” and that is the team’s focus, but also said that the company has been around for 35 years and a lot has changed in that time, so the company has a “long horizon” of research and development that it’s exploring. So while it has “nothing to announce” and “nothing actually even in development,” the team is happy to see the card game genre growing.</span></p> <p><span>Today, Blizzard held its </span><i><span>Hearthstone </span></i><span>Spotlight presentation that laid out the game’s incoming updates, including an update based on </span><i><span>World of Warcraft</span></i><span>’s </span><i><span>Cataclysm </span></i><span>expansion, which you can watch below:</span></p>
