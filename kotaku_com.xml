              <p>More cuts are happening at Ubisoft. The company has confirmed layoffs at Ubisoft Toronto, the studio behind games like <em>Watch Dogs, Splinter Cell Blacklist,</em> and <em>Far Cry 6. </em>But don’t worry, that long-in-development-and-still-totally-happening <em>Splinter Cell</em> remake is fine, okay?</p> <p>On February 19, <a href="https://mobilesyrup.com/2026/02/19/ubisoft-toronto-layoffs-splinter-cell-remake-development/">as first reported by <em>MobileSyrup</em>,</a> layoffs hit Ubisoft Toronto as the company continues to cut costs as part of <a href="https://kotaku.com/ubisoft-earnings-layoffs-delays-canceled-ai-2000661869">a larger corporate restructure</a>. That process started last year following an infusion of <a href="https://kotaku.com/ubisoft-tencent-assassins-creed-far-cry-rainbow-six-1851772796">$1.25 billion from Tencent</a> that saw the company assume shared control over some of Ubisoft’s key franchises, like <em>Assassin’s Creed.&nbsp;</em>As part of this big shake-up, many Ubisoft devs have been laid off and multiple projects, including a long-in-development remake of <a href="https://kotaku.com/ubisoft-cancels-long-delayed-prince-of-persia-remake-black-flag-remake-delay-2000661866"><em>Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time,</em></a> have been cancelled. 40 developers were laid off, according to Ubisoft.</p>

 <p>Ubisoft confirmed with <em>Kotaku</em> that the <em>Splinter Cell</em> remake, <a href="https://kotaku.com/original-splinter-cell-being-remade-by-far-cry-6-devs-1848221698">first announced in 2021</a>, was still in active development despite the layoffs. That doesn’t really provide me with any confidence that the game will eventually ship, considering what happened to the <em>Prince of Persia</em> remake earlier this year. And now it will have to be made with even fewer people to help.</p> <p>“Following the recent announcement of the final phase of Ubisoft’s global cost-savings plan and the discontinuation of projects, Ubisoft Toronto will be reducing its workforce by 40 roles. This decision was not taken lightly and does not in any way reflect the talent, dedication, or contributions of the individuals affected. Our priority now is to support them through this transition with comprehensive severance packages and robust career placement assistance,” said Ubisoft in a statement shared with <em>Kotaku</em>.</p>

 <p>Ubisoft also confirmed with <em>Kotaku</em> that the studio will continue supporting projects such as <em>Rainbow Six</em> as a co-developer. In an internal employees-only email shared with <em>MobileSyrup</em>, the company explained that Ubisoft Toronto will remain a “key contributor to several codev mandates and service teams.”</p>

              <p>Mamma mia, there’s a new <em>Mario</em> game available to play today. But before you get too excited, you should know that the just-released<em> Hello, Mario&nbsp;</em>isn’t a 3D or 2D platformer, sports game, or other zany spin-off. Instead, it’s a small app that lets kids play around with Mario’s face until he gets tired and goes to sleep, forcing your child to do something else, like load up TikTok.</p> <p>On February 19, <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/store/products/hello-mario-switch/">Nintendo released <em>Hello, Mario</em> on Android, iOS, Switch, and Switch 2</a>. It’s less of a game and more of an interactive digital kids’ toy starring everyone’s favorite hopping plumber, Mario. Or at least his face. Players can yank on different parts of Mario’s head and face to get different reactions while also stretching the famed platformer in odd-looking ways. You can also tap on different parts of his head to give him sunglasses, play peek-a-boo, or even run a comb through his moustache. It’s similar to how you could mess with Mario’s head in <em>Super Mario 64</em>, if a bit less charming.</p>

  <p>At one point, I yanked on Mario’s nose and right ear, pulling them violently in different directions, and he shouted, “Oh, yeah, Mario Time!” I didn’t realize Mario was into this kind of stuff. We learn something new about him in each game, y’know? Anyway, after about 12 minutes, Mario stopped letting me squeeze and pinch his face and went to sleep. This is a feature Nintendo says will help limit screentime for your kids. But you can just do something else on the phone or even restart the app, and he’ll be up and ready to go again.</p> <p><em>Hello, Mario </em>is <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/my-mario/">part of a new brand line from Nintendo called “My Mario.”</a> Here’s how Nintendo describes this line:</p>

 <blockquote><p>The My Mario collection is thoughtfully designed to bring smiles to the faces of young children, their parents, and caregivers while inspiring imaginative play. Select items have been developed in collaboration with a range of licensed partners, including Fisher-Price and TOMY.</p></blockquote> <p>That’s nice, but this really just feels like Nintendo trying to turn babies into good, loyal fans of Mario as soon as possible. It reminds me of the stuff Disney and other big media companies have been doing for years now by slapping their characters on baby food, diapers, tiny toys, etc. Get them hooked on some IP before they can even say their first word. Smart business. But also kinda gross.</p>
