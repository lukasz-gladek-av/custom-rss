Here’s that trailer, which you might have missed if you were watching as it got somewhat buried under all the <em>other </em>big reveals of the night. </p><p>If you’re a <em>Turok</em> fan like me, after watching this trailer your probably had a similar question: Wait, this is a third-person shooter?

However, I loved <em>Space Marine 2</em>, so I’m still excited to play <em>Turok: Origins</em>. </p><p>As for just how this latest <em>Turok </em>ties into the bigger franchise, Saber Interactive isn’t ready to say, but does suggest it will have some connections.

I love movies and games about isolation. I think, in my ideal reality, I’d be aimlessly floating in a little space station, with excellent wifi and perhaps a module for my wife and kid. When I see such circumstances represented in games, I’m always absolutely intrigued. From <em>No Man’s Sky</em> to <em>Subnautica</em> to <em>Raft</em> to 2008's <em>Minecraft </em>even, I’m so drawn into the serenity of solitude. And despite having a name I cannot remember thirteen seconds after last typing it, <em>Intergalactic: The Heretic Prophet</em> immediately gave me those same vibes.</p><p>It’s not a genre vibe, I should add. Clearly this looks like a fighty-fighty game that sees you battling evil robots, rather than some sort of survival sim. It’s just about being someone who’s content with their own company. A misanthrope? No, not quite. Let’s go with “introvert.”</p><p>I also just instantly liked the character. Apparently she’s called Jordan A. Mun, a bounty hunter, clearly pursuing an obsession that her agent wishes she’d leave  alone. The newspaper clippings on her ship show that she used to be part of a legendary band of criminals called the Five Aces, and among their number was the person she’s now chasing: Colin Graves, played by actor Kumail Nanjiani (<em>The Big Sick</em>, <em>The Eternals</em>). We can extrapolate that the gang broke up, and now she’s hunting them all down.</p><p>Mun, played by Tati Gabrielle, is just so immediately personable. She’s twinkle-eyed, gleeful in her refusal to follow her agent’s advice, and thanks to some stunning motion capture and art, conveys vast amounts about her character through the smallest expressions. I want to hang, except neither of us would actually want to hang. We’d nod at one another, then sit at separate ends of the ship.</p><figure id="" data-id="fd606d5d0f6ed4b790fa81502dbbcafa" data-recommend-id="image://fd606d5d0f6ed4b790fa81502dbbcafa" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1084" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A wall of newspaper clippings and a photograph of the Five Aces." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A wall of newspaper clippings and a photograph of the Five Aces." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Naughty Dog / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="fd606d5d0f6ed4b790fa81502dbbcafa" data-recommend-id="image://fd606d5d0f6ed4b790fa81502dbbcafa" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1084" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A wall of newspaper clippings and a photograph of the Five Aces." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>And while the hitting a robot with a sword element of the trailer didn’t exactly make me leap out of my chair in delight, I’m finding myself in the weird position of being delighted that this is a Naughty Dog game, despite my, er, not exactly enthusiastic history with the studio’s output.</p><p>In fact, when it comes to Naughty Dog’s games, I’m quite the downer. I absolutely cannot stand <em>Crash Bandicoot</em>—it seems like the anathema of gaming to me, a game in which you can’t see where you’re going and have to fail to progress: bleurgh. It’s <em>Rick Dangerous 3D</em>. Then, due to my being pretty much PC-only during the PS2/3 era, I totally missed out on the first releases in the <em>Uncharted</em> series. When <em>The Last of Us</em> came out I was intrigued, but then I instantly absolutely detested it. I hated it! Like, in a way I would normally characterize as somewhat problematic in a person!</p><p>I hated the way it so callously killed a child purely as a means to give motivation to some dullard bloke (<span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/the-last-of-us-hbo-tv-show-ps5-game-remake-episode-1849995987&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/the-last-of-us-hbo-tv-show-ps5-game-remake-episode-1849995987">I wrote about this in more detail a while back</a></span>), and I hated that it was a cover shooter at a time when <em>everything </em>was a cover shooter. I found it arrogant and irritating in the extreme! </p><figure id="" data-id="9520c21f7af69cbaac1b9f9ac2ef5a9b" data-recommend-id="image://9520c21f7af69cbaac1b9f9ac2ef5a9b" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Mun charges toward a four-armed robot wielding a giant glowy sword thing." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Mun charges toward a four-armed robot wielding a giant glowy sword thing." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Naughty Dog / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="9520c21f7af69cbaac1b9f9ac2ef5a9b" data-recommend-id="image://9520c21f7af69cbaac1b9f9ac2ef5a9b" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Mun charges toward a four-armed robot wielding a giant glowy sword thing." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Now, I’m not defending any of this as some sort of critical position. It’s pure emotion, a visceral reaction that is quite unlike me, and given so many people whose opinions and intelligence I love and respect enjoy the game so much, I feel sure I am missing out. (I’ll still argue that it was a grotesque, awful “fridging” though, and probably fold my arms.)</p><p>But I did eventually catch up on <em>Uncharted</em>, and big news: those games are great! I really enjoyed them! I had issues, and bloody hell, crates. But yeah, really lovely games, with—and here’s the key—fantastic, personable storytelling.</p><p>And it’s this that makes me think, “Actually, maybe I’ll bother to grind through yet more hitting robots with swords, if it means I get to experience acting as good as I saw in this trailer and a story deserving of that character, I’m in. (Shout-out to whoever is playing the agent as well—I loved her delivery so much too!) I’m ready to go. I have such good vibes! I want to be the cool space criminal bounty hunter who thrives on her own!</p><p>Of course, it could end up being be stinky-poops (a critical term you likely aren’t familiar with). I don’t know! No one does. Forming conclusions on this game after a single trailer would be perhaps <em>deeply</em> stupid. But if I’m going to allow myself a moment of vibes-based enthusiasm, of all the games in that teetering pile of commercials, this is the game that got me. I’m excited.</p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

The move followed <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj7LYwOjOX0&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj7LYwOjOX0" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">the infamous 2013 VGX disaster</a></span> in which Keighley hosted alongside a visibly bored and at times belligerently aloof Joel McHale. “Spike’s VGX Awards Evolve Into A New Kind of Mess,” read a <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.forbes.com/sites/insertcoin/2013/12/08/spikes-vgx-awards-evolve-into-a-new-kind-of-mess/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/insertcoin/2013/12/08/spikes-vgx-awards-evolve-into-a-new-kind-of-mess/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>Forbes </em>headline</a></span> from the day after. </p><p>After ditching the old format, 2014's Game Awards was immediately unburdened by legacy media’s condescending antics around trying to get everyday people to “care” about games and instead took aim more squarely at the fans who already understood why they were cool, exciting, and on the cusp of radically evolving (the show happened to include teases for <em>The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild</em>, <em>No Man’s Sky</em>, <em>The Witcher 3</em>, and other modern standard bearers).</p><p>But the modern Game Awards were not built in a day or even a year. The event changed and grew in fits and starts, giving us plenty of beautiful moments but lots of cringe-worthy ones as well.

Winners were given more time to speak, if only a little bit extra. No one was visibly rushed off the stage. Even if half of the winners were announced in speedrun rounds between ads for other games, many still got a chance to be seen accepting their awards. Winners being seen and celebrated is, ostensibly, anyway, what all award shows are about, even if it’s the bare minimum of what they can aspire to. </p><p>Rather than launch into a screed against the video game industry’s greed or excess amid one of the worst years for layoffs in the show’s (and the industry’s) history, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-09-12/data-cruncher-moonlights-as-headhunter-for-video-game-workers?sref=P6Q0mxvj&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-09-12/data-cruncher-moonlights-as-headhunter-for-video-game-workers?sref=P6Q0mxvj" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Keighley ceded the floor to Amir Satvat</a></span>, a development director at Tencent Games, to honor his personal contributions to his industry peers through his tireless work documenting industry layoffs, updating a robust list of new job openings, and simply reminding other developers that when their life is upended, no matter how small the project they were working on or how unheard of the game studio that employed them is, there’s someone there, bearing witness and ready to offer help. It was not a radical call for unionization, but it is the closest Keighley’s show has come to reckoning with the destructive side of the brands it worships. </p><p>And of course the event brought the big announcements fans have been eager for. They got their first taste of<em> The Witcher 4 </em>and a peek at what <em>The Last of Us</em> maker Naughty Dog has been working on for years. Legends Fumito Ueda (<em>Ico</em>, <em>Shadow of the Colossus</em>) and Hideki Kamiya (<em>Devil May Cry</em>, <em>Bayonetta</em>) revealed new projects. There was more <em>Elden Ring</em> (a three-player roguelike spin-off), <em>Borderlands</em> (a new trailer for <em>Borderlands 4</em>), and <em>Helldivers 2</em> (a free update adding an entirely new enemy faction). </p><p>I haven’t mentioned the actual winners of the awards themselves much because they are never quite the point. Every game nominated  was more than worthy. While a culture steeped in leaderboards and score chases loves a winner, the event remains, first and foremost, about commemorating games through the sheer force of spectacle. Video game music being played in orchestra halls has more than a whiff of the old video game inferiority complex at work, but seeing <em>Balatro </em>music played live on a stage in front starving artists and CEOs alike is <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://x.com/NorthernIion_LP/status/1867436074504692071&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://x.com/NorthernIion_LP/status/1867436074504692071" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">an incredible moment nonetheless</a></span>. </p><p>And catharsis did come with the introduction to the GOTY winner. Vincke, returning from last year’s win to present the award to this year’s victor while sporting a ceasefire pin, elaborated on the remarks he didn’t quite get to give at last year’s show. In his preamble, he laid out his formula for GOTY success amid an industry of rising costs, insatiable profit motives, and endless incentives to copy someone else’s homework instead of try something new. </p><p>The studios that made games deserving of such an award, he said, “didn’t treat their developers like numbers on a spreadsheet. They didn’t treat their players as users to exploit. And they didn’t make decisions they knew were short-sighted in function of a bonus or politics. They knew that if you put the game and the team first, the revenue will follow. They were driven by idealism, and wanted players to have fun, and they realized that if the developers didn’t have fun, nobody was going to have any fun.”</p><p>This year was the best The Game Awards has been in a while, if not the best it can still be. Why is the award for accessibility still relegated to the pre-show? How come so many of the categories are still such a mess? Why do the actual awards still take up <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://bsky.app/profile/rajio.bsky.social/post/3ld6zxvoaoc2q&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://bsky.app/profile/rajio.bsky.social/post/3ld6zxvoaoc2q" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">less than 10 percent</a></span> of the show’s total run time? How come the finances around the show, unlike its voting process, are still all so opaque? There’s always next year, because as the viewership stats prove time and again, we will all be watching when the circus comes back to town next December. </p><p>My personal favorite part of the show was the <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/the-game-awards-2024-geoff-muppets-statler-waldorf-1851720364&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/the-game-awards-2024-geoff-muppets-statler-waldorf-1851720364">recurring bits by Muppets Statler and Waldorf</a></span>. They essentially voiced the most common online jabs launched at Keighley in real time. Ever eager to please, the showman took them on the chin rather than undercutting the humor by attempting a witty retort. Perhaps he’s learned that the best hosts are also willing punching bags for everyone else’s grievances. And the gaming industry, rightfully, has a lot of them. </p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
