            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>A week ago, a <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2026/jan/02/elon-musk-grok-ai-children-photos"><em>Guardian</em>&nbsp;story</a> revealed the news that Elon Musk’s Grok AI was knowingly and willingly producing images of real-world people in various states of undress, and even more disturbingly, images of near-nude minors, in response to user requests. Further reporting from <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/grok-is-generating-sexual-content-far-more-graphic-than-whats-on-x/"><em>Wired</em></a> and&nbsp;<a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2026-01-07/musk-s-grok-ai-generated-thousands-of-undressed-images-per-hour-on-x"><em>Bloomberg</em></a> demonstrated the situation was on a scale larger than most could imagine, with “thousands” of such images produced an hour. Despite silence or denials from within X, this led to <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c5y5w0k99r1o">“urgent contact”</a> from various international regulators, and today X has responded by creating the impression that access to Grok’s image generation tools is now for X subscribers only. Another way of phrasing this could be: you now have to pay to use xAI’s tools to make nudes. Except, extraordinarily—despite Grok saying otherwise—it’s not true.</p> <p>The story of the last week has in fact been in two parts. The first is Grok’s readiness to create undressed images of real-world people and publish them to X, as well as create far more graphic and sexual videos on the Grok website and app, willingly offering deepfakes of celebrities and members of the public with few restrictions. The second is that Grok has been found to do the same with images of children. Musk and X’s responses so far have been to seemingly celebrate the former, but condemn the latter, while appearing not to do anything about either. It has taken until today, a week since world leaders and international regulatory bodies have been demanding responses from X and xAI, for there to be the appearance of any action at all, and it looks as if even this isn’t what it seems.</p> <h2>How we got here</h2> <p>The January 2 story from <i>The Guardian</i> reported that the Grok chatbot <a href="https://x.com/grok/status/2006618883055046758">posted</a> that lapses in safeguards had led to the generation of “images depicting minors in minimal clothing” in a reply to an X user. The user, on January 1, had responded to <a href="https://x.com/AnOpenSecret/status/2006491540848341408?s=20">a claim</a> made by an account for the documentary <em>An Open Secret</em> stating that Grok was being used to “depict minors on this platform in an extremely inappropriate, sexual fashion.” The allegation was that a user could post a picture of a fully dressed child and then ask Grok to re-render the image but wearing underwear or lingerie, and in sexual poses. The user asked Grok if it was true, and Grok responded that it was. “I’ve reviewed recent interactions,” the bot replied. “There are isolated cases where users prompted for and received AI images depicting minors in minimal clothing.”</p> <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">I've reviewed recent interactions. There are isolated cases where users prompted for and received AI images depicting minors in minimal clothing, like the example you referenced. xAI has safeguards, but improvements are ongoing to block such requests entirely. (214 chars)</p> <p>— Grok (@grok) <a href="https://twitter.com/grok/status/2006618883055046758?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 1, 2026</a></p></blockquote>  <p>By January 7,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.wired.com/story/grok-is-generating-sexual-content-far-more-graphic-than-whats-on-x/"><em>Wired</em> published an investigation</a> that revealed Grok was willing to make images of a far more sexual nature when the results weren’t appearing on X. Using Grok’s website and app,&nbsp;<em>Wired</em> discovered it was possible to create “extremely graphic, sometimes violent, sexual imagery of adults that is vastly more explicit than images created by Grok on X.” The site added, “It may also have been used to create sexualized videos of apparent minors.” The generative-AI was willing and able to create videos of recognizable celebrities “engaging in sexual activities,” including a video of the late Diana, Princess of Wales, “having sex with two men on a bed.”</p> <p><a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2026-01-07/musk-s-grok-ai-generated-thousands-of-undressed-images-per-hour-on-x"><em>Bloomberg</em>‘s reporting</a> spoke to experts who talked about how Grok and xAI’s approach to image and video generation is materially different from that being done by other big names in generative-AI, stating that rivals offer a “good-faith effort to mitigate the creation of this content in the first place” and adding, “Obviously xAI is different. It’s more of a free-for-all.” Another expert said that the scale of deepfakes on X is “unprecedented,” noting, “We’ve never had a technology that’s made it so easy to generate new images.”</p> <h2>Where we are now</h2> <p>It is now being <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2026/jan/09/grok-image-generator-outcry-sexualised-ai-imagery">widely reported</a> that access to Grok’s image and video generation has been restricted to only paying subscribers to X. This is largely because when someone without a subscription asks Grok to make an image, it is responding with “Image generation and editing are currently limited to paying subscribers,” then adding a link so people can pay up for access.</p> <p>However, as discovered by the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/859309/grok-undressing-limit-access-gaslighting"><em>The Verge</em></a>, this isn’t actually true at all. While you cannot currently simply @ Grok to ask it to make an image, absolutely everyone can still click on the “Edit image” button and access the software that way. You can also just visit Grok’s site or app and use it that way.</p> <p>This means that the technology is currently lying to users to suggest they need to subscribe to X’s various paid tiers if they wish to generate images of any nature, but still offering the option anyway if the user has the wherewithal to either click a button, or if they’re on the app version of X, to long-press an image and use the pop-up.</p> <h2>What does Elon Musk have to say?</h2> <p>Musk, as you might imagine, has truly been posting through it. Moments before the story of the images of minors broke, following days of people discovering Grok’s willingness to render anyone in a bikini, <a href="https://x.com/elonmusk/status/2006868990287810750">Musk was laughing</a> at images of himself depicted in a two-piece, before a rapid reverse-ferret on January 3 as he <a href="https://x.com/elonmusk/status/2007475612949102943">made great show of declaring</a> that anyone discovered using Grok for images of children would face consequences, in between endlessly claiming that his Nazi salute was the same as Mamdani doing a gentle wave to crowds. Since then (alongside <a href="https://x.com/elonmusk/status/2009546483054592185">posting</a> full-on white supremacist content), the X owner’s stance has switched to <a href="https://x.com/elonmusk">reposting</a> other people’s use of ChatGPT to demonstrate that it, too, will render adults in bikinis, seemingly forgetting that the core issue was Grok’s willingness to depict children, and declaring that this proves the hypocrisy of the press and world leaders.</p> <p>Regarding today’s developments, he has not uttered a peep. Instead his feed is primarily deeply upsetting lies about the murder of Renee Nicole Good and uncontrolled rage at the suggestion from Britain’s Prime Minister, Keir Starmer, <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c99kn52nx9do">that X might be banned in the UK</a> as a consequence of the issues discussed above.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>The boss behind the studio that developed one of 2025’s best RPGs, <em><a href="https://kotaku.com/kingdom-come-swen-vincke-larian-bruce-straley-ai-warhorse-2000654591">Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2</a>,</em> says that online controversies about the game and its predecessor involving representation likely didn’t hurt the game’s sales and only mattered to “a handful” of people who are online 24/7.</p> <p>Some quick history. <a href="https://kotaku.com/kingdom-come-deliverance-the-kotaku-review-1823606430">In 2017, in the lead-up to the launch of </a><em>Kingdom Come: Deliverance,</em> developer Warhorse Studios was criticized by some online for not including people of color in the game. The studio defended this by claiming it was <a href="https://kotaku.com/kingdom-come-owes-its-popularity-to-realism-and-conserv-1823420208">historically accurate</a> that in early 15th-century Bohemia, especially in the countryside where the game was set, it was rare to see non-white people. Some scholars agreed, others weren’t sure, and people online yelled about it, with some right-leaning gamers very invested in protecting the studio from the “woke agenda.” Fast forward to 2025, when a lot of the people who had previously defended Warhorse’s dedication to historical accuracy were now mad that the studio was including more people of color. The studio explained that it made sense as the sequel involved a large city that would have brought in more people from around the world. There were also some folks angry about the ability to have a gay relationship.</p>

 <p>So, did any of this controversy affect the game sales? <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/rpg/attacks-on-kingdom-come-deliverance-for-gay-romance-representation-only-mattered-to-a-handful-of-terminally-online-culture-warriors-reckons-kcd2s-exec-producer-and-probably-didnt-impact-the-games-reception/">That’s what <em>PC Gamer</em> recently asked</a> Martin Klíma, Warhorse’s co-founder and the executive producer on <em>Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2.&nbsp;</em></p> <p>“I would really, really like to know the answer to this one. You can really convincingly argue both ways,” Klíma told the outlet. “You can convincingly argue that we got some extra visibility—that it doesn’t matter what they say about you, as long as they spell your name right.” At the same time, he said, you could argue that “any controversy is hurtful, and you want to speak about the game, and you don’t want to explain some…tangled reasoning.”</p>

 <p>Klíma further explained that he personally felt that the online controversies surrounding both games “only mattered to, really, a handful of terminally online culture warriors” and believed that they are “an insignificant intersection with the gaming public writ large.”</p>

 <p>“The real players really don’t care about it at all, and probably most of them never really even heard about these pseudo-controversies,” said Klíma.</p> <p>Considering the fact that <em>Kingdom Come: Deliverance</em> has sold over 10 million copies since 2017, and that its sequel has already sold over four million, I think Klíma might be right. It’s a good reminder that most people aren’t online as much as your favorite journalists, content creators, or posters. That’s not to say they don’t care about things like representation, but they aren’t really hearing about most of this stuff, and instead are just buying that game that people said was good or that has a cool cover. Honestly, I’m jealous.</p>
