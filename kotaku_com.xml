              <p><span>Last July was the cut-off date for major digital platforms to comply with the UK’s Online Safety Act (OSA). In an attempt to block access between minors and material deemed “harmful” by the government, platforms like Reddit, Spotify, and X began tougher age verification for their users, such as facial scans or, in some cases, even needing to see government ID. At the top of those <a href="https://kotaku.com/discord-age-verification-ai-hack-nitro-boycott-2000667358">stumbling to do so was Discord</a>, whose system is not only </span><a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/hardware/someone-has-already-made-a-free-in-browser-3d-model-to-bypass-discord-age-verification-that-works-on-any-potato-computer/"><span>easy to game</span></a><span> but also not impossible to compromise, with one major security breach </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/media/2025/oct/09/hack-age-verification-firm-discord-users-id-photos"><span>exposing some 70,000 users’ IDs shortly after</span></a><span>. Now Discord is </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/discord-will-force-you-to-scan-your-face-or-id-to-unlock-all-of-its-features-2000666884"><span>looking to enforce age verification globally</span></a><span>. A firm Discord at one point worked with to do so may be even more controversial than the decision itself.</span></p> <p><span>While the roll-out is aimed for March, </span><a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/software/platforms/oh-good-discords-age-verification-rollout-has-ties-to-palantir-co-founder-and-panopticon-architect-peter-thiel/"><i><span>PC Gamer</span></i><span> reports</span></a><span> that some Discord users have already been prompted for new age verification, this time using the third-party service Persona. Started in 2018, Persona develops identity detection and anti-fraud technologies. They’ve been having an absolute field day since the OSA, being implemented to verify user ID across Reddit and Roblox. One sticking point, however, is who’s backing the company: Peter Thiel, the cofounder of ICE-approved surveillance firm Palantir.&nbsp;</span></p>

The Founders Fund began in the mid-2000s and made key early investments in the likes of SpaceX, AirBNB, OpenAI and Polymarket. All your favorite tech things “disrupting” the modern world. And who would unleash such a monetary power unto civilization? Why, none other than your friend and mine, <a href="https://kotaku.com/hulk-hogan-sex-tape-gawker-lawsuit-kotaku-go-media-1851787000">the anti-humanist, antichrist-awaiting Thiel</a>.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>Thiel, of course, is known for many things. A co-founder of PayPal, Thiel is now more closely affiliated with Palantir, a company specializing in digital surveillance and exploiting user information. Palantir, named after the crystal balls that allow communication across Middle-earth in <em>The </em><em>Lord of the Rings</em>,&nbsp;has been around since 2003 but has kept plenty busy lately. </span><a href="https://www.404media.co/elite-the-palantir-app-ice-uses-to-find-neighborhoods-to-raid/"><i><span>404</span></i><span> uncovered</span></a><span> how the company has been developing ELITE, an instrument to monitor user information for the purpose of conducting ICE raids. Elsewhere, the recent, massive disclosure of Epstein emails had </span><a href="https://www.wired.com/story/epstein-files-tech-elites-gates-thiel-musk/"><span>reoccurring correspondence</span></a><span> between the world’s most active user information broker and the world’s most famous sex trafficker. The two discussed the lawsuit to <a href="https://aftermath.site/jeffrey-epstein-files-kotick-thiel-xbox-rockstar/">end</a> </span><a href="https://aftermath.site/jeffrey-epstein-files-kotick-thiel-xbox-rockstar/"><i><span>Gawker</span></i></a><span><a href="https://aftermath.site/jeffrey-epstein-files-kotick-thiel-xbox-rockstar/"> and how to best balkanize the planet</a>.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><span>Having the Founders Fund so close to expanded data-capturing across Discord, one of the more private places to have a public conversation online, </span><a href="https://piunikaweb.com/2026/02/12/discord-uk-age-verification-persona-vendor-shift/"><span>has made users a little itchy</span></a><span>. The platform has not been entirely clear about how it aims to rapidly expand its age verification process, stating a mix of mandatory scanning but also </span><a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/hardware/discord-clarifies-it-is-not-requiring-everyone-to-complete-a-face-scan-or-upload-an-id-and-will-confirm-your-age-group-using-information-we-already-have/"><span>using existing user data to guesstimate</span></a><span> if a user is in their 30s (which is great news for everyone who communicates through </span><i><span>Simpsons</span></i><span> quotes). </span></p>

 <p><a href="https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/30326565624343-How-to-Complete-Age-Assurance-on-Discord"><span>In an official update</span></a><span>, Discord suggested users who encountered prompts from Persona are part of “an experiment” and that the information will only be stored for seven days. How the tech will be used in the long term is yet to be known. When asked for comment, Discord told <em>Kotaku</em> its work with Persona was part of a “limited test” which has since been concluded.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>Regardless, I will see you on the forums.</span></p>

              <p><span>The glory days of gross-out video game PR stunts are long behind us, sadly. If and when we do get a </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/resident-evil-5-re5-remake-capcom-xbox-series-2000667258"><i><span>Resident Evil 6</span></i><span> remake</span></a><span>, it’s unlikely Capcom will serve it with a side of </span><a href="https://www.cnet.com/tech/gaming/the-resident-evil-human-meat-butchery/"><span>human-flavored sausages</span></a><span>. PlayStation doesn’t even hold ocean-hopping destination press events anymore, never mind ones where they can </span><a href="https://www.informationweek.com/software-services/sony-apologizes-for-decapitated-goat-in-god-of-war-launch"><span>sacrifice a live animal</span></a><span> for tech bloggers. Though our greatest retches are in the rearview, the PR machine can still churn out some nasties here and there. The biggest surprise is when they prove to be all practical.</span></p> <p><a href="https://aftermath.site/diablo-iv-blood-pc-contest-interview/"><span>Over at </span><i><span>Aftermath</span></i></a><span>, journalist Nathan Grayson has been bothered by a blood-fueled gaming PC, which apparently uses real-deal human plasma for liquid coolant, ever since Blizzard gave it away to <a href="https://kotaku.com/diablo-4-open-beta-review-rpg-rogue-build-barbarian-1850244422">promote </a></span><i><span>Diablo IV</span></i><span> in 2023. Grayson tried to shake down PR reps and hardware experts hoping to uncover how much blood was in there, whose blood it was, and whether such an unholy contraption is at all practical. No dice.</span></p>

 <p><span>However, Grayson did succeed in tracking down the original winner of this infernal machine, a streamer by the name of </span><a href="https://www.twitch.tv/storms888"><span>Storms888</span></a><span>. While it didn’t solve the gross mysteries that got under his skin, Grayson did learn something just as shocking: the damn thing still works. Two years later the rig continues pumping its blood.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>“I haven’t seen any drops in performance since the day I got it,” Storms888 tells Grayson. “Did leak a ton though.”&nbsp;</span></p>   <p><span>The streamer says that he believes the liquid coolant to be a cocktail of human blood and more conventional ingredients. But there is some amount of blood. Blizzard sent him replacement vials and documentational slips confirming the red stuff came from human donors. Storms888 said it’s an incredible rig for his purposes, which include livestreaming “</span><i><span>Battlefield 6</span></i><span> at ultra settings.” And with RAM prices through the roof, who can blame him for not upgrading.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><span>This is hardly the first time the deep red stuff has been used in a promotional stunt, nor the first time it was batched to accomplish it. In 1977, Marvel Comics mixed their ink with blood donated from each member of KISS for their funny book debut. Lil Nas X did something similar, drawing blood for </span><a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/kiss-used-band-members-blood-in-marvel-comic-book-2021-3"><span>a custom pair of Nikes</span></a><span> to promote 2021’s </span><i><span>Montero</span></i><span>. Blood, it turns out, is in you to give. </span><span><br> </span><span><br> </span><span>If Blizzard, Activision or Microsoft were to pull this stunt again, or cram any other body parts into giveaway hardware, it wouldn’t even make </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/microsoft-ai-slop-satya-nadella-2000656473"><span>the list of the most</span></a> <a href="https://kotaku.com/jeffrey-epstein-files-bobby-kotick-activision-ghislaine-maxwell-2000665456"><span>nauseating things</span></a> <a href="https://kotaku.com/no-games-for-genocide-xbox-microsoft-boycott-palestine-2000650175"><span>to come out of them</span></a><span> in recent history.</span></p>

 <p><span>Storms888 remains chuffed by his useful, practical, even, gross-out gift.
