In <em>Civil War</em>, its passage divided superhero leaders Captain America (Chris Evans) and Iron Man (Robert Downey Jr) over whether superheroes should sign it or not, forcing others like Black Panther and Spider-Man to choose opposing sides. These differences come to a head during an intense all-out brawl among some of Marvel’s fiercest fighters at the Leipzig/Halle Airport in Germany.</p><p>In <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/your-friendly-neighborhood-spider-man-marvel-venom-1851747418&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/your-friendly-neighborhood-spider-man-marvel-venom-1851747418"><em>Your Friendly Neighborhood Spider-Man</em></a></span>, Parker is not part of that fight, and instead finds out about it from a news report. Osborn tells Parker he’s his “own hero” when the young web slinger asks if the Avengers will patch it up, implying the fractured group’s reunion still hasn’t happened yet. In <em>Civil War</em>, Spider-Man’s involvement sets the foundation for this relationship with his mentor Tony Stark, who uncovers Parker’s identity as Spider-Man and gives him an upgraded Spider-Man suit in exchange for joining his team against Captain America. </p><p><em>Your Friendly Neighborhood Spider-Man</em> acts as a sort of parallel universe in which Osborn takes the place of Stark, uncovering Parker’s identity in the series’ third episode and offering him a suit upgrade in the fourth. I doubt Marvel would ever make a series named <em>Your Friendly Neighborhood Spider-Man </em>and turns its lovable character into a villain. But, Parker’s relationship with Stark in <em>Civil War </em>was a catalyst for him joining the Avengers and following in his mentor’s footsteps. Given Osborn’s storied history as a nefarious character known as the Green Goblin, his partnership with Parker will, at least, delay Spider-Man’s entry into the Avengers, and, at worst, make him their enemy. </p><p>Another wrinkle in <em>Your Friendly Neighborhood Spider-Man</em> is that Parker’s fandom is reserved for Captain America, not Iron Man, which could be a foreshadowing of issues to come. In the series’ fourth episode, Osborn lays out his plan for Parker to represent the next generation of superheroes after the Avengers’ destructive involvement in the events of the first two <em>Avengers</em> films left parts of the world decimated without any superhero accountability. In this alternate reality, <em>Civil War</em> didn’t introduce Spider-Man to the MCU; instead, he’s being led on an uncharted path that potentially results in him being the leader of the world’s next era of protectors. Or, maybe it leads him to disappointing Osborn, driving him to madness, and eventually ending with the inventor dead. </p><p>Either way, we’ll be tuned in for the next few Wednesdays to find out. </p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

This was apparently around half of what EA was projecting, but given the game was in development hell for a decade and was a sequel to a game that came out before millions of potential players had fully developed frontal lobes, it wasn’t too surprising. Wilson, however, is convinced the reason the long-awaited RPG sold fewer copies than the company wanted is that it wasn’t live-servicey enough. That’s not the sentiment BioWare fans want to hear with the development of <em>Mass Effect 5</em> still on the horizon.</p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="196742" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="What Is Dragonsplague?

Multiple shifts in direction weighed down <em>The Veilguard</em>’s 10-year-long development cycle. One iteration was an online multiplayer game with repeatable levels and all the live-service stuff nobody asked for in a BioWare game, but the studio made a complete pivot after the <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/how-biowares-anthem-went-wrong-1833731964&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/how-biowares-anthem-went-wrong-1833731964">critical and commercial failure of <em>Anthem</em></a></span>, the RPG studio’s looter shooter detour that <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/anthem-bioware-5-years-later-1851294156&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/anthem-bioware-5-years-later-1851294156">became a cautionary tale</a></span> for how forcing live-service features into studios not built to make those games will only ever have diminishing returns.</p><p>There’s an odd dissonance in Wilson saying <em>The Veilguard</em>’s problem is that it didn’t appeal to people looking for another forever game to add to the growing list of competing live-service titles on the market.

So it’s not surprising that Wilson would attribute <em>The Veilguard</em>’s underperforming to something EA can only contextualize in its own catalog. <em>Baldur’s Gate 3 </em>might as well not have happened if EA didn’t make it.</p><p>All of this has me worried about what it could mean for <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/mass-effect-4-5-bioware-teaser-release-date-2029-1851009417&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/mass-effect-4-5-bioware-teaser-release-date-2029-1851009417"><em>Mass Effect 5</em></a></span>. The writing is on the wall now that BioWare has one more chance to right the ship, and since moderate successes aren’t enough anymore, it has to be a cultural moment on the scale of the original sci-fi trilogy. Hearing that Wilson thinks the key to success is repeating proven mistakes should scare any <em>Mass Effect </em>fan.
