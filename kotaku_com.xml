              <p>Carrying multiple chargers for your phone, laptop and tablet turns any bag into a tangled mess of cables and bulky adapters. The good news is that <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6487/">Anker’s Prime 67W charger just dropped to $37 on Amazon, slicing $12 off its $49 list price to hit an all-time low right before Christmas</a>. This <strong>three-port GaN charger</strong> replaces at least two or three separate adapters you’re probably lugging around right now, saving both money and precious bag space. Compared to buying three individual chargers that would easily cost $60 to $80 combined, this deal makes financial sense even before you factor in the convenience upgrade.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6487/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Why the size of charging bricks really does matter</h2>
<p>GaN technology makes this charger <strong>51% smaller than Apple’s original 67W MacBook adapter</strong> which means it fits in your pocket or bag without making a bulge. Silicon-based chargers make more heat and need bigger parts to safely handle high wattage. Gallium nitride, on the other hand, runs cooler and more efficiently in a smaller space. When you pack for a trip or commute, you’ll notice right away that this small brick takes up about the same amount of space as older 30W chargers, but it provides more than twice as much power. The <strong>foldable prongs</strong> make it even easier to carry around because they don’t get caught on things like fixed-prong adapters do.</p>



<p>You can charge three devices at once from one wall outlet <strong>with the two USB-C ports and one USB-A port</strong>: This changes how you manage your devices in coffee shops, airports, and hotel rooms. You can charge your phone and connect your older wireless earbud case to your MacBook Pro through USB-C. All of these devices get power from a single small adapter. The charger gives out the full 67W when you connect just one device and it is enough to charge a 14-inch MacBook Pro from dead to 50% in about 30 minutes.</p>



<p>When you use both USB-C ports together or one USB-C port with the USB-A port, <strong>the dual-port charging can only give you 65W of power</strong>. This is still enough power for most real-world situations. You can charge a laptop at 45W and a phone at 20W at the same time, or you can split the power more evenly between the devices you’ve plugged in. The charger automatically negotiates power delivery based on what each device needs, so you don’t have to worry about which port does what or damaging your devices with the wrong voltages.</p>
<p>Anker’s ActiveShield 2.0 <strong>checks the temperature more than 3 million times a day</strong> and changes the power output to keep your devices from overheating or having electrical problems that could damage them. This protection system runs all the time in the background, checking voltage, current, and temperature thousands of times per second to find problems before they happen. You won’t even know it’s working, which is the point, because good safety features work without the user having to do anything.</p>
<p><strong>Anker backs the Prime 67W with a 24-month warranty</strong> that covers defects and failures which means that if something goes wrong, you can actually get your money back instead of just paying for it. That warranty period is longer than what most of their competitors offer, which shows that the company thinks these chargers will last instead of being thrown away.</p>
<p>This is the math that counts: A three-port 67W charger for $37 is a lot better than buying separate adapters, and it makes your charging setup more organized by putting everything in one piece of hardware. A single-port 65W charger usually costs $30 to $40 on its own, and adding two more chargers for other devices would make the total cost well over $60. That $12 discount may not seem like much, but when you think about how much money you’ll save by not having to buy multiple chargers, this deal is a smart way to spend your money instead of an impulse buy.</p>

              <p>Back in November last year, <a href="https://kotaku.com/horizon-zero-dawn-sony-light-of-motiram-tencent-copy-1851709969">Tencent revealed a game called&nbsp;</a><em><a href="https://kotaku.com/horizon-zero-dawn-sony-light-of-motiram-tencent-copy-1851709969">Light of Motiram</a>&nbsp;</em>that was almost comically obviously lifting its entire aesthetic from Sony’s&nbsp;<em>Horizon</em> game series. At the time we suggested the game was obviously a lawsuit waiting to happen, and sure enough in July this year <a href="https://kotaku.com/horizon-zero-dawn-sony-light-of-motiram-tencent-copy-1851709969">Sony announced it was suing Tencent</a> over the “slavish clone.” Now, it appears that case has been quietly settled behind the scenes.</p> <p>As reported by&nbsp;<a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/847080/sony-tencent-lawsuit-horizon-clone-light-of-motiram-settlement"><em>The Verge</em></a>, a <a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/26381827-sony-v-tencent-stipulation-for-dismissal-pursuant-to-rule-41a1aii/">court document</a> reveals that the case is over, all parties are paying their own costs, and—as so often seems to be the case—the settlement is “confidential.” Which is to say, we’ll never find out what was agreed, but can draw inference from the fact that the game’s Steam page remains deleted.</p>

 <p>At the time of the reveal,&nbsp;<em>Light of Motiram</em> was hilariously obviously knocking off&nbsp;<em>Horizon Zero Dawn</em>. Every detail of the promo shots could be mistaken for a new entry in Guerrilla Games’ series, from setting to player character to robo-animal creature design. Sony claimed in its lawsuit that the company had recently declined to collaborate with Tencent on a new&nbsp;<em>Horizon</em> game, and soon after Tencent revealed their remarkably familiar game anyway.</p>

 <figure id="attachment_2000654566" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000654566"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000654566">© Tencent</figcaption></figure> <p>The creature designs were especially egregious, making&nbsp;<em>Palworld</em> look like a font of creativity:</p> <figure id="attachment_2000654567" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000654567"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000654567">© Tencent / Sony / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p>A month after Sony filed, <a href="https://kotaku.com/horizon-zero-dawn-tencent-sony-lawsuit-knockoff-steam-art-2000616608">Tencent removed the store pages for <i>Motiram</i></a> from both Steam and the Epic Game Store, which didn’t look wholly innocent. Developers Polaris Quest also had previously started removing the most overt images and language, trying to portray a far more generic-looking game. This was thought at the time to perhaps be an effort to convince Sony to settle, but perhaps was laying the groundwork for <a href="https://kotaku.com/light-of-motiram-horizon-lawsuit-sony-tencent-monopoly-2000626858">Tencent’s attempt to have the case dismissed</a> on the basis that Sony couldn’t claim a “monopoly on genre conventions” from a “well-trodden corner of popular culture.”</p>

 <p>Jump forward to today, and it seems the two companies have agreed to stop fighting and play in their own sections of the yard. In a statement provided to&nbsp;<em>The Verge</em>, Tencent said “SIE and Tencent are pleased to have reached a confidential resolution and will have no further public comment on this matter.”</p> <p>What this all means will perhaps become more clear if <em>Light of Motiram</em> restores its store pages or resumes updates. Its <a href="https://lightofmotiram.com/EN/index.html#index">website</a> still has links to the long-deleted Steam store page, but its various social media accounts and Discord haven’t been updated since March, notably months before Sony filed the suit.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/dji-is-unloading-more-than-drones-as-the-osmo-pocket-3-vlogging-camera-hits-a-record-low-2000654332</link>

              <p>For better or worse, it seems like everybody’s got a vlog now. And, to put it politely, most of them aren’t exactly known for their production value. That’s an opportunity for you if you’re considering jumping into the vlogging universe, because content that shows up in Instagram Reels or TikTok or YouTube with a clear and steady picture and crisp sound is going to get and keep far more eyeballs than one that looks like it was shot with a camcorder from the ’90s.</p>
<p>The best way to make those professional-looking and sounding videos for posting online or just sharing with friends and family is to <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6481/">grab this Amazon deal on the DJI Osmo Pocket 3 while it’s still at a very healthy 35% off.</a> The new $518 price is a steep drop of nearly $300, and it’s a total steal for a 4K video camera as compact, powerful, and easy to use as the Osmo Pocket 3.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6481/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Smartphones Can’t Compete</h2>
<p>Even the newest and best smartphones from Samsung or Apple which are rightfully proud of their camera and microphone quality can’t hang with the DJI Osmo Pocket 3. The smartphones are multitasking marvels, but all of the tech muscle of the the Osmo Pocket 3 is devoted to creating the best videos possible, achieving 4K resolution at an awesome 120 frames per second while staying absolutely rock-solid steady and perfectly framed.</p>
<p>That stability should come as no surprise to anyone familiar with the DJI brand, which made its initial big splash with its fleet of drones that shoot amazing video while flying at top speed. Those drone cameras are held steady by mechanical gimbals that automatically compensate for motion by moving the camera, and the Osmo Pocket 3 has the most updated version of that tech, with 3-axis gimbal mechanical stabilization that eliminate the shaky effect most handheld cameras produce.</p>



<h2>Always Ready</h2>
<p>The real draw of the DJI Osmo Pocket 3 is its size, or distinct lack thereof. It’s literally pocket-sized and exceptionally lightweight, so it’s easy to control with just one hand. The 2-inch video screen rotates for vertical and horizontal shooting, and with the superior stabilization, you can shoot action while you’re on the move and it will come out steady and shake-free — including high quality slo-mo. That includes livestreaming, which the Osmo Pocket 3 can do effortlessly on YouTube and RTMP platforms. DJI’s ActiveTrack 6.0 and Dynamic Framing features will keep you or whatever else you’re capturing firmly centered for the best quality.</p>
<p>You can jump to the head of the vlogging class quickly when you’re shooting with the DJI Osmo Pocket 3. If you’re not looking for the spotlight and just looking for an outstanding video camera to capture the great family moments, the Osmo Pocket 3 will create the best-quality home movies yet. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6481/">At 35% off, Amazon’s deal offering the DJI Osmo Pocket 3 for just $518 is a huge bargain.</a></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>We all deserve a pair of top-notch, headphones. Don’t be the person on the subway blasting TikToks at full volume. With a quality set of noise-canceling Beats Studio Pro headphones, you can enjoy watching some guy’s top five movie twists of all time in peace, without disturbing those around you. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6480/">Right now, you can save a massive 49% on a pair of Beats Studio Pros over at Amazon, with each set priced at just $180.</a></p>
<p>The Beats Studio Pro headphones support active noise cancellation, so you can filter out distracting background noises when you really want to focus in on whatever it is you’re listening to. This is great for when flying to overcome the loud noise of the plane engine as well as when just trying to ignore nearby conversations in a chatty office. Then when you do want to engage with the world once more, you can switch over to transparency mode to let outside noises come through.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6480/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>
<p>The personalized spatial audio utilizes dynamic head tracking, ensuring you are placed right in the middle of a fully immersive 360-degree listening experience. Through the USB-C connection, you’ll enjoy pristine, lossless audio, making every track sound sharper and more detailed.</p>

<p>The multi-function on-ear controls allow you to effortlessly manage your music playback, activate Siri, or take phone calls—all without fumbling through your device. The voice-targeting microphone isolates your voice with incredible precision, ensuring that the person on the other end of your call hears only you, even in noisy, crowded environments.</p>
<h2>Match Your Style</h2>
<p>With a wide selection of colors to choose from, you can find a pair that fits your personal aesthetic. The classic black is always a reliable and timeless choice, but there are other fun options if you want to switch things up. Warm, earthy tones like deep brown or sandstone can complement your winter wardrobe, while bold options like matte white offer a fresh, eye-catching look. Personally, I’m partial to the two-toned sand gray.</p>



<p>When it comes to battery life, you’re covered. You’ll get a whopping 40 hours of total listening time before needing to recharge, which is more than enough for long flights or all-day listening sessions. And if you find yourself in a situation where you forgot to charge them and need your headphones immediately, don’t worry. Just 10 minutes of Fast Fuel charging will give you 4 hours of playback time. No more stressing over a dead battery.</p>
<p>Connecting these headphones to your devices is incredibly easy, thanks to their NFC compatibility. Simply tap your phone or tablet to pair it with the Beats Studio Pro. Whether you’re using an Apple or Android device, and you will be ready to go in seconds.</p>
<p>Normally, the Beats Studio Pro Bluetooth noise-canceling headphones are priced at $350, but right now, Amazon is offering them at a steep discount. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6480/">You can grab a pair for $170 off, bringing the price down to just $180.</a> That’s an impressive 49% savings, making it the perfect time to upgrade your audio experience.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>It’s officially last-minute-panic time with just a week left to get your presents bought and wrapped, and the number of items on Amazon with the “arrives before Christmas” is dwindling, and dwindling&nbsp;<em>fast</em>. Our advice? Don’t panic, and <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6175/">take a quick look at this awesome 36% off deal on the Samsung Galaxy Tab A9+ tablet</a>. It’s one of those rare tablets that’s kid-friendly while not being a glorified toy, so it’s a stellar $140 last-minute option for friends and family from young to old.</p>
<p>This 11-inch tablet comes with a robust 7,040mAh battery for hours of games, streaming, or actual work. Split-screen capability lets you run and see multiple apps simultaneously, and the slim and lightweight construction is good for little hands while also being tough enough to endure the occasional knocks and bumps that go hand in hand with kids using tech devices.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6175/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Travel Sanity Saver</h2>
<p>There’s really not a bad time to share the Galaxy A9+ with the kids, but the time for it to truly shine is when you’re taking a trip and need something — <em>anything</em> — to maintain sanity as you’re buckled in for a long flight or drive. The Galaxy Tab A9+ isn’t one of those kids-only tablets that keeps its allure for a short while before the conversation turns to “I want to use&nbsp;<em>your</em> tablet.” Nor is it a high-priced device that you hand over very reluctantly for fear of damage. Pass it to the backseat, or hand it across the aisle of the plane, fire up the Samsung Kids app, and rest easy while they’re engrossed in only the content you deem appropriate.</p>
<p>Chances are that will include some streaming or videos, and the Galaxy A9+ brings that out in vivid fashion across its generous 11-inch screen with 1200p resolution and a brisk 90Hz refresh rate. The built-in speakers are loaded with Dolby Atmos tech for cinema-quality sound, or you can easily pair the A9+ tablet with wireless headphones or earbuds to keep the sound private. Preloading the Galaxy A9+ is easy when you have a generous 64GB of built-in storage and microSD card expansion options.</p>



<h2>Do It All for $150</h2>
<p>Once back in your hands (assuming you can actually get it back), the Galaxy A9+ is a stellar midrange tablet at an entry-level price. It’s especially good if you’re adding it to other Samsung tech products, from big-screen TVs to smart home devices, smartphones, and wireless earbuds. Casting content from the Galaxy A9+ to a Samsung smart TV is remarkably easy, and you can hand off calls and texts from a Samsung smartphone to the Galaxy Tab A9+ and take them across the house, even if you leave the phone behind.</p>
<p>Last-minute holiday shopping panic isn’t fun. But the Samsung Galaxy Tab A9+ is, for adults and kids alike. It’s also the cure for your shopping anxiety because <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6175/">Amazon’s offering it for a crazy low $140 price and they can get it to you in time to make it under the tree.</a></p>
