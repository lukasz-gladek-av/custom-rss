              <p>Big <em>Cult of the Lamb</em> DLC and even bigger PC gaming handhelds. Welcome to the latest edition of Morning Checkpoint, <em>Kotaku</em>‘s daily roundup of gaming news and culture. I am still recovering from the Philadelphia Eagles’ narrow escape from the Dallas Cowboys last night. It only took six seconds for star defensive tackle Jalen Carter to get ejected from the game for spitting at opposing quarterback Dak Prescott, only for a second angle to reveal Prescott actually spit first.</p> <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">DAK SPAT FIRST?!?! <a href="https://t.co/J2xrMlJRLj">pic.twitter.com/J2xrMlJRLj</a></p> <p>— Bussin' With The Boys (@BussinWTB) <a href="https://twitter.com/BussinWTB/status/1963806763418829238?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">September 5, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <p>Carter apparently then asked him if he just spat at him (Prescott’s loogie had little hang-time before going straight to the ground) and Prescott said something to the effect of “why the hell would I do that?” and then Carter decided the time for words had ended and fired back with his own salvo of saliva aimed squarely at Prescott’s chest. <a href="https://nypost.com/2025/09/05/sports/dak-prescott-explains-his-version-after-new-video-emerges-in-eagles-spit-gate/">The curse of <em>Madden</em> continues</a>? I can’t wait to suffer through another season of the 2024 Super Bowl champions looking like utter frauds.</p> <h2>The Legion Go 2 is almost twice as expensive as the original</h2> <p>Lenovo revealed its newest PC gaming handheld and its impressive specs are overshadowed only by its price tag. It starts at $1,100 or about the price of a 15-inch MacBook Air. For that you get an 8.8 inch OLED display, an AMD Z2 processor, 16GB of RAM, and 1TB of storage. <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/769776/legion-go-2-official-lenovo-new-flagship-handheld-cost"><em>The Verge</em> reports</a> it won’t launch with SteamOS, and it won’t have Microsoft’s new Windows gaming UI that’s <a href="https://kotaku.com/rog-xbox-ally-price-pc-gaming-handheld-asus-pre-order-2000622751">releasing with the Xbox ROG Ally</a> either. None of this is doing much for my enthusiasm for an otherwise cool upgrade.</p>

 <p>It’ll be the beefiest portable PC gaming competitor to the Switch 2 when it arrives on October 31, complete with detachable controller grips, a kickstand, and optical mouse controls. But with the best Legion Go 2 model coming in at almost $1,500, I’m not sure any number of new bells and whistles will get prospective buyers over the sticker shock.</p> <h2><em>Cult of the Lamb</em>‘s <em>Woolhaven</em> DLC will be almost as long as the base game</h2>   <p>The action roguelike base-builder has an expansion coming in early 2026 and developer Massive Monster claims it will <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@cultofthelamb/video/7546404300310859026?_t=ZN-8zTCaEzxTMM&amp;_r=1">effectively feel like a second game</a>. The wintery DLC adds new settlement mechanics, levels to explore, and brutal weather to survive. It looks neat but unlike all of the free updates generously showered on players, <em>Woodhaven</em> will be paid. No price has been revealed yet.</p>

 <p>“We tend to go all out, be at weddings, to raves, to three free massive content updates,” the devs said in a TikTok. “This DLC is not free, but I promise you’ll love it.”</p> <h2><em>Schedule 1</em> fans are voting on whether to finally bring shrooms to the hit Steam game</h2> <p>The drug-selling <a href="https://newsletter.gamediscover.co/p/schedule-is-solo-smash-hit-and-the">crewlike</a>‘s <em>Rival Cartels</em> update is live and the next <a href="http://Hireable Drivers, Fishing, and Shrooms.">community poll</a> is available for players to vote on. The three options are between Hireable Drivers, Fishing, and Shrooms, a psychedelic not currently available in the game. While drivers would be the most practical, fans of funky fungi have been waiting for their moment in the spotlight. Some players are chanting “Shrooms, baby!” Others say “Fishing EZ.” The weirdos howl “I want police raids so bad.”</p>

 <h2><em>MindsEye</em> devs surprise remaining players by actually continuing to fix the game</h2> <p>“I can’t wait for the next statement from the studio (it’s so fucking over),” wrote Electrical_Sugar_742 a <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/MindsEye/comments/1n73bx6/i_cant_wait_for_the_next_statement_from_the/">couple of days ago</a>. But Build A Rocket Boy responded with <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/MindsEyeGame/comments/1n90pgy/update_4_pc_console/">update 4,</a> which is full of changes to the beleaguered action shooter. It addresses PC performance issues and adds quality-of-life improvements, including the ability to finally skip cutscenes. How are players responding?</p> <p>“I’ve deleted it for now,” wrote one. “Maybe by 2040 the game will reach 1.0,” wrote another. The most controversial patch note is “Removed EVERYWHERE vehicles from Build.MindsEye – those vehicles were made accessible unofficially, and we will bring them to MindsEye when they are ready.” User RazorLined wrote, “You guys really thought this was the time to make that change. Really guys. REALLY!?!” Tough crowd.</p>

 <h2>Repair support for every old Nintendo console before the Switch has officially ended</h2> <p>The <em>Mario</em> maker ran out of replacement parts for the New 2DS XL this week. “Due to the depletion of parts inventory required for repairs, we have terminated the repair service for the New Nintendo 2DS XL console as of September 4, 2025,” a&nbsp; <a href="https://x.com/nintendo_cs/status/1838479151034175962">post on X</a> reads, per X’s built-in translate function. “Repair services for all other Nintendo 3DS series have also been terminated.”</p> <p>The company ended <a href="https://x.com/nintendo_cs/status/1808707230377914724">repair support</a> for the Wii U last year. With both platforms’ eShops also set down and no online functionality left, the sun has finally set on Nintendo’s pre-Switch years.</p> <h2>ICYMI:</h2> <ul> <li><a href="https://kotaku.com/firaxis-lays-off-dozens-devs-civilization-vii-struggles-cuts-2k-2000623187"><em>Civ 7</em> studio Firaxis is laying off a bunch of developers as the game struggles</a></li> <li><a href="https://kotaku.com/puzzle-quest-immortal-edition-match-3-remaster-2000623170">Another one of the best puzzle games ever is getting a remaster</a></li> <li><a href="https://kotaku.com/gta-6-aaaaa-silksong-next-gen-pc-devolver-digital-2000623190">GTA 6 will only truly be an “AAAAA” level blockbuster if it can save console gaming</a></li> </ul> <h2>Watch this:</h2>

              <p>Pokémon Poke-nade Monster Ball may sound like the world’s weirdest energy drink crossover, but it is in fact the translated name for Pokémon’s latest venture, a Tamagotchi-style interactive keychain pet, albeit far more complex than the Tamagotchis of old. Which of course raises two all-important questions: Can you let the Pokémon starve to death? And will it poop?</p> <p>This&nbsp;<em>isn’t</em> a Pokémon x Tamagotchi situation, it should be said. That has happened before, as a matter of fact: an official crossover with Bandai Namco’s pocket toys happened in 2019, with the retro devices selling out day one on the Pokémon Center. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S1p92K06svQ">YouTuber UnlistedLeaf</a> once found himself trapped caring for a teeny pixel Eevee that incessantly demanded food, but instead of pooping would cough up furballs. And no, that one didn’t die if you failed to look after it, but instead ran away. Which is kind of horrifying in its own right.</p>  <p>This new venture (<a href="https://essential-japan.com/news/pokemon-is-getting-its-own-official-tamagotchi-style-virtual-pet/">spotted by <em>Essential Japan</em></a>), which is with Bandai rival Takara Tomy looks like a much more advanced toy. First of all, it’s in color, but also encased in a Poké ball shell, with a touch-sensitive screen. The latter is because a part of looking after your pocket-sized pocket monster is stroking it (that’s the “Poke-nade” part of the name, which is a portmanteau of Pokémon and “naderu,” to stroke).</p>

 <p>Apparently, poking at the screen will get the Pokémon to react in various cutesy ways. According to&nbsp;<em>Essential Japan</em>, “the Pokémon will react differently depending on the length and speed of the petting,” and you are fully able to make your own revolting jokes right here.</p> <p>The Monster Ball sounds pretty impressively in-depth compared to the Tamagotchi, which could only eat, sick up fur, and eventually evolve. This new toy will let you play with the Pokémon, and even take part in Pokémon battles. There’s also a diary feature that’ll remember all your previous interactions, and the device will apparently offer 157 different Pokémon to choose from. Some of them—Pikachu, Eevee, Sprigatito, Fuecoco, Quaxly, Lucario and Sylveon—will even be voiced and come with more detailed animations.</p>

 <figure id="attachment_2000623448" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000623448"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000623448">© The Pokémon Company</figcaption></figure> <p>That inclusion of Sylveon on the list does suggest one peculiar aspect, however. If you can start with an Eevee or a Sylveon, it does indicate that the monsters might not be able to evolve. An odd choice if true, especially given the Paldean starter Pokémon included get far more entertaining as they grow.</p> <p>It looks like these will be a Japan-only release for now, but despite featuring a touch screen and far more complexity than a Tamagotchi, they’re surprisingly cheap. ¥7,480, which works out to just over $50. However, I’m absolutely certain they’ll sell out almost instantly, and go for far higher resale prices to the rest of the world.</p> <p>But can they die?! Do they poop?! We <em>don’t know</em>. It seems incredibly unlikely, given The Pokémon Company overrode the usual rules for Tamagotchi when it partnered with them, but it’ll be interesting to learn how the game responds to a bad owner. Or a messy one.</p>
