While that made it sound like <em>No Rest for the Wicked</em> could skip Microsoft’s platform entirely, he was quick to foll0w up clarifying that the grimdark fantasy adventure will hit Xbox eventually.</p><p>“There’s nothing to officially confirm yet,” he <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://x.com/thomasmahler/status/1947340601781051493&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://x.com/thomasmahler/status/1947340601781051493" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">added on X</a></span>. “We want to support consoles and just looking at the numbers, PS5 makes the most sense at the moment.  Ultimately we’ll ship on all platforms, but likely not at the same time!”</p><p>With PS5 currently sitting at around 80 million consoles sold, the Xbox Series X/S, whose hardware revenue within Microsoft falls precipitously every year, is estimated to have sold less than half that. The Switch 2 only just launched, but is already breaking launch records and is expected to continue the momentum of its 155-million-unit-selling predecessor. So if you’re a small team allocating limited resources for porting your PC release, the case for prioritizing Xbox is becoming harder and harder to make. </p><p>The problem’s been pronounced enough that Microsoft published a developer blog post last fall <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/games-skipping-xbox-microsoft-asks-devs-studio-why-ps5-1851663611&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/games-skipping-xbox-microsoft-asks-devs-studio-why-ps5-1851663611">asking studios for feedback</a></span>. “If you are making video games, we’re interested in hearing from you,” it <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/games/articles/2024/09/how-xbox-research-is-shaping-the-future-of-game-development/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/games/articles/2024/09/how-xbox-research-is-shaping-the-future-of-game-development/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">read</a></span>. “If you aren’t on Xbox, we’d love to know why. And honestly, if you are using our competitor’s products, you probably have a great perspective we could learn from!”</p><p>The case of <em>No Rest for the Wicked</em> is especially striking, though, given the size of the team (estimated at over 80 people) and Moon Studios’ history with Xbox. <em>Ori and the Blind Forest </em>was a 2015 exclusive that proved to be a bright spot for the Xbox One as it recovered from its rough launch. The follow-up, <em>Ori and the Will of the Wisps</em>, did the same for the Xbox Series X/S. While both games have since been ported to Switch, neither was ever made available on PlayStation. </p><p><em>No Rest for the Wicked</em>, which swaps snappy 2D platforming for weighty top-down dungeon crawling, will now reverse that trend. I guess there’s no Game Pass deal on the table this time around. <br></p><p>.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://kotaku.com/ori-no-rest-wicked-console-port-souls-rpg-xbox-ps5-1851786659]]></content:encoded>

Coldplay frontman Chris Martin remarked that the couple was either “having an affair or they’re just very shy,” but the internet did what it does best and found out who they were, and the entire thing has played out very publicly and invasively. And now that the footage has been seen by millions, it’s being parodied at sporting events that have a kiss cam.</p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="197589" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="Ring Psychology: Understanding The 6 Phases Of A Wrestling Match Through Heel Era John Cena" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="659" data-playlist="197589,197586,197585" data-current="197589"><div><p>Ring Psychology: Understanding The 6 Phases Of A Wrestling Match Through Heel Era John Cena</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197589/197589_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197589/197589_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197589/197589_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/23110.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>Footage from several sporting events has been showing up online in the days since the Coldplay show, with some venues rebranding their kiss cam as the “Coldplay Cam.” Normally, these crowd shots displayed on a huge screen give couples a chance to express their love for one another for all to see. Sometimes, there are awkward misunderstandings where the folks behind the camera capture siblings or friends, and they have to flail about so everyone knows they’re not a couple. But right now, all anyone seems to want to do is run away from the camera to reference the now-infamous scene. Some venues are even encouraging it, searching for couples who are embracing the same way the caught couple was at Coldplay’s show. One of the funnier examples was when the Phillie Phanatics’ mascots unexpectedly re-enacted the whole thing shot for shot.</p><p>The whole situation has split the internet.

That follows several other updates that brought improved AI, UI, and quality-of-life fixes to the game, including a revamped hunter’s guide to make the open-world game’s grind less cumbersome. The result is one of the best-looking next-gen games ever, with some pretty cool moments buried in-between the familiar Ubisoft game design bloat. </p><p><em>Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora </em>also has an enhanced mode for PS5 Pro and is regularly on sale for dirt cheap. The Deluxe Edition is currently just $24 on PSN (it’s normally $80) and BJ’s is currently selling the Xbox version for just $10. Suffice it to say, it’s routinely in that sweet spot of “worth checking out for the price,” especially if you’re a <em>Far Cry</em> fan who likes hunting and taking out enemy forts using a combination of stealth and pure chaos. </p><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/far-cry-7-assassins-creed-hexe-ghost-recon-delay-1851780674&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/far-cry-7-assassins-creed-hexe-ghost-recon-delay-1851780674">A new <em>Far Cry</em></a></span><em> i</em>s likely still a year or more away, with Ubisoft recently confirming that some of its biggest in-development blockbusters would be delayed to get the time they needed.
