              <p>Wizards of the Coast is going to turn as much <a href="https://kotaku.com/final-fantasy-mtg-magic-gathering-vivi-stock-1851786817">paper into gold</a> as it can with <em>Magic: The Gathering</em>, and leading the way is its best-selling <em>Final Fantasy</em> Universes Beyond set. The company recently <a href="https://kotaku.com/magic-gathering-mtg-star-trek-marvel-avengers-2026-sets-2000629313">announced at MagicCon Atlanta 2025</a> that it will be releasing additional <em>Final Fantasy</em> box sets with new cards featuring more beautiful art spanning the Square Enix RPG franchise’s history. If you’re worried about your wallet, relax! The initial wave of pre-orders sold out instantly.</p> <p>This mini-expansion includes a new <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ffxiv/comments/1nr9lnn/new_magic_the_gathering_cards_revealed_today/">Chocobo Bundle</a>, a new Commander Deck, and four new Scene Boxes. They all arrive on December 5 and all of them are basically impossible to find online right now. Hopefully, fans have better luck with the inventory that comes directly to their local hobby shops. The Chocobo Bundle is $110 and comes with a bunch of booster packs, Chocobo-themed lands, alt-art reprints, a new promo card, and an incredibly neat life total click-wheel:</p>

   <p>Then there’s the new $100<em> FFVII</em> Limit Break Commander Deck that comes with a PC download code for the HD remaster of the original game and an exclusive Traditional Foil promo card that shows Cloud looking up at Shinra HQ. It seems way over-priced but is also completely sold out right now on Amazon.</p>

 <p>The new Scene Boxes are what really have my attention. There’s one each for <em>Final Fantasy</em>,<em> Final Fantasy VIII</em>,<em> Final Fantasy IX</em>, and<em> Final Fantasy XV</em>. Each comes with six Foil Borderless Scene Cards, six Art Cards, three Play Boosters, and one Display Easel for $42. The six cards go together to recreate scenes from each game. These new cards aren’t legal in standard play but look cool as heck. The art on the boxes alone makes me want one.</p>

   <p>There was no shortage of <em>Lord of the Rings</em> Scene Boxes when they arrived in 2023, offering hope that after the initial frenzy subsides, fans will be able to get access to the new<em> Final Fantasy</em> ones without too much trouble, and without paying over MSRP for them. Are the boxes worth even that? In the grand scheme of things, probably not. But that’s the whole point of Universes Beyond: subverting logic with passion.</p> <p>The result has been very lucrative for Wizards but a pain for many fans. “This whole collab has been so confusing,” <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ffxiv/comments/1nr9lnn/new_magic_the_gathering_cards_revealed_today/">wrote</a> one after the latest <em>Final Fantasy</em> products were announced. “Every attempt I’ve made at actually purchasing cards has shown that the set is sold out everywhere, and they don’t seem to be printing any new ones. But there’s new cards still coming out too?” Yes. And I suspect these won’t be the last ones either.</p>

              <p>Amazon’s Prime Day sales event starts next week on October 7. But the online retailer has already marked down a ton of products ahead of its made-up holiday, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/goldbox?tag=kotaku01-20">including a long list of 4K UHD Blu-ray movies</a>. As streaming becomes more expensive and content is split up across more platforms and hidden behind more paywalls, owning a movie on Blu-ray is the best way to ensure you can watch it anytime you want at no extra cost. And, assuming you have the proper cables and setup, with 4K UHD Blu-rays, you get a picture quality that is better than compressed streaming content, too!</p> <p>Remember, you’ll need a UHD player to watch any of these movies. Your PS5 and Xbox Series X are solid UHD players, assuming they have disc slots and you are using the correct HDMI cable.</p> <p>With that all out of the way, here are the UHD movies currently on sale on Amazon. Heads up that in the past, popular movies have sometimes sold out during these big UHD sales, so if something catches your eye, don’t wait too long to snag it. And if you’re looking for spooky movies ahead of Halloween, I’ve included plenty on the list below.</p> <hr> <ul> <li><em>A Quiet Place</em> -$15 ($35)</li> <li>A Quiet Place Part II – $15 ($26)</li> <li><em>Air Force One</em> – $15 ($27)</li> <li><em>Batman Begins</em> – $15 ($35)</li> <li><em>The Dark Knight</em> – $14 ($35)</li> <li><em>The Dark Knight Rises</em> – $13 ($35)</li> <li><em>Batman Returns</em> – $15 ($35)</li> <li><em>Batman Forever</em> – $13 ($25)</li> <li><em>Batman &amp; Robin</em> – $12 ($25)</li> <li><em>Clueless</em> – $14 ($26)</li> <li><em>Cloverfield</em> – $15 ($26)</li> <li><em>10 Cloverfield Lane</em> – $15 ($26)</li> <li><em>Dredd</em> – $13 ($23)</li> <li><em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons: Honor Among Thieves</em> – $15 ($34)</li> <li><em>E.T.: The Extra-Terrestrial</em> – $14 ($30)</li> <li><em>Evil Dead Rise</em> – $14 ($17)</li> <li><em>Ferris Bueller’s Day Off</em> – $15 ($26)</li> <li><em>Friday the 13th</em> – $15 ($26)</li> <li><em>Get Out</em> – $14 ($23)</li> <li><em>Gladiator II</em> – $15 ($30)</li> <li><em>Indiana Jones: Raiders of the Lost Ark</em> – $15 ($26)</li> <li><em>Inglorious Basterds</em> – $12 ($25)</li> <li><em>Mother!</em> – $11 ($24)</li> <li><em>Poltergeist</em> – $13.72 ($34)</li> <li><em>Reservoir Dogs</em> – $11 ($13)</li> <li><em>Saturday Night Fever</em> – $15 ($26)</li> <li><em>Split</em> – $14 ($23)</li> <li><em>Star Trek: The Motion Picture: Director’s Cut</em> – $15 ($26)</li> <li><em>Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan</em> – $15 ($26)</li> <li><em>Star Trek IV: The Voyage Home –</em> $15 ($26)</li> <li><em>Star Trek V: The Final Frontier</em> – $15 ($26)</li> <li><em>Star Trek VI: The Undiscovered Country</em> – $15 ($26)</li> <li><em>Star Trek First Contact</em> – $15 ($26)</li> <li><em>Star Trek Insurrection</em> – $15 ($26)</li> <li><em>Star Trek Nemesis</em>— $15 ($26)</li> <li><em>Star Trek Into Darkness</em> – $15 ($23)</li> <li><em>The Thing</em> – $12 ($30)</li> <li><em>Titanic</em> – $15 ($26)</li> <li><em>TMNT: Mutant Mayhem</em> – $15 ($38)</li> <li><em>Top Gun</em> – $15 ($26)</li> <li><em>Top Gun: Maverick</em> – $15 ($26)</li> <li><em>Transformers One</em> – $15 ($36)</li> <li><em>Transformers Bumblebee</em> – $15 ($26)</li> <li><em>The Untouchables</em> – $15 ($26)</li> <li><em>Us</em> – $13 ($23)</li> <li><em>Van Helsing</em> – $10 ($23)</li> <li><em>Wayne’s World</em> – $11 ($26)</li> </ul>
