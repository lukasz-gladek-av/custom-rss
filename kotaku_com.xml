              <p>Matt Ryan, the actor behind <a href="https://kotaku.com/lets-rank-the-assassins-creed-games-worst-to-best-1844019813?_gl=1*5o1ks5*_ga*NzE0NzM5NTc5LjE3Mjk4Njg5MzU.*_ga_V4QNJTT5L0*MTc0MjMwOTA2MS4yNDkuMS4xNzQyMzEwMDQyLjYwLjAuMA.."><em>Assassin’s Creed: Black Flag</em>’s</a> main character Edward Kenway, recently told a fan that they <a href="https://kotaku.com/assassins-creed-4-black-flag-voice-actor-teases-remake-1851785327">might have a reason to replay the 2013 pirate game</a>. The <em>Constantine </em>actor said this at a convention signing, and fans took this as a tease of a <a href="https://kotaku.com/assassin-s-creed-4-black-flag-remake-skull-bones-1850596271">potential remake or remaster</a>. However, it sounds like Ryan wasn’t in the clear to even say this much to a fan, as Ubisoft apparently threatened legal action against him after video of the interaction spread online.</p> <p>TikTok user kylo_hd659 posted a video of them meeting with Ryan at Comic Con Manchester at his signing table. When the topic of the <em>Black Flag </em>remaster came up, Ryan explained that he didn’t realize the previous interaction was being recorded, and now that it’s put him in hot water with Ubisoft, he’s keeping his mouth shut on the matter.</p> <p>“The thing is, when that happened, someone was doing this and I was being very free and open and I didn’t know that they were actually recording me on their phone,” Ryan said. “Then the company threatened to sue me. So I say nothing.”</p>

   <p>Ryan points to the camera during this back and forth, so it seems like he’s well aware of it this time. I guess that’s one way to get the word out for people to stop asking about something you aren’t supposed to be talking about. We’ve reached out to Ubisoft for comment and will update the story if we hear back.</p> <p>While Ryan hasn’t returned to <em>Assassin’s Creed </em>or video games since <em>Black Flag</em>, he’s spent much of the decade since playing John Constantine in several DC Comics projects, both in live-action shows like <em>Legends of Tomorrow</em> and in animated shows and movies. Hey James Gunn, if you’re gonna bring the warlock to <a href="https://kotaku.com/superman-israel-palestine-woke-clark-kent-punk-rock-1851786212">the new DC Universe movies</a>, you should bring Ryan back as a personal favor to me. Please, and thank you.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              
              <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/bf6-battlefield-6-leak-october-launch-early-access-beta-1851786824?_gl=1*1p9xpb8*_ga*NjgyMDU5NjUzLjE3NTAwODIwMTA.*_ga_V4QNJTT5L0*czE3NTM5Njg0NTckbzg4JGcxJHQxNzUzOTczNjEyJGozOCRsMCRoMA.."><em>Battlefield 6</em> is a massive AAA first-person military shooter</a> featuring big maps, lots of guns, plenty of explosions, and some really smart changes to the classic <em>Battlefield</em> formula while staying true to older entries like <em>BF3 </em>and <em>BF4</em>. But the only thing people could talk about after playing EA’s new FPS was dragging people around.</p> <p>On July 30, I flew out to Los Angeles and, along with a bunch of other journalists and content creators, played a few hours of the upcoming <em>Battlefield 6 </em>as part of a preview event ahead of the game’s multiplayer reveal on Thursday. <a href="https://kotaku.com/preview/after-4-hours-with-battlefield-6-im-convinced-it-has-th-1851787384?rev=1753940839097&amp;_gl=1*1waadey*_ga*NjgyMDU5NjUzLjE3NTAwODIwMTA.*_ga_V4QNJTT5L0*czE3NTM5Njg0NTckbzg4JGcxJHQxNzUzOTczNjUxJGo2MCRsMCRoMA..">You can read my full thoughts on the game over here</a>, but the short version is that EA and Battlefield Studios have created a helluva chaotic and fun shooter, even if it is basically<em> Battlefield 4: Let’s Do It Again Edition.</em> It was one new mechanic though—the ability to drag injured squadmates out of harm’s way—that became one of the most talked-about features among those who played it at the event.</p> <p><iframe loading="lazy" title="Battlefield 6 Dragging System Leaked" width="500" height="281" src="about:blank" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen="" data-rocket-lazyload="fitvidscompatible" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/nF78wu3ushY?feature=oembed"></iframe></p> <p>Like in previous <em>Battlefield </em>games, players in <em>BF6 </em>don’t always “die” when they go down. Instead, they can be revived by other players. One way to do this is to play as a medic, run over to the wounded soldier with some defibrillator paddles, and give them a quick charge. This will instantly bring them back to life. And that’s fine, I guess. But the more enjoyable and exciting way to bring people back is to grab them by their bulletproof vest and drag them to safety.</p>

 <p>On PC, the platform we played on, you simply walk over to the downed player and hold E. Doing so grabs them and slowly fills up a meter that, once filled, signals the player’s revived. While you are holding them, you can move backwards and drag them away from where they fell. You don’t have to do this, but it’s often a smart move, as they were likely in a dangerous spot when they were downed. For example, during one match, my squad was taken down by snipers. I made my way to the closest downed player and dragged them into a nearby building. A moment later, they were up on their feet, and I felt like a big hero from a war movie.</p> <figure id="attachment_2000614033" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000614033"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000614033"><span>A player drags a downed squadmate to safety in footage released by EA.</span> Screenshot: EA</figcaption></figure> <p>I ended up dragging a lot of comrades around <em>Battlefield 6</em>, saving them from danger, bringing them back into the battle, and having a great time in the process. Afterward, when I talked to others who had played during the event, they often would bring up the dragging mechanic and rave about it. Even folks who weren’t as enthused with <em>BF6 </em>as I was were still big fans of heroically grabbing and pulling people to safety.</p>

 <p>Part of what makes this feature so awesome is how easy it is. It’s one button. It’s something anyone can do, but it feels <em>so </em>cool. And it also helps out a teammate, which makes you feel even better. Getting dragged is also nice. You feel so special.</p> <p>“Wow, this person really cares about me!” I would think to myself each time a random player dragged me behind some wall and out of gunfire. In reality, they just wanted to feel cool and get some extra XP. But, whatever, everyone is happy in the end. Now that’s a great way to make people work together in an online game. Take note, other shooters: This is an idea worth copying.</p> <p>I can’t wait to drag more of my buddies and squadmates when <em>Battlefield 6</em> launches on console and PC on October 10.</p> <p>.</p>
