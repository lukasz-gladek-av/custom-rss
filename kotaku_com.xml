              <p><span>In the middle of 2025, I decided to take a step back from the grind of playing the latest releases and carve out time for something I’d wanted to get around to for years: </span><a href="https://intothespine.com/2025/12/31/stories-of-2025/"><i><span>Earthbound</span></i></a><span>. I had just gotten my </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/nintendo-switch-2-review-metroid-prime-4-pokemon-2000656188"><span>Switch 2</span></a><span> and<!--StartFragment --><span>—</span><!--EndFragment -->knowing I would enjoy a lengthy honeymoon phase in which my brand new console would be all I’d want to play<!--StartFragment --><span>—</span><!--EndFragment -->decided to boot up the legendary SNES role-playing game thanks to </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/tag/nintendo-switch-online"><span>Nintendo Switch Online</span></a><span>. And I’m so glad I did, because playing </span><i><span>Earthbound </span></i><span>for the first time was one of the most joyful experiences of 2025! There are likely dozens more surprises like it waiting for me in my constantly growing backlog.</span></p> <p><span>Unlike a lot of other folks, I’m really content with the restless state of my backlog. I relish the fact, for example, that I will never entirely conquer it. How, for every two games I triumphantly finish, three more will appear in the blink of an eye. Like a boss battle or random encounter that you’re meant to lose, I eventually gave up on the notion of quashing my backlog, and I think I’m much happier as a result.</span></p>

 <p><span>Games are wonderful things. Unlike many other mediums, they drop you into the world and perspective of their characters. They are these utterly dazzling and transportive experiences, and can range from space operas to </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/red-dead-redemption-2-the-kotaku-review-1829984369"><span>melancholic westerns</span></a><span> and everything in between. I can be a squid-kid and compete in the equivalent of professional paintballing or venture through the harrowing nightmares of a </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/bloodborne-fromsoftware-rpg-goty-ps5-the-doll-1849659930"><span>gothic town descended into madness</span></a><span>. And if all else fails, I can be some plumber who has somehow found the bandwidth to do it all and then some.</span></p>

 <p><span>I love how varied and surprising exploring these virtual worlds can be. I love booting a game up and disappearing into it. I love the way I get to embody a character in games, especially in the ones that let me sculpt my own. Why would I rush that? Why should any of us try to zoom to the end of these experiences? Shouldn’t we collectively stop and take in the vistas and skyboxes of these immaculately constructed fictions? Plumb every last cave and jump behind every proverbial (or literal) waterfall in search of treasure and adventure? I want to make the most of my time with video games, not min-max it.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <figure id="attachment_2000659915" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000659915"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000659915">©Nintendo</figcaption></figure> <p><span>My backlog is lined with games that hold these promises and so much more. I mentioned space operas because–and this always shocks folks–I’ve never played the entire </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/mass-effect-5-n7-day-bioware-blog-teaser-url-krogan-2000642122"><i><span>Mass Effect</span></i></a><span> trilogy. I missed the first game on account of its exclusivity back in the day, and only hopped onboard the bandwagon with the second entry. One day, I hope to experience the first title, and I’m sure that’ll send me down a path that’ll see me revisit the entirety of the trilogy. I cannot wait to embark on that tremendous adventure with fresh eyes and a new appreciation for the entirety of that cast’s arcs. I’m also in no rush to see that day.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><span>Likewise, I’ve yet to finish </span><i><span>Baldur’s Gate 3</span></i><span>, and I’m in no rush to see it to its end, either. I’ve never played </span><i><span>Demon’s Souls</span></i><span> or the latter two </span><i><span>Dark Souls</span></i><span> games to completion. Early </span><i><span>Final Fantasy</span></i><span> games and basically any RPG that launched before the year 1997 are a blind spot for me. Foundational titles of PC gaming, like the </span><i><span>Half-Life</span></i><span> series and </span><i><span>Myst</span></i><span>, still elude me, and I never really “got” </span><i><span>The Sims</span></i><span> despite all the hype around it.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><span>I hope to get around to these games and so many more. I’ve also got a lifetime to get to ’em. Why spoil the fun by imposing challenges on myself to see as much of them as quickly or efficiently as possible? Why spoil the magic rather than live comfortably alongside it for as long as I can? What is the actual material harm of letting a backlog grow? As far as I can tell, none. On the flip side though, voraciously consuming any and every game that has ever made some kind of impression on me just sounds miserable. It minimizes what can otherwise be life-affirming, or even life-changing, experiences with art. It also just spoils the potential fun of a lifetime of games.</span></p>

 <p><span>So take this as a PSA, if you must. Slow down. Savor your video game backlog. Preserve its magic for as long as you can. Oh, and play </span><i><span>Earthbound</span></i><span>, if you haven’t. You’ll thank me later.</span></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>I consider myself a pretty big <em>Avatar</em> sicko. I can name multiple characters from the franchise. I’ve read some of the comics and played the games. I enjoyed 2009’s <em>Avatar</em> when I saw it in a big theater all those years ago. I liked 2022’s <em>Way of Water</em> even more! And yet, I<a href="https://kotaku.com/avatar-3-fire-and-ash-reviews-rotten-tomatoes-score-spongebob-squarepants-2000654602"> walked out of <em>Avatar: Fire and Ash</em> in December 2025</a> supremely disappointed. So, in a desperate attempt to feel something good about <em>Avatar</em>, I booted up Ubisoft’s 2023 open-world <em>Avatar</em> game, <em>Frontiers of Pandora</em>, and gave it another shot, and you know what, it’s so much better than <em>Fire and Ash.&nbsp;</em></p> <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/avatar-frontiers-of-pandora-impressions-review-ubisoft-1851077773">I played <em>Frontiers of Pandora</em> back when it first launched on consoles and PC around a year after <em>Way of Water</em></a>. At the time, I found the game’s narrative to be threadbare and its gorgeous jungle landscape mostly devoid of stuff to do, so after I wrote about it for the site, I mostly set the game aside. Fast forward to a late night in December 2025, feeling down about how much I didn’t like <em>Fire and Ash</em>, and I decided to return to Pandora using Ubisoft’s game.</p>

 <p>Okay, the truth is that I didn’t just return in the hopes that the game would make me feel good about <em>Avatar</em> again. I was also curious to check out <a href="https://kotaku.com/avatar-frontiers-pandora-cheap-third-person-new-game-1851786644">the big free update for the game</a> that Ubisoft released last month that added a third-person mode, alongside a new paid expansion featuring a new area. I’ve yet to play the new expansion, which stars a character from the main game fighting back against the evil RDA and their Navi allies from the Ash clan. I’ve been too busy getting lost in the world of <em>Frontiers of Pandora.</em></p>

  <h2>Pushing through <em>Frontiers of Pandora</em>‘s bad opening section</h2> <p>The first 10 hours or so of <em>Frontiers of Pandora</em> are bad. You’re stuck in one location, the quests are forgettable, and for a good chunk of that time, you don’t even have access to your Ikran, a flying dragon-like mount. Bleh! Boo! Bad. But, after pushing through it over the last few weeks, I’ve discovered there’s so much to like about <em>Frontiers of Pandora</em> once you’re past that crappy start.</p>

 <p>The biggest discovery was that beyond the jungle biome found at the start, <em>Frontiers of Pandora</em>‘s other biomes are vast and varied. One of my biggest gripes with <a href="https://kotaku.com/avatar-3-fire-and-ash-trailer-fire-clan-james-cameron-1851787146"><em>Fire and Ash</em></a> was that it felt like <em>The </em><em>Way of Water Part 2</em> and didn’t offer many new places to gawk at. <em>FoP</em> doesn’t have that problem. The vast plains you enter later in the game are incredible. Super long draw distances and massive alien trees bent over by the unrelenting wind offer up totally different vibes compared to the jungle biome of the game’s earlier section.</p>

 <figure id="attachment_2000659865" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000659865"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000659865">©Ubisoft</figcaption></figure> <p>And then, hours later, and after some quests that actually address the complicated relationship between the Navi and their human allies that make up the resistance, I visited a new biome. It is covered in mist and feels like an alien version of the forests found in the Pacific Northwest. Even hunting in this biome feels different, with strange swarms of bugs ready to descend on every carcass if you let it sit around too long without harvesting. I also found a scared and withdrawn Navi clan of former healers that is the most interesting in the game.</p>

 <p>And unlike the Ash clan featured in the latest film, they aren’t just evil warmongers, but instead are complicated beings trying to remember their place in the world while afraid of what happens if they return.</p> <p>I’m reaching the end of <em>Frontiers of Pandora,</em> and I’m not sad at all. I’m actually excited as I have two past DLCs to dive into, each adding new regions, and then I have the recently released <em>From the Ashes</em> standalone expansion to play after all that. And if all of that content can be even half as cool as what I’ve discovered on my return to Pandora, I’ll be more than satisfied that I came back to this game that had remained buried on my backlog.</p>
