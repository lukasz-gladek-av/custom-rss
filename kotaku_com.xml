Here are some of the highlights:</p><h2 id="h27146"><a id=""></a><em>Moonlighter 2</em></h2><p>Digital Sun’s shopkeeper roguelite dungeon-crawler is back with a sequel that looks even prettier and more expansive than the original 2018 game. Out in 2025,  <em>Moonlighter 2: The Endless Vault</em> will have players loot vaults for treasure that can be sold to raise funds for the revitalization of the village of Tresna. The sequel will arrive after the <em>Between Dimensions </em>DLC for the first game and alongside the full release of the equally great strategy <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/cataclismo-lego-steam-city-builder-strategy-horde-mode-1851601693?_gl=1*1ezdatm*_ga*MzQzNjkwNDM2LjE2NDY2NjQ1NzQ.*_ga_V4QNJTT5L0*MTczMzQxNDYwMC45MC4xLjE3MzM0MzE1NTUuNTguMC4w&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/cataclismo-lego-steam-city-builder-strategy-horde-mode-1851601693?_gl=1*1ezdatm*_ga*MzQzNjkwNDM2LjE2NDY2NjQ1NzQ.*_ga_V4QNJTT5L0*MTczMzQxNDYwMC45MC4xLjE3MzM0MzE1NTUuNTguMC4w">side project <em>Cataclismo</em></a></span>.</p><h2 id="h27147"><a id=""></a><em>Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Tactical Takedown</em></h2><p>Strange Scaffold, the team behind <em>El Paso, Elsewhere</em> and <em>I Am Your Beast</em>,<em>&nbsp;</em>is taking a stab at<em> TNMT </em>with a strategy spin-off. Splinter and Shredder are dead in<em> Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Tactical Takedown,</em> and the titular heroes are grumpy grownups. It sounds like a bummer, except for the interesting turn-based take on beat ‘em up combat. There will be 20 levels that mutate in real-time.</p><h2 id="h27148"><a id=""></a><em>Prologue: Go Wayback!</em></h2><p>Brendan Greene’s PlayerUnknown Productions is working on something that sounds wildly ambitious. There’s a new game engine called Melba, a three-game roadmap, and a community tech demo the size of a planet. It all begins with <em>Prologue: Go Wayback!,</em> an Early Access release planned for next year that will drop the player into a massive, randomly generated open world where they have only one goal: survive from one end to the other. </p><p>It sounds surprisingly cool, like a survival roguelike walking sim in a hyper-realistic world full of dramatic weather events and other forces of nature to overcome. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://store.steampowered.com/app/2820060/Preface_Undiscovered_World/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2820060/Preface_Undiscovered_World/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>Preface: Undiscovered World</em></a></span>, meanwhile, is a tech demo shadow-dropped onto Steam today in which players can experiment with the tools Greene’s team is using on a map the size of an actual planet.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
