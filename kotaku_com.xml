              <p><span>As the AI slop pushers get more and more bold, we’re seeing not just clear </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/clair-obscur-expedition-33-gen-ai-roblox-maelle-2000666407"><span>rip-offs of games, movies, and TV shows</span></a><span>, but also blatant copyright infringement </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/google-ai-genai-nintendo-zelda-breath-wild-mario-64-project-genie-2000664227"><span>without even attempts to mask it</span></a><span>. </span><i><span>Arcane</span></i><span>, Netflix and Riot’s acclaimed </span><i><span>League of Legends</span></i><span> animated series, is the latest victim of this, and one of the animators on the show recently denounced a “soulless and deeply disrespectful” AI mock-up of it.</span></p> <p><span>The slop comes from Seedance 2.0, a generative AI video model from Bytedance, better known as the owner of TikTok in China. The generated video shows a fight between </span><i><span>Arcane</span></i><span> and </span><i><span>League of Legends </span></i><span>characters Vi, Jinx, Ekko, and Warwick. At a glance, it definitely looks like the show, but when you watch it, something seems off.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><span>There’s an odd lack of narrative cohesion, with the video making no attempt to logically string shots together. Jinx walks away near the end to nowhere in particular, Vi straight up disappears after a brief appearance in the opening seconds, and there are several points in the brawl where the action doesn’t feel like it flows into a coherent battle.</span></p> <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">The result feels soulless and deeply disrespectful to our artists who worked incredibly hard on Arcane </p> <p>If you truly want to pay homage to the show, don’t be afraid to pick up a pencil or open a 3D software and create something from scratch, even if it isn’t professional <a href="https://t.co/uUIGH4pLEs">https://t.co/uUIGH4pLEs</a></p> <p>— Kammelin (@Lordupe) <a href="https://twitter.com/Lordupe/status/2020744211008549332?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">February 9, 2026</a></p></blockquote>  <p><span>AI shills are gassing it up as another impressive feat of expensive plagiarism for replicating Riot’s art style, but as an actual piece of animated storytelling, it’s sloppy. Kammelin, who worked on </span><i><span>Arcane</span></i><span>’s second season and is currently a production manager at Illogic Studios, said that if people want to pay tribute to the show, they should “pick up a pencil or open a 3D software,” rather than relying on generative tools that are scraping from handmade work.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><span>While we wait for the AI bubble to burst, generated art is creeping into just about every facet of pop culture. Hell, if you watched the </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/video-game-super-bowl-ad-god-of-war-pokemon-xbox-switch-1850101152"><span>Super Bowl</span></a><span> last night, you probably saw several AI-generated ads during the commercial breaks. Big tech’s push to shove AI into every corner of everything you love is affecting more than just art and animation, it’s </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/razer-ava-ai-grok-interview-slop-motoko-2000661233"><span>infected tech</span></a><span>, </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/sony-playstation-ps5-ai-genai-podcast-patent-kratos-aloy-2000665334"><span>voice acting</span></a><span>, music, </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/divinity-gen-ai-larian-bg3-reddit-ama-2000658429"><span>game development</span></a><span>, and much, much more.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><span>Companies like Microsoft that keep clogging up the internet with this garbage acknowledge that </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/microsoft-ai-slop-satya-nadella-2000656473"><span>sentiment towards AI slop is degrading</span></a><span>, and yet, here we are, watching more and more corporations insist we hork it down. So hopefully, more creators keep calling this shit out when they see it.</span></p>

              <p>The Cyborgs are coming in <a href="https://kotaku.com/helldivers-2-kotaku-review-pc-ps5-is-it-good-ps-plus-1851258251"><em>Helldivers 2</em></a>. They are fueled by rage and socialism. Sound familiar?</p> <p>A returning enemy faction from the first <em>Helldivers</em>, Cyborgs arrive in the extraction shooter’s big February 10 update to open up a new front in a multi-year galactic war full of new terrors for players to navigate. First, there are the Agitators, Automaton field commanders who will order nearby enemies to swarm you. Then there are the Radicals, Cybernetically enhanced humans who can tear you apart with techno-martial arts. Finally, there’s the Vox Engine, a dual-heavy-laser-wielding mobile tank with rockets and Gatling guns.</p> <p>Cyborgs were one of the main enemy factions in the first 2015 game. Originating from a group of human dissidents, they became the progenitors of the Automaton mech race players have been fighting in <em>Helldivers 2</em> for years now. Fans will be tasked with trying to liberate their home planet of Cyberstan from the new threat once and for all.</p>

  <p tabindex="0" role="button" aria-label="18 seconds The reports are true. This disgusting">“The reports are true,” the game’s developers state in a new trailer. “This disgusting amalgamation of man and machine, known as the cyborgs are back. Fueled by nothing but rage and socialism, the cyborgs will stop at nothing until they see our way of life destroyed.”</p> <p tabindex="0" role="button" aria-label="18 seconds The reports are true. This disgusting">So there you have it: the latest battle in <em>Helldivers 2</em> is a showdown between oil empire fascists and technology-obsessed socialists. The left-wing shift in much of the millennial generation can be traced to a fraught global war on terror, disastrous wars in the Middle East, bailing out the banks that crashed the 2008 economy, and a slow-burning cost-of-living crisis that makes them the first generation to be <a href="https://www.weforum.org/stories/2016/07/millennials-will-be-the-first-generation-to-earn-less-than-their-parents/">poorer than their boomer parents</a>. It’s unclear what’s motivating the Cyborgs.</p> <p tabindex="0" role="button" aria-label="18 seconds The reports are true. This disgusting">It’s clearly not the fight for healthcare as a human right. Those cybernetic implants go against every skincare routine that ever went viral. Maybe they’re just pissed off that they spent all their money on avocado toast instead of <a href="https://www.wsj.com/personal-finance/housing-affordability-first-time-homebuyer-new-york-61f08591?mod=e2fb&amp;utm_social_post_id=636481554&amp;utm_social_handle_id=8304333127">investing in the real estate market</a>.</p>
