It is from the devs behind <em>Tetris Effect, </em>and it looks (and sounds) awesome. This one is coming to PS5 and PSVR2 in Fall 2025.</p><h2 id="h29609"><a id=""></a><strong><em>Pragmata </em>delayed again</strong></h2><p>Capcom had a new gameplay trailer for its long-awaited space-adventure-action-horror game featuring a young robot girl and a cool astronaut dude fighting robots. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/capcom-delays-cool-looking-sci-fi-game-pragmata-to-2023-1848080969&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/capcom-delays-cool-looking-sci-fi-game-pragmata-to-2023-1848080969">The game was set to come out in 2022,</a></span> got delayed until 2023, and then got delayed again. Now it’s set to arrive in 2026. </p><h2 id="h29610"><a id=""></a><strong><em>Romeo Is A Deadman </em>looks wild</strong></h2><p>Zombies attack, nearly kill Romeo, but luckily his grandfather shoves a big sci-fi thing into his head and turns him into a sword-wielding half-dead undead killer. Okay, I’m interested. This one is “maybe” arriving in 2026. No shock that Suda51 and Grasshopper Manufacture are behind this wild-looking game. </p><h2 id="h29611"><a id=""></a><strong><em>Silent Hill F</em> arrives in September</strong></h2><p>I’m very happy that we have entered a new and better era for the <em>Silent Hill </em>franchise after so, so many years of crap and lukewarm slop. This latest entry looks very different than past games, but still seems properly foggy, spooky, and creepy. And that’s all I need in a <em>Silent Hill </em>sequel. Don’t have to wait long for this one as it launches September 25, 2025.</p><h2 id="h29612"><a id=""></a><strong><em>Bloodstained: The Scarlett Engagement </em>is revealed</strong></h2><p>Surprise! We are getting a new <em>Bloodstained </em>game. What started back in 2015 as a crowdfunded attempt to make a new <em>Castlevania</em>-inspired 2D action game has expanded into a large franchise of its own. And it’s about to get bigger when this new entry arrives sometime in the future on PS5. </p><h2 id="h29613"><a id=""></a><em><strong>Digimon Story Time Stranger</strong></em></h2><p>Wow, it’s wild how much better <em>Digimon </em>games look than <em>Pokémon </em>games. This latest time-traveling RPG set in the universe features some slick visuals and a lot of people screaming about the digital world. As someone living in 2025, I’m fine with the digital world being burned to the ground. <em>Time Stranger</em> is out October 3, 2025. </p><h2 id="h29614"><a id=""></a>And a montage of trailers and release dates: </h2><p>Sony devoted a few minutes to sharing trailers and a few bits of info on these four games, one of which is launching on PS4. Wild. </p><h2 id="h29615"><a id=""></a><em>Mortal Kombat Legacy Collection</em> looks amazing</h2><p>Digital Eclipse, the retro game wizards behind some excellent old-school video game collections, is taking on the <em>Mortal Kombat</em> series in 2025. <em>Legacy Collection</em> will contain a ton of games from the series, including handheld, console, and arcade ports, as well as rollback netcode and documentary content. I’m very excited to see more of this thing.</p><h2 id="h29616"><a id=""></a><strong>Sony is making a fight stick</strong></h2><p>Not much info beyond that. Here’s Sony’s official description of the device:</p><blockquote data-type="BlockQuote"><p>Join the fray at home or away with the Project Defiant wireless fight stick*. Take the fight to your opponents with the included sling carry case, and enjoy precise in-game response with ultra-low latency wireless and wired play options, along with a durable, ergonomic design that’s built for battle.</p></blockquote><h2 id="h29617"><a id=""></a><strong>New <em>Metal Gear Solid Delta Snake Eater</em> trailer</strong></h2><p>The<em> Ape Escape</em> mode is back and looks bigger than before. But the big news is at the very end, where Konami is teasing what looks like a multiplayer mode. Is <em>Metal Gear Online </em>returning? I hope so. </p><h2 id="h29618"><a id=""></a><strong><em>Nioh 3</em> is coming in 2026, a demo is out now</strong></h2><p>Team Ninja is back with Nioh 3. The game will let players swap between a samurai and a ninja on the fly during combat, and looks slick as heck. This one drops in 2026, but you can check out a demo for it today on PS5. </p><h2 id="h29619"><a id=""></a><strong><em>Thief</em> VR spin-off coming to PSVR2 this year</strong></h2><p>When I saw this trailer, I thought, “Hey, this looks like a new Thief game.” And I was right.<em> Thief VR Legacy of Shadow</em> arrives in 2025 and is being co-developed by Eidos-Montréal and Vertigo Games. </p><h2 id="h29620"><a id=""></a><strong><em>Tides of Tomorrow </em>looks like a colorful <em>Waterworld </em>game</strong></h2><p>I love colorful-looking games, so<em> Tides of Tomorrow</em> instantly caught my eye. The mix of online asynchronous gameplay and having to deal with other people’s decisions in a dying and flooded world sounds interesting. <em>Tides of Tomorrow</em> arrives in February 2026.</p><h2 id="h29621"><a id=""></a><strong><em>Astro Bot</em> is getting even more levels! </strong></h2><p>One of the best PS5 games ever made, <em>Astro Bot</em>, is getting even more free levels later this month. Five new levels will soon be added to <em>Astro Bot.</em> And Sony is bringing back the fan-favorite <em>Astro Bot</em> PS5 controller that sold out instantly last year.</p><h2 id="h29622"><a id=""></a><strong><em>Sea of Remnants </em>is another colorful pirate game</strong></h2><p>Wait a minute, another colorful and fun-looking ocean-based adventure game? That’s strange. But anyway, this third-person pirate game has a cool style and big bosses to fight. and ship gameplay. And mermaids. It arrives on PS5 in 2026. </p><h2 id="h29623"><a id=""></a><strong><em>Sword of the Sea </em>is coming to PS Plus</strong></h2><p>The people behind <em>Abzu </em>and <em>Pathless </em>have a new game coming out, and it looks like you’ll be doing a lot of sick sword surfing. This launches on PS Plus on August 19. </p><h2 id="h29624"><a id=""></a><strong>More games coming to PS Plus Classic Catalog</strong></h2><ul data-type="List" data-style="Bullet"><li><em>Deus Ex’s</em> PS2 port - Jun 17</li><li><em>Twisted Metal 3 </em>and <em>Twisted Metal 4</em> - July 15</li><li><em>Resident Evil 2</em> and<em> Resident Evil 3</em> - Later this Summer</li></ul><h2 id="h29625"><a id=""></a><strong>007 First Light reveals its new Bond</strong></h2><p>“Bond is a bullet without a target. Let’s give him one.” This new trailer looks exciting as heck, but I’m really bummed by how boring the new Bond looks. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/007-first-light-reveals-new-james-bond-face-ps5-trailer-1851783647&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/007-first-light-reveals-new-james-bond-face-ps5-trailer-1851783647">This is out in 2026. Read more here</a></span>. </p><h2 id="h29626"><a id=""></a><strong>Ghost of Yotei will get its own digital event</strong></h2><p>Sony is promising a big gamepaly deep dive for Sucker Punch’s upcoming samurai game. Expect to learn more in July. </p><h2 id="h29627"><a id=""></a>Arc Systems Works is making a Marvel fighting game</h2><p>Well, this is a wonderful surprise. Sony, Marvel, and Arc Systems Works (<em>Guilty Gear, BlazBlue, Dragon Ball FighterZ</em>) are teaming up to make a 2.5D Marvel comics tag-team fighting game. And it looks sick as hell. <em>Marvel Tōkon: Fighting Souls is coming out in 2026 on PS5 and PC. </em></p><p>Here’s a separate video Sony posted about how the game came about and the work going into it: </p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
