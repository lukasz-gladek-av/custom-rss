The big 4TB option doesn’t get quite as deep a cut, sitting 12% off which brings it from $301 to $265.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><p>
                  The <i>Death Stranding 2</i> director wanted to correct 'misunderstandings' on social media
                </p><div>
              
              <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/hideo-kojima-physint-od-trailer-showcase-2000627889">Hideo Kojima</a> has apparently been embroiled in a slow-moving online controversy for the past week and is now trying to definitively extricate himself and his studio from the ongoing backlash. “In light of certain misunderstandings that have arisen in some media reports and on social networks, we would like to take this opportunity to accurately convey the facts,” his studio announced on social media on Wednesday.</p>

 <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/death-stranding-2-review-is-it-good-ps5-playstation-5-1851784852">The <em>Death Stranding 2</em> director</a> shared a photo online earlier this month in which he appeared at the <span dir="auto">Lucca Comics &amp; Games convention in Italy alongside author and cartoonist Michele “Zerocalcare” Rech. Kojima was holding a Japanese copy of <em>Kobane Calling</em>, a 2015 graphic novel which illustrates the struggles of a town along the Turkish-Syrian border under threat from ISIS. Rech also recently published another graphic novel called <i>No Sleep till Shengal</i> about the <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=persecution+yazidis&amp;rlz=1C1ONGR_enUS1089US1089&amp;oq=persecution+yazidis&amp;gs_lcrp=EgZjaHJvbWUyBggAEEUYOTIICAEQABgWGB4yCwgCEAAYFhgeGMcDMg0IAxAAGIYDGIAEGIoFMg0IBBAAGIYDGIAEGIoFMg0IBRAAGIYDGIAEGIoFMg0IBhAAGIYDGIAEGIoFMg0IBxAAGIYDGIAEGIoFMgoICBAAGIAEGKIEMgoICRAAGIAEGKIE0gEIMjM0MWowajSoAgGwAgHxBfmT95DIDBFz&amp;sourceid=chrome&amp;ie=UTF-8">persecution of the Yazidis</a>.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p>But shortly after it was published on his social media channel, Kojima, famous for <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/zf3k5d/my_favourite_internet_phenomenon_is_hideo_kojima/">posting photo ops</a> with the people he meets, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/kurdistan/comments/1on6y3f/hideo_kojima_faces_backlash_from_turkish/">deleted the picture</a>.</p> <p>Kojima was seemingly spurred to erase evidence of the meeting due to an online backlash surrounding Rech’s political views. <em>Kobane Calling</em> reportedly expresses sympathy for <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/what-is-syrian-kurdish-ypg-2023-10-05/">Syrian Kurdish YPG militia forces</a> which, yes, fought against ISIS, but YPG is also <a href="https://mei.edu/publications/child-soldiers-and-ypg">accused by some international groups</a> of recruiting child soldiers and is classified by Turkey and other nations as a terrorist organization (the U.S. does not consider it a terrorist group, although it’s affiliated with the Kurdistan Workers’ Party (PKK) which the U.S. does classify as one). The plight of child soldiers was also <a href="https://metalgear.fandom.com/wiki/Child_soldier#:~:text=In%201999%2C%20the%20military%20fortress,to%20fight%20in%20future%20wars.">a frequent theme</a> throughout the <em>Metal Gear</em> series.</p>

 <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">Disappointing backpedaling. Kobane Calling is is a firsthand account of the Kurdish resistance against ISIS during the Syrian war; Zero literally traveled to a war zone to document it. It's only controversial if you think ISIS were the good guys in that scenario. <a href="https://t.co/N6G7KFGw3p">https://t.co/N6G7KFGw3p</a> <a href="https://t.co/HwD73b8b2j">pic.twitter.com/HwD73b8b2j</a></p> <p>— bidonica ❗ (@bidonica1) <a href="https://twitter.com/bidonica1/status/1988592648895291493?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 12, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <p>Rech noticed and released <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/DQoim9wjM6k/?hl=en">his own video</a> about the incident using comic illustrations. Calling Kojima the “<span dir="auto">Jesus Christ of video games,” the cartoonist said it was his publisher’s idea to share a copy of <em>Kobane Calling</em> with the famed game developer, who then voluntarily held it up for the photo op, according to <a href="https://www.ilfattoquotidiano.it/2025/11/05/zerocalcare-scoppia-la-polemica-internazionale-per-la-foto-con-hideo-kojima-al-lucca-comics-il-fumettista-ora-lo-stanno-a-tartassa/8185677/">a report</a> by Italian outlet <em>Fatto Quotidiano</em>.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p>“I opened the internet and saw two hundred Turkish sites saying that Kojima had published a post in favor of terrorism,” Rech said in the video published over a week ago, according to a Google translation. “Of course, for the Turks, they’re all terrorists, and now they’re harassing poor Kojima.”</p>

 <p>A week later, Kojima Productions finally addressed the incident with a statement throwing Rech under the bus. “There is no personal or professional relationship between the two individuals,” it declared. “The photo was taken briefly at the Lucca Comics &amp; Games venue after a short introduction through an acquaintance.”</p>

 <p>The studio continued, “Neither Mr. Kojima nor KOJIMA PRODUCTIONS had any prior knowledge or understanding of Mr. Zerocalcare’s works or political positions, and there was no intention to express agreement with, or support for, any particular stance or opinion.”</p> <p>The statement exudes a surprising amount of Ubisoft “let’s not get political” energy from the team behind a recent set of very political PlayStation blockbusters.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/super-mario-galaxy-movie-trailer-breakdown-rosalina-2000643501</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/six-takeaways-from-the-super-mario-galaxy-movie-trailer.1351378/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><span>This morning, we got the first real trailer for </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/mario-galaxy-movie-trailer-rosalina-bowser-jr-direct-2000643447"><i><span>The Super Mario Galaxy Movie</span></i></a><span>. We learned that Bowser’s still tiny, his son is coming to save him, and the fight will take Mario and his friends into space. While the movie’s title makes it sound like it’s going to be an adaptation of 2007’s excellent </span><i><span>Super Mario Galaxy</span></i><span>, the trailer includes several references to other </span><i><span>Mario </span></i><span>games beyond the cosmic Wii adventure. Let’s break down some of the big takeaways from the first trailer.</span></p>

  <h2><b>Bowser is an unrecognized artistic talent</b></h2> <p><span>The king of koopas has had a lot of time to kill while in his tiny confinement, and he’s used all that time to refine his artistic skills. Yes, turning the guy into a small version of himself and sticking him in what is essentially a pet playpen is cruel and unusual punishment; still, the guy seems to have a pretty cushy arrangement. Mario and Luigi have been kind enough to let him be true to himself in decorating his diminutive domicile, and he’s basically made a mini castle in which to spend his shrunken imprisonment. When you’re no longer trying to conquer other kingdoms, you really learn where your true talents lie, and Bowser could have had a lucrative business as an interior designer and painter. Mario tries to crush his spirits by calling his extremely detailed (and embellished) painting of him and Peach “trash,” however, resulting in a tirade from the little guy which reveals that, despite all his attempts at rehabilitation, he’s still an angry despot underneath all that unrecognized talent.</span></p>

 <figure id="attachment_2000643512" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000643512"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000643512">© Illumination</figcaption></figure> <h2><b>The team might be splitting up?</b></h2> <p><span>The first time we see any hint of the “Galaxy” side of </span><i><span>Super Mario Galaxy</span></i><span> is when a (gorgeous) meteor shower falls over the Mushroom Kingdom. Peach and Toad are then shown taking a Launch Star up into space and reaching a water-based planet full of Bloopers. Mario and Luigi, however, are shown riding motorcycles in a desert area that looks like Tostarena from </span><i><span>Super Mario Odyssey,</span></i><span> which also looks like a </span><i><span>Mad Max </span></i><span>homage. We see the inverted pyramid that was a major landmark in </span><i><span>Odyssey</span></i><span>, which means there’s no mistaking that it is definitely the Sand Kingdom from the Switch game. So it seems like Mario and his friends might be splitting up for at least part of the movie.</span></p>

 <h2><b>There’s a surprising number of </b><b><i>Super Mario Sunshine </i></b><b>references</b></h2> <p><span>Well, maybe it’s not </span><i><span>that</span></i><span> surprising considering Bowser Jr. is the main villain this time, but </span><i><span>The Super Mario Galaxy Movie </span></i><span>has some references to divisive GameCube platformer </span><i><span>Super Mario Sunshine</span></i><span>. We see Peach and Toad fighting a horde of Ninjis in what looks like a planet based on the Casino Delfino stage from </span><i><span>Sunshine</span></i><span>. Ninjis didn’t appear in </span><i><span>Sunshine </span></i><span>or </span><i><span>Galaxy</span></i><span>, so it really just seems like the movie is pulling indiscriminately from all of </span><i><span>Mario</span></i><span>‘s</span> <span>history, rather than being a more direct adaptation of the Wii game.</span></p>

 <figure id="attachment_2000643508" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000643508"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000643508">© Illumination</figcaption></figure> <h2><b>Bowser Jr. is also pulling inspiration from multiple games</b></h2> <p><span>Benny Safdie’s Bowser Jr. is seemingly taking on the main villain role in this movie, and his design and abilities seem to be a mash-up of references from different games. His base design is the classic one we see him sport in most games, complete with the bandana he wears around his neck that has a drawing of vicious, razor-sharp teeth on the front. He also wields his magic paintbrush from </span><i><span>Sunshine </span></i><span>and other appearances, but instead of using it to transform into the Shadow Mario from his debut game, he changes into the corrupted form seen in </span><i><span>Super Mario Wonder, </span></i><span>complete with a new black and purple color scheme and glowing red eyes.</span></p>

 <figure id="attachment_2000643448" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000643448"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000643448">© Illumination</figcaption></figure> <h2><b>Rosalina is a boss</b></h2> <p><span>It wouldn’t be a </span><i><span>Super Mario Galaxy </span></i><span>movie without Rosalina. </span><i><span>Captain Marvel </span></i><span>star Brie Larson is voicing the cosmic princess for the film, and in the trailer, we see that her magical powers are a force to be reckoned with. She takes out Megaleg, one of the bosses from the Wii game, like it was nothing, and she serves the whole time. Everyone is kicking ass in this trailer, but Rosalina’s magic is on another level. Love her.</span></p> <figure id="attachment_2000642906" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000642906"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000642906">Illumination</figcaption></figure> <h2><b>Yoshi is nowhere to be found</b></h2> <p><span>I guess Illumination and Nintendo don’t want to show their whole hand, but I don’t see even one reference to Yoshi in this trailer, despite the first movie teasing the dinosaur steed in its post-credits scene. There’s still plenty of time, though, as </span><i><span>The Super Mario Galaxy Movie </span></i><span>is months away. The sequel is coming to theaters on April 3.</span></p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/avatar-3-fire-ash-runtime-revealed-three-hours-long-sega-outer-worlds-2-2000643471</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/avatar-fire-and-ash-is-over-three-hours-long-so-go-to-the-bathroom-first.1351243/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Good morning, everyone. <a href="https://kotaku.com/mario-galaxy-movie-trailer-rosalina-bowser-jr-direct-2000643447">Have you seen that new <em>Mario</em> movie trailer?</a> I hope it’s good, unlike the last one. Anyway, welcome back to Morning Checkpoint, your daily round-up of news and other stuff you might care about. In this fine installment, we have info on the new <em>Avatar</em> sequel, rumors of legendary loot flooding<em> Borderlands 4</em>, a big patch for <em>Outer Worlds 2</em>, and some rare good news from the games industry.</p>

 <h2><em>Outer Worlds 2</em> gets a massive patch with over 300+ changes</h2> <p>Xbox and Obsidian’s well-reviewed <em>Fallout</em>-like RPG <em>Outer Worlds 2</em> just got a big ol’ update, and the patch notes for it are massive. Like huge! The patch notes list over 300+ bug fixes, tweaks, and changes to nearly every part of the game. <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/rpg/huge-outer-worlds-2-patch-includes-over-350-fixes-and-changes-including-a-niche-addition-that-may-be-a-direct-response-to-a-disappointed-player-on-reddit-really-cool-they-did-that/">One particular highlight, as spotted by <em>Gamesradar</em></a>, includes a change that seems to be inspired by a single Reddit user who found a creative way to complete a quest, but was denied.</p>

   <p>According to newly <a href="https://www.amctheatres.com/movies/avatar-fire-and-ash-53700">updated theater websites,</a> James Cameron’s next <em>Avatar</em> movie is going to be over three hours long. That’s not surprising. Specifically, the upcoming<em> Avatar: Fire and Ash</em> will be three hours and 15 minutes long. As an <em>Avatar</em> sicko, I’m ready and will be there day one. I’ll just make sure to empty my bladder first.</p>

 <h2>Vending machines in <em>Borderlands 4</em> seem to be giving out more legendary items</h2> <p><em>Borderlands 4</em> is filled with vending machines. Usually, these aren’t very exciting and are just used to sell loot you don’t want. But recently, players have started spotting more and more legendary items popping up in vending machines. <a href="https://www.thegamer.com/borderlands-4-vending-machine-filled-with-more-legendary-weapons/">As reported by <em>The Gamer</em></a>, players on Reddit seem to think<em> Borderlands 4</em> is being more generous on purpose by shoving more legendary items into vending machines. Maybe! But I also think it’s possible that people are just documenting this phenomenon more, and it seems like an increase as a result. Still, if you have been hunting for legendary weapons, check out some vending machines in<em> Borderlands 4.&nbsp;</em></p> <h2>Sega will raise employee pay again in 2026</h2> <p>Usually, when reporting on the game industry, it can be depressing. So it’s nice to see that Sega is doing something not terrible and is raising wages. <a href="https://automaton-media.com/en/news/sega-raises-starting-salaries-for-new-hires-and-base-pay-of-existing-full-time-employees-in-japan-again/">As spotted by <em>Automaton</em></a>, starting in April 2026, Sega will raise the base salary for all full-time employees by around 10%. It’s also upping the pay for new hires, too.</p> <h2>ICYMI:</h2> <ul> <li><a href="https://kotaku.com/elden-ring-nightreign-dlc-forsaken-hollows-artorias-dark-souls-2000643101">Here’s your first look at next month’s <em>Elden Ring Nightreign</em> DLC</a></li> <li><a href="https://kotaku.com/hades-2-story-melinoe-chronos-hecate-is-it-good-2000642943"><em>Hades II</em> isn’t a story — it’s maintenance&nbsp;</a></li> <li><a href="https://kotaku.com/proceeds-from-battlefield-6s-veterans-day-pack-dont-directly-benefit-vets-2000643014"><em>BF6</em> charity bundle isn’t actually a charity bundle</a></li> <li><a href="https://kotaku.com/fortnite-loot-boxes-gambling-roblox-2000642980"><em>Fortnite</em> will let users add loot boxes to custom games</a></li> </ul> <h2>Watch This:</h2>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/gta-6-union-rockstar-court-legal-developers-2000643478</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/union-goes-to-court-after-rockstar-refuses-to-discuss-gta-6-firings.1351237/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Almost two weeks after <a href="https://kotaku.com/gta-6-leaks-delay-developers-fired-rockstar-games-union-2000641525">31 developers were fired</a> from Rockstar Games, the union representing the former employees says the <em>Grand Theft Auto 6</em> maker has refused to meet with it to discuss what it alleges was an act of union busting aimed at disrupting ongoing organizing efforts at the UK-based studios. The IWGB now plans to move forward with legal claims against the company asserting that the firings “constitute trade union victimization and blacklisting.”</p>

 <p>A spokesperson for the union said legal claims were submitted to the country’s Employment Tribunal last Thursday and the date for an initial hearing will depend on the court’s backlog. Take-Two and Rockstar have denied allegations of mishandling the firings, claiming the employees were released for “<a href="https://kotaku.com/gta-6-leaks-delay-developers-fired-rockstar-games-union-2000641525">gross misconduct</a>” related to allegedly sharing company secrets online. The union claims discussions only took&nbsp; place in private Discord channels.</p>

 <p>In the meantime, an ongoing pressure campaign, <a href="https://kotaku.com/grand-theft-auto-6-rockstar-fired-union-workers-legal-2000643030">including picketing outside Rockstar and Take-Two’s offices</a> in the UK, has apparently failed to bring the company back to the table to discuss getting the fired developers their jobs back so they can continue working on the recently delayed blockbuster.</p>

 <p>“Despite our representation and attempts to meet with Rockstar to resolve the matter through negotiation, Rockstar have declined and persisted to terminate members of the union in a manner that is unacceptable and unlawful,” lawyers for the union wrote in a statement. “Accordingly, we have now issued formal legal claims against Rockstar on behalf of the Claimants.”</p> <p>The core of the legal fight could come down to whether individual employment contracts with the fired employees trump broader labor protections for union organizing. “We are confident that what we’ve seen here is plain and simple union busting, and we will mount a full legal defence with our expert group of caseworkers, legal officers and barristers,” IWGB president Alex Marshall said in a statement. “Employers like Rockstar would do well to understand that private spaces such as trade union Discord servers have protections, and that their company’s contractual clauses do not supersede UK law.”</p>
