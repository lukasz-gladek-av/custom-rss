              <p>Bluepoint Games, the PlayStation first-party team involved in the remakes of console exclusives like <a href="https://kotaku.com/demons-souls-on-ps5-has-still-got-it-1845648877"><em>Demon’s Souls</em></a> and<a href="https://kotaku.com/shadow-of-the-colossus-the-kotaku-review-1822531522"><em> Shadow of the</em> <em>Colossus</em>,</a> is closing in March, a source tells <em>Kotaku</em>.</p> <p>As first reported by <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/jasonschreier.bsky.social/post/3mfaauf5pek2b"><em>Bloomberg</em>‘s Jason Schreier</a>, the move comes five years after Bluepoint Games released its last project, a launch exclusive for the PlayStation 5. It was also a support studio on 2022’s <i>God of War Ragnarök</i>.</p> <p>The Texas-based studio was acquired by Sony only a few years ago in 2021 and was most recently working on a live-service project. That game, which was reportedly <a href="https://kotaku.com/god-of-war-multiplayer-bluepoint-days-gone-2-concord-1851742012">a multiplayer <em>God of War</em> spin-off</a>, was canceled early in 2025.</p> <p>Fans had been hoping for years that Sony would use Bluepoint Games to revive other PlayStation classics, including the PS4 exclusive <em>Bloodborne</em>. Throwing it onto a live service project was baffling to many, but of a piece with the PS5 maker’s disastrous campaign to create online multiplayer hits internally.</p>

 <p>Bluepoint Games was founded back in 2006 and its first game was a PSN downloadable shooter about fighting biological infections called <em>Blast Factor</em>. While that game never made the studio a household name, it quickly became a key player in helping Sony ship remasters of its back catalog. Bluepoint was responsible for the original <i>The Ico &amp; Shadow of the Colossus Collection</i> on PS3 and getting <em>Gravity Rush</em> off of PS Vita and onto PS4.</p> <p>By last count, the studio employed roughly 70 people. It’s unclear if they are all getting laid off or if some of those developers will be shifted to other parts of PlayStation Studios.</p>

              <p><i><span>Toy Story 5 </span></i><span>is probably right behind </span><i><span>Toy Story 4 </span></i><span>on the list of movie sequels we didn’t need, but the movie’s first trailer feels surprisingly timely and relevant in the age of AI threatening everyone’s jobs because rich people keep insisting it’s the future.</span></p> <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/pixar-best-movies-toy-story-nemo-incredibles-inside-out-1851785148"><span>Pixar’s latest tale of toys and tablets</span></a><span> is coming to theaters on June 19, and picks up with most of Andy’s old toys living with their new owner Bonnie, who was first introduced as a toddler in </span><i><span>Toy Story 3</span></i><span>. She’s a little bit older now and she’s less interested in dolls and action figures than she is in the shiny new tablet her parents bought her. Like all the toys, Lilypad (voiced by </span><i><span>Past Lives </span></i><span>star Greta Lee) is a sentient object in the </span><i><span>Toy Story </span></i><span>universe, and she isn’t holding back about her intentions to replace Bonnie’s obsolete toys as her favorite plaything. A lot of kids are killing time with screens these days, so it’s a good, suitable setup for a </span><i><span>Toy Story </span></i><span>movie in 2026, even if this series should have ended twice already.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><span>The trailer also reveals why Woody, who left the group to be with his long-lost love Bo Peep at the end of </span><i><span>Toy Story 4</span></i><span>, is returning for this outing. He seems to have been in contact with his old friends via a walkie talkie, and when he gets word that big tech is invading the playroom, he returns to try and help. The cowboy toy is starting to show some wear and tear, though, as he now has a bald spot where the brown paint of his “hair” has worn away over time. It’s a good bit.</span></p> <p><span>Check out the trailer below:</span></p>  <p><i><span>Toy Story 5 </span></i><span>isn’t the only Pixar movie coming out this year, as the </span><i><span>Avatar</span></i><span>-esque </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/hoppers-trailer-pixar-animation-teaser-inside-out-2-1851786456"><i><span>Hoppers</span></i></a> <span>is coming to theaters on March 6. It is, however, the first in a line of sequels the company has announced, with </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/the-incredibles-jack-black-regrets-passing-on-syndrome-villian-role-pixar-2000656750"><i><span>The Incredibles 3</span></i></a><span> and </span><i><span>Coco 2</span></i><span> also in development and just as unnecessary as a fifth </span><i><span>Toy Story</span></i><span>.</span></p>
