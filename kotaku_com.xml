Its mix of vulnerability, sentimentality, and disarming goofiness has made it a Christmas movie classic for decades, but there’s also plenty of ick. Actor Keira Knightley recently shared her own reaction to one of the movie’s most infamous scenes. </p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="197298" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="Live Forever in the Universe of 'New World: Aeternum'" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="108" data-playlist="197298,197284,197260" data-current="197298"><div><p>Live Forever in the Universe of 'New World: Aeternum'</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197298/197298_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197298/197298_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197298/197298_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197298/197298_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"></video></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>It comes near the end when all of the characters are coming to terms with their individual situations on Christmas Eve. Mark, played by Andrew Lincoln, has recently revealed that he’s in love with Juliet, played by Knightley, who happens to be married to his best friend, Peter, played by Chiwetel Ejiofor. </p><p>Mark shows up at her and Peter’s house on December 24 and delivers a presentation via boombox and cue cards explaining his feelings for her and how he will put them aside to just be friends. It’s a catharsis that only comes after she previously discovered his recording of her wedding, complete with a stalker’s focus exclusively on her. </p><p>“The slightly stalkerish aspect of it—I <em>do</em> remember that,” Knightley recently <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.latimes.com/entertainment-arts/tv/story/2024-12-05/keira-knightley-black-doves-netflix&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.latimes.com/entertainment-arts/tv/story/2024-12-05/keira-knightley-black-doves-netflix" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">told the <em>L.A. Times</em></a></span> as part of a press tour for her new Netflix thriller series <em>Black Doves</em>. “My memory is of [director] Richard [Curtis], who is now a very dear friend, of me doing the scene, and him going, ‘No, you’re looking at [Lincoln] like he’s creepy,’ and I’m like [in a dramatic whisper], ‘But it <em>is</em> quite creepy.’ And then having to redo it to fix my face to make him seem not creepy.”</p><p>In retrospect, you can still look back and read Knightley’s scrunch-faced reaction as her character being slightly put-off by the whole stunt, though the scene itself is shot and edited in such a way as to signal that we should see it all as romantic and endearing. Of course, adding to the creep factor is that Knightley was also only 17 at the time the movie was shot. “I mean, there <em>was</em> a creep factor at the time, right?” she added. “Also, I knew I was 17. It only seems like a few years ago that <em>everybody</em>&nbsp;<em>else</em> realized I was 17.”</p><p><em>Love Actually</em> came out the same year as <em>Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl</em>, which catapulted Knightley into the upper echelons of stardom. She said the ensuing hyper-scrutiny from fans, media, and others made the success come at a great cost. “I had a five-year period between the age of 17 and 21-ish, and I’m never going to have that kind of success again,” she told the <em>L.A. Times</em>. “It totally set me up for life. Did it come at a cost? Yes, it did. It came at a <em>big</em> cost. Knowing the cost, could I, in all good conscience, say to my kid, you should do that? No. But am I grateful for it? Yes. But then that’s life, isn’t it? Luckily, my kids are completely uninterested.”</p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Currently, few characters are as chaotic as Jeff the Land Shark, the strategist hero who is, at a glance, just a silly little guy. However, as <em>Marvel Rivals </em>players have learned, this happy dude is actually one of the biggest menaces in the game, and god, I hope NetEase keeps him like this forever.</p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="197298" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="Live Forever in the Universe of 'New World: Aeternum'" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="108" data-playlist="197298,197284,197260" data-current="197298"><div><p>Live Forever in the Universe of 'New World: Aeternum'</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197298/197298_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197298/197298_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197298/197298_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197298/197298_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"></video></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>Jeff is a “strategist,” the <em>Marvel Rivals </em>equivalent of a support hero. Most of the time he sprays water from his mouth to patch up teammates and leaves healing-infused bubbles around the battlefield for players to walk through and recover some of their HP. However, it’s his ultimate that has become the bane of most players’ existence. “It’s Jeff!” creates a sizable whirlpool on the battlefield, which Jeff circles before devouring any player inside the area of effect. From here, he can do one of a few things. He can chew on them as he swims around, doing small damage over time. He can spit them out, displacing them. Or, he can do what most players have learned to do and send them off the side of the map.</p><p>At first, my experience with hungry Jeffs was that players would swallow several opponents and then spit them off the map and into a chasm. As a Star-Lord main, this was usually not that big of a deal, as I could just fly right back to safety. However, as more players have used this strategy, Jeff players have wised up and realized that they’ll get more value diving off the side of the map themselves while their foes are still trapped than they will by just spitting them out and risking them returning to safety. It has become such a foolproof strategy that seemingly every Jeff player is utilizing it, and everyone else wants the land shark’s blood.</p><p>While that’s the most common strategy now, sometimes there isn’t a hole nearby, and some players are using Jeff’s ultimate as a way to throw a team off an objective or to set up other more devastating attacks, like grouping together several foes to toss them into Scarlet Witch’s explosive ultimate. Whatever strategy Jeff players are using, the character’s destructive power contrasted with his cute, unassuming demeanor has made him the center of so many jokes in the game’s community just days after launch.</p><p>We still don’t know how NetEase will balance <em>Marvel Rivals </em>in the future, but there’s part of me that hopes it stays this messy, unpolished hero shooter and “unfair,” “toxic” nonsense like Jeff’s ultimate stays in the game. Ultimately, it’ll hinge on what the studio wants for the game. Does it want <em>Marvel Rivals </em>to become a big esports sensation or does it want to keep appealing to the casual player who isn’t getting sweaty and just wants to slam their superhero toys against each other? The latter is preferable to me at this point, and the chaos of Jeff the Land Shark is one of the best examples of it.<br></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
