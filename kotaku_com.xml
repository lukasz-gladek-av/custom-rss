I don’t think it’s appropriate.” </p><p>By some estimates, average AAA game budgets have more than doubled every console generation. The first <em>Spider-Man </em>on PlayStation 4 was around $100 million to make. <em>Spider-Man 2 </em>on PlayStation 5 was over $300 million. But the games don’t sell dramatically better and are only priced $10 higher. </p><p>Some games try to make up the difference with aggressive microtransaction shops. Karch thinks part of <em>Space Marine 2</em>'s success, and the way fans flocked to it, can be attributed to its one-and-done campaign and the fact it doesn’t “milk, nickel and dime” players like live-service games. </p><p>Insomniac Games, the studio behind <em>Spider-Man 1</em> and <em>2</em>, like many teams in the video game industry over the last few years, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/what-hacked-files-tell-us-about-the-studio-behind-spide-1851115233&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/what-hacked-files-tell-us-about-the-studio-behind-spide-1851115233">suffered layoffs just a few months after the sequel came</a></span> out despite strong sales. “I don’t know how best to put it...I think if anything has contributed more to the loss of jobs, it’s the multi-hundred million dollar budget,” Karch told <em>Game File</em>.</p><p>He pitches <em>Space Marine 2 </em>as an alternative. Last year, former id Software studio director turned Saber Interactive chief creative officer, Tim Willits, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/warhammer-40k-space-marine-3-sequel-dlc-expansion-1851654810&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/warhammer-40k-space-marine-3-sequel-dlc-expansion-1851654810">told <em>IGN</em></a></span> that<em>&nbsp;</em>the sequel to the cult-favorite Xbox 360-era shooter<em>&nbsp;</em>only cost half of what it took to make <em>Doom Eternal</em>, but looks and plays equally well. No doubt part of that is due to much cheaper development costs outside of the U.S. where most of Saber Interactive’s staff work. </p><p> “We can make games [like] <em>Space Marine,</em>” Karch told <em>Game File </em>this week. “You’re not going to tell me it doesn’t have a Triple A vibe to it. You may say, ‘Oh it’s double-A plus.’ It’s a solid game. Its budget was a quarter of what anybody else would spend.” </p><p>Whether <em>Space Marine 2</em> proves to be the exception or the new rule remains to be seen. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/ps5-pro-shawn-layden-aa-space-marine-2-fortnite-1851675017&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/ps5-pro-shawn-layden-aa-space-marine-2-fortnite-1851675017">Others warn</a></span> that the mid-level space it’s playing in is essentially dead for all but the biggest standouts, swallowed up by <em>Fortnite</em>, <em>Call of Duty</em>, and other mega-hits that consume an increasing amount of money and time from a limited number of players. And the biggest game of 2025, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/gta-6-price-video-game-industry-state-of-release-date-1851740553&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/gta-6-price-video-game-industry-state-of-release-date-1851740553"><em>Grand Theft Auto 6</em></a></span>, will likely have cost way more than just $400 million to make. </p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
