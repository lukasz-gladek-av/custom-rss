              <p>On Tuesday, an Indiana Fever and Los Angeles Sparks WNBA game was <a href="https://www.espn.com/wnba/story/_/id/45911373/sex-toy-tossed-sparks-court-third-incident-7-days">temporarily disrupted after someone tossed a large green dildo</a> at the players on the court. This is the <a href="https://www.facebook.com/watch/?v=1760105008213278">third such incident</a> of a sex toy being tossed onto a WNBA court during an active game in the last two weeks. And with some betting markets now taking bets on whether or not a dildo will be tossed at WNBA players at future games, it’s very likely this terrible trend will continue, even as the WNBA reportedly looks to ban fans from bringing bags into venues in an effort to prevent this from happening.</p> <p>The first incident of a dildo being thrown onto a <a href="https://kotaku.com/nba-2k-announces-wnba-players-a-river-of-sexism-follow-1837111136">WNBA</a> court happened on July 29 during a match between the Golden State Valkyries and the Atlanta Dream. Like what happened on Tuesday, a neon green dildo was reportedly thrown onto the court. On August 1, a similar incident involving a sex toy happened during a match between the Valkyries and the Chicago Sky. There are also at least two reports via social media of people attempting to toss dildos onto the court at other WNBA games, but these didn’t make it out of the crowd.&nbsp; However, one of these sex toys, also neon green, reportedly thrown during an <a href="https://x.com/osnapitsari/status/1952914027618943453">August 5 WNBA game in New York City</a>, came close to hitting a child. It’s clear this is becoming a “thing” and players and coaches are understandably frustrated and upset about the situation.</p> <p>“I think it’s ridiculous, it’s dumb, it’s stupid,” Sparks coach Lynne Roberts said after the game on Tuesday. “It’s also dangerous, and players’ safety is number one. Respecting the game. All those things. I think it’s really stupid.”</p> <p>On August 1, <a href="https://x.com/OMG_itsizzyb/status/1951462340890861689">New York Liberty&nbsp;forward&nbsp;Isabelle Harrison posted on social media</a>: “ARENA SECURITY?! Hello??! Please do better. It’s not funny. never was funny. Throwing ANYTHING on the court is so dangerous.”</p> <p><a href="https://www.talkbasket.net/201156-wnba-enforces-no-bag-policy-to-stop-dildo-throwers">Polymarket Sports is reporting</a> that the WNBA is enacting a ban on bags at some upcoming games. However, I was <a href="https://sports.yahoo.com/article/no-bag-policy-wnba-games-234957914.html?guccounter=1&amp;guce_referrer=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZ29vZ2xlLmNvbS8&amp;guce_referrer_sig=AQAAAIkDZKqrCCX828IDt1RKFGShi0R616NjV0DwR8coONtETZz7gAejcUjpqB0mtSlMwCAmHfs7CXFv-TFrRNg-FV226KCC0yhNs9GP1TqjuqoyMicJ-eEuRHINLQHy0fdcLAMbrXBKCut1eoQ3s4WfGaZqDJw2rFQdZM_pprHaYDp1">unable to corroborate this claim</a>, and Polymarket itself might have a vested interest in the dildo tossing as the gambling site is <a href="https://polymarket.com/event/dildo-thrown-at-wnba-game-on-august-6-13/will-a-dildo-be-thrown-onto-the-court-at-a-wnba-game-on-wednesday?tid=1754503557149">now taking bets on whether sex toys will be tossed at WNBA games</a>. Yes, we are living in a timeline where people are betting on whether someone will toss a sex toy at professional female athletes just trying to play basketball. Shit sucks.</p> <p>On August 2, police in College Park, Georgia, arrested 23-year-old Delbert Carver, the man who allegedly tossed the first dildo during the Valkyries/Dream game.&nbsp; According to law enforcement, he <a href="https://www.espn.com/wnba/story/_/id/45901403/wnba-fan-accused-throwing-sex-toy-faces-multiple-charges" target="_blank" rel="noopener">faces counts of disorderly conduct, public indecency, and criminal trespass</a>. In an affidavit, as reported by ESPN, Carver admitted that tossing the dildo onto the court was “supposed to be a joke” and that it was “supposed to go viral.” Sadly, it seems like it has, and copycats are now tossing more green dildos onto WNBA courts.</p> <p>Not only is this dangerous and annoying for players, but throwing sex toys onto the court of a WNBA game is <a href="https://www.cosmopolitan.com/entertainment/celebs/a65614990/why-throwing-dildos-wnba-games/">clearly a misogynistic act against these women</a> who dare to be professional athletes. In an era when professional women’s sports are thriving, <a href="https://www.nielsen.com/insights/2023/womens-sports-viewership-on-the-rise/">with high ratings and stars being created</a>, it’s clear some young men, likely fueled by anti-women politics and the horrible online manosphere, feel empowered and even forced to “fight back.” Tossing dildos at women is done to embarrass them and remind them that, according to these shitbags, they are only sex objects who shouldn’t be playing basketball in front of adoring crowds of fans. Hopefully, WNBA security steps things up and we can stop this shit from happening in future games.</p>
