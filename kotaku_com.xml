            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Carrying a separate charger for all your devices – from smartphones to laptops, tablets, earbuds, and smartwatches – can be inconvenient, especially if you’re trying to travel light. This is where a multi-port charger can come in handy, and today is a great time to grab one.</p>
<p>Anker makes some of the best portable charging solutions around, as right now, <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6524/">you can snap its 67W Anker Prime USB-C charger with 3 ports for just $37 at Amazon.</a> That’s after a nice 25% discount. The offer is open to both Prime and non-Prime members, plus shipping is free for all shoppers!</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6524/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Power Multiple Devices at Once</h2>
<p>It’s a compact block that’s around 51% smaller than the original 67W MacBook charger. The prongs fold in when not in use, which makes the thing quite easy (and safe) to carry around with you on the go. Small size doesn’t mean a compromise on performance, though.</p>
<p>The charger comes with a total of three ports, including 2 USB-C ports and 1 USB-A port. These are enough to juice all your essentials up at the same time, whether it’s your phone, laptop, or headphones. Connecting a single device lets you enjoy an efficient output of 67W, while the 65W max two-port charging cuts down on charging time by up to 34%. You won’t have to stay tethered to an outlet for long, even when powering multiple devices at the same time. The maximum output of 65W is available whether you’re using both USB-C ports or a mix of USB-C and USB-A. Compatibility-wise, the charger plays nicely with a wide range of devices, from iPhone Series 12 to 17, Samsung Galaxy phones, MacBooks, Pixel phones, iPads, and more.</p>



<p>Stability comes from the combination of partially covered pins and an innovative stacked design that keeps the charger firmly in place. GaNPrime Tech, paired with an upgraded ActiveShield 2.0 system, allows for better heat management and increased security, so you won’t have to worry about dealing with overheating, either.</p>
<p>We highly recommend this charger to anyone who is looking for a no-fuss power solution that can juice multiple devices at once. It’s going to be a great addition to work stations. The compact size makes it just as easy to carry around; simply plug it into an outlet in a cafe, coworking space, or the airport, and keep your devices up and running. This deal brings its price down to just $37, which is nothing considering the convenience and peace of mind it gets you. The box comes with the charger itself, a welcome guide, and a worry-free 24-month warranty for some extra peace of mind.</p>
<p>Getting your orders in today will help get the charger delivered before Christmas, which is great if you’re planning to go on a well-deserved trip during the holidays, and don’t want to carry multiple adapters for a bunch of gadgets.</p>

              <p>A great pair of headphones can change the way you enjoy your favorite media. You can drop a lot of cash on one, but you need to make sure you get a brand that can actually deliver. And you’ll also want to find some that you won’t have to spend an arm and a leg on. We found some great Sony headphones that are not only discounted, but they’re lightweight, cushioned, and built to fit well for long listening sessions. And best of all, you can get them on sale right now.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6523/">The Sony ULT WEAR Over-Ear Noise Canceling Bluetooth Headphones are up over at Amazon for just $148, down from their usual price of $250.</a> That’s a discount of $102 and 41% off. Not too shabby for a pair of great headphones from a reputable brand.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6523/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Comfortable headphones perfect for just about any use case</h2>
<p>These headphones are prided on how comfortable they feel. The ear cups offer extremely soft padding so you can wear them for hours without discomfort. If you’re used to earbuds that can sometimes pinch the insides of your ears, that could be a major game-changer. The headband is adjustable too, so you can find a fit that feels right for you. They won’t squeeze your head or ears too tightly either, something that ends up happening with far too many models.</p>
<p>The active noise canceling feature really stands out. It helps reduce background noise from things like traffic, conversations, or airplane engines so you can enjoy cleaner sound. Whether you want to concentrate on a podcast or just enjoy silence during a busy commute, the noise canceling makes a noticeable difference. You also have the option to let in some ambient sound without removing your headphones if you need to be aware of your surroundings.</p>



<p>Battery life is strong too and you can expect many hours of playback on a single charge. That means you can get through a long flight, a work day, or a weekend trip without needing to plug in. This pair also recharges quickly, so you don’t have to sit around waiting for long to get them back up to a level that you can listen at.</p>
<p>Overall, the Sony ULT WEAR Over-Ear Noise Canceling Bluetooth Headphones deliver comfort, quality, and quiet listening in a package that works for many situations. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6523/">And at the current price of $148 on Amazon, down from $250, these headphones are a solid value.</a> They’re a great pick for anyone who needs great sound, a lengthy battery life, and plenty of features that make them a fantastic-sounding pair of headphones. Don’t miss out and snag the deal while you still can.</p>
