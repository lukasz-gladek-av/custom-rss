              <p>Itch.io, the indie gaming store<a href="https://kotaku.com/itch-io-nsfw-porn-games-delisted-collective-shout-1851786841"> that recently pulled all NSFW games from its site</a>, is beginning the process of “re-indexing” adult games. At the moment, this is only affecting free games, and the site is still in discussions with payment providers over how it can return paid-for NSFW games without facing penalization.</p> <p>This all came about after an Australian anti-porn pressure group, Collective Shout, campaigned payment providers to stop working with gaming stores that sold games of which it did not approve. First, <a href="https://kotaku.com/steam-valve-adult-content-sex-games-online-safety-act-1851786391">Valve removed hundreds of adult games from Steam</a>, while introducing new and incredibly ambiguous rules about what was acceptable. Then soon after, Itch followed suit, but in a far more dramatic fashion, de-listing any game marked as “adult” or “not safe for work” from the store’s searchable pages. In the process, large numbers of games that in no way contravened even the most broad notions of acceptability were caught in the crossfire, and inevitably many of them were representing LGBTQ+ subjects.</p> <p>Now, itch.io founder Leaf Corcoran <a href="https://itch.io/t/5149036/reindexing-adult-nsfw-content">has released a statement</a> saying the store is bringing back free NSFW games, but is “still in ongoing discussions with payment processors,” meaning paid games will be reintroduced “slowly.”</p> <p>To get an NSFW game back on Itch today, developers must check the “No payments” box on their dashboard, making their game not only free, but also unable to accept optional payments from customers. Itch’s excellent systems usually allows customers to pay the asking price for a game, or opt to pay more if they wish. That allows developers to price their games as free but still receive payments from those who want to. That’s currently unavailable for any adult games.</p> <p>Leaf’s post explains that Itch spoke with its primary payment provider Stripe, with which it’s worked for a decade, and has been told they will “not be able to” take payments for “content designed for sexual gratification.” That ludicrously ambiguous phrase is helpful to precisely no one, given <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rule_34">Rule 34</a> and the infinite reaches of kink. However, Stripe does seem to be making some progressive noises. The company asked Itch to share a statement:</p> <blockquote><p>“Stripe is currently unable to support sexually explicit content due to restrictions placed on them by their banking partners, despite card networks generally supporting adult content (with the appropriate registrations). Stripe has indicated that they hope to be able to support adult content in the future.”</p></blockquote> <p>Itch says as a result of this it’s now speaking to other payment processors to try to find a company that can cover what Stripe will not. In the meantime, NSFW games that do not violate Stripe’s current definition of unacceptability will be reviewed and possibly re-listed.</p> <p>The situation, no matter anyone’s opinion on the nature of the games being disallowed, remains deeply concerning. We are seeing multiple stores explaining to customers that their actions are now dependent upon what payment processors will tolerate, given any online store can be held to ransom by these corporations. If you cannot process a payment, you can’t sell a game, and it’s all or nothing. Thanks to the efforts of these ideologically driven pressure groups, companies like Visa, Mastercard, Stripe and the rest fear being associated with controversial adult content, and will simply refuse to work with stores that don’t adhere to their unclear and ever-changing limits. In other words, the moralities of a pressure group dictate the nature of what can be sold on a gaming store, because of the pusillanimous nature of the corporations in the middle.</p>

              <p>It’s fair to say that Nintendo’s had a pretty good few months. After just four days, <a href="https://kotaku.com/nintendo-switch-2-sales-fastest-selling-console-ever-1851784293">the Switch 2 had sold 3.5 million units</a>, making it the most successful console launch of all time. <a href="https://www.nintendo.co.jp/ir/pdf/2025/250801e.pdf">Nintendo is now reporting</a> it sold just shy of six million Switch 2s in the system’s first month, along with 8.6 million games. Of those, an incredible 5.63 million are copies of<em> Mario Kart World</em>. Alongside that, the console company still sold a million new Switch 1s in three months, and over 24 million games for that system. All told, from April to June, the company made sales of 572 billion yen, or $3.8 billion. It’s good to be Nintendo right now.</p> <p>All those numbers take us up to the end of June, meaning there’s actually a whole other month of as-yet unreported Switch 2 sales to take into account, meaning that number is likely closer (by our estimate) to eight million, ahead of Nintendo’s expectations, and well on the way to the company’s goal of 15 million units by March 2026. And don’t forget, they’ve got 2025’s holiday season to come before then.</p> <p>Interestingly, digital sales were down over 13 percent on the same quarter last year, which Nintendo attributes to, er, “a decrease in sales of downloadable versions of packaged software.” Well, yeah, selling fewer digital games would certain explain the lower sales of digital games. Piercing insight. There was also a drop in what Nintendo calls “IP related business,” down 4.4 percent, which is explained by “a decrease in movie-related revenue.” That’s actually a pretty impressively small drop, given it’s two years since&nbsp;<em>The Super Mario Bros. Movie</em> was released.</p>

 <p><em>Mario Kart World</em>‘s sales of almost six million, in large part a consequence of the game being offered as a bundle with the Switch 2 itself, make it the most successful <em>Mario Kart</em> launch ever–that’s pretty stunning given there was no previously established userbase for the console. For context,&nbsp;<em>Mario Kart Wii</em> launched two years after the Wii came out, and sold an estimated 4.7 million copies in its first four months. <em>Mario Kart 7</em> was limited by the low sales of the 3DS, but <em>Mario Kart 8</em> had the reverse effect, causing people to finally buy the unloved Wii U, selling nearly 3 million copies in its first month. However, it only reached 8.5 million lifetime sales. <em>Mario Kart 8 Deluxe&nbsp;</em>on the Switch is still the big leader, with astonishing lifetime sales of over 64 million copies, but even that was slower out of the gates than <em>Mario Kart World</em>. That game took a year to get to nine million copies, meaning&nbsp;<em>World</em> is well on its way to smashing that number.</p> <p>It’s notable that given 5.82 million Switch 2s have been sold (and that’s sold to real people, rather than just shipped to stores), and 5.63 million copies of&nbsp;<em>Mario Kart World</em>, that the game is almost ubiquitous among the console owners. That means people who didn’t opt for–or were unable to buy–the bundle have been buying a separate copy anyway. Yes, fair enough, it’s not like people were spoiled for choice when the Switch 2 launched, but it remains a remarkable number. It’ll be fascinating to see how&nbsp;<em>Donkey Kong Bananza</em> has sold, and even more fascinating to visit the alternate reality where Nintendo had that game ready for launch.</p>
