Game Freak is giving a shiny version out to anyone who has completed the Hisui Pokédex and deposited those Pokémon into the <em>Pokémon Home </em>storage app. So if you’ve caught all the Pokémon in <em>Legends: Arceus</em> and registered the completed Pokédex in <em>Home</em>, you’ll be rewarded with a shiny Enamorus: a brighter shade of pink than her normal form. There is no expiration on this offer, so if you haven’t finished the Pokédex, you don’t need to worry about scrambling to claim the shiny Fairy/Flying genie.</p><p>The second shiny Pokémon Game Freak is giving out is Manaphy. The fourth-generation mythical water-type creature was introduced as an event Pokémon in the original <em>Diamond </em>and <em>Pearl</em>.

To be clear, this does not mean you have to finish the entire National Dex including every Pokémon from all four generations—you’ll just need to catch the 151 from Turtwig to Manaphy, and then you’ll get a Manaphy with a blue-green color scheme.</p><p>Whether you’re a shiny hunter or not, everyone will have new Pokémon to chase later this year when <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/pokemon-legends-z-a-predictions-mega-evolution-kalos-1851316456&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-legends-z-a-predictions-mega-evolution-kalos-1851316456"><em>Pokémon Legends: Z-A</em></a></span><em> </em>launches on the Switch.

Stop it! Everyone just stop it!

These inverted parasocial relationships, where the audience believes itself in authority over the subject, are having a grim effect on culture. We’ve reached a position where a director is immediately defending himself against an onslaught of wildly inaccurate and frankly concerning criticism from those who believe themselves in charge of how an unreleased film is supposed to be. And, as a consequence, those with the money are starting to believe this madding crowd needs to be heard.</p><p>On January 26, James Gunn—the director of the <em>Guardians of the Galaxy</em> movies, and the person now in charge of DC’s cinematic universe—shared via X a new teaser for his forthcoming <em>Superman</em>.</p><p>I am a Superman skeptic. Not a <em>Superman</em> skeptic, because I’ve yet to see the movie that hasn’t been released, so have no rational basis on which to form an opinion. But boy do I have Superman opinions. I dislike how people making films or TV shows never seem to know how to cope with this specific character, seeing his innate, all-powerful nature as an issue that needs to be removed. That’s a fascinating problem to solve! You have this essentially immortal god, a being of absolute power to tell stories about, but no one seems to know how to portray him without instantly resorting to reducing him to mortality, whether by weakening him or opposing him with an equally powerful enemy. I have a “Time to Kryptonite” meter on which all Superman fiction is judged, and almost all of it fails miserably. (I know nothing about comics, including <em>Superman </em>comics, and expect this has all been far more interestingly investigated there.)</p><p>I must make an aside for the recently concluded <em>Superman &amp; Lois</em>, that repeatedly failed on Time to Kryptonite in every one of its arcs, but actually handled the challenge better than everything else. It showed Superman’s genuine, consequential vulnerabilities: his love for his family, his grief for his parents, his terror at his wife’s cancer, his panic at his son’s crippling anxiety disorder. All of this made an immortal figure meaningful, albeit constantly undermined by yet another weaker enemy using various colors of Kryptonite to punch him in the face.</p><p>I worry James Gunn’s movie could repeat the same issues, taking this fascinating dilemma of an invulnerable hero, and rendering it moot by saying some green rocks make it go away. That would be disappointing. However, I’m not organizing a campaign to demand he not do this, nor declaring the film will be obsolete should he do so. I’m not under any delusion that I’m in any form of dialogue with this piece of art: I will be its supplicant viewer.</p><figure id="" data-id="d001153c787c3fd5758739cc25ee9082" data-recommend-id="image://d001153c787c3fd5758739cc25ee9082" data-format="jpg" data-width="1791" data-height="1008" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A fire-breathing lizard beast in the streets of Metropolis." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A fire-breathing lizard beast in the streets of Metropolis." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Warner Bros. / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="d001153c787c3fd5758739cc25ee9082" data-recommend-id="image://d001153c787c3fd5758739cc25ee9082" data-format="jpg" data-width="1791" data-height="1008" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A fire-breathing lizard beast in the streets of Metropolis." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Not so for those who responded to Gunn’s short clip. The 30 seconds of context-less images includes three seconds of Superman flying through some ice, presumably near his Fortress of Solitude. I watched it and thought this: “There’s Superman, flying past some ice. Ooh, he rolled over.” I had no further thoughts about that moment, more interested in other aspects like the role of the yellow flag and the potential silliness of a Godzilla-like creature rampaging through Metropolis.</p><p>But this, I have since learned, is not how the film’s “fans” responded. They are <em>furious</em> about those three seconds of flying. Livid. Their reaction has become “viral.” It has offended vast numbers of people who believe themselves the movie’s core audience, and they’re explaining to Gunn in their thousands about how he’s misused CGI, the ways in which he’s messed up some face-replacement technology, and how actor David Corenswet’s eye is millimeters out of line and thus the film is a disaster. (I wish any of this was an exaggeration.)</p><p>This reached such a pitch that Gunn felt the need to respond (nooooo!) <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.threads.net/@jamesgunn/post/DFVZvy0A1sd&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.threads.net/@jamesgunn/post/DFVZvy0A1sd" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">on Threads</a></span>, calmly stating that the entire furor over his CG-based crime exists only in the imaginations of the angry mob.</p><p>“There is absolutely zero CG in his face,” Gunn explains. “People’s faces can look different when you put a wide angle lens up close. The background plate in Svalbard is 100% real as is David.”</p><p>So yeah, the criticisms were conspiracies, entire mobs built around this unforgiveable faux pas that hadn’t taken place. They needed to find <em>something</em> wrong, something that couldn’t pass their perfection test, grabbed hold of this (despite the damned Godzilla), and were utterly wrong. It was only ever a cool, practical flying effect, like it looked.</p><p>The endless criticisms about Corenswet’s eyes gets to me more than anything else. Firstly, it’s something people spotted by pausing a three second clip on a monitor in front of their face, forgetting that this is a movie intended to be watched in a theater and no rational person would even study the exact positions of his eyeballs in those circumstances. It’s a fuss about <em>nothing</em>. And what if those are just his eyes?! For God’s sake, the actor who plays Lois in <em>Superman &amp; Lois</em>, Elizabeth Tulloch, has strabismus, meaning her eyes point in slightly different directions at all times. It’s a normal thing. God,  you awful people.</p><figure id="" data-id="0afd57c7072077cfb6b536a453cdfd0f" data-recommend-id="image://0afd57c7072077cfb6b536a453cdfd0f" data-format="jpg" data-width="1700" data-height="956" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Superman, bruised and cut, lying in the snow." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Superman, bruised and cut, lying in the snow." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Warner Bros. / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="0afd57c7072077cfb6b536a453cdfd0f" data-recommend-id="image://0afd57c7072077cfb6b536a453cdfd0f" data-format="jpg" data-width="1700" data-height="956" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Superman, bruised and cut, lying in the snow." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>I can’t tell you the number of podcasts and YouTube channels I’ve given up on, because the creators spend their entire time worrying about, or directly responding to, the loudest voices in their audience. I struggle to think of any I’ve stuck with that aren’t plagued by this issue. A constant, spoken concern about the portion of their audience who doesn’t like, or doesn’t accept, or doesn’t tolerate, some small aspect of what they do. It’s mostly delivered jokingly, “Ooh, don’t say that, you know what our DMs will be like!” but it’s never with any humor. It’s fear. A show’s fans can cause its creators fear.</p><p>And the mistake is the two-way engagement. Before the internet, the movies, TV shows, books, games, plays, whatever, were the authority. They defiantly existed, and the audience either liked them or disliked them in futile near-privacy. The audience’s means of affecting the art’s&nbsp;existence lay purely in choosing whether to continue being the audience. If they didn’t like the show, they didn’t tune in. If they hated the book, they didn’t buy the next one. They could tell their friends to join or not join the audience, and that was effective, but based on their own real-life relationships. Sure, critics had some influence too, but this again was a one-way communication with an audience that mutely chose whether to engage.</p><p>And movies and TV shows and games weren’t worse for it back then! It turns out, they didn’t need to be told what to do by an audience that hadn’t yet watched or read or played them in order to create excellent art. Based on the thousands of years of evidence, it’s perhaps reasonable to conclude it’s not a vital part of the creative process. Yet, today, a piece of media’s purported audience sees itself as so utterly crucial that without its constant input, only terrible things can result.</p><p>“Thank goodness we were there to tell James Gunn not to use bad CG on Superman’s face in that one flying scene!” <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXuDCDE7vmg&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXuDCDE7vmg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">they tell themselves</a></span>, likely never bothering to listen to the response that there was no CG, good or bad. Almost definitely not replying to say, “Oh, I’m sorry, I was completely wrong.” (I checked. They didn’t.)</p><p>Instead, when their fury is contradicted by regular people saying, “Ooh, I enjoyed that teaser! Can’t wait to see the movie!” their reaction is to create even more elaborate, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oa79mQ9tpKs&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oa79mQ9tpKs" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">deranged theories</a></span> that explain these normal people as evil agents.</p><figure id="" data-id="414a25f8fde78b1b0dd69cd95a7fd891" data-recommend-id="image://414a25f8fde78b1b0dd69cd95a7fd891" data-format="jpg" data-width="1750" data-height="984" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Superman protects a small child from an explosion of cannisters." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Superman protects a small child from an explosion of cannisters." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Warner Bros. / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="414a25f8fde78b1b0dd69cd95a7fd891" data-recommend-id="image://414a25f8fde78b1b0dd69cd95a7fd891" data-format="jpg" data-width="1750" data-height="984" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Superman protects a small child from an explosion of cannisters." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>But this obviously isn’t unique to this incident. It’s everything, all of the time, this irrationally entitled belief that the media you consume owes you something. That you are the authority now, that the subject must bend to your whim, and deviance from this is terrible customer service that must be punished. It’s horrible.</p><p>Everyone’s liking everything wrong, and it’s spoiling it! For god’s sake, all creators, you have to stop responding to these voices, too. They aren’t your audience, and when you listen to them, you misrepresent the vast majority of people who are waiting to enjoy your output. Whether it’s a podcast constantly falling over itself to avoid an email, or a movie studio panicking because some loud group of dumbasses made a bunch of YouTube videos, just ignore them. They will never be satisfied, it will never be good enough, and their motivations are suspect and unspecific. </p><p>If only our artists would re-establish and reinforce the one-way relationship, reclaim the authority. And then once something exists, listen to curated, informed voices whose goal is to see something be the best it can be, not to tear it down to bathe in its entrails.</p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Now, one of those collectors has investigated the prototype cards they bought more thoroughly and made a terrible discovery: they were seemingly printed only just last year. “I will lose thousands,” they told fellow fans.</p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="196165" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="What’s Coming Out Beyond Pokémon: The Indigo Disk | The Week In Games" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="95" data-playlist="196165,194907,194141" data-current="196165"><div><p>What’s Coming Out Beyond Pokémon: The Indigo Disk | The Week In Games</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196165/196165_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196165/196165_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196165/196165_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196165/196165_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/21711.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>The collector in question, as first <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.pokebeach.com/2025/01/millions-of-dollars-of-prototype-pokemon-cards-may-be-forgeries-retired-creatures-employee-involved&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.pokebeach.com/2025/01/millions-of-dollars-of-prototype-pokemon-cards-may-be-forgeries-retired-creatures-employee-involved" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">reported by <em>PokéBeach</em></a></span>, is a user <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.elitefourum.com/t/many-of-the-pokemon-playtest-cards-were-likely-printed-in-2024/52421&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.elitefourum.com/t/many-of-the-pokemon-playtest-cards-were-likely-printed-in-2024/52421" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">who goes by pfm on the Elite Forum discussion boards</a></span> where people facilitate trades, analyze market trends, and scrutinize auction prices for the rarest cards.

On January 26, user pfm shared several examples of early test cards that displayed printer metadata suggesting they were actually created in 2024, including even some signed by Akabane. The alleged discovery has made the entire collection suspect in some collectors’ eyes, as fans speculate about how a possible scam might have been orchestrated, including the potential use of high-quality original art leaked in the past.</p><p>“It was really disheartening to find this out,” pfm <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.pokebeach.com/2025/01/millions-of-dollars-of-prototype-pokemon-cards-may-be-forgeries-retired-creatures-employee-involved&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.pokebeach.com/2025/01/millions-of-dollars-of-prototype-pokemon-cards-may-be-forgeries-retired-creatures-employee-involved" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">told <em>PokeBeach</em></a></span>. <br>“More than the financial aspect, I thought it was cool to own a piece of history and it’s unfortunate it turned out this way.” It’s still unclear how many of the hundreds of cards sold may indeed be fakes, and if Akabane was aware or just duped like everyone else. Collectors who were already unsure about test card auctions last year are now being extra critical of grading house CGC as well. </p><p> “We’re aware of recent claims regarding CGC graded Pokémon Prototype and Playtest cards that have been sold across various platforms,” one of the sellers,  Alt auction house, told <em>PokéBeach</em> in a statement. “CGC has assured us they are taking these allegations seriously and are conducting a thorough review. We’re staying in close communication with CGC and will share updates as they become available.”</p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
