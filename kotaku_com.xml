              <p>This summer, Nintendo raised the prices of it’s previous generation Nintendo Switch consoles following President Donald Trump’s announcement to impose new tariffs on a range of countries. The base model Nintendo Switch, which originally launched at $300, is now sold for $340 new. You can, however, find the Nintendo Switch for much less than even the starting price. Buying refurbished hardware is a great way to save some money while refreshing what you play or work with. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4528/">Amazon has a renewed Nintendo Switch on sale for $227</a>. That’s 24% less than the original value it sold for from 2017 to the beginning half of this year and 33% less than it’s new selling price for 2025.</p>
<p>It may seem like a weird time to dip into this eight year old gaming console. This summer, the next generation of Nintendo consoles launched with the Switch 2 after all. However, if you missed out on this chapter from the Japanese game and hardware developer, there is a treasure trove of amazing games just waiting for you to experience.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4528/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Massive Library of Hit After Hit</h2>
<p><em>Animal Crossing: New Horizons</em> is a wonderful little life sim that many Nintendo fans and even folks who wouldn’t normally describe themselves as gamers found solace in during the 2020 lockdown. <em>The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild</em> and its sequel <em>The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom</em>&nbsp;can provide hundreds of hours of discovery, adventure, a problem-solving for any eager player looking to get lost in a beautiful open world.</p>
<p>Beyond just the first party stuff, the Nintendo Switch has countless indie titles for you to sink your teeth into. Games like <em>Celeste</em> and&nbsp;<em>Sea of Stars</em> are routed in the side-scrolling platformers and JRPGs of the Super Nintendo era. The Switch is still receiving new titles as well. Two of the best indie games in the console’s history are Supergiant Games’&nbsp;action roguelike&nbsp;<em>Hades</em> along with Team Cherry’s grueling Metroidvania&nbsp;<em>Hollow Knight</em>. Both titles received sequels this past month —&nbsp;<em>Hades II </em>and <em>Hollow Knight: Silksong </em>—&nbsp;which are available for the original Nintendo Switch.</p>



<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4528/">As a renewed gaming console, the Nintendo Switch you receive after ordering is confirmed to have been professionally inspected, tested, and cleaned by Amazon-qualified suppliers</a>. Your console is guaranteed to have no visible cosmetic imperfections when held at arm’s length and is even eligible for replacement or refund within the first 90 days of receipt if you aren’t satisfied with the purchase.</p>

              <p>As reported by&nbsp;<a href="https://mynintendonews.com/2025/10/05/nintendo-is-requesting-4500000-in-damages-from-a-switch-piracy-reddit-mod/"><em>My Nintendo News</em></a>, Nintendo is continuing to pursue its <a href="https://kotaku.com/nintendo-switch-reddit-switchpirates-court-filing-1851710042">attempts to take down members of a Switch piracy Reddit</a>, and more specifically the sub’s moderator, James Williams, known as Archbox. As with most of Nintendo’s court targets, he was seemingly given an opportunity to walk away and chose not to take it. As <em>Kotaku</em> mentioned in July 2024, <a href="https://kotaku.com/nintendo-switch-piracy-hacked-roms-emulator-1851572451">Nintendo had sent Archbox cease-and-desist letters which the company alleges he chose to ignore</a>. As a result of that, court filings were made and it seems Archbox ignored those too. Now the company is demanding $4,500,000 in a default ruling.</p> <p>Nintendo’s ongoing pursuit of all involved in potential piracy of their consoles and games would be proving quite the revenue stream for the company, if it ever demanded the millions of dollars from people who could actually pay. After <a href="https://kotaku.com/nintendo-lawsuit-modding-switch-2-ryan-daly-2000623984">successfully suing Modded Hardware’s Ryan Daly last month for $2 million</a> that he’ll never be able to give them, bringing about <a href="https://kotaku.com/bowser-agrees-to-pay-nintendo-10-million-in-hacking-la-1848172917">the eternal ruination of Gary Bowser in 2021</a> who will owe Nintendo $10 million for the rest of his life, and the company’s <a href="https://kotaku.com/nintendo-switch-piracy-lawsuit-mario-luigi-zelda-echoes-1851693898">attempts to get $7.5 million from Jess Keighin</a> last year, the Japanese behemoth is now going after Reddit moderator James “Archbox” Williams and asking for $4.5 million he won’t have. The idea, presumably, is to send shockwaves through piracy communities, given almost everyone who is targeted wouldn’t be able to pay for even Nintendo’s legal fees, let alone any money awarded.</p>

 <p>Meanwhile, sticking your fingers in your ears and hoping it will go away rarely proves to be an effective legal response, especially if you’ve no anonymity and evidence very convincingly suggests you committed the crimes. As OatmealDome stated on BlueSky, Nintendo is coming after James Williams for $4,500,000 in damages by “default judgment.”</p>   <h2>The Lost Cause</h2> <p>(Just for the sake of my colleagues, let me state right here that this article is&nbsp;<em>my</em> opinion, and not necessarily that of others at <em>Kotaku</em>. God knows, we disagree on a lot.)</p>

 <p>As is always the case in all of these proceedings, aside from the simple fact that illegally downloading something is…illegal, the idea that piracy costs a company significant losses is always stated as fact but is never asked to be proven or evidenced. Courts frequently take it on face value that any downloaded ROM must automatically represent a lost sale; something that’s never been demonstrated and <a href="https://draginol.joeuser.com/article/303512/Piracy_PC_Gaming">is clearly very spurious</a>, no matter how widely believed it may be. Ever since the days of Napster, corporations have been using “one download = one lost sale” to work out their claimed losses, which led to the gruesome spate of rulings in the early 2000s in which individuals were being bankrupted with ludicrous damages because their kids (who obviously wouldn’t have been able to afford to buy the music if they’d not pirated it, thus representing no lost sales at all) downloaded a bunch of mp3s. Nintendo continues with the same thinking <a href="https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.wawd.336727/gov.uscourts.wawd.336727.25.0.pdf">in its latest court filing</a>, stating,</p>

 <blockquote><p>“NOA has suffered damages as a result of these breaches, including but not limited to decreased profits and a loss of profits related to reproduction and distribution of the Nintendo Switch games and related to users whose accounts NOA has terminated for violation of the EULA.”</p></blockquote> <p>(I really do love the argument that Nintendo is suffering losses because it terminates people’s accounts.) It also goes on to claim that these losses are directly affecting employed individuals.</p> <blockquote><p>“These activities have substantially damaged NOA’s overall business and intellectual property rights, as well as the business and intellectual property rights of NOA’s development and publishing partners, and further has caused harm to the many artists, game designers, programmers and others whose livelihoods depend upon the sale of authorized Nintendo products.”</p></blockquote> <p>I find it quite extraordinary to declare that there has been harm to the livelihoods of specific employees without providing any evidence at all, instead relying on people’s feeling that piracy surely must cost a company money. It really behooves Nintendo to demonstrate any example of one of its own employed artists, designers, or programmers as having had their livelihoods affected, but it doesn’t attempt to and certainly never will. Claims like this are commonplace and pernicious, and I believe it’s crucial to at the very least ask for proof when they’re made. (It’s especially unpleasant at a time when we’re seeing companies reporting massive profits while sacking thousands of staff, making a mockery of the entire concept.)</p>

 <p>And please let me make clear: if you’re shouting at your screen, “<em>Of course game piracy causes significant losses and harms!</em>” all I am asking for is your evidence. Please demonstrate it, so I can agree with you. Of course it costs them <em>some</em> sales, it’s certainly not nothing, but nothing close to the ruinous amounts being claimed.</p>

 <h2>Expensive Speech</h2> <p>The case is unusual in that Williams is not only being sued for his making some manner of profit from allegedly charging for “pro” services, but primarily for “promoting” the piracy, directing Reddit users to his pages where Nintendo ROMs can be downloaded. This area of <em>encouraging</em> piracy is far more tricky in court, although historically that hasn’t been something judges have been particularly troubled by. The Nintendo filing repeatedly refers to <a href="https://www.billboard.com/music/music-news/case-summary-mgm-studios-vs-grokster-1410184/">2007’s Supreme Court ruling in the MGM versus Grokster case</a>, although that left a lot of ambiguity, and became overly focused on the technology rather than the principle. However, exploiting these issues would require Williams to be able to both afford a legal defense that could stand up to that of Nintendo’s, and—well—for him to acknowledge the situation at all.</p>

 <p>Nintendo usually reserves its ire for those who are actively profiting from piracy, charging for services or access to ROMs through so-called “Pirate Shops,” at which point the criminality is far more clear. That’s really not so much the case in this latest situation where the filing instead breaks down how Williams has promoted free Pirate Shops and given people information on how to circumvent the Switch’s anti-piracy measures. It does go on to allege that Archbox created “pro” versions of these offerings, exchanging access for “donations” of eShop cards, which far more immediately suggests tangible criminality, but this isn’t the emphasis.</p> <p>The filing, however, does lay out some extensive detective work, explaining why Nintendo believes Archbox has been involved at every stage of the piracy process, from being a member of the ROM dumping team to distributing circumvention software, then the creation of the distribution sites all the way to providing instructions for how to use them on Reddit and Discord. Again, Nintendo’s lawyers lay out how the “donation” schemes applied throughout, which potentially means the court won’t have to consider all the other claims and how they relate to free speech, or will more likely just handwave them through, given there’s evidence of profit.</p> <p>This is all made more damning for Archbox given his own responses, or lack thereof. Nintendo’s filing claims he initially “acknowledged his conduct violated NOA’s rights and stated he would work with NOA to satisfy its demands,” but that he denied involvement with the “Shops,” and then when Nintendo requested confirmation in writing that he’d comply with its demands, “he became combative and uncooperative.” Archbox rather pointlessly deleted his GitHub and took a few of the sites offline, but Nintendo says he left LiberaShop running throughout. Nintendo says that on May 17, 2024, it gave him “a final opportunity to comply with its demands prior to litigation,” and Williams responded saying an attorney would contact them. This never happened, and later, after some rather limited communication with a lawyer stating he represented Williams in early 2025, this, too, fell apart.</p>

 <h2>Damaging Figures</h2> <p>The rest of the filing goes on to argue for a default ruling, lists all of its allegations against Williams while making many more spurious claims about lost sales, then cites copyright and EULA violations, before finally reaching its rather loose justification for the $4.5 million figure: because someone did the same for Bungie. The figure itself just appears to have been plucked from the air, given the document states,</p> <blockquote><p>“Here, the amount of money sufficient to remedy NOA’s injury would be extremely difficult to quantify; but it is indisputable that such amount would be large. Therefore, the money at stake by this Motion is nowhere near an amount that would compensate NOA for the seriousness of Defendants’ conduct.”</p></blockquote> <p>For all the back-and-forth, there’s obviously no doubt that distributing ROMs and circumventing piracy measures is viewed as criminal. While there are unquestionably arguments to be made about the nature of the related rulings, it would require massive financial backing to successfully argue any of this in courts, and not within the purview of Nintendo’s targets. Meanwhile, it’s essential to take on board that Nintendo does appear to give these people the chance to agree to cease and desist, although the exact terms are unclear, and only resorts to litigation after that’s refused.</p>

 <h2>No Mercy</h2> <p>For me, the larger issue is the nature of the punishments, which seem to defy any notion of mercy. From my scant understanding of the situation, James “Archbox” Williams seems like a fool, an allegedly leading figure in an action known to be against the law who was given a chance to get out of this situation and refused to take it. However, no matter the individual, a way to make amends is an essential part of a judicial system. Criminals are supposed to be able to “pay their debt to society,” and rehabilitation should be central to consequences. Financial debt of the magnitude Nintendo demands from individuals is obviously impossible to ever pay back, and means a permanent, life-long punishment for a crime that—given the nature of offenses for which people are routinely sentenced to years in prison, or the meaningless financial penalties given to vast corporations for their deadly negligence—is relatively minor.</p> <p>Famously, <a href="https://kotaku.com/nintendo-gary-bowser-hacking-case-legal-jail-xecuter-1850346297">Gary Bowser will have to give between 25 and 30 percent of his income to Nintendo for the rest of his life</a>, and given that his time spent in prison makes it far harder for him to get well-compensated employment, this will likely leave him in dire straits until he dies. There’s no opportunity for reform here, no way to “pay his debt” either literally or metaphorically, and the same is true for every other individual pursued in this way.</p> <p>But so long as courts allow “one download = one lost sale” to continue to be accepted without asking for any evidence at all, and let through claims that employees’ livelihoods are harmed without demanding a single example, Nintendo will continue to chase such outrageous financial penalties in its furious (and ultimately futile) pursuits. “If you can’t do the time, don’t do the crime” might be a popular (if ignorant) refrain, but when the crime is copying video games, and the time is eternity, perhaps something is dreadfully amiss.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/playstation-concert-last-us-god-war-horizon-ghost-1851784665"><span>PlayStation: The Concert</span></a><span>, an orchestral show featuring music from games such as </span><i><span>The Last of Us</span></i><span>, </span><i><span>God of War</span></i><span>, and more, was scheduled to begin the American leg of its tour this week with a show at Williamsport’s Community Arts Center. However, it seems like the tour might be collapsing in on itself days before the first show, as Sony has started canceling performances without explanation.</span></p> <p><span>The show’s </span><a href="https://www.ticketmaster.com/playstation-the-concert-tickets/artist/3244629"><span>Ticketmaster page</span></a><span> (thanks, </span><a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/playstation-quietly-cancels-remaining-playstation-the-concert-2025-tour-dates-in-the-us/"><i><span>VGC</span></i></a><span>) lists several of its remaining 2025 shows as canceled, with tickets for only a few still for sale. To some extent, this isn’t much of a surprise, as the concert series had already canceled </span><a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/playstation-the-concert-is-reportedly-cancelling-numerous-tour-dates-and-delaying-others/"><span>several of its UK shows earlier this year</span></a><span> and pushed them to next summer. Right now, it looks like most of the US cancellations are just that, rather than postponements to another date. I checked some of the listings that have yet to be officially canceled on the site, but I was still met with an error message saying tickets were no longer available on Ticketmaster. At the moment, the concert’s 2026 dates remain largely untouched on Ticketmaster’s website.</span></p>

 <p><span>Sony has yet to explain the reasoning behind the cancellations, but we have reached out for comment and will update this story if we hear back. Some speculate that poor ticket sales may have played a part, as some attendees noted </span><a href="https://x.com/Hazzehh/status/1914836561402744976"><span>a lot of empty seats at their shows</span></a><span>, though other performances </span><a href="https://bsky.app/profile/magictreehouse.bsky.social/post/3lnj7g35t7s2x"><span>look pretty packed</span></a><span>. I wouldn’t be surprised if, even with the PlayStation branding, the show wasn’t drawing a lot of people in because it seemed very fixated on the PlayStation 4 and 5 era, spotlighting games like </span><i><span>The Last of Us</span></i><span>, </span><i><span>God of War</span></i><span>, </span><i><span>Horizon</span></i><span>, and </span><i><span>Ghost of Tsushima</span></i><span>, rather than making a show that encompassed a wide spread of the brand’s history. I feel like a dedicated show for any of those franchises would have pulled in crowds, but when you put them all under one umbrella and the whole thing seems like an ahistorical account of PlayStation history, I can see why people might not be flocking to buy tickets. It also doesn’t help that Sony didn’t have a huge marketing push behind the tour. I frankly forgot that it was coming up, and I was supposed to go to the Madison Square Garden show.</span></p>

 <p><strong>Update, 10/6/25 at 11:45 a.m.:&nbsp;</strong></p> <p>GEA Live, the company behind the PlayStation Concert, has released the following statement to&nbsp;<em>Kotaku</em>:</p> <blockquote> <p>It is with great regret that we have cancelled the PlayStation | The Concert tour in North America. Our team has spent a considerable amount of time developing this project, and we share in the disappointment of fans who will no longer be able to attend. We extend our heartfelt thanks to everyone who supported the show and appreciate your understanding in making this difficult decision.</p> </blockquote> <p>Though the initial statement reads as if the rest of the North American tour has been canceled, GEA Live representatives clarified in a follow-up statement that it specifically refers to the 2025 dates.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/call-of-duty-cod-black-ops-blops7-beta-doors-ttk-2000632082</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/black-ops-7%E2%80%99s-beta-has-players-complaining-about-matchmaking-and-doors.1317613/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Oh hey, a new <i>Call of Duty </i>is on the horizon. This time it’s <i>Black Ops</i> season (even though we just had one of those), and to help them fine-tune its competitive action and the overall ebb and flow of its speedy combat (as well as to test the game’s anti-cheat tech), developers Treyarch and Raven Software ran a beta for those with an active pre-order over the weekend.</p> <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/cod-next-blops-7-wall-bounce-maps-tac-movement-2000630271"><i>BLOPS7</i> aims to be a very fast</a>, bouncy shooter of a game, with players granted the ability to jump off walls much like they could in <i>Titanfall</i>. It looked super fun in motion during the multiplayer reveal last week, but now that folks have finally been able to pour into the lobbies and get some matches in, how did it all work out?</p>

 <p><b>Read More:</b> <a href="https://kotaku.com/cod-next-blops-7-wall-bounce-maps-tac-movement-2000630271"><i>Call Of Duty: Black Ops 7</i> Shows Off Everything Coming To Multiplayer At Launch</a></p> <p>TL;DR: The community is really upset over doors; TTK rates might be a touch too high; no one will ever be satisfied with SBMM; and <i>Battlefield</i> threatens to eat <i>COD</i>’s lunch for the first time in a long while.</p>

 <h2>Cheaters got the boot (most of ‘em, anyway)</h2> <p>This weekend’s beta was a perfect opportunity for <i>Call of Duty</i>’s anti-cheat initiative, <a href="https://kotaku.com/call-of-duty-beta-cheaters-cod-blops-black-ops-7-ban-secure-boot-ricochet-2000630268">Team Ricochet</a>, to test out their defenses. And from the sounds of things, cheaters had a hard time getting into matches. TMP 2.0, along with whatever other magic Team Ricochet is using to block cheaters, <a href="https://x.com/CODUpdates/article/1974942752485077132">appears to have caught 97 percent</a> of cheaters “within 30 minutes of their first sign-in,” with “fewer than one-percent of cheating attempts reach[ing] a match, and those that did were removed within minutes.”</p>

 <h2>SBMM, the eternal debate</h2> <p>Discourse over skill-based matchmaking (SBMM) was at the heart of last weekend’s beta, with a mode that specifically sought to avoid this controversial form of matchmaking. SBMM aims to make sure you’re matched with other random players of similar skill level. Sounds good in theory, but in practice it tends to be a bit of a tricky situation, especially if you’re playing with a friend who’s of a different skill level than you, resulting in unfair pairings. It can also make games feel more competitive and sweaty when some folks are just looking for a chill set of rounds.</p>

   <p>The debate over SBMM is sure to rage on, but Treyarch and Raven seem to be aware that not everyone’s a fan. During the beta, “<a href="https://www.callofduty.com/patchnotes/2025/10/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-beta-patch-notes#oct4">Open Moshpit” was introduced</a> to let folks jump into matches where “skill consideration is drastically reduced.”</p>

 <h2>Time-to-kill rates and those frakin’ doors!</h2> <p>Time-to-kill (TTK), the average amount of time it takes a player to die while being shot, would appear to be pretty speedy in <i>BLOPS7</i>. Perhaps too speedy. <a href="https://www.callofduty.com/patchnotes/2025/10/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-beta-patch-notes#oct3">The devs are aware</a> that folks are finding they die a bit too quickly right now, and so they’ll be “releasing a weapon balance patch in the coming days to adjust TTK and ensure all weapons available in the beta are competitive.”</p>

 <p>Quick deaths weren’t the only issue some folks had. Doors, it would seem, really got under some players’ skin. Though doors in <i>BLOPS7</i> maps are automatic (they can be shot to open them too), they don’t stay open, and the interruption of sightlines and the unwelcome surprise of running into someone you didn’t expect runs counter to the flow of gameplay many folks expect from <i>COD</i>. (Previous games saw doors stay open during a match.)</p>  <p>There aren’t too many doors, however. Treyarch reports that just five of its 16v16 maps currently have them. Still, the team is looking to possibly reduce that number, with an option to disable them in private matches.</p> <h2>The <i>Battlefield</i>-sized elephant in the room</h2> <p>As <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/call-of-duty/the-black-ops-7-beta-introduced-a-mode-without-sbmm-and-call-of-duty-players-are-psyched-we-need-battlefield-6-to-come-out-every-year/">reported by <i>GamesRadar</i></a>, the upcoming <i>Battlefield 6</i>, which is shaping up to be somewhat of a return-to-form for the beleaguered military shooter franchise, seems to be spooking Treyarch and Activision a bit. That the devs even considered removing SBMM via Open Mosphit, according to some, is proof that <i>COD</i>’s gonna do whatever it takes to try and offer an alternative to the allure of <i>Battlefield</i>.</p> <p>At the very least, it should be entertaining to see where this arms race between <i>Battlefield</i> and <i>COD</i> will go as we near the release of both games. <i>Battlefield 6</i> arrives on October 10, 2025, with <i>Black Ops 7</i> following it a month later on November 14.</p>
                          </div></div><br/><br/>https://kotaku.com/call-of-duty-cod-black-ops-blops7-beta-doors-ttk-2000632082]]></content:encoded>
