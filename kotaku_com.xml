The repair experts—who champion repairability, sustainability, and quality—didn’t mince words about Nintendo’s new and expensive controller. </p><p>For example, it’s “absurdly” difficult to replace the controller’s built-in battery, which will eventually fail—like all batteries—and will need to be replaced. To do so, you have to do all of this: </p><blockquote data-type="BlockQuote"><p>Remove the top plastic face plate held down by tons of adhesive to reach seven screws. Then remove finicky plastic wedge sections. Then, using more force than expected, yank off the two thumbsticks. Next, remove more screws. Then remove another plastic covering. After that, remove the bumpers. Then take out more screws and disconnect the rumble packs. Finally, remove a few more hidden screws, and now you can remove the internal guts of the controller and reach the battery pack.</p></blockquote><p>Yeah, that’s a lot of work to simply replace a permanently dead battery. And to reassemble the controller, you have to source your own adhesive to reinstall the front plate properly, or it will rattle while gaming. </p><p>And it gets <em>worse</em>. To remove the joysticks completely is a “pain in the ass” and requires more digging into the controller’s guts. And what iFixit found in there is alarming: some very low-profile joysticks that are prone to drifting. What’s more, the sticks appear to be using the same components found in the cheaper Joy Cons. The only good thing iFixit had to say about the controller was how easy it is to replace the headset jack. </p><p>The company suggests gamers <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/nintendo-switch-2-best-controllers-wireless-wired-pro-1851784358&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/nintendo-switch-2-best-controllers-wireless-wired-pro-1851784358">buy third-party controllers</a></span> that contain easier-to-access batteries and better thumbsticks, like the Elves 2 Pro from Gulikit. “A cash grab riding high on the Nintendo brand” is how iFixit summed up the Pro Controller 2. And yeah, seems like it. While the controller feels great in your hands and has some nifty extra buttons, it seems it’s far from being “Pro” grade hardware. </p><p>&nbsp;.<br></p></div></div><br/><br/>https://kotaku.com/switch-2-pro-controller-piss-poor-stick-drift-ifixit-1851786109]]></content:encoded>

The tribute to the legendary film director was meant to add a vintage aesthetic and heightened gravity to the samurai adventure’s panoramic vistas and cinematic showdowns, to varying levels of success. To be honest, I don’t think it worked that well.

The lo-fi beats mode was arranged by <em>Cowboy Bebop </em>and <em>Samurai Champloo </em>director Shinichirō Watanabe. Based on the brief preview, it sounds not unlike what you might get streaming a lo-fi beats playlist on the PS5 Spotify app in the background while playing the game. This one just happens to be incorporated directly into it, and with Watanabe’s input will hopefully include some unique tracks that complement the open world exploration and fighting taking place on screen during them. </p><p>It’s another gimmick, sure, but unlike the Kurosawa mode, it’s not being used as a visual shorthand to impart unearned meanings and depth to the game’s world, characters, and story. Instead, it’s a nod to the way people actually play big open world games full of backtracking and side content. For every dramatic scene, emotional relationship, or thematically rich detail, there are hours, sometimes dozens, spent doing fun, weird, and extremely repetitive gamer shit. While immersive environments and organic exploration are part of the appeal of the open world genre, so too is the <em>PowerWash Simulator</em>-like serenity and satisfaction of methodically cleaning up every enemy camp and collectible icon on the map. </p><p>Lots of people already listen to other stuff while doing this busywork. Sometimes it’s turning the game’s soundtrack off and putting on other music. Sometimes it’s catching up on five-hour-long podcasts. Some people even watch other shows and movies entirely during these activities. Sony designed an entire $200 accessory exactly for this purpose called the <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/playstation-portal-the-kotaku-review-1851015770&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/playstation-portal-the-kotaku-review-1851015770">PlayStation Portal</a></span>. It sold unexpectedly well. The lo-fi beats mode doesn’t just accept this, it embraces it by trying to add<em> Ghost of Yotei</em>’s own bespoke take on the practice. </p><p>This is basically how radio stations function in the <em>Grand Theft Auto</em> series. Zipping around Rockstar’s cities would be completely different without the deep catalog of licensed tunes players can flip through while getting to the next mission marker or dodging the cops. More games deserve them, whether they make fictional sense or not. Who knows if <em>Yotei</em>’s lo-fi beats mode will be as good. Fans are hoping for <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2wK27xW4OFI&amp;list=RD2wK27xW4OFI&amp;start_radio=1&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2wK27xW4OFI&amp;list=RD2wK27xW4OFI&amp;start_radio=1" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">at least one Nujabes track</a></span>, among others. But it’s a worthwhile acknowledgement of the way people actually engage with games.</p><p> .<br></p></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://kotaku.com/ghost-yotei-tsushima-2-cowboy-bebop-lofi-1851786114]]></content:encoded>

It’s not often I get to put on that old hat for this job, but watching professional musicians react in real time to some of the bonkers compositional choices Fox makes in <em>Deltarune</em>’s soundtrack has been a marriage of two of my passions. The first time I heard “<span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7f1RK1m7qvc&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7f1RK1m7qvc" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Third Sanctuary,”</a></span> one of the incredible tracks from <em>Deltarune</em>’s latest chapters, was when a video of game music cover band <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4GzU4BlZcS8&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4GzU4BlZcS8" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Lame Genie’s</a></span> drummer, Kyle Sawaia, blind reacting to its odd, shifting time signature, crossed my For You page.</p><p>First off, props to Sawaia for keeping up with those time signature changes on the fly. Second, Fox’s compositions didn’t need to go that hard, and yet he did it anyway. I still don’t really know the context for when this track plays, but it is not only a compositional feat; it also evokes a frantic, emotional battle between two tragically opposing forces. Is that what’s happening when you hear the song in-game? I have no idea, but hearing it out of context only made me want to boot up the game more to find out.</p><p>Lame Genie isn’t the only group of musicians in awe of “The Third Sanctuary” and the rest of <em>Deltarune</em>’s incredible soundtrack. Dozens of reactions from musicians have been sprouting up on TikTok and YouTube.</p><p>I’m the type of person who can listen to a song hundreds (if not thousands) of times on loop without getting tired of it, but eventually you do lose that initial awe you feel when you hear something for the first time. Watching others experience something is about as close as I get to feeling that again, which is why I’ve started watching more reaction videos to music and other media. In cases like <em>Deltarune</em>, musicians reacting to it drew my attention to something I hadn’t really been paying attention to. Most of my exposure to Fox’s music has been through his work on the <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTj1v1sAYXQ&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTj1v1sAYXQ" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>Pokémon </em>franchise</a></span>, but it’s nice to be reminded that he’s cooking when he’s working on his own stuff, too.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://kotaku.com/deltarune-ost-soundtrack-music-third-sanctuary-reaction-1851786110]]></content:encoded>
