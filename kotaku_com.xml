But, because these oddball broadcasts use digital avatars to recreate the actual sporting event, they do provide people with a real-time way to watch said event without actually showing any footage of it.

I’m not entirely sure why all the avatars have such large heads and the balls are so big, perhaps it’s to make it all seem more video-game-y and thus you won’t mind so much when stuff breaks, or maybe it’s just to make it easier to follow. </p><p>Either way, I’ve watched more tennis today than I have in a long time, so it also has the added bonus of making some non-tennis fans like me more likely to watch some of the sport. </p><p>You can find all the digital matches online here on the Australian Open’s <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.youtube.com/@australianopen/streams&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.youtube.com/@australianopen/streams" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">YouTube channel under the “Live” Tab.</a></span> Enjoy watching digital people play tennis, and make sure to read the comments in which random tennis fans arrive to watch a match and discover this bizarre video game simulation instead. </p><figure id="" data-id="4b468d5d4c2c54803cc65a63463be458" data-recommend-id="image://4b468d5d4c2c54803cc65a63463be458" data-format="png" data-width="407" data-height="64" data-lightbox="true" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Kotaku / YouTube</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="4b468d5d4c2c54803cc65a63463be458" data-recommend-id="image://4b468d5d4c2c54803cc65a63463be458" data-format="png" data-width="407" data-height="64" data-lightbox="true" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><figure id="" data-id="ca9feddad2da658fe5241a273228dbf2" data-recommend-id="image://ca9feddad2da658fe5241a273228dbf2" data-format="png" data-width="402" data-height="53" data-lightbox="true" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Kotaku / YouTube</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="ca9feddad2da658fe5241a273228dbf2" data-recommend-id="image://ca9feddad2da658fe5241a273228dbf2" data-format="png" data-width="402" data-height="53" data-lightbox="true" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><figure id="" data-id="d87d8f2e0773e13786b3b0d2049df254" data-recommend-id="image://d87d8f2e0773e13786b3b0d2049df254" data-format="png" data-width="404" data-height="66" data-lightbox="true" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Kotaku / YouTube</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="d87d8f2e0773e13786b3b0d2049df254" data-recommend-id="image://d87d8f2e0773e13786b3b0d2049df254" data-format="png" data-width="404" data-height="66" data-lightbox="true" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

And when it comes to pinnacle content, players will now get up to six respawn attempts when fighting the Arbiter of Ash boss, depending on the difficulty level. A number of enemies like Silverfist Commander, Plaguebearers, and Lost Men Zealots are getting reworked to feel more fair as well.</p><p>“Now, we have a huge amount of much more meta-shifting changes that we know we want to make, and one of the best things about having the game in Early Access with the endgame is that we now have a much better idea of where we want character power to be and what the balance of bosses and monsters should be relative to that,” game director  Jonathan Rogers told fans over the weekend. “But those types of changes are going to have to wait until we are ready to make a new league with a new economy for people to play in.”</p><p>A league in <em>Path of Exiles</em> is like a season in <em>Diablo</em>, and with the game having just arrived in early access on Steam and console in December, it’s possible the game’s bigger overhaul won’t arrive until closer to the end of winter. Rogers said the team at Grinding Gear Games wanted to get these more immediate tweaks out into players’ hands before prepping the more major stuff for release.</p><p><em>Path of Exile 2</em> will go free-to-play like its predecessor once it releases in full, but for now it’s $30 to try. That barrier to entry has barely phased players on Steam, though. The multiplayer RPG about beating back the darkness is still one of the Valve-owned storefront’s top-five best-selling and most-played games a month after launching. </p><p>.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

While some might believe you can just out-damage an enemy team to victory, if they have someone healing their team and providing utility beyond making numbers go up or down, they’re more than likely going to outplay you. That’s certainly the case in <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/marvel-rivals-review-hero-shooter-overwatch-netease-1851717975&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/marvel-rivals-review-hero-shooter-overwatch-netease-1851717975"><em>Marvel Rivals</em></a></span>, and thankfully its roster of supportive Strategist characters is pretty varied and has a myriad of playstyles to choose from. But who are the best and worst ones in NetEase’s hero shooter right now? Let’s find out as we rank them from the weakest link to the best in the business of healing.</p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="e7cd2cee155a657cb9c7d3db1e2a6b02" data-recommend-id="image://e7cd2cee155a657cb9c7d3db1e2a6b02" data-format="png" data-width="1368" data-height="769" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Loki looks at the camera while holding his staff." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Loki looks at the camera while holding his staff." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Marvel</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="e7cd2cee155a657cb9c7d3db1e2a6b02" data-recommend-id="image://e7cd2cee155a657cb9c7d3db1e2a6b02" data-format="png" data-width="1368" data-height="769" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Loki looks at the camera while holding his staff." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Far be it from me to tell the trickster god he’s got too many tricks in his kit, but Loki has a lot going on in his moveset and it makes him harder to nail down than most Strategists in <em>Marvel Rivals</em>. In the right hands, Loki is a diabolical menace of survivability and trickery, but his effectiveness feels very much determined by the specific situations in which he finds himself. His ultimate, which allows him to transform into another character on the field and use their ultimate ability, is a fun gimmick and may give you the opportunity to pull off a clutch play, but it’s so dependent on who’s around that it can make him less reliable than other heroes on the roster. Loki can keep your team alive against otherwise devastating attacks and play tricks on your foes as he creeps around undetected and pops to different locations, but I have a hard time imagining most players telling someone to switch to Loki because the current team comp isn’t working.</p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="94621bfcf8680f0d13ebb107b8ce6129" data-recommend-id="image://94621bfcf8680f0d13ebb107b8ce6129" data-format="png" data-width="1368" data-height="769" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Rocket leans on his gun." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Rocket leans on his gun." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Marvel</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="94621bfcf8680f0d13ebb107b8ce6129" data-recommend-id="image://94621bfcf8680f0d13ebb107b8ce6129" data-format="png" data-width="1368" data-height="769" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Rocket leans on his gun." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>The Guardians of the Galaxy’s feisty furball is one of the most fun Strategists to play in <em>Marvel Rivals</em>, even if his actual utility is a bit unremarkable. He’s super mobile when climbing up walls and flying around on his jetpack. His team-up with Groot is a blast to use as he rides on the sentient tree’s back and pumps out heals, essentially making the two unstoppable. And who could forget the most useful gadget in his arsenal: the team-reviving B.R.B. machine that basically gives a teammate a second life? But while Rocket is a lot of fun to play, he’s not the most efficient healer and his power-boosting ultimate is easily destroyed. I love Rocket, he’s my main Strategist. But there are better healers on the roster.</p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="dde623dd70ffabac7cc6565de89860c6" data-recommend-id="image://dde623dd70ffabac7cc6565de89860c6" data-format="png" data-width="1368" data-height="769" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Jeff makes a silly little face because he's a silly little guy." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Jeff makes a silly little face because he's a silly little guy." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Marvel</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="dde623dd70ffabac7cc6565de89860c6" data-recommend-id="image://dde623dd70ffabac7cc6565de89860c6" data-format="png" data-width="1368" data-height="769" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Jeff makes a silly little face because he's a silly little guy." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p><em>Marvel Rivals</em>’ most mischievous little guy’s not the most efficient healer, but there’s a reason he’s <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/marvel-rivals-jeff-the-land-shark-ultimate-ability-1851716962&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/marvel-rivals-jeff-the-land-shark-ultimate-ability-1851716962">a pest an enemy team hates to see coming</a></span>. He’s incredibly mobile, can ride on Groot’s back, and his healing bubbles allow him to disperse support without having to be up the team’s ass at all times. Best of all, his ultimate is the kind of thing that can flip a fight with minimal effort. Swallowing up entire teams to spit them off the map or just pulling them away from an objective is a quick and efficient way to completely shift a game. Players are starting to learn ways to counter him, but sending an entire team tumbling down into a chasm is still one of the most reliable strategies in <em>Marvel Rivals</em>.</p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="89fb01d6bbf46ebe8263781e322a61d3" data-recommend-id="image://89fb01d6bbf46ebe8263781e322a61d3" data-format="png" data-width="1368" data-height="769" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Adam Warlock holds his hand out toward the screen." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Adam Warlock holds his hand out toward the screen." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Marvel</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="89fb01d6bbf46ebe8263781e322a61d3" data-recommend-id="image://89fb01d6bbf46ebe8263781e322a61d3" data-format="png" data-width="1368" data-height="769" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Adam Warlock holds his hand out toward the screen." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Marvel’s “perfect specimen” has a pretty unique kit that offers an interesting approach to the support archetype. He’s got decent heals, excellent damage, and an ultimate that can revive an entire wiped team. Perhaps most interesting of all, his novel approach to survivability has him evenly distributing incoming damage across multiple characters. Like Loki, he’s a bit more complex than some Strategists and can easily prove useless to an inexperienced player, but a skilled one can get an insane amount of value out of his kit.</p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="be5c87f9e40e8c3639cce59161bbaf0e" data-recommend-id="image://be5c87f9e40e8c3639cce59161bbaf0e" data-format="png" data-width="2048" data-height="1152" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Invisible Woman stands with her arms by her side." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Invisible Woman stands with her arms by her side." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Marvel</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="be5c87f9e40e8c3639cce59161bbaf0e" data-recommend-id="image://be5c87f9e40e8c3639cce59161bbaf0e" data-format="png" data-width="2048" data-height="1152" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Invisible Woman stands with her arms by her side." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Sue Storm is <em>Marvel Rivals</em>’ newest Strategist and the latest to fall into an odd archetype of “women who throw light blobs at enemies.” At least her invisibility and shields make her distinguishable from others in the same box. Invisible Woman’s support comes in the form of not just heals but protection, with her shields radiating healing energy as they defend teammates from incoming fire. She can also use them to push and pull enemies around, making her great for plays that make use of the environment like pushing foes off a map. Her cloaking abilities are versatile, allowing her to both escape difficult situations and set up for an ambush. And her ultimate marries all of the above to create a powerful healing barrier that hides characters inside from incoming damage or heals. Sure, you can blindly fire within her ultimate, but you’re wasting time and bullets if you can’t actually see what’s inside. It also has some incredible combo potential, such as a Scarlet Witch preparing her explosive ultimate inside it, keeping enemies on the outside from seeing her and running for cover. Players are still getting the hang of her, as she’s only been in the game since Season 1 began on January 10, but even in those few short days she’s shown a lot of potential.</p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="aa39bdf4b2ece26d0465228d210ef4f9" data-recommend-id="image://aa39bdf4b2ece26d0465228d210ef4f9" data-format="png" data-width="1403" data-height="788" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Cloak and Dagger reach out toward the screen in a cool action pose." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Cloak and Dagger reach out toward the screen in a cool action pose." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Marvel</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="aa39bdf4b2ece26d0465228d210ef4f9" data-recommend-id="image://aa39bdf4b2ece26d0465228d210ef4f9" data-format="png" data-width="1403" data-height="788" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Cloak and Dagger reach out toward the screen in a cool action pose." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Cloak &amp; Dagger has one of the most unique set-ups of any character in <em>Marvel Rivals</em>. The duo is able to freely swap between the supportive Dagger and Cloak the saboteur. The two’s duality is captured in every facet of their design, both visually and mechanically. Dagger’s dazzling as she rains down healing on a team while Cloak is enveloped in darkness and is able to blind enemies. They’re diametrically opposed characters in nearly every way, tied together by an unbreakable bond. You essentially have to master two playstyles and learn to manage each of their cooldowns to be an effective player, and skillfully swapping between the two at a moment’s notice can make the difference between a game-saving play or a quick defeat. By design they’re one of the most versatile picks in the game, and I hope they’re a sign that <em>Marvel Rivals</em> will continue to find innovative ways to fill out its roster.</p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="13a0d4c4bb84a686487292a69691fdd2" data-recommend-id="image://13a0d4c4bb84a686487292a69691fdd2" data-format="png" data-width="1368" data-height="769" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Mantis stands with her hand on her hip." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Mantis stands with her hand on her hip." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Marvel</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="13a0d4c4bb84a686487292a69691fdd2" data-recommend-id="image://13a0d4c4bb84a686487292a69691fdd2" data-format="png" data-width="1368" data-height="769" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Mantis stands with her hand on her hip." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>The Guardians of the Galaxy account for almost half of <em>Marvel Rivals</em>’ Strategists, but Mantis is far and away the standout among the three, and one of the most reliable picks in the game. Her utility is some of the best, allowing her to boost damage with her empathic abilities and hard crowd control foes by putting them to sleep, all with solid damage and healing output. On top of that, her ultimate is one of the best survival abilities in <em>Marvel Rivals</em>. She heals surrounding foes and converts that healing to overhealth almost immediately, giving her team a tool to push through fortified enemy teams with and helping them hold their ground against the deadliest onslaught of foes. Honestly, depending on the day, I could see Mantis being tied for the number-one spot with who our first-place winner. There just aren’t really any situations in which having a good Mantis on your team is a bad play.</p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="89c55ae02e7ad5ac1c56ed38a8c97d83" data-recommend-id="image://89c55ae02e7ad5ac1c56ed38a8c97d83" data-format="png" data-width="1368" data-height="769" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Luna Snow points at the camera with one of her knees raised as if she is dancing." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Luna Snow points at the camera with one of her knees raised as if she is dancing." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Marvel</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="89c55ae02e7ad5ac1c56ed38a8c97d83" data-recommend-id="image://89c55ae02e7ad5ac1c56ed38a8c97d83" data-format="png" data-width="1368" data-height="769" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Luna Snow points at the camera with one of her knees raised as if she is dancing." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p><em>Marvel Rivals</em>’ resident k-pop star is our pick for the hero shooter’s best strategist. Like Mantis, her kit has great healing and strong CC, and her ultimate is probably the most efficient healing ultimate in the game. It also has a slight edge on Mantis’ similar ult because of its versatility, with Luna being able to shift between near-insurmountable healing and devastating damage boosts that can help your team overcome just about anything. Some of my earliest memories of good team synergy in <em>Marvel Rivals </em>involved using Star-Lord’s ult over a dancing Luna Snow as she cranked up my damage output, deleting enemy teams in seconds. Luna Snow and Mantis have a lot of the same utility with different flavors, but the dancing queen just slightly comes out on top thanks to her excellent Team-up abilities, which give new tools to Namor and Jeff the Land Shark and allow her to wield Iron Fist’s Chi to keep enemies from getting too close. They’re both queens in their own right, though.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
