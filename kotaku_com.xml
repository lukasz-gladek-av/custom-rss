With that win, it became only the third FX show in the last 20 years to be bestowed such an honor, following the criminally underrated <em>The Americans </em>and <em>Nip/Tuck</em>. Tadanobu Asano’s stellar portrayal of disgraced and deceitful Kashigi Yabushige helped win the network its first-ever Golden Globe in the category of Best Supporting Actor – Series, Miniseries or Television Film. The show’s other wins were Sanada for Actor in a Drama TV Series, and Anna Sawai, who played Lady Mariko, for Actress in a Drama TV Series.</p><p>At the end of its first season, which was based on James Clavell’s 1975 novel of the same name, Toranaga had surreptitiously been treating people’s lives like chess pieces, keeping Blackthorne under his control by destroying his ship, and benefiting from Lady Mariko’s heartbreaking death after sending her into the lion’s den of Osaka where his rival Ishido Kazunari (Takehiro Hira) was awaiting his surrender. And he still hasn’t divulged the full extent of his plans, even with a major battle for ruler of Japan possibly on the horizon.</p><p>Safe to say that while season one more or less covered the entirety of James Clavell’s novel, there’s more than enough opportunity for the show’s writers to continue the story and create another award-winning year for one of the best shows of the 2020s.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

It wasn’t a huge hit compared to other <em>CoD </em>games, not least because the Vita itself wasn’t a big seller. But despite the Vita being a portable console from over a decade ago and<em> Black Ops: Declassified</em> being a oddball spin-off from 2012, there are still enough people playing the FPS in 2025 that you can reportedly boot up a Vita right now and find a match in seconds. </p><p>On January 4, PlayStation content creator Radec posted on Twitter that they were able to boot up a PS Vita and find matches “instantly” in <em>Call of Duty: Black Ops Declassified</em>. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://x.com/realradec/status/1875686080378499148&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://x.com/realradec/status/1875686080378499148" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The tweet went viral</a></span>, likely because a lot of people were surprised to hear that <em>Declassified</em> was still popular and being played in 2025. And I bet some people were just shocked to hear about a PS Vita <em>Call of Duty</em> even existing. </p><p>Radec isn’t the only person reporting this. In the replies to the tweet you can find other players sharing stories of how they just recently booted up the game on their own PS Vita and also found matches quickly. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://x.com/David_Jagneaux/status/1856836194526695884&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://x.com/David_Jagneaux/status/1856836194526695884" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Another player shared how they found matches quickly</a></span> in <em>Declassified </em>in November, saying it only took about 20 seconds to find a full lobby. </p><p>“Legit. Like last month I connected my Vita to my mobile hotspot and checked <em>Black Ops Declassified </em>multiplayer and there were almost full lobbies with all kinds of players,” <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://x.com/RicksterLPs/status/1875813935200530823&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://x.com/RicksterLPs/status/1875813935200530823" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">said another user in response to Radec’s tweet</a></span>. “The best part about the whole experience was there were no hackers. Just people who wanna unwind and play.”</p><p>Declassified isn’t the only old <em>CoD</em> game still being played in 2025. You can still boot up most <em>Call of Duty </em>games released on PS3, Xbox 360, Xbox One, and PS4 and find players instantly. Some people just don’t want to move on. Be warned though, as someone who has done this, the people still playing these older <em>Call of Duty</em> games are veterans who know the maps and weapons incredibly well and you’ll likely get stomped over and over. </p><p>&nbsp; .<br></p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

If they took any damage within that period, they’ll receive some partially healed health too. Overall, this ability is a great tool to increase their survival chances.</p><p>Psylocke arguably gets the better end of the bargain here as she’s slower than Black Panther and has 100 less health. Although her Psi-Blade Dash and Psychic Stealth can lead to a quick exit, she’s still in danger within big open areas. Magik’s Dimensional Shortcut provides a new way to escape sticky situations and maybe get some health back too.</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="5aa9264af9e7fc431e3fc020420d944e" data-recommend-id="image://5aa9264af9e7fc431e3fc020420d944e" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="A blue wave radiates off Luna Snow, healing her allies and knocking a couple of enemies away." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A blue wave radiates off Luna Snow, healing her allies and knocking a couple of enemies away." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Marvel Games / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="5aa9264af9e7fc431e3fc020420d944e" data-recommend-id="image://5aa9264af9e7fc431e3fc020420d944e" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="A blue wave radiates off Luna Snow, healing her allies and knocking a couple of enemies away." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>Luna Snow is a fun character to use, but you’re going to need good aim as her kit mostly revolves around healing and damaging projectile attacks.

Using it can make that MVP or SVP title a lot more attainable for a healer like Luna.</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="42fd3b6b8db04c115a7097c2e2a6140d" data-recommend-id="image://42fd3b6b8db04c115a7097c2e2a6140d" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Rocket Raccoon shoots at a Galacta Bot while riding Groot’s shoulder." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Rocket Raccoon shoots at a Galacta Bot while riding Groot’s shoulder." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Marvel Games / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="42fd3b6b8db04c115a7097c2e2a6140d" data-recommend-id="image://42fd3b6b8db04c115a7097c2e2a6140d" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Rocket Raccoon shoots at a Galacta Bot while riding Groot’s shoulder." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>Groot is a fun tanky character on his own, but for some of us it’s hard to imagine him without also thinking of a furry raccoon creature riding on his shoulder with a giant gun. The Planet X Pals Team-Up brings that imagery to life by allowing either Rocket Raccoon or Jeff The Land Shark to attach onto Groot’s shoulder. They can then attack from the position while enjoying a damage reduction.</p><p>Out of all the Team-Ups, this one lends itself to feeling the most symbiotic. Groot can help his smaller friends charge into battle more easily, with both picking off enemies as they go. At the same time, Groot’s passengers can provide easy heals straight from his shoulder. I highly encourage jumping onto your next tree man teammate if you want a more active role during combat.</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="3726d5b1a172aa56d9e86120927096e6" data-recommend-id="image://3726d5b1a172aa56d9e86120927096e6" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt=" Namor stares at a Frost Spawn he summoned, which is blue and has a cracked ice aura underneath it." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt=" Namor stares at a Frost Spawn he summoned, which is blue and has a cracked ice aura underneath it." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Marvel Games / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="3726d5b1a172aa56d9e86120927096e6" data-recommend-id="image://3726d5b1a172aa56d9e86120927096e6" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt=" Namor stares at a Frost Spawn he summoned, which is blue and has a cracked ice aura underneath it." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>Some heroes can be a part of multiple Team-Ups. Luna Snow can provide both Jeff the Land Shark and Namor with icy versions of an existing ability. The former temporarily modifies his Aqua Burst to slow enemies, while the latter gets a Frozen Spawn that can slow enemies.</p><p>Slowing down your targets is always a fantastic option given how hectic <em>Marvel Rivals</em> matches can get. Both characters play better with these additions, but Namor might edge out for some cooler applications. Just like his regular Monstro Spawn, his Frozen Spawn can also be enhanced. Giving him turrets that slow down enemies and can briefly increase their firing rate is a game-changer.</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="b7805b41c9aa5666c470bd49b1b9ae68" data-recommend-id="image://b7805b41c9aa5666c470bd49b1b9ae68" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt=" Black Widow aims at a group of blue afterimages left behind by a Galacta Bot." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt=" Black Widow aims at a group of blue afterimages left behind by a Galacta Bot." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Marvel Games / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="b7805b41c9aa5666c470bd49b1b9ae68" data-recommend-id="image://b7805b41c9aa5666c470bd49b1b9ae68" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt=" Black Widow aims at a group of blue afterimages left behind by a Galacta Bot." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>A Team-Up between two sniper characters is a deadly alliance.
