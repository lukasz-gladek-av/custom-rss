              <p>The Millennium Falcon has gotten a dark, evil makeover by LEGO, something we witnessed in LEGO Star Wars: Rebuild the Galaxy series. You can now bring this sinister piece home for less, thanks to a nice 17% discount on Amazon.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5792/">The offer brings the price of the The Dark Falcon Buildable Starship set to $149, making it much more approachable.</a> Grabbing it right now will ensure it arrives before Christmas, which is ideal if you’re planning to surprise a fan of the galaxy far, far away with it. All shoppers get to enjoy free delivery, which adds even more value to the purchase.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5792/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Incredible Attention to Detail</h2>
<p>The set is designed for ages 10 and up. A total of 1,579 pieces bring it together, which includes some minifigures, too (more on that later). Over 1500 pieces means it’s not exactly going to be a small, quick build. This is honestly a good thing because this way, you can spend cozy holiday evenings by the fireplace building it with loved ones while talking about Darth Vader’s shenanigans.</p>
<p>You will be building the dark version of the Millennium Falcon as seen in the Rebuild the Galaxy Disney+ special, which features a removable cockpit for 2 LEGO minifigures, 2 spring-loaded shooters, 2 rotating cannons, a gunner post for 2 LEGO minifigures, and a radar dish. Speaking of minifigures, these include Darth Jar Jar, Bounty Hunter C-3PO, Darth Dev, Darth Rey, Beach Luke, and Jedi Vader, plus their cute accessories, lightsabers, and a blue milk carton.</p>



<p>The exterior looks absolutely stunning and realistic, and the interior is just as impressive. You can flip the top panels to play with the details inside. Maybe place Darth Jar Jar on his throne, or help Jedi Vader rescue Beach Luke from the jail cell. There’s a command center, a hyperdrive, and an entertainment area as well. Once put together, this set measures over 5 in. (12 cm) high, 17 in. (43 cm) long, and 12.5 in. (32 cm) wide. It’s going to look incredible as a display piece on your bookshelf with Star Wars books, or even in the kids’ room. The set comes with a detailed instruction book that takes you through each step of the process one by one. It’s quite easy to follow, so if you’re planning to let your kids build in, they can do it without your supervision. LEGO also has its own Builder app, which offers interactive 3D instructions for an even better building experience.</p>
<p>This set is part of the LEGO Star Wars: Rebuild the Galaxy collection. If you’re looking to go all out this holiday season, you might also want to grab the 75388 Jedi Bob’s Starfighter and 75393 TIE Fighter &amp; X-Wing Mash-up sets, too. There are quite a few options going for less right now, so it’s a good time to create an entire setup without spending a ton. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5792/">As for this discount, it’s better to grab it sooner rather than later. Holiday rush is already in full swing, and deals are moving fast.</a> This one (like many others) is likely not going to be around for too long. Snap it while it’s still live.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/samsung-clears-out-g50d-odyssey-gaming-monitor-at-42-off-the-32%e2%80%b3-model-is-now-cheaper-than-the-27%e2%80%b3-2000653260</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Amazon is unloading its Samsung gaming monitors in a big way, with huge discounts for last-minute holiday shoppers. It’s working, too — supplies are dwindling so quickly that <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6186/">Amazon’s placed its big red “Deal Selling Fast” sign on this one that’s carving 42% from the price of the Samsung 32-Inch Odyssey G50D Series QHD Fast IPS gaming monitor</a>. The $250 price on a gaming monitor that’s considered a terrific deal at its full price of $430 is going go run out sooner than later, and it’s one you’d regret missing.</p>
<p>The Odyssey G50D is G-Sync compatible in addition to having AMD FreeSync built in, and it moves at a crisp 180Hz with a 1ms response time to keep you at peak performance in those fast action and shooter games. The QHD resolution delivers 1.7 times the pixel density of Full HD for amazing sharpness and color, and the VESA DisplayHDR 400 technology amps up the contrast levels to reveal details you’ve probably never noticed before in your favorite games.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6186/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Real-Time Action</h2>
<p>Nothing’s more frustrating than lag and delay when you’re in the middle of an action game or shooter. Pound that button as fast as you like, but if your monitor just a fraction of a second behind the action, you’re cooked. That’s why the 180Hz refresh rate and 1ms response time of the Odyssey G50D is so crucial. It keeps you completely on top of the action down to the microsecond and gives you a huge advantage over anyone who’s playing on a lesser screen.</p>
<p>The VESA DisplayHDR 400 tech is another valuable weapon in your arsenal. It gives you a field of view with deeper blacks and brighter whites, and an overall brighter, better look of the entire screen, so you can detect enemies lurking in the shadows, or snipe rivals from great distances that you would have missed entirely on your old monitor.</p>



<h2>Creature Comforts</h2>
<p>You might not immediately associate a gaming monitor with physical comfort, but when you’re able to make fine adjustments to the height and angle of your monitor to line it up precisely to where you’re seated, you’ll notice that your neck and shoulders aren’t barking at you nearly as quickly as before. The Odyssey G50D is able to swivel, tilt, and adjust to get exactly into your line of vision, and it also has Eye Saver Mode to minimize blue light and reduce flickering, thereby reducing eye strain and irritation. Settle into your gaming chair, get the Odyssey G50D lined up exactly where you want it, and prepare for a long, comfortable grind.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6186/">During this time-limited Amazon deal, the 32-inch model of the Samsung Odyssey G50D is $40 below the price of the 27-inch version</a>. That’s an invitation to swoop in and grab one, because it might be the last chance you get to grab a monitor of this size and quality for just $250.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/bose-quietcomfort-headphones-drop-53-off-as-this-limited-edition-color-is-cleared-out-before-christmas-2000653257</link>

              <p>We can officially consider it to be last-minute holiday shopping season now, and that’s when some truly epic deals sneak up on you. Here’s one of the best ones from the audio department at Amazon — <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6392/">the top-rated Bose QuietComfort wireless headphones are a limited-time steal at just $170</a>. These are among the very best wireless headphones for Active Noise Cancellation, and it goes without saying that the sound quality is absolutely peak, because they’re from Bose.</p>
<p>The Bose QC wireless headphones are backed by more than just the Bose name. They have over 15,000 Amazon reviews that clock in at an average of 4.5 stars, among the very best in the category. That elite-level Active Noise Cancellation, deep bass, and 24 hours of playtime on a single USB-C charge are big reasons for that lofty rating, but they’re hardly the only ones.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6392/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Amazingly Customizable</h2>
<p>The Bose app isn’t just a good way to work the controls on the QuietControl headphones. It’s also where you can find the Adjustable EQ that lets you play producer and take the controls to fine-tune your favorite music. Make tiny tweaks to the bass, treble, and mid-range to suit your personal tastes, and then save the settings to your profile. The Bose app is also the route to the latest firmware updates so you can ensure your QC headphones have all of the latest features and tech.</p>
<p>Some of that recent tech that makes the Bose QuietControl wireless headphoes such a great buy at half price at Amazon? How about multipoint Bluetooth connectivity so you don’t have to go through the disconnect-reconnect toggle every time you want to switch your headphones from your laptop to your smartphone or other device. There’s also the Aware Mode that works hand in hand with the legendarily good Quiet mode — switching to Aware mode keeps your sound at pro levels while reducing the level of noise cancellation to allow enough sound in for safety or conversations.</p>



<h2>Listen All Day Long</h2>
<p>The Bose QuietComfort headphone have a literal full-day battery life on a single USB-C charge — up to 24 hours so you can listen to your music, podcasts, or audio books as long as you like. If you forget to recharge them and find the battery level is low or even dead, a 15-minute quick charge will give you a 2.5-hour boost. Those lengthy listening sessions are also exceptionally comfortable, thanks to the exceptionally plush ear cushions and lightweight construction of the Bose QuietComfort headphones.</p>
<p>Of the 11 different color models of the Bose QuietComfort wireless headphones, only three are priced this low during this Amazon deal (Moonlight Grey, Pink, and Sandstone), so be sure you’re clicking the right one. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6392/">And do it quickly, because this $170 deal on a pro-level set of Bose wireless headphones is going, and going fast.&nbsp;</a></p>

            <title><![CDATA[Apple M4 MacBook Air Joins the Holiday Price War at an All-Time Low to Compete With Windows PC Deals]]></title>
            <link>https://kotaku.com/apple-m4-macbook-air-joins-the-holiday-price-war-at-an-all-time-low-to-compete-with-windows-pc-deals-2000653263</link>
            <guid>1383286</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Apple’s willingness to cut huge deals on their newest tech gear has been one of the biggest and most pleasant surprises of the 2025 holiday shopping season. It’s still not too late to cash in on this surprising new trend, if this latest Amazon deal is any indication. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6030/">The 2025 M4 MacBook Air is still just $749 at Amazon, its lowest price ever and a big $250 step down from its usual $999.</a></p>
<p>The M4 MacBooks are one of the best places to look for amazing deals since being supplanted at the top of the Apple ecosystem by the M5 chip last October. But the price drops on the M4 models go way beyond the step down from the M5 to the M4, because the M4 machines are still absolutely elite-level computers, loaded with Apple Intelligence, Apple’s industry-best Liquid Retina display, outstanding cameras and speakers, and enough memory and power for heavy-duty creative work.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6030/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>A Small Step Down</h2>
<p>The talk in techworld has been all about the M5 MacBooks since they debuted in October, and rightfully so. The M5 machines are industry-best laptops, so when we see a huge deal on an M4 model like this one, the question becomes, just how big is the difference? The M5 chip is a faster CPU by up to 20% and faster in terms of AI thanks to new integrated Neural Accelerators. Big numbers to be sure, but how noticeable to the everyday user? Answer: Not very, unless you’re completely immersed in exceptionally heavy AI work, and even then it’s an incremental difference.</p>
<p>So while there may be an M5 MacBook Air coming in the early months of 2026, it’s a fairly safe bet that the resulting price drop on this M4 model won’t go any lower than this Amazon deal for $749, and the performance difference won’t come near meeting the price difference. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6030/">The time to grab the M4 MacBook Air is now, during this last-minute holiday sale at Amazon.</a></p>



<h2>All the Bells, All the Whistles</h2>
<p>It’s been less than a year since the M4 MacBook Air dropped, so it has all of the perks and tech that make the MacBooks so coveted. The M4 chip itself has a 10-core CPU and up to 10 cores of GPU, with 16GB of unified memory and a 256GB SSD. It’s the ideal machine for photo and video editing and other content creation-related tasks. The 12MP Center Stage camera, four built-in speakers with Spatial Audio, and studio-quality mics make the MacBook Air the perfect video conferencing or video call laptop, along with its slim, lightweight design.</p>
<p>We’ve all been so used to a $749 MacBook either being 2 or 3 generations old or having the words “refurbished” or “scratch and dent” attached to the deal that the idea of that price being on a brand-new 2025 model is a little surreal. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6030/">But this Amazon deal taking $250 off of this 13-inch M4 MacBook Air is the real deal, and it’s real close to being real gone.&nbsp;</a></p>
