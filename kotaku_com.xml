              <p>Picking a new laptop isn’t easy these days. With endless options flooding the market, most of us tend to stick to reliable brands and Lenovo remains one of the few that never disappoints. Right now, one of its most complete models, the Lenovo <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5601/">IdeaPad Slim 3 with a 15.3‑inch FHD+ display, Intel Core i5 processor, 16GB DDR5 RAM and 512GB PCIe SSD, is down to an all‑time low of $549 from $2,499</a>, now 78% off.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5601/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Power, Speed, and Everyday Practicality</h2>
<p>The Lenovo IdeaPad Slim 3 is built for the kind of multitasking modern life demands. The <strong>13th‑gen Intel Core i5‑13420H chip delivers eight cores</strong> (four Performance + four Efficiency cores) and twelve threads which means you can run multiple professional apps, stream media, and browse with dozens of tabs open – all without slowdown. Its turbo frequency reaches 4.6 GHz, giving the extra power burst needed for quick data crunchingor content creation sessions.</p>
<p>Storage also gets a serious boost thanks to the 512 GB PCIe SSD: That’s enough space for a full library of files, photos and software, while keeping boot and loading times near‑instant. It’s the kind of performance jump that makes going back to a traditional hard drive nearly impossible. You only need to lift the lid and the system wakes instantly, ready for work or play.</p>



<p>Then there’s the display: a <strong>15.3‑inch WUXGA panel (1920 × 1200) with a 16:10 aspect ratio for extra vertical room</strong>. It’s crisp, bright at 300 nits, and features an anti‑glare coating that keeps reflections minimal even under strong lighting. The narrow bezels make the entire setup look modern, while the 45 percent NTSC color coverage produces consistent tones for everyday use. Whether you’re streaming shows or reviewing presentations, the wide‑angle IPS screen ensures what you see is both vibrant and fatigue‑free.</p>
<p>The IdeaPad Slim 3 features Wi‑Fi 6 for faster and more reliable wireless performance and Bluetooth 5.2 for low‑latency peripheral pairing. Its generous port selection makes life easier: two USB‑A ports, one USB‑C with Power Delivery and DisplayPort support, an HDMI output, a 3.5 mm audio jack, an SD card reader, and of course the power connector. That means no annoying dongle juggling when you want to plug in a mouse, transfer photos or connect to an external monitor.</p>



<p>This 15‑inch Lenovo is slimmer than the previous generation by around 10%. At roughly 4 pounds, it strikes the right balance between portability and sturdiness. The hinge feels solid but light enough to open with one hand, and the full‑size keyboard with number pad makes typing comfortable even during long sessions of data entry or writing. Lenovo always manages to hit that sweet spot between form and function and this one’s a perfect example.</p>
<p>Daily usability shines through small, thoughtful touches like efficient cooling that keeps fan noise low and the Copilot key on the keyboard, giving instant access to Microsoft’s AI assistant. That’s a rare feature for a laptop in this price category, and it aligns perfectly with the growing shift toward AI‑enhanced productivity.</p>
<p>Whether you’re browsing the web, managing spreadsheets or taking Zoom calls, the IdeaPad Slim 3 stays responsive and cool through it all. Its battery performance comfortably lasts through a full workday with light productivity mixed with streaming. Pair that with <strong>fast charging and you’re back to 50% in roughly 30 minutes</strong> using any modern USB‑C charger.</p>
<p>If you’ve been looking for a reliable daily driver, the IdeaPad Slim 3 is about as balanced as it gets. Amazon discounts come and go but this one feels special.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/this-pair-of-magnetic-wireless-chargers-costs-peanuts-now-cheaper-than-an-apple-charging-cable-2000644584</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/this-pair-of-magnetic-wireless-chargers-costs-peanuts-now-cheaper-than-an-apple-charging-cable.1354663/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Owning a MagSafe compatible charger is one of those small luxuries that makes daily life feel smooth: no cables, no fumbling, just drop your phone and watch it charge. The only catch? Normally, buying a single official one costs almost as much as a wired charger and cable combined. But this early Black Friday deal flips that logic upside down. Right now on Amazon, <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5600/">the Anker Zolo magnetic wireless charger 2-pack is selling for just $25, down from $39</a>. That’s <strong>cheaper than what Apple charges for a single USB-C cable</strong>, and you’re getting two fast wireless pads that work brilliantly with the latest iPhones and AirPods.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5600/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Fast, Cool Convenient Charging for Daily Use</h2>
<p>Magnetic chargers have become a staple among iPhone owners due to the ease they deliver. Instead of searching behind the nightstand for your cable, you just snap your phone onto the charging pad, and it locks in place every time. The Anker Zolo pads use <strong>Qi2 certified technology to deliver up to 15 watts of fast charging</strong> which is sufficient to bring an iPhone 17 Pro Max up to 20 percent in just 19 minutes when combined with a 20W or higher wall adapter.</p>



<p>What makes this a great everyday charger is the smart protection system inside. Anker’s ActiveShield 2.0 monitors<strong> temperature levels more than 8 million times a day</strong>, and automatically adjusts power flow to prevent overheating. That means your phone or earbuds stay cool even during overnight charging, while the battery’s long‑term health remains protected. It’s the kind of detail most people never think about, but it’s crucial if you charge your phone daily and want it to still perform like new next year.</p>



<p>Each pad comes with a <strong>5‑foot cable</strong>&nbsp;which is much longer than most standard chargers-giving you more freedom to move your phone while it’s powering up. You can easily FaceTime, scroll, or stream with the cable stretched comfortably across your couch or desktop, sans that tight, awkward pull that short cords create. If you’ve ever tried texting while your phone’s plugged into a short 3‑foot charger, you know the difference those extra inches make.</p>
<p>The compact form factor makes these chargers great for travel, too. They fit easily into a laptop sleeve or small pouch and come with a handy cable tie that keeps everything neat. Toss one in your backpack for the office and leave the other on your nightstand-no need to keep reconnecting cables or worrying about frayed connectors. The simplicity of dropping your phone on the pad and walking away quickly becomes addictive.</p>



<p>While each Anker Zolo pad works well enough on its own as a charger, and gets two in one set makes it feel like an instant home upgrade. Keep one beside your bed and one on your desk, or place them side by side for family use so that there’s always one handy. Even if you never give much thought to chargers, this deal is of the sort you’ll be appreciative of daily: a little convenience that makes life with technology smoother in subtle ways.</p>
<p>What’s also impressive at this price is how Anker didn’t strip away support or design to make it cheaper. The build feels premium, the surface has enough grip to keep devices in place, and the magnets snap precisely where they should. <strong>Coming in at under $13 per pad</strong>, the value here borders on absurd when compared to single‑charger prices from other brands.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[This Tiny Gadget Lets You Connect Your Bluetooth Headphones to the Plane’s Screen, and It Costs Pennies]]></title>
            <link>https://kotaku.com/this-tiny-gadget-lets-you-connect-your-bluetooth-headphones-to-the-planes-screen-and-it-costs-pennies-2000644579</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/this-tiny-gadget-lets-you-connect-your-bluetooth-headphones-to-the-plane%E2%80%99s-screen-and-it-costs-pennies.1354642/</guid>

              <p>If you’ve ever been stuck<strong> on a long flight watching a movie with those cheap wired earbuds the airline hands out</strong>, you’ll understand why small Bluetooth transmitters exist. The <em>Ugreen</em> airplane Bluetooth 6.0 transmitter solves one of the most annoying travel problems: letting you use your own wireless headphones with the in‑flight entertainment system. Right now, <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5599/">it’s down to an all‑time low price of $18, down from its usual $27 on Amazon</a>. It’s the kind of tiny gadget that instantly makes travel more comfortable and feels like a small luxury upgrade.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5599/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>A Game‑Changer for Travel</h2>
<p>What’s so clever about this little adapter is that it turns <strong>almost any traditional audio source into a wireless one</strong>. Plug it into the headphone jack on the plane seat, the TV in your hotel room or even an old car stereo, and you can connect your Bluetooth earbuds or headset in seconds. No tangled wires, no adapters dangling from your seat — just your own choice of headphones and clear sound.</p>



<p>The connection quality is surprisingly solid for something this small. <strong>Due to Bluetooth 6.0, pairing happens almost instantly</strong> and the range extends up to 10 meters — that’s enough to move freely in a living room or even stroll across a hotel suite without losing the signal. The newer Bluetooth spec also cuts down the annoying audio delay that used to make videos and games slightly out of sync.</p>



<p>What’s more, the Ugreen unit <strong>holds up to 18 hours of use in receiver mode and 16 hours in transmission mode</strong>&nbsp;which will easily cover a full day of travel, including layovers and entertainment before landing. You can charge it during use if needed, but in practice, most users say it goes days between charges. For frequent flyers, that’s the difference between a gadget you need to babysit and one you can forget about until the next trip.</p>



<p>But what really makes this adapter flexible is its two‑in‑one design: In TX or transmit mode, it streams audio from non-Bluetooth devices such as airline seats, TVs, or older gaming consoles, directly to wireless headphones. In RX or receive mode, meanwhile, the device does the opposite, turning wired speakers or car stereos into Bluetooth receivers. You can stream music from your phone to your old home speakers or plug it into a car AUX port for instant wireless audio playback.</p>
<p>Even better, the Ugreen transmitter is able to <strong>pair with two pairs of headphones simultaneously</strong>. So if you’re traveling with a friend or partner, both of you can watch the same movie from the plane’s screen without bothering to split a pair of wired earbuds. It’s a simple feature, but one that genuinely makes those long flights more enjoyable. The built‑in microphone is another nice touch – if you’re using it in receiver mode with your phone, you can answer calls hands‑free without disconnecting.</p>
<p>At this price, it’s hard to think of another gadget that adds this much comfort to travel and everyday listening. The build quality is solid, the functionality is well thought out, and it covers so many small annoyances that accumulate over time. It’s the kind of item that costs very little yet quietly changes how you travel and listen. And considering this $18 deal is the lowest it’s ever gone on Amazon, it might be one of those rare impulse buys that pays off immediately.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Samsung Quietly Unloads Its T9 4TB SSDs on Amazon, Now Selling at a New All-Time Low]]></title>
            <link>https://kotaku.com/samsung-quietly-unloads-its-t9-4tb-ssds-on-amazon-now-selling-at-a-new-all-time-low-2000644574</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/samsung-quietly-unloads-its-t9-4tb-ssds-on-amazon-now-selling-at-a-new-all-time-low.1354609/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>The ultimate luxury for anyone juggling big files&nbsp;: <strong>SSDs are faster, quieter, and far more reliable than the old-school hard drives</strong> we all grew up with. Of course, that performance usually comes with a pretty steep price. But not today: Samsung <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4947/">just dropped its sleek T9 Portable SSD 4TB to a new all‑time low of $299, down from $399 on Amazon</a>.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4947/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Speed and Stability</h2>
<p>And that’s exactly what tech enthusiasts like most about SSDs: the speed. The T9 doesn’t just deliver: it dominates <strong>with sequential read and write speeds of up to 2,000 MB/s</strong>. That means heavy 4K videos, raw photos, or huge design projects pop up in seconds instead of minutes. For creators, gamers, and students managing several devices, it’s a serious timesaver without the dreaded transfer delays. Better yet, those speeds stay constant during long tasks-no throttling midway through some big job.</p>



<p>Inside, Samsung marries its <strong>trusted V‑NAND flash memory with a USB 3.2 Gen 2×2 interface</strong> to ensure top performance on modern hardware setups. And unlike older drives that overheat under pressure, <strong>the T9 stays really cool</strong> thanks to its Dynamic Thermal Guard. It automatically regulates temperature to prevent overheating, keeping everything stable even during hours of high‑intensity use.</p>



<p>Durability is another area where Samsung didn’t cut corners: The <strong>T9 has a rugged, textured casing</strong> that helps withstand drops and scratches, making it safe to toss into a laptop bag or camera kit. It’s built for travel, jammed workdays, and unpredictable coffee-shop setups. The design is practical yet premium, with rounded corners and a matte black finish that feels as polished as the tech inside.</p>
<p>Compatibility, meanwhile, couldn’t be easier. The <strong>T9 connects easily to Windows PCs, Macs, game consoles</strong> and even newer smartphones like the iPhone 17 Pro, which now supports direct 4K ProRes video capture directly to the drive. For content creators shooting high‑resolution footage, that alone can justify the purchase. That means no more running out of internal storage mid‑recording and no more waiting for files to move before editing begins.</p>
<p>Making long‑term ownership even smoother is the inclusion of Samsung’s <em>Magician Software</em> suite: It automatically handles firmware updates, security management, and health monitoring in the background, so that performance stays optimal without requiring manual tinkering. Encryption options keep sensitive documents protected if the drive is lost or stolen, while regular checks help to prevent data degradation over time.</p>



<p>And it’s even more exciting because<strong> Samsung is the number-one flash memory brand in the world</strong>. But still, the main reason this model gets attention right now is the price dro: Seeing a 4TB drive of this quality dip below the $300 mark is borderline unheard of. It essentially makes high‑speed, professional grade storage accessible to regular consumers.</p>
