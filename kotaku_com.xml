              <p>Too many things in our life need to get plugged in. Our phones, watches, headphones — damn near everything that isn’t attached to us needs to be charged at the end of the day. And now that it’s gotten even more complicated that everything is moving away from USB-A to USB-C. Sure, USB-C is a better standard and can do a lot more, but now I’ve got a bunch of USB-A charging blocks that are worthless to me. It’s time for a singular solution. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3985/">Anker has its Prime Charger with a clock LCD display one sale for 35% off. Normally, it goes for $170, but for a limited time the price has shot down to just $110.</a> That’s a savings of $60.</p>
<p>Avoid having a ton of clutter and cables running everywhere at your desk or on your nightstand. The Anker Prime Charger has four USB-C ports and two USB-A ports so you can keep all your devices together and nearby when it’s time to charge them. USB-C i universally compatible so use the hub to charge your laptops whether they are Apple or PC, your phone whether its an iPhone, Galaxy, or something else. Charge your earbuds, tablets, and more.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3985/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<p>The Anker Prime Charger is capable of a maximum output of 250W between its six different ports. Three of the four USB-C ports each support 100W individually. The first one is special, capable of an output of 140W. Over that one, you can charge your stuff super quickly. A 16-inch MacBook Pro can go from zero to 50% in just 25 minutes. It will be fully charge in just over an hour and a half.</p>
<h2>Tailor Your Charging With Smart Power Control</h2>
<p>The dial on the side of the hub can be used to adjust the charging priority for your various devices plugged in. You can choose between port priority mode, dual laptop mode, or low current mode. Or just select AI power mode to have it automatically adjust to what is optimal.</p>



<p>The front of the USB hub is equipped with a large 2.26-inch display which can showcase the time and date. This makes it a lovely addition to your nightstand or your desktop while working. When you devices are plugged into any of the front USB-C ports, the display will visualize its charging status with dynamic animation.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3985/">For a limited time, the Anker Prime Charger for USB-C and USB-A charging has dropped in price by $60.</a> Get it now for just $110 before it goes back up.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>For all the Android-heads out there, you can upgrade whatever you’re working with now to the Samsung Galaxy Z Flip7 for a discounted price.<a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3984/"> At this time, Samsung’s seventh generation flippable smartphone has dropped by 14% for the base storage option and by 12% for the large storage option</a>. The 256GB Galaxy smartphone is down from $1,100 to $950, saving you $150. Likewise, the 512GB model is down from $1,220 to $1,070, also saving you $150. Amazon has three color options all on sale. Choose between blue shadow, coral red, or jet black.</p>
<p>Samsung first launched it flippable and foldable lines of smartphones back in 2020. If you’ve been afraid to jump on as an early adopter before the kinks have all been worked at, well now we’re on the seventh generation. It’s got quite a bit of updates since then so now’s a good time to get on board.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3984/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<p>When closed, the Samsung Galaxy Z Flip7 can display the time, date, your notifications, and other brief details across its edge-to-edge cover screen.</p>
<p>Take hand-free selfies. Just open the Flip7 at a 90-degree angle so it can stand itself up. now you can use the outer camera lenses to take high-quality selfies (higher than front-facing cameras tend to be). Even use it for recording videos or taking video calls as you’re able to see your video and your callers video thanks to the cover screen. The outside features a 12MP ultra-wide lens as well as a 50MP wide lens capable of 2x optical quality zoom. If you still want to use the inside main camera, that one is 10MP.</p>



<h2>Flip Without Fear</h2>
<p>Now I’d understand your main concern with a flip phone being it’s durability. Plenty of flip phones snapped at their hinges back in the day, so how does the Flip7 hold up? Well, it’s built with Armor FlexHinge which is designed to close thinner while protecting the phone’s hinge. There are seven generations of iteration and innovation at play here. Additionally, it’s protected with Corning Gorilla Glass Victus 2 and is encased in a strong yet light Armor Aluminum frame.</p>
<p>Though, the most underrated feature is being to hang up dramatically. When’s the last time you yell “Good day!” through the phone and then slammed it shut. Gently pressing the End Call button just doesn’t have the same oomph.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3984/">Get yourself the Samsung Galaxy Flip7 in three stylish colors for $150 off for a limited time</a>. The 256GB model is down to $950 while the 512GB model is down to $1,070.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Small gaming accessory maker Genki <a href="https://kotaku.com/nintendo-switch-2-rumors-genki-ces-2025-official-1851736830">made a big splash at this year’s CES</a> after it flaunted a mockup of the Switch 2 on the show floor at the expo. Nintendo turned around and sued in May, accusing the company behind carrying cases and Joy-Con grips of infringing on its trademarks by using the hype around leaks to market accessories for the upcoming hardware. This week, the two sides reached a “confidential settlement” that, among other things, bars Genki from ever calling one of its promotional livestreams a “Direct.”</p> <p>“[Genki is permanently enjoined from] using the terms ‘Glitch,’ ‘Glitch 2,’ ‘Genki Direct,’ ‘Genki Indirect,’ or any other similar rebranding or approximation of Nintendo’s intellectual property, products, product names, characters, presentations, or marks; i.e. for any accessories compatible or marketed for use with Nintendo’s products, implementing product packaging, product designs, and product descriptions that fail to make clear to consumers Genki’s status as an unlicensed accessory manufacturer,” reads <a href="https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.cacd.969015/gov.uscourts.cacd.969015.30.1.pdf">part of the agreement</a>&nbsp;ordered on September 8. Genki also agreed to “payment in an agreed-upon amount” in the “confidential settlement” with Nintendo.</p> <p>The legal dispute stems from Genki’s CES 2025 antics which included not just a 3D-printed replica of the Switch 2 for showing off accessories but also the accessory manufacturer’s claims that it had based the designs on access to a genuine piece of Nintendo’s then-unrevealed hardware. The stunt seemingly forced Nintendo’s hand, and the company, <a href="https://kotaku.com/switch-2-reveal-trailer-date-nintendo-mario-kart-9-1851739487">amid a flurry of other leaks</a>, ended up officially teasing the new console later that month ahead of a full Nintendo Direct dedicated to the Switch 2 in April.</p>

 <p>When the Mario maker hit back in May with a trademark infringement lawsuit, Genki wrote in a statement, “What we can say is this: Genki has always been an independent company focused on building innovative gaming accessories for the community we love. We’re proud of the work we’ve done, and we stand by the quality and originality of our products.” The Switch 2 versions of some of those products <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/08/after-some-early-issues-genki-has-finally-upgraded-select-switch-2-accessories">had minor issues</a> at launch but have since been revised.</p> <p>Was pissing off Nintendo worth it to get the world’s attention for Joy-Con grips and carrying cases? Without knowing the secret terms of the settlement, it’s hard to guess. But Genki is clearly taking it seriously now. The box for the Attack Vector Swappable Grip Case for the Switch 2 carries the following fine print disclaimer on the back: “Attack Vector is not affiliated with, sponsored by, or endorsed by Nintendo.”</p>
