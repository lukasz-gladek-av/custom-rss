              <p><em>Call of Duty: Black Ops 7</em> is proving pretty popular with critics. The latest entry in the infinitely-running series is sitting on a&nbsp;<a href="https://www.metacritic.com/game/call-of-duty-black-ops-7/critic-reviews/?platform=pc">Metascore of 83</a>, with no reviews so far marked as “negative.” The same, however, can not be said of user reviews. At a desultory <a href="https://www.metacritic.com/game/call-of-duty-black-ops-7/user-reviews/?platform=pc">Metascore of 1.9</a>, it’s the worst-rated&nbsp;<em>Call of Duty</em> ever.</p>

 <p>A lot of the ire in the Metascore reviews is focused on the game’s “lackluster” multiplayer-only campaign, faulty matchmaking, litany of bugs, and very unfavorable comparisons with <em>Arc Raiders</em>, but the use of AI also comes up a great deal as people vent their frustrations. It was noticed immediately after launch that the latest entry in one of the biggest franchises in the world had used AI-plagiarized art for player banners, calling cards and even artwork within the campaign. <a href="https://kotaku.com/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-ai-art-activision-statement-blops7-steam-ps5-2000644397">When&nbsp;<em>Kotaku</em> approached Activision for comment on this</a>, the company seemed entirely nonplussed by the situation, simply stating “Like so many around the world, we use a variety of digital tools, including AI tools, to empower and support our teams…”</p>

 <p>“Just pure trash full of ai slop,” says one Metacritic user. “What AI bot did they use to puke up this garbage?” asks another. A third comments, “It’s just another hurriedly rushed AI slop-fest.” One comment that appears to capture the mood of most poetically phrases it, “Unbelievable, abysmal dogshit. Save your money please! The use of AI is just the cherry on top.”</p>

 <p>Of course, user scores do tend to be marked on a binary scale, rather than adopting the full spread of numbers. People tend to leave reviews not out of a sense of civic duty, but rather because they’re either delighted or furious, hence the majority of these scores being a possibly somewhat exaggerated 0. Scattered throughout (albeit very much in the minority), bringing the overall average to 1.9, are 9s and 10s from enthusiasts. It’s obviously not a useful metric of a game’s quality, but it’s certainly a very useful way to see which way a game is being received by the wider public.</p>

 <p>Meanwhile, over on Steam, the game is currently sitting on the very low end of “Mixed” reviews, with just 42 percent of reader reviews finding&nbsp;<em>Black Ops 7</em> to be positive. (However, that rating drops to “Mostly Negative” when reviews are filtered for English language only. Chinese players seem to be having a better response.) “chatgpt generate me a lackluster campaign with reused assets and cringe worthy dialogue,” reads one popular review. “Activision just pay for art you clearly have money and it won’t look like shit,” says another.</p> <p>It’s something of a relief that the brazen use of AI in games still generates fury like this, players yet to be inoculated to it by its widespread use. Companies are keen to trot out the “But everyone else is doing it!” excuse, like a child caught cheating in a test, but right now this isn’t cutting it with audiences. It seems pretty likely that any major company pledging&nbsp;<em>not</em> to use AI could win enormous favor with players in this climate. It’s probably worth a try!</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/airpods-max-alternative-these-bose-ultra-headphones-reach-new-all-time-low-on-amazon.1355248/</guid>

              <p>It typically takes over $500 to get flagship features from premium noise-canceling headphones and Apple’s AirPods Max sit at $549 with no discounts in sight. For way less money, Bose’s QuietComfort Ultra headphones deliver comparable spatial audio, adaptive noise cancellation, and 24-hour battery life. The good news is that they <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5342/">just dropped to $298 on Amazon right now, down from the usual $429</a>. That’s a new all-time low and nearly half the price of AirPods Max which make these the obvious choice if you want premium features without the Apple tax.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5342/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Spatial Audio That Works</h2>
<p>The QuietComfort Ultra uses Bose’s I<strong>mmersive Audio technology to create spatial sound</strong> that feels like it’s coming from around you instead of directly into your ears. That works across any audio source, from streaming music to podcasts to movies, and doesn’t require special encoding like some competing spatial audio systems. CustomTune technology analyzes your ear shape and automatically adjusts the sound profile, so you get audio tuned specifically to how your ears receive sound.</p>
<p><strong>Three listening modes</strong> let you determine exactly how much of the outside world you want to hear. Quiet Mode gives you full active noise cancellation, shutting out ambient sound almost entirely for your next flight or a moment of focus in a noisy space. Aware Mode pipes in the outside audio so that you can hear flight announcements or converse with people without removing the headphones. Immersion Mode blends noise cancellation with spatial audio for the most immersive way of listening-although it eats more battery than the other modes do.</p>



<p>The microphone system focuses on your voice while filtering background noise and creates phone calls clearer than ever on any Bose headphones. Multiple mics work in concert to isolate your voice from wind, traffic, or crowded spaces, and people on the other end hear you without the competing noise drowning you out. It matters far more than it sounds like it would, since most pairs of headphones focus on music playback and treat call quality as an afterthought.</p>



<p>Comfort design employs soft ear cushions that seal around your ears without creating pressure points, and weight distribution on the headband falls evenly across the top of your head. You can wear these for hours without that hot, squeezed feeling some over-ear headphones create. Materials feel premium but not fragile, with metal reinforcements in stress points and cushions that keep their shape over time.</p>
<p>The <strong>battery life reaches 24 hours with standard listening or 18 hours with Immersive Audio mode active</strong>. That is good for several days of commuting or a number of long flights before you need to recharge. A 15-minute quick charge adds 2.5 hours of listening time, meaning even if you forget to charge them overnight, a quick top-up while you’re getting ready in the morning should give you enough juice for the day. The <strong>USB-C charging port</strong> uses the same cable that most modern devices use, so you won’t need any Bose-specific chargers when traveling.</p>
<p><strong>Bluetooth 5.3 provides stable connections up to 30 feet</strong> from your device with lower latency than older Bluetooth versions. You can walk around your house or office without your phone in your pocket, and the connection stays solid without dropouts or stuttering. <em>SimpleSync</em> lets you pair these headphones with Bose smart soundbars to watch TV at your own volume, not blasting sound through speakers and annoying roommates or family.</p>
<p>The <strong>foldable design collapses into a travel case that’s included in the box</strong>, and protects the headphones during transport without adding too much bulk to your bag. It holds the headphones securely in, with a pocket for the charging cable to keep everything organized rather than loose cables tangling with other gear. The hinges feel solid, not wobbly or creaky, which is important since these are the parts most likely to break on foldable headphones.</p>
<p>For $298, you’re getting flagship-level noise cancellation, spatial audio, premium build quality, and 24-hour battery life for roughly half of what Apple asks for similar features.</p>

              <p>LEGO sets that use specific instructions look great on shelves but they don’t teach kids how to build from imagination. A classic brick box gives them raw materials and lets them figure out what to make instead of just following steps to recreate someone else’s design. This medium brick box includes 484 pieces in 35 different colors with wheels, windows, eyes, and a green baseplate for building whatever comes to mind. It <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4299/">drops to just $17 on Amazon, down from the usual $34</a>. That’s an <strong>all-time low for a set this size with this much variety,</strong> and it’s the kind of price that makes stocking up for birthdays or holidays affordable.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4299/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Great for Creativity</h2>
<p>The 484-piece count gives kids enough bricks to<strong> create multiple creations at once</strong> instead of constantly tearing things apart to make something new. You get 35 different colors, which sounds excessive until you realize that having color variety lets kids create more realistic builds where different parts of a structure actually look distinct. The included 18 tires with wheel rims mean vehicles become an obvious building option and the windows plus toy eyes add character to buildings and creatures.</p>
<p>The green baseplate measures <strong>over three inches long and six inches wide</strong>, and provides a stable foundation for constructions that would otherwise topple over on a table. Baseplates matter more than most people realize, since they let kids build upward without having to worry about stability, and the green color works for grass, fields, parks, or any outdoor scene. If you grab more than one set, you can stick multiple baseplates together, creating larger building surfaces for ambitious projects.</p>



<p>Cross-compatibility with all LEGO construction sets means <strong>these bricks work with any other LEGO pieces you already own</strong>. Kids can mix this classic collection with themed sets like City, Friends, or Creator to expand their options without worrying about pieces not fitting together. This is across decades of LEGO production, so even vintage bricks from the 80s or 90s snap together perfectly with these new pieces.</p>



<p>The<strong> large plastic storage container serves as organization when play is over</strong>, keeping bricks contained instead of scattered across the floor, just waiting to ambush bare feet. There’s a handle for easy transport, which is conducive to kids taking their LEGO collection to friends’ houses or on trips without dumping loose bricks into a backpack. Of course, proper storage extends the life of the set, as pieces stay together and don’t get lost in couch cushions or vacuumed up by accident.</p>
<p>The builds, such as trains, cars, and tiger figures, will inspire kids when they don’t know what to do or need ideas. You can find simple building ideas in the included instructions or online, but the whole point is adapting those ideas into original creations. A basic train design becomes a starting point for adding cargo cars, passenger sections, or fantasy elements like wings or laser cannons. The tiger figure teaches how to use specific pieces for eyes and features, then kids apply that knowledge to building their own animals or creatures.</p>
<p><strong>The age range is from 4 to 99</strong> which reflects both young kids just learning to build and adults who still enjoy creative construction. Younger children focus on simpler builds and color sorting, whereas older kids create complex structures with moving parts or detailed scenes. Adults use them for desk decorations, stress relief, or collaborative building sessions with their kids.</p>
<p>At $17 for 484 pieces with specialty elements like wheels, windows, and a baseplate, <strong>you’re paying about 3.5 cents per brick</strong>. That’s exceptional value for real LEGO, particularly given that themed sets often ring in at 10 to 15 cents per piece.</p>
