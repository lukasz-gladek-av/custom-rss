              <p>Pokémon Poke-nade Monster Ball may sound like the world’s weirdest energy drink crossover, but it is in fact the translated name for Pokémon’s latest venture, a Tamagotchi-style interactive keychain pet, albeit far more complex than the Tamagotchis of old. Which of course raises two all-important questions: Can you let the Pokémon starve to death? And will it poop?</p> <p>This&nbsp;<em>isn’t</em> a Pokémon x Tamagotchi situation, it should be said. That has happened before, as a matter of fact: an official crossover with Bandai Namco’s pocket toys happened in 2019, with the retro devices selling out day one on the Pokémon Center. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S1p92K06svQ">YouTuber UnlistedLeaf</a> once found himself trapped caring for a teeny pixel Eevee that incessantly demanded food, but instead of pooping would cough up furballs. And no, that one didn’t die if you failed to look after it, but instead ran away. Which is kind of horrifying in its own right.</p>  <p>This new venture (<a href="https://essential-japan.com/news/pokemon-is-getting-its-own-official-tamagotchi-style-virtual-pet/">spotted by <em>Essential Japan</em></a>), which is with Bandai rival Takara Tomy looks like a much more advanced toy. First of all, it’s in color, but also encased in a Poké ball shell, with a touch-sensitive screen. The latter is because a part of looking after your pocket-sized pocket monster is stroking it (that’s the “Poke-nade” part of the name, which is a portmanteau of Pokémon and “naderu,” to stroke).</p>

 <p>Apparently, poking at the screen will get the Pokémon to react in various cutesy ways. According to&nbsp;<em>Essential Japan</em>, “the Pokémon will react differently depending on the length and speed of the petting,” and you are fully able to make your own revolting jokes right here.</p> <p>The Monster Ball sounds pretty impressively in-depth compared to the Tamagotchi, which could only eat, sick up fur, and eventually evolve. This new toy will let you play with the Pokémon, and even take part in Pokémon battles. There’s also a diary feature that’ll remember all your previous interactions, and the device will apparently offer 157 different Pokémon to choose from. Some of them—Pikachu, Eevee, Sprigatito, Fuecoco, Quaxly, Lucario and Sylveon—will even be voiced and come with more detailed animations.</p>

 <figure id="attachment_2000623448" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000623448"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000623448">© The Pokémon Company</figcaption></figure> <p>That inclusion of Sylveon on the list does suggest one peculiar aspect, however. If you can start with an Eevee or a Sylveon, it does indicate that the monsters might not be able to evolve. An odd choice if true, especially given the Paldean starter Pokémon included get far more entertaining as they grow.</p> <p>It looks like these will be a Japan-only release for now, but despite featuring a touch screen and far more complexity than a Tamagotchi, they’re surprisingly cheap. ¥7,480, which works out to just over $50. However, I’m absolutely certain they’ll sell out almost instantly, and go for far higher resale prices to the rest of the world.</p> <p>But can they die?! Do they poop?! We <em>don’t know</em>. It seems incredibly unlikely, given The Pokémon Company overrode the usual rules for Tamagotchi when it partnered with them, but it’ll be interesting to learn how the game responds to a bad owner. Or a messy one.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>You can never have too much storage space. If you’re someone who works with huge files such as a photographer or video editor, you don’t have to be told twice. When a good external drive goes on sale, it’s hard to pass it up. Well, that’s exactly what this is. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3932/">The Samsung T7 Shield is available at Amazon with three different storage capacities — all off which are discounted by as much as $125</a>. Right now, the 1TB model is down 19% from $135 to just $110, the 2TB model is down 35% from $230 to $150, and the 4TB model is down from $405 to $280.</p>
<p>Creators were front of mind when Samsung developed this external solid state drive. It doesn’t matter if you are a photographer in need to backing up your pictures, a video editor managing a ton of projects and footage, or anyone else dealing with big files all day long — the T7 Shield can keep up with you. This SSD has fast read and write speeds. You’re getting up to 1,050 MB/s read speeds and up to 1,000 MB/s write speeds. That clocks in two times faster than the T5 from Samsung. It also happens to be nearly 10 times faster than an HDD would be. This means you’ll be able to move files between your work station and external drive quickly and easily.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3932/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<p>For the videographers out there, the Samsung T7 Shield is an especially useful tool for your toolkit. This model lets you record in 4K at 60fps directly onto the drive, using a camera, smartphone, or tablet. It’s even compatible with the iPhone 15 Pro. No need to anxiously delete stuff from your camera roll before you can get the shot.</p>
<p>You have a choice of three different colors with the T7 Shield—pick between either black, beige, or blue. What I love about this is if you need to get multiple, just grab them in different colors. This way at a glance, you’ll quickly be able to remember which one is for what.</p>



<h2>Ruggedly Reliable</h2>
<p>As the name states, this is the Shield model of Samsung’s T7 SSD. It’s designed with a strong, rubberized exterior wrapped around a solid aluminum body. It’s got an IP65 rating, making it both water and dust resistant and it can even withstand a fall of 9.8 feet. Your data is well protected.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3932/">Right now, Amazon has the 1TB, 2TB, and 4TB models of the Samsung T7 Shield on sale for as much as 35% off.</a> Grab one before they go back up.</p>

              <p>Happy Silksong Weekend to all who celebrate. If you’re not playing the most anticipated game of the decade right now, I can only imagine it’s because you don’t own any gaming console or PC to play it on. So, here! Let me help you. <strong>The Xbox Series S is a wonderful option for an entry-level game system and right now it happens to be on sale</strong>. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3931/">It’s MSRP is $380, but for a limited time, you can grab one for 13% off at just $329.</a></p>
<p>Now for the elephant in the room… Back when the Xbox Series X and Series S first launched in 2020, the latter of which was priced at just $300. A few months back, Microsoft made and announcement confirming plans to raise the price of its consoles and games. The Xbox Series S went up by $80 to $380. So while this discount brings console down lower than the current list price, this Series S is still $29 more than it had been for five years (ignoring any other discounts over that time). It stinks, but it is what it is.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3931/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>All-Digital Gaming Console</h2>
<p>This model comes with a controller and hold 512GB. It’s disc-free so you’ll be downloading all your games onto that internal storage or onto an external SSD which you can purchase separately. It may not have 4K gaming, but it can still produce higher than standard HD resolution at 1440p. Plus, it’s got HDR support to ensure that the darks look dark and the bright colors pop. It can handle refresh rates of up to 120FPS so performance is still pretty great.</p>
<p>Like it’s counterpart, the Xbox Series X, this console has a feature called Quick Resume. No longer do you need to worry about finding a save point when you want switch to a different game. You can suspend your gameplay in the background, hop into something else, then return to it later right where you left off. My apologies to any game dev who works on title screens because I only ever see those once.</p>



<p>Quick Resume is possible because of the Xbox Velocity Architecture, which also allows for super-fast load times.</p>
<p>You can enjoy streaming your favorite TV shows and movies right on the Xbox Series S. Download apps like YouTube, Netflix, HBO Max. While your games are locked to 1440p, you can still stream video from Disney+, Netflix, Amazon, Hulu and more in full 4K.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3931/">For a limited time, the Xbox Series S is down to just $329.</a></p>

            <title><![CDATA[Mark Zuckerberg Sues Facebook (Sort Of)]]></title>
            <link>https://kotaku.com/mark-zuckerberg-sues-facebook-lawyer-meta-2000623429</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>If you found that headline confusing, try to imagine the constant bemusing misery that arrives at the door of seemingly the only other Mark Zuckerberg, an attorney who is finding his life made increasingly complicated by the shared name. So even though it’s not actually Meta’s Mark Zuckerberg that’s suing Mark Zuckerberg’s Meta, the mop-haired billionaire remains the cause of the consternation, because for Indiana lawyer Mark Zuckerberg, sharing the Facebook creator’s name is causing him massive issues in both his work and personal life, and indeed costing him lots of money.</p> <p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2025/09/04/mark-zuckerberg-sues-mark-zuckerberg/">As reported by&nbsp;<em>TechCrunch</em></a>, Mark S. Zuckerberg—a bankruptcy attorney from Indiana—is repeatedly having his paid-for Facebook posts removed by Meta, and his accounts closed down, on the inaccurate basis that he’s falsely impersonating Mark E. Zuckerberg, co-creator of Facebook—and he’s not getting his money back. He’s had enough.</p> <p>Speaking to Indiana’s WTHR, Mark S. explained that he and Facebook’s Zuck are the only two people he can find who share the name, meaning his situation is rather unique. Four times Facebook has suspended the attorney’s business account and deleted his firm’s advertisements, based on the belief that he’s deliberately trying to pass himself off as the tech billionaire, and then failing to return his resulting lost costs. So this Zuckerberg is now suing that Zuckerberg to get his money back, his legal fees paid, and potential lost money as a result of Meta’s actions.</p>

  <p>“All my competitors advertise on Facebook,” says our new favorite Mark Zuckerberg, “so I have to do it too.” Speaking to the Indianapolis news station, he says he pays for ads, “they take my money, but then they shut me down.”</p> <p>Meta gave a statement to WTHR saying, “We know there’s more than one Mark Zuckerberg in the world and we are getting to the bottom of this.”</p>

 <p>Mark S. Zuckerberg’s life isn’t only affected in this way. It seems sharing his name with one of the most controversial figures in the world comes with a personal cost, too. He has in fact <a href="https://iammarkzuckerberg.com/">dedicated an entire website to the topic</a>, on which he talks about how even his personal Facebook account has been suspended five times, despite providing three forms of identification each time he re-opens it, and when it’s working he’s the constant target of hacking attempts, while his phone blows up with notifications every night. (Dude, come on, just turn the notifications off. And don’t even have the app on your phone. No one should. It’s looking at data from all your other apps.) His office receives daily phone calls from furious people demanding tech support, and he says he “routinely” receives death threats and harassment via Messenger.</p> <p>In fact, at one point he was <a href="https://iammarkzuckerberg.com/docs/20250821111936235R.pdf">accidentally sued by the State of Washington</a>, which somehow mistook him for the other guy. And that must suck. Short of changing his own name (and really, the world should surely be able to cope with two people using it), he’s left resorting to legal action to at least not have it cost him money. Oh, and the attention it’s attracting in the press probably won’t do him much harm, either.</p> <p>Mark S. Zuckerberg’s site ends on a lovely note:</p> <p>“Like I said, I don’t wish Mark E. Zuckerberg any ill will at all. I hope the best for him, but let me tell you this: I will rule the search for ‘<a href="https://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;safe=off&amp;q=mark+zuckerberg+bankruptcy&amp;aq=f&amp;aqi=g1&amp;aql=&amp;oq=&amp;gs_rfai=" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Mark Zuckerberg bankruptcy</a>‘. And if he does fall upon difficult financial times, and happens to be in Indiana, I will gladly handle his case in honor of our eponymy.”</p>
