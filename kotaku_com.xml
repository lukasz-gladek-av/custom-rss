              <p>Sony was probably saving this announcement for the <a href="https://kotaku.com/sonys-september-state-of-play-new-rumors-and-where-to-watch-2000628219">September State of Play</a> but it’s leaked ahead of time. According to <a href="https://www.dealabs.com/magazine/cette-pepite-fera-partie-des-jeux-du-mois-doctobre-2025-du-playstation-plus-essential-60568">Dealab’s billbil-kun</a>, October’s big PS Plus game is <em>Alan Wake 2</em>.</p> <p>The survival horror GOTY contender came out two years ago next month and catapulted <em>Alan Wake</em> into the ever-expanding Remedyverse following the success of <em>Control</em> before it. The mind-warping metanarrative will be part of the Essentials tier, meaning everyone who has even the cheapest PS Plus subscription option will be able to download and play it as long as they stay paying members of the service.</p> <p><em>Alan Wake 2 </em>follows FBI agent Saga Anderson as she investigates a cult responsible for a string of murders in Bright Falls. Coming out 13 years after the original, the sequel takes place that long after the original, too, picking up where the prior game’s narrative threads left off and only getting way weirder from there. If you’re planning on giving <em>Alan Wake 2</em> a spin next month, you’ll definitely want to make sure you’ve completed the original game first.</p> <p>The first game is available to revisit via a remaster released a couple years back. The good news is it’s currently on sale <a href="https://store.playstation.com/en-us/product/UP1477-PPSA01924_00-AWREMASTERED0001">for just $5</a> on PS5 and PS4, but you only have another day to claim it at that price. The sale ends after September 25.</p>

              <p>A CG-rendered trailer for <em><a href="https://kotaku.com/games/pubg-mobile">PUBG Mobile</a>‘</em>s next big update appears to confirm previous rumors that Sonic the Hedgehog is going to be appearing soon in the popular mobile port of the battle royale game. But it also features Sega’s mascot fighting… Skibidi Toilets?</p> <p>On September 24, <a href="https://x.com/Sonic_Hotspot/status/1970848502566850838">Sonic Hotspot on Twitter posted</a> what appears to be a real trailer for a yet-to-be-announced or confirmed Sonic crossover event in the long-running <em>PUBG Mobile. </em>This was spotted and s<a href="https://bsky.app/profile/sonicstadium.org/post/3lzlv3hy5o22u">shared by<em> SonicStadium.org</em> on Bluesky.</a> The pre-rendered event trailer shows Sonic the Hedgehog fighting a massive Skibidi Toilet character. Here’s the leaked trailer, and sorry in advance. I was going to link a YouTube re-upload of it, but that has since been removed. Hmm..</p> <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="zxx" dir="ltr"><a href="https://t.co/BaLCNi5eAV">pic.twitter.com/BaLCNi5eAV</a></p> <p>— Sonic Hotspot (@Sonic_Hotspot) <a href="https://twitter.com/Sonic_Hotspot/status/1970848502566850838?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">September 24, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <p>Skibidi Toilets, <a href="https://kotaku.com/youtube-skibidi-toilet-song-dafuqboom-tiktok-explained-1850660405">which were created as part of a now massively popular YouTube animated series of shorts</a>, were already <a href="https://x.com/PUBGMOBILE/status/1970548836260069598">announced</a> to be coming to <em>PUBG Mobile</em> later this month, so it’s no surprise they are popping up in a leaked trailer. And Sonic has been rumored to be coming to <em>PUBG Mobile</em> for a few months now. Sega’s beloved mascot was <a href="https://www.topuplive.com/news/pubg-mobile-sonic-collaboration.html">even teased last month</a> in an official <em>PUBG Mobile</em> post promising six new collaborations. So that’s also not a big surprise for fans, but a nice confirmation that he’ll be here soon. However, I don’t think anybody was expecting Sonic’s reveal to include <a href="https://kotaku.com/skibidi-toilet-outfit-costume-spirit-halloween-kids-1851637121">Skibidi Toilets</a>.</p>

 <p>There is something deeply depressing about watching Sonic fight a <a href="https://kotaku.com/overwatch-2-venture-times-square-ad-skibidi-toilet-meme-1851561388">Skibidi Toilet</a>. It feels like my fears that all of pop culture will one day merge together into <a href="https://kotaku.com/iron-giant-multiversus-wb-smash-fighting-game-superman-1848945122">a single giant, boring blob of content</a> are coming true, and faster than expected. Everything is becoming <em>Fortnite</em>, and because all of this crossover slop is making companies millions of dollars, it’s unlikely to stop anytime soon.</p> <p>And so, that’s how we end up in a timeline where some silly videos made using the Source Engine have become a massively popular IP that has attracted the attention (and money) of <a href="https://kotaku.com/skibidi-toilet-michael-bay-movie-tv-show-real-youtube-1851603676">Michael Bay</a>. Sonic, you deserve better. <a href="https://kotaku.com/skibidi-toilet-joe-biden-colbert-late-show-clip-meme-1851496589">We all do.</a> Yet, here we are.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Sony’s September State Of Play: New Rumors And Where To Watch]]></title>
            <link>https://kotaku.com/sonys-september-state-of-play-new-rumors-and-where-to-watch-2000628219</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/sony%E2%80%99s-september-state-of-play-new-rumors-and-where-to-watch.1307352/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>The latest PlayStation Showcase <a href="https://kotaku.com/playstation-state-of-play-date-time-where-to-watch-2000627924">is later today</a>. Will it deliver or are Sony fans destined to wander the PS5 generation with big first-party announcements remaining few and far between? The Tokyo Game Show 2025-adjacent State of Play could deliver major updates on any number of highly anticipated games, including what’s next on Sony’s first-party docket for 2026. Is it finally time to see what Insomniac Games has been cooking with <em>Marvel’s Wolverine</em>?</p> <p>The September State of Play livestream begins at 5:00 p.m. ET and will stream, per usual, on YouTube and Twitch. It has a “mercifully” concise runtime of just 35 minutes, with at least some of that devoted to Housemarque’s upcoming sci-fi shooter roguelike <em>Saros</em>. That suggests it could be on deck for the first half of next year, exactly five years after the launch of<em> Returnal</em>, a development cadence that a lot of PlayStation studios are hitting this generation.</p>  <p>But what about the rest of the 2026 release slate for the PS5? Leaks <a href="https://kotaku.com/playstation-showcase-state-play-tgs-2025-ff7-remake-part-3-2000626000">earlier this month</a> suggested that a new trailer for <em>Wolverine</em>, first seen back at a September 2021 Sony showcase, was ready for primetime and likely to air during the company’s next event. A build was leaked in the malicious hack back in 2023 and the game’s creative director left the studio last year. Outside of that, we still know hardly anything about how it will play or what <em>X-Men</em> stories it will weave into its campaign.</p>

 <p>On the third-party front, there’s a rumor that our next look at<em> Lego Batman: Legacy of the Dark Knight</em> could be at the showcase to confirm a potential 2026 release window. We also know that Square Enix doesn’t have its own livestream booked for TGS, suggesting updates on <em>Kingdom Hearts 4</em>, <em>Dragon Quest 12</em>, or <em>Final Fantasy 7 Remake Part III</em> could come during Sony’s showcase. It would be great to finally be able to put the rumors about the<em> Final Fantasy 9</em> remake to bed one way or the other as well.</p>

 <p>One game that seemingly won’t be at the showcase is Bungie’s <em>Marathon</em>. <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/paultassi/2025/09/23/bungies-marathon-not-at-sonys-new-state-of-play-next-look-months-away/"><em>Forbes</em>‘ Paul Tassi reports</a> that an expected update on when the extraction shooter will launch won’t be part of the event. “The earliest we will see something more from <em>Marathon&nbsp;</em>is November. And that’s a ‘maybe,’ right now,” he writes. The game has been going through some last-minute reworks after feedback from an alpha earlier this year and a scandal over plagiarized art soon after.</p> <p>Sony previously said it was still expecting the extraction loot shooter to hit before the end of March 2026. Given the wretched state of <em>Destiny 2</em> this summer, there couldn’t be more riding on it for the company’s live-service legacy and, more importantly, Bungie’s future.</p>
