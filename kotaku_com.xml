But a fresh delay of one of the most wish-listed games on Steam makes that almost impossible. Publisher Krafton, which changed the release schedule against the objections of the studio’s founders, now denies that it did so to avoid paying the bonuses while also blaming them for the highly anticipated underwater survival sim missing its original target release date. </p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="196470" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="The Week In Games: Reignited Rivalries And More New Releases" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="123" data-playlist="196470,196299,195922" data-current="196470"><div><p>The Week In Games: Reignited Rivalries And More New Releases</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196470/196470_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196470/196470_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196470/196470_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196470/196470_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/22020.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>  “This decision was based solely on our commitment to quality and to delivering the best possible experience for players,” the South Korea-based company which also owns<em> PUBG </em><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.ign.com/articles/more-drama-in-the-murky-world-of-subnautica-2-as-official-delay-confirmation-comes-hot-on-the-heels-of-damaging-report-into-now-unlikely-250m-bonus&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/more-drama-in-the-murky-world-of-subnautica-2-as-official-delay-confirmation-comes-hot-on-the-heels-of-damaging-report-into-now-unlikely-250m-bonus" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">told <em>IGN</em></a></span> in a statement responding to<em> Bloomberg</em>’s report. “It was not influenced by any contractual or financial considerations. Additionally, the decision had already been under discussion prior to recent leadership changes at the studio.”</p><p>Unknown Worlds cofounders Charlie Cleveland, Max McGuire, and CEO Ted Gill were fired last week, despite Krafton promising the studio independence when it was purchased back in 2022. Cleveland later wrote on Reddit that the game was ready to release in Early Access later this year as originally planned, calling the move from Krafton to replace the studio’s leadership a “shock.”</p><p>The publisher now says that the decision to delay <em>Subnautica 2 </em>grew out of negative feedback from playtests. “We received valuable feedback from our community that reinforced our confidence in the game’s direction,” it wrote in its new statement. “At the same time, the feedback highlighted a few areas that could benefit from further refinement before release. As community voices play a central role in how we shape our games, we’ve made the decision to give the development team more time to implement that feedback and deliver a more complete experience.”</p><p>Krafton was less diplomatic in a new statement published on its website Thursday afternoon which accused Cleveland and McGuire of refusing to return to their leadership roles on <em>Subnautica 2 </em>after the studio’s fantasy skirmish PVP game <em>Moonbreaker </em>struggled to find an audience in 2024. The publisher blamed them for <em>Subnautica 2</em>'s failure to release in 2024 as originally planned:</p><blockquote data-type="BlockQuote"><p>Specifically, in addition to the initial $500 million purchase price, we allocated approximately 90% of the up to $250 million earn-out compensation to the three former executives, with the expectation that they would demonstrate leadership and active involvement in the development of Subnautica 2.</p><p>However, regrettably, the former leadership abandoned the responsibilities entrusted to them.<em> Subnautica 2</em> was originally planned for an Early Access launch in early 2024, but the timeline has since been significantly delayed. Krafton made multiple requests to Charlie and Max to resume their roles as Game Director and Technical Director, respectively, but both declined to do so. In particular, following the failure of <em>Moonbreaker</em>, Krafton  asked Charlie to devote himself to the development of <em>Subnautica 2</em>. However, instead of participating in the game development, he chose to focus on a personal film project.</p><p>Krafton believes that the absence of core leadership has resulted in repeated confusion in direction and significant delays in the overall project schedule.<br>The current Early Access version also falls short in terms of content volume.<br></p><p>We are deeply disappointed by the former leadership’s conduct, and above all, we feel a profound sense of betrayal by their failure to honor the trust placed in them by our fans.﻿<br></p></blockquote><p>The statement also said Krafton was “committed to fair and equitable compensation for all remaining Unknown Worlds employees who have continuously and tirelessly contributed to <em>Subnautica 2</em>’s development,” though a spokesperson for the company didn’t immediately clarify what those bonuses would look like relative to the $250 million payout previously on the table. </p><p> <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i8oqrucfXQo&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i8oqrucfXQo" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">A developer update posted on YouTube</a></span> confirmed<em> Subnautica 2 </em>would be coming to Early Access in 2025 back in April. It’s unclear what would have meaningfully changed in just two months to lead Krafton to overrule the studio’s leadership and replace them, which has now jeopardized fan enthusiasm for the game in the process. “<em>Subnautica</em>’s soul has just been ripped out,” one fan recently <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/subnautica/comments/1lpryrg/subnauticas_soul_has_just_been_ripped_out/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/subnautica/comments/1lpryrg/subnauticas_soul_has_just_been_ripped_out/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">wrote</a></span>. </p><p><em>Subnautica</em> players have  started revolting on the game’s subreddit.

The presence of this new mechanic means that drifting next to someone no longer means you’re out of the danger zone. On the flipside, you can now hit someone mid-flight on Rainbow Road even if they’re not directly in front of you. This hidden change marks a huge difference for player strategy; however, some cumbersome controls need to be mastered first.</p><h2 id="h8568"><a id=""></a>How to throw items in any direction</h2><p>Nearly every throwable item goes forward by default when you press R. Moving the left stick down while pressing R will have your character throw the item backward instead. The one exception to this is Bananas, which go backward by default and forward when moving the left stick up and pressing R.</p><p>Given that the left stick primarily functions for turning, it won’t be much help for firing anything to the side. The trick is to have access to two. <strong>If you want to throw items freely in any direction, move the camera with the right stick and then press R.</strong> They’ll be tossed wherever the camera’s pointing.</p><p>There are a couple of unfortunate issues with this. The first is that you will need to be using a pair of Joy-Cons or a Pro Controller. You’re limited to throwing items forward or backward when using a single Joy-Con. The second issue is that using the right stick is a clunky experience. Not only is the stick sensitivity pretty slow, but moving the right stick while pressing A is extremely uncomfortable.</p><p><strong>Read More:</strong> <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/mario-kart-world-smart-steering-auto-acceleration-work-1851784842&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/mario-kart-world-smart-steering-auto-acceleration-work-1851784842">What Do Smart Steering And Auto-Accelerate Do In <em>Mario Kart World</em>?</a></span></p><p>Those who <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/mario-kart-world-smart-steering-auto-acceleration-work-1851784842&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/mario-kart-world-smart-steering-auto-acceleration-work-1851784842">use Auto-Acceleration</a></span> are bound to have the easiest time with this since their thumb will be free. Otherwise, heading into your Nintendo Switch 2’s settings and remapping some buttons is the next best option.

Once those stakes are established, all bets are off. We see Sweet Tooth launching missiles, John (Anthony Mackie) dodging lightning bolts, and Quiet (Stephanie Beatriz) slicing a man open in a way that’s somehow seductive. But we’d already seen most of that in the Season 2 clip released last month. What did shock us was Axel steamrolling through the competition.</p><p>Back in April, Smith explained that Axel didn’t appear in the first season because they hadn’t yet solved one crucial challenge: “How do you do a character that is literally a giant muscular man stuck between two gigantic wheels?” Thankfully, they figured it out. Using a custom-built apparatus that, according to Smith, weighed a ton and required its own trailer, the bipedal beast finally joins the fray this season. While we don’t get a full close-up of Axel with his hands embedded in the massive wheels, we do see actor Michael James Shaw laughing sinisterly, with a clear shot of the mechanical rig strapping one of his arms to the wheel. By the looks of it, the <em>Twisted Metal</em> design team spared no expense in making him look real.</p><p>The War Wheel titan is seen racing alongside other vehicles—clearly aided by visual effects—but fans of the <em>Twisted Metal</em> games will appreciate the final result when the new season debuts on Peacock on July 31. </p></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://kotaku.com/twisted-metal-season-2-peacock-axel-anthony-mackie-1851786052]]></content:encoded>

He’s done this twice now during what he calls “Mafiathons.” </p><p>“I think I understand how important it is to make a promise to my community,” said Cenat. “So if I’m saying I’m gonna be on for 30 days, 24/7, I think it’s very important to show. That’s my mentality, like I think it’s fine to push myself to the limits that I didn’t think I could do. 30 days, 24/7, but I’ll get on camera. It’s crazy. It’s a lot of pressure too, cause you want to make sure everybody that’s watching is enjoying the time as well.”</p><p>After <em>Hot Ones</em> host (<span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://youtu.be/_CrulPUS_2o&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://youtu.be/_CrulPUS_2o" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">and fantastic interviewer)</a></span> Sean Evans pointed out how hard it must be to plan 30 days of entertaining content, Cenat talked about what happens after the stream ends, and it sounds miserable. </p><p>“Yeah, it’s crazy. After the 30 days, every time when it’s completed, the next day I’ll wake up like trying to get out of PTSD of, like, people watching me,” said Cenat. “It’s like I go through a weird phase where I feel like I’m being watched, but when you get over that, you’ll be good.” </p><p>Cenat, I’m not sure I’d ever be “good” at doing 30 days of streaming and dealing with the aftermath. Hopefully, the young streamer is careful and doesn’t push himself too hard and burn out like so many others. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://youtu.be/aDT5efihCcY?t=805&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://youtu.be/aDT5efihCcY?t=805" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Anyway, here’s the moment the famous streamer ate one of the hottest sauces on the planet.</a></span></p><p> .<br></p></div></div><br/><br/>https://kotaku.com/kai-cenat-ptsd-30-day-stream-no-break-hot-ones-twitch-1851786038]]></content:encoded>
