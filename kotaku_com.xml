              <p><span>I lose again in </span><i><span>Hades II</span></i><span>.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>Damn.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>I wake up in the same dim corner of the Crossroads, staring at the same painting. Melinoë as a baby, held by her mother Persephone. Her brother Zagreus beside them. Hades smiling down, the whole family together with the serenity of a dream you wake up forgetting.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><span>The game gives me one prompt: “Brood.”&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>When I press it, Melinoë scoffs, </span><i><span>“You don’t remember them, besides this painting and your dreams. But still you fight for them…”&nbsp;</span></i></p>

 <p><span>Another scripted moment no one will remember, lost to the churn of repetition. Brood, indeed.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>That’s pretty much all of </span><i><span>Hades II</span></i><span>: a game that repeats forever without ever meaning something more than what’s said the first time.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><span>“Death to Chronos,” Melinoë says.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>“Death to Chronos,” Hecate says.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>“Death to Chronos,” I say.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>Chronos is the enemy. Chronos must die. It’s a setup that sounds rich with mythic potential—time itself is the tyrant that must be slain—but </span><i><span>Hades II </span></i><span>never seems interested in asking what this devotion might cost its protagonist. Melinoë isn’t a character enduring a story; she’s a weapon driving it forward until the moment when the story finally surrenders.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><em><strong>This piece contains major spoilers for the story of&nbsp;</strong></em><strong>Hades II.</strong></p> <figure id="attachment_2000614569" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000614569"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000614569"><br><!--EndFragment --></figcaption></figure> <p><span>And yet, the structure of <em>Hades II</em> seems built for that interrogation. Like its predecessor, it’s a roguelike: death, rebirth, progress through repetition. A form that practically begs for introspection. Each failure could have been an opportunity to reveal more of Melinoë’s interior life. We could question what “Death to Chronos” even means to her. And yet the game never bothers, never earns her conviction. It takes her belief as a given and never really interrogates the ache that made her say it.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><span>This is what writers call a failure of scaffolding.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>Zagreus was a protagonist positioned perfectly within the roguelike form. Every run was a teenager sneaking out of the house against his father’s wishes, even though they both knew he would have to come back eventually. Zagreus, like so many teenagers, wanted more, wanted to push up against the limits of possibility, maybe push beyond them, to make things different than they are. And so often he has his hopes dashed, his yearning unfulfilled.</span></p>

 <p><i><span>Hades II</span></i><span>, by contrast, trades that ache for a slogan. Death to Chronos, Death to Chronos, Death to Chronos. The game is full of endless divine chatter that fills the stretches of silence between combat runs, but the world never gets any deeper. Hours of dialogue evaporate as soon as they’re read; nothing sticks. Worse, nothing scars.</span></p>

  <p><span>By the end, the plot resolves neatly enough. Melinoë finally defeats Chronos, but instead of killing him, she sends a message to Zagreus in the past: reach out to him, forgive him, bring him back into the family. Zagreus does. History rewrites itself. Everyone remembers two timelines—one where Chronos was cruel and one where he was kind—and they choose to believe the gentler one. Melinoë gains not only the family in the painting but also the grandfather she was trained to destroy. Then, without fanfare, she sets off to repeat the cycle in “other timelines.”&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>It’s clean. Complete. A conclusion stated instead of learned.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>Because </span><i><span>Hades II </span></i><span>is a Rites of Passage story that forgets to include the passage.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>A Rites of Passage story</span><i><span>, </span></i><span>for the uninitiated, always begins with a life problem—something unavoidable and existential. Growing up, forgiving, grieving, learning how to stay. The wrong way to face it is denial; the right way is acceptance. The beauty of the genre lies in watching someone resist change until they can’t anymore.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><span>If we consider another story in this genre, like Judy Blume’s widely beloved 1970 novel </span><i><span>Are You There God? It’s Me, Margaret</span></i><span>, we can better understand </span><i><span>Hades II</span></i><span>. Margaret’s life problem is becoming herself. She is learning what it means to inhabit a changing body, a changing faith, and a changing world. Her wrong way is through control. She prays for time to move faster, for life to just happen already. The hard truth she must accept is that time will go on with or without her permission.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>Meanwhile, in Stephen Chbosky’s </span><i><span>The Perks of Being a Wallflower</span></i><span>, Charlie’s life problem is trauma. His wrong way is silence—the belief that not remembering will keep him safe. His catharsis comes when he finally recalls the truth and survives it. Both stories build empathy through resistance. We ache as their denial collapses because we’ve been with them through the denial.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <figure id="attachment_2000628068" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000628068"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000628068">©</figcaption></figure> <p><i><span>Hades II </span></i><span>has the same ingredients but none of the impact. Melinoë’s life problem is being born into revenge. Her wrong way is living by it. Her hard truth is that forgiveness ends the cycle. But the game skips the middle act. Where is the resistance? Melinoë never fails because of her flaw. Her vengeance doesn’t cost her anything. No friends lost, no cracks in her resolve, no moment where the loop itself becomes unbearable. She doubts only in fleeting dialogue, never in action. Her transformation happens underneath a run of combat indistinguishable from the last.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>Without the wrong way, there’s no reason to crave the right one.</span></p> <p><span>The roguelike loop doesn’t stall Melinoë’s growth. It always rewards her for embracing it. Every run makes her faster, or stronger, or more resilient. “Death to Chronos” is not a curse, but an endless battery. The game trains us to believe and give into what it should have taught us to question: Death to Chronos.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>There’s one moment that could have broken the pattern. Late in the game, Melinoë learns that her mentor, Hecate, is an older version of herself—a Melinoë from another timeline who succeeded in killing Chronos but lost herself in the process. Her personhood sanded down until she’s just the witch who trains the next one.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><span>The two speak in soft circles. There has never been meaningful friction between them and there won’t be today. Melinoë insists, </span><i><span>“</span></i><span>You are my mother.</span><i><span>” </span></i><span>Hecate replies, </span><i><span>“</span></i><span>I am not</span><i><span>.” </span></i><span>When it’s over, they agree, </span><i><span>“</span></i><span>Let’s pretend none of this transpired</span><i><span>.” </span></i><span>And nothing changes. Melinoë loves her just the same. The revelation is a gift to the audience, not the character. We’re handed a twist, a piece of trivia, not a destabilizing truth. I feel nothing.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>Are we meant to believe the passage occurs here? That painful transformation is proven by one version of Melinoë living on under another name, sustained only by this timeline’s necessity? This version, like our unyielding allegiance to “Death to Chronos,” exists not to change the story, but to make its ending possible. Hecate had to be here. She is the proof of what the game can’t admit—that something must break for time to move forward, but </span><i><span>Hades II </span></i><span>refuses to break </span><i><span>our </span></i><span>Melinoë at all.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><i><span>Hades II </span></i><span>is afraid of its own premise. A Rites of Passage story demands stillness, loss, change, and this roguelike cannot abide. The game talks about ending cycles while mechanically refusing to stop spinning.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>When I play, the only emotions I feel belong to the combat: the thrill of a build working out just how I imagined, the delight of a particularly rare boon appearing when I need it, the visceral pleasure of clearing a room without ever being touched. When the credits eventually roll, I’ve learned nothing. I haven’t learned anything about Melinoë, or about myself, or about existence. Zagreus saves Chronos, everyone remembers a better time, and Melinoë sets off to fix other timelines. </span><i><span>Hades II </span></i><span>isn’t a story. It’s maintenance.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><span>So I wake up again, in that corner of the Crossroads, and stare at the painting. Melinoë, the not-yet-formed person she was. The family she was promised.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><i><span>“</span></i><span>You don’t remember them, besides this painting and your dreams. But still you fight for them…</span><i><span>”&nbsp;</span></i></p> <p><span>After brooding for too long, she sometimes covers the painting with a cloth. I understand now. Some dreams stop meaning something the moment you wake up.</span></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><span>You probably heard the big news about </span><i><span>Grand Theft Auto 6</span></i><span> last week: Rockstar’s open-world crime drama </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/gta-6-grand-theft-auto-vi-delayed-november-rockstar-games-2000641787"><span>has been delayed until November of next year</span></a><span>. However, that wasn’t the only major </span><i><span>GTA 6</span></i><span>-related bomb that dropped. The studio also </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/gta-6-rockstar-games-union-busting-delay-2000640525"><span>fired a few dozen workers</span></a><span> for “gross misconduct,” including what Rockstar claims was </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/gta-6-leaks-delay-developers-fired-rockstar-games-union-2000641525"><span>the public leaking of company secrets</span></a><span>. Now, the affected developers are organizing with in-person protests, and preparing for a possible legal battle if Rockstar doesn’t reinstate their jobs.</span></p>

 <p><span>All of these developers were part of a growing attempt to unionize within the company’s UK branch where reportedly just over 10 percent of the studio’s workforce had been recruited, which would qualify the Rockstar workers there for “statutory recognition,” requiring the company to recognize the union.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><span>Despite what the developers and IWGB Game Workers Union are calling an attempt at union-busting, the dozens of employees affected still want to go back to Rockstar to finish their work on </span><i><span>GTA 6</span></i><span>, and depending on how the company responds, it could lead to a lengthy legal battle. The workers have been picketing outside Rockstar and publisher Take-Two’s offices, with footage from the demonstrations showing they aren’t backing down from the fight.</span></p>

 <h2><b>Fired </b><b><i>GTA 6 </i></b><b>devs just want to get back to work</b></h2> <p><span>YouTube channel </span><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9nOwjeznjI"><span><em>People</em></span><i><span> Make Games</span></i></a> <span>was on the ground at one of the picket lines and interviewed some of the affected workers about the questionable circumstances regarding their termination, the culture of fear that current employees feel after these firings, and the underlying desire to reunite with their colleagues to bring </span><i><span>Grand Theft Auto 6 </span></i><span>over the finish line after years of work.</span></p>

  <p><span>Thus far, the union has put in an appeal for Rockstar to voluntarily reinstate the workers it fired, but if that doesn’t happen, the issue could escalate into a legal battle.</span></p>

 <p><span>“What happens next is up to Rockstar,” IWGB organizer Fred Carter told </span><i><span>People Make Games</span></i><span> last week. “We’ve just submitted our legal claim. The ball is in their court to respond. We hope they’ll resolve this with us amicably. This is<!--StartFragment --><span>—</span><!--EndFragment -->in the end, this is egregious, and to be honest, shocking. I have never seen a thing like this, not just in the game sector, but in UK trade union organizing in the last 20 years. This is the moment where they can make that right. These are workers who just want to go back to work, to work on a game that they love. If they don’t, they’ve seen what they have to contend with.”</span></p>

 <p><span>Rockstar’s official stance on the issue is that the developers were “distributing and discussing confidential information in a public forum,” and that these firings were “in no way related to people’s right to join a union or engage in union activities.” The only place </span><i><span>GTA 6 </span></i><span>developers say they were discussing anything about the company was on a private Discord server where members of the union spoke about working conditions at the </span><i><span>GTA </span></i><span>company and organized union-based activities. Rockstar declined to comment when </span><i><span>People Make Games </span></i><span>asked if this server was the “public forum” the company referred to, but according to IWGB president Alex Marshall, the conversations should have been protected by British Trade Union legislation.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><span>“It looks like they’re essentially trying to decapitate the union when they see it’s gathering momentum, when they see it’s kind of passing this 10-percent threshold, when they can see it’s picking up,” Marshall told </span><i><span>People Make Games</span></i><span>. “And instead of actually thinking, ‘Oh, our workers are unionizing. Clearly, there’s something we should engage with,’ they’ve just tried to steamroll it, and completely gut the company of a union so they can continue with the behaviors that we’ve seen have been deeply problematic and toxic, and were the exact reason why workers started unionizing. I think what Rockstar has done is just proven, out in the open, what the workers were actually trying to counter behind closed doors.”</span></p> <h2><b>A fight for the soul of Rockstar</b></h2> <p><span>In addition to the ongoing protests, the firings could also be a huge hit to the morale of people at Rockstar still working on </span><i><span>GTA 6</span></i><span>. One anonymous former employee told </span><a href="https://aftermath.site/grand-theft-auto-vi-delay-union-protest-rockstar/"><i><span>Aftermath</span></i></a><span> that losing people in the game’s final development year could have catastrophic consequences for the team, but knowing that many people still in the company are on their side has been heartening.</span></p> <p><span>“It’s heartwarming to see so many of our colleagues supporting us and holding management to account,” they told </span><i><span>Aftermath</span></i><span>. “It’s clear to everyone close to this situation that this is a blatant, unapologetic act of vicious union busting. Rockstar employs so many talented game developers, all of whom are crucial to making the games we put out.”</span></p>

 <p><span>The most raw account we’ve gotten of these events has come from an anonymous Rockstar employee on the </span><a href="https://gtaforums.com/topic/1004182-rockstar-games-alleged-union-busting/#comment-1072605777"><span>GTA Forums website</span></a><span>. The worker, whose identity the site’s moderators say they verified, described a very brief and dehumanizing firing process, one that didn’t offer any evidence or specifics of the supposed “gross misconduct.”</span></p> <p><span>“Those of us who are lucky and remain for now work in fear,” they wrote last week. “Fearful when talking to each other at the tea prep, fearful that we’re next in line and are easily got rid of, too scared to go outside the studio and talk to (or even acknowledge) our colleagues outside protesting in fear of reprisals. Morale in the studio is at rock bottom.”</span></p>

 <p><span>They continued,&nbsp;</span></p> <blockquote><p><span>When we should be excited about what’s to come over the next year, we are now totally deflated, and our trust and confidence in others is totally shot. Which is the truly heartbreaking part, as for us in the Union, all of our ambition was to make Rockstar a happier, fairer, safer, and more equitable place. That’s all. What has happened clearly shows that we care more about the well-being of our colleagues at Rockstar than the Company does. The union remains unbowed and is fighting to win the reinstatement of every dismissed member of staff at Rockstar through legal means and campaigning. This fight is critical; if Rockstar can get away with this, they will keep treating their workers with disdain, disrespect, and subjecting them to continued illegal treatment.</span></p></blockquote> <p><span>Whatever happens, </span><i><span>GTA 6 </span></i><span>has at least another year of development to go before it launches on PC, PS5, and Xbox Series X/S on November 19, 2026. According to industry </span><a href="https://x.com/kiwitalkz/status/1985132691206135905"><span>insider Kiwi Talkz</span></a><span>, the game is content complete and just needs additional polish to avoid a “</span><i><span>Cyberpunk 2077</span></i><span>” situation. </span><i><span>Insider Gaming</span></i><span>’s Tom Henderson </span><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aiosAignxbM&amp;source_ve_path=MTc4NDI0"><span>reports</span></a><span> that the game’s latest delay could cost an estimated $60 million more in development costs.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>But the fight to reinstate the fired developers goes beyond a single game. If Rockstar doesn’t reinstate them, IWGB Game Workers Union co-founder Austin Kelmore tells </span><i><span>Aftermath </span></i><span>the organization “intends to pursue every legal avenue available” to get these developers their jobs back. The larger ramifications this will have on Rockstar and its public perception won’t stop at the launch of </span><i><span>GTA 6 </span></i><span>next year. </span></p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/proceeds-from-battlefield-6s-veterans-day-pack-dont-directly-benefit-vets-2000643014</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/proceeds-from-battlefield-6%E2%80%B2s-veterans-day-pack-don%E2%80%99t-directly-benefit-vets.1350307/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>To celebrate Veterans Day in the United States, EA has teamed up with the veterans’ charity group <a href="https://www.nationalrgrassociation.com/">National Ranger Association</a>&nbsp;and released a new cosmetic bundle in <a href="https://kotaku.com/battlefield-6-review-steam-ps5-campaign-multiplayer-2000633379"><em>Battlefield 6</em></a> honoring Army Rangers. It looks a lot like a charity bundle, but some fine print makes it clear that’s not the case, as none of the proceeds from sales of the new pack are being donated to the veteran charity group.</p>

 <p>On November 11, EA released the “Lead the Way” cosmetic bundle in its hit multiplayer FPS<em> Battlefield 6.</em> The pack costs $12 and includes gear inspired by Army Rangers, including a new weapon skin, character outfit, and camo parachute. It’s a pretty grounded, realistic cosmetic pack, <a href="https://kotaku.com/new-battlefield-6-skin-is-causing-community-meltdown-grounded-ea-2000638294">the kind of thing<em> Battlefield 6</em> fans love.</a> And if you head over to the<em> Battlefield 6</em> store online, <a href="https://store.ea.com/battlefield/en/bundle/lead-the-way-pack">you’ll see a preview image with text that states</a>: “Join <em>Battlefield</em> in our support of the National Ranger Association.” That seems to imply this is a charity pack, and the store listing’s most prominent text does nothing to indicate otherwise. But if you scroll down far enough, in small text, you’ll find that EA clarifies that the “Lead the Way” pack isn’t directly supporting vets.</p>

 <blockquote><p>“No portion of the Lead The Way pack sales is donated.”</p></blockquote> <p>Now, to be clear, EA did explain this pack isn’t benefiting vets more directly <a href="https://www.ea.com/en/games/battlefield/battlefield-6/news/veterans-day-lead-the-way-pack">in a blog post on Monday</a>. In that article, EA explained that this isn’t a charity pack way at the bottom of the post. Here’s the text included:</p> <blockquote><p>While proceeds of the Lead the Way Pack are not allocated to charity, our independent donation to the National Ranger Association helps advance their important work for the Ranger community. We encourage you to learn more at their website and consider supporting their mission.</p></blockquote> <p>Still, it’s very strange to obfuscate the fact that this pack, which looks a lot like a bundle dedicated to supporting real-life vets, won’t directly benefit those people. <em>Kotaku</em> contacted EA and Battlefield Studios about the bundle and donation, but didn’t receive a response.</p> <p>Sure, EA donated money independently to the group and is sponsoring the charity’s “Best Ranger Competition.” That’s nice and all, but it seems a bit scummy to sell a Veterans’ Day cosmetic pack that is directly connected to a charity organization, but not make it extremely clear that the proceeds aren’t going to that group or toward helping its mission. Compare this to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Call_of_Duty_Endowment#Funding">Activision’s<em> Call of Duty</em> Endowment organization,</a> which sells cosmetics in-game to support vets finding new jobs after service and donates 100 percent of the proceeds to the group, and it makes EA’s bundle seem much worse.</p>

              <p>As&nbsp;<a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-tcg-prismatic-evolutions-surging-sparks-sold-1851738920"><em>Kotaku</em> has been reporting for the whole year</a>, the&nbsp;<em>Pokémon Trading Card Game</em> has been in a crisis from which it’s showing no signs of recovery. As new card prices hit record highs, it naturally draws in many new collectors hoping to hit it big, which causes scalpers to swoop in to drive up scarcity and prices, attracting more new collectors, then more scalpers, and so on, a vicious circle that is increasingly tightening, strangling the hobby. This situation has now reached a spectacular new low, with reports that people are attempting to sell the Mega Gengar ex special art rare card from <em>PTCG</em> set Mega Dream ex for $800. But there’s a small problem: the card doesn’t exist yet. It’s set to be part of Japan’s Mega Dream ex special set, only officially announced on Friday, which doesn’t go on sale until November 28.</p>

 <p>Despite <a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-tcg-cards-available-journey-together-stock-1851772771">multiple promises throughout 2025 from The Pokémon Company</a>, it remains the case that it’s close to impossible to walk into either a specialist or mainstream store and buy a pack of <em>Pokémon&nbsp;</em>cards released in the last 12 months. Since November 2024’s pre-orders began for the Eevee-themed <a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-tcg-prismatic-evolutions-pull-rates-rares-1851742071">Prismatic Evolutions</a>, new sets have sold out before human beings can click on sites to buy them, while <a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-tcg-scalpers-mega-evolution-tiktok-2000638182">stock in stores has been stripped from shelves by camping scalpers</a> before kids can spend their allowance. The only solution is to outprint the demand, but as yet The Pokémon Company has demonstrated that it either can’t or won’t do this, and in fact <a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-tcg-mega-evolution-gold-cards-pull-rate-2000630564">seems to be going out of its way to make the situation far worse</a>. And following on from the gold card fiasco of Mega Evolutions, the latest English-language set that goes on sale November 14—Phantasmal Flames—ups this ante by including a single gold card, and having it be the most desired Pokémon on cardboard, Mega Charizard. It’s going to be&nbsp;<em>crazy</em>.</p>

 <p>But if there’s one card that could potentially prove more popular than Mega Charizard ex (which is also getting a Special Illustration Rare version that will inevitably fetch more than $500), it’s Mega Gengar ex, and that ghostly beast is appearing in&nbsp; Japan’s Mega Dream ex later this month. And as reported by <a href="https://www.wargamer.com/pokemon-trading-card-game/mega-gengar-ex-240-pre-sale"><em>Wargamer</em></a> (thanks&nbsp;<a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/card-games/weve-reached-unprecedented-levels-of-cooked-the-mega-gengar-pokemon-tcg-is-selling-for-usd800-even-though-it-doesnt-actually-exist-yet/"><em>PC Gamer</em></a>), people are <a href="https://www.ebay.com/itm/397243002072?_skw=Mega+Gengar+ex+%23240%2F193&amp;itmmeta=01K9PPMWXCK456FFJQCCGRDSZG&amp;hash=item5c7d872cd8:g:T~kAAeSwdQlpD~Dz&amp;itmprp=enc%3AAQAKAAAA0FkggFvd1GGDu0w3yXCmi1dNIO%2F55w8M20oPYIKOiRGJYfOPTDZbfsqACeI0yA58V9SgTbGZAjx5jzskijh0KLARlhOnqiyoxGbOxSSqCge0%2Fc0KZ51o9SqnbF%2FvDvkeODnztPa3GHAB%2BdPoLIll6UNOAteF9UtmUl1DdKYKfJ4sEn%2BqZ68kmmWn5CgG5Q40dXRGfJwlfFbSfRUxLH6Lo8fGHPhuzdakr%2Bec9lHbZ3BGZaeMOv9DjJbMFexcO2HnxbjHI2M48amPrcvzaMFjiIk%3D%7Ctkp%3ABk9SR-bO09bNZg">already putting the card up for sale on eBay</a>. For $797.99.</p>

 <figure id="attachment_2000643010" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000643010"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000643010">© eBay / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p>To be clear, even though you will see American YouTubers ripping open packs of international cards long before their street dates (either because they are sent samples by TPCi, as we are, or because they get retail stock ahead of sale), this isn’t the case for the Japanese sets. No one has these cards yet. The art for the Mega Gengar ex Special Art Rare was only revealed digitally on Friday. Then cut and pasted onto eBay with a price tag.</p>

 <p>Japan is having all the same problems with stock as the rest of the world, such that even physical Pokémon Centers over there are—I’ve been told—limiting customers to four single packs each. Scalpers will likely be abusing retail options to get hold of the booster boxes, stripping them down to resell valuable cards, and then dumping the bulk. That’s how someone could be confident enough to believe they can honor a sale of a card that is probably still in production right now.</p>

 <p>Presumably the only thing stopping people from trying to hawk copies of the English version of the Mega Gengar ex is that they haven’t got an image of it yet. It will likely be included in whatever January’s special set of Pokémon cards proves to be, and guarantees that this tiresome situation will drag on into at least the start of 2026. It’s a bubble, and it <em>will</em> burst, but the concern is just how much harm it will have done by that point. Not only is <a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-magic-the-gathering-scalpers-cards-2000632017">an entire generation of children being excluded from the hobby</a> (and thus from becoming the next generation of collectors), but it’s having a real-life impact on specialist card stores. Store owners are telling me they’re unable to get stock, and that TPCi is actively refusing to engage with them about the issues, meaning customers aren’t coming in. One store owner told me he’s resorted to getting up in the early hours of the morning to try to buy packs online from other retailers, just so he has something to sell on his shelves, while knowing he’s driving the problem by doing so. It’s miserable.</p> <p>So, don’t buy from these scalpers. Don’t endorse those selling sealed product at double or triple the MSRP. Refusing to participate is the only action we can take to address the situation, and thinking, “Well everyone else is doing it, so…” makes you part of the problem. Yes, it’d sure be great to pull that gold Mega Charizard—it could pay for a vacation—but you most likely won’t. (The pull rates for one of the Mega Evolution golds were one in every 2,250 packs, ffs.) Oh, and especially don’t buy from people claiming to sell you a card that’s not even printed yet.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/ps5-pro-review-one-year-later-worth-it-price-4k-games-2000642988</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/one-year-later-i%E2%80%99ve-forgotten-i-even-own-a-ps5-pro.1350178/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>One year ago this week, Sony launched one of its most expensive video game consoles ever: <a href="https://kotaku.com/ps5-pro-playstation-unboxing-inside-review-comparison-1851688605">the PlayStation 5 Pro</a>. The company promised improved performance and visuals over the standard PS5 as well as DLSS-like upscaling. And while some games definitely benefit from the power, I’ve mostly forgotten I even own a PS5 Pro.</p>

 <p>When Sony announced the PlayStation 5 Pro last year, it received a mixed reception. While some were excited to have a more powerful console that could run games at higher framerates, many weren’t convinced it was necessary.<a href="https://kotaku.com/ps5-pro-price-specs-release-date-sony-preorder-1851644442"> And then Sony showed everyone the $700 price tag</a>, and it became even harder to justify the new console. But despite all that, I was still excited to get a PS5 Pro. I have a big ol’ 4K TV and I care about framerates and all the minutiae that impacts how a game looks. And over the last year, I’ve enjoyed some great games on my PS5 Pro. <em>Battlefield 6,</em> for example, looks and runs wonderfully on Sony’s beefier machine. Likewise, <em>Death Stranding 2</em> looks incredibly sharp on PS5 Pro while still running flawlessly.</p>

 <p>Yet, many other games I play on my PS5 Pro either don’t look or feel noticeably better, or feature no improvements at all. It doesn’t help that the PlayStation Store still lacks detailed information about what PS5 Pro enhancements are included in a given game. Sometimes I have to go digging around online to find a blog or Reddit post to determine what, if anything, has changed because I’m playing a game on PS5 Pro. That’s not a great experience for a console that now <a href="https://kotaku.com/ps5-console-price-increase-sony-america-august-21-2000618873">costs $750.</a></p>

 <p>I can confirm that after a year of use, the PS5 Pro hasn’t given me any troubles. It runs quietly, still feels snappy to use, and hasn’t broken in some other way. In comparison, my base PS5’s USB-C port stopped working after just a few weeks. So at the very least, the PS5 Pro seems well-built and sturdy, which is nice, I guess. But is all of that worth $750?</p>

 <h2>Should you buy a PS5 Pro in 2025?</h2> <p>After using the PS5 Pro for a year, I find it hard to recommend. While I do think there are some people out there who will get some benefit from owning a PS5 Pro–<a href="https://kotaku.com/ps5-pro-who-is-it-for-review-worth-it-impressions-4k60-1851691112">mainly folks with 4KTVs who really care about performance</a>–most people don’t need Sony’s more powerful console. Heck, I’m a bit of a graphics snob who loves running games at 120FPS, and I often forget the PS5 Pro is sitting in front of me because games so rarely feel like they’re benefiting from its enhanced specs.</p>

 <p>The lack of third-party support is disappointing, too. It’s surprising how many games are still launching on the PS5 via the PlayStation Store without any PS5 Pro benefits. You’d think at this point, Sony would be pushing devs and publishers to support the pricey console more. But it doesn’t feel like that is the case, which I find very strange, and that makes it even harder to recommend plopping down the cash for this thing.</p> <p>At this point, I’d suggest sticking to your PS5 (if you have one) and just enjoying it for a few more years and buying a PlayStation 6 instead when that console finally launches in the next few years, likely at a similar price.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/arc-raiders-hidden-bunker-data-download-trials-2000642994</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/arc-raiders%E2%80%99-hidden-bunker-mystery-might-not-be-so-mysterious.1350148/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>First, I’m telling you to <a href="https://kotaku.com/arc-raiders-ledge-grab-spaceport-exploit-movement-tech-2000642966">stop exploiting the ledge grab</a> in <i>Arc Raiders</i>, and now I’m telling you to stop obsessing over something that probably isn’t worth your attention. Sorry to be “mom” here, but I’m pretty sure the Hidden Bunker mystery in Spaceport isn’t really a mystery at all.</p>

 <p><b>Read More:</b> <a href="https://kotaku.com/arc-raiders-ledge-grab-spaceport-exploit-movement-tech-2000642966"><i>Arc Raiders</i>’ Ledge Grab Exploit Is Bad, Actually</a></p> <p>Each map in <i>Arc Raiders</i> will see various timed events come and go. Some just see the map swapped over to a night theme, while others have dangerous electrical storms. Most recently, a mysterious hidden bunker underneath the Spaceport map was thrown into the rotation. It works like this: After an activation sequence on the surface, players can explore the corridors beneath the map to find some decent loot as well as some computer terminals to download data from. You get 500XP for downloading the data, and earn progress on your weekly Trials, but not much else happens. Fans, however, are not convinced that’s all there is to it (<a href="https://www.dexerto.com/gaming/arc-raiders-new-hidden-bunker-puzzle-has-players-completely-stumped-3281779/">h/t <i>Dexerto</i></a>).</p>

 <p>As <a href="https://youtu.be/yhQIigWZcZ4">documented by YouTuber The Gaming Merchant</a>, downloading the data in the Hidden Bunker <i>feels</i> like it should make something happen somewhere else or deeper in the Bunker, or like it’s part of a larger puzzle. You press a button, a meter fills up, a light turns green and you get XP, but if you walk away without doing this, the light turns red. There are multiple computer terminals that do this within the Bunker, which has led some to believe that they all either need to be activated at the exact same time or in some unknown sequence. There are more terminals than players the game allows for in a single party, so you’d have to gather together a bunch of randos to fully exhaust the options here, but I’m pretty sure that earning XP and making progress on your Trials is the whole point here: Activate the terminals and defend the room until they’re finished downloading.</p>

 <p>Downloading the data is not as easy as just flipping a switch and walking away. <a href="https://youtu.be/2oTiy1D6l6Q">Gamers Heroes’ video on the Hidden Bunker</a> documents this well. There’s a bit of <i>Siege</i>-esque Defend-The-Room™ required as the Hidden Bunker is likely to be swarming with players looking for other loot.</p>

  <p>Do this successfully, and you earn three stars in your Trials progress.</p> <h2>Is there a secret beneath the Spaceport?</h2> <p>Some folks are not convinced the XP and Trials progress is the point here. They’re running around trying to crack sequences they think exist, or they’re trying to activate them all at the same time, but to no avail.</p>

 <p>Honestly, I think too many folks still have their spinfoil hats on from <i>Destiny</i>.</p> <p>A megathread on the game’s subreddit is presently documenting some <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ArcRaiders/comments/1orwml1/comment/no81af1/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button">borderline Charlie-Day-meme</a> <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ArcRaiders/comments/1orwml1/comment/no379fo/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button">theory crafting</a> about what’s going on here.</p>

   <p>The biggest piece of evidence, in my opinion, that there’s no <i>there there</i> is in a lone comment indicating that the download progress of each computer is different for each player, which would mean it’s a different instance for players outside of your squad and that timing the downloads is nigh impossible because, well, they’re not designed that way. You get your data, you get your XP, you get your Trials progress. That’s it!</p>

When you download the data, a light on the computer turns green. That light, as it turns out, is the same model as found on <a href="https://kotaku.com/arc-raiders-field-depot-crate-off-radar-down-to-earth-2000642525">Field Depots</a>, of which <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ArcRaiders/comments/1orwml1/comment/no2j64j/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button">there is one sitting right on top of the Hidden Bunker’s location</a>. Another theory concerns the language found on <i>Arc Raiders</i>’ official website describing the event, particularly that “whatever is inside [the Bunker] must be worth the static.” This has folks obsessing over what “static” means.</p> <p>Comments in the megathread indicate that <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ArcRaiders/comments/1orwml1/comment/no2hhan/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button">a variety of attempted solutions</a>, such as downloading everything at the same time, or downloading the data and then <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ArcRaiders/comments/1orwml1/comment/no66rp9/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button">racing to a suspicious location on the map</a>, offer no alternative outcomes. Also, while exploring the Hidden Bunker, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ArcRaiders/comments/1orwml1/comment/no299el/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button">someone managed to fall through the map</a> and, based on their screenshots, there doesn’t appear to be any secret sublayer below. So, various activation methods don’t trigger anything and there don’t appear to be any unlockable portions of the Hidden Bunker.</p> <p>But curious minds aren’t so easily dismayed. Even the fact that the data downloads are <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ArcRaiders/comments/1orwml1/comment/no57p16/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button">required for this week’s Trials</a> has folks suspicious: “I feel like this could either mean that collecting the data for that 500 XP is its own reward,” one reply says, “or this is to incentivize people to run it more and more until someone figures it out.”</p> <p>I think ya had the answer right the first time there.</p> <p>But maybe I’m just a wet blanket of a skeptic as always. I’d like to believe!</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/fortnite-loot-boxes-gambling-roblox-2000642980</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/fortnite-opens-the-loot-box-flood-gates-in-its-race-with-roblox.1350145/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Epic Games ended controversial loot box purchases in<em> Fortnite</em> back in 2019, but it’s bringing them back <a href="https://kotaku.com/fortnite-simpsons-mini-season-review-changes-new-map-short-2000640868">to the battle royale platform</a> as an option for creators in the form of “paid random items.” While there are rules in place about disclosing odds and not targeting minors, loot boxes are essentially back on the menu for the larger <em>Fortnite</em> creator island platform as Epic tries to compete with <em>Roblox</em> for players’ attention and wallets.</p>

 <p>A new developer blog post details Epic’s rules for “<a href="https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/in-island-transactions-restrictions-in-fortnite">In-Island Transactions Restrictions</a>” that will be available in creator islands in the future, including transactions fueled by RNG. “In addition to your responsibility to comply with laws, you must comply with certain restrictions that apply when offering Paid Random Items,” the company, which makes billions a year from microtransactions, writes. “Failure to utilize the functions described below will constitute a violation of Epic policies. ”</p>

 <p>The policies governing how creators can deploy loot boxes in their games are as follows:</p> <ul> <li>Paid Random Items are restricted in Singapore, Qatar, Australia, Netherlands, Belgium, and the UK/Brazil for players under 18 years old.</li> <li>Developers must “disclose the actual numerical odds of what the player may receive before the player makes a purchase.”</li> <li>They must “ensure the language you use relating to transactions is not misleading or overtly pressuring.”</li> <li>They can’t “directly prompt a minor” to buy something.</li> <li>Bundled items in Brazil must be available to purchase individually.</li> </ul> <p>And that’s it. Outside of those restrictions, or any other legal requirements unique to individual countries, <em>Fortnite</em> creators have free rein to design and sell loot boxes however they want. With no shortage of imagination, I’m sure some of them could design very clever and very lucrative systems for both entertaining players and extracting lots of V-Bucks from their virtual wallets.</p>

 <h2>Epic promises it’s not promoting gambling</h2> <p>But Epic Games is adamant that none of this will amount to gambling and that random paid items themselves do not count as such. <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/fortnite-adding-gambling-in-future-update-leaks-reveal/"><em>Insider Gaming</em> reports</a> that the company reached out to the outlet to ask it to remove references to gambling in a recent article covering leaked info about the update, noting that gambling is against <em>Fortnite</em>‘s rules.</p>

 <p>“Don’t implement playable gambling content, raffles, or casino-style games. These are prohibited whether or not they involve real money or virtual currency,” read Epic’s <a href="https://legal.epicgames.com/en-US/fortnite/developer-rules">developer terms of service</a>. “Islands that teach or prominently feature images or activities that are typically associated with real-world gambling, casino style games, or games of chance that offer a prize, even if they are not directly simulating a gambling experience, are not permitted in any form.”</p>

 <p>Epic and other companies have been making this argument about loot boxes <a href="https://kotaku.com/esrb-says-it-doesnt-see-loot-boxes-as-gambling-1819363091">for years</a>, claiming that if odds are disclosed and the items can’t be easily resold for actual money, then they don’t count as gambling, even though they otherwise perfectly mirror the experience of a lottery scratch-off. No matter how you define gambling, though, it’s clear loot boxes are <a href="https://kotaku.com/loot-boxes-are-designed-to-exploit-us-1819457592">designed to exploit people’s psychology</a> to get them to spend money they wouldn’t otherwise part with.</p>

 <h2>The race to keep up with <em>Roblox</em></h2> <p>Why is Epic Games tip-toeing back into a pond that was once so controversial it <a href="https://kotaku.com/u-s-senator-introduces-bill-to-ban-loot-boxes-and-pay-1834612226">led to Congressional hearings and legislative proposals</a>? The most obvious reason is that it’s <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/06/17/arts/grow-garden-roblox-record.htm">currently competing with Roblox</a> to operate the platform of choice for user-generated games and the millions of people who play them. It paid out over $350 million <a href="https://create.fortnite.com/news/fortnite-ecosystem-2024-year-in-review-celebrating-creators-and-looking-ahead?team=personal">to its island creators last year</a>, and announced <a href="https://www.fortnite.com/news/fortnite-developers-will-soon-be-able-to-sell-in-game-items?lang=en-US">plans in September</a> to let them start selling in-game items just like regular <em>Fortnite </em>does.</p>

 <p>Roblox, of course, was already doing this. <em>Grow a Garden</em>, one of its biggest surprise hits with concurrent players peaking at over 22 million, is essentially a farming sim with a daily shop that refreshes and where you can spend Robux on microtransactions to acquire rare seeds or make harvesting more efficient. The game isn’t popular in spite of the pay-to-win mechanics underlying it, but in part because of them. The success of gacha games like <em>Genshin Impact</em> and card pack modes like <em>EA Sports FC</em>‘s Ultimate Team shows this isn’t isolated to UGC games either.</p> <p>Epic is currently trying to beat Roblox with a more generous cut of the profits. <em>Fortnite</em> creators can earn 74 percent of in-game sales through the end of the 2026, after which it will drop down to 37 percent. That’s still substantially more than the cut creators are currently getting at Roblox, which only pays out 25 percent of in-game sales. I’m sure none of this will create perverse incentives for what <em>Fortnite</em> creators make moving forward.</p>
