It’s a hell of a lot bigger and longer, too. So, whether you’re new to the franchise or are diving back in for round two in this exciting universe, you’re probably curious how long it’ll take to finish <em>Revenge of the Savage Planet</em>. </p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="196086" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="The Week In Games: Dark Knights And Dark Princes" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="102" data-playlist="196086,196663,196345" data-current="196086"><div><p>The Week In Games: Dark Knights And Dark Princes</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196086/196086_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196086/196086_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196086/196086_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196086/196086_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/21614.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><h2 id="h17461"><a id=""></a>How long does it take to beat <em>Revenge of the Savage Planet</em>?</h2><p><em>Revenge of the Savage Planet</em> is a very open game that throws a lot of information, quests, and pathways at you in rapid succession. It can sometimes feel a bit overwhelming to know what’s most important to tackle next. But as you acclimate to the game’s pacing and information, you’ll slowly start being able to narrow down what’s most pertinent.</p><p>Once you’ve settled into a groove, you’ll be able to decide whether you want to focus on the main story or go the completionist route. If your goal is the former, <strong>you can expect to spend around 12-15 hours reaching the credits for the main story</strong>. But opting for this path means that you’ll be leaving a lot of fun quests and optional exploration behind.</p><p>If you decide to go for a completionist run of <em>Revenge of the Savage Planet</em>, you’ll get a whole lot more out of the adventure. <strong>A 100% run of the game can net you between 20-25 hours worth of gameplay,</strong> depending on how good you are at sussing out secret areas and well-hidden collectibles.</p><p>And there are a<em> lot </em>of collectibles in <em>Revenge of the Savage Planet</em>. Folks who enjoy searching every nook and cranny for upgrade resources and fun extras will have fun exploring the game’s multiple dense planets. And you’ll need to do a hell of a lot of scanning for research purposes, too.</p><p>As you can see,<em> Revenge of the Savage Planet</em> can keep you pretty busy. If that sounds up your alley, the game is available now on PS5, Xbox Series X/S, and Windows PCs.</p><p>.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

The report notes that a Tarnished Pack DLC will be made available for PS5, PS4, Xbox One, Xbox Series X, and PC, presumably with a price tag in the realm of $10-$20, though FromSoftware hasn’t confirmed that yet. We also don’t know if it will arrive on all platforms at the same time or have a brief staggered release window. <br></p><p>Still, I’m sure the over 30 million players who have already bought <em>Elden Ring</em> will be stoked to know there’s new stuff coming, and while it’s not an entirely new boss or other major piece of content, new classes and items should offer returning players some fun additional tools to experiment with. Somehow I don’t think the open-world RPG has hit its last major milestone. I also don’t think anyone would be put out if FromSoftware decided to keep sneaking out new content here and there, either. </p><p>.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Bungie isn’t saying just yet. The announcement came as a “one more thing” tease at the end of its Year Of Prophecy showcase focused on what the future of its sci-fi MMO shooter looks like, and there’s no information yet on just how closely it will bleed into the actual <em>Star Wars</em> universe, though the team isn’t being shy about the inspiration.<br></p><p>A full reveal will come in September, but for now here’s the initial teaser trailer:</p><p>Bungie said the expansion, which launches before the end of 2025 pending any delays, will take players to a lawless frontier within the <em>Destiny</em> solar system that channels the sci-fi Western style of the<em> Star Wars</em> universe. Presumably there won’t be any actual fictional cross-over, even if Bungie has been known to do plenty of branded collaborations and multiverse references in the past. </p><p>Players already went hands on with their first taste of <em>Star Wars</em> in the world of <em>Destiny</em> <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/star-wars-destiny-2-skins-stormtrooper-empire-price-ps5-1851749688?_gl=1*cve0vj*_ga*MTc0MjY2NTg1OS4xNzQwMzc1OTc4*_ga_V4QNJTT5L0*czE3NDY1NDU2ODEkbzc2JGcxJHQxNzQ2NTQ4ODgyJGo0OSRsMCRoMA..&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/star-wars-destiny-2-skins-stormtrooper-empire-price-ps5-1851749688?_gl=1*cve0vj*_ga*MTc0MjY2NTg1OS4xNzQwMzc1OTc4*_ga_V4QNJTT5L0*czE3NDY1NDU2ODEkbzc2JGcxJHQxNzQ2NTQ4ODgyJGo0OSRsMCRoMA..">a few months back</a></span> when Stormtrooper costumes and other <em>Star Wars</em>-themed cosmetics were put up for sale in the game. Despite their lore-crushing vibes, live-service games have embraced more and more crossovers in recent years, presumably because despite their grumbling, that’s the stuff players are actually willing to spend money on. </p><p>It’ll be interesting to see how an entire expansion like <em>Renegades</em> walks that tightrope. Maybe it’ll remain a strictly <em>Destiny</em> expansion in <em>Star Wars</em> cosplay, or maybe it’s a chance for Bungie to try something completely different now that a decade of storytelling around its Light and Darkness saga is finally wrapped up following last year’s<em> Final Shape</em> climax. <em>Destiny 2</em>'s next expansion, <em>The Edge of Fate</em>, will arrive on July 15 and will likely give players plenty to do in the wait for <em>Renegades</em>.</p><p>.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
