            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>When I started testing headsets on my new Nintendo Switch 2, I dove in from a casual perspective seeking a pleasant experience with pals on GameChat while running some Knockout Tours in <em>Mario Kart World</em>. I’m not an audiophile, after all. I’m just a guy who enjoys an easy-to-use, comfy headset with generally good sound quality and solid battery life. I found a handful of such headsets that I’ve really enjoyed using on my Switch 2, and I’m here to tell you about them. </p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="197565" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="Nintendo Switch 2 Could Launch With Almost No Reviews" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="122" data-playlist="197565,197567,195670" data-current="197565"><div><p>Nintendo Switch 2 Could Launch With Almost No Reviews</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197565/197565_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197565/197565_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197565/197565_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/23089.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p><strong>Note:</strong> Since the Switch 2 doesn’t allow mic input while using Bluetooth, every wireless headset on this list includes a USB dongle that allows for audio output <em>and</em> input. </p><h2 id="h32345"><a id="1"></a>Alienware Pro</h2><p>At $230, the <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.dell.com/en-us/shop/alienware-pro-wireless-gaming-headset/apd/520-bbkn/gaming-gaming-accessories&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.dell.com/en-us/shop/alienware-pro-wireless-gaming-headset/apd/520-bbkn/gaming-gaming-accessories" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Alienware Pro</a></span> is the most expensive headset I tested since the launch of the Switch 2, and I’d argue it’s (mostly) worth the asking price. Its exceptional ANC (Active Noise Cancellation) was miles above other headsets I tried. And it’s easily the most comfortable option in my current collection. Because of this, it’s been one of only two headsets I’ve used consistently since finishing my initial tests.</p><p>I found the Alienware Pro produces a somewhat muffled voice output, which is admittedly disappointing at this price point. But I’ve otherwise loved many of its other offerings, such as its sleek aesthetic, soft and cozy earpads, 70+ hour battery life, and detachable mic. The latter is especially nice, as it allows the Alienware Pro to function as attractive out-and-about headphones, too. </p><h2 id="h32346"><a id="2"></a>Razer BlackShark V2 Pro</h2><p>The <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.razer.com/gaming-headsets/razer-blackshark-v2-pro&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.razer.com/gaming-headsets/razer-blackshark-v2-pro" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Razer BlackShark V2 Pro</a></span> is a $200 option that should appeal to competitive gamers. This award-winning headset is well-liked in the eSports community due to its excellent spatial audio and killer wideband mic that provides some of the clearest voice delivery I’ve ever heard from a headset. With the touch of a button, you can even select useful EQ presets, including a few created by pro players for specific games.</p><p>One of my favorite things about the BlackShark V2 Pro is its helicopter pilot-esque visual style, which gives it an understated vintage vibe that looks unique in an era of “gamery” devices. The fact that it’s so comfortable that I often forgot I was wearing it is also nice. If it only had noise canceling capabilities so I could drown out the sound of my cat summoning demons in the background while I’m getting my ass kicked in <em>Splatoon 3</em>, it’d be basically perfect.</p><h2 id="h32347"><a id="3"></a>Turtle Beach Stealth 700 (Gen 3)</h2><p>The <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.turtlebeach.com/products/stealth-700-gen-3-headset&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.turtlebeach.com/products/stealth-700-gen-3-headset" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Turtle Beach Stealth 700 (Gen 3)</a></span> mostly delivers on its $200 price tag thanks to stellar 60mm dual drivers that offer crisp audio, a cool flip-to-mute mic, phenomenal battery life (up to 80 hours), and sturdy build quality. Admittedly, the high clamp force of the headset occasionally caused minor discomfort after extensive use (4+ hours), but it was never so bad that I felt compelled to take it off. You really shouldn’t wear a headset that long without a break anyway.</p><p>But while the Turtle Beach Stealth 700 (Gen 3) isn’t necessarily the most <em>comfortable</em> headset I’ve used, one feature has kept me coming back: <strong>This bad boy sports two USB dongles out of the box so that you can swap between consoles (or PC) with the touch of a button.</strong> As someone who frequently jumps between PS5 and Switch 2, this is a godsend that keeps me from having to switch out headsets when doing so. Efficiency is king for lazy asses like me.</p><h2 id="h32348"><a id="4"></a>Razer Barracuda X Chroma</h2><p>The <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.razer.com/gaming-headsets/razer-barracuda-x-chroma&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.razer.com/gaming-headsets/razer-barracuda-x-chroma" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Razer Barracuda X Chroma</a></span> sits at a cool $130, which places it in that sweet mid-range spot. And that seems about right for this aesthetically pleasing headset that does pretty much everything well without feeling like it needs to be particularly exceptional at any one thing. It provides great sound and mic quality, an ergonomic fit, and 65-70 hours of battery life that ensures you stay in the game and off the charger. It’s just a good all-arounder for the average user, and that’s a win in my book.</p><p>There’s also a nice selection of RGB customization on the Razer Barracuda X Chroma, though you probably won’t really get to see any of them since the headset is on your head, of course. I appreciate this neat touch for those with a penchant for some fun visual flair, even if it’s not my cup of tea. Just keep in mind that you’ll need to download a companion app to get all of this stuff up and running.</p><h2 id="h32349"><a id="5"></a>OXS Storm G2</h2><p>Landing just above the budget crowd and just below the mid-range selections is the <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://oxsaudio.com/products/oxs-storm-g2?srsltid=AfmBOooo8I9qExR8hLfoYqN8ydpI2S-QfXDEPPUEy0GyGDlwJE37znbh&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://oxsaudio.com/products/oxs-storm-g2?srsltid=AfmBOooo8I9qExR8hLfoYqN8ydpI2S-QfXDEPPUEy0GyGDlwJE37znbh" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">OXS Storm G2</a></span>. And it’s a serviceable $80 headset that I found myself using quite a lot during the first week of owning my Switch 2. This is a good-looking set of cans with a solid sound profile, fairly decent mic quality, and a 40-hour battery life (20ish with RGB lighting turned on). And its lightweight design was so comfortable that I didn’t feel compelled to rip them off after my pals bounced out of GameChat for the night.</p><p>The cheap plastic build quality means you probably shouldn’t be tossing the headset around your game room or letting kids get too happy-go-lucky with it. But seeing as the OXS Storm G2 isn’t trying to fulfill the same promises as premium options, I’d say it’s still a catch at this price point. And I’ve frequently seen it drop down to $60 during sales, making it even more appealing.</p><h2 id="h32350"><a id="6"></a>Turtle Beach Recon 70</h2><p>Coming in at only $40, the <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.turtlebeach.com/products/recon-70-headset&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.turtlebeach.com/products/recon-70-headset" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Turtle Beach Recon 70</a></span> was one of the few wired headsets I tried on my Switch 2, and it was certainly my favorite budget option. I don’t like being tethered to my controller by a wire, so I probably won’t continue using this one, but it’s a satisfyingly low-cost option with sound quality that punches above its weight. Its mic quality is also significantly better than I’d expect from something twice its price.</p><p>Despite being made of plastic, the Turtle Beach Recon 70 is shockingly comfortable and sturdy, too, so I never felt like I had to be too careful with it. And since it plugs into a 3.5mm jack on your controller, there’s very little to fiddle with on the cups themselves. This lack of extra buttons and thingamajigs to keep up with makes this headset exceedingly easy to understand and use for casual players and youngsters alike.</p><p>Though the Switch 2 is still quite young, having only been out for about a month, there are already some great peripherals out there to upgrade your gaming experience.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://kotaku.com/switch-2-best-headsets-alienware-razer-turtle-beach-1851785500]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Unknown Worlds’ <em>Subnautica 2</em> is due to release into early access soon, which makes the news that its development team’s bosses have just been apparently ousted even more shocking.

However, it wasn’t really the “indie” project it sometimes appeared, given that by this point the development studio was majority owned by Chinese publisher Perfect World, based on a valuation of around $3.5 million. In 2019, a year after the release of <em>Subnautica</em>, Perfect World sold off most of its shares, and in 2021 the studio was bought outright by Korean developer Krafton (publishers of mega-hits <em>PUGB </em>and <em>InZoi</em>), which at the time said it would allow Unknown Worlds to continue to operate independently. Clearly, that has now changed.<br></p><p>In <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://krafton.com/en/news/press/krafton-announces-gaming-industry-veteran-steve-papoutsis-as-new-ceo-of-unknown-worlds/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://krafton.com/en/news/press/krafton-announces-gaming-industry-veteran-steve-papoutsis-as-new-ceo-of-unknown-worlds/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">a press release</a></span> put out July 2, Krafton declared that long-time game producer Steve Papoutsis (<em>The Callisto Protocol</em>, <em>Dead Space</em>) has been brought in to be the new CEO of Unknown Worlds, with a goal to “prioritize development momentum and delivering best possible fan experience for [the] long-anticipated <em>Subnautica 2</em> launch.”</p><p>Krafton states that Papoutsis is replacing all three members of the original leadership team, “effective immediately.” The rather combative tone continues:</p><blockquote data-type="BlockQuote"><p>While KRAFTON sought to keep the Unknown Worlds’ co-founders and original creators of the <em>Subnautica</em> series involved in the game’s development, the company wishes them well on their next endeavors.</p></blockquote><p>Not so much reading between the lines as just reading the lines themselves, this gives the impression that Krafton had enough of how long the sequel to the 2018 game was taking, and so fired the company’s founders. We’ve reached out to find out if this is the case. The news has clearly come in fast, given at the time of writing, Ted Gill’s X account still states “CEO of @UnknownWorlds.”</p><p>This time pressure is stressed over and over, including in this statement from Krafton’s CEO, CH Kim. “There is nothing more important than the gamer experience,” he begins. “Given the anticipation around <em>Subnautica 2</em>, we owe our players nothing less than the best possible game, as soon as possible.” There’s <em>nothing more important</em>. The statement then goes on to seemingly just outright chastise the previous team, lecturing the reader:</p><blockquote data-type="BlockQuote"><p> As part of its oversight, KRAFTON is committed to achieving regular milestones to assess progress across its creative studios. These reviews, based on clearly defined metrics and targets, will help ensure that games meet both creative and quality standards. This process is essential to delivering the right game at the right time. Unknown Worlds’ new leadership fully supports this process and is committed to meeting player expectations.</p></blockquote><p>It really is quite something. And that’s fewer than half the times the same press release reiterates the importance of timely development. It’s astonishingly passive-aggressive.</p><p>My guess—and I stress I’m guessing—is that Cleveland et al would have been pushing for a delay before the early access release, and Krafton drew a line in the sand. Which, if true, would be all the more interesting given this isn’t a game that’s publicly slipped; it was initially announced as a 2025 release, and no one would have batted an eye if it was made known it was now sliding into 2026. It’d be fascinating to learn the internal situation that’s led to this apparent coup d’état.</p><p><em>Subnautica</em> was a sublime game (albeit with <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/subnautica-dev-fired-over-hateful-statements-1822746373&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/subnautica-dev-fired-over-hateful-statements-1822746373">its own controversial firings</a></span>), and will be a hard act to follow. Rumors that the sequel was going to be a multiplayer live-service thing caused a ferocious response, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/is-subnautica-2-live-service-krafton-release-date-1851240327&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/is-subnautica-2-live-service-krafton-release-date-1851240327">rapidly quashed by Unknown Worlds</a></span>. Hopefully we’ll still get a chance to play a not-quite-finished version of the game via early access some time this year.</p><p>.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://kotaku.com/subnautica-2-unknown-worlds-krafton-early-access-fired-1851785479]]></content:encoded>

It will also likely be the cornerstone of a long-threatened push to launch its own app store on smartphones following anti-trust losses by Apple and Google. </p><p>The current wave of mass layoffs hitting Xbox follows multiple other rounds that Microsoft has implemented in the wake of its gaming acquisition spree. Nearly 2,000 staff across the gaming division were cut in January 2024, followed by the closures of critically acclaimed studios like Tango Gameworks and Arkane Austin in May. Around 600 more layoffs followed in September, with Microsoft saying at the time that no games were canceled as a result of that round of cuts. </p><p>That’s unlikely to be the case this time around, with the full extent of the culling rumored to potentially include entire studios. Microsoft’s expansive portfolio of game development teams includes ones like Obsidian Entertainment which have prodigiously shipped almost half a dozen games since being bought, as well as others like Undead Labs which have spent years working on sequels that have yet to materialize. Xbox has also been retreating from its console hardware business amidst reported pressure to improve its bottom line, leading to major first-party exclusives like <em>Sea of Thieves</em> and <em>Gears of War </em>going multiplatform on PlayStation 5.</p><p> “We’re accountable to Microsoft for running a good business, a healthy business that continues to grow at both top line and bottom line,” Spencer <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mw26FdfkUDM&amp;list=PL0il2l-B_WwapNQtqa4Fr75ozqe3vHIQi&amp;index=3&amp;t=144s&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mw26FdfkUDM&amp;list=PL0il2l-B_WwapNQtqa4Fr75ozqe3vHIQi&amp;index=3&amp;t=144s" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">said at Summer Game Fest in June</a></span>, hinting at the current upheaval. “That’s kind of a foundation for us. And what that does is it allows us to continue to invest in Xbox for our community of players and creators and that we’re doing it. It does mean we have to make trade-offs through the year on things that we’re going to invest more in, things that we’re not going to invest as much in because...we are the business that we are.” </p><p>.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://kotaku.com/latest-round-of-mass-layoffs-at-xbox-begin-with-200-job-1851785492]]></content:encoded>
