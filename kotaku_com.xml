            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/highguard-launch-pc-ps5-free-to-play-servers-is-it-good-titanfall-apex-2000663135"><em>Highguard</em> is out on PS5, Xbox, and PC</a> and it’s been a weird day for the unique new hero shooter. There were <a href="https://kotaku.com/drdisrespect-lies-about-being-invited-to-highguard-preview-event-2000663184">false claims</a> it had worked with disgraced streamer DrDisrespect and a myriad of technical issues plaguing its first hours on Steam. Now, as the dust settles, <em>Highguard</em> has racked up over 9,000 reviews on Valve’s storefront, but the vast majority are negative.</p> <p>On January 26, after a period of radio silence <a href="https://kotaku.com/highguard-game-awards-trailer-rust-hero-shooter-interview-2000663137">following its reveal at the 2025 Game Awards</a>, <em>Highguard</em> launched for free, offering players a 3v3 PVP “raid shooter” experience complete with destructible environments and cool mounts to ride into battle on. However, shortly after the game’s launch, players began reporting problems. One of the first was that many, myself included, couldn’t even play <em>Highguard</em> due to the overwhelmed servers. Far from the worst issue to have on launch day.</p>

 <p>Once players got in, many reported performance issues on PC, with rigs equipped with high-end hardware still struggling to play <em>Highguard</em> at a steady framerate. And after getting through all that, some players have found matches in <em>Highguard</em> boring and slow, complaining that the 3v3 format and large map don’t mix well. Sprinkle in some bad-faith users attacking the game for looking “woke,” whatever the hell that means, and you end up with a horrible Steam review rating.</p> <h2>What is <em>Highguard’s</em> Steam review rating?</h2> <p>As of 5:10 p.m. EST, <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/4128260/Highguard/#app_reviews_hash"><em>Highguard</em> has 9,442 user reviews on Steam</a> across all languages. Of those nearly 10,000 reviews, <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/4128260/charts/#:~:text=19.8%25%20positive%20reviews-,7%2C230,-80.2%25%20negative%20reviews">SteamDB data shows 7,230 of them are negative</a>. This adds up to a “Mostly Negative” status on Steam with fewer than 2,000 positive reviews. Ouch. <a href="https://store.playstation.com/en-us/concept/10012011">Over on the PlayStation Store,</a> things are better, with <em>Highguard</em> sitting at nearly 2,000 reviews and a 3.34 out of 5-star rating.</p>

 <p>It might be easy to assume this is some nefarious review bombing, and I do think <em>some</em> of this can be <a href="https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=highguard+woke">blamed on bad actors and annoying chuds</a>. But scrolling through the reviews does show a lot of players just don’t seem to like the slow pace of the game and the 3v3 format.</p>

 <p>“The maps in this game are way too big for 3v3; the size would fit better for 5v5 or 6v6,” posted one Steam reviewer. “In the looting stage, the map is too big and empty considering it’s only 3v3, and the only things in it are red and blue chests (and the crystals i guess),” shared another user. “The 3v3 format on such a huge map just doesn’t click for me, and the overall experience becomes chaotic without bringing anything new to the table,” said someone else.</p> <p>Of course, it should be noted that not even 12 hours have passed since <em>Highguard’s</em> launch. So all of these reviews are based on a dozen or so matches or less. The real question will be what happens in the next few days, weeks, and months–assuming <em>Highguard</em> sticks around that long–and if the devs can turn the ship around.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/escape-tarkov-ai-chatbot-quest-ai-chatgpt-2000663213</link>
            <guid>1416913</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><span>You are not immune to AI psychosis. Much like cult indoctrination, it can happen to anyone given the right circumstances. Take Matthew Gault, games and tech writer at </span><i><span>404 Media</span></i><span>. After failing to convince his friends to play </span><i><span>Escape from Tarkov</span></i><span> with him, Gault thought it would be funny to </span><a href="https://www.404media.co/i-replaced-my-friends-with-ai-because-they-wont-play-tarkov-with-me/"><span>replace his buddies with an AI chatbot</span></a><span>. It ended up not being very funny at all.</span></p> <p><span>Gault is a self-described “certified AI hater,” though he concedes that LLM technology is useful in certain instances (I agree to disagree with Gault’s assertion that offloading transcription to an environmentally catastrophic machine built on stolen labor saves valuable time and energy). Gault’s friends were turned off by the difficulty of </span><i><span>Escape from Tarkov</span></i><span>, an extraction shooter which came out of early access last November. He described playing by himself as lonely. “Then I saw comic artist Zach Weinersmith making fun of a service, Questie.AI, that sells AI avatars that’ll hang out with you while you play video games,” he writes.</span></p>

 <p><span>What started as a joke quickly became more sincere. Gault found he genuinely enjoyed playing </span><i><span>Tarkov</span></i><span> with his Quest.AI companion, Wolf. “It was, I thought, not unlike playing with a friend who has more than 1,000 hours in the game and knows more than you. Wolf bantered, referenced community in-jokes, and it made me laugh.”</span></p> <p><span>Gault was surprised and concerned by his own enjoyment of the chatbot, his previous confusion over how people could fall victim to AI psychosis replaced by understanding. He states he will not continue using Quest.AI: “I never thought anything like [AI psychosis] could happen to me. Now I’m not so sure. I didn’t understand how easy it might be to lose yourself to AI delusion until I’d messed around with Wolf. Even with its shitty auto-tuned sounding voice, Wolf was good enough to hang out with.”</span></p>

 <p><span>Gault’s experiment ended with his real friends making fun of him for using Quest.AI by ironically using another LLM, ChatGPT, to send messages to him. Gault’s account is another entry in the emerging genre of seemingly normal people jokingly using AI chatbots and discovering things can get weird very quickly. YouTuber Eddy Burback popularized the phenomenon with his chilling </span><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRjgNgJms3Q"><span>documentary</span></a><span> “ChatGPT made me delusional,” which has garnered over 4 million views in the past two months. As Silicon Valley continues to shove LLM technology down our collective throats, it feels like only a matter of time until even more strains of AI psychosis—both simulated and sincere—begin to emerge. </span></p>

            <title><![CDATA[Steam Game Devs Call Exploit Allegations ‘Clickbait Exaggeration’ And ‘Malicious Defamation’]]></title>
            <link>https://kotaku.com/screeps-world-steam-game-exploit-pc-hack-2000663214</link>
            <guid>1416898</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><span>The developers behind a popular “open source MMO RTS sandbox game for programming enthusiasts” on Steam, named </span><i><span>Screeps: World,</span></i><span> have been forced to update their game “in order to protect both players” and their “own reputation,” following the discovery of an alleged “remote code execution vulnerability” that would enable players to take control of other players’ computers. Even worse, the person who helped discover the vulnerability in question alleges that Valve “ignored” their reported findings.</span></p> <p><span>If you’re noticing an overabundance of quotes in the previous paragraph, there’s a good reason for that, as this story spawned out of a rather nasty back-and-forth </span><a href="https://x.com/IsaacKing314/status/2015195819251736630?s=20"><span>on X</span></a><span> between </span><i><span>Screeps: World’s</span></i><span> developers Screeps, LLC and an “information security” aficionado by the name of Isaac King.</span></p>

 <p><span>As King explained in his initial post, </span><i><span>Screeps: World</span></i><span> apparently allowed “any other player in the game world to gain remote access to your computer” through the use of a programming exploit. For context, </span><i><span>Screeps: World</span></i><span> is a programming game that lets players write their own code in JavaScript, which is then used to craft their own custom-made AI units.</span></p> <figure id="attachment_2000663224" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000663224"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000663224">©Screeps, LLC</figcaption></figure> <p><span>As of this writing, the game is currently sitting at a “Very Positive” review score on Steam, having amassed roughly 1,876 reviews and, according to </span><a href="https://app.sensortower.com/vgi/game/screeps-world"><span>VG Insights</span></a><span>, over 113,000 individual purchases.</span></p>

 <p><span>If you want the exact explanation of the reputed vulnerability, I highly suggest reading King’s highly detailed write-up of the exploit </span><a href="https://outsidetheasylum.blog/screeps/"><span>on his blog</span></a><span>. I will, however, warn you in advance that it requires (at least) a base understanding of JavaScript to fully understand.</span></p>

 <p><span>Thankfully, King includes an analogy for “non-programmers” in the conclusion: “imagine if there were one particular kind of unit in </span><i><span>Starcraft</span></i><span> that, if you trained it, let people hack your computer. And when pointed out, the game designers said ‘well this is self-inflicted, the players all chose to train that unit’.”</span></p> <p><span>King also explains that the developers have been aware of the issue since July 2024, as one of Screeps, LLC’s two developers replied to a report </span><a href="https://github.com/screeps/screeps/issues/162#issuecomment-2223049479"><span>on GitHub</span></a><span> detailing the vulnerability. The dev in question replied, stating that they “do not see this as a serious security threat.” However, a user from the Screeps Discord </span><a href="https://outsidetheasylum.blog/screeps/usage.png"><span>noted</span></a><span> that the vulnerability had been successfully abused in the past.</span></p>

 <p><span>Once the initial post on X began to gain traction, the official Screeps X account replied stating that the accusation was “at the very least, a clickbait exaggeration, and at worst, malicious defamation intended to cause reputational damage.” Nevertheless, they also stated that the alleged vulnerability has, as of January 25, been removed from </span><i><span>Screeps: World</span></i><span>.</span></p> <p><span>The potentially more worrying side of this is that King noted in his blog post that he’d reported the issue to Steam directly, but didn’t receive a reply: “I reported the game to Steam, which of course they ignored. Their terms of service make them not liable for any hacks caused by malware on the platform, so if it’s getting sales from which they can take a cut, why do anything about it?”</span></p> <p><span>We’ve reached out to Valve to corroborate this, and will update the piece if they reply.</span></p>

            <guid>1416859</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Once-ubiquitous online game streamer Herschel “Dr Disrespect” Beahm, who was banned from Twitch after <a href="https://kotaku.com/dr-disrespect-twitch-ban-sexting-minor-response-1851559888">sending “inappropriate” messages to a minor in 2017</a>, posted a photo of a media badge on January 26 and said he had been invited to a pre-release hands-on event for the newly released, free-to-play raid shooter <em>Highguard</em>. However, multiple people who attended the event denied seeing him there, and some Reddit users believe his photo was faked with gen AI or Photoshop. And <em>Highguard’s</em> creator manager says he wasn’t invited and didn’t attend.</p> <p>On Monday, ahead of the launch of <em>Highguard</em>, DrDisrespect posted an image of a keyboard, a can of energy drink, a personalized controller, and a <em>Highguard</em> media badge with his name on it to his X account. He claimed to have played <em>Highguard</em> at a recent media event in Los Angeles. “Last week we took the Lambo to LA to check out #Highguard,” he wrote. “Monday, January 26th at 10am PST, we enter another dimension! Yayayaya.”</p>

 <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">Last week we took the Lambo to LA to check out <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/Highguard?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#Highguard</a>.</p> <p>Monday, January 26th at 10am PST, we enter another dimension!</p> <p>Yayayaya <a href="https://t.co/kQ56GEfonB">pic.twitter.com/kQ56GEfonB</a></p> <p>— Dr Disrespect (@DrDisrespect) <a href="https://twitter.com/DrDisrespect/status/2015156898040049967?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 24, 2026</a></p></blockquote>  <p>Immediately, people online began sharing the post and claiming the PR team behind <em>Highguard</em> had made a huge mistake inviting someone like DrDisrespect to the event. The streamer was suddenly banned from <a href="https://kotaku.com/dr-disrespect-sexting-twitch-ban-youtube-elden-ring-1851556854">Twitch in June 2020</a> and then later lost sponsorships and other business deals after confirming he’d once sent messages that were “inappropriate” but not “illegal” to someone else on the platform who was under the age of 18. He now streams exclusively on Rumble and YouTube, which allowed his channel to be monetized again after <a href="https://kotaku.com/drdisrespect-twitch-ban-minor-youtube-monetization-1851752083">a multi-month review of the allegations</a>.</p> <p>“Choosing to work with a self-admitted pedophile to market your game is certainly…A choice,” <a href="https://x.com/EpicNNG/status/2015836937865634276">posted a game dev and writer.</a>&nbsp; “Never heard of <em>Highguard</em>. Is it good marketing to have the first news about your game that some people hear be that you invited a pedophile to your preview event?”<a href="https://bsky.app/profile/alyssamerc.bsky.social/post/3mddtienlps2x/quotes"> posted someone else on BlueSky.</a></p>

 <p>But, not long after the post started going viral online, creators came out to deny that DrDisrespect was ever at the event, claiming he was lying about being invited.</p>   <p>“Dr. Disrespect was not invited to the early access event,” <a href="https://x.com/TheMacroShow/status/2015875906271904060?s=20">posted creator Macro on Twitter</a>. “I know this because I WAS THERE, and I promise you, everyone would’ve noticed that pedo a mile away. There’s so many valid things you can criticize <em>Highguard</em> for, but this isn’t one of them.” Kate Sánchez, the EIC of<em> ButWhyTho</em>, <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/ohmymithrandir.bsky.social/post/3mddwfcpcf22h">also denied he was there, adding</a>: “I literally did not see him there – unless creators had a different day.” Another content creator, <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/blessingjr.bsky.social/post/3mddxvxapqs2q"><em>Kinda Funny</em>‘s Blessing Adeoye Jr</a>., also believed DrDisrespect was not at the LA event, but said there was a second day for creators only. Sánchez and Adeoye Jr. didn’t attend the creator day.</p>

 <p><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/chinpua?originalSubdomain=ca"><em>Highguard</em> creator manager Chin Pua</a> replied to a viral tweet about DrDisrespect and <a href="https://x.com/thingscp/status/2015884206329463060">confirmed that he</a> “was not invited to any <em>Highguard</em> event past or present, and the badge was not an official badge.”&nbsp;<em>Kotaku</em> has reached out to <em>Highguard</em> PR but has yet to hear back.&nbsp; A freelancer <em>Kotaku</em> sent to the event didn’t see DrDisrespect at the press day either.</p> <p>Over on the <em>Highguard</em> subreddit, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/HighGuardgame/comments/1qnd1vl/is_dr_disrespects_badge_fake/">some players are theorizing that DrDisrespect faked the image</a> using AI tools or Photoshop. The evidence involves how the media badge looks compared to other real, confirmed badges from the event. It does seem like, if he were there, he was given a somewhat unusual badge with a different layout than other attendees. If DrDisrespect didn’t attend, he has yet to publicly confirm that on social media or elsewhere. He also streamed the game on <a href="https://x.com/DrDisrespect/status/2015815750825730082">Rumble and YouTube</a> on launch day.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><span>Earlier this month, Wildlight Entertainment invited a whole host of media and content creators to take a hands-on look at <em>Highguard</em>–a 3v3 “raid shooter” whose big reveal was the closer to last month’s Game Awards. Reaction to that trailer was </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/game-awards-trailers-recap-highguard-titanfall-apex-2000653088"><span>decidedly mixed</span></a><span>. This article isn’t about my thoughts on the game itself, which <a href="https://kotaku.com/highguard-impressions-titanfall-2-apex-multiplayer-shooter-2000663136">you can find here</a>, but rather what it felt like to attend an event for a game which was already being treated by some online as </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/concord-sony-biggest-flop-failure-box-office-1851676475"><span>gaming’s next </span><i><span>Concord</span></i></a><span>. What’s it like to be one of the first people outside of the studio to play something that so many had already written off despite not really knowing what it was even trying to be?&nbsp;</span></p> <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/highguard-game-awards-trailer-rust-hero-shooter-interview-2000663137"><span>The </span><i><span>Highguard</span></i></a><span> Launch Event, as my lanyard calls it, was an all-day affair held in Los Angeles that was scheduled to run from 9 a.m. to 6 p.m. Making the trek from Long Beach, I boarded my Lyft (paid for by Wildlight) at about 7:45 in the morning, and despite my best efforts at being punctual, didn’t arrive at the venue until about 9:15. Being stuck in a sea of cars on the I-110 gave me a lot of time to think about what the day ahead had in store.</span></p>

 <p><span>While players experiencing the game for the first time today will have an entirely different experience, myself and the other folks who experienced the game that day only had the TGAs trailer to base our expectations on, and it hardly told us anything about the game at all. None of us knew what a “PvP raid shooter” was, nor did we know anything about the moment-to-moment gameplay beyond a short description on the Steam store page: “From the creators of</span><i><span> Apex Legends</span></i><span> and </span><i><span>Titanfall</span></i><span>&nbsp;comes </span><i><span>Highguard</span></i><span>: a PvP raid shooter where players will ride, fight, and raid as Wardens, arcane gunslingers sent to fight for control of a mythical continent.”&nbsp;</span></p> <h2>9:16 AM – January 21 – NYA West, A Hazy Recollection, And Coffee #2 (and #3)</h2> <p><span>The first thing I noticed upon arriving was a faint feeling of deja vu. I’d been to this venue before, I thought. It took me a few moments to realize that I’d been in this same part of town for EA’s own preview event for </span><i><span>Star Wars Jedi: Survivor</span></i><span> back in 2023; I wondered if the members of Wildlight in charge of picking the place had still been at Respawn back then. After checking in at reception, I walked into a lobby filled with fellow members of the press from all over the world. I grabbed my second coffee of the day, some yogurt, and an apple Danish from an assortment laid out in front of me; besides the coffee I’d grabbed earlier that morning I hadn’t yet had any breakfast, and the longer-than-expected commute had me starving.</span></p>

 <figure id="attachment_2000663168" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000663168"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000663168">Kotaku / James Galizio</figcaption></figure> <p><span>Conversing with other members of the press, I confirmed what I’d already assumed; none of us quite knew what we were about to play. Despite this, there was a quiet hope that perhaps the trailer was a misstep, and that the game itself might impress. I spoke with </span><i><span>GameSpot</span></i><span>‘s Jordan Ramée and another L.A. native freelancer friend of mine, Luis Joshua Gutierrez, among a few others, as I scarfed down my food and coffee.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><span>Out of the corner of my eye I noticed Geoff Keighley. The Game Awards host was the only person outside of the development team who might be able to answer our questions as to what exactly </span><i><span>Highguard</span></i><span> is, as he’d played it the previous summer before asking the team to let him put it in his December showcase. Had he selected a surprise hit, or attached his brand to another live-service dud?. I downed Coffee #3.</span></p> <h2>9:52 AM – So, What On Earth Is A “PvP Raid Shooter,” Anyway?</h2> <p><span>The event running slightly ahead of schedule, we were shepherded into an auditorium. Once everyone had been seated, we got the whole spiel–who Wildlight are, how <em>Highguard</em> came to be, and what being a “raid shooter” actually entails. Roughly 4 years ago, when Wildlight was only about 5 members big, the team spent some time playing shooters all day in search of inspiration. As the team put it, “we were trying to figure out what the question was that we wanted our game to answer.” Inspiration itself came from the experience of riding to and raiding bases in </span><i><span>Rust</span></i><span>; the team wanted to figure out a way to distill those experiences into something repeatable, without all the busy prep work that survival crafting games require.</span></p>

 <p><span>Of course, everyone wanted to know why the team had opted for radio silence since the game’s reveal; the answer to that was twofold. We were given one half of the answer there and then, with the other coming just a bit later in the day. Originally the team had intended to shadowdrop the game, much as they had done with </span><i><span>Apex Legends</span></i><span> when they had still worked at Respawn. As it so happened, the Game Awards trailer only came to fruition at the eleventh hour after Geoff Keighley had offered up the spot upon being impressed by the game during his personal demo earlier in the year.&nbsp;</span></p> <figure id="attachment_2000663167" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000663167"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000663167">Kotaku / James Galizio</figcaption></figure> <p><span>In hindsight, given how complicated the game’s systems are to explain and the TGAs’ strict runtime, it’s little surprise the trailer struggled to land. The radio silence, then, was equal parts a return to the original plan as well as an acknowledgement that the game would perhaps best speak for itself. Still, rather than being tossed in entirely blind and letting the game make its own impression, press and influencers had to watch a thorough overview of the shooter’s mechanics and systems before getting our hands on the controllers and keyboards laid out for us.</span></p> <p><span>Entering the auditorium, I saw the venue was split in two halves. On the right were groups of PCs, 6 a piece, paired with some very expensive Dell 4K OLED monitors. While by default players could play with mechanical keyboard and gaming mouse, Wildlight quickly noted that anyone who wished to play with a controller could request either a PlayStation 5 Dualsense or an Xbox Wireless Controller, and they would bring one right over. On the opposite wall was a collection of 3D models of in-game assets, heaps of concept art showcasing the game’s world and its characters, and more.</span></p>

 <h2>11:30 AM – Probing the Vibes</h2> <p><span>With lunch scheduled for noon, I only had time for a handful of matches. </span><i><span>IGN</span></i><span>‘s Travis Northup had his first interview with the team scheduled early, leaving myself and the other member of our impromptu group–</span><i><span>GameSpot</span></i><span>‘s Jordan Ramée–to wander over to the art that caught our eye. I wondered how the artists that had drawn these felt about the reception to the game’s reveal.</span></p> <p><span>It occurred to me at this point that the event took up a great deal of space, especially when considering the modest number of press in attendance. There were a couple dozen of us, by no means a small amount, yet the venue was so large that it bordered on feeling empty. I wondered if the team had expected or planned for a larger audience when they’d booked the location; there was certainly room for double, maybe even triple the number of attendees. Maybe the crowd during the influencer session, held a day earlier, had been a lot bigger. I grabbed Coffee #4 from a concessions table while waiting for the lunch spread to be set up.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <figure id="attachment_2000663169" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000663169"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000663169">Kotaku / James Galizio</figcaption></figure> <p><span>After gorging myself on sandwiches, wraps, an energy bar and at least one more cup of coffee I played a few more rounds of the game before heading off to a set of interviews with some of the game’s core designers, as well as the studio’s cofounders. As the day progressed, it was fascinating watching folks slowly come to grips with some of the intricacies of the gameplay loop. You can read my <a href="https://kotaku.com/highguard-impressions-titanfall-2-apex-multiplayer-shooter-2000663136">hands-on impressions here,</a> or decide for yourself now that the full game is live.&nbsp;</span></p> <h2>5:12 PM – Winding Down, and Cacio e Pepe Pizza</h2> <p><span>The event was set to go until 6PM, but with the memories of my agonizingly long ride to the event I had no intentions of grabbing my Lyft home right in the middle of L.A.’s notorious rush hour traffic. There were no plans for an afterparty, though we had been given per diem cards to help pay for food and other amenities and a few of us had the same idea<!--StartFragment --><span>—</span><!--EndFragment --></span><span>we decided on grabbing some pizza and drinks from a bar close by that came recommended.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>While waiting in line to order my first drink, I witnessed what felt like a microcosm for the day’s events as a whole when the bartender tripped up and spilled a drink order for one party. She quickly adjusted, repouring their beers and bringing them over successfully with the second attempt, ultimately no worse for wear. I doubt the two gentlemen who’d ordered them even remember the spilled drinks; I get the feeling that Wildlight is banking on something similar. If </span><i><span>Highguard</span></i><span> can ultimately speak for itself, then will it matter in the end that they messed up with the reveal trailer? No one will remember. Well, except maybe Geoff Keighley.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><span>Scanning through the menu, my eye was drawn to an unorthodox-sounding pizza flavor; Cacio e Pepe, like the pasta dish. Evidently I was the only one at the table that was familiar with the flavor, and we ordered the pie to give it a shot. It was delicious, and I’d only wish it hadn’t been devoured so quickly–I would have loved a slice or two for the ride home. Sometimes it’s good to take a chance on something different.</span></p>

              <p>When <a href="https://kotaku.com/game-awards-trailers-recap-highguard-titanfall-apex-2000653088">The Game Awards 2025 ended with a trailer for <em>Highguard</em></a>, a new FPS from some ex-<em>Titanfall</em> devs, it failed to wow the internet, and <a href="https://kotaku.com/highguard-breaks-radio-silence-and-the-internet-reacts-2000662650">the weeks of radio silence that followed</a> only provided a void that was quickly filled by speculation, debate, and skepticism. Now, weeks later, <em>Highguard</em> has finally launched, and everyone has a chance to play it and really figure out what this game is, likely determining if it will be a hit or <a href="https://kotaku.com/concord-shutting-down-closing-servers-refunds-ps5-1851638566">another short-lived multiplayer flop like <em>Concord</em>.</a> Early impressions are that it’s solid, but many are struggling to even play the game due to server queues, disconnects, and performance issues on console and PC.</p> <p><em>Highguard</em> went live on January 26 across consoles and PC to a large amount of confusion, curiosity, and, sure, some actual hype. The devs did a big deep dive on Monday, revealing that the game is a 3v3 PVP “raid shooter.” This translates into what looks like a game that mixes together <em>Rainbow Six Siege’</em>s base defense mechanics, MOBA-like clashes between teams in the field, gear upgrades, and a final big raid on one of the team’s bases to decide who wins the match.</p>

 <p>From what I’ve seen so far and played, it could be a lot of fun. <a href="https://kotaku.com/highguard-impressions-titanfall-2-apex-multiplayer-shooter-2000663136">Our preview of the new FPS is similarly positive about <em>Highguard</em></a>. But the game isn’t running well on my RTX 5070 PC, even at medium settings with DLSS. And I’m not alone in dealing with performance issues and other problems.</p>  <h2><em>Highguard’s </em>PC problems and no FOV slider on PS5</h2> <p>On the game’s subreddit, more than a few players are complaining about <em>Highguard</em> running poorly on their rigs, even those with solid specs. Other players are having issues with the game’s settings not changing despite multiple attempts to do so. Some are also running into a bug where dialogue is missing during the tutorial. On console, <em>Highguard</em> lacks an FOV slider, an issue that led to a lot of angry fans when<em> Borderlands 4</em> was missing the same popular feature on PS5 and Xbox. <a href="https://kotaku.com/borderlands-4-fov-slider-consoles-ps5-update-pc-crashing-patch-performance-2000628823"><em>Borderlands 4</em> eventually added it</a>. I’ll be curious to see if <em>Highguard</em> does, too. Players are also complaining about the game looking blurry on consoles, which might be a quicker fix.</p>

 <p>Another issue that will likely be smoothed out over the next 24 hours is players getting stuck in server queues or getting disconnected while playing. Considering the fact that nearly 98k players all tried to play <em>Highguard</em> on Steam alone, <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/4128260/charts/">according to SteamDB data,</a> I’d bet that the servers are just struggling to keep up with the demand. It’s annoying for gamers, but I can imagine the devs are thankful that so many people want to play <em>Highguard</em> that the servers are struggling to get them all in.</p>

 <p><em>Concord</em> didn’t have such high playercount numbers on Steam. In fact, <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/2443720/charts/">it failed to crack 1,000 concurrent players</a>. <em>Highguard</em> has been compared many times by online commentators to that live-service flop, which shut down less than a month after its dismal launch. It seems all but certain that <em>Highguard</em> will stick around a bit longer than that. Hopefully some of the technical issues and bugs can be ironed out. The devs have confirmed they have around a year of content in development for <em>Highguard</em>, which will get regular updates like most live-service games.</p> <p>Now that it’s finally out, all the speculation can be replaced with what tends to come next when live-service games launch: People claiming it’s a dead game.</p>
