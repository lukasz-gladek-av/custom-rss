Instead, it follows a different group of Phantom Thieves led by a high school student code-named Wonder. The team attends a different high school and is accompanied by a different mascot character, the tonfa-wielding owl named Lufel. The other major difference between <em>The Phantom X </em>and most <em>Persona </em>games is that it has microtransactions and gacha mechanics. Yes, to take part in the game’s social sim and dungeon crawling, you’ll have to either wait for a set amount of time to pass or use currency to replenish your energy. Otherwise, the game is free-to-play. Check out the announcement trailer below:</p><p><em>Persona 5: The Phantom X </em>will launch on PC and mobile devices on June 26. When Atlus first teased the announcement, some people thought it was referencing <em>Persona 6</em>. However, the RPGs typically shed their previous color scheme and aesthetics with each mainline entry, so most fans knew the black-and-red graphic indicated that whatever this game was, it was still part of the <em>Persona 5 </em>subseries. This, coupled with the owl emoji used on the social posts, clearly hinted at a <em>Phantom X</em> announcement, but the game<em> </em>has been sequestered in China for so long that some fans aren’t even aware of it. <em>The Phantom X </em>was <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/persona-5-new-announced-phantom-of-night-p5-p5x-mobile-1850235928&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/persona-5-new-announced-phantom-of-night-p5-p5x-mobile-1850235928">originally announced in 2023</a></span> and has been in an open beta phase in the territory since last year.</p><p>With <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/persona-6-logo-green-leak-midori-atlus-sega-1851499836&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/persona-6-logo-green-leak-midori-atlus-sega-1851499836"><em>Persona 6 </em>rumors floating around</a></span>, it’s entirely possible that <em>The Phantom X </em>could be the final game in the <em>Persona 5 </em>subseries.

That’s because Nintendo isn’t sending out early units to press and content creators, according to a new report by<em> The Game Business</em>. It’s a highly unusual headscratcher that has some third-party publishers flummoxed. <br></p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="196230" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="This Cool New Retro Console Is A Great Gift For Atari Fans" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="217" data-playlist="196230,195410,196143" data-current="196230"><div><p>This Cool New Retro Console Is A Great Gift For Atari Fans</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196230/196230_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196230/196230_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196230/196230_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196230/196230_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/21779.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>“The games press will not be receiving Nintendo Switch 2 consoles until just before it comes out,” <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.thegamebusiness.com/p/major-media-outlets-will-not-have&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.thegamebusiness.com/p/major-media-outlets-will-not-have" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">writes <em> The Game Business</em>’ Chris Dring</a></span> (it’s a great newsletter <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.thegamebusiness.com/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.thegamebusiness.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">you should subscribe to</a></span>). He reports that some in the media won’t get their review units until launch day on June 5, with Nintendo blaming the delay on the need for a major day-one patch. The Switch 2 launches right before Summer Game Fest, a busy period for big game announcements and new trailers that could delay in-depth coverage of the new console even further. </p><p>It’s a major departure from how Nintendo handled the rollout of the original Switch back in 2017, when the company was still licking its wounds from the disastrous Wii U console generation. With the long-awaited <em>The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild</em> <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/nintendo-switch-2-launch-zelda-botw-anniversary-1851767489&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/nintendo-switch-2-launch-zelda-botw-anniversary-1851767489">being available at launch</a></span>, the <em>Mario </em>maker made sure outlets had access to the Switch <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/nintendo-switch-the-kotaku-review-1792776350&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/nintendo-switch-the-kotaku-review-1792776350">more than a week in advance</a></span> in order to both test the new hardware and complete the sprawling open-world RPG. </p><p>Delaying hands-on access to the Switch 2 until the same time as the general public suggests the hardware is either coming in hot—a possibility bolstered by the apparent urgency of a day-one software patch—or Nintendo simply doesn’t care about building pre-release hype with early Switch 2 reviews and all of the hands-on videos and social media buzz that flows from them. </p><p>The console is already expected to sell over 15 million units in its first year, with shortages seemingly likely at launch and into the summer. Everyone knows what the Switch can do, and for the most part the Switch 2 is just a bigger, better version of that existing product. Most fans have probably already made up their minds one way or the other. </p><p>Delaying Switch 2 reviews seems of a piece with Nintendo’s evolving direct-to-consumer approach, beginning years ago with Nintendo Directs and culminating recently in a dedicated standalone news app for the new hardware. Though it also seems of a piece with a lot of <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/zelda-botw-switch-2-price-dlc-expansion-pass-cyberpunk-1851775786&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/zelda-botw-switch-2-price-dlc-expansion-pass-cyberpunk-1851775786">ambient weirdness around the release of the Switch 2</a></span> that’s detracted from <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/nintendo-switch-2-hands-on-previews-mouse-mario-kart-1851774555&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/nintendo-switch-2-hands-on-previews-mouse-mario-kart-1851774555">otherwise positive assessments</a></span> of the hardware at preview events. </p><p>But that doesn’t mean the review delays are good for everyone else. Insight into any major shortcomings or bugs that need to be ironed out ahead of launch could be the difference between someone paying hundreds of dollars over the $450 price tag to a scalper on eBay, or just waiting until more inventory is available closer to the 2025 holiday season. </p><p>One PR rep at a <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/switch-2-upgrade-pack-hogwarts-legacy-civ-7-1851780505&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/switch-2-upgrade-pack-hogwarts-legacy-civ-7-1851780505">third-party developer with a launch game</a></span> for the Switch 2 told <em>The Game Business </em>that the “lack of independent critical validation” now makes them wonder if they should have waited to release their game until a few weeks after the dust had settled around the new hardware. We’ll know how it all shakes out in just a few weeks when Nintendo’s next console generation kicks off in June. <br></p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

The journey began six days ago, in Boston, and is currently in Augusta, Maine, venturing toward Stephen King country on what appears to be a collective desire to reach Canada. Directions are chosen by votes that take place every few seconds—whichever available direction receives the majority of the votes, that’s the way the Street View moves, made all the more adorable by the inclusion of a steering wheel at the bottom of the screen.</p><p>Since I’ve been watching/voting for a couple of hours (since my chum Paul tipped me off to the game—thanks Paul!), a whopping five miles of progress has been made. This is partly because the entire endeavor is inherently slow, but also because of awful people (tee hee) who keep voting to take completely pointless detours. Should enough malevolent people (snicker) vote to take a right down some dirt track that loops back onto the main road, that’s what’ll happen, to the dismay of all the sensible people in the site’s chat.</p><figure id="" data-id="880cca8e56a1f3943bbf1ed003a72238" data-recommend-id="image://880cca8e56a1f3943bbf1ed003a72238" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A Google Street View image of a car driving through Augusta, Maine." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A Google Street View image of a car driving through Augusta, Maine." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Neal Agarwal / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="880cca8e56a1f3943bbf1ed003a72238" data-recommend-id="image://880cca8e56a1f3943bbf1ed003a72238" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A Google Street View image of a car driving through Augusta, Maine." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>The chat is a more recent addition, and according to leading expert Paul, it’s made the whole thing a lot less soothing. It has, however, allowed for those who maliciously choose silly directions (giggle) to see the enraged reactions of the folk actually trying to get somewhere. Of course, given that it’s made up of contributions from 1,100 strangers via Discord, be warned there’s also a lot of garbage in there. (It is apparently <em>hilarious</em> to respond “gay” when anyone encourages voters to pick “straight” on.)</p><p>Consensus appears to be a desire to reach Canada, with the more confident denizens of the chat window already debating whether to head to Montreal specifically. By my estimation that dream is weeks away, if not longer given how many nefarious types seem to vote for loop-de-loop routes (guffaw). Much better to just focus on Bangor for now. Oh, and if you can rally enough people, you can vote to change the radio station, the “DJ” of which I’m pretty sure has been voiced by creator Neal Agarwal himself. Or you can even vote to honk the horn (something that won favor when the Street View had the car in the wrong lane of traffic, with cars coming straight toward us).</p><figure id="" data-id="6f3e5f261d015dcdaa335c9cc22fc021" data-recommend-id="image://6f3e5f261d015dcdaa335c9cc22fc021" data-format="jpg" data-width="1520" data-height="855" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A Google Street View image of a car driving toward a spooky house in Augusta, Maine." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A Google Street View image of a car driving toward a spooky house in Augusta, Maine." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Neal Agarwal / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="6f3e5f261d015dcdaa335c9cc22fc021" data-recommend-id="image://6f3e5f261d015dcdaa335c9cc22fc021" data-format="jpg" data-width="1520" data-height="855" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A Google Street View image of a car driving toward a spooky house in Augusta, Maine." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Agarwal has an extraordinary gift for data manipulation.
