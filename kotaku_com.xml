The devs confirmed the sci-fi shooter “will fully utilize DualSense controller features, including haptic feedback and adaptive triggers for deeper player immersion,” on Sony’s platform. A PS5 Pro update is also in the works, though it’s unclear if that will be ready in time for the PS5 launch. </p><p>  <em>Stalker 2</em> earned fresh fans and won over older ones with its dedication to plunking players down in a mysterious and hostile environment where every bullet and health pack is precious and the mere act of seeing what’s down a road requires a minor act of in-game courage. It does not pander or hand-hold, and with more time spent and less jank (and an earlier release date) it might have entered more GOTY-contender conversations. </p><p>Unfortunately, the bugs at launch on PC and Xbox Series X/S were hard to completely ignore, even if they were entirely par for the course with a complex sandbox game and in keeping with <em>Stalke</em>r’s messy history. While there have been a healthy number of updates and patches in the months since its release, some players have lost patience, and<em> Stalker 2</em>'s ratings on both Steam and Xbox have only gotten spottier. “I’ve been defending <em>Stalker 2</em> since release, but I feel like I am starting to give up a bit,”<span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/stalker/comments/1l95ryh/ive_been_defending_stalker_2_since_release_but_i/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/stalker/comments/1l95ryh/ive_been_defending_stalker_2_since_release_but_i/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"> wrote one fan</a></span> on the subreddit last month in a thread explaining their frustrations.</p><p>I imagine porting the game to another set of hardware will only complicate things further. Otherwise, the PS5 debut is the perfect opportunity for GSC Game World to show everyone what they’ve been missing. <br></p><p>.</p></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://kotaku.com/stalker-2-ps5-pro-patch-bugs-xbox-release-date-1851785879]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Live-service game development has become the ultimate gamble for any publisher. If you get a hit, you’re set—money will pour in for as long as you can surf the wave. If you miss, countless millions are lost forever. Most of them miss. The latest game to spectacularly fail to be a long-running cash cow is <em>Steel Hunters</em>, the extraction shooter released into Early Access just three months ago by <em>World of Tanks</em> creators Wargaming. It’ll be gone for good by October.</p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="195618" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="Unboxing The Baldur’s Gate 3 Collector’s Edition" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="376" data-playlist="195618,196358,196626" data-current="195618"><div><p>Unboxing The Baldur’s Gate 3 Collector’s Edition</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195618/195618_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195618/195618_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195618/195618_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195618/195618_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/21110.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>Properly revealed <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/game-awards-2024-trailers-announcements-world-premieres-1851720032/slides/23&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/game-awards-2024-trailers-announcements-world-premieres-1851720032/slides/23">during last December’s Game Awards</a></span>, <em>Steel Hunters</em> looked like it was going to be a spectacular mech combat game, with heavy <em>Transformers</em> vibes. Sure, it’s a terrible title, but it matches the utilitarian naming conventions of Wargaming, renowned for <em>World of Tanks </em>and <em>World of Warplanes</em>. The early footage looked incredible, and everyone loves a stompy robot online shooter, so given Wargaming’s history of enormous success it seemed like a reasonably safe bet.</p><p>But nope. Since <em>Steel Hunters</em> launched into Early Access April 2, it peaked at fewer than 4,500 players, and hasn’t managed over 1,000 concurrent players since April 18. And let’s stress: this is a free-to-play game, that hadn’t even added in-app purchases. At the time of writing, this free, live-service PvPvE shooter has 34 players online. Its peak so far in July is 138. It is a <em>colossal</em> flop.</p><p>Of the nearly 4,000 reviews on Steam, just 58 percent are positive, meaning <em>Steel Hunters</em> sits very firmly in the doomed Mixed territory. And while judgement is usually reserved when it comes to Early Access games, players had less reason to hope for significant change given the Steam page statement that the current build “represents a polished foundation of <em>Steel Hunters. </em>It includes the core gameplay mechanics, maps, Hunters, and progression system that provide a strong starting point for players.”</p><p>However, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1691340?emclan=103582791474864271&amp;emgid=527598784391155504&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1691340?emclan=103582791474864271&amp;emgid=527598784391155504" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">an update added to Steam</a></span> July 8 explained that the game is not going to last. Titled “Sunsetting,” it begins, “Today we share difficult news.”</p><p>Addressing presumably the couple of hundred people still playing, Wargaming explains, “we’ve made the decision to sunset <em>Steel Hunters</em>. You’ve given us so much passion and support but unfortunately we’ve come to the conclusion that continuing development is not sustainable. We know this isn’t the news anyone wanted to hear and we genuinely share in your disappointment.”</p><p>It’s not being immediately switched off, however. Servers will remain online for another 90 days, and there are even plans to roll out custom game support, as well as unlocking all the game’s Hunters for people to play as—including some that were obviously intended to be added later.</p><p>If it had been hoped that the announcement might cause a rush return of players to make the most of the closing months, that’s been dashed. There were fewer players Tuesday than Monday. </p><p>The game itself is said to be fine. That’s perhaps the most damning element here. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.pcgamer.com/games/third-person-shooter/steel-hunters-is-like-a-more-tactical-titanfall-but-as-an-extraction-shooter-its-undermined-by-boring-loot/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/third-person-shooter/steel-hunters-is-like-a-more-tactical-titanfall-but-as-an-extraction-shooter-its-undermined-by-boring-loot/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>PC Gamer</em> described it as</a></span> “a more tactical <em>Titanfall</em>,” let down by poor loot and feeling too early, and <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://gamingbolt.com/steel-hunters-early-access-review-middle-of-the-food-chain&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://gamingbolt.com/steel-hunters-early-access-review-middle-of-the-food-chain" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>Gaming Bolt</em> said</a></span> a confusion of genres and muddled progression were the downsides of a fun, destructive game. But there’s just no room left in the fiercely competitive world of live-service games to be average. You have to be a massive, all-consuming success, or you’re doomed to “sunset” after a handful of months.</p><p><em>Steel Hunters</em> was created by Wargaming’s UK studio, DPS Games. We reached out to find out if this might lead to any job losses at Wargaming, which has an astonishing 15 studios around the world, and received the following statement:</p><blockquote data-type="BlockQuote"><p>Wargaming has made the difficult decision to sunset Steel Hunters project. We are committed to supporting our talented team and will work to find suitable roles for as many employees as possible within the company. We sincerely thank the Steel Hunters community for their passion and support throughout the project.</p></blockquote><p>.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://kotaku.com/steel-hunters-wargaming-world-of-tanks-live-service-1851785861]]></content:encoded>
