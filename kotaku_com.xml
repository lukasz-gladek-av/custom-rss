This 2024 colorful 2.5D  platformer is easily of one of the best “metroidvania” games released in years, and it’s definitely one of Ubisoft’s best games in recent memory. It plays wonderfully, looks amazing, runs like a dream, and has some memorable boss fights.  It’s also not massive. Most people can finish it in under 18 hours. Seriously, check this one out later this month on either PS4 or PS5. </p><p>Meanwhile, if you want to see where the<em> Armored Core</em> franchise started, the first three PS1-era games will be added to PS Plus Premium later this month. I have fond memories of fighting my brother in <em>Armored Core</em>’s demo, but never actually played the full game. Perhaps I’ll give them a shot later this March. </p><p>Remember, to access, download, and play these games you’ll need to be an active PS Plus Extra or Premium tier subscriber.

They want to be able to make your replica continue to work, as you, during a future strike, whether you like it or not. And once you’ve given your specific consent for how your replica can be used, they refuse to tell you what they actually did with it.”</p><p>The internal communication said that while progress had been made on some issues, the guild was not close to a deal on AI protections. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.sagaftra.org/sites/default/files/2025-03/IMA%20Comparison%20Chart.pdf&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.sagaftra.org/sites/default/files/2025-03/IMA%20Comparison%20Chart.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">It linked to an extensive breakdown</a></span> of current contract language proposals from both sides in which SAG-AFTRA accused game companies of wanting to retain overly broad loopholes that would effectively render the whole AI protection provision moot. One particular sticking point is a carveout that would let companies create digital replicas using any existing in-game performances from prior to the next contract, as well as any publicly available data like voice actors doing interviews on YouTube. </p><p>“Digital Replica and Generative AI protections only apply to services provided after this Agreement is signed,” reads the guild’s chart. “Previous game work (including Sideletter 6 games) and un-covered work (anything available in public; YouTube, websites, etc.) are carved out with no transparency, consent or compensation. This makes the entire AI protection provision useless.”</p><p>SAG-AFTRA also accuses game companies of trying to get its members to turn on one another and of trying to “exploit” actors who don’t typically perform in games to fill roles during the ongoing strike. “I was replaced as Soldier 11 because I am unwilling to perform work not covered by a SAG Interim Agreement during a strike for AI protection, the outcome of which will determine the future of our industry,” <em>Zenless Zone Zero</em>’s Soldier 11 voice actor, Emeri Chase, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://bsky.app/profile/emerichase.com/post/3lk5orkz76s2y&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://bsky.app/profile/emerichase.com/post/3lk5orkz76s2y" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">wrote on social media today</a></span>.</p><p>Other game performers have also been replaced as the strike has continued, including actors for <em>Call of Duty: Black Ops 6</em>. “My only concern is for my brand as a performer. Fans of the game have reached out to me because the lack of crediting [of the replacement actor] implies that it may still be me which unfairly represents my abilities as a performer,” Zeke Alton, who plays William Peck, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.gamedeveloper.com/audio/black-ops-6-zombies-characters-recast-after-original-actors-withdrew-during-strike&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/audio/black-ops-6-zombies-characters-recast-after-original-actors-withdrew-during-strike" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">told <em>Game Developer</em> last year</a></span>. </p><p> “We have proposed a deal that includes wage increases of over 15% for SAG-AFTRA represented performers in video games, as well as enhanced health and safety protections, industry-leading terms of use for AI digital replicas in-game and additional compensation for the use of an actor’s performance in other games,” a spokesperson for the game company bargaining group, Audrey Cooling, said in a statement. “We have made meaningful progress and are eager to return to the bargaining table to reach a deal.” </p><p>Meanwhile, story scenes in <em>Destiny 2</em> <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.bungie.net/7/en/News/Article/twid-01-30-25&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.bungie.net/7/en/News/Article/twid-01-30-25" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">have gone unvoiced in the new Heresy saga</a></span> and other roles risk being <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.gamedeveloper.com/audio/supergiant-denies-recasting-hades-ii-actor-over-interim-sag-aftra-contract-request?utm_source=dlvr.it&amp;utm_medium=bluesky&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/audio/supergiant-denies-recasting-hades-ii-actor-over-interim-sag-aftra-contract-request?utm_source=dlvr.it&amp;utm_medium=bluesky" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">recast at studios</a></span> that don’t sign onto interim agreements with AI protections.

You need to understand both of its modes <em>and</em> the unique mechanics to use it properly. That’s asking for a lot when compared with other weapons in the game, but we promise the damage it delivers makes this worth the extra effort.</p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="1e4480c0ed9bfc28f1dabbf914352360" data-recommend-id="image://1e4480c0ed9bfc28f1dabbf914352360" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="A woman holds a ludicrously large axe in the middle of a swampy forest." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A woman holds a ludicrously large axe in the middle of a swampy forest." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Capcom / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="1e4480c0ed9bfc28f1dabbf914352360" data-recommend-id="image://1e4480c0ed9bfc28f1dabbf914352360" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="A woman holds a ludicrously large axe in the middle of a swampy forest." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p><strong>What makes the Charge Blade such a complex weapon is that it’s made up of two weapon configurations: Sword Mode and Axe Mode.</strong> The former equips you with a sword and shield for quick movement and defensive guarding; the latter combines the two into a heavy axe that sacrifices your defense and speed for powerful attacks.</p><p>Knowing when to swap between the two is naturally an important part of learning how to use a Charge Blade. Cycling between the two modes is vital for combat. A unique mechanic for this weapon will have you gather energy with your sword to then use for your axe, or to provide buffs to your equipment.</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="ee69e4500a0135fcea8fc9694a17c285" data-recommend-id="image://ee69e4500a0135fcea8fc9694a17c285" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="The Charge Blade Weapon properties menu, highlighting the Charge Gauge entry." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="The Charge Blade Weapon properties menu, highlighting the Charge Gauge entry." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Capcom / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="ee69e4500a0135fcea8fc9694a17c285" data-recommend-id="image://ee69e4500a0135fcea8fc9694a17c285" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="The Charge Blade Weapon properties menu, highlighting the Charge Gauge entry." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>Aside from offering two weapon modes, the Charge Blade’s defining trait is its Phial mechanic. Underneath the Melee Weapon Sharpness gauge will be four icons to keep an eye on: a Sword, a Shield, an Axe, and a set of five phials. <strong>Landing hits in Sword Mode will gradually accumulate energy.</strong> The outline of the phials will turn yellow and then red to convey how much energy you’ve built up. Keep attacking and the icons will start flashing bright red to signal that you have too much, with your sword attacks bouncing off enemies until you’ve discharged the energy.</p><p>You have a few options for how to charge the phials:</p><ul data-type="List" data-style="Bullet"><li><strong>Basic Charge</strong> – This forms the basis of your gameplay loop. Activate the Charge command by pressing R2 + Circle or RT + B to store the energy in your phials. Do this when the Phials are yellow or red to fill up three of them, or all of them, respectively. The energy will then be consumed through the various Axe: Element Discharge moves, including the important Amped Element Discharge (AED) and Super Amped Element Discharge (SAED). You can enhance these even further by charging the phials twice in a row before going into Axe Mode</li><li><strong>Element Boost</strong> – Hold down Circle or B during the Charge animation to receive Elemental Boost. This is indicated by the Shield icon lighting up, although it’s not purely a defensive buff. Having this active will enhance your guard and make it possible to follow up an AED with an SAED in Axe Mode</li><li><strong>Condensed Elemental Slash</strong> – If you have Element Boost active, you can hold Triangle or Y during the Charge animation to activate Sword Boost Mode. Your sword attacks will deal more damage and will no longer deflect</li></ul><p>The basic gameplay loop is to charge your phials, consume them in Axe Mode, and then return to Sword Mode to charge again. I highly recommend activating the buffs for your shield and sword if you want to make the most out of this weapon. A lot of extra damage will be left on the table by not making use of them.</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="9544862d4b1ed4181595eb8cea5f0f80" data-recommend-id="image://9544862d4b1ed4181595eb8cea5f0f80" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="The Charge Blade Weapon properties menu, highlighting the Power Axe Mode entry." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="The Charge Blade Weapon properties menu, highlighting the Power Axe Mode entry." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Capcom / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="9544862d4b1ed4181595eb8cea5f0f80" data-recommend-id="image://9544862d4b1ed4181595eb8cea5f0f80" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="The Charge Blade Weapon properties menu, highlighting the Power Axe Mode entry." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>There is another buff tangibly related to the Phial mechanic. Power Axe Mode, commonly referred to as Savage Axe by fans, will significantly increase the heavy weapon’s effectiveness.

A cute but dangerous alien crash lands on Earth, pretends to be a dog, and becomes the pet and best friend of Lilo. Of course, as you would expect, shenanigans ensue. </p><p><em>Lilo &amp; Stitch</em> is set to arrive in theaters on May 23. Here’s the first official trailer: </p><p> <em>Lilo &amp; Stitch </em>stars Maia Kealoha as Lilo Pelekai. The original voice of Stitch, Chris Sanders, is back behind the now CG incarnation of the alien. He wrote and directed the OG animated film back in 2002. Sydney Agudong also stars as Lilo’s sister and guardian Nani Pelekai. </p><p>It’s been a long time coming for <em>Lilo &amp; Stitch</em>. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/movies/movie-news/lilo-stitch-live-action-disney-remake-works-1148811/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/movies/movie-news/lilo-stitch-live-action-disney-remake-works-1148811/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The live-action remake was announced all the way back in 2018</a></span>. Since then, the film has gone through a <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lilo_%26_Stitch_(2025_film)#Development&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lilo_%26_Stitch_(2025_film)#Development" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">tumultuous development</a></span>, with different directors and writers hopping on and off the project. At one point, <em>Wicked </em>director Jon M. Chu was attached to this thing! Wild. There was also casting controversy, too, with at least one actor replaced before filming after people spotted them using some slurs online. </p><p>But after all that,<em> Lilo &amp; Stitch </em>is finally coming to theaters, and after watching this first trailer my reaction is: Ehh... okay. Fine, whatever. Meh. </p><p>I understand that my love of the original will make it nearly impossible for me to be impartial about this new remake, but I just don’t think we needed this movie. Stitch seems mostly okay, but the trailer feels really flat and people seemed bored to be involved. The kid seems uninterested in what’s happening, likely because she’s a child and is being asked to act alongside nothing or blue-covered tennis balls. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/popculturechat/comments/1477upr/drew_barrymore_on_how_as_a_child_she_thought_et/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/popculturechat/comments/1477upr/drew_barrymore_on_how_as_a_child_she_thought_et/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Remember those stories of how the kids in <em>ET </em>cried because they thought he had died on set</a></span>? That ain’t happening in an era where every film uses CG to create their alien characters. </p><p>Regardless, I get that Disney wants money and I know that kids aren’t as into 2D animation or even CG animation anymore, and prefer live-action stuff. As a result, we are getting a live action remake of basically every Disney movie ever made, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/snow-white-seven-dwarfs-trailer-cgi-ugly-bad-disney-1851712570&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/snow-white-seven-dwarfs-trailer-cgi-ugly-bad-disney-1851712570">including the horrendous-looking <em>Snow White</em></a></span><em>.</em> And yeah, to be clear: This  movie and Disney’s other live action remakes are all for kids. So while I don’t mind dunking on it or laughing at people posting jokes about the new trailer on Twitter, ultimately, what will determine if <em>Lilo &amp; Stitch</em> is a success is if kids drag enough parents to the theater in May. We’ll find out this Summer. </p><p>&nbsp; .<br></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

If you want, you can shut off crossplay by navigating to the <strong>Game Settings</strong> page via the main menu—not the in-game pause menu—then scrolling down on the first tab until you find <strong>Crossplay</strong>, then turning it to <strong>‘Off</strong>.’ Simple!</p><p>But don’t do that if your goal is following this guide! In fact, your entire squad must have crossplay enabled if you wish to utilize all of the game’s multiplayer mechanics, including Squad functionality.</p><h2 id="h1841725"><a id=""></a>There’s a catch, however!</h2><p><strong>You don’t unlock multiplayer from the start in <em>Monster Hunter Wilds</em></strong>. It requires <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/monster-hunter-wilds-how-long-to-beat-story-campaign-1851769015&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/monster-hunter-wilds-how-long-to-beat-story-campaign-1851769015">a relatively streamlined grind</a></span>. You’ll unlock the ability to join a lobby and invite squad members during <strong>Chapter 1 - Back to Camp</strong>, the game’s second story mission. It doesn’t take long to reach this point; under an hour or so if you’re quick-moving and frantically slapping creatures aside with reckless abandon. Everyone you want to play alongside needs to have done the same.</p><h2 id="h1841726"><a id=""></a><strong>How about cross-save functionality in <em>Monster Hunter Wilds</em>?</strong></h2><p>Okay, cool. You can play flawlessly with hunters from across the world on numerous current-gen systems and PC. But what about cross-save functionality for when <em>you’re</em> the one playing across multiple systems?</p><p>Unfortunately, <em>Monster Hunter Wilds</em> currently does not allow for cross-save progression. Your gameplay, story progress, and character creation data remain locked to whichever system you’re playing on. If you decide to hop from PC to PlayStation 5, for example, you must start a new game, a new hunter, and grind through the story and monster hunts a second time.</p><hr><p><em>Monster Hunter Wilds</em> is available now on PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series X|S. If you don’t have a buddy or two to hunt with, the game’s camp lobbies allow for up to 100 players simultaneously, and you can party up with any of them, so long as you have crossplay enabled!</p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
