              <p>The Google Pixel 9a Smartphone emphasizes camera capabilities and AI features, as well as a high-quality battery, in a 6.3-inch Android smartphone that will remain simple to carry. You receive an unlocked 5G smartphone with 8 GB of memory and 128 GB of storage, allowing you to run all your usual apps and store a large number of pictures and videos. The screen supports a maximum refresh rate of 120Hz, providing smoother scrolling and animation while navigating apps, feeds, and video games. Plus, it has IP68 water- and dust-resistance, a scratch-resistant screen, and a solid frame that protects against water and dust exposure and can withstand small drops.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6717/">Click here to purchase the Google Pixel 9a Smartphone at $399, down from $499, which is a $100 discount and a 20% reduction.</a></p>

<h2>A versatile smartphone with plenty of AI-centric features</h2>
<p>Pixel Cameras are designed to take great photographs, and once you have taken a picture, you can use the camera’s A.I. to further refine the image if you want greater control. The rear wide-angle and ultra-wide-angle cameras enable users to capture large vistas and tight compositions, and features such as Add Me and Best Take allow users to salvage a group shot that includes individuals who may have blinked or were outside the frame.</p>
<p>Macro Focus lets you zoom in on items such as textures, plants, and very small objects, so their finer details become apparent. AI photo editing lets you remove distractions and adjust lighting to be consistent throughout the image, without exporting to a separate editor.</p>



<p>The Pixel 9a’s battery life is powered by Adaptive Battery and rated for more than 30 hours of use on a single charge. If needed, Extreme Battery Saver can extend battery life to approximately 100 hours by limiting the number of lower-priority apps running in the background while conserving power. Fast Wired Charging lets you quickly recharge the battery when you do not have access to a charger for an extended period, and Wireless Charging lets you place the phone on a compatible wireless pad rather than searching for a charging cable.</p>
<p>The Google Pixel 9a Smartphone offers numerous features, including durability, security, and long-term support. Its IP68 rating and reinforced design protect against dust and liquids, as well as damage from drops. Safety features enable the detection of potential theft, automatically lock your data, and assist in detecting a car accident and initiating emergency calls. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6717/">At a discounted price of $399, reduced from the original list price of $499, the Pixel 9a offers significant value in a small-footprint 6.3-inch frame.</a></p>

<h2>Impressive Performance</h2>

Additionally, the processor features a full suite of Ryzen technologies such as Precision Boost 2 and Precision Boost Overdrive to take the experience even further. The former intelligently raises CPU clock speeds to deliver maximum performance, while the latter pushes it further when your system can handle it. Translation? Fast speeds with strong power for heavy tasks.</p>



<p>The chip is built for the AM4 socket, so it plays nicely with a wide range of motherboards. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6845/">At just over $200, you’re getting incredible performance with stunning graphics for all your entertainment and creative tasks</a>.

              <p>Controllers can make or break your gaming experience. After all, you rely on these gadgets to find your way around in digital worlds, fight battles, explore, and more. If you’re experiencing persistent stick drift, poor connectivity, and unresponsiveness from your current option, it’s time for an upgrade.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6462/">Right now, you can grab the latest Xbox wireless gaming controller in carbon black at a sweet 25% discount for $49.</a> Several other options are discounted too, but the prices may vary. For instance, the stunning Heart Breaker version with vibrant patterns is sitting at $59, while the Shock Blue option is going for $52.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6462/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Gives You a Competitive Edge</h2>
<p>The controller features a modern design with sculpted surfaces and refined geometry for enhanced comfort during gameplay. Textured grips on the triggers, bumpers, and back case make it easy to lock onto targets and stay on them, while the new hybrid D-pad offers incredibly accurate yet familiar input that gives you a competitive edge. Additionally, if the standard layout doesn’t quite work for you, or you simply want more control over the way you play, you can also customize button mappings with the Xbox Accessories app. It lets you tweak controls according to your playstyle, offering accessibility and increased comfort, which can eventually lead to better performance.</p>
<p>Those who like to show cool in-game moves and strategies off will appreciate the new Share button, too. With this, you can take screenshots and record with just a single click. There’s a 3.5mm audio headset jack to connect headphones for easier communication, as well.</p>



<p>Compatibility-wise, the controller plays nicely with Windows, Android, iOS, Fire TV Sticks, Smart TVs, and VR Headsets. You have the option to plug in directly via the USB-C port for a quick setup, or go wireless using Bluetooth for cable-free gaming across all your favorite devices. Maybe use it with your console for gaming on the go, and switch to a bigger screen when you want to enjoy a more immersive gaming experience, especially with friends.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6462/">The console is now down to just $49, after Amazon knocked a nice $16 off its retail price.</a> Several colors are going for less, so there are options to choose from. You can pick the one that best fits your gaming aesthetics. It’s important to note that the discount is only around for a short time. We’re not expecting it to last more than a day, so it’s best to grab it as soon as you can. Once it’s gone, we can’t guarantee that the controller will be this affordable again.</p>
