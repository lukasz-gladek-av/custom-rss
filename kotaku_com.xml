Two points often brought up by players are that these crossovers remain legal in the Standard Format, so dedicated players who want to remain competitive and not miss out still need to partake. Also, the cards themselves haven’t changed. It’s the same machines printing designs on the same cardboard as in-universe sets which retail for $5.50, just with extra licensing fees attached. </p><figure id="" data-id="a04543a69c6bbb3b8452a9bb640fbe05" data-recommend-id="image://a04543a69c6bbb3b8452a9bb640fbe05" data-format="png" data-width="1379" data-height="906" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A screenshot shows scalper prices on eBay for Spider-Man sets.

And it’s easy to see why when the cards still immediately sell out after becoming available for pre-order.

Pre-orders for <em>Final Fantasy</em> collector boxes are now listed for around $650 on eBay, while the <em>Spider-Man</em> ones are upwards of $700.</p><p>It’s a bummer that MTG prices are spiking at the exact moment when Universes Beyond crossovers might bring in new or returning players. Some of my friends are lapsed fans and I lobbied them to go in on a play booster box of <em>Final Fantasy</em> for a chill draft when the set drops in June. The universal response upon sharing a screenshot of the BestBuy pre-order page prices in the group chat was “hell no.” I imagine it’s even tougher for any kids without tons of pocket change or who aren’t secretly playing <em>MTG</em> like a stock market in their spare time. </p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
