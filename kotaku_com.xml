                  The best fitness tracker for everyday.
                </p><div>
              
              <p>Fitness trackers solve the accountability problem that derails workout consistency by providing objective data on activity levels, sleep quality and health metrics that self-assessment consistently misjudges. The <strong>Fitbit Charge 6 is the company’s most advanced fitness band</strong> through refined sensors, expanded app integration and comprehensive health monitoring that rivals smartwatches costing twice as much.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5344/">At $99, down from $159, this flagship tracker has hit a record-low price </a>on Amazon for Black Friday while including six months of Fitbit Premium membership that unlocks advanced analytics and personalized guidance. The <strong>38% discount</strong> makes serious fitness tracking accessible to casual exercisers who want data-driven insights without smartwatch complexity or expense.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5344/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>



<h2>Best in Class Tracker</h2>
<p>The Bluetooth-enabled heart rate transmission feature means that your<strong> real-time heart rate information</strong> can be directly transferred to compatible exercise equipment in the gym, such as treadmills, ellipticals, and stationary bicycles, in order to accurately determine the number of calories that you’ve burned.</p>
<p>The use of your exercise equipment and your personal health tracker means that you don’t have to wear the uncomfortable chest strap monitors offered by the gym, and spin classes are immensely improved when the bike computer shows you your actual heart rate zones, rather than approximate averages.</p>



<p><strong>Integration with the Google app enables you to manage Maps, Wallet, and YouTube Music</strong> right on your wrist. The seamless connectivity offered by the Google ecosystem enables you to access your walking and cycling directions without having to refer to your phone. The functionality also enables you to make contactless payments using your Google Wallet when checking out. The integration with the Google app sets the Charge 6 apart from other models, including the earlier Fitbit models, because they worked in isolation from the technology ecosystem.</p>
<p>The<strong> GPS feature provides mapping and pace analysis for outdoor running, walking, and biking activities</strong> without the need for connectivity, making it possible to exercise using the phone in a phone-free manner. The GPS in the phone works accurately like a running watch using multi-satellite technology that keeps the lock despite tree coverage and buildings. The <strong>maps provided after exercise offer the accurate routes, pace, and zones</strong> corresponding to different segments.</p>



<p><strong>Heart rate monitoring</strong> enables the observation of resting heart rate trends that may signify an improvement in cardiovascular performance and the onset of overtraining, and the feature related to sleeping enables the monitoring and evaluation of light, deep, and REM sleep stages. The optical heart rate sensor provides constant contact using the flexible band, enabling the fitment of different wrists using the provided small and large bands.</p>
<p>The<strong> bundle comes with an included six-month subscription to the service</strong>: This service has several advanced features, such as in-depth sleep tools with personalized advice, exercise plans with different difficulty levels, mindfulness exercises designed for stress relief, and health charts that enable tracking long-term trends. Regular members would have access to readiness scores, which provide an overall readiness indicator through the integration of scores related to their sleeping, activity, and Heart Rate Variability. The cost would be $9.99 a month, and the service would be worth $60.</p>
<p>The<strong> battery duration of a week ensures the use of the tracker continuously and 24/7,</strong> without the need to remove the tracker every night and undergo the process of frequent recharging, like in the case of other smart watches. The battery can be quickly recharged and it takes only about two hours to do so in case it needs recharging, even though the tracker can be recharged on a weekly basis when the user takes a shower.</p>
<p>With the Fitbit Charge 6 at just $99, you get the ability to wireless heart rate broadcast, integration with the Google app, GPS, health monitoring, six months of health and fitness insights through the health and fitness service, and a battery life up to seven days on a charge, all at 38% lower than the usual cost and available on Black Friday.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/samsung-quietly-supplies-amazon-millions-of-galaxy-buds-3-pro-to-clear-stock-now-at-new-all-time-low-2000647746</link>

              <p>Apple and Samsung battle across smartphones, tablets and increasingly in the wireless earbuds category where both companies push technological boundaries through annual releases. The <strong>Galaxy Buds 3 Pro compete directly with the new AirPods Pro 3</strong>&nbsp;and matches capabilities in active noise cancellation and AI-powered features that define premium earbuds in 2024.</p>
<p>At <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4703/">$159, down from $249, Samsung’s flagship earbuds</a> undercut Apple’s $249 retail pricing by $90 during Black Friday on Amazon and creates an obvious choice for value-conscious buyers. The decision becomes even clearer for Android smartphone owners who benefit from Samsung’s ecosystem integration that Apple deliberately restricts on non-iOS devices.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4703/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Noise Cancellation Capable of Thinking on Its Own</h2>
<p>The <strong>adaptive active noise cancellation powered by Galaxy AI constantly monitors the environment</strong> and changes the strength of the filter on its own, without the need to switch between fixed settings. When you leave the quiet offices and enter the bustling street, the intensity of the noise-cancelling effect changes on its own, and when you enter the restaurant, you are no longer in a bubble. By contrast, the need to switch between different modes on the typical ANC earbuds means you are forced to use the technology in a way that always slightly misses the mark.</p>



<p>The reworked stem-style design and ability to personalize the blade lights help differentiate the product and offer an improved fit over some models in the past lineup, namely the bean-shaped Galaxy Buds, where there was an occasional fit issue related to insecurity when engaging in vigorous dynamic action. The stem style enables leverage, keeping the earbuds in the proper location when running, working out, and engaging in other actions where stemless models are dislodged. The lights help personalize the product through custom color and patterning, reflecting the user’s personality, and making the earbuds themselves rather than the phone the fashion statement.</p>
<p><strong>Sound optimization using the Adaptive Equalizer examines the fit of the earbuds in your ear</strong> and optimizes the audio response. In cases where the audio leaks because the fit isn’t tight, the EQ adds bass, and in cases where the fit is tight, the bass reduces because too much would cause muddy tones. These adjustments occur, in effect, on their own when wearing the earbuds.</p>



<p>The <strong>Real-Time Interpreter feature functions by facilitating the direct conversation</strong> and translation process using the earbuds when interacting with people who don’t speak English, and the translations appear on your phone screen. The use of an AI Real-Time Interpreter feature when traveling internationally gains even less relevance in situations where you need directions, order food, and hold business conversations in foreign languages.</p>
<p>The intuitive touch controls make programming gesture controls available for the functions in accordance with your priorities, rather than adopting the pre-programmed settings provided by Samsung. Customization options include double-tap functionality for triggering the voice assistant, triple-tap functionality for skipping songs, and long press functionality for switching between ANC settings, according to your priority functions.</p>
<p>The <strong>IP57 water and dust resistance offered by the earbuds</strong> protects against the type of perspired moisture in the gym, rain, and accidental splashes, all accomplished without the fear that typically undermines great-sounding earbuds when they come into contact with moisture, driving up the cost of quality earbuds in the first place. The double warranty on the Amazon product protects against typical replacements, double the typical warranty periods and ensures its quality outweighs the cost upfront.</p>
<p>The Samsung Galaxy Buds 3 Pro are available on Black Friday at 36% off the regular price and come with Adaptive ANC, AI sound optimization, real-time translations, customizable controls, an IP57 water resistant rating, and a two-year warranty all in a $159 package. The $90 price gap in the AirPods Pro 3, courtesy of Samsung, means there’s no contest here when it comes to choosing the right wireless earbuds.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/sony-goes-zero-profit-on-dualsense-edge-controller-pro-gamers-can-snag-it-at-all-time-low-2000647737</link>

              <p>Casual gamers find complete satisfaction with standard <em>DualSense</em> controllers (currently hitting record-low prices during Black Friday on Amazon) which deliver good value for typical gaming needs. Dedicated players pursuing competitive advantages against skilled opponents require the enhanced customization that separates good performance from elite execution.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5850/">At $169, down from $199, the DualSense Edge costs approximately three times more</a> than standard controllers but provides <strong>true personalization capabilities that genuinely elevate gameplay for serious PS5 fans</strong> facing competition online. This record-low Black Friday price on Amazon represents unprecedented savings that didn’t materialize during either of the past two Prime Day events.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5850/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Adjustable Triggers That Match Your Playstyle</h2>
<p>The <strong>ability to customize the trigger travel distance</strong> means you can configure the distance you need to pull the L2 and R2 triggers before reaching the maximum activation, resulting in dramatic effects on shooting games where milliseconds make the difference between winning and losing. Using short triggers means you can minimize the travel range which results in distances activated the moment they make contact, similar to the effect of using a mouse on ultra-fast shooting in Call of Duty and other shooting games like Apex Legends. Medium triggers offer optimal performance on shooting games that use reaction and accuracy while long triggers offer the same experience on racing games.</p>
<p>The i<strong>nterchangeable stick caps are available in three variations</strong>, namely standard, high dome and low dome, each impacting the touch and leverage on the sticks according to the type of games you play. The high dome stickcaps allow you optimal leverage when aiming in first-person shooting games, where the slightest misaim could mean the difference between a hit and a miss. The low dome stickcaps, on the other hand, allow gamers quick turns when engaging in fighting and sports video games where the sticks need rapid turns.</p>



<p>The use of the <strong>back buttons enables the inclusion of two programmable paddles</strong> that can be accessed with the middle fingers without compromising the hold on the sticks, hence the functionality of the buttons. The use of the back buttons also enables the execution of bunny hops and the ability to execute a drop shot with the ability to accurately aim, an ability that differentiates professional play from normal play.</p>
<p><strong>Dead-zone customization</strong> corresponds to the length the sticks need to travel in order to register an input, mitigating the issue of the sticks drifting over time. A small dead-zone setting provides the greatest responsiveness when using precise inputs, and large dead zones prevent unintended movement when the sticks are loose. The curve settings correspond to the stick movement and in-game sensitivit, and exponential and linear settings offer dramatic changes in aiming.</p>



<p>The<strong> carrying case provides protection for the controller when transported</strong> in addition to the organization it provides for the stick caps, the back button, and the USB cord. The braided USB-C cord ensures a seamless connection, eliminating the latency that comes with wireless play, making it ideal in the world of competitive gaming where milliseconds matter.</p>
<p><strong>Profile switching provides the ability to store numerous full configurations</strong> on the controller, all activated at the touch of a controller button, even when the apps on the watch are locked.</p>
<p>At $169, the <strong>PlayStation DualSense Edge</strong> delivers adjustable triggers, interchangeable stick caps, programmable back buttons, dead zone customization and replaceable stick modules at 15% below retail this Black Friday. The premium over standard DualSense justifies itself through customization that improves competitive performance rather than just adding luxury features.</p>
