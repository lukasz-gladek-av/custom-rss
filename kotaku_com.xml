              <p><i>Call of Duty</i> has been such a staple of gaming that it’s hard to imagine a time when it wasn’t a household name. But way before its yearly release cycle kicked in and modern and futuristic settings became <i>CoD</i>’s bread and butter, even before the franchise made its debut and was largely about simulating World War II battles, there was <i>Medal of Honor</i>. And according to EA’s Vince Zampella (<i>Battlefield</i>, <i>Titanfall</i>, <i>Apex Legends</i>), Activision brought <i>CoD</i> into existence to put <i>Medal of Honor</i> in its crosshairs. Mission accomplished.</p> <p>“The only reason <i>Call of Duty </i>exists is because EA were dicks,” Zampella said in an interview with <a href="https://www.gq-magazine.co.uk/article/battlefield-6-vince-zampella"><i>GQ</i></a> (<a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-only-reason-call-of-duty-exists-is-because-ea-were-dicks-battlefield-boss-vince-zampella-says">h/t <i>IGN</i></a>). An FPS OG, Zampella was the lead designer of <i>Medal of Honor: Allied Assault</i>, and would go on to co-found Infinity Ward.</p> <p>In what sounds like a dispatch from an alternate universe, Infinity Ward was originally hoping to create more <i>Medal of Honor </i>games. That didn’t happen. EA decided to be “dicks,” and chose to handle things on its own with <i>Medal of Honor</i> (that wouldn’t end up working out well). At the time, Infinity Ward, now without its franchise of choice in its grasp, pivoted to pitching Activision on a new historical shooter, <i>Call of Duty</i>.</p> <p>Zampella would later join EA, creating <i>Titanfall </i>and <i>Apex Legends</i> in his role at Respawn Entertainment. He’s now in charge of <i>Battlefield</i>, which is celebrating its sixth mainline release.</p>

              <p>If you’re after a solid everyday laptop that’s easy to carry around and does not cost you an arm and a leg, Lenovo Ideapads are an excellent choice to consider. Depending on the specs and model you’re after, you’d typically expect to spend over a thousand dollars on one. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4756/">But right now, Amazon has slashed the price of the 15-inch Ideapad Slim 3 to $579, which is a huge 71% off its usual price.</a></p>
<p>You’re saving $1,420 on this powerhouse, but the deal is only around for a short time. Amazon has marked it as a limited-time offer, so it likely won’t stick around for long.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4756/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Brighter Visuals, Powerful Processor</h2>
<p>The Slim lineup essentially features sleek and light entry-level laptops that are designed for everyday use. This model gets you Intel’s 13th Gen Core i5-13420H processor that offers plenty of power for regular work, browsing, streaming, and even some light creativity. There’s a 16GB RAM to prevent frustrating slowdowns, plus 512GB SSD M.2 PCIe NVMe storage to save your entire multimedia library and programs without feeling cramped. Think thousands of photos, a wide range of documents, your favorite movies, and so much more. And since it’s SSD, you will also enjoy faster boot times to get on with the day without any delay.</p>
<p>The display is just a 15.3-inch screen with a 1920×1200 resolution for clear, detailed visuals. It’s bright enough to bring everything on the screen to life without that oversaturated feel. The Intel UHD Graphics take things up a notch by keeping it all smooth and crisp. You’re also getting a 720p webcam for clear video calls, along with dual mics and stereo speakers that make you sound just as good.</p>



<p>Connectivity options include Wi-Fi 6, Bluetooth 5.2, two USB-A ports, one USB-C port with DisplayPort and Power Delivery, an HDMI output, an SD card reader, and a headphone/mic combo jack. Basically, you really won’t need to invest in extra adapters. And despite all these features, the machine is quite slim and portable. In fact, it’s 10% slimmer than the previous generation!</p>
<p>Altogether, the IdeaPad Slim 3 laptop is a great option for work professionals, students, and casual users. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4756/">This deal lets you grab it for less than $600, which is quite a rare sight</a>. Just be sure to grab it before the price goes back up. We don’t expect to see another discount this big before Black Friday.</p>

              <p>Apple products can come a little pricier then some of its peers. Though, most users find them worth it for their reliability, ease-of-use, or, in some cases, because you bought an iPhone 4s over a decade ago and now have just gotten too used to the Apple ecosystem to migrate out of it. No shame, I’m describing myself too. Apple stuff is simple, it does what we expect them to too, and it integrates easily with all our other Apple crap. That’s why its always nice to see when some of these iPhones, Macs, or AirPods get hit with a big discount.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4755/">Right now, Amazon has the Apple AirPods Max over-hear headphones on sale for 22% off</a>. Now, 22% may not sound like a lot at first, but that shakes out to a savings of $119. It brings the price down from $549 to just $430 for a limited time.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4755/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<p>The Apple AirPods Max are a stylish pair of over-the-ear headphones which are capable of high-fidelity audio thanks to the help of the H1 chip alongside Apple’s dynamic driver. These headphones are able to produce sound that can adjust itself in real-time to follow along with you. It does so by tracking your head position so it feels like you are in the pit at your favorite concert venue. And with support for Dolby Atmos, you’ll be hearing rich and detailed audio for certain songs, movies, or shows.</p>
<h2>Active Noise Cancellation</h2>
<p>Enjoy pro-level active noise cancelling when using the Apple AirPods Max so you can focus on only the sound you want to hear. Turn off the distracting noises coming from your environment, whether that’s a loud roar of a plane turbine or a chatty office of co-workers.</p>



<p>Battery life is reliable. The Apple AirPods Max will grant you with a solid 20 hours of listening time off of a single charge. That should be enough to get your through your flight or day at the office, no problem.</p>
<p>The limited time discount isn’t available with all color options unfortunately. If you were eyeing either the orange or starlight versions of Apple’s premium line of headphones, you’re in luck. Those are the two seeing the full $119 discount. The other color options are all still on sale, just not for as much. You can pick up the black or blue model of the Apple AirPods Max for $49 off at $500 even or the purple version for $20 off at $529.</p>
