              <p>If you want to play the latest AAA titles with immersive visuals, or work on heavy creative projects like 4K editing or 3D rendering without pushing your machine to its limit, investing in a dedicated gaming laptop makes a lot of sense. The best options out there, however, don’t usually come cheap. In fact, those packed with next-gen internals and high-end specs often run well over $3,000. Thankfully, that changes today.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5553/">Amazon has dropped the price of the Asus TUF F16 Gaming Laptop to $2,200. That’s after a massive 46% discount off its original MSRP</a>. It’s highly rated on the platform, and this early Black Friday deal is offering the perfect opportunity to snag it up without paying the full price. Best of all, the laptop comes with a bunch of free accessories that are sure to improve your gaming experience even further.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5553/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Run All Your Favorite Titles, or Push Creative Boundaries</h2>
<p>Starting off with the power; you’re getting the Intel Core i7-14650HX processor inside, which is capable of delivering turbo speeds up to 5.2GHz across 16 cores and 24 threads. You can trust it to not flinch even when you’re working on multiple resource-intensive tasks or gaming for long.</p>
<p>The processor is paired with the NVIDIA GeForce RTX 5060 GPU (8GB GDDR7). It’s much more powerful than the RTX 4070 generation, and you can expect smoother performance with advanced ray tracing and DLSS 4, even for the upcoming games. There’s a whopping 64GB of DDR5 RAM (5600MHz) to help you multitask during your busy days with ease. This is more than enough to use a bunch of applications at the same time, have multiple tabs open simultaneously, streaming while gaming; all without slowing down.</p>



<p>Then you have a 4TB SSD that’s not just big; it’s massive. You’ll have enough space to keep all your favorite titles, media content, and work documents in a single place. Future downloads will be covered, too!</p>
<p>As for the display, the laptop flaunts its 16-inch FHD+ panel (1920 x 1200) with a 165Hz refresh rate and 16:10 aspect ratio. There’s support for NVIDIA G-SYNC and Adaptive-Sync for an even more immersive experience that pulls you into action. The machine is also quite sturdy and comes with a built-in cooling technology that keeps the temperature in check as you work or play.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5553/">The free accessory kit includes Windows 11 Pro (pre-installed), data cable organizers (6-pack), a gaming mouse, and an RGB mechanical feel gaming keyboard.</a></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><i><span>Pokémon</span></i><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-pokopia-animal-crossing-switch-2-nintendo-direct-2000625331"><i><span> Pokopia</span></i></a><span> is making a play for the cozy game market next year by giving us what is essentially an </span><i><span>Animal Crossing </span></i><span>game in the </span><i><span>Pokémon </span></i><span>universe. You play as a Ditto that transforms into a human and attempts to spruce up an island until it’s a suitable community for Pokémon. Most of these monsters look the same as they ever have, but in a new trailer, we learned the game will introduce new forms for some old Pokémon, including a white Pikachu that’s never been in the main games.</span></p> <p><span>This news came as part of an extended </span><i><span>Pokopia </span></i><span>trailer that gave fans an overview of how Ditto will work with its growing Pokémon community to create a new home for them on an abandoned island. Some of the big announcements included that Ditto can transform into other Pokémon like Lapras and Dragonite to get around the island faster, the citizens of your island will give you quests that seem to fill out the mysteries of the island, and through Gameshare you can play cooperatively with others, even across Switch console generations, without each person having to own the game.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><span>But perhaps most excitingly, throughout the trailer we saw a few new forms for monsters like a moss-covered Snorlax, a graying Tangrowth that acts as the game’s Professor, a paint-covered Smeargle, and most mysteriously, a white PIkachu that is shown powering up the street lights on the island.</span></p>  <p><span>This pale, droopy-eared Pikachu is called Peakychu. It’s a female Pikachu, as you can see from her heart-shaped tail, but why does she look like she’s ill? We don’t know yet, but I want to help her however I can. Coincidentally, there was </span><a href="https://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/List_of_unused_Pok%C3%A9mon_and_character_designs#White_Pichu"><span>supposed to be a White Pichu</span></a><span> in </span><i><span>HeartGold </span></i><span>and </span><i><span>SoulSilver</span></i><span>, but it was scrapped in favor of the spiky-eared variant that made it into the RPGs as an event giveaway. Given that some of these monsters’ standard forms are probably recruitable villagers, it’s good that the actual characters have some defining features. I wouldn’t be surprised if these variants end up in games like </span><i><span>Pokémon Go</span></i><span> or the RPGs as a bit of cross-promotion. At the very least, </span><i><span>Pokopia </span></i><span>seems to have some intriguing mysteries happening alongside all the town management. We’ll find out more about Peakychu and these other forms when </span><i><span>Pokopia </span></i><span>launches on March 5.</span></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>The first <i>Red Dead</i> <i>Redemption</i> seems to be anything but dead based on a recent rating by the folks over at the ESRB. As one of those iconic open-world games of the Xbox 360 era, that’s good news for those who remember it fondly and those of us who stubbornly still haven’t gotten around to playing it.</p> <p>With <a href="https://www.esrb.org/ratings/40987/red-dead-redemption/">an M-rating</a> indicating all the messy blood and gore a Rockstar game typically comes with (<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/new-red-dead-redemption-rating-suggests-remaster-on-the-way-to-ps5-xbox-series-xs-and-switch-2">h/t <i>Eurogamer</i></a>), the filing indicates the presence of zombified action as well, so it seems natural to expect <i>Red Dead</i>’s popular <i>Undead Nightmare</i> expansion to be included:</p>

 <p>This is an open-world action-adventure game in which players assume the role of a reformed criminal capturing the remnants of an outlaw gang and combatting a zombie plague.</p> <p>The first <i>Red Dead Redemption</i> received Switch and PS4 versions in 2023, and a PC release a year later, though it did not come to Xbox Series consoles.</p> <p>The game’s highly praised sequel, arguably more available due to its backwards compatibility of modern consoles and the 2019 PC release, has also been slow to receive any kind of major graphical update in the way <i>Grand Theft Auto V</i> did only two years following its premiere on PS3 and Xbox 360. Then again, <i>RDR2</i> is still a visual treat several years after its release, while its predecessor is certainly long in the tooth by now.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/gaming-chair-is-selling-for-pennies-amazon-drops-4-5-rated-comfort-model-to-record-low-2000643991</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/gaming-chair-is-selling-for-pennies-amazon-drops-4-5-rated-comfort-model-to-record-low.1352545/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Long gaming sessions or workdays at your desk lead to back pain, neck strain and overall discomfort that ruins your focus and enjoyment. Right now, the <em>N-Gen</em> gaming chair costs less than most standard office chairs you’d find at furniture stores which makes zero sense when you compare the features.</p>
<p>Amazon dropped <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5562/">this early Black Friday deal to $99, down from $139, which marks a record low for a chair with a 4.5 star rating</a> from over 1,600 buyers. This pricing puts ergonomic support, adjustable comfort and durable construction within reach of anyone who spends serious time at a desk.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5562/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Ergonomic Features That Prevent Pain</h2>
<p>The high-back racing design <strong>supports you from your tailbone right up to your shoulders</strong>&nbsp;and caters to the full length of your spine, rather than just one section. That comprehensive coverage is important because when you slouch in those unsupported chairs, it creates a domino effect, or ripple, of posture problems originating in your lower back and radiating upward. When seated for prolonged periods, the removable headrest cushions your neck to avoid the forward head posture that causes tension headaches and shoulder pain. A <strong>lower back pillow targets the lumbar region</strong>&nbsp;where most people have chronic discomfort from sitting, with the curve support that keeps your spine naturally aligned.</p>



<p>The <strong>pull-out footrest turns the chair into a reclining station</strong> where you can take breaks without leaving your setup. You can lean back during loading screens, between work calls or when you just need to let your eyes rest and stretch. This integrated footrest eliminates the need for an additional ottoman or footstool, freeing up space while giving you the option of bringing your legs up and improving circulation.</p>



<p>High-density foam cushions keep their shape and support over months and years of daily use. Cheap chairs flatten out in no time and you end up sitting on a barely padded surface that feels just about like a wooden bench. The breathable PU leather covering remains comfortable against your skin without the sticky feeling that develops with lower-quality materials on hot days or during long sessions of gaming.</p>
<p>Adjustable comfort comes through multiple mechanisms that let you customize the chair to your body: The recline function with linkage armrests means the armrests move with you when you lean back, maintaining proper arm support in any position. Height adjustment uses an <strong>SGS-certified gas lift rated to support up to 300 pounds safely</strong>, and gives you confidence that the mechanism won’t fail suddenly and drop you to the floor. The <strong>360-degree swivel and smooth-rolling wheels</strong> let you pivot between monitors, reach for items or move around your space.</p>
<p>Assembly usually takes about 20 to 30 minutes with basic tools and is simple enough which means you won’t require any pro help. The chair comes complete with all the hardware you’ll need, along with clear instructions on attaching the base, mounting the seat, installing the backrest, and connecting the armrests. Once assembled, the chair feels solid and substantial rather than rickety or questionable like self-assembly furniture sometimes does.</p>
<p>At $99, you’re paying less than basic office chairs from big box stores while getting adjustable features, ergonomic support, and build quality that typically costs $200 or more.</p>
