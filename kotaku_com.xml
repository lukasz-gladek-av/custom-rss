              <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/forza-horizon-5-is-finally-stealing-the-show-for-micros-1848034238">It’s almost time to leave behind <em>Forza Horizon 5</em>‘s Mexico</a> and journey to a brand new country. <a href="https://kotaku.com/forza-horizon-6-location-microsoft-tokyo-game-show-2000628658"><em>Forza Horizon 6</em> moves the series to Japan</a>, and it looks amazing! The new entry in Xbox’s popular car sim series arrives later this year, and we have all the useful info you might want to know about the upcoming open-world racer. Just put your seatbelt on first before speed-scrolling through this list.</p> <h2>What is <em>Forza Horizon 6</em>?</h2> <p><em>Forza Horizon 6</em> is the next installment in the <em>Forza</em> <em>Horizon </em>franchise. <a href="https://kotaku.com/forza-motorsport-8-horizon-xbox-game-pass-review-120fps-1850900323">Unlike the more serious, sim-heavy <em>Motorsport</em> games,</a> the <em>Horizon</em> titles are open-world racing games focused more on over-the-top moments, music, gorgeous locations, and arcade-y fun. This time around, <em>Forza Horizon 6</em> brings the franchise to Japan, a location fans have been wanting for years. You’ll be able to explore the urban streets of Tokyo, the suburbs outside of the town, and plenty of open land and rural spaces far away from the city. And like in past games, you can choose to focus on big races to level up and unlock more challenges, or you can just chill, cruise, and jam out to music.</p>

 <h2>What’s different about this latest entry?</h2> <p>Beyond the new location, <em>Forza Horizon 6</em> is shaking things up and swapping out the main character. In <em>Horizon 6</em>, you won’t be playing as the “superstar” racer featured in the last few games. Instead, you’re a tourist visiting Japan who gets involved in the Horizon Festival and all the racing and car culture. That means you have to earn entry to the festival and its activities and slowly work your way up from driving rust buckets to supercars.</p>  <h2>How big is the map in <em>Forza Horizon 6</em>?</h2> <p>Very big! In fact, this is the biggest map that Playground Games has created for a <em>Forza Horizon</em> game. <a href="https://kotaku.com/forza-horizon-6-biggest-map-japan-open-world-size-comparison-2026-ps5-xbox-2000628855"><em>Forza Horizon 6</em> art director Don Arceta claimed in an interview</a> that <em>Horizon 6</em>‘s digital Japan is the biggest map in the history of the series, and Tokyo is the largest city the team has ever built. And as you explore this massive location, you’ll fill up a journal, a new feature in <em>Horizon 6</em> that helps you track everything you do and all the places you visit while playing the game.</p>

 <h2>How many cars are available at launch?</h2> <p><a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2026/01/22/forza-horizon-6-developer-direct-breakdown-interview/">According to<em> Xbox Wire,</em> there will be around 550 cars</a> to collect and drive in <em>Forza Horizon 6</em> at launch. That number will go up over time as the devs add more cars to the game. As for the car on the cover of the game, that’s the Toyota 2025 GR GT Prototype.</p>

 <h2>Can I play <em>Horizon 6</em> online with my friends?</h2> <p>Yup! Like earlier games in the series, <em>Forza Horizon 6</em> supports multiplayer with friends as well as random players. And new to this entry, players will be able to build new tracks together with their friends. There will also be car meets you can hang out at with friends, and a location that lets players build their own personal home and race track. These are both new features for <em>Horizon 6</em>.</p> <h2>What is <em>Forza Horizon 6</em>‘s release date?</h2> <p><em>Forza Horizon 6</em> is launching on May 19 for Xbox Series X/S and PC, and&nbsp;will be available day one on Game Pass Ultimate. Xbox is also holding the game hostage, like so many publishers. If you spend extra on the Premium Edition, you’ll be able to play <em>Forza Horizon 6</em> four days early, on May 15.</p>

 <h2>Will <em>Forza Horizon 6</em> be available on PS5?</h2> <p>Yes, but not at launch. Playground has confirmed that it is working on a PS5 port of <em>Forza Horizon 6</em>, but it won’t be available until sometime later in 2026.</p> <h2>Wait, where are the goblins and magic and swords?</h2> <p>Ohhh, you’re looking for Playground’s other open-world game, <a href="https://kotaku.com/fable-reboot-features-open-world-release-date-fall-xbox-ps5-2000662295"><em>Fable</em>, which is also launching this year. Sorry to have wasted your time</a>.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Final Fantasy VII Remake On Switch 2 Is A Good Way To Play A Great Game]]></title>
            <link>https://kotaku.com/final-fantasy-7-remake-switch-2-handheld-performance-2000661851</link>
            <guid>1413748</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>The latest version of <em>Final Fantasy VII Remake Intergrade</em> brings a 2021 PlayStation 5 upgrade of a 2020 PS4 game to a 2025 gaming handheld hybrid in 2026. It’s a good port of a great game and suggests a bright future for third-party blockbusters on Switch 2 from publishers willing to invest the time and resources into doing it right.</p> <p>I played the new version, out January 22, for around four hours, racing back through the early section of the game in time to meet back up with Aerith and stroll through some of the more taxing areas in the early game. I was struck by two things during my brief return to the slums of Midgar. The first was just how linear, focused, and cinematic the <em>Final Fantasy VII Remake</em> is compared to its sprawling successor, <em>Rebirth</em>. It was fun, refreshing, and nostalgic—all the things that made the 2020 game worth its long wait.</p>

 <p>The second was how rarely it felt like I was playing a nerfed version <em>Final Fantasy VII Remake</em>, one compromised for a portable device (I played almost exclusively in handheld mode). It’s locked at 30fps instead of something higher but that never felt like a drag. The textures, lighting, and particle effects never drew attention for the wrong reasons. I never sat there in a boss fight or cutscene thinking, “This is fine but I wished it looked better.”</p> <figure id="attachment_2000662353" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000662353"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000662353">Digital Foundry / Square Enix</figcaption></figure> <p>It’s a vibe check backed up by technical analyses from the experts. A very thorough review of <em>Final Fantasy VII Remake Intergrade</em>‘s performance on Switch 2 <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUjYGy7cqog">by <em>Digital Foundry</em></a> finds that it’s weaker than the PS5 version in some areas but generally better than the PS4 one across the board. There is no infamously low-res texture eternally waiting to load on Cloud’s 7th Heaven apartment door. Pop-in is mostly a non-issue. The lighting in many scenes is more detailed than in the PS4 version as well.</p>

 <p>The only real place the Switch 2 port falters is when it comes to hair in handheld mode. It’s a small issue but a noticeable one for a game whose hero’s most defining feature is a Chocobo’s nest of spikey blond hair. From Tifa’s long ponytail to Aerith’s brunette braids, there’s often dithering and fuzziness. Some of the UI elements occasionally feel especially small or hard to read in handheld mode as well. It didn’t shatter my immersion but the game isn’t completely free of small downgrades here or there that remind you you aren’t playing on one of the high-end home consoles (the Switch 2 version arrived alongside the Xbox Series X/S ports).</p>

 <p>If you’re someone who never owned a PS4, PS5, or PC that could play <em>Final Fantasy VII Remake</em>, I’d recommend the Switch 2 version without hesitation. If the Switch 2 is the only console you’ve ever owned, I might even call it a “must buy” relative to the rest of the console’s library right now. PlayStation owners take access to games like this for granted. For Nintendo fans, it’s still a special treat, and hopefully the first of many.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[It Took An Xbox Showcase To Get A Rare Look Inside The Makers Of Pokémon]]></title>

              <p><span>We live in a post-platform world. Xbox, PlayStation, and Nintendo are no longer treating each other like they’re adversaries of the “he who must not be named” variety in their marketing material. Though console warriors are still fighting that battle in comments sections like soldiers who don’t know the war has ended, </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/halo-remake-campaign-evolved-playstation-cross-play-2000638951"><i><span>Halo </span></i><span>is coming to PlayStation</span></a><span>, so the war is over. Not only does that mean we get games on more platforms than we once did, but we also get some brainbreaking moments, like today when </span><i><span>Pokémon </span></i><span>developer Game Freak was featured </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/xbox-developer-direct-fable-forza-horizon-6-game-freak-2000662291"><span>in an Xbox showcase</span></a><span>, and we got a rare look into the studio that made Pikachu.</span></p>  <p><span>The Tokyo office Game Freak operates out of has been the company’s home </span><a href="https://officesnapshots.com/2020/11/09/game-freak-offices-tokyo/"><span>since 2020</span></a><span> when it moved to be closer to Nintendo’s own offices in the same building, called Kanda Square. It’s been about as long since we last got a good look inside the company’s office, whose decor is based on the Kanto region of the original </span><i><span>Pokémon</span></i> <i><span>Red </span></i><span>and </span><i><span>Green</span></i><span>. While the studio was showing off its upcoming action RPG </span><i><span>Beast of Reincarnation </span></i><span>in today’s video presentation, </span><i><span>Pokémon </span></i><span>got namedropped several times over footage of the team working on the game in its Kanda Square office. The clips we see show an office that, in some rooms, looks like any other video game developer’s space, with concept art on the walls and computers in cubicles. But some rooms look much different, like one that is covered in trees to look like Kanto’s Viridian Forest.</span></p>

 <p><span>While </span><i><span>Pokémon</span></i><span>’s name was said a few times in the showcase and this room is an homage to one of its most iconic early “dungeons,” as far as I can tell there’s no sign of a Pikachu or Poké Ball in these brief glimpses into Game Freak’s inner sanctum. I understand why they wouldn’t show us shots of the team working on upcoming </span><i><span>Pokémon </span></i><span>games, but I am surprised that there’s not even a frame of iconography in these shots. That feels like a deliberate choice, perhaps to not distract from </span><i><span>Beast of Reincarnation</span></i><span>?</span></p> <p><span>The Viridian Forest backdrop does work for the upcoming Xbox/PC/PS5 game, though, as it takes place in a post-apocalyptic fantasy Japan in which nature has reclaimed much of the land. Still, it’s odd to get an intimate look inside the historically secretive studio from an Xbox showcase. It’s a shame Pikachu didn’t get to make a cameo appearance, but I sincerely doubt we’ll be seeing a </span><i><span>Pokémon </span></i><span>game on Xbox, even as the console barriers are falling down.</span></p>

            <title><![CDATA[Game Freak Addresses Your Valid Concern About How Its Non-Pokémon RPG Will Run]]></title>
            <link>https://kotaku.com/beast-of-reincarnation-game-freak-pokemon-rpg-xbox-ps5-2000662327</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><span>Game Freak showed a pretty lengthy look at its new action-RPG </span><i><span>Beast of Reincarnation</span></i><span> during today’s </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/xbox-developer-direct-fable-forza-horizon-6-game-freak-2000662291"><span>Xbox Developer Direct</span></a><span>. The studio is primarily known for its work on </span><i><span>Pokémon</span></i><span>, though. Given that recent entries like </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-scarlet-and-violet-review-nintendo-switch-1849843125"><i><span>Scarlet </span></i><span>and </span><i><span>Violet</span></i></a><span> were notorious for being pretty ugly and running very poorly on the original Switch, you might be wondering how </span><i><span>Beast of Reincarnation </span></i><span>looks as good as it does. Will it end up having similar technical troubles? Well, we won’t know for sure until the game launches in the summer, but Game Freak was recently asked this exact question.</span></p> <p><span>Speaking with game director Kota Furushima, </span><a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/beast-of-reincarnation-game-director-answers-all-our-burning-questions-about-the-pokemon-developers-upcoming-action-game"><i><span>IGN </span></i><span>asked</span></a><span> about </span><i><span>Beast of Reincarnation</span></i><span>’s ambitions after games like </span><i><span>Scarlet </span></i><span>and </span><i><span>Violet</span></i><span> and </span><i><span>Pokémon Legends: Arceus</span></i><span> struggled with performance despite not chasing nearly the same level of same fidelity or scope. Furushima’s answer might sound encouraging for </span><i><span>Beast of Reincarnation</span></i><span>, but it also feels like </span><i><span>Pokémon </span></i><span>is catching strays.</span></p>

 <blockquote><p><b>IGN: </b><span>Game Freak has received some criticism in the past few years for the performance and look of some of its 3D open world games. </span><i><span>Beast of Reincarnation</span></i><span> looks to be fairly ambitious. What would you say to those who are concerned that it might struggle in the same ways?</span></p> <p><b>Furushima:</b><span> I think when it comes to </span><i><span>Beast of Reincarnation</span></i><span>, and I guess we would regard it as the scale and the ambition of the title, when we approach game design, we’re not looking to make, say, a title of a certain level of quality. We’re looking to deliver a very specific game experience, and visual fidelity and graphics, this is something that supports that game experience, everything that goes into that. That includes things like bug fixing, optimization. Everything is there to serve the gameplay and the experience. Our focus is on that gameplay experience. Part of that, of course, is making sure that it performs really well, but our attention is more on getting the experience over to you and making sure that our vision can get to your hands and your hearts.</span></p></blockquote> <p><span>The unspoken implication here is that </span><i><span>Pokémon </span></i><span>games are not the type of “specific game experience” that requires the aforementioned bug fixes and optimization. It feels like an offshoot of the argument people who run defense for </span><i><span>Pokémon </span></i><span>games make by saying “people don’t play these games for the graphics,” as if that means they shouldn’t still aspire to not look like GameCube games.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>Elsewhere in the interview, </span><i><span>IGN </span></i><span>asks about the size of the team working on </span><i><span>Beast of Reincarnation</span></i><span> since Game Freak is a relatively small developer that is also working on </span><i><span>Pokémon </span></i><span>projects year-round. Furushima says the multi-studio headcount is “quite large,” but the actual internal Game Freak team working on </span><i><span>Beast of Reincarnation </span></i><span>is “relatively small” and mostly leading the project through direction and management.</span></p>

 <p><span>“We managed to seek out a lot of partner companies to work with us, companies, studios that are able to realize the vision of this game in the way that we wanted to make it, so we’re lucky to have a lot of people working on it externally as well,” Furushima says.</span></p>

 <p><span>It sounds like </span><i><span>Beast of Reincarnation</span></i><span> might not suffer the same technical troubles as Game Freak’s </span><i><span>Pokémon</span></i><span> games since it’s not being developed primarily internally like </span><i><span>Legends: Z-A</span></i><span> and the upcoming Gen X games. Will any of </span><i><span>Beast of Reincarnation</span></i><span>’s fidelity end up rubbing off on </span><i><span>Pokémon</span></i><span>? Who knows. </span><i><span>Beast of Reincarnation </span></i><span>is coming to PC, PS5, and Xbox Series X/S this summer.</span></p>
