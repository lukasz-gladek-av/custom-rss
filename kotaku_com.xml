In the final season, the show introduced a confusing parallel timeline where the stranded characters live normal lives, only to find out it wasn’t a parallel timeline but some sort of purgatory-like afterlife where they can all reunite. We never find out why all that weird stuff happens on the island, what the deal was with all of those numbers, or where Jacob (Mark Pellegrino) got the powers to grant immortality and leave whenever he wanted. </p><p>Erickson promises <em>Severance</em> won’t turn into <em>Lost</em>, but dances around fully committing to answering all of the show’s mysteries. “I promise the show will not literally turn into <em>Lost</em>. We won’t put them on an island and have Sawyer show up. No—we’re very conscious of that fact that we need to know where we’re going, and we need to reward people’s patience and faith.”</p><p>That <em>Severance </em>fan theories multiplying quicker than Apple can pump out episodes almost guarantees there will be questions unanswered, mainly because they were questions Erickson never posed. The series can have a satisfying ending without explaining how many departments there are in the Lumon building that houses the main cast, or why there is a <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/miss-huang-severance-season-2-apple-tv-1851738787&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/miss-huang-severance-season-2-apple-tv-1851738787">child working on the Severed Floor</a></span><em>. </em>Those mysteries are ancillary and not central to the drama of the show. But, there remain quite a few mysteries they’ll need to clear up by the end of the series if they want to avoid <em>Lost</em> levels of ignominy. </p><p>We need to know what these severed workers are actually working on, and what Lumon’s ultimate plan is. The whereabouts of Ms. Casey (Dichen Lachman) seem to be a focal point of the current season, but we also need to know if and how Lumon faked her death given the facts Mark S (Adam Scott) says he identified her body. Under no circumstance can this series end without explaining what the fuck is the deal with the goats. </p><div><p>Those are just a few of the core mysteries that need to be resolved but the time the show wraps up. Lucky for us <em>Severance </em>fans, Erickson says Season 3 shouldn’t have the nearly three-year wait Season 2 had. Let’s just hope this whole series isn’t all just happening in Kier’s comatose mind in some Lumon nursing home. </p></div></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

What happens when supernatural and unstoppable forces take over the place that is meant to be your sanctuary? How can you escape when this is where you are meant to stay? These spectres–often ghosts or something demonic—are mostly unseen, appearing only when they need to drive others out, typically seeking revenge. </p><p>Horror movies tap into the unsettling idea that something evil can lurk within our walls.They turn everyday objects and environments, like creaking floorboards or long hallways, into sources of fear. Any tragic events that occur within these confines can have ripple effects on all future residents. Let’s step inside some of the best haunted houses ever to be put on screen.</p></div></div><div><p>The visionary Guillermo del Toro helms this sumptuous Gothic melodrama with haunted house themes. The newly wed Edith Cushing moves into her husband Sir Thomas Sharpe’s mammoth yet crumbling estate, Allerdale Hall, along with his sister, Lucille. Edith warily navigates the mansion, drenched in midnight blues, where the only light comes from flickering candelabras. As she moves through the hallways, she searches for the source of the unsettling whispers and creaking floors. The ghosts are unlike any you’ve seen before—spindly creatures with red skin stretched taut over their bones, bent limbs, and dark, hollow eyes. The slow-moving, moaning creatures hold the key to the nefarious Sharpe family history. </p></div><div><p>At first, <em>Insidious </em>feels familiar, another story about a married couple (Rose Byrne and scream king Patrick Wilson) and their young children moving into a new home, only to experience unusual, supernatural occurrences—randomly blaring alarms, bloody handprints on the children’s bed, and eerie noises. James Wan meticulously crafts his horror scenes with subtlety. In one memorable scene, the camera follows Renai as she goes about the house doing mundane chores, like taking out the garbage, while the unsettling children’s song “Tiptoe Through the Tulips” warbles on a record player. </p><p>Through the window from a distance, she catches a barely noticeable shadow of a little boy in period clothing, dancing to the song. It’s little moments like these that make <em>Insidious </em>so frightening. There’s plenty of jump scares, as well, like the sudden appearance of a red-faced demon that will leave your heart in your throat. The most inventive and chilling part of <em>Insidious </em>is The Further, a dark, foggy dimension where lost souls and demonic entities wait for the living. </p></div><div><p>While director Takashi Shimizu’s Japanese original is arguably superior, he also directs the American version of <em>The Grudge</em>, and both are well worth watching. The English version follows Sarah Michelle Gellar as an American nurse who encounters a haunted house in Tokyo. The way Japanese horror depicts ghosts gives you goosebumps—long-haired, pale figures with wide, black eyes that stare at you with a laser focus, appearing out of nowhere. </p><p>One of the scariest scenes is when a ghost crawls down the stairs, its limbs contorted into jagged angles and making a god-awful croaking noise. Another appears directly on top of someone beneath the covers. <em>The Grudge</em> transforms the emotional pain of a person’s life on Earth into a curse that claims all those who enter the space where these traumas occurred—creating an endless cycle of torment.</p></div><div><p>There’s some 1970s-era cheese in <em>The Amityville Horror</em>, but it’s still one of the OG haunted house movies and a must-see. Based on a true story, the Lutz family moves into a New York home where Ronald DeFeo Jr. slaughtered his entire family. The famous arched windows truly look like eyes, as if the house is sizing up its next victims. </p><p>Satanic occurrences plague the new residents, such as being swarmed by flies, waking up at the same early hour that the DeFeos were murdered, and seeing the piercing eyes of a pig outside the second-story window. <em>The Amityville Horror</em> makes the menacing assertion that the dark events tied to the land where our homes are built, as well as the history within a house’s walls, can manifest in evil ways.</p></div><div><p>Despite being championed by Steven Spielberg and Martin Scorsese as one of the scariest movies of all time, <em>The Haunting</em> doesn’t rely on jump scares or terrifying monster reveals, unlike the hokey 1999 remake. Instead, Robert Wise’s film takes its time and revels in ambiguity, never allowing the viewer to truly know what’s behind the swaying chandeliers, the loud banging, or the sounds of a girl crying. We learn that the stately mansion does have a tragic backstory when a group is brought there for a paranormal study, including a psychic (Claire Bloom) and a lonely woman who claims to have personal experience with the supernatural (Julie Harris). </p><p>What<em> The Haunting </em>lacks in traditional frights makes up for in atmosphere: ominous low angles, a sharp monochromatic palette, and the ornate Gothic surroundings of the sprawling manor. The camera itself has a ghostly presence, observing the characters from afar with a curious tension, using widescreen to capture the lopsided rooms, always leaving us uncertain whether something strange will appear.</p></div><div><p><em>Paranormal Activity </em>became a cinematic sensation thanks to its viral marketing that included trailers with night vision clips of terrified audience members and a campaign urging people to demand the film be shown in their theaters. Similar to <em>The Blair Witch Project</em>, the identities of the actors were kept hidden, making it feel as though this footage was truly found. <em>Paranormal Activity </em>is one of the best haunted house movies because of its simplicity; most of the film is observing the couple Katie and Micah (Katie Featherson and Micah Sloat) sleeping in their new home, unaware that an invisible demonic presence is also watching them and waiting to strike. </p><p>It makes you wonder what happens in your own home while you’re fast asleep. We are filled with dread every time the video camera time clock reaches 3AM, when the vengeful supernatural forces pull comforters, slam doors, or drag someone into a pitch-black hallway. The lo-fi aesthetic and practical special effects make the scares feel more personal and tangible, culminating in a cruel and devastating ending. </p></div><div><p>Nicole Kidman delivers yet another arresting performance as Grace, a buttoned-up, devout mother who will do anything to protect her pale, delicate children with a rare condition that makes exposure to the sunlight painful. This means that the inside of the stately Gothic estate on the English countryside is cloaked in shadow and lit by candlelight throughout the film, which only heightens the tension of the ghostly happenings such as a piano playing by itself or doorknobs randomly jiggling. </p><p>One of the most terrifying scenes is when Grace finds an elderly woman wearing her daughter’s communion dress and playing with puppets but speaking in her little voice. There’s an antiquated eeriness to <em>The Others</em> in the depictions of seances and nineteenth-century photographs of corpses, all building to a surprising twist ending that completely turns the haunted house genre on its head.</p></div><div><p>Tobe Hooper, who directed the grimy <em>Texas Chainsaw Massacre</em>, and producer Steven Spielberg, the king of suspenseful blockbusters, join forces for Poltergeist, which follows the Freeling family living in a suburban California home. The film is filled with bold and unforgettable visuals: a knotted tree that comes to life and bursts into a child’s bedroom, a creepy clown doll, a face melting into bone, a little girl sucked into a television set, and a pool filled with skeletons. </p><p>The family enlists a team of paranormal experts, including a psychic, to try to rescue Carol Anne (Heather O’Rourke) and exorcise the sinister and restless spirits that haunt their home. They eventually discover a macabre truth about the land their home was built on. While <em>Poltergeist </em>is certainly scary, it also has a playful side, offering a thrill ride that gleefully drags its characters through a chaotic, rollercoaster-like experience.</p></div><div><p><em>The Orphanage</em> blends a traditional haunted house ghost story with a missing persons thriller, set in a decaying estate that was once an orphanage. After living there as a child, Laura Rodríguez (<span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.google.com/search?sca_esv=1deeb23685599852&amp;rlz=1C1VDKB_enUS1096US1097&amp;sxsrf=ADLYWIL9cBdHiD0DdNNVZq1Pt-tN934XMA:1737143797822&amp;q=Bel%C3%A9n+Rueda&amp;stick=H4sIAAAAAAAAAONgFuLSz9U3MCorMk6vUuIEsS2yq5KytISyk6300zJzcsGEVXJicckiVh6n1JzDK_MUgkpTUxIB3Jb3aTwAAAA&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=2ahUKEwi5tfj3xP2KAxW2E1kFHRENFrkQ9OUBegQIEhAE&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.google.com/search?sca_esv=1deeb23685599852&amp;rlz=1C1VDKB_enUS1096US1097&amp;sxsrf=ADLYWIL9cBdHiD0DdNNVZq1Pt-tN934XMA:1737143797822&amp;q=Bel%C3%A9n+Rueda&amp;stick=H4sIAAAAAAAAAONgFuLSz9U3MCorMk6vUuIEsS2yq5KytISyk6300zJzcsGEVXJicckiVh6n1JzDK_MUgkpTUxIB3Jb3aTwAAAA&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=2ahUKEwi5tfj3xP2KAxW2E1kFHRENFrkQ9OUBegQIEhAE" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Belén Rueda</a></span>) returns to the orphanage with her husband Carlos (Fernando Cayo) and their seven-year-old son Simón (Roger Princep), planning to transform it into a haven for children with disabilities. </p><p>Soon, Simón claims to have befriended a boy named Tomás, who wears a disturbing sack with a painted-on smile. Laura also sees him appear throughout the grounds. Shot in muted colors, <em>The Orphanage</em> carries a deep sense of melancholy. After Simón mysteriously goes missing, the film moves toward a tragic and shocking ending that reveals the creepy children cliché is more than it seems. </p></div><div><p>James Wan is a master of horror because he knows exactly how to carefully and slowly form heart-jumping, inventive scares with haunting images. They often strike you when you least expect it, like the sudden appearance of a foot dangling from a ghastly pale body hanging from a tree, or a craggy, snarling witch perched on top of a dresser. <em>The Conjuring</em> is one of his best films, based on the true story of the Perron family, who move into a house where strange occurrences begin—waking up at 3:07AM every morning, bruises appearing on the mother Carolyn’s (Lili Taylor) body, and an unseen figure lurking in a pitch-black bedroom corner. </p><p>The way Wan reveals the ghosts—slow and steady, yet quick and lacerating—is truly terrifying. <em>The Conjuring</em> also turns the real-life demonologists Ed and Lorraine Warren, who also worked on the Amityville Horror case, into compelling protagonists with a romantic love story. It also gives them a connection to the film’s surprisingly moving themes of motherhood. </p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

However, developer Second Dinner has let it be known that it is doing all it can to get <em>Marvel Snap </em>back online, and they’re hoping that’s at some point this Martin Luther King Day.</p><p>Late Sunday night, the company put out a statement on X acknowledging the situation, and the intention to “have it back online within 24 hours.”</p><p>Exactly why <em>Marvel Snap</em> got taken down at the same time as the TikTok ban came into force is unclear, and it certainly wasn’t expected by Second Dinner. On January 19, when the game suddenly went dark in the U.S., <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://x.com/seconddinner/status/1880861537981944300&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://x.com/seconddinner/status/1880861537981944300" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">the developer posted</a></span>, “Unfortunately MARVEL SNAP is temporarily unavailable in U.S. app stores and is unavailable to play in the U.S. This outage is a surprise to us and wasn’t planned.”</p><p>At the same time, Second Dinner let affected players know it is aware that the downtime screws with a bunch of “time-based content, rewards, and missions,” but promised to all would be “compensated for their lost time.” </p><p>However, despite TikTok already being back online, <em>Marvel Snap </em>is still down Monday morning. Trump immediately declared his plan to intervene as soon as the ban was enacted (<span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://bsky.app/profile/briantylercohen.bsky.social/post/3lg4augymnk2c&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://bsky.app/profile/briantylercohen.bsky.social/post/3lg4augymnk2c" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">a ban which, of course, he himself announced in 2020</a></span>), which gave TikTok the confidence to come back online. However, it seems ByteDance’s <em>Marvel Snap</em> has gotten caught in the crossfire. TikTok boss Shou Zi Chew is attending Trumps inauguration, so perhaps someone could ask him to flick the switch back on for <em>Snap</em> while they’re there?</p><p><em>Marvel Snap</em> isn’t alone in being caught in all this. Other ByteDance apps like CapCut and Lark are also down, as the Chinese company presumably just yoinked everything at once to be safe from violating the ban. However, <em>Snap</em> is still available and working as normal in the rest of the world.</p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

You don’t get to win the Electoral College without making a few enemies, after all.</p><p>In Section 3 of the United States Constitution, which details a few critical duties of the President of the United States (POTUS), one passage reads: “He shall from time to time give to the Congress Information of the State of the Union.” What it doesn’t say is that, also from time to time, the president shall roll up their sleeves and open a can of whoop-ass. And we’ve seen people assume the role of president in movies and have to save the country by any means necessary.</p><p>As Donald Trump returns to office as the 47th President, it’s a good time to look at some cinematic chief executives to remember what responsibility, initiative, and cunning look like. From disaster epics to alien invasions, here are 13 of the most badass presidents in action movies.</p></div></div><div><p>Making the low end of this list is President Charlotte Field, played by the alluring Charlize Theron in the 2019 rom-com <em>Long Shot</em>. The low placement is purely a technicality: She doesn’t actually become president until the <em>end </em>of the movie.  But, president-elect Field deserves greater recognition, as only Theron could pull off a tense hostage negotiation while utterly zonked out on ecstasy. Remember: Never negotiate with terrorists, only with homies.</p></div><div><p>Before <em>Inception</em>, there was <em>Dreamscape</em>. Dennis Quaid leads this overlooked sci-fi movie from 1984 as a psychic and con artist who joins a study that allows him to enter people’s dreams. Halfway through the movie, Eddie Albert appears as a POTUS haunted by recurring nightmares—an Achilles’ heel the villains exploit to attempt his assassination. Oscar nominee Albert is more or less sleepwalking through his part, though in the climax, he stands up to a gnarly stop-motion snake monster until a knocked-out Quaid gets back on his feet.</p></div><div><p>Snake Plissken is tasked with saving President John Harker in John Carpenter’s dystopic sci-fi (and all-time great) movie <em>Escape from New York</em>. But the slimy Harker gets a moment to shine as he saves Snake’s ass by shooting up The Duke (Isaac Hayes) and taunting him in the process. Plissken is no fan of Harker, and by the end of the movie, it’s unlikely audiences would vote for him either. However, getting the final kill without upstaging Kurt Russell is kind of cool.</p></div><div><p>Danny Glover’s President Wilson isn’t a badass because he rushes before the enemy, guns blazing and dodging bullets. In Roland Emmerich’s disaster flick <em>2012</em>, which toys with the hoopla around the Mayan calendar, President Wilson is a badass because of how he commands a dignified aura as he soothes a hysterical nation bombarded by Mother Nature’s wrath. Not one to hide in a comfy bunker, Wilson provides additional comfort to everyone around him in the immediate vicinity of the White House—or at least, he tries to. You can imagine how hard it is to get things done when cataclysmic earthquakes tear up the North Lawn.</p></div><div><p>Jonathan Pryce returns as the unnamed Commander-in-Chief from 2009's <em>G.I. Joe: The Rise of Cobra</em> for the Jon M. Chu-directed sequel <em>Retaliation</em> (2013). Though Pryce has much more to do in <em>Retaliation</em>—with not one but two standout scenes, telling off world leaders at a G8 Summit in one and disavowing the G.I. Joes in another—he’s actually not the president at all. He’s Zartan in disguise, continuing a plot thread left at the end of <em>Rise of Cobra</em>. But as far as the world of <em>G.I. Joe</em> is concerned, their president has suddenly turned into a stone-cold badass.</p></div><div><p>On paper, having Sam Jackson playing the role should instantly make his president, William Alan Moore, the most badass movie president of all time. But Jalmari Helander’s cartoonish buddy adventure <em>Big Game</em>—in which Air Force One is shot down over the wilds of Finland—has Jackson step aside to let Onni Tommila, a 13-year-old deer hunter, soak up most of the movie’s crowning moments. But President Moore isn’t made of glass, and he survives a steep fall into a ravine inside an ice cooler and wins a knife fight with a terrorist. He may not be a bad motherfucker, but he’s no lame duck either.</p></div><div><p>On one hand, President Tom Beck of <em>Deep Impact</em> fulfills his job description to a T: he leads America with solemnity and grace. But it’s an entirely different matter to lead the nation through an extinction-level catastrophe. While Morgan Freeman is a distinguished president, his first meeting with an ambitious MSNBC journalist (Téa Leoni)—who suspects the big secret around “Ellie” is some garden-variety extramarital affair—paints Beck more like a mafia boss than a democratically elected leader of the free world. If you think Freeman can only play stately gentlemen and wise elders, his introduction in <em>Deep Impact</em> will make you see him in a new light.</p></div><div><p>The ...<em>Has Fallen</em> movies are all about Gerard Butler’s Secret Service agent Mike Banning breathlessly racing to protect the President of the United States or going on the run after being framed for trying to assassinate the president. In the first two films, Butler puts himself in front of many, many bullets for President Benjamin Asher, played by Aaron Eckhart—a vanilla but not flavorless action-movie POTUS. Asher isn’t afraid of picking up a gun or headbutting a dude. But, like all good presidents, he delegates those duties to a capable agent.</p></div><div><p>“I want the people to know they still have two out of three branches of the government working for them. And that ain’t bad.” Jack Nicholson weaponizes his smarmy charm as President James Dale in Tim Burton’s ludicrous <em>Mars Attacks!</em> Though the Martians are ostensibly the villains, Burton’s film revels in the rotten core of humankind—a doomed species even without help from alien invaders. Look beyond Dale’s impassioned speech about brotherhood across boundaries to spot hints of self-serving motives; even the Martians know better than to trust a politician. Still, credit to President Dale for getting them to listen in the first place.</p></div><div><p>You’ve got to give it up to <em>Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter</em>. That title is upfront and unambiguous: it’s about Abraham Lincoln, who hunts vampires. (And frankly, he does it pretty well.) Both Seth Grahame-Smith’s original novel and Timur Bekmambetov’s film version are tongue-in-cheek farces that maintain a straight-faced facade, but star Benjamin Walker puts in an honest effort to give Honest Abe some action-hero swagger. Abe isn’t as cool as Blade or Buffy, but he’s got more chops as a vampire hunter than Hansel and Gretel do as witch hunters.</p></div><div><p>Jamie Foxx’s President Sawyer, from Roland Emmerich’s witty action-thriller <em>White House Down</em>, is an unsubtle Barack Obama analog, down to a minor—but circa 2013, timely—subplot involving the withdrawal of troops in the Middle East. But Obama never wore Jordans, not during his time in office, anyway. Nor did the 44th president aim a rocket launcher at the front gate of the White House. That’s all Sawyer, an eloquent statesman who takes questions from an 11-year-old YouTuber like she’s Anderson Cooper. While a sweaty Channing Tatum takes charge in most of the action in <em>White House Down</em>, Foxx isn’t afraid to get his presidential hands dirty.</p></div><div><p>President Thomas J. Whitmore, played by Bill Pullman in Roland Emmerich’s smash hit <em>Independence Day</em>, taught us all how to celebrate. Whitmore is such a badass that getting into the cockpit of a McDonnell Douglas F/A-18 Hornet to fight aliens isn’t even the most memorable thing he does in the movie. After noticing that the eerily young pilots about to fight an invasive species are “a little nervous,” Whitmore grabs a loudspeaker to bid his brave soldiers a good morning—and then some. “Mankind—that word should have new meaning for all of us today,” he says. Go ahead. Finish it. You know the rest.</p></div><div><p>A thousand action movies revolve around protecting the President of the United States. So it’s a hell of a thing how Wolfgang Petersen’s <em>Air Force One</em> follows a hero’s journey in which the POTUS who has to save himself. Who else but Harrison Ford could play the ready-to-rumble Head of State? After <em>Air Force One</em> is sabotaged by neo-Soviet terrorists, President Ford—sorry, President Marshall—gets down and dirty at over 35,000 feet, knocking out goons and shooting up others before ordering Gary Oldman to “get off my plane.” Hail to the Chief, baby.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
