              <p>Bose’s <em>QuietComfort</em> line leads the way for the company in active noise cancellation, and Amazon just dropped the price to an unprecedented record low that makes premium audio accessible to anyone. The <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4702/">QuietComfort headphones now sell for $169, slashed from the usual $349 (51% off)</a> and provide active noise cancellation and high-fidelity sound for less than half the price of the original.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4702/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Noise Cancellation That Works</h2>
<p>Active noise cancellation technology suppresses ambient sound incredibly well and creates that quiet bubble when traveling by airplane, train, or working in a noisy office. It suppresses background chitchat, the rumbling of engines and air conditioning humming immediately when Quiet Mode is on so you can just tune in to your music or work without diversion. The system works both through <strong>active electronic cancellation and passive isolation</strong> provided by the plush ear cushions and stops sound within a very wide range of frequencies.</p>
<p>Aware Mode works the opposite way and pipes the ambient sound into your ears with external microphones and enables you to hear your surroundings without removing the headphones. This is useful if you want to hear airport announcements or have quick conversations, or be more attentive to the traffic while walking. Quiet and Aware modes toggle instantly with a button press for seamless control over how much of the outside world you want to let in.</p>



<p>Plush ear cushions softly <strong>encompass your ears in their over-ear design</strong>, rather than pressing hard against them. With even pressure distribution from the memory foam padding, hot spots and discomfort do not develop during extended wear like they can with poorly designed headphones. The padded headband keeps everything secure without pulling tight across the top of your head.</p>
<p>The<strong> 24-hour battery life easily covers multiple days of typical use</strong> without the need for frequent charging. You can take these on weekend trips without packing the charging cable, and commuters easily get through a full work week on a single charge. Then, USB-C fast charging gives you 2.5 hours of playback from just 15 minutes plugged in-perfect for when you forgot to charge overnight and you’ve got to leave soon.</p>



<p><strong>High-fidelity audio reproduction reproduces clear and detailed sound</strong> in all frequency spectra. Bass hits with impact and depth, yet does not overpower the mid or muddy the vocals. Treble stays crisp and present but never gets harsh and fatiguing even on longer listening sessions. The Adjustable EQ in the Bose app lets you customize the sound signature to match your preferences: boost the bass for hip-hop or elevate the treble to make classical music shine.</p>
<p>Multipoint Bluetooth connectivity lets you p<strong>air with two devices at the same time</strong> while switching between them automatically, depending on which one is playing audio. You can watch videos from your laptop and jump right into your phone calls without having to manually disconnect and reconnect. The feature does away with the frustration of juggling multiple devices all day long. Bluetooth range of up to typical home and office distances is covered without dropouts or issues in connectivity.</p>
<p>At $169, you’re paying less than half the original price for flagship Bose noise cancellation, 24-hour battery life, and premium comfort that competing headphones at this sale price can’t match. This record low price on Amazon brings legendary audio quality within reach and you shouldn’t miss that opportunity.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Premium brands like Sonos and Bose created the TV soundbar market because modern TVs keep getting thinner and leave no room for decent speakers that produce quality sound. Amazon spotted this trend and developed its own <strong>Fire TV soundbar</strong> that has become a runaway hit, stealing market share from established competitors. For early Black Friday, Amazon has <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4711/">dropped the price to $84 from the usual $119 which marks a record low that makes this soundbar’s value proposition unbeatable</a>.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4711/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Sound Quality That Transforms Your TV</h2>
<p>A dual-speaker setup brings in<strong> full and rich audio that clarifies TV dialogue</strong> and delivers it more clearly than any thin TV speaker could do. Voices of film and television actors stand out distinctly instead of getting muddled by the background music or sound effects. The improved bass response helps add depth to explosive effects, music, and other low-frequency sounds that a flat-screen TV speaker can barely reproduce.</p>
<p>DTS Virtual X technology<strong> crafts a three-dimensional soundstage</strong>, and virtually envelops users in surround sound from just the two front-facing speakers. Audio seems to emanate from all different directions around the room, rather than coming from a single point below your TV. This spatial processing creates a far more immersive way of enjoying movies, as sounds of every type-source are positioned where they would naturally occur in a scene. <strong>Dolby Audio processing</strong> enhances the overall sound with added detail and clarity and reveals subtle audio elements in music and films that basic television speakers will often mask or eliminate completely.</p>



<p>The system sets up in literally seconds, thanks to the single HDMI cable connection. You hook up the included HDMI cable to your television’s HDMI eArc or ARC jack, and it just works: the soundbar comes to life with audio already synchronized to video. There is no complicated configuration, no multiple cables to manage, and no digging around through TV menus to enable audio output.</p>
<p>The <strong>compact 24-inch length and 2.5-inch height fit under most TVs</strong> without blocking the screen or IR sensors. The slender profile easily slides onto TV stands and entertainment centers without needing furniture rearrangement or special mounting hardware. The soundbar will remain unobtrusive while dramatically improving your audio experience, keeping a clean look that doesn’t dominate your living room setup.</p>



<p>Bluetooth connectivity makes the soundbar a <strong>wireless speaker for streaming music from your phone</strong> or tablet. You can fill the room with Spotify, Apple Music, or podcasts without ever having to turn on your TV. The audio quality works for casual listening and background music during gatherings or when working around the house. The Bluetooth range is good enough to cover typical room sizes without dropouts, issues in connectivity and pairing is fast via common standard Bluetooth settings on your devices.</p>
<p><strong>Fire TV integration</strong> means easy operation with Fire TV devices or Fire TV Edition televisions. Your same old Fire TV remote now controls both the volume of the TV and the soundbar without any programming or setup. You adjust audio levels using the same remote you use for just about everything else, never having to juggle multiple remotes or reach for the soundbar itself. It recognizes commands instantly without lag, and changing volume feels utterly natural and immediate.</p>
<p>But the <strong>soundbar works with any smart TV or streaming device</strong>, not just Fire TV products. In fact, your Roku, Apple TV, Chromecast, or cable box can all get enhanced audio through the HDMI connection. Gaming consoles such as PlayStation and Xbox route their audio through the soundbar for better gaming sound with clearer directional cues and more impactful effects.</p>
<p>For $84, you’re getting a fraction of what Sonos or Bose would charge for similar features while getting audio processing technology that matches-if not surpasses-what the premium brands offer.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/portable-gaming-15-inch-display-is-going-for-mere-pennies-amazon-already-sold-10k-units-at-this-record-low-2000644965</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/portable-gaming-15-inch-display-is-going-for-mere-pennies-amazon-already-sold-10k-units-at-this-record-low.1356400/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Portable monitors solve the problem of working or gaming on tiny laptop screens when you’re away from your desk setup. They’re especially useful for Nintendo Switch players who want a larger display without lugging around a full TV and they give remote workers genuine dual-screen productivity anywhere.</p>
<p>The <em>MNN</em> 15.6-inch portable monitor <strong>delivers Full HD resolution and plug-and-play convenience in an ultra-slim package</strong> that fits easily into backpacks. Amazon <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3959/">has dropped the price to $58 from the usual $89, hitting a record low that explains why over 10,000 units have already sold at this price</a>. The combination of great IPS display quality and multi-device compatibility at budget pricing makes this<strong> one of the best portable monitor deals available</strong>.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3959/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Display Quality That Delivers</h2>
<p>The<strong> 15.6-inch IPS panel runs at 1920 x 1080 resolution</strong>, and shows sharp text and detailed images that match the native display quality of your laptop. Colors seem accurate and vivid thanks to the IPS technology, which keeps image quality consistent across the full 178-degree viewing angle. You can view the screen from the side without seeing color shifts or contrast degradation that plague cheaper TN panels.</p>
<p>The HDR enhances compatible content with higher contrast and color depth to give gaming and video more life-like realism. Bright scenes exhibit more detail in highlights without blowing out to pure white; dark areas retain shadow detail instead of crushing to black. The blue light reduction features minimize eye strain during extended viewing sessions, allowing you to work or game for hours without the fatigue that comes from staring at unfiltered screens.</p>



<p>With<strong> the dual USB-C ports</strong>, plug-and-play connectivity requires just one cable for both power and the video signal. You hook up a single USB-C cable between your laptop or phone and the monitor, and it’s displaying your content without installing any driver or complicated setup. This single-cable solution reduces clutter caused by separate power adaptors and video cables. The monitor is compatible with devices supporting Thunderbolt 3.0 or USB 3.1 Type-C with DisplayPort Alternate Mode, which covers most modern laptops, tablets, and phones. <strong>The HDMI port adds compatibility with older devices</strong>, game consoles and computers without USB-C outputs.</p>
<p>The monitor connects to Nintendo Switch consoles a d gives you a larger 15.6-inch screen for portable gaming that still fits in a bag. The display transforms Switch gameplay from the cramped 6.2-inch handheld screen to a much more comfortable viewing size. It also <strong>works perfectly with PlayStation 5, PlayStation 4, and Xbox via its HDMI connection</strong>, and lets you game on a secondary screen in dorm rooms, hotel rooms, or anywhere you can’t access a full TV. <strong>Compatibility with PC and Mac</strong> via USB-C makes it useful for extending your laptop workspace with a second monitor that travels easily.</p>



<p>The<strong> smart cover protects the screen during transport</strong> while doubling as an adjustable stand when opened. The durable PU leather exterior resists scratches and impacts that would damage an unprotected screen bouncing around in a backpack. You can fold the cover into multiple angles, letting you prop the monitor at different viewing positions for comfortable use whether you are sitting at a desk or lounging on a couch. The <strong>slim 0.3-inch profile and lightweight 1.7-pound construction</strong> make the monitor genuinely portable rather than just technically movable, like heavier alternatives.</p>
<p>At $58, you’re paying less than half its original price for a real Full HD IPS portable monitor with HDR support and various connectivity options. This record low brings dual-screen productivity and large-screen portable gaming within reach of tight budgets.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/samsung-kicked-off-black-friday-early-now-quietly-offloading-its-galaxy-tab-s11-at-a-new-low-2000644979</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/samsung-kicked-off-black-friday-early-now-quietly-offloading-its-galaxy-tab-s11-at-a-new-low.1356379/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Samsung clearly labeled this as an <em>“early Black Friday deal”</em> on Amazon which typically means this is the best price you’ll see all year on their latest flagship tablet. The Galaxy Tab S11 represents Samsung’s most advanced tablet and directly competes with iPad Pro models which makes it the premier Android alternative if you prefer not to be locked into iPadOS.</p>
<p>Amazon has <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5649/">dropped the price of the 256GB WiFi mode to $709 from the usual $859, which armsk a record low</a> for a tablet that launched recently. The combination of MediaTek’s 3nm processor, Dynamic AMOLED 2X display, included S Pen, and Galaxy AI integration creates a compelling package that challenges Apple’s dominance in the premium tablet space.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5649/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Impressive Design and Performance</h2>
<p>It boasts an <strong>11-inch Dynamic AMOLED 2X display for great visuals</strong> including very deep blacks and vibrant colors with outstanding contrast to make elements pop. The technology used in this display is far superior in color accuracy and brightness compared to a regular LCD panel which makes this ideal for creative tasks and consuming media. The peak brightness levels ensure that it remains readable outside and in brightly lit areas where budget tablets would be completely washed out. The<strong> screen supports HDR content</strong> from streaming services, improving movies and shows by adding better dynamic range.</p>
<p>The<strong> impossibly thin 5.5mm profile</strong> makes this one of the slimmest tablets out there, sliding smoothly into backpacks and bags without adding bulk. Despite the very minimal thickness, the tablet feels solid and well-constructed rather than fragile or flexible. The lightweight design prevents arm fatigue during extended holding sessions-be it reading, sketching, or just watching videos.</p>



<p>The 3<strong>nm MediaTek processor is an example of leading chip technology</strong> that supplies flagship performance while maintaining excellent power efficiency. Packing more transistors into less space thanks to the advanced manufacturing process, the newer chip designs assure faster processing and better battery life compared to older chip designs. It will keep multitasking smooth when running multiple apps at the same time-switching between productivity tools, streaming apps, and creative software lag-free.</p>



<p>The<strong> IP68 rating</strong> for water and dust resistance protects the tablet against splashes, rain, and dusty environments. You can use this tablet at the pool, on the beach, or outdoors without constantly worrying that the elements will destroy it. The rating certifies submersion in up to 1.5 meters of fresh water for 30 minutes, providing genuine protection beyond just splash resistance.</p>
<p>The<strong> included S Pen stylus has a new hexagonal and cone-shaped design</strong> which creates a more natural writing experience resembling an actual pen. The shape prevents the stylus from rolling off tables, and the sides ensure a better grip during extended note-taking or drawing sessions. Pressure sensitivity responds to how hard you press, creating thicker or thinner lines just like traditional drawing tools.</p>



<p>Gemini Live integration supplies information on demand through screen sharing or camera access. You can aim the camera at objects, documents, or products to obtain information immediately and get context-aware help. The <strong>AI assistant answers questions, provides translations, identifies items, and gives relevant suggestions</strong> based on what you’re looking at.</p>
<p>The 1<strong>8-hour battery life covers full days of mixed use</strong> including streaming, productivity work, web browsing, and creative projects. You can work through long flights, spend entire days out without chargers, or binge multiple seasons of shows on a single charge. This includes an efficient processor and optimized software that work together to maximize battery longevity without sacrificing performance.</p>
<p>At $709, you’re getting Samsung’s latest flagship tablet technology with AI features, premium AMOLED display, IP68 durability and included S Pen for $150 less than the regular price. This early Black Friday deal brings iPad Pro competitor specs and features to a price point where Apple doesn’t compete.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/bose-revolve-bluetooth-speaker-drops-to-peanuts-amazon-pushes-last-stock-at-40-off-to-liquidate-fast-2000644856</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/bose-revolve-bluetooth-speaker-drops-to-peanuts-amazon-pushes-last-stock-at-40-off-to-liquidate-fast.1356367/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Bose represents the premium tier of consumer audio gear and their Bluetooth speakers rank among the best available. The <strong>Soundlink Revolve+</strong> delivers the kind of sound quality and build that justifies the brand’s reputation, with <strong>360-degree audio projection and real bass response</strong> that cheap speakers can’t replicate.</p>
<p>Amazon <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5646/">has dropped the price to $179 from the usual $299 for an early Black Friday deal</a> which marks an all-time low for this model. With all of the competition flooding the market, no other speaker on sale right now can match this combination of performance and value at this price point (not even the budget-focused alternatives that typically cost half as much).</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5646/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Sound That Fills the Room</h2>
<p>Instead of emanating from a single front-facing speaker, t<strong>he 360-degree sound design radiates audio uniformly in all directions</strong>. You get even volume and clarity, whether you’re standing straight in front of the speaker or sideways to it in another part of the room. This omnidirectional approach works great for outdoor gatherings, poolside parties or when people are dispersed around the speaker rather than seated in front of it.</p>
<p>The bass performance is surprising, considering how people generally perceive portable speakers to sound thin. Its <strong>dual passive radiators</strong> aid the main driver in providing low-end punch that you can literally feel when the track has heavy bass. In electronic music, hip-hop, and rock songs, this energy does not go away; rather, it doesn’t sound tinny or hollow. It can handle very high volumes without distortion and pushes out clean sound loud enough for outdoor spaces without breaking up or rattling.</p>



<p><strong>One charge lasts up to 17 hours</strong> so you can cover full days of continuous playback without having to hunt for an outlet. That runtime is good for taking the speaker camping for a weekend, using it at all-day events or just keeping it going throughout super-long work sessions. You won’t have to worry about it dying mid-song. There’s an optional charging dock that’s sold separately to keep the speaker topped off at home, if you like, but the included cable works fine as it is.</p>
<p>The <strong>IP55-standard water and dust resistance protects against splashes, rain, and sandy environments</strong> without a need for a protective case. You can confidently use this speaker by the pool without panicking if someone has splashed water on it, and it survives an unexpected rain shower while using it out of doors. The rubberized exterior shrugs off bumps and drops that would shatter speakers with glossy plastic shells. It features an integrated handle and makes carrying between rooms or grabbing when heading outside both easy while its shape stays stable on uneven surfaces.</p>



<p>The on-board microphone handles speakerphone calls with clear audio that picks up your voice without echoing or muffling. <strong>Conference calls sound natural</strong> and the person on the other end hears you properly even if you’re standing several feet away from the speaker. Voice assistant integration includes Siri and Google Assistant, letting you control music, check the weather, set timers, or manage smart home devices with voice commands.</p>
<p>The Bose Connect app opens up options for settings and updates and allows the user to tailor the behavior of the speaker and invoke party mode to connect several Bose speakers together. <strong>You can adjust EQ settings</strong> if you’d like more or less bass, manage Bluetooth connections, and view battery status from your phone. Firmware updates keep the speaker current with new features and improvements.</p>
<p>At $179, you’re getting flagship audio quality at mid-range speaker pricing. The combination of 360-degree sound, substantial bass, 17-hour battery life, and weather resistance creates a package that budget speakers simply can’t match even at their regular prices.</p>

              <p><span>Schools love to crush kids’ spirits when they’re all collectively hyperfixating on something, so it’s almost surprising that it took four months of pop culture dominance for an educational institution to try and ban </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/kpop-demon-hunters-best-worst-songs-soundtrack-ranking-2000616633"><i><span>KPop Demon Hunters</span></i></a> <span>from its hallways. Is it because the kids are too busy </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/kpop-demon-hunters-tonight-show-golden-performance-ejae-2000633180"><span>singing about the power of friendship</span></a><span> to do their classwork? Nope! It’s because some folks at the school are apparently uncomfortable with children referencing something with demons in it.</span></p> <p><a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/ceq03r3z2eqo"><span>The BBC</span></a> <span>reports that the Christian Lilliput Church of England Infant School in Poole, Dorset, sent an email to families on Friday, November 14, saying that some of the church’s Christian employees and students are “deeply uncomfortable” with the film’s references to demons, which include the songs the titular girl group performs. The email asked parents to tell their kids “not to sing these songs at school out of respect for those who find the themes at odds with their faith.”</span></p>

 <p><span>In an update today, November 17, head teacher Lloyd Allington said that some parents had responded arguing that </span><i><span>KPop Demon Hunters’</span></i><span> music had a positive impact on their children, with its songs prioritizing “teamwork, courage, and kindness.” Still, the school’s leadership seems unmoved in its decision.</span></p>

 <p><span>“While we fully respect your right to make choices about the content your child engages with at home, we also want to be mindful of the diversity of beliefs within our school community,” Allington said in the email. “For some Christians, references to demons can feel deeply uncomfortable because they associate them with spiritual forces opposed to God and goodness.</span></p>

 <p><span>“We are not asking parents to tell their children that there is anything wrong with enjoying the film or its songs if it aligns with your own views and beliefs…Our role will simply be to help children understand that some of their peers may hold different views and to explore how we can respect and support those peers in upholding their faith.”</span></p> <p><span>When I was in elementary school, my teachers tried to put a blanket ban on </span><i><span>Pokémon</span></i><span>.</span> <span>It didn’t stick. These kinds of rulings never do because by the time that schools decide these cultural phenomena are a problem, they’re too ingrained in how kids connect with one another to just forcefully remove them from school grounds. Kids will find a way to talk about and enjoy the things they love, no matter how many times you try to smother them. Lock in for 2029, school teachers. Huntr/x will be back with new songs when </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/kpop-demon-hunters-2-sequel-netflix-release-date-2029-2000641414"><i><span>KPop Demon Hunters 2</span></i></a><span> comes to Netflix.</span></p>

              <p><span>The PlayStation 5 is officially five years old. In the half a decade since the console was released, Sony has become a pretty different company in terms of the games it puts out, prioritizing prestige narratives and live-service forever games, and it hasn’t quite worked out for the company. Despite this, the PS5 still has a lot of spectacular games, and with the fifth anniversary here, we figured it was time to update our list of the best games you can buy on the PlayStation Store right now.</span></p> <p><span>This time, we decided to make some sweeping changes to the list. The last time we updated our best PS5 games roundup, it had several holdovers from the original 2020 launch. So when we looked at it this week, we figured it was time to drop a lot of those early games. That’s not to say those games aren’t great, but a lot of real bangers have come out in the past year, and we’re finally out of the cross-gen era in which games landing on PS5 were often still coming out on the PS4 as well. So now we have a pretty comprehensive list of games that are actually PS5 games, rather than up-rezzed PS4 ones. You’ll still see a few bangers from early on in the PS5’s life on this list, though.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>Without further ado, here are our picks for the best games you can pick up on PS5.</span></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>During a recent appearance at a video game convention, <a href="https://kotaku.com/life-is-unfair-a-q-a-with-nier-automatas-director-1795653562"><em>NieR: Automata</em> creator Yoko Taro</a> addressed complaints and jokes from some fans online saying that the enigmatic creator hasn’t put out any big new games in years. According to Taro, it’s not from lack of trying, but instead due to frequent cancellations.</p> <p><a href="https://automaton-media.com/en/news/nier-automata-creator-yoko-taro-says-hes-actually-been-working-on-a-lot-of-projects-recently-its-just-that-they-got-cancelled-midway/">As reported by <em>Automaton Media</em></a> and <a href="https://www.4gamer.net/games/991/G999110/20251114049/"><em>4Gamer</em></a>, over the weekend in Korea, <a href="https://kotaku.com/yoko-taro-mask-nier-automata-emil-lost-anime-expo-2023-1850603039">Yoko Taro (who always wears a mask in public)</a> and <em>Bayonetta </em>director Hideki Kamiya took part in a panel discussion at G-CON 2025. The two game makers talked about game development, design, and their creative processes.&nbsp; At one point, the two game developers were asked to share some information on their latest game projects, and while Kamiya mentioned work was going well on the previously announced <em>Okami</em> sequel, Taro didn’t have much to share because his projects kept getting canceled.</p>

 <p>“I often get told stuff like ‘Why aren’t you making a new sequel to <a href="https://kotaku.com/nier-automata-the-kotaku-review-1793002839"><em>NieR</em></a>?’ or ‘Yoko Taro isn’t doing anything,’ but that’s because recently, a lot of projects I was involved in got discontinued midway through development,” said Taro.</p>

 <p>“I’ve actually been working on some stuff, it’s just that it never ended up seeing the light of day. I got paid for it, so I personally have no issues with that, but people seem to think that I haven’t been doing anything just because none of the work I’ve done is being released.”</p>

 <p>Taro wasn’t too sad about all the canned projects, though, explaining that he is staying optimistic and telling the convention-goers that he’d rather fail many times if it leads to making something good rather than releasing a bunch of not-so-great games.</p> <p>“I don’t view [the cancellations] as a negative thing,” explained Taro. “I believe that if I’m going to release something weird, I’d be better off not releasing anything at all.”</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><span>I know there’s no point in getting heated about </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/game-awards-2025-goty-nominees-categories-clair-obscur-2000644825"><span>the Game Awards</span></a><span> every year, but the 2025 nominations are really making this year’s event feel like it’s gonna be the </span><a href="https://theonion.com/taco-bells-five-ingredients-combined-in-totally-new-way-1819564909/"><span>Taco Bell of award ceremonies</span></a><span>. By that, I mean it feels like every category’s nominations are made up of the same five or so games. </span><i><span>Clair Obscur </span></i><span>and </span><i><span>Ghost of Yotei </span></i><span>were eating, but pretty much anything else got snubbed. But I’m not here to yell about games, actually. I’m here to call attention to one of the most egregious snubs of the show, which is found in a non-game category. Specifically, where the hell is </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/sonic-hedgehog-3-review-shadow-keanu-reeves-jim-carrey-1851726797"><i><span>Sonic the Hedgehog 3</span></i></a><span> in the Best Adaptation category?</span></p> <p><span>Best Adaptation was added to the Game Awards’ categories in 2022, rewarding TV and film adaptations of video games for finally getting off of the Uwe Boll assembly line and sometimes being things worth watching. Now that pretty much every company from Nintendo to Sony is trying to get into streaming services and multiplexes, it’s a worthwhile category to have at a video game award show. However, the 2025 Adaptation category is so vile in its inclusions and omissions that it’s enough to make a hedgehog vow to destroy the world for his dearly departed best friend.</span></p>

 <figure id="attachment_2000007812" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000007812"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000007812">© Paramount</figcaption></figure> <p><span>This year’s nominees range from forgettable to absolute dogshit. Here’s what we’re working with:</span><i></i></p> <ul> <li aria-level="1"><a href="https://kotaku.com/minecraft-movie-review-bad-jack-black-kids-movie-steve-1851775345"><i><span>A Minecraft Movie</span></i></a></li> </ul> <ul> <li aria-level="1"><a href="https://kotaku.com/devil-may-cry-netflix-review-season-1-dante-lady-vergil-1851774417"><i><span>Devil May Cry</span></i></a></li> </ul> <ul> <li aria-level="1"><a href="https://kotaku.com/splinter-cell-deathwatch-anime-netflix-2000619516"><i><span>Splinter Cell Deathwatch</span></i></a></li> </ul> <ul> <li aria-level="1"><a href="https://kotaku.com/last-of-us-season-2-hbo-max-show-review-joel-ellie-abby-1851774661"><i><span>The Last of Us</span></i><span>, Season Two</span></a></li> </ul> <ul> <li aria-level="1"><a href="https://kotaku.com/until-dawn-movie-trailer-rami-malek-wendingo-dr-hill-1851739047"><i><span>Until Dawn</span></i></a></li> </ul> <p><span>First of all, don’t even get me started on </span><i><span>The Last of Us </span></i><span>season two; you can read </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/last-of-us-season-2-episode-7-finale-recap-abby-jesse-1851782357"><span>literally thousands of words</span></a><span> I wrote on it earlier in the year. Meanwhile, </span><i><span>Sonic the Hedgehog 3</span></i><span>, the movie that currently holds the </span><a href="https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/sonic_the_hedgehog_3"><span>highest Rotten Tomatoes score of any video game adaptation</span></a><span>, is nowhere to be seen. There are a few reasons this probably happened. The cinematic adaptation of </span><i><span>Sonic Adventure 2 </span></i><span>came out last December, just late enough to miss the 2024 awards but still be eligible for the 2025 ceremony. That’s long enough for the jury to have forgotten that the movie could compete for the prize, and for stinkers like </span><i><span>Minecraft </span></i><span>and </span><i><span>The Last of Us </span></i><span>to be top of mind. This is an especially heinous oversight given the </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/knuckles-review-paramount-plus-episodes-season-one-1851423404"><span>Very Bad </span><i><span>Knuckles </span></i><span>Paramount+ show</span></a><span>, which sidelined the actual </span><i><span>Sonic </span></i><span>characters for the most obnoxious of its human originals, was nominated in 2024.</span></p> <p><span>Part of getting past the whole “putting stock in award shows” phase of your life is recognizing that they are often merely reflections of what the jury actually got around to. That’s likely why 2025’s nominees, rather than representing the breadth of the medium, wound up being so many of the same games over and over again. Some of the categories, such as Accessibility and Esports, are voted on by a jury of experts, while a lot of the rest are more generalized, which often keeps the more niche games, like </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/hundred-line-last-defense-academy-steam-switch-reviews-1851781786"><span>the IMO obvious GOTY contender </span><i><span>The Hundred Line: Last Defense Academy</span></i></a><span>,</span> <span>from getting the nods they deserve. And sometimes you just get weird oversights, like </span><i><span>Sonic the Hedgehog 3</span></i><span> missing out on a nomination for Best Adaptation, while Jack Black saying “Chicken jockey!” gets to cosplay as a good film for a night. God, </span><i><span>The Last of Us </span></i><span>season two is going to win, isn’t it? I gotta lie down. Keanu Reeves didn’t deserve this.</span></p>

            <title><![CDATA[Escape From Tarkov Is Finally On Steam And Nobody’s Happy]]></title>
            <link>https://kotaku.com/escape-from-tarkov-steam-1-0-unheard-edition-2000644941</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/escape-from-tarkov-is-finally-on-steam-and-nobody%E2%80%99s-happy.1356244/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><i>Escape from Tarkov</i>’s efforts to move on from its early access period and become a full release have not gone smoothly. Steam users lament a variety of concerns with the new 1.0 release, from gripes over the pricing of different versions to complaints that just launching the game is a laborious and frustrating process.</p> <p>On November 15, hardcore extraction shooter <i>Escape from Tarkov</i> saw two notable events occur. Firstly, it emerged from a beta status, which it was in for over eight years, into the full, official 1.0 release. And secondly, it arrived on Steam. Unfortunately, as the game’s director <a href="https://www.pcgamesn.com/escape-from-tarkov/steam-launch-user-reviews">Nikita Buyanov seems to have anticipated</a>, user reviews on the platform have met the game with scorn, dragging the overall rating into “Mixed” status for its English reviews.</p>

 <p>“[It’s] one of the most premium pieces of launcher software I have ever purchased,” <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198157204571/recommended/3932890/">reads one</a> of the top “Most Helpful” negative reviews on Steam. “Great hardcore experience, it already starts with trying to launch the game – 10/10” reads <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198035754009/recommended/3932890/">a cleverly disguised “positive” review</a> in the same category. That critique doesn’t seem to be an overreaction either, as several other reviews cite an <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/id/snoygg/recommended/3932890/">hours-long struggle</a> just to get into the game.</p>

 <p>These launch issues follow recent turmoil within the game’s community over the fact that the Steam version would <a href="https://kotaku.com/escape-from-tarkov-1-0-arena-steam-epic-unheard-edition-2000626063">require a separate purchase</a> for those who already owned the game. And <i>that </i>controversy came fresh after developer Battlestate Games faced tough criticism over <a href="https://kotaku.com/escape-from-tarkov-refund-voucher-1851490315">a controversial $250 version of the game</a>. Like your average game of <i>EFT</i>, it’s messy.</p> <p><i>Tarkov</i>’s tough-as-nails gameplay will probably always appeal to a select and discriminating group of shooter aficionados. Still, this poor reception arrives with some unfortunate timing as the extraction shooter genre has seemingly never been more popular; <i>Arc Raiders</i>’ persistent status in the <a href="https://steamdb.info/charts/">top three most-played games</a> on Steam and the wide appeal of <a href="https://kotaku.com/theres-a-damned-good-reason-escape-from-duckov-has-sold-a-million-copies-in-a-week-2000638588"><i>Escape from Duckov</i></a> speak to a rise in popularity, one in which genre pioneer <i>EFT</i> feels notably left out of the conversation.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[New Survey Says Most Players Around The World Prefer Single-Player Games]]></title>
            <link>https://kotaku.com/new-survey-most-players-around-world-prefer-singleplayer-games-solo-2000644895</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/new-survey-says-most-players-around-the-world-prefer-single-player-games.1356211/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Data from a new global survey involving over 30,000 gamers spread across 20+ markets shows that, overall, people who play games prefer single-player over multiplayer. However, digging into the data reveals some interesting differences between countries like Germany and China, as well as how age plays a factor.</p> <p>On November 17, Ampere Analysis published the results of a large-scale video game survey focusing on <a href="https://kotaku.com/look-single-player-people-are-just-better-5826946">single-player vs. multiplayer games</a>. The research and marketing firm asked 34,428 people who have played a video game in the last year if they agreed with this statement: “I prefer single-player games over multiplayer games.” And the newly released data shows that gamers in most countries do.</p>

 <figure id="attachment_2000644930" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000644930"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000644930">©Ampere Analysis</figcaption></figure> <p>In the United States, Ampere’s data revealed that 65 percent of gamers prefer single-player, making it the country with the highest number of solo-leaning players. Right behind the United States is Japan at 63 percent, Thailand at 62 percent, and Germany at 60 percent. Meanwhile, a slightly lower number of United Kingdom gamers, 58 percent, prefer single-player over online gaming.</p>

 <p>Interestingly, China and Sweden are the two countries that don’t prefer single-player, according to this survey. 47 percent of players in China and 49 percent in Sweden prefer single-player, meaning more than half would rather log on and play with friends or randos.</p>

 <h2>Multiplayer is more popular with younger gamers</h2> <p>Digging into the data more, Ampere says that gender didn’t play much of a factor, with 55 percent of men and women preferring single-player over multiplayer. On the other hand, age did play a major factor in the survey.</p> <p>According to the firm’s data, only 49 percent of 16-to 24-year-olds prefer playing by themselves. Preference for single-player adventures jumps up to 56 percent when you reach the 25-to-34-year-old range. Meanwhile, 64 percent of gamers aged 55 or older prefer single-player titles.</p>

 <p>This isn’t very shocking to hear, as free games like <a href="https://kotaku.com/old-games-2023-playtime-data-fortnite-roblox-minecraft-1851382474"><em>Roblox </em>and <em>Fortnite</em> have become extremely popular</a> with <a href="https://kotaku.com/pc-gaming-newzoo-balatro-helldivers-2-gdc-time-spent-1851771352">kids and teens who might not be able to afford playing $70+ single-player games</a>. They also likely have more free time to coordinate online sessions with pals, whereas anyone over the age of 30 will be able to share stories of how damn hard it is to get a few friends online to play anything.</p> <p>One thing to keep in mind: Just because this survey and <a href="https://kotaku.com/survey-data-study-53-percent-gamers-singleplayer-pvp-1851665722">others show that a lot of gamers want single-player games</a>, that doesn’t mean publishers are going to stop making live-service titles. The reality is that publishers want to nickel and dime people with one game rather than make a few very expensive single-player adventures that could flop and can’t support years of seasonal updates and battle passes.</p>
