              <p><span>Nearly a decade after it was first teased,&nbsp; </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/metroid-prime-4-reviews-is-it-good-switch-2-nintendo-2000649621"><i><span>Metroid Prime 4: Beyond</span></i></a><span> is finally out on Nintendo Switch and Switch 2. Samus Aran’s latest first-person sci-fi adventure is a visual treat that features some well-designed levels that provide hours of satisfying exploration and puzzle-solving. Unfortunately, annoying NPCs, a big ol’ boring desert, and a nothingburger villain make this a messy, so-so entry in the </span><i><span>Metroid </span></i><span>franchise.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><i><span>Metroid Prime 4 </span></i><span>starts with a large-scale galactic battle that wouldn’t be out of place in a </span><i><span>Halo </span></i><span>or </span><i><span>Star Wars</span></i><span> game. An army of Space Pirates, led by </span><i><span>Metroid </span></i><span>villain Sylux, is attacking a Galactic Federation facility, and Samus arrives to save the day. But shortly after showing up, Samus, Sylux, and some Federation troops are teleported to the faraway alien planet of Viewros, which is where </span><i><span>Prime 4</span></i><span> takes place. Here, Samus is isolated on a mysterious alien world and—</span></p>

 <blockquote><p><b>*Sci-fi-sounding notification beep* </b><i><span>Hey, good job reading the second paragraph of this review. If you are unsure of what to do next, you could try scrolling down to the next paragraph of text! This should help you move forward! You’re doing great!&nbsp;</span></i></p></blockquote> <p><span>Well, okay, Samus isn’t really isolated and alone on Viewros. Instead, a plucky squad of Galactic Federation troopers is located on the planet, too. Very early on, you encounter one of them, Myles, who is written as if he fell out of an MCU movie. The other troopers you meet are also different flavors of annoying, with each falling into one overused sci-fi soldier trope, from baby rookie to cool, silent sniper. There’s even a robot who is polite and comical! The whole gang’s here. And they all ruin the vibes constantly.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><span><a href="https://kotaku.com/metroid-prime-4-previews-trailer-ncps-companion-2000644368">None of these chuckleheads will shut the hell up</a>! When you discover each of them while exploring the game’s various levels and biomes, they end up working alongside you for an extended period of time and offer tips that seem to imply they think Samus is a buffoon. Stuff like “Scan that computer” or “Put a bomb there.” Yet all of them also treat Samus as if she’s Space Jesus and the coolest, most badass person ever.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><span>The worst of these offenders is Myles, who will call up Samus while she’s out exploring the open desert that connects </span><i><span>Pime 4’</span></i><span>s various levels and side areas and bug you to do this or that. A few times, I was out trying to find secrets and Myles intervened, marking a spot on my map for me to go to next. Thank god you’re here, Myles, or I might have enjoyed a few minutes of quiet exploration and discovery!&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><span>When the federation squadmates aren’t squawking, and it’s just Samus alone on a strange planet trying to solve puzzles and progress forward, </span><i><span>Prime 4</span></i><span> is a much better game.&nbsp;</span></p> <figure id="attachment_2000651408" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000651408"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000651408">©Nintendo / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p><span>The level design is exquisite, with each of the various biomes you explore and return to feeling both large and complicated without being confusing or a slog to work through. I’ve already talked about how much </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/metroid-prime-4-impressions-first-level-volt-forge-titanfall-2-factory-2000650657"><span>I love Volt Forge</span></a><span>, the first real level you visit in </span><i><span>Prime 4</span></i><span>, but the other areas are also fantastic. The legally mandated ice level, Ice Belt, is an often claustrophobic and creepy trek through an abandoned laboratory that was doing some strange alien tests. It ditches the ice caves and snow of most ice levels for sterile labs and windy alcoves that are all properly desolate and dreary.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><span>And of course, inside all of these levels are various alien enemies to fight, which isn’t a problem because combat in </span><i><span>Metroid Prime 4</span></i><span> is fantastic, even if it is more or less the same gunplay found in past </span><i><span>Prime </span></i><span>titles. You lock on, hop around and lob missiles, energy blasts, and elemental-themed shots at a varied selection of critters and robots. Certain enemies have different weaknesses, like ice blasts, which help you clear the hordes more effectively. It ain’t new, but it still feels good, and running at 120FPS, it looks incredible.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><span>That’s probably the biggest compliment I can pay to </span><i><span>Metroid Prime 4: Beyond.</span></i><span> This is a visually stunning, aesthetically cohesive first-person action shooter that runs like a dream. I never once encountered a FPS drop that was noticeable or ran into an area that looked ugly. Every inch of </span><i><span>Prime 4</span></i><span> delivers sharp, stylized sci-fi visuals that pop on a big 4K TV. This ain’t what I expect from a first-party Nintendo game, but I’m not complaining about it. I loved it so much, and it makes me hopeful for future Nintendo games on the Switch 2.&nbsp;</span></p> <blockquote><p><b>*Sci-fi-sounding notification beep*</b> <i><span>Hey, writer, don’t forget to mention the desert and the motorcycle! These are features in Metroid Prime 4, the game you played, and are worth including in your review. Use the keyboard to write about them in the next paragraph.&nbsp;</span></i></p></blockquote> <p><span>Right, the desert. This is the most baffling part of</span><i><span> Prime 4.</span></i><span> The large Sol Valley desert acts as a strange, mostly empty hub area connecting the different levels together. To help Samus traverse this large space, </span><i><span>Prime 4</span></i><span> gives the player a cool motorcycle. And it </span><i><span>is</span></i><span> cool, and feels great to drive. Hitting a dune while boosting and flying across the sands is sick shit. But the open desert just becomes a boring way to slow the game down.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>Find a new upgrade that will let you explore more of a past level? Cool. You get to drive all the way back to that level. Want to go get some upgrades now that you have a new Morph Ball ability? Well, guess what, you gotta drive through the desert again. Worse, to get into and out of the desert, Samus is forced through at least two different loading areas that make it feel barely connected to the rest of the game.&nbsp;</span></p> <div>           <ul>                           <li>                 <p>Back-of-the-box quote:</p>                 <p>“Hey, this is the back-of-the-box quote, Samus! You should read this.”   </p>               </li>                                         <li>                 <p>Developer</p>                 <p>Retro Studios  </p>               </li>                                         <li>                 <p>Type of game:</p>                 <p>First-person sci-fi adventure shooter  </p>               </li>                                         <li>                 <p>Liked:</p>                 <p>Stunning visuals, great level design, and solid performance  </p>               </li>                               </ul><ul>                                         <li>                 <p>Disliked:</p>                 <p>Annoying squadmates, the boring desert, Sylux, and the ending  </p>               </li>                                         <li>                 <p>Platforms:</p>                 <p>Switch, Switch 2 (played)   </p>               </li>                                         <li>                 <p>Played:</p>                 <p>Completed the main story and around 30% of the side content in 11 hours  </p>               </li>                                         <li>                 <p>Release Date</p>                 <p>December 4, 2025</p>               </li>                                     </ul>         </div>  <p><span>The desert also seems to imply </span><i><span>Prime 4 </span></i><span>is an open-ended adventure, but it ain’t. Like past </span><i><span>Metroid </span></i><span>games, you collect power-ups and unlock more of the game world in a mostly pre-determined order. And that would be more than fine if the desert didn’t seem to set up this idea that you had more freedom than you really do. It’s just a big empty waste of space that shouldn’t have been included in P</span><i><span>rime 4 </span></i><span>at all.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><span>And while exploring the desert, Myles will keep yelling at you to do this or check on that or open your map to go here, and it just becomes so tedious and annoying. Worse, to reach the game’s ending, you have to collect a ton of green crystals that spawn in the desert. I didn’t have enough when I got to the final moments of </span><i><span>Prime 4,</span></i><span> so I had to spend 30 minutes or so driving around the desert collecting gems while Myles repeated the same tip about harvesting the damn things. The word torture popped into my head a few times during all of this.&nbsp;</span></p> <blockquote><p><b>*Sci-fi-souding notification beep* </b><i><span>Oh no! Don’t forget Sylux! This is a villain that has been a part of Metroid for years now, but gets a bigger role than ever in this latest sequel. You should discuss him and his appearance in Prime 4 in the next paragraph.&nbsp;</span></i></p></blockquote> <p><span>Dear god, leave me alone, Myles. But yes, Sylux is in this game. And that’s… about all I have to say about that. I’m not trying to avoid spoilers; I just have nothing else to add. His presence is so minimal that at first I thought he was just a fun cameo included at the start. But no, you technically </span><i><span>(sort of) </span></i><span>see him a few more times before the end.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><span>What are his motivations? Why does he do anything he does in this game, which is very little? Why should anyone who, like me, hasn’t played the games he appeared in previously care about any of this? The game only really answers one of these questions if you manage to get 100 percent and unlock the secret extra ending. For everyone else, kick rocks.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><i><span>Metroid Prime 4: Beyond </span></i><span>is a good game made worse by some really bad choices. It features annoying characters who ruin the isolated and haunting vibes that this latest sequel strives so hard to create, and forces Samus to drive across a boring desert over and over and over again for no good reason other than forcing you to do some extra busy work to extend</span><i><span> Prime 4’</span></i><span>s runtime to around 11 hours for most people.</span></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><span>The Streamer Awards, an annual ceremony celebrating the best in live-streaming hosted and produced by QTCinderella, took place over the weekend in Los Angeles, California.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>There were some genuinely touching moments, like adorable grandma and jigsaw puzzle aficionado <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/ijustlovepuzzles">ijustlovepuzzles</a> winning the Hidden Gem award, and a touching speech from Best Breakout Streamer <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/adapt">FaZe Adapt</a>, but <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuCvMC6vemM">The Streamer Awards</a> was mostly three and a half hours of people regularly rewarded for behaving badly doing just that.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>If you aren’t privy to the interpersonal drama and controversy surrounding the professional streamer space, that’s okay. I wish I could </span><i><span>Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind</span></i><span> a lot of this information from my head. Just know that in the months leading up to the fifth annual Streamer Awards, host QTCinderella has broken down on her stream, citing stress around organizing the event, while other streamers (mostly ones not nominated for awards) accused her of rigging the ceremony. It was the special brand of drama-farming and rage-baiting that has come to define the streamer space.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><span>Just like earlier this year at San Diego’s TwitchCon, during which streamer Emiru (who won Best Creative Arts Streamer on Saturday) was </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/emiru-twitchcon-assault-video-cosplay-streamer-2000637226"><span>physically assaulted at a meet-and-greet</span></a><span> and “clip farmers” acted out on the convention floor and outside of it, bad behavior was on full display this Saturday at The Streamer Awards.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><span>Multiple clips circulated on social media over the weekend that are a cogent reminder of how young and, in many cases, small-minded some of the most popular streamers are. A 17-year-old streamer known as Rakai, who recently got a </span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/LivestreamFail/comments/1pcsvzd/twitch_partner_rakai_has_been_banned_for_2_years/"><span>two-year suspension for stealing flowers from Walmart while live</span></a><span>, approached a married, </span><a href="https://x.com/SlatDontMiss/status/1997473082601099651"><span>lesbian couple while live-streaming to ask them if they were gay</span></a><span>, not long after asking a different woman streamer if she “had a man.”</span></p>

 <p><span>Co-host FanFan, who mingled amongst attendees’ tables during the ceremony, </span><a href="https://x.com/scubaryan_/status/1997496510091550723?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1997496510091550723%7Ctwgr%5Ed2c8b429f5603e06934a254da23384087baad6ca%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fd-3543798751762506370.ampproject.net%2F2510081644000%2Fframe.html"><span>made a joke comparing Kai Cenat</span></a><span>, who is Black, to Sean “Diddy” Combs, “congratulating” him on his new documentary with 50 Cent. </span><i><span>Sean Combs: The Reckoning</span></i><span>, a four-part documentary examining the life and behavior of the rapper recently imprisoned for transportation of prostitution, just aired on Netflix. It was produced by 50 Cent. Immediately after her joke, an influencer named Tylil grabbed the mic FanFan was passing around to state, “If y’all gonna be making jokes, at least make it funny.”</span></p>

 <p><span>“The streamer awards: *fat joke* *gay joke* *anti black joke* *another gay joke* *another anti black joke*,” </span><a href="https://x.com/memebag_/status/1997705007899279646"><span>read a post on X</span></a><span>.</span></p> <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">India Love gets booed off stage after claiming DDG and Rakai deserved Breakout Streamer of the Year over FaZe Adapt 👀<a href="https://t.co/0IA0gN8As4">pic.twitter.com/0IA0gN8As4</a></p> <p>— FearBuck (@FearedBuck) <a href="https://twitter.com/FearedBuck/status/1997541200111219147?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 7, 2025</a></p></blockquote>    <p><span>At one point during the show, influencer India Love stormed the stage to insist that two other streamers, controversial rapper DDG and the aforementioned Rakai, deserved to win Breakout Streamer of the Year over FaZe Adapt. Love was booed off-stage and later apologized while livestreaming. “There was no excuse for my behavior,” </span><a href="https://x.com/FearedBuck/status/1997914755751718920"><span>she said</span></a><span>.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">My hottest take on the streamer awards is all the drama and clip farming is a direct consequence of promoting and rewarding that kind of behavior throughout the entire year. </p> <p>Reap what you sow type shit.</p> <p>— Sean (@SeanDaBlack) <a href="https://twitter.com/SeanDaBlack/status/1997682224557437387?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 7, 2025</a></p></blockquote>   <p><span>“My hottest take on the streamer awards is all the drama and clip farming is a direct consequence of promoting and rewarding that kind of behavior throughout the entire year,” wrote streamer SeanDaBlack on X. “Reap what you sow type shit.”</span></p>

 <p><span>Moments like </span><a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@twitch/video/7580961051093503246"><span>ijustlovepuzzles winning the Hidden Gem award</span></a><span> helped elevate The Streamer Awards’ vibes—the older woman streamer, who has 46,000 followers on Twitch, was incredibly emotional as she received her award. “I was in such a dark place when my kids created this Twitch account and gave me something to do. This stream gave me life,” she said.</span></p> <p><span>If streaming were more about platforming interesting people who genuinely love what they do and less about rewarding teen boys for misbehaving, maybe The Streamer Awards would be less tough to watch. Other winners included Flats for Best </span><i><span>Marvel Rivals</span></i><span> streamer, TheBurntPeanut for Best FPS Streamer and best VTuber, </span><i><span>Peak</span></i><span> for Stream Game of the Year, and </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/ishowspeed-crawley-tiktok-wizard-bark-off-twitch-clip-1851573475"><span>iShowSpeed</span></a><span> for Streamer of the Year.</span></p>

            <title><![CDATA[ASUS Offloads TUF Gaming Graphics Card Even Further After Black Friday as the GeForce RTX 5060 GPU Hits an All-Time Low]]></title>
            <link>https://kotaku.com/asus-offloads-tuf-gaming-graphics-card-even-further-after-black-friday-as-the-geforce-rtx-5060-gpu-hits-an-all-time-low-2000651222</link>
            <guid>1376242</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Graphic card upgrades can cost a pretty penny, but that’s not the case today. Right now, you can pick the ASUS TUF Gaming GeForce RTX 5060 Ti 8GB OC edition gaming graphics card without paying the full price, courtesy of a deal currently live on Amazon.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6279/">On a regular day, it would run you around $540, but you can snap it up at a 30% discount right now, which drops the price to $378.</a> This is its lowest it’s dropped to in quite some time, and is packed with everything you need to push some gaming and creative boundaries this holiday season. It’s selling out like crazy, though, which is why we recommend grabbing yours before it’s too late.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6279/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Improved Efficiency With Impressive Heat Dissipation</h2>
<p>ASUS has designed this thing with military-grade components for exceptional performance and reliability. We’re talking certified military-grade TUF chokes and MOSFETs to deliver impressive power to the GPU for better stability, plus 5K black metallic capacitors for wider temperature tolerance and a longer lifespan than other options in this range. The protective conformal coating makes the graphics card temperature (high and low), shock, humidity, and fog resistant, while the dual ball fan bearings ensure quiet cooling even when things get intense.</p>
<p>Speaking of intense gaming/creative sessions, you’ll also appreciate the axial-tech upgrades with fans that propel more air, and the high-quality diecast shroud with aluminum backplate featuring larger vents for even better heat dissipation. The MaxContact design expands the surface area of the heat spreader by 5% when needed to keep the overall GPU temperatures and prevent thermal throttling. Fans are also designed to stop when the temperature reaches below 50 degrees Celsius, letting you enjoy quieter performance during less resource-intensive tasks.</p>



<p>As for the performance, RTX is the most advanced platform for full ray tracing and neural rendering tech that completely upgrades the way you play. You’re getting fifth-gen tensor cores that deliver incredible AI performance with FP4 and DLSS4, new streaming multiprocessors that are optimized for neural shaders, and fourth-gen ray tracing cores for mega geometry. Translation? Low latency and improved visual quality for all your favorite titles. Responsiveness comes from Reflex 2, which offers quicker target acquisition and better reaction times, as well as introduces Frame Warp to further reduce latency based on the latest mouse input in the game. Customization options let you monitor performance and tweak settings based on your own preferences. This is done through GPU Tweak III, where you can overclock, undervolt, and monitor real-time stats with an intuitive interface.​ You’ll also enjoy access to MuseTree, which is an AI-powered image-generation app with your purchase, plus get a complimentary membership to Adobe Creative Cloud, all Apps.​</p>
<p>All in all, if you’ve been looking to upgrade the way you play your favorite titles or work on some creative projects, you need a solid graphics card in your setup. These don’t come in cheap, and discounts on some of the best options out there are few and far between, which makes this deal one worth grabbing. You’re saving $162 on an option that’s going to completely transform your experience, but the discount wraps up soon. Grab it before that happens!</p>

              <p>A holiday splurge is a good thing. A holiday splurge also does not mean paying full price for a bit of indulgence. That’s why we’re giving a hearty thumbs up to <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6278/">this Amazon deal that cuts 35% off the price of the truly jawdropping Samsung Odyssey Neo G9 curved gaming monito</a>r, a 57-inch giant with 4K UHD resolution and elite-level speed and refresh rate. The Odyssey Neo G9 is one of the absolute best gaming monitors available anywhere, and with this $800+ price plunge, it can and should be your 2025 holiday splurge at just $1,500.</p>
<p>Samsung’s established itself as the best monitor brand in the U.S., earning that title and best gaming monitor brand in the U.S. for two years running. The Odyssey Neo G9 is the best evidence of why — it’s truly huge, and the curved effect and flawless performance create one of the most immersive gaming experiences ever.</p>

<h2>The World’s First Dual UHD Monitor</h2>
<p>Talk about unique — the Samsung Odyssey Neo G9 is the first dual UHD monitor ever. The 57-inch display is as wide as two UHD monitors and brings every bit of the mindblowing detail and sharpness across the entire field of view. The action literally wraps around you as you play, giving you as deeply immersive an experience as you can get without using VR goggles.</p>
<p>The 240Hz refresh rate is a lock-solid lag killer, and the 1ms response time ensures that you are on top of your game, every time, with every move. This is the kind of speed that pro gamers use in competition, but at a far smaller price during this Amazon deal. The Odyssey Neo G9 also supports DisplayPort 2.1 for the latest and best connection.</p>
<p>AMD FreeSync Premium Pro technology is built into the monitor to create absolute sync between the Odyssey Neo G9 and the graphics processor of your console or PC, eliminating stutter, tearing, and other game-killing flaws.</p>



<h2>Outrageous Detail</h2>
<p>Samsung’s Quantum Matrix Technology with Quantum Mini LEDs creates some of the best brightness and contrast of any monitor anywhere. There are 2,392 separate dimming zones across the massive screen that combined with outstanding 12-bit black levels to create astoundingly accurate picture quality. The contrast ratio of 1 million to 1, spread over 57 inches of gaming space, will make you unbeatable.</p>
<p>The CoreSync and Core Lighting Plus won’t enhance your gaming, but they will greatly enhance your gaming space and save you the cost of buying gaming lights separately. The CoreSync tech projects your on-screen colors into the room behind you, with the gaming action and the lighting effects in perfect sync.</p>
<p>The Samsung Odyssey Neo G9 gaming monitor — 57 inches of brilliant 4K UHD resolution and blazing speed and refresh rate — is a truly elite device that’s just come way, way down from its elite price. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6278/">It’s $800 off at Amazon right now, but only for a limited time, so don’t miss out on your chance to splurge on yourself.</a></p>

              <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/stranger-things-season-5-ghosts-n-goblins-nes-arcade-error-2000649178"><i><span>Stranger Things</span></i><span>’ fifth and final season</span></a><span> is rolling out on </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/netflix-warner-bros-deal-batman-hbo-max-2000650875"><span>Netflix</span></a><span>, and it’s true, something certainly seems stranger than in previous seasons this time around. Viewers of the long-running supernatural coming-of-age drama are arguing that the show’s writing has taken a massive nosedive, and even as someone who isn’t actively watching the series, I feel like some of the clips popping up on my social media feeds are not flattering. Fans think a Netflix initiative might be to blame.</span></p> <p><span>Take, for example, these two clips of Noah Schnapp and Finn Wolfhard delivering extremely simple, flavorless dialogue with a seriousness and gravitas the language doesn’t earn. Some folks attribute the awkwardness of these scenes to the actors’ performances, but others point out that it’s not just the self-serious delivery that’s the problem; it’s that it’s mixed with dialogue so straightforward that it reads like a mandated plot summary for those who haven’t been paying attention.&nbsp;</span></p>

   <p><span>This dumbing down of dialogue is just one part of the issue; some are also criticizing the uptick in obnoxious quip-driven writing. Some fans are quick to point out that teenagers might believably say cheesy stuff like the kids do in </span><i><span>Stranger Things</span></i><span>, however, so that’s more of an ongoing debate. The pushback hasn’t stopped people from making parodies of the latest season, likening its banter to cringe TikTok speak or MCUisms.</span></p>

         <p><span>Fans have a theory that this decline in writing quality may have come from a Netflix mandate. In January, </span><a href="https://www.nplusonemag.com/issue-49/essays/casual-viewing/"><i><span>N+1</span></i></a> <span>ran a story that detailed initiatives within the streaming company which told creatives to essentially treat the service’s original programming as if viewers are going to be on their phones scrolling through social media as they watch it. This means dialogue is dumbed down, basic plot points are repeated unnaturally in spoken exchanges, and ideally someone can follow what’s going on, even if the show doesn’t have their undivided attention.</span></p> <p><span>It’s a real shame that </span><i><span>Stranger Things </span></i><span>might be falling into this trap in its final season, as fans have been waiting nearly a decade for this show to wrap up. Hopefully, the second set of episodes and the eventual finale will fare better when they’re released on Christmas and New Year’s Eve. Also, let’s hope that this doesn’t end up bleeding into all of the upcoming Warner Bros. projects if Netflix’s </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/netflix-wb-batman-arkham-hogwarts-legacy-mortal-kombat-2000650918"><span>merger goes through</span></a><span>.</span></p>
