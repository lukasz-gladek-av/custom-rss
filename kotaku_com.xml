              <p>Scott Pilgrim is taking on the world, again, in March. Capcom leans into Leon’s “hot uncle” makeover. And an old Kickstarter for a tabletop game reveals the worst outcome possible. It’s another edition of Morning Checkpoint, <em>Kotaku</em>‘s daily roundup of gaming news, rumors, and culture. Speaking of fan speculation and rumors, it’s never a good sign when the official franchise account <a href="https://x.com/assassinscreed/status/2016531108486095252">responds to you with a GIF from <em>Grand Theft Auto</em></a>. The <em>Assassin’s Creed IV: Black Flag</em> remake was reportedly delayed, but hopefully the <a href="https://x.com/yosp/status/2016446516236562657">next game from indie standout Red Candle Games</a> is coming along smoothly.</p> <h2><em>Scott Pilgrim EX</em> has a release date and a new trailer</h2>  <p>It’s out March 3 and will include League of Evil Exes’ Matthew Patel and Robot-01 as playable characters. This spiritual successor to the 2010 brawler is a bit more RPG-lite with non-linear quests and exploration, according to the devs at Tribute Games. They recently helped launch <em>Marvel Cosmic Invasion</em>, another excellent retro throwback with some neat tricks. Hopefully the team has put some cool surprises in <em>Scott Pilgrim EX</em> which, with today’s news, is now handily my most anticipated release of the winter.</p>

 <h2><em>Monster Hunter Wilds</em> fixes a bizarre DLC bug recently <a href="https://kotaku.com/monster-hunter-wilds-pc-performance-framerate-dlc-2000660149">unearthed by a modder</a></h2> <p><a href="https://info.monsterhunter.com/wilds/update/en-au/Ver.1.040.03.01.html">The new PC performance patch is out</a> and the notes include the following: “Fixed an issue where system load could increase around the Support Desk at Base Camp or the Grand Hub due to claimed content status checks.” Hopefully it brings the Steam version of the game more in line with the console version and turns things around in a meaningful way heading into the game’s one-year anniversary.</p> <h2><em>RuneScape</em> maker promises no genAI that players can “feel”</h2> <p>“We’ve got a pretty hard line stance with the team, which is a commitment that no generative AI will ever be present in any asset that a player can touch, hear or feel. There will be no generative AI in the game that they experience,” Jagex SVP of product James Dobrowski <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/runescape-maker-jagex-says-it-will-never-use-generative-ai-to-make-in-game-content">told <em>GamesIndustry.biz</em></a>. Tooling efficiency, which seemingly means coding, QA checks, and other process-oriented stuff, is another story.</p>

 <p>“Where we are open to the use of AI is in things like tooling efficiency; how do we make the way we work more efficient in order to make our staff’s lives easier and allow us to produce better content. But we do not want to be using AI to drive creativity,” he said.</p>

 <h2>Capcom talks about Leon’s “hot uncle” makeover</h2> <p>“We’ve spent quite a lot of time polishing Leon’s visuals,” <em>Resident Evil Requiem</em> director Koshi Nakanishi <a href="https://automaton-media.com/en/news/resident-evil-requiems-leon-kennedy-became-a-hot-uncle-thanks-to-hawk-eyed-female-capcom-staff-who-reviewed-even-the-finest-wrinkles-on-his-neck-director/">told <em>Automaton</em></a>. “Leon has many fans among Capcom employees, and women in particular were pretty strict when reviewing his design. They would point out and comment on even the finest details like the wrinkles on his neck. When I mentioned that story in the past, a female fan told me, The women developers at Capcom did a really good job&nbsp;(laughs).”</p> <h2><em>Arc Raiders</em> hit by DDoS attack ahead of next patch</h2> <p>Players who were recently having connection issues now know why. Community lead Julia Ossen told fans on the game’s Discord that the studio has been “under extensive, coordinated DDoS attacks” which the team is addressing. “The strike team has been working hard on mitigations and solutions to fix the problem, and we are making good progress,” she wrote. “But at this point in time the attacks are still ongoing.” The attack happened alongside the game’s new patch which <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ArcRaiders/comments/1qobyp9/here_we_go_slient_nerfs_not_mentioned_in_the/">includes some stealth nerfs</a>.</p>

 <h2>The<em> Darkest Dungeon</em> board game is dead</h2> <p>Over 28,000 backers&nbsp;pledged&nbsp;<span>$5,657,479</span> to help bring this project to life and no more shipments will be going out. “We put our trust in Mythic Games to deliver on their promises and uphold the <em>Darkest Dungeon</em> name,” Red Hook Games <a href="https://www.darkestdungeon.com/news/regarding-mythic-games-and-the-darkest-dungeon-board-game/">announced this week</a>. “We won’t mince words, their collapse and inability to fulfill Wave 2 orders is an enormously disappointing development and we know it deeply affects many <em>Darkest Dungeon</em> fans.” An ex-employee is providing the studio with the source files for all of Mythic’s work so players can make their own versions.</p> <h2>More indies are bailing on Xbox</h2> <p>Xbox versions of the stylish medieval combat game <em>1348 Ex Voto</em> and Nickelodeon’s<em> Splat Pack</em> have both been binned, <a href="https://www.tweaktown.com/news/109896/two-indie-games-have-cancelled-their-xbox-versions/index.html"><em>TweakTown</em> reports</a>. “While we previously announced that the game would be released on Xbox consoles, we have the unfortunate news that this is no longer the case,” the developer behind 1348 Ex Voto <a href="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/G_RrTmoWMAACEkw?format=jpg&amp;name=medium">said this week</a>. “As release approaches for the indie team, priorities are constantly evaluated and sometimes must shift to deliver the best experience possible.”</p> <h2>ICYMI:</h2> <ul> <li><strong><a href="https://kotaku.com/walmart-leak-gamecube-games-switch-online-metroid-pikmin-2000663430">More Switch Online GameCube games leaked</a></strong></li> <li><strong><a href="https://kotaku.com/mining-crystals-in-highguard-is-so-damn-satisfying-ps5-pc-steam-2000663527">Something <em>Highguard</em> gets right: mining crystals</a></strong></li> <li><strong><a href="https://kotaku.com/batman-arkham-parody-perfectly-captures-the-horror-and-absurdity-of-living-in-gotham-2000663597">Living inside <em>Batman: Arkham</em> would be terrifying</a></strong></li> </ul> <h2>Watch this:</h2>

              <p>Digital PC gaming storefront <a href="https://kotaku.com/gog-anti-drm-cd-projekt-witcher-3-cyberpunk-2000659280">Good Old Games</a> is the latest video game-related company to be caught using AI-generated artwork. As you might expect, a lot of people aren’t pleased about this, including an artist who works at GOG.</p> <p><a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2026/01/gog-now-using-ai-generated-images-on-their-store/">As first reported by <em>GamingOnLinux</em></a>, someone on <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/gog/comments/1qoigy5/ai_in_the_storefront/">Reddit spotted</a> what looks like AI-generated artwork being used to advertise an ongoing 2026 sale on GOG. The biggest giveaway that this art was generated using an AI tool or site is that a SNES-like console in the image seems to be melting. <a href="https://www.gog.com/forum/general/5000_gog_patrons_and_an_ai_banner/page1">GOG users actually spotted this AI artwork last week</a> and began posting about it. For many, it was disappointing to see a company that <a href="https://kotaku.com/gog-games-preservation-program-drm-1851696363">claims to care about preservation</a> and creators using AI to create a simple store banner.</p> <p>Likely in response to the hubbub surrounding the AI-generated banner, KosmicznaPluskwa, a GOG forums user who appears to be a graphic artist working at the company, <a href="https://www.gog.com/forum/general/5000_gog_patrons_and_an_ai_banner?staff=yes">posted a lengthy response on the store’s forums on January 26.</a> And while KosmicznaPluskwa made it clear they aren’t a spokesperson for GOG, the artist confirmed that the image people were speculating was machine-created was indeed generated completely using AI tools, something that upset the artist.</p>

 <p>“OK, so to clear the air – current sale banner is fully AI. Not my work,” posted KosmicznaPluskwa. “This is all I can say on this. My team is much smaller now than it used to be, and the requirements for the role are completely different than it used to be.”</p> <p><em>Kotaku</em> contacted GOG about the art, but didn’t hear back before publication.</p> <p>KosmicznaPluskwa continued in their lengthy forum post and discussed how AI art is everywhere now and how it makes them sad to see.</p>

 <p>“It’s just miserable to think about how surrounded and how ever-present it all is now,” said KosmicznaPluskwa.</p> <p>“How will it affect us as the humanity. And no, I don’t think it will destroy art altogether but the omnipresence of it will not not go without its effect on us as a whole. Maybe it doesn’t matter some store put out sloppy work on promo banner – in the end everyone is just there to buy the product – but I know I enjoy seeing cool new artworks out there, when I’m out to buy new products as well. When I buy a new cool figure I like to keep the box around if it’s pretty – this is kind of the same, but on digital level. More cool art to see on top of buying art (video games in our case here) is always more cool art in the world and this is what I’m happy to have. So with everyone also feeling strongly in this thread – I’m with you. And continue speaking up – in the face of future we don’t like to see, complacency is not the way.”</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><span>A long-rumoured PlayStation 5 upgrade for Warhorse Studios’ 2018 game </span><i><span>Kingdom Come: Deliverance</span></i><span> has seemingly been confirmed by mistake, as the PlayStation Store description listing now includes details for a “The PS5 version” version.</span></p> <p><span>Although this leak was </span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GamingLeaksAndRumours/comments/1qpgd10/kingdom_come_deliverance_ps5_information/"><span>initially spotted</span></a><span> on the PlayStation Store Italia page for the title, the same PS5-specific information has since appeared on the </span><a href="https://store.playstation.com/en-gb/concept/227410"><span>British PlayStation Store listing</span></a><span> for </span><i><span>Kingdom Come: Deliverance</span></i><span>.</span></p> <p><span>It now states that the game will be “Updated for PlayStation 5” and that the “PS5 version of Kingdom Come: Deliverance now features graphical updates including 4K resolution, improved framerate, high-resolution textures and many more. Medieval Bohemia has never been so beautiful.”</span></p>

 <p><span>The background of the key art on the PlayStation Store has also changed, removing the militia seen in the original artwork and replacing the scene with a darker orange background. The opening paragraph has also been updated: “(Re)discover Henry’s saga, from the start!”</span></p> <p><span>Neither the PlayStation Store Italia nor the British pages for </span><i><span>Kingdom Come: Deliverance</span></i><span> have been updated to specify a new release date, and still display the game’s original 13 February 2018 PlayStation 4 release date.</span></p>

 <p><span>However, the “2017 Warhorse Studios” trademark information, which is still present on the US PlayStation Store Page, has since disappeared from both the Italian and British store pages.</span></p> <p><span>No word from any of the </span><i><span>Kingdom Come: Deliverance </span></i><span>social accounts or any sort of announcement from publisher Deep Silver on its legitimacy yet, but rumours of a PlayStation 5 version of the game can be traced all the way back to </span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GamingLeaksAndRumours/comments/1mdsewq/kingdom_come_deliverance_1_may_be_getting_a/"><span>July 2025</span></a><span>.</span></p>

 <p><span>Those rumours have only ever mentioned a PS5 version of the game, and as of yet, none of the Xbox store pages for </span><i><span>Kingdom Come: Deliverance</span></i><span> have been updated with similar information.</span></p>

              <p><span>Streaming PS3 games through <a href="https://kotaku.com/sony-ps-plus-essential-extra-premium-microsoft-xbox-gam-1848722178">PlayStation Plus Premium</a>, Sony’s most expensive subscription tier, has seemingly been busted for at least two weeks now. It’s especially bad timing with <a href="https://kotaku.com/fallout-season-2-finally-fixing-dumb-midnight-release-time-2000663241"><em>Fallout</em> season 2</a> inspiring some PS5 owners to try to revisit the PS3 version of </span><i><span>Fallout: New Vegas</span></i><span>.</span></p> <p><span>Exactly two weeks ago today, one fan on the PS Plus subreddit posted a </span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/PlayStationPlus/comments/1qct49v/got_a_problem_with_streaming_on_ps5/"><span>thread titled</span></a><span> “Got a problem with Streaming on PS5.”As they explained, they were unable to boot up 2012’s </span><i><span>Epic Mickey 2: The Power of Two</span></i><span> through PlayStation Plus Premium’s cloud gaming service.</span></p>

 <p><span>After some attempts at troubleshooting, other players in the same thread quickly discovered they were facing the same problem. Every single PS3 cloud streaming game, for seemingly every subscriber, was suddenly refusing to load. No error message, no attempt to boot, nothing. <em>Kotaku</em> just&nbsp;tried to boot up Fallout: New Vegas and other PS3 games from the PS Plus and library menus on PS5 and had the same problem.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>From this point on, dozens more threads detailing the same issue began to crop up on the subreddit. In fact, the issue has become such a problem that, as spotted by </span><a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/news/2026/01/ps3-game-streaming-still-broken-and-sony-draws-criticism"><i><span>Push Square</span></i></a><span>, moderators have started deleting threads discussing the matter and guiding users towards a single megathread.</span></p>

 <p><span>Players have discovered a few </span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/PlayStationPlus/comments/1qfg98u/workaround_for_streaming_ps3_games_on_ps5/"><span>workarounds</span></a><span> for the issue, such as booting a Cloud Streaming title from their libraries instead of the store, but the fix doesn’t seem to work for everyone, and appears to be temporary for others. As of today, the </span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/PlayStationPlus/comments/1qol9xu/comment/o228w5a/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button"><span>top comment</span></a><span> on the moderator-created PS+ Criticism Thread claims the issue still hasn’t been fixed. “Insane this had been broken for nearly 2 weeks and no comms or fix,” reads one reply.</span></p>

 <p><span>Some fans </span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/PlayStationPlus/comments/1qj3zs5/contacted_support_about_the_streaming_and_this_is/"><span>have opted</span></a><span> to pester PlayStation Support for answers. One member of the support team reportedly confirmed that Sony is aware of the problem, stating that the “issue only impacts PS3 titles within the Classic Catalog.” But there’s still no explanation of what’s causing the problem and when it might be fixed. Sony didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment. </span></p>
