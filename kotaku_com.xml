            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Everyone deserves a pair of headphones that are comfortable to wear and sound great that doesn’t cost a ton of cash. Well you can have it all with the Sony WH-CH520 wireless Bluetooth on-ear headphones. They come in a wide array of fun colors and are dirt cheap, right now at least. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4594/">Normally going for $70, it’s down more than 46% to just $38. You’ll save a whole $32.</a></p>
<p>I’ve really got to applaud Sony on the brand’s naming scheme choices. You take a look at Apple and its flagship over-hear headphones are given a flashy name like the AirPods Max. Samsung’s line of earbuds are predictably the Galaxy Bus. But Sony? Nah. These are The WH-CH520. No sauce, just the meat — but it’s good meat.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4594/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<p>Pick between six stylish colors. The Sony WH-CH520 come in your classic black and white, but also in fun varieties like blue, yellow, pink, and cappuccino.</p>
<p>The headphones are super lightweight and the synthetic materials around the earcups are soft. You can comfortably wear them all day without taking them off. The band includes a plush head cushion. Some real bad pairs of headphones will create that awkward pressure right at the top of your head where it makes contact. That’s not a problem here.</p>



<h2>All-Day Listening</h2>
<p>And you really can wear them all day long with the super long battery life. One chare will last your an impressive 50 hours. Charging is fast too. If you find you’ve forgotten to plug them in before a big trip and you’re rushing out the door, no sweat. A miniscule three minute charge will bring them back up to a whole 90 minutes of listening time. You can plug them in while brushing your teeth and then be good to go.</p>
<p>Take hands-free calls when wearing the Sony WH-CH520 headphones. Your phone can stay in your pocket the next time it buzzes as you accept the call. Built-in microphones are able to isolate your voice from any distracting background noise so this way folks on the other end hear you and only you.</p>
<p>Multi-point Bluetooth allows you to connect the headphones to two different devices simultaneously. Pair them with both your phone and laptop. This way you can be listening to Spotify off the computer while you’re working or maybe be watching a YouTube video with lunch, then when someone calls you one your phone, you can seamlessly switch over and have the call come through the headphones. You can even play a podcast or music off your phone while also paired with your gaming console to make the grind more enjoyable.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4594/">For a limited time, grab these Sony WH-CH520 Bluetooth Headphones for the reduced price of $38.</a></p>

<h2>Recreate Marvel’s Most Iconic Moments</h2>
<p>Lego recreated that one slow-mo shot used in all the trailers. It’s the one in the opening scene from the movie as the Avengers are storming Hydra’s snow base and they all momentarily are all leaping through the air while busting through trucks and trees and whatnot. The first Avengers film had that tracking shot in the middle of Manhattan, circling around the heroes. Avengers: Age of Ultron had this.</p>
<p>The 613-piece Lego sets features favorite Avengers minifigures including the Hulk, Thor, Captain America, Iron Man, Black Widow, and Jeremy Renner. I mean Hawkeye. Designed for kids 10-years-old and up, this Lego Marvel set has some interactive elements. Simulate the Hulk’s explosive power and strength with the bunker that launches into the air. A push-along road vehicle is included. The set includes a variety of transparent stands so each of the Avengers can be suspended in air in the middle of the action, making it all feel dramatic and dynamic.</p>



<p>The whole set is reconfigurable to your liking. You can built it to spec, making the frame of the 2015 film to a T or, I don’t know, stick Iron Man and Captain America in the humvee to act out Tony teaching Cap how to drive before his road test. Buy a Batman minifigure and pretend he is in the Avengers, teaching Cap how to drive before his road test. That’s the magic of Lego.</p>
<p>The Lego Marvel The Avengers Assemble: Age of Ultron makes a great gift for a Marvel fan of any age. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4595/">Get it now while it’s on sale for $30 off, bringing the price down to just $70 for a limited time.</a></p>

            <title><![CDATA[After a Second Price Drop in Three Days, the 2025 ROG Strix G15 Has Just Reached a New Record Low]]></title>
            <link>https://kotaku.com/after-a-second-price-drop-in-three-days-the-2025-rog-strix-g15-has-just-reached-a-new-record-low-2000632593</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/after-a-second-price-drop-in-three-days-the-2025-rog-strix-g15-has-just-reached-a-new-record-low.1318927/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Shopping for a gaming laptop means balancing several critical factors: <strong>you need a powerful GPU</strong> that can handle modern games at high settings, <strong>a fast processor</strong> that won’t bottleneck performance, <strong>enough RAM</strong> for smooth multitasking, and a <strong>display with a high refresh rate</strong> that keeps up with fast-paced action. The ASUS ROG Strix G16 checks every box with its Nvidia GeForce RTX 5060 GPU powered by the new Blackwell architecture, Intel Core i7-14650HX processor, 16GB of DDR5 RAM, and a 165Hz display. This 2025 model has already seen a price drop recently, but <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4592/">Amazon just pushed it to a new all-time low of $1,199, down from $1,499</a>. That’s also $300 off and cheaper than the 2024 model currently sells for.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4592/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<p>The RTX 5060 GPU is a major step ahead due to <strong>the Nvidia Blackwell architecture</strong>: It introduces DLSS 4 technology, which employs AI to create additional frames and accelerate performance without compromise to visual fidelity. Practically, you are free to play demanding games such as Cyberpunk 2077 or Alan Wake 2 at increased settings with smooth frame rates. The technologies for Max-Q aim for optimal power efficiency so the laptop produces muscular performance without overwhelming heat and fan noise. Ray tracing creates incredibly realistic lighting, reflections and shadows, and it enhances the visual experience for games supporting it.</p>
<h2>Processing Power and Memory Designed for Gaming</h2>
<p>The Intel Core i7-14650HX is a hybrid processor featuring 16 cores: <strong>8 performance cores for demanding tasks and 8 efficiency cores for background processes</strong>. This architecture means the laptop can handle gaming while simultaneously running Discord, streaming software, or browser tabs without stuttering. The base clock speeds reach up to 2.2 GHz, with <strong>boost frequencies climbing to 5.2 GHz</strong> when you need maximum power for intense gaming sessions or content creation work like video editing.</p>



<p>The <strong>16GB of DDR5-5.6GHz memory provides fast memory access</strong> to maintain smooth operation of everything. DDR5 is significantly faster than DDR4, reducing load times and delivering increased frame stability for memory-intensive games. The<strong> 1TB PCIe Gen 4 SSD provides ample storage</strong> for your game collection and serves up read speeds of up to 7,000 MB/s.</p>



<p>It uses a 16:10 aspect ratio instead of a typical 16:9, and gives it extra vertical screen estate useful for gaming and productivity work. The FHD+ resolution of 1920 x 1200 pixels is a sensible compromise between image sharpness and performance, as more demanding resolutions would involve extra stress on the GPU. Smooth motion during a bullet blaster or a racing game is <strong>provided by a refresh rate of 165Hz</strong> and motion blur and ghosting are eliminated by a 3ms response time.</p>
<p>The ROG <em>Intelligent Cooling</em> is where ASUS shows off its engineering expertise: <strong>End-to-end vapor chamber spreads heat across a larger surface</strong>&nbsp;and tri-fan technology exhausts more air through the case. Employing Conductonaut Extreme liquid metal on the chipset, rather than typical thermal paste, transfers heat more efficiently, retaining lower temperatures even during longer gaming sessions. Advanced cooling equates to a laptop operating at its highest potential, rather than thermal throttling.</p>
<p>At $1,199 for Prime members during its current Prime Big Deal Day sale, you are getting 2025’s current gaming technology at a sub-last-year’s-model cost.</p>

              <p>Tell me if this has ever happened to you. You and you’re friends are out having fun and you want to snap a quick group photo, or maybe something crazy is happening in front of you and you feel the need to record it. You pull out your phone, open the camera app, and then a little pop-up says your storage is full and that it can’t take any new photos. Then you frantically scrub through your camera roll looking for things okay to delete only for them to still not be enough somehow, and then the moment has passed.</p>
<p>Managing phone storage can be a nightmare, especially for those of us still carrying pics from over 10 years ago. There is a solution that is not upgrading to a larger capacity phone or paying a huge monthly fee for cloud storage. SanDisk has an SSD designed for use with phones which happens to be on sale for Amazon’s Prime Big Deals Day. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4590/">On October 7 and October 8, you can save $25 on the 1TB SSD (comes to $110) or $37 on the 2TB SSD (comes to $170).</a></p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4590/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Record on Your Phone to the Drive</h2>
<p>This SanDisk external SSD has been made specifically for use with your phone. It connects over USB-C meaning its compatible on any iPhone 15 and up and can then record photos and videos directly to the drive. The drive uses exFAT formatting which means it’s compatible with Windows, Android, and macOS devices right out of the box.</p>
<p>The Creator Phone SSD is even shaped to fit snuggly on the back of your Phone without being visible from the front. It uses MagSafe so it actually magnetically connects to the back of your phone, staying firmly in place while in use.</p>



<p>Along with recording new footage or photography onto the drive, you can also transfer stuff already on your camera roll to the drive or vice versa. Great for if you want spend an afternoon clearing out some of your old photos without getting rid of them to just make room new ones.</p>
<p>The drive really shines for for creators who frequently record video using their phone be it for work or otherwise. You can shoot in Apple ProRes 4K at 60 fps when paired with an iPhone 15 Pro/Pro Max or iPhone 16 Pro/Pro Max. Great for long shoots and then you already have the video files on a drive that can easily be transferred to your PC or Mac.</p>
