              <p>Mini PCs are a great alternative to tower desktops for anyone who wants to enjoy powerful performance while keeping their workstation clean and minimal. Acemagic makes some of our favorite options around, and Prime members can now grab one without paying the full price.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6588/">The Acemagic mini gaming PC (32GB RAM, 1TB SSD), is currently going for $599 at Amazon, after a nice 30% discount on its usual $856 price.</a> Even better, you’ll save an additional 5% at checkout, which drops the overall cost even more. The only catch? The offer is limited to Prime members. Non-Prime shoppers will see it at its regular price. That said, if you’re looking to pick up multiple tech items or home essentials for the new year, a Prime membership can be useful. It offers faster shipping, as well as access to member-only discounts that can help you save in the long run. Prime membership costs $15 per month, or $139 a year, but the retailer offers a free 30-day trial for you to try out the perks without committing.</p>

<h2>Incredible Performance</h2>
<p>This compact PC packs a solid punch. It runs on the 13th-generation Intel Core i9 13900HK processor that features 14 cores (6 P-cores + 8 E-cores) and 20 threads, plus boosts up to 5.4GHz. Built on the Intel 7 process technology with 24MB Smart Cache and 54W TDP, the processor delivers high speeds and reliable performance for all your tasks, whether you’re working on an office project or trying to push some creative boundaries. In fact, the processor even outshines i9 12900HK, 7840HS, and 6800H processors in terms of performance.</p>
<p>The PC comes with a massive 32GB (2×16GB) DDR4 RAM that makes it easy to multitask through busy days with ease. You will be able to work on a bunch of projects at the same time, use different applications simultaneously, hop between a ton of tabs, take back-to-back meetings, and more – all without slowing down one bit. Even better, the memory can be expanded up to 64GB as needed. Storage capacity is just as exceptional. You’re getting a built-in 1TB PCIe 4.0 NVMe SSD, which offers enough space to house all your important documents, research stuff, media content, etc, in a single place. Like memory, storage, too, is expandable up to 4TB. You can always add more as your needs grow, without relying on external solutions.</p>



<p>Port selection is wide. Connectivity options include WiFi 6E, Bluetooth 5.2, and a 2.5GbE LAN port. The USB4 port takes performance even further by offering up to 40Gbps transfer speeds. It’s capable of moving a 3GB 4K video in just one second – something creatives dealing with large projects are going to appreciate. Triple display output is also supported for those looking to create a bigger, more productive work setup. But despite this, the PC stays calm and cool while working. That’s thanks to its advanced dual fan cooling that ensures optimal performance even during resource-intensive tasks.</p>
<p>Best of all, Windows 11 Pro comes pre-installed, so you’ve got a system that’s ready to go right out of the box.</p>
<p>All in all, if you’ve been looking to upgrade your workstation without breaking the bank, now is the time to make the move. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6588/">This deal brings the price of an efficient, powerful mini PC down to just $599 for Prime members.</a> Snag it quick, as offers this good don’t last too long.</p>

              <p><span>The Pokémon Company seems likely t</span><span>o reveal the upcoming Generation X games in February on the series’ 30th anniversary, but if leakers have anything to say about it, Game Freak might not have much new information to give us by the time that showcase arrives. On December 24, a series of new leaks about the games, allegedly titled </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-leak-generation-10-wind-wave-galar-legends-mmo-2000635337"><i><span>Pokémon Wind </span></i><span>and </span><i><span>Wave</span></i></a><span>, began spreading online. We’ve gotten a few waves (sorry) of information since </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-wind-wave-pikachu-leak-generation-10-redesign-2000635674"><span>the massive Teraleak</span></a><span> in October, but now we know a little bit more about the games’ map, battle gimmick, and have even our first look at the new region’s professor.</span></p> <p><span>The latest info was posted on X early today by self-described <a href="https://x.com/i/status/2003786462651932797">Pokémon detective Moot Monthly</a>. All of these new images, animations, and illustrations are reportedly from this existing leak, so it’s entirely possible they aren’t indicative of the final games that will eventually ship on Switch 2. But they do give us some interesting insight into what Game Freak has been working on for the next mainline entries.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">Christmas came early, heres ur pokemon gen 10 leaks </p> <p>&gt;Gen 10 map<br>&gt;Majin Pikachu<br>&gt;professor<br>&gt;gameplay</p> <p>Join gaiachads discord for a q&amp;a when i wake up link in bio <a href="https://t.co/QmIuuTqgTi">pic.twitter.com/QmIuuTqgTi</a></p> <p>— Moot /ムート (@Mootmonthly) <a href="https://twitter.com/Mootmonthly/status/2003786462651932797?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 24, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <p><span>First, we have a new look at the beta versions of the male and female protagonists, and their previously reported Rotom scooter that they’ll ride around on. </span><i><span>Pokémon Legends: Z-A </span></i><span>really popped off with its fashion, so hopefully we’ll be able to customize our characters’ fits in </span><i><span>Wind </span></i><span>and </span><i><span>Wave</span></i><span>.</span></p>

 <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="zxx" dir="ltr"><a href="https://t.co/IcoKrFa5cx">pic.twitter.com/IcoKrFa5cx</a></p> <p>— (Not) Centro Leaks (@CentroLeaks_alt) <a href="https://twitter.com/CentroLeaks_alt/status/2003487471536153050?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 23, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <p><span>Next, we have some early renders of the games’ professor and the Pokémon Center. Apparently, the professor will ride around in a car and appear in multiple locations in the games’ archipelago setting. Right now, all we know is that he appears to be an older man with thick eyebrows and a beard.</span></p>

 <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="de" dir="ltr">Pokémon Gen 10 leak: the new Professor (he drives around in a car!) and how the new Pokémon Centers will look <a href="https://t.co/erGuj76bUM">https://t.co/erGuj76bUM</a></p> <p>— Centro LEAKS (@CentroLeaks) <a href="https://twitter.com/CentroLeaks/status/2003838143943094555?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 24, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <p><span>Speaking of the archipelago, we also have a new illustration of the Gen X region. Its beta map shows several islands that the player will be able to explore. Early reports say they will be procedurally generated, so it’s unclear if the map is a sort of presumed “default” shape for these islands or if the terrain is what changes for each player, rather than the shape of the landmass.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="ht" dir="ltr">Pokémon Gen 10 leak: here’s the beta map of the new region. <a href="https://t.co/ZNML8djcEu">https://t.co/ZNML8djcEu</a></p> <p>— Centro LEAKS (@CentroLeaks) <a href="https://twitter.com/CentroLeaks/status/2003837845975474261?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 24, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <p><span>The last and perhaps most interesting detail from the latest leak is a first-look at this gen’s battle gimmick codenamed “Majin.” This will reportedly be a factor in something called “weather moves,” but we still don’t know what those will entail. What we can see for now is that this phenomenon will seemingly distort a Pokémon’s physical shape and then create some kind of cloud to obscure them. Looking at what this shit does to Pikachu in the leaked animation, I’m not immediately onboard. But hey, it’s leaked in-development footage from a hack. We’ll see how it actually changes up battles when the games are eventually revealed.</span></p>

For now, </span><i><span>Pokémon Legends: Z-A</span></i><span>’s </span><i><span>Mega Dimension </span></i><span>DLC is keeping me busy, so I’m not starving for something new right now.</span></p>
