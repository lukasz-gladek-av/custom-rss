She also finds a quirky yet brilliant sidekick to sheepishly help her optimize her Ironheart suit, with an interesting twist. After meeting McGillicuddy (Alden Ehrenreich) and visiting his shady bunker full of black market weapons, Riri gets him to confess that his name is actually Ezekiel Stane. And he has a Ziploc bag full of the ashes of Obadiah Stane—his father!</p><p>Those who have been MCU fans since it began with the first <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/mcu-raza-return-wandavision-iron-man-vision-spin-off-tv-1851740404&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/mcu-raza-return-wandavision-iron-man-vision-spin-off-tv-1851740404"><em>Iron Man</em> movie</a></span> in 2008 will remember Obadiah (Jeff Bridges) as the ruthless Stark Industries executive who orchestrated Tony’s kidnapping in Afghanistan and horrifyingly pulled the arc reactor out of the Stark Industries founder’s chest. In the show, Ezekiel says he is 36 years old, which would make him roughly 17 when his father was killed by Iron Man. That’s still young enough for him to have developed the sort of trauma that’ll turn someone into the type to hoard weapons of mass destruction as a “hobby.”</p><p>Interestingly enough, Ezekiel tells Riri that he and his father weren’t close (hence the Ziploc bag urn) and references his father’s nefarious Iron Monger alter ego. However, in <em>Iron Man</em>, it’s never publicly revealed that Obadiah was the Iron Monger, which could suggest Ezekiel either had intimate knowledge of his father’s crimes from being involved, or that he was told about them later in life. Either way, <em>Ironheart </em>adds a cool expansion to the MCU history books—without making that the central appeal of an already great show. </p></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://kotaku.com/ironheart-iron-man-obidiah-stane-ezekiel-stane-disney-1851785091]]></content:encoded>

Worth 500z</li><li><strong>Krano Pyrite:</strong> Found by hunting high-rank Kranodath. Worth 1500z</li><li><strong>Gilded Scale:</strong> Reward for fishing a Goldenfry.

Worth 20000z</li></ul><p>Since their only purpose is to be sold, you’ll only see these items in the Sell Items menu that’s accessible through merchants or your camp. Trade-in Materials are categorized under the Special Items/Other tab. <strong>If you want to sell all your junk fast, press Triangle/Y to bring up the sub-menu, and then select <em>Sell All Trade-in Materials</em></strong>.</p><h2 id="h243038"><a id="2"></a>What else can be sold?</h2><p>It’s unlikely that you’ll run out of Zenny. Just completing hunts can provide more than you need. If they don’t, selling Trade-In Materials will yield a hell of a boost in funds. All that being said, you do have the choice to sell other things. Everything from ores and ingredients to weapons and armor can be traded for Zenny.</p><p>While there are certainly a lot of options, <strong>I would prioritize selling any low-rank armor you made and ingredients that you have a ridiculous amount of</strong>. Weapons can always be upgraded to higher rarities. Special items and materials you forage can be given to Item Traders for other rare assets. Even monster parts can be used to smelt ores if you don’t have any applicable weapons or armors to forge. Remember not to sell everything just because you can–plenty of stuff has other uses with the many mechanics of this game!</p><hr><p><br><em>Monster Hunter Wilds</em> is available now on PS5, Xbox Series X/S, and Windows PCs. </p></div></div><br/><br/>https://kotaku.com/monster-hunter-wilds-mh-zenny-trade-in-material-1851785064]]></content:encoded>

A riff on both cooking shows and late night talk show hosts, it’s a bit like foodie’s equivalent of<em> Reading Rainbow </em>presented in a stop-motion style with a Wes Anderson-like sensibility. It educates kids on the basics of how the food they put in their bodies is grown and prepared. Maybe they learn a greater appreciation for cooking. At the very least they aren’t rotting their brains on algorithmic YouTube garbage. </p><p>So like most people, including those who watch <em>Tiny Chef</em>, I stumbled upon its cancellation announcement completely by accident when a now-viral short of the titular character getting the bad news directly from the execs at Nickelodeon popped into one of my social feeds. “<span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2uQbr3f_-I&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2uQbr3f_-I" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Tiny Chef needs your help</a></span>,” reads the title of a YouTube video uploaded on June 24. In it, Tiny Chef is humming to himself and dusting his room when the news gets broken to him that the show is finished. “But I have ideas that will blow your mind,” he adorably lisps into the phone. <br></p><p>Instead of getting angry and blowing up he finally says, “I understand,” and tries to go back to cleaning before breaking down and sitting on his bed with his head in his hands. It’s crushing. “That little attempt to straighten himself out and then get back to what he was doing only to immediately break down...that’s REAL grief right there,” reads one of the top YouTube comments. “I didn’t know about this show until 10 minutes ago,” reads another. “But the depiction of the chef trying to be strong while this clearly gets to him is something I can relate to a lot and that clearly the creators understand very well.”</p><p>“<em>Tiny Chef</em> and the team need your help now more than ever!” reads a call for donations on the show’s website. “Many of you have said that you would die for <em>Tiny Chef</em>, we don’t need all that (!!!) but we do need crowd funding to keep going.” The creators have asked people to subscribe to the YouTube channel as well. It’s unclear at this point if the plan is to keep producing new episodes independently or try to demonstrate enough support so that one of the streaming services orders new episodes. </p><p>The show was created by animator Rachel Larsen, co-creators Adam Reid and Ozlem Akturk, and counts Kristen Bell of <em>Veronica Mars</em> fame as one of its producers and most frequent guest star. It’s the kind of kids’ programming that seems like a perfect fit for Disney or Apple. Brian Grazer and Ron Howard’s Imagine Entertainment took an equity stake in <em>Tiny Chef</em> back in 2019, so I’m sure it will find its feet. </p><p>.</p></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://kotaku.com/tiny-chef-nickelodeon-canceled-season-3-kristen-bell-1851785074]]></content:encoded>

Here, you’ll battle with 300 other players, fighting for spice and politics far above your station.</p><p>But worry not, the Deep Desert also features a PvE zone, should you rather avoid open combat with other players!</p><h2 id="h17315"><a id=""></a>How to play with friends in <em>Dune Awakening</em></h2><figure id="" data-id="ce6826bd566af634de914c46d9ad5416" data-recommend-id="image://ce6826bd566af634de914c46d9ad5416" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The guild screen in Dune Awakening." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="The guild screen in Dune Awakening." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Funcom / Brandon Morgan / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="ce6826bd566af634de914c46d9ad5416" data-recommend-id="image://ce6826bd566af634de914c46d9ad5416" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The guild screen in Dune Awakening." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Everything is better with friends, right? Sure, some of those things are better left unsaid, but we’re talking about playing <em>Dune Awakening</em> multiplayer, of course. You have options here, including joining a guild, partying up with others, and spending a bit of real-world money to host a private server with just you and your buddies.</p><p>To play with your pals:</p><ul data-type="List" data-style="Bullet"><li>Open your map, then select the social menu from the bottom of the HUD.</li><li>Check the players tab to see active players in the server, or search for your friend’s name manually, before sending out a friend request.</li><li>Select your prospect once they add you, then hit invite to party.</li></ul><p>Alternatively, your friend can invite you, which causes a pop-up to appear on your HUD. If you hit ‘Enter’ when it appears, you’ll join their group, so long as there’s room. Only four players can play in a group.</p><p>You can also form a guild for 1,000 Solaris—<em>Dune Awakening</em>’s in-game currency—and amass a small army of players for when you reach the Deep Desert. Sure, it’s expensive and you could use that money for better gear and other investments, but think about all the fun you’ll have with your buddies!</p><hr><p><em>Dune Awakening</em> launches on June 10th on PS5, Xbox Series X/S, and Windows PCs.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://kotaku.com/dune-awakening-multiplayer-1000-solaris-pvp-pve-hagga-1851784965]]></content:encoded>
