            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://kotaku.com/peacock-laid-the-bear-abbott-elementary-comedy-1851740602<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>The last 15 years have been a golden era of TV, minting generational treasures out of Cold War-era Russian spies posing as an American nuclear family (<em>The Americans</em>), a Black family fighting for their family legacy through protecting their land (<em>Queen Sugar</em>), a talking horse that swears (<em>BoJack Horseman</em>), and a surreal trip through the mecca of Black cool (<em>Atlanta</em>)<em>. </em>But, somewhere along the prestige TV path, humor went from straightforward absurdism that anyone can laugh at to overly intellectualized comedic vehicle to make drama more palatable. We stopped laughing out loud, and started laughing in our heads. </p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="197298" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="Live Forever in the Universe of 'New World: Aeternum'" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="108" data-playlist="197298,197284,197260" data-current="197298"><div><p>Live Forever in the Universe of 'New World: Aeternum'</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197298/197298_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197298/197298_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197298/197298_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197298/197298_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"></video></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>That’s why we need more shows like Peacock’s hilariously self-contained comedy <em>Laid</em>. </p><p>For eight 30-minute episodes, Ruby Yao (Stephanie Hsu) and her true-crime-obsessed best friend AJ (Zosia Mamet) trace every person Ruby had slept with after discovering that all of her sexual partners are dying in the order of when they had sex with her. In search of a way to stop the murders, the perpetually phenomenal Hsu tries to circumvent the curse with over-the-jeans dry humping, remembers her covid-era safe sex romp that had her and <em>Search Party</em>’s John Early trying to dirty talk through N95 masks, and tells her former throuple with Simu Liu that they could die soon.</p><p><em>Laid </em>doesn’t reinvent the wheel, but it does steamroll over any drama, flattening it into nothing more than soil from which humor can sprout. Ruby is taken to task by all of her ex-lovers over her inconsiderate actions, including drunkenly sleeping with AJ’s boyfriend and lying about it, and any deep self-examination she might engage in is promptly undercut as she makes a crude joke about her predicament. She’ll yell at an incompetent police officer about how much of a terrible person she is, then tell him she didn’t instinctively check to see if his partner was wearing a wedding ring because she instantly saw that he was gay. <em>Laid </em>is a laughs factory with a joke manufacturing strategy I wish other “comedies” followed. </p><p>We live in a world where an anxiety-riddled drama like <em>The Bear</em>, an existential deep dive into the psyche of a hitman like <em>Barry</em>, and an exploration into grief through the eyes of a children’s TV host like <em>Kidding</em> can all be nominated for Best Television Series – Musical or Comedy at the Golden Globes. All three are spectacular shows, but the laughs are few and far between. Post-<em>Breaking Bad</em>,<em>&nbsp;</em>Hollywood has become too enamored with the relatable antihero trope, to the point that it’s found its way into nearly every genre of TV. Why can’t we just have a goofball going through absurd situations in which the only real goal is to find new ways to make the audience laugh? </p><p>Luckily, we have shows like <em>Hacks</em>, <em>Abbott Elementary</em>, and, of course, <em>Laid</em>,<em>&nbsp;</em>making sure we remember that even fully fleshed-out human beings can be fuckin’ hilarious all of the time. </p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

The idea was to offer a more powerful version of the Chromebook to those who wanted that extra oomph. And before Christmas, Google sent me a new Chromebook Plus from Acer so I could check out this device’s gaming capabilities. After a few weeks with it, I’m happy to report that this is a solid laptop that I might buy in the future. But it’s not a great way to play most games.</p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="197298" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="Live Forever in the Universe of 'New World: Aeternum'" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="108" data-playlist="197298,197284,197260" data-current="197298"><div><p>Live Forever in the Universe of 'New World: Aeternum'</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197298/197298_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197298/197298_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197298/197298_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197298/197298_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"></video></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>The Acer 516 GE is the specific <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://blog.google/products/chromebooks/chromebook-plus/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://blog.google/products/chromebooks/chromebook-plus/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Chromebook Plus</a></span> I was sent to review. And before I leap into my issues with streaming on it, I should clarify that the device itself is sleek, modern, has a solid battery life, and never gave me any technical issues. Watching videos, writing, and surfing the web using the Acer Chromebook Plus was a very enjoyable experience. </p><p>In the past, I’ve used Chromebooks and didn’t enjoy it. The stripped-down ChromeOS-powered laptops have been around for a decade or so now, but whenever I touched one, I always walked away disappointed by the lack of performance and function. </p><p>Now, in 2025, as more apps are web-based and mobile hardware has become incredibly fast, using a Chromebook isn’t painful. In fact, while using the Acer 516 GE I would forget it was a Chromebook, as many things I do every day on a computer—check my email, chat with co-workers, read news, and write stories—are done through a browser anyway. As a result, I never had a problem using the Acer 516 GE. Well, until I tried to play games. </p><figure id="" data-id="12fed492be1ba3a93a07c1d4adb1f9c9" data-recommend-id="image://12fed492be1ba3a93a07c1d4adb1f9c9" data-format="jpg" data-width="2900" data-height="1000" data-lightbox="true" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Acer / Google</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="12fed492be1ba3a93a07c1d4adb1f9c9" data-recommend-id="image://12fed492be1ba3a93a07c1d4adb1f9c9" data-format="jpg" data-width="2900" data-height="1000" data-lightbox="true" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>The <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.acer.com/us-en/chromebooks/acer-chromebook-plus-516-ge-cbg516-2h&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.acer.com/us-en/chromebooks/acer-chromebook-plus-516-ge-cbg516-2h" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">516 GE Chromebook Plus</a></span> is marketed heavily as a gamer-focused device. Google sent it to me, a writer at <em>Kotaku</em>, because its supposedly a gamer-friendly device. But if you know anything about ChomeOS and Chromebooks, you know that these things can’t play high-end games. The solution? The power of the cloud.</p><p>That’s the big selling point of the 516 GE. You don’t have to download games or worry about tech requirements. Just log into your preferred game streaming service and play stuff like<em> Cyberpunk 2077</em> or <em>Fortnite </em>instantly. And maybe, in another five years, this promise will become a reality, but for now streaming games is still a bad way to play stuff. </p><p>I tried <em>Fortnite, Cyberpunk 2077, </em>and <em>Gears 5</em> using different methods including Game Pass, Nvidia Geforce Now, and Amazon Luna. And while some were better than others, none of them matched the experience of playing a game natively on a device like a console or PC. </p><figure id="" data-id="afe4301ec93c83e2acd32ccf9b069fd3" data-recommend-id="image://afe4301ec93c83e2acd32ccf9b069fd3" data-format="png" data-width="1195" data-height="682" data-lightbox="true" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Acer / Google</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="afe4301ec93c83e2acd32ccf9b069fd3" data-recommend-id="image://afe4301ec93c83e2acd32ccf9b069fd3" data-format="png" data-width="1195" data-height="682" data-lightbox="true" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Now, you can install Steam on the 516 GE (it has a speical built-in feature to allow this) and using what I assume is Proton, I was able to play some 2D games like <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/balatro-poker-roguelike-worth-it-is-it-good-review-pc-1851283124&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/balatro-poker-roguelike-worth-it-is-it-good-review-pc-1851283124"><em>Vampire</em> <em>Survivors </em>and <em>Balatro</em></a></span><em> </em>just fine on the 516 GE. But that’s not impressive in a world where my phone can do that, too. No, the big selling point of this device is being able to play high-end, AAA video games on the go with no downloading and without having to shell out thousands of dollars on a dedicated gaming laptop.</p><p>Sadly, in 2025, even with Google Fiber internet (which I have), the 516 GE can’t remove the lag, choppiness, and visual artifacts that you encounter when streaming games. </p><p>So, if you are looking for a powerful Chromebook that can play some basic 2D games and retro stuff (I was able to get <em>Turok </em>running on it without any issues) then the 516 GE is worth checking out. Just don’t expect it and its game-streaming capabilities to replace your Switch, Steam Deck, or PS5 anytime soon. </p><p> .<br></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
