I’m nowhere close to finishing it. The average play times seem to range from 15-25 hours to “beat” the game, but people have kept play for double that to explore every nook and cranny. But I’m far enough to begin “getting” what’s so special about it and can see why it’s being praised by early critics. <br></p><p><em>Blue Prince</em> has a <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.metacritic.com/game/blue-prince/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.metacritic.com/game/blue-prince/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Metacritic score of 92</a></span> with reviews from just over 20 outlets so far. That puts it at the top of the aggregating site’s ranked list for 2025, and just one point ahead of <em>Split Fiction</em>. This year’s other top-rated games so far include <em>Monster Hunter Wilds</em>, <em>Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2</em>, and fellow puzzle adventure <em>The Roottrees Are Dead</em>. <em>Blue Prince</em> is much harder to talk about than those games, though, in part because explaining too much can ruin the joy of discovery what’s so great about it, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/outer-wilds-is-one-of-the-best-games-ive-ever-played-1835801654&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/outer-wilds-is-one-of-the-best-games-ive-ever-played-1835801654">similar to <em>The Outer Wilds</em></a></span>. </p><p>It’s enough to know the basic premise: you’re exploring a mansion that will be bequeathed to you from a dead relative if you can discover its hidden 46th room. Every time you hit a doorway you can select from a set of rooms to “draft” on the blueprints (Get it? <em>Blue Prince</em>?) for it to appear on the other side. This will impact what resources, clues, and additional doorways you find inside. Once you deplete your “stamina” for the day you go home and rest, coming back the next morning to a completely blank slate to be drafted all over again with the help of everything you’ve learned and new room types you’ve unlocked.</p><p>“Later runs in <em>Blue Prince</em> are less about puzzle solving or deckbuilding, and more about excursionary quests into the house to solve certain puzzles (“Can I somehow get the Boiler Room to connect to the Laboratory?”) or information gathering sessions as you try to piece together a message obliquely scattered across all but one room in the mansion,” <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://astrolabe.aidanmoher.com/blue-prince-raw-fury-review/?ref=astrolabe-newsletter&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://astrolabe.aidanmoher.com/blue-prince-raw-fury-review/?ref=astrolabe-newsletter" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">writes Aidan Moher</a></span>. “It’s about unravelling the spooled mystery behind the mansion and its titular blue prince, a fascist nation, and the cost of freedom. It’s not so much about solving puzzles as it is about understanding the link between agency, experience, and story. Journey before destination.”</p><p>This might not sound like everyone’s cup of tea, but a really nice bonus for <em>Blue Prince</em> is that the it’ll be practically free for millions of players who are already subscribed to Game Pass on Xbox and PC or PS Plus on PlayStation 5. “Polished indie puzzle game with simple mechanics but bold ideas on a subscription service” recalls last year’s<em> Animal Well</em>, a <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/animal-well-review-metroidvania-puzzle-2024-goty-1851465730&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/animal-well-review-metroidvania-puzzle-2024-goty-1851465730">strong 2024 GOTY contender</a></span> in its own right. But there are two notable distinctions. Calling <em>Blue Prince</em> a “<span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.nintendolife.com/features/what-the-heck-is-a-metroidbrainia-introducing-the-newest-genre-on-the-block&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.nintendolife.com/features/what-the-heck-is-a-metroidbrainia-introducing-the-newest-genre-on-the-block" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Metroidbrania</a></span>” would probably make people who use that genre nickname mad, and also <em>Animal Well </em>was <em>only</em> on PS Plus. This time around, players on every platform get to take advantage of a a big day-and-date get for subscription services (except Switch). </p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Instead, the animated movie features three separate stories about different Predator aliens hunting down warriors and soldiers in different time periods. So for example, we will see a Predator fighting soldiers in World War II and another Predator hunting a samurai in feudal Japan. </p><p>Here’s the official synopsis for the movie: </p><blockquote data-type="BlockQuote"><p>The anthology story follows three of the fiercest warriors in human history: a Viking raider guiding her young son on a bloody quest for revenge, a ninja in feudal Japan who turns against his Samurai brother in a brutal battle for succession, and a WWII pilot who takes to the sky to investigate an otherworldly threat to the Allied cause. But while all these warriors are killers in their own right, they are merely prey for their new opponent – the ultimate killer of killers.</p></blockquote><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/predator-prey-2-badlands-secret-movie-animated-hulu-1851681811&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/predator-prey-2-badlands-secret-movie-animated-hulu-1851681811">In October 2024</a></span>, it was reported that an animated <em>Predator </em>movie was in the works <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/prey-2-predator-badlands-filming-new-zealand-trailer-1851636314&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/prey-2-predator-badlands-filming-new-zealand-trailer-1851636314">alongside a live-action <em>Predator </em>movie</a></span>. Both were directed and led by Dan Trachtenberg, who has sort of become the man in charge of the<em> Predator</em> franchise ever since his 2022 movie <em>Prey </em>became a big hit with critics and fans. That movie featured a Predator hunting Native Americans in the 1700s. </p><p>Speaking to press after showing off footage of <em>Killer of Killers</em>, Trachtenberg said that the animated flick was inspired by <em>Prey</em> and the question of what kinds of stories could you tell if you plopped a Predator in different time periods. And he also wanted to make a gory <em>Predator </em>movie in a new medium. </p><p>“I love in <em>Predator</em> movies, [the] hard-R, crazy carnage,” <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.gamesradar.com/entertainment/sci-fi-movies/a-surprise-new-predator-animated-movie-is-releasing-very-soon-as-its-director-talks-arcane-inspiration-and-bringing-hard-r-crazy-carnage-to-predator-killer-of-killers/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.gamesradar.com/entertainment/sci-fi-movies/a-surprise-new-predator-animated-movie-is-releasing-very-soon-as-its-director-talks-arcane-inspiration-and-bringing-hard-r-crazy-carnage-to-predator-killer-of-killers/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">said the director as reported by <em>GamesRadar</em></a></span>. “Wouldn’t it be cool to see that in a different medium? So we made this movie, <em>Killer of Killers</em>, at the exact same time— stupidly, but awesomely—and it is an anthology movie.” </p><p>Trachtenberg also confirmed that <em>Killer of Killers</em> was visually inspired by Netflix’s <em>Arcane</em> series and that some people who worked on that show helped out on the new movie. </p><p><em>Predator: Killers of Killers</em> arrives on Hulu and Disney+ on June 6.</p><p>&nbsp;.<br></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
