After weeks of tragically ensnaring some of the puzzle adventure’s biggest fans, a new patch fixes the issue alongside implementing a nerf for an infinite item exploit. </p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="197541" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="Civilization VII’s Latest Update Finally Feels Like The Game Fans Were Promised" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="147" data-playlist="197541,196447,195410" data-current="197541"><div><p>Civilization VII’s Latest Update Finally Feels Like The Game Fans Were Promised</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197541/197541_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197541/197541_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197541/197541_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/23067.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>“This issue was caused by a duplication of save data causing new save information to time out and not be saved,” the game’s developer, Tonda Ros, posted on Steam. “This problem has now been addressed and players should have no issues progressing and saving the game past the point where the bug was initially encountered.”</p><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/blue-prince-metacritic-game-pass-ps-plus-switch-1851775306&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/blue-prince-metacritic-game-pass-ps-plus-switch-1851775306"><em>Blue Prince</em> is about exploring a mansion</a></span> where, at the start of each new day, you choose which room comes next from a growing deck of cards as you seek to discover a missing 46th room. Solving puzzles and uncovering clues in this roguelite structure eventually gives way to some big mysteries and lots of backstory, with some players spending over a hundred hours navigating the deepest layers of its esoteric labyrinth. </p><p>But on PS5, some of those players were hitting a save bug long before their time in the mansion felt complete. The<em> Blue Prince</em> subreddit <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/BluePrince/search/?q=corrupted+&amp;cId=3a7cd65a-1fe3-4ca5-8a39-a17677129df0&amp;iId=3f927640-8144-48f4-8ec2-64824e8ff3fd&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/BluePrince/search/?q=corrupted+&amp;cId=3a7cd65a-1fe3-4ca5-8a39-a17677129df0&amp;iId=3f927640-8144-48f4-8ec2-64824e8ff3fd" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">is littered</a></span> with horror stories of people who fell down the rabbit hole only to see all of their progress erased.  Most players were hit somewhere between day 90 and 150.</p><p>“I play this wonder of a game on PS5, and after 117 days, I had the horror of discovering my save is locked on day 117, I keep playing for hours and saving but when I leave the game, I am back to that day 117,” one <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/BluePrince/comments/1k4dif6/75_hours_i_think_my_save_is_dead/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/BluePrince/comments/1k4dif6/75_hours_i_think_my_save_is_dead/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">wrote</a></span>. “I have finally reached the true ps5 endgame,” <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/BluePrince/comments/1knbpk6/i_have_finally_reached_the_true_ps5_endgame_save/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/BluePrince/comments/1knbpk6/i_have_finally_reached_the_true_ps5_endgame_save/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">wrote</a></span> another. “Save file bug.”</p><p>The good news is that those save files should now work, assuming players didn’t restart or delete them. “We have worked tirelessly with Sony to avoid any save files being lost once the game patches,” Ros wrote. “However, content that was not saved during the Rollback Issue has unfortunately been lost. Players should be able to return to Mount Holly at the point where they encountered the bug.”</p><p>It’s still a major bummer for everyone who was affected, especially since <em>Blue Prince</em> is not the best game for returning to weeks later after you’ve entered a completely different headspace. Today’s patch makes a fair number of other changes as well, most of which are redacted for spoiler reasons. </p><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/BluePrince/comments/1ksu5e6/psa_the_new_patch_fixes_the_2_most_know_exploits/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/BluePrince/comments/1ksu5e6/psa_the_new_patch_fixes_the_2_most_know_exploits/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Two things players have also noticed</a></span>, however, are fixes to the  Guest Bedroom exploit which players could use to load up on items, and to the Nurse Station buff players were manipulating to gain extra steps. It turns out even <em>Blue Prince</em> isn’t immune to busted builds getting nerfed. </p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

I love the moral conundrums it presents, the violent grief it depicts, and the games’ excellent writing that poignantly brings all of those complicated emotions to the surface. What I don’t like is listening to pretty much any of the creative team talk about the series, especially when it comes to weighing in on decade-long discourse around its complex storylines. Even when I agree with series director Neil Druckmann’s interpretation of something, we’d all rather he just let bad readings fester in the corners of the internet than tell us exactly what something means. Nevertheless, he continues to do so in interviews.</p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="196345" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="The Week In Games: Pokémon With Guns And More New Releases" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="126" data-playlist="196345,196196,195776" data-current="196345"><div><p>The Week In Games: Pokémon With Guns And More New Releases</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196345/196345_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196345/196345_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196345/196345_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196345/196345_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/21893.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>In a discussion with the <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O8tOTQhepAI&amp;ab_channel=LastStandMedia&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O8tOTQhepAI&amp;ab_channel=LastStandMedia" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sacred Symbols</a></span> podcast (thanks, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.ign.com/articles/the-last-of-us-part-1-finale-question-definitively-answered-by-series-creator-upending-years-of-fan-debate&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-last-of-us-part-1-finale-question-definitively-answered-by-series-creator-upending-years-of-fan-debate" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>IGN</em></a></span>), Druckmann talked about the end of <em>The Last of Us Part I</em>, which was <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/tlou-last-of-us-recap-s1e9-finale-joel-ellie-giraffe-1850217781&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/tlou-last-of-us-recap-s1e9-finale-joel-ellie-giraffe-1850217781">adapted for television</a></span> in the HBO show’s first season. In this climactic moment, Joel—a smuggler turned surrogate father to Ellie, the young girl immune to a fungal infection that has leveled the series’ post-apocalyptic world—massacres members of a revolutionary group called the Fireflies who sought to use Ellie’s immunity to create a vaccine. They could potentially have saved millions of lives and helped society rebuild again after decades of ruin. But after months of traveling across the United States to reach the group’s base in Salt Lake City, Joel wasn’t willing to lose Ellie for something as small as the possibility of a world-saving vaccine. After the player fights their way through the facility and escapes with Ellie, Joel lies to her about what happened, and they live happily ever after(?) in Jackson, Wyoming…until the sequel, at least.</p><p>It’s a nuanced situation, and ever since <em>The Last of Us </em>launched in 2013, fans have debated the ethics of pretty much every character in this finale. However, one part of the discussion that has persisted is the question of whether or not the Fireflies would have been able to successfully create a cure or vaccine in the first place. This is the post-apocalypse. They’ve got one surgeon here who claims to be able to do the job, and even if they managed to concoct a vaccine, how would they distribute it? All of that is an interesting logistical discussion, but some fans have taken that talking point a step further and tried to claim the potential success of the plan was ever part of Joel’s motivations. It’s very obvious that the man cares about Ellie’s life above all else, and didn’t stop to weigh up the vagueries of vaccine efficacy in a zombie apocalypse I’ve always read these attempts to explain away Joel’s guilt as cope, and the idea that he had a firm confidence that the Fireflies’ attempts would fail as an effort to wash away the reality of Joel’s actions.</p><p>Yet now, Druckmann has confirmed that it was always the intention for the group’s medical team to be able to create the cure, essentially nuking that talking point. Am I upset that we can now put this obviously desperate theory to bed? No. Do I wish Druckmann would stop giving definitive answers to a story that has thrived in ambiguity and interpretation? Absolutely.</p><p>“Our intent was yes, they could [make a cure],” Druckmann said. “Now, is our science a little shaky that now people are now questioning it? Sure. Our science is a little shaky and people are now questioning it. I can’t say anything. I can say our intent was that they would have made a cure. That makes the most interesting philosophical question for what Joel does.”</p><p>Sure, it’s the most interesting interpretation because it actually interrogates everything you know about Joel based on how he presents. Giving him an out is just refusing to engage with the text. Do you want to debate if the Fireflies were <em>equipped</em> to save the world with a vaccine? That’s an entirely separate discussion from Joel’s motivations. But even so, we don’t need every detail spelt out. Maybe it’s because Druckmann is being constantly interviewed about this series after two games, more remasters than I care to count, and two seasons of television, but the more we talk to this dude (and HBO series showrunner Craig Mazin) and ask him to tell us what it all meant, the less interesting the story can be. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/last-of-us-season-2-joel-was-right-hbo-max-finale-1851773550&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/last-of-us-season-2-joel-was-right-hbo-max-finale-1851773550">I don’t want to know if Druckmann thinks Joel was right</a></span>. I don’t need the author to tell me what I’m supposed to feel.

Just let it speak for itself.</p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
