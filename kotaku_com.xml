Yet, the legendary author who’s published 65 books and has dozens of films inspired by his imagination machine of a mind has found time for one more first: his first animated feature. <em>Lily</em> became King’s first-ever animated short, and its origins trace back all the way to his high school days.</p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="195928" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="How Alan Wake 2 Builds Upon The 'Remedy-Verse'" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="190" data-playlist="195928,197585,197583" data-current="195928"><div><p>How Alan Wake 2 Builds Upon The 'Remedy-Verse'</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195928/195928_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195928/195928_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195928/195928_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195928/195928_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/21446.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>In the pop-up-book-styled animated short, a young student named Robert is stuck between a rock and a nightmare as he has to deal with his cruel teacher, Ms. Sidley, and a large tiger named Lily in the bathroom. After his teacher berates him for choosing to urinate outside to avoid the tiger, her inspection of his claims has a devastating consequence for her. There’s no blood or gore—trademark components of many of our favorite Stephen King visual adaptations. There’s just kid-friendly horror in the Kate Siegel-directed short, which is exactly how King intended for it to be when he wrote the script according to <em>Lily</em>’s animator Pete Scalzitti, who spoke with <em>Kotaku </em>after the short’s screening at this year’s Tribeca Film Festival.</p><p>“Last summer Stephen wrote our screenplay, adapting it himself from one of his earliest stories ever, <em>Here There Be Tygers</em>, which he actually wrote when he was in high school,” Scalzitti explains. “Deep cut fans of his short stories will notice he changed some of the plot, as well as the names of the main characters, using instead the names from another of his darkest short stories, <em>Suffer the Little Children</em>. But the plot is all <em>Tygers</em>.”</p><p><em>Here There Be Tygers</em> was released in 1968 when the prolific author was only 20 years old, and <em>Suffer the Little Children</em> was published four years later in 1972, making <em>Lily</em> a sterling example of the timelessness of King’s work. The hand-drawn animation makes <em>Lily</em> feel like it was pulled from a time capsule unblemished, and also makes it reminiscent of children’s picture books. All of this was intentional, even down to the way Siegel’s voice guides you through the horror.</p><p>“Kate chose to leave in Stephen’s screen directions and use them as narration, which she discussed with Stephen. This made the film feel like King was reading us a bedtime story, which gave me my solution for how to animate this in 21 days—I treated it like I was creating a pop-up book.”</p><p><em>Lily</em> is part of <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.youtube.com/@darkcornersfilms/videos&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.youtube.com/@darkcornersfilms/videos" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>Dark Corners</em></a></span>, a series created by Siegel and Krsy Fox, which features eight animated horror shorts meant to “gently or not so gently introduce children to the world of horror.” While there isn’t any official word on if and when King decides to drop another, don’t put it past the master of horror to dig back into his treasure trove of stories for an animated feast of terror for the eyes.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

It’s part of a “Play Anywhere” promise that includes PC, existing Series X/S consoles, Game Pass on TVs, cloud gaming, and first-party exclusives ported to PlayStation 5 and Nintendo Switch. It all sounds like a promising pivot away from the company’s shrinking console business, but it also raises lots of questions about what the future of Xbox will actually look like. </p><p>A new generation of Xbox consoles is coming, but will they be traditional consoles or mini-PC devices running an evolving version of Windows? Bond stresses compatibility with existing players’ current libraries of Xbox games, but most Xbox games haven’t been ported to PC and would need specialty solutions to maintain access at the hardware level rather than just making them playable with cloud gaming like Sony does with the PS3 generation. Will it even have a disc drive? <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/xbox-rog-ally-physical-code-outer-worlds-1851784446?_gl=1*9060vv*_ga*MTc0MjY2NTg1OS4xNzQwMzc1OTc4*_ga_V4QNJTT5L0*czE3NTAxNjYxNzQkbzEzMiRnMCR0MTc1MDE2NjE3NyRqNTckbDAkaDA.&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/xbox-rog-ally-physical-code-outer-worlds-1851784446?_gl=1*9060vv*_ga*MTc0MjY2NTg1OS4xNzQwMzc1OTc4*_ga_V4QNJTT5L0*czE3NTAxNjYxNzQkbzEzMiRnMCR0MTc1MDE2NjE3NyRqNTckbDAkaDA.">Increasingly, the vibe appears to be no</a></span>. <br></p><p>Bond also emphasizes that the future of Xbox isn’t tied to a single store or device, once again opening the door to new hardware potentially supporting things like Steam, which has traditionally been a competitor to Windows gaming. Then there’s the bit about working to “ensure that Windows is the number one platform for gaming.” Unless that’s simply a nod to the fact that most PCs people play games on also run Windows, it sounds like a hint that the foundation of Xbox’s future will be Microsoft’s current cash cow OS with an Xbox layer overtop, rather than a bespoke platform built from the ground up for gaming as Xbox has previously been. <em>The Verge</em>’s Tom Warren suggested as much in <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.theverge.com/notepad-microsoft-newsletter/686101/microsoft-xbox-next-gen-console-handheld-hints-notepad&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.theverge.com/notepad-microsoft-newsletter/686101/microsoft-xbox-next-gen-console-handheld-hints-notepad" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">his breakdown of the Xbox Ally last week</a></span>. </p><p>“Everything, everywhere, whenever you want” is a compelling marketing pitch that could easily become bedeviled by the details. As it stands, no single company controls as many pieces of the puzzle as Microsoft—software, hardware, and a massive publishing apparatus—but that doesn’t mean they will magically all start fitting together in a way that makes sense or doesn’t require tons of extra investment. And the other truth about Xbox at the moment is it seems burdened more than ever by they need to justify its P&amp;L to the larger company, which is otherwise all but obsessed with cloud computing and AI. <br></p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
