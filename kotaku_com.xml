              <p>In most extraction shooters, as well as a number of online survival games, players are all-too-familiar with the necessary evil known as a global wipe, in which everyone’s inventory and stats get reset to start all players off again on the same footing. It can sting a bit, but it helps balance out the game for newcomers, as folks who’ve been playing for years could otherwise build up a virtually limitless stockpile of goodies to maintain supremacy. Upcoming PvPvE extraction shooter <i>Arc Raiders</i>, however, has some different ideas on how to implement this in a way that won’t cost everyone their precious, hard-won loot.</p> <p>In particular, the developers are trying to solve one of the biggest problems with mandatory wipes: It’s really unfair to those who only have limited windows of opportunity to play the game. It sucks when you log a few hours in one week, get tied up with life stuff for the remainder of a month, then come back to find out even the meager earnings you scored during that first week are now gone due to the wipe. <i>Arc Raiders </i>developer Embark is aiming to solve that.</p>

 <p>In a blog post titled “<a href="https://arcraiders.com/en/news/expedition-project/">Expedition Project</a>,” <i>Arc Raiders’</i> design director Virgil said that the studio “absolutely [sees] the benefits a global wipe provides [but] one thing a mandatory wipe does not do is respect the investment of those players who do not have as much time to play overall.”</p>

 <p>Enter “Projects,” a feature that unlocks after level 20 with a scheduled eight-week window to complete, after which you’ll unlock the ability to reset your character. Should you fail to finish your project within the eight-week window, you can hold on to all of the progress you made, including your gear. You can then continue your progress during the next eight-week period that opens up.</p>

Hopefully <i>Arc Raiders</i>’ Projects will solve that dilemma.</p>
