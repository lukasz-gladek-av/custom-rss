              <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/borderlands-4-split-screen-coop-switch-2-amon-skill-tree-2000618064"><em>Borderlands 4</em></a> is almost here. The next installment in Gearbox and 2K’s fan-favorite co-op looter shooter series is launching on September 12 on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC. (The Switch 2 port arrives next month.) Ahead of its launch, we’ve compiled a list of useful information about <a href="https://kotaku.com/borderlands-4-pax-west-rage-room-gearbox-2000621767"><em>Borderlands 4</em></a> to help quickly answer your questions ahead of its release. Does it support cross-save? When will it be playable? Do I need to beat the other games? All that and more is answered below!</p> <h2><strong>When does <em>Borderlands 4</em> launch?&nbsp;</strong></h2> <p><em>Borderlands 4</em> launches on PS5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC on September 12. Sort of. It depends on where you live and what platform you are planning to play the looter shooter on. Here’s the full breakdown courtesy of <a href="https://borderlands.2k.com/borderlands-4/news/global-launch-times/">2K Games and Gearbox</a>.</p> <blockquote><p><em><strong>Xbox and PlayStation launch times</strong></em></p></blockquote> <ul> <li> <blockquote><p>Wellington, New Zealand – Sept 12 at 12:00 AM NZST</p></blockquote> </li> <li> <blockquote><p>Sydney, Australia – Sept 12 at 12:00 AM AEST</p></blockquote> </li> <li> <blockquote><p>Tokyo, Japan – Sept 12 at 12:00 AM JST</p></blockquote> </li> <li> <blockquote><p>Singapore – Sept 12 at 12:00 AM SGT</p></blockquote> </li> <li> <blockquote><p>London, UK – Sept 12 at 12:00 AM BST</p></blockquote> </li> <li> <blockquote><p>New York, NY, USA – Sept 12 at 12:00 AM ET</p></blockquote> </li> <li> <blockquote><p>San Francisco, CA, USA – Sept 11 at 9:00 PM PT</p></blockquote> </li> </ul> <p>Meanwhile, on Steam and Epic’s PC store, you’ll be able to play earlier than on consoles. Here are those dates and times:</p> <blockquote><p><strong><em>Steam &amp; Epic Store launch times</em></strong></p></blockquote> <ul> <li> <blockquote><p>Wellington, New Zealand – Sept 12 at 4:00 AM NZST</p></blockquote> </li> <li> <blockquote><p>Sydney, Australia – Sept 12 at 2:00 AM AEST</p></blockquote> </li> <li> <blockquote><p>Tokyo, Japan – Sept 12 at 1:00 AM JST</p></blockquote> </li> <li> <blockquote><p>Singapore – Sept 12 at 12:00 AM SGT</p></blockquote> </li> <li> <blockquote><p>London, UK – Sept 11 at 5:00 PM BST</p></blockquote> </li> <li> <blockquote><p>New York, NY, USA – Sept 11 at 12:00 PM ET</p></blockquote> </li> <li> <blockquote><p>San Francisco, CA, USA – Sept 11 at 9:00 AM PT</p></blockquote> </li> </ul> <h2><strong>Wait, isn’t this coming out on Switch 2?&nbsp;</strong></h2> <p>Yes!<em> Borderlands 4</em> is coming to Switch 2, but not until next month. Gearbox and 2K are bringing the looter shooter to Nintendo’s new console on October 3.</p>

 <blockquote><p><em><strong>Switch 2 launch times</strong></em></p></blockquote> <ul> <li> <blockquote><p>Wellington, New Zealand – Oct 3 at 12:00 AM NZST</p></blockquote> </li> <li> <blockquote><p>Sydney, Australia – Oct 3 at 12:00 AM AEST</p></blockquote> </li> <li> <blockquote><p>Tokyo, Japan – Oct 3 at 12:00 AM JST</p></blockquote> </li> <li> <blockquote><p>Singapore – Oct 3 at 12:00 AM SGT</p></blockquote> </li> <li> <blockquote><p>London, UK – Oct 3 at 12:00 AM BST</p></blockquote> </li> <li> <blockquote><p>New York, NY, USA – Oct 3 at 12:00 AM ET</p></blockquote> </li> <li> <blockquote><p>San Francisco, CA, USA – Oct 2 at 9:00 PM PT</p></blockquote> </li> </ul> <h2><strong>What versions of <em>Borderlands 4</em> are available to buy?&nbsp;</strong></h2> <p><a href="https://borderlands.2k.com/borderlands-4/buy/">The are three versions of <em>Borderlands 4</em> being sold by 2K</a>. The standard edition is $70 and comes with the game and…that’s it.</p> <p>Then there’s the Deluxe Edition, which costs $100 and comes with the Bounty Pack bundle and Firehawk’s Fury Weapon Skin bundle. (The Bounty Pack includes a few smaller narrative DLC missions that will be added post-launch via various updates.)</p> <p>Finally, the $130 Super Deluxe Edition comes with everything previously mentioned, and grants access to new upcoming expansions, two new Vault Hunters, and a new cosmetic bundle.</p>

 <p>Regardless of which version you buy, if you pre-order before <em>Borderlands 4</em> launches on your platform,<a href="https://borderlands.2k.com/borderlands-4/news/global-launch-times/#:~:text=For%20a%20quick,Daedalus%20Assault%20Rifle"> you’ll <em>also</em> get a bonus “Gilded Glory” pack</a> that includes:</p> <ul> <li>1 Vault Hunter Head usable by all Vault Hunters</li> <li>1 Vault Hunter Skin usable by all Vault Hunters</li> <li>1 Weapon Skin</li> <li>1 ECHO-4 Drone Skin</li> <li>4 pieces of Legendary Gear:</li> <li>1 Lvl 1 Legendary Maliwan SMG</li> <li>1 Lvl 30 Legendary Ripper Grenade</li> <li>1 Lvl 30 Legendary Torgue Ordnance</li> <li>1 Max Lvl Legendary Daedalus Assault Rifle</li> </ul> <h2><strong>Does <em>Borderlands 4</em> support crossplay and cross-save?&nbsp;</strong></h2> <p>Yes and no.<em> Borderlands 4</em> on all platforms will support crossplay at launch. So if you are on PC and your friend is on Xbox, you can play together easily, assuming you both have free Gearbox Shift accounts.</p> <p>Sadly, neither cross-save nor cross-progression will be available on day one. But, <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1285190/view/543366456574738739">Gearbox has confirmed in a Steam post</a> that it is looking to add the features later, letting players hop from one console to another and keep all their progress. Just don’t expect that on September 12.</p>

 <h2><strong>Is there a day-one patch?&nbsp;</strong></h2> <p>Yes! Gearbox CEO and co-founder Randy Pitchford has confirmed that, like most big AAA video games these days, <a href="https://x.com/DuvalMagic/status/1964424122861064640"><em>Borderlands 4</em> will have a day-one patch.</a> According to Pitchford, the update should help improve the game’s performance on PC, but did warn that <em>Borderlands 4</em> is a big open-world game that might not run well on older hardware even after the update.</p> <h2><strong>What are <em>Borderlands 4′</em>s recommended and minimum PC specs?&nbsp;</strong></h2> <div data-os="win"> <div> <p><strong>Minimum:</strong></p> <ul> <li> <ul> <li>Requires a 64-bit processor and operating system</li> <li><strong>OS:</strong>&nbsp;Windows 10 / Windows 11</li> <li><strong>Processor:</strong>&nbsp;Intel Core i7-9700 / AMD Ryzen 7 2700X</li> <li><strong>Memory:</strong>&nbsp;16 GB RAM</li> <li><strong>Graphics:</strong>&nbsp;NVIDIA GeForce RTX 2070 / AMD Radeon RX 5700 XT / Intel Arc A580</li> <li><strong>Storage:</strong>&nbsp;100 GB available space</li> <li><strong>Additional Notes:</strong>&nbsp;Requires a 64-bit processor and operating system.

Meanwhile, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/borderlands-4-switch-2-will-run-mostly-30-fps/"><em>Borderlands 4</em> on Switch 2 seems to be targeting 30FPS,</a> which isn’t surprising.</p> <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">Target 60fps.</p> <p>Also, F’ balance.

But you don’t have to. <em>Borderlands 4 </em>is set on a new planet, featuring new characters, and is a more self-contained story than the last few games. Sure, super fans will pick up on clues to the larger universe and past titles, but don’t feel like you need to play everything before starting up <em>Borderlands 4.&nbsp;</em></p> <h2><strong>Should I watch the movie?&nbsp;</strong></h2> <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/borderlands-movie-review-rotten-tomatoes-cast-release-1851616912">lol. Don’t do that. Come on now. Be kind to yourself.</a></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-is-fine-but-digimon-story-cyber-sleuth-is-one-1839230688"><em>Digimon Story: Cyber Sleuth</em></a> was sneakily one of the best RPGs of 2016. Almost a decade later, its long-awaited successor is mounting another lowkey coup in a genre that’s only gotten more competitive in the years since. <em>Digimon Story: Time Stranger</em> plays like a very traditional turn-based role-playing game in all of my favorite ways while bringing multiple generational leaps’ worth of technical upgrades to a spin-off series whose last entries were built for PS Vita. It feels like the <em>Persona</em>-style glow-up many <em>Pokémon</em> fans have been waiting for.</p> <p>At PAX West last week I had the chance to play over 90 minutes of <em>Digimon Story: Time</em> <em>Stranger</em>, which comes to PS5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC on October 3, and the latest Bandai Namco-published creature fighter from veteran RPG maker Media Vision did not disappoint. Things already seemed good coming out of a <a href="https://kotaku.com/digmon-story-time-stranger-preview-pokemon-pc-ps5-xbox-1851784677">Summer Game Fest demo</a> earlier this summer and a deeper dive only firmed up the sense that the game, first announced eight years ago, can meet the increasing expectations surrounding <em>Digimon Story</em>‘s return.</p> <p>The latest session let me play the start of the game before later shifting to a much more advanced segment over a dozen hours into the adventure. You play as a secret agent working for the ADAMAS organization investigating ominous anomalies in Tokyo that seem to be linked to social upheaval. The <em>Digimon Story</em> games have always had an emphasis on compelling conversations and background intrigue, which <em>Cyber Sleuth</em> took to the next level with a narrative that felt like more than just a means to an end of raising virtual pets.</p>

 <figure id="attachment_2000624121" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000624121"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000624121">Bandai Namco</figcaption></figure> <p>What I played of <em>Time Stranger</em> continues that with English voice acting and more polished cinematic animations, coupled with an unusually stellar soundtrack. Are there extremely goofy moments too? Absolutely. I’ve already witnessed half a dozen snippets that I can’t wait to send to folks in the group chat who have not interacted with <em>Digimon</em> since it debuted in the West on Fox Kids back in 1999. Watching familiar RPG tropes reenacted by absurd-looking creatures that speak like humans is an acquired taste, but <em>Time Stranger</em> does an admirable job.</p> <p>Eerie anime vibes established, my early tutorial section eventually transitioned to a later stretch set in the Digimon world’s colorful seaside Abyss Area which felt oddly reminiscent of<em> Chrono Cross</em>‘ tropical archipelago. Here, <em>Time Stranger</em>‘s bread and butter took center stage: fighting, collecting, and growing your Digimon. There’s the combat triangle between Data, Virus, and Vaccine type Digimon, elemental weaknesses, and a swapping system that lets you use different Digimon on the fly if your current team doesn’t have the right build.</p>

 <p>Building meter during battle also lets you unleash an ultimate attack to deal extra damage or buff your team. It’s a nimble set of mechanics that helps turn-based battles shine, forcing you to think about what you’re doing and adapt on the fly without getting bogged down in too much minutiae. It’s definitely old-school but more satisfying than just mashing the same set of attacks over and over again. If things do start to get repetitive, a fast-forward button helps bypass the boring bits. Defeat a Digimon enough times and you get a 100 percent scan rate to create your own, or you can wait for a 200 percent scan rate to get an even stronger version of it.</p> <figure id="attachment_2000624122" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000624122"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000624122">Bandai Namco</figcaption></figure> <p>Outside of combat, the main focus remains on Digivolving and De-Digivolving your pals. The first makes them more powerful while the second makes them weaker again in the short term to raise their long-term potential. Aiding this convoluted process is the DigiFarm system which lets you tweak the new personalities of your Digimon to change which stats grow the fastest. Certain personalities are also required to Digivolve or De-Digivolve specific Digimon along with player rank and relationship status. Consumable items and training sessions let you speed up this process too.</p>

 <p>There’s also an entire character skill tree full of perks that provide extra bonuses to your team depending on a Digimon’s specific relationship with you and their personality type, though I didn’t get to see how these systems feel over the long haul. Do they feel balanced? Do they get tedious? Is it too streamlined or too convoluted? But I certainly came away with the impression that <em>Time Stranger</em> has a great foundation to work with.</p> <p>Will it hold up over a 40-50 hour adventure? Is it well paced? Does the story end up going somewhere cool even if you’re not a dyed-in-the-wool <em>Digimon</em> sicko? Only the full, finished game can answer those questions. So far, however, the successor to <em>Digimon Story: Cyber Sleuth</em> continues to look like it’s making smart choices and pushing the series forward. It could easily be overshadowed next month by <em>Pokémon Legends: Z-A</em> but it doesn’t deserve to be. <em>Digimon Story: Time Stranger</em> should be on every RPG fan’s radar, whether they’ve been keeping up with the franchise or not.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/silksongs-most-popular-mods-make-it-easier-too-hard-boss-fights-2000624107</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/silksong%E2%80%99s-most-popular-mods-are-all-about-making-the-game-easier.1291866/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/tag/hollow-knight-silksong"><em>Hollow Knight: Silksong </em></a>is out. Did you know that? You probably pieced that together. After seven years of waiting, Team Cherry’s long-awaited 2D action-platformer is here and kicking people’s asses. But on PC, thousands of players are using mods to help them overcome the challenging game.</p> <p><em>Silksong</em> released late last week on Xbox, PlayStation, Switch, and PC after nearly a decade of waiting. And first reactions to the sequel are almost entirely positive, with fans loving the small tweaks to the<em> Hollow Knight</em> formula and the larger size of its world. Plus, that $20 price tag is nice in an era when everything is more expensive than ever. And <em>Silksong</em>, like <em>Hollow Knight</em>, isn’t the easiest game in the world. Many players are even claiming that <em>Silksong</em> is harder than the OG. <a href="https://kotaku.com/hollow-knight-silksong-difficulty-hard-damage-criticism-2000624031">This has led to a lot of discourse on the internet about how hard it is or isn’t, and about game difficulty in general</a>. But if you’re playing on PC, there’s a solution: Just mod <em>Silksong</em> and make it easier.</p> <p><a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/games/hollowknightsilksong?modSort=popular">If we hop over to <em>Silksong’s</em> mods hub over at <em>NexusMods</em></a>, a popular PC modding site, you can see there are already 60+ mods available for the recently released platformer. And many of the most popular mods available for the game make it much easier to play. The most popular mods for <em>Silksong</em> include one that adds health meters to enemies, another one that stops enemies from doing double damage to the player, and one that shows the player’s position on the map at all times. All of these mods have over 15,000 downloads. An automapping mod has 9,000 downloads. Another free PC mod that increases how much damage players deal to enemies has over 7,000 downloads.</p>

 <p>In fact, the only mod more popular than all of these mods that make <em>Silksong</em> easier is the mod needed to run any of these other creations. That mod, “BepInEx 5 with Configuration Manager,” has over 28,000 downloads as of September 8. That’s a lot of downloads for a game that’s barely been out a week. Of course, not all the mods for <em>Silksong</em> are about making it easier. But those mods, like one that adds ultrawide support and a death counter, only have a few hundred downloads or fewer.</p> <p>It seems that the people coming to <em>NexusMods</em> for <em>Silksong</em> mods mostly have one goal in mind: Make the game less challenging. I expect reactions to this will vary a lot, but personally, I land on the side of “If folks want to make a game easier or harder with mods, and it doesn’t ruin it for other people, then whatever.” But I’ve been on the web long enough to know that ain’t a universal take.</p>

              <p>Best Buy is liquidating its warehouse with a big clearance sale on an oddball assortment of <a href="https://kotaku.com/ps5-limited-run-physical-digital-capcom-1851602842">Xbox, PlayStation, and Switch physical games</a>. However, to find deals worth potentially grabbing, you’ll have to dig through some gunk and a lot of sports games from a year ago to find some good games worth adding to your collection.</p> <p><a href="https://x.com/Wario64/status/1964929126176866311">As spotted by the internet’s favorite deals guru, Wario64,</a> Best Buy is currently holding <a href="https://www.bestbuy.com/site/searchpage.jsp?browsedCategory=pcmcat1487698928729&amp;id=pcat17071&amp;loc=1719813&amp;qp=currentoffers_facet%3DCurrent+Deals%7EClearance%5Esoldout_facet%3DAvailability%7EExclude+Out+of+Stock+Items&amp;ref=388&amp;sp=Price-Low-To-High&amp;st=categoryid%24pcmcat1487698928729">a large video game clearance sale online and in stores</a> around the country. Is this more evidence that Best Buy, like other retailers, <a href="https://kotaku.com/best-buy-dvd-blu-ray-games-sales-stop-2024-1851136668">is looking to exit the physical video game space</a> and just fill stores up with more cellphones, old Funko Pops, and fridges? Perhaps, but regardless of why these games are on sale, they are cheaper than normal, and you get a physical copy, too. You can add these to your library or even pass down a copy of <em>Watch Dogs Legion</em> or <em>Diablo IV</em> to your grandkids.</p> <p>Anyway, we dug through the junk to find some of the best games and biggest deals currently available via the Best Buy clearance sale. Keep in mind these might sell out at any time so this list might be out of date by the time you see it. Also, many games are only on sale on a specific platform, which we have listed below next to the usual price and the new sale price.</p> <ul> <li><em>Watch Dogs Legion</em> – Xbox – $8 ($15)</li> <li><em>Tiny Tina’s Wonderlands Next Level Edition</em> – Xbox – $10 ($20)</li> <li><em>Redfall</em> – Xbox – $10 ($70)</li> <li><em>Dragon Ball Xenoverse 2</em> – Xbox – $10 ($20)</li> <li><em>Midnight Suns Enhanced Edition</em> – Xbox – $12 ($20)</li> <li><em>Deathloop</em> – PS5 – $13 ($60)</li> <li><em>Sponge SquarePants A Patrick Star Game</em> – $16 ($20)</li> <li><em>Hot Wheels Unleashed 2: Turbocharged</em> – Xbox – $18 ($30)</li> <li><em>Rainbow Six Siege</em> – PS4 – $18 ($30)</li> <li><em>Diablo IV</em> – PS5 – $25 ($70)</li> <li><em>Core Keeper</em> – PS4 – $18 ($30)</li> <li><em>The Smurfs Village Party</em> – PS5 – $21 ($40)</li> <li><em>Super Bomberman R 2</em> – PS5 – $24 ($30)</li> <li><em>Samba de Amigo: Party Central</em> – Switch – $24 ($40)</li> <li><em>Dragon’s Dogma 2</em> – Xbox – $26 ($50)</li> <li><em>Crisis Core: Final Fantasy VII: Reunion</em> – Xbox – $30 ($50)</li> <li><em>NFS Unbound</em> – Xbox – $30 ($50)</li> <li><em>Neon White</em> – PS5 – $32 ($40)</li> <li><em>Test Drive Unlimited Solar Crown</em> – Xbox – $31 ($70)</li> </ul> <p>And yeah, <em>Redfall</em> wasn’t a great game, <a href="https://kotaku.com/xbox-game-pass-redfall-offline-update-4-arkane-austin-1851484821">but it got an offline mode not that long ago</a> and is easily worth $10 if you are hankering for a vampire-themed RPG shooter this Halloween season.</p>
