              <p>Merry Christmas! But sorry, I think you must have been bad because all I have to offer you is this new Walmart commercial starring <a href="https://kotaku.com/fallout-season-2-news-goggins-wrapped-done-filming-2026-1851779855">Walton Goggins, aka the Ghoul from Amazon’s<em> Fallout</em> series</a>, in a crass attempt to cash in on millennial nostalgia for that Jim Carrey Grinch movie.</p> <p>Yup, Walton Goggins took what I assume was a sizeable paycheck to star in a new, very expensive-looking Walmart ad that is clearly inspired by Dr. Seuss’ holiday classic <em>How The Grinch Stole</em> Christmas, and more specifically by the 2000 film adaptation starring Jim Carrey. (Nobody tell Amazon that Goggins is in a Walmart ad!) Goggins not only looks like Carrey’s Grinch, but even (mostly) does a solid impersonation of the comedian’s famous portrayal of the Christmas-hating monster. Here’s the ad:</p>

  <p>It’s better than the animated movie starring Benedict Cumberbatch,that you likely forgot even got made, but come on, Goggins. How much money do you need? Really,&nbsp;I can spot you a fifty if that helps you avoid shit like this.</p> <p>As I’ve said before, <a href="https://kotaku.com/super-bowl-59-best-ads-celebs-ford-keoghan-selling-out-1851759498">we really need to once again start bullying celebrities and actors who do TV commercials</a>. Selling out isn’t cool, kids. <a href="https://youtu.be/dS5N8EAOtVE">Back in my day, you’d go to Japan and do ads there</a> to hide the fact you were a sellout. And in fact, you get put on the naughty list for doing it.&nbsp; True story, I asked Santa Claus and he confirmed it to me. He also said being a games journalist gets you on the naughty list, too, and then complained that my<a href="https://kotaku.com/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-review-campaign-is-it-good-zombies-multiplayer-2000645198"> <em>Black Ops 7</em> review</a> was too harsh and slammed the door in my face. Anyway, this commercial is gross! Bah, humbug, I say!</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Microsoft’s push to make Windows 11 a fully AI PC operating system continues, with the company planning to roll out new AI agents that can complete tasks and make changes on your behalf. But the company isn’t turning the AI feature on by default because there’s a risk of it downloading and installing malware. Oops!</p> <p><a href="https://www.windowscentral.com/microsoft/windows-11/microsoft-warns-security-risks-agentic-os-windows-11-xpia-malware">As spotted by <em>Windows Central</em></a><em>, </em>Microsoft recently published a lengthy warning about the AI agents it will soon add to Windows 11. In the post, Microsoft explains that agents will have their own accounts on your Windows 11 PC. They’ll also have “limited access to your user profile directory” and, if needed, will be granted read and write access to certain folders, including Documents, Downloads, and Desktop. And while Microsoft claims that all AI decisions must be approved by a human and all actions will be logged and reported, the tech giant acknowledges that activating these agents could be a bad idea.</p>

 <p><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/experimental-agentic-features-a25ede8a-e4c2-4841-85a8-44839191dfb3">In the warning,</a> Microsoft straight up says that its AI agents introduce “novel security risks” like, oh, I don’t know, being able to send off your data without you realizing it, being tricked by online commands, or even installing harmful software. Here’s the full warning:</p> <blockquote><p>As these capabilities are introduced, AI models still face functional limitations in terms of how they behave and occasionally may hallucinate and produce unexpected outputs. Additionally, agentic AI applications introduce novel security risks, such as cross-prompt injection (XPIA), where malicious content embedded in UI elements or documents can override agent instructions, leading to unintended actions like data exfiltration or malware installation.</p></blockquote> <p>Now that seems very bad to me, a person who likes to keep malware off my PC. And Microsoft agrees, because when these agents are added in a future update, they will need to be manually activated by the user. So at the very least, if you are running Windows 11, you don’t have to worry about AI agents installing some malware on your PC while you’re off grabbing a snack. For now. Microsoft is pushing AI hard in all its products, including Xbox, and I wouldn’t be surprised if one day these AI agents in Windows 11 are just turned on by default. Anyway, remember how Xbox is teasing that its next console will <a href="https://www.polygon.com/xbox/607616/microsoft-amd-next-gen-xbox-pc/">basically be a Windows-powered PC?</a>&nbsp;Cool stuff. So happy about that.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>A bus load of Homer Simpsons appeared with little warning in Southern California earlier today. And it’s all part of an elaborate marketing stunt to promote the newest update to the ongoing <a href="https://kotaku.com/fortnite-simpsons-mini-season-springfield-update-leak-november-2000637296"><em>Fortnite x Simpsons</em> season</a>.</p> <p>Earlier this month, after plenty of teasing and leaks, <a href="https://kotaku.com/fortnite-simpsons-mini-season-review-changes-new-map-short-2000640868">Epic released a massive update for <em>Fortnite</em></a> that changed the game into a big ol’ <em>Simpsons</em> crossover, complete with a new island that is modeled after the long-running animated show’s Springfield. The season has been a big hit for Epic, and each week in November, Epic and Disney (the owners of <em>The Simpsons</em>) have published new animated <em>Simpsons</em> short telling a story of what happens when <a href="https://kotaku.com/fortnite-simpsons-house-layout-mystery-rumpus-room-secret-new-areas-2000641142"><em>Fortnite</em> collides with the longest-running sitcom in history</a>. And the season’s next update involves a lot of Homers, with some of them spilling into our reality.</p> <p>On November 18,&nbsp; a few dozen people wearing Homer Simpson costumes invaded the Promenade in Santa Monica, California. You can see what that looks like in the video uploaded by Santa Monica Closeup on YouTube earlier today. You’ll also spot a Peely-fied version of Professor Frink, too. This new <em>Fortnite</em> season is weird.</p>

  <p><a href="https://x.com/DiscussingFilm/status/1990733727857582299">As reported by<em> Discussing Film</em> on Twitter,</a> the horde of Homers was also spotted at a donut shop in the area, where they then proceeded to take it over and cause chaos. I assume the owners gave permission and were paid, but imagine being a random person walking in there for some coffee and a glazed donut and running face-first into 12 Homer mascots ripping the place apart.</p> <p>The cloned Homers are part of the next update for <em>Fortnite</em>, as seen in the short below, and will start appearing in the game on November 19. And Epic, please stop adding character skins based on <em>Simpsons</em> characters. I only have so much money.</p>

              <p><span>When the Nintendo Switch 2 launched this summer, a cheaper, Japanese-only version of the console was made available domestically. Some speculated the more affordable console (which cost around $340 compared to the multi-language Switch 2’s $480) was offered to address a weak yen or the cost of living in Japan, but whatever the reason, it helped: the Switch 2 was Japan’s biggest ever console launch, according <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/switch-2-is-by-far-japans-biggest-ever-console-launch-likely-clearing-1-million-units/">to <em>VGC</em></a></span><i><span>.&nbsp;</span></i></p> <p><span>In June, the other Japanese gaming behemoth, Sony, said it was keeping an eye on the Switch 2 in terms of competition, but wasn’t all that concerned because of the PlayStation 5’s “differentiated strategy,” </span><a href="https://www.polygon.com/playstation/606826/sony-ps5-vs-switch-2-sales/"><span>as reported by </span><i><span>Polygon</span></i></a><span>. Sony Interactive Entertainment president and CEO Hideaki Nishini said that the PlayStation 5 was “the best place of play.”&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><span>“We believe PS5’s level of performance is required to achieve a great experience on big screens. And in this way, we have provided a unique offering to players and creators in this current console generation,” Nishino said.&nbsp;</span></p>  <p><span>But over the last few weeks, Sony has displayed a renewed interest in its Japanese market, holding a </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/playstation-state-of-play-japan-marvel-dragon-quest-2000643049"><span>Japan-centric State of Play on November 11</span></a><span> that focused on games developed in the region, and also </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/sony-announces-cheaper-ps5-thats-only-for-japan-2000643085"><span>announced a cheaper PS5 that</span></a><span>, similar to the Switch 2, is only for use in Japan. It’s the first region-locked console Sony has released since the PlayStation 2, and a new report suggests this maneuver may be because Sony is finally considering Nintendo a proper competitor.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><span>According to a report from </span><a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/news/2025/11/playstation-ceo-pushed-through-cut-price-ps5-in-japan-after-seeing-system-slump-against-switch-2"><i><span>Push Square</span></i></a><span> (based on a translation from </span><a href="https://www.installbaseforum.com/forums/threads/media-create-sales-week-45-2025-nov-03-nov-09.4147/page-7#post-367685"><span>Install Base user Hartmann</span></a><span>, which lines up with machine translation of the segment), Japanese media outlet </span><a href="https://txbiz.tv-tokyo.co.jp/original2/vod/post_329817"><i><span>TV Tokyo</span></i></a><span> discussed the price drop with local experts, who suggested that Sony wasn’t bothered by PlayStation’s shrinking market in Japan until hearing of Nintendo’s cheaper Switch 2. According to the </span><i><span>TV Tokyo </span></i><span>segment, Sony executives decided to ape Nintendo’s approach, and allegedly approved the PS5 price cut in just four months.</span></p> <p><span> The reporters also suggest that Sony president Nishino, who stepped into the role this past April after taking over for Dutch-born Hermen Hulst, felt so strongly about PlayStation’s flagging brand in Japan (Nishino is Japanese) that he helped push the region-specific console to market.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>The Japanese-only digital version of the PS5 goes on sale on November 21.&nbsp;</span></p>
