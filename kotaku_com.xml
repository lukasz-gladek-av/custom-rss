Midjourney’s conduct misappropriates Disney’s and Universal’s intellectual property and threatens to upend the bedrock incentives of U.S. copyright law that drive American leadership in movies, television, and other creative arts.” </p><p>This is the highest-profile legal attack yet on a generative-AI company, following lawsuits by <em>The New York Times</em> and others against companies like OpenAI for copying written work. The outcome in court would have major consequences for the viability of a technology that companies like Microsoft, Google, and Meta are investing billions in. Without the ability to essentially copy the internet for free, the entire business model behind a lot of generative-AI and large language algorithms falls part. </p><p> “Midjourney’s bootlegging business model and defiance of U.S copyright law<br>are not only an attack on Disney, Universal, and the hard-working creative community that brings the magic of movies to life, but are also a broader threat to the American motion picture industry which has created millions of jobs and contributed more than $260 billion to the nation’s economy,” the companies claim in their lawsuit. “This case is not a ‘close call’ under well-settled copyright law.”   </p><p>  .</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Since you can directly control your character using WASD, you can control the vehicle’s path and ram into a secondary Zoi.</p><p>However, and once again, this only works for the Zois under your care.

Okay, so the last one isn’t precisely an accident. But you can continue using old, broken appliances that may lead to a kitchen incident, and if your Zoi doesn’t move away quickly enough (such as when you turn off autonomy), they’ll likely perish in the blaze.</p><h2 id="h689687"><a id="2"></a>All the ways a Zoi can die in <em>inZoi</em></h2><figure id="" data-id="ad19b874780467494a93aa74d374b076" data-recommend-id="image://ad19b874780467494a93aa74d374b076" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="An in-game guide overview of fire hazards in inZOI." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="An in-game guide overview of fire hazards in inZOI." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="false" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Krafton</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="ad19b874780467494a93aa74d374b076" data-recommend-id="image://ad19b874780467494a93aa74d374b076" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="An in-game guide overview of fire hazards in inZOI." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>There are several currently available ways in which a Zoi may perish, including:</p><p><strong>Car accidents</strong></p><ul data-type="List" data-style="Bullet"><li>Should another Zoi ram your current Zoi with their vehicle, either in a car accident or a pedestrian accident, it may lead to an untimely death.</li></ul><p><strong>Fire</strong></p><ul data-type="List" data-style="Bullet"><li>Due to an accident or a busted appliance, a fire can break out in a kitchen and lead to severe injury or death.</li></ul><p><strong>Fall damage</strong></p><ul data-type="List" data-style="Bullet"><li>Should your Zoi slip on a wet surface, the ensuing fall may lead to death.</li></ul><p><strong>Starvation</strong></p><ul data-type="List" data-style="Bullet"><li>Ignoring your Zoi’s needs, specifically their hunger, can lead to starvation over time.</li></ul><p><strong>Sleep deprivation</strong></p><ul data-type="List" data-style="Bullet"><li>Once again, ignoring a need and refusing to allow your Zoi to sleep will lead to sleep deprivation and, in time, death.</li></ul><p><strong>Electrocution</strong></p><ul data-type="List" data-style="Bullet"><li>In the same way as a fire may break out, using a broken appliance or attempting to hack into an ATM may lead to electrocution.</li></ul><p><strong>Old age</strong></p><ul data-type="List" data-style="Bullet"><li>Zois will pass away due to old age, though the age in question varies between characters.</li></ul><p><em>inZOI </em>is available now on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and Windows PC.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

How could I hate on such a precious, friendly little Koopa as he? But you don’t have to play <em>Mario Kart World</em> for long to realize somebody must have pissed in his Cheerios this time around—he is more aggressive than ever, hauling players back onto the race track whenever they put the slightest toe out of line. </p><p>Ram into a barrier along the side of a course? Bam, you’re getting Lakitu’d. Try to cut corners and drive through an open field? There’s a 50/50 chance he’ll be on your ass before you even realize you’re not allowed to go that way. Want to relive that classic shortcut from Mario Circuit 4 dating back to the days of the SNES by hopping that green barrier at the second-to-last bend before the finish line? Get fucked. </p><p>I thought I was alone, but nope, Lakitu is ruining everyone else’s fun too. It’s ironic too, considering <em>Mario Kart World </em>features the series’ most complex and open courses yet, each existing on a full map in which you can drive between the tracks. For a sequel where exploring off the beaten path and grinding on every surface you can find is core to its ethos, <em>Mario Kart World</em> really doesn’t want you living your best, improvised life a lot of the time. It’s especially annoying since Lakitu takes your items and an extra <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/mario-kart-world-coin-farming-tips-vehicles-unlock-1851784093&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/mario-kart-world-coin-farming-tips-vehicles-unlock-1851784093">three coins every time he grabs you</a></span>. </p><p> “Lakitu is a bastard in this game,” wrote SkeletronDOTA on the subreddit. “One time I just drifted slightly wide with a golden shroom and he put me back on the track, and took my golden shroom and bullet with him.” User Chrop responded, “Lakitu seems extremely strict in this game, was playing on Boo Cinema and I flew slightly to the right on the glider section and said no. I was fully able to get back on the track but he didn’t like that I flew a little too far away.”</p><p>It’s not all bad. Lakitu won’t mess with you in Free Roam mode where you can complete the Mario Circuit feather jump shortcut in peace, and there are definitely times where his quick interventions are appreciated. For instance, say, if you <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/mariokart/comments/1l7f75b/uhh_excuse_me/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/mariokart/comments/1l7f75b/uhh_excuse_me/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">start randomly falling</a></span> through the map.

Still, he could use way more overall chill. Maybe <em>Mario Kart World</em>’s next patch will dial him back a bit. For now, Lakitu is way overtuned. </p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
