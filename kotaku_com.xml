            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Good morning! I’m in a bad mood today. Don’t talk to me. Yeah, whatever, welcome to Morning Checkpoint, <em>Kotaku</em>‘s daily round-up of news and other stuff you might care about.&nbsp; Just read this post about the <em>Witcher</em> author being upset about the games changing his lore and some other stuff, and then leave me alone. I’m going back to my room. Don’t bug me.</p> <h2><strong>How Much Would You Pay For An Atari-Shaped Cheeto?</strong></h2> <p>Over on eBay, a person is trying to auction off a Cheeto they claim to have found in a bag that kind of looks like the Atari logo. <a href="https://www.ebay.com/itm/286850038931?mkcid=16&amp;mkevt=1&amp;mkrid=711-127632-2357-0&amp;ssspo=c-3F8w9eS6u&amp;sssrc=2524149&amp;ssuid=c-3F8w9eS6u&amp;stype=1&amp;widget_ver=artemis&amp;media=COPY">The seller is also offering the Cheeto for the buy-now price of $10,000</a>. “What can I say? It’s the ultimate showpiece for the ultimate Atari fan,” is how the seller describes this item on the website. They then explain “in all seriousness” that some “weird stuff” is happening in their life right now, and extra money would be a “huge blessing to me and my family.”</p>

 <p dir="ltr">The seller also claims that they have been a part of the Atari homebrew community for a while now and even published and co-designed a few games. Oh, and they were also a professional wrestler. Wild stuff. All of this might explain why they add in that, if requested, they’ll even sign the Atari-shaped Cheeto piece, too.&nbsp; “Happy bidding,” is how the seller ends the Cheeto’s listing. Nobody has placed a bid as of 9:30 a.m. EST on October 1.</p>

 <h2><strong>There Aren’t Actually Multiple Witcher Schools, Says Creator Of The Series</strong></h2> <p>You know how in the Witcher games there are multiple “Witcher Schools”? Geralt, for example, is from the School of the Wolf. And the <em>Witcher 4</em> teaser included a look at the medallion for the School of the Lynx. There are others, too, in the universe of the games. But according to the author behind the OG <em>Witcher</em> books, Andrzej Sapkowski, all of that is hogwash based on a single sentence that shouldn’t have been included at all.</p>

 <p>“A single sentence about some ‘school of the Wolf’ mysteriously made its way into <em>The Last Wish,</em>” <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/rpg/the-witcher-author-andrzej-sapkowski-says-one-of-cd-projekts-big-story-points-is-actually-based-on-a-mistake-but-videogame-people-have-clung-to-the-idea-with-remarkable-tenacity/">Sapkowski explained in a Reddit AMA spotted by <em>PC Gamer.</em></a> “I later deemed it unworthy of development and narratively incorrect, even detrimental to the plot. Therefore, later, I never included or referenced any Witcher Gryffindors or Slytherins again. Never. However, that one sentence was enough. Adaptors, particularly videogame people, have clung to the idea with remarkable tenacity and have wonderfully multiplied these ‘witcher schools.’ Completely unnecessary.”</p>

 <p>As for what happens now, Sapkowski says he might expand on the concept in future stories, or he might just have his publisher remove the sentence from future copies of the book. Either way, it’s safe to say the games are doing their own thing compared to the books, which is fine. Adaptations don’t need to be carbon copies of the original work to be worthwhile.</p>

 <h2><strong>We’ll Learn More About The Future Of <em>Halo</em> Later This Month</strong></h2> <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/halo-wc-october-remake-remaster-news-trailer-rumor-xbox-1851785384">Last October,</a> Halo Studios (formerly 343 Industries) and Xbox unveiled the first look at the future of <em>Halo</em> games during the franchise’s annual esports tournament, the Halo World Cup aka Halo WC. Well, after teasing it earlier this year, Xbox has confirmed one again that they’ll have more to share about the future of <em>Halo</em>, which is likely to be built in Unreal Engine, at this year’s upcoming Halo WC.</p>

 <p>“Like last year, we’ll be on the Main Stage to talk about it, but this year we’ve also got a deep dive panel planned for the Community Stage that you won’t want to miss,” explained Halo <a href="https://www.halowaypoint.com/news/halowc2025">eSports lead Tashi on the official <em>Halo</em> website.</a> We’ll likely get a new trailer and maybe even some early gameplay footage of the next <em>Halo</em> game. The Halo WC takes place from October 24 to October 26.</p> <h2><strong><em>Prototype</em> Might Be Getting A Remaster Or Something</strong></h2> <p>Remember <em>Prototype</em>, that open-world anti-superhero action game from Activision released back in the Xbox 360 era? Probably not, but if you do remember it and were wondering what’s up with <em>Prototype</em>, well, dataminers have dug up evidence that the game might be getting a full remaster or at least a cleaned-up re-release of sorts over 15 years after launch.&nbsp; <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/prototype-remaster-may-be-on-the-way-after-new-credits-were-quietly-added-to-the-steam-version">As reported by <em>IGN</em></a>, the game has received numerous behind-the-scenes updates on Steam, and it looks like Iron Galaxy, a studio known for remastering games, is now included in the game’s credits. Interesting stuff…for people who miss <em>Prototype</em>.</p> <h2><strong>ICYMI:&nbsp;</strong></h2> <ul> <li><a href="https://kotaku.com/street-fighter-6-capcom-cup-12-ppv-ticket-price-2000630340">Capcom wants to lock <em>SF6</em> finals behind a paywall</a></li> <li><a href="https://kotaku.com/call-of-duty-beta-cheaters-cod-blops-black-ops-7-ban-secure-boot-ricochet-2000630268"><em>Black Ops 7</em> wants cheaters to come cheat in the beta</a></li> <li><a href="https://kotaku.com/overwatch-2-skin-contest-china-junkrat-furry-diaper-2000630263"><em>Overwatch 2</em> fans want a Junkrat skin that puts him in a diaper</a></li> </ul> <h2>Watch This:</h2>

              <p>Microsoft is adding a bunch of games to Xbox Game Pass to make Wednesday’s <a href="https://kotaku.com/xbox-game-pass-gets-massive-price-hike-yet-amid-big-changes-2000630604">massive price hike announcement sting a little less</a>.<em> Hogwarts Legacy</em> is the big one being added to all tiers of the program. Of the more than 80 games joining across different tiers, many are Ubisoft Classics, including <em>Assassins Creed: Black Flag</em> and<em> Far Cry 3</em>. A ton are also PC-only games, so if you&nbsp;<em>only</em> own an Xbox Series X/S, I’m not sure what exactly you’re supposed to do with those. Some of them will run on anything, like the original <em>Fallout</em>. Others, like the hit medieval settlement sim <em>Manor Lords</em>, will not.</p> <p>Here’s the complete list of every game added to Game Pass on October 1, 2025:</p> <h3><strong>Ultimate – Available
