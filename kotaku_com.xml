              <p>Raphaël “Jeanpormanove” Graven reportedly died in his sleep earlier this week following broadcasts <a href="https://kotaku.com/nickmercs-kick-twitch-faze-clan-gambling-1850973704">on Kick</a> where he was routinely assaulted by others in controversial “humiliation” livestreams. <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c1mpjplk4pxo">According to the BBC</a>, a judicial investigation in France is underway, with French government minister for digital technologies Clara Chappaz calling what Graven experienced “absolute horror.”</p> <p>The death of the 46-year-old, whose <a href="https://www.charentelibre.fr/france/qui-etait-jean-pormanove-l-influenceur-decede-en-live-25595669.php">streaming career began with TikTok videos about <em>GTA 5 </em>and <em>FIFA</em></a> and who had amassed over a million followers across all his channels, appears to have been captured live during his latest, and last, marathon Kick broadcast. Graven’s more recent content, which he created as part of the collective Le LokalTV, included being seemingly brutalized by two fellow streamers who go by the aliases <span dir="auto">“Naruto”</span><span dir="auto">&nbsp;and&nbsp;</span><span dir="auto">“Safine,” with some clips appearing to show violent, prolonged strangulations. </span>An <a href="https://www.mediapart.fr/journal/france/080125/maltraitances-sur-kick-deux-influenceurs-nicois-places-en-garde-vue">investigation last year by<em> Mediapart</em></a> alleged that Graven had been subject to “months of online abuse.”</p> <p>It’s unclear what exactly the relationship was between all of the men, though reporting by <em>Mediapart</em> suggests the “humiliation” streams were lucrative and helped propel the popularity of Graven and the group’s channel on Kick. Naruto and Safine were reportedly taken into custody earlier this year but were later released amid an ongoing investigation. Kick also temporarily suspended the channel but it later resumed streaming again. Clips of the alleged abuse can be found <a href="https://twitter.com/ImpactMediaFR/status/1957522649879302450?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1957522649879302450%7Ctwgr%5E96e20f49e42b8d663ca62bac84c30551c2664a5b%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.dexerto.com%2Fkick%2Ffrench-streamer-jean-pormanove-dies-in-his-sleep-age-46-3239700%2F">circulating online</a>.</p>

 <p><a href="https://www.mediapart.fr/journal/france/180825/victime-de-maltraitance-en-ligne-depuis-des-mois-le-streamer-jean-pormanove-meurt-en-direct"><em>Mediapart</em> now reports</a> that viewers of the stream earlier this week on Discord became worried about Graven’s condition after he appeared to being laying motionless in his sleep for an extended period of time. According to <em>the AFP</em>, an autopsy to determine the cause of death has been ordered.</p> <p>Kick is a competitor to Twitch and YouTube known for its loose guidelines and minimal moderation. Streamers there can promote gambling and other topics that are prohibited on other streaming platforms. A representative for Kick told the BBC it was “urgently reviewing” the circumstances around Graven’s apparent death on camera. “We are deeply saddened by the loss of Jeanpormanove and extend our condolences to his family, friends and community,” they said.</p>

              <p><em>Denshattack!</em> was probably the coolest game revealed during <a href="https://kotaku.com/gamescom-onl-2025-resident-evil-silent-hill-silksong-2000618460">today’s very long Gamescom Opening Night Live event</a>. But funnily enough, the wild-looking, trick-based anime train game wasn’t actually revealed during the trailer-packed event. Instead, it debuted during ONL’s shockingly good pre-show. And I can’t wait to play it when it launches next year.</p> <p><em>Denshattack!’s </em>vibrant colors and eye-popping art immediately caught the attention of everyone at <em>Kotaku</em> and reminded me of <em>Jet Set Radio</em> or even Insomniac’s <em>Sunset Overdrive</em>. And then, we all saw a train do some flips and grinds, and suddenly it became clear that <em>Denshattack!</em>&nbsp;is like a<em> Tony Hawk</em> game, but instead of controlling a person on a skateboard, you control a customizable subway car that can flip, jump, grind, hop, spin, and more across some truly gorgeous scenery. Just watch this trailer and try not to smile.</p> <p><iframe loading="lazy" title="Denshattack! - Reveal Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="about:blank" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen="" data-rocket-lazyload="fitvidscompatible" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/o_Xmv9eAIZA?feature=oembed"></iframe></p> <p>Here’s how the game’s developers, Undercoders, describe <em>Denshattack!:&nbsp;</em></p>

 <blockquote><p>Flip, trick, and grind your train in a fast-paced, off-the-rails ride through a colorful Japanese dystopia. Outmatch rival gangs, wreck a shady megacorp, and take back the tracks with nothing but skill, speed, and style. Hop aboard your custom gravity-defying train and embark on a hectic quest to defeat the sinister Miraido corporation, alongside a vibrant pack of outcasts.</p></blockquote> <p>According to the game’s trailer on YouTube, <em>Denshattack!</em> contains over 50 levels to complete, a full combo system, and “slick beats” from composer Tee Lopes, who helped create the music for games like <em>Sonic Mania </em>and <em>TMNT: Shredder’s Revenge.&nbsp;</em>It also features “bizarre boss fights” and multiple regions of Japan to discover and explore while doing sick flips as a big train. This is definitely one of those video game concepts, <a href="https://kotaku.com/shark-dentist-horror-game-deadly-great-white-steam-pc-1851786072">like doing dental work on a shark</a>, that I never thought about, but now that I’ve seen it, I must play it as soon as possible.</p> <p><em>Denshattack!&nbsp;</em>doesn’t have a specific release date yet, but is set to launch in Spring 2026. <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2524850/Denshattack/">You can wishlist the game now on Steam.</a></p>
