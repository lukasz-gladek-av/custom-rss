Impressive stuff! What’s not so impressive is a moment in the movie in which Hugh Grant’s character does a brief impersonation of Jar-Jar Binks. </p><p>On November 12, <em>IGN </em>posted a clip from Heretic showing Grant’s character talking about how, in the future, people will worship Jar-Jar Binks as a religious figure. The clip was later “borrowed” and <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://x.com/discussingfilm/status/1856757930714173477?s=46&amp;t=ELmQU9gVKk7kgACkfTFs1Q&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://x.com/discussingfilm/status/1856757930714173477?s=46&amp;t=ELmQU9gVKk7kgACkfTFs1Q" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">reposted by DiscussingFilm</a></span> on Twitter, where it blew up.</p><p>Jar-Jar first appeared in <em>Star Wars Episode I: The Phantom Menace</em> in 1999 and people hated him. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/mandalorian-star-wars-jedi-beq-jarjar-actor-ahmed-best-1850257681?_gl=1*1n90v1m*_ga*MzQzNjkwNDM2LjE2NDY2NjQ1NzQ.*_ga_V4QNJTT5L0*MTczMTUzMTQ0Ni4xMTIuMC4xNzMxNTMxNDQ4LjU4LjAuMA..&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/mandalorian-star-wars-jedi-beq-jarjar-actor-ahmed-best-1850257681?_gl=1*1n90v1m*_ga*MzQzNjkwNDM2LjE2NDY2NjQ1NzQ.*_ga_V4QNJTT5L0*MTczMTUzMTQ0Ni4xMTIuMC4xNzMxNTMxNDQ4LjU4LjAuMA..">The negative reaction and abuse pushed Jar-Jar’s actor, Ahmed Best, to nearly kill himself</a></span>.

So I’m going to assume that the horrible impersonation is on purpose and is an example of how the character doesn’t know much about who Jar-Jar is, which might be a clue toward how much you can trust him. </p><p>Or maybe Grant did it, everyone on set was silent, he took that as a sign of success and moved on, and nobody had the heart to say it was bad. Either way, I’d pay money to see Grant impersonate more <em>Star Wars </em>characters. Give me your best Jabba or Yoda, my dude. </p><p><em>Heretic</em> is out now in theaters. Don’t boo the screen when his Jar-Jar impersonation happens. Okay? </p><p> .<br></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

In the morning, when I’m opening my packs and battling for Laprases while my coffee cools, it helps the mobile card game’s beautiful creature art pop amid the window glare. When I’m trying to sneak a session in while mixing formula or rocking a baby back to sleep, however, having <em>Pokémon TCG Pocket</em> open is like shooting a phosphorus flare directly into my eyeballs.

It looks like every other dark mode app on my phone. I need it now. </p><p>There are a couple of reasons the status quo in <em>Pokémon TCG Pocket</em> is particularly bad. First, there is just a ton of white space in this game. Loading animations and default backgrounds all look like they’re made out of pearl. The result is like facing an oncoming car with nauseatingly bright LED high beams that never actually drives past. Second, because of all this light being output, <em>Pokémon TCG Pocket</em> absolutely destroys my phone’s battery life. A five-minute match ticks multiple percentage points off my meter. Before I know it, the whole thing is shutting down just as <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/pokemon-tcg-pocket-best-decks-mewtwo-charizard-1851696181?_gl=1*6cqpk0*_ga*MzQzNjkwNDM2LjE2NDY2NjQ1NzQ.*_ga_V4QNJTT5L0*MTczMTUyMTM4Ni4xMTEuMS4xNzMxNTI2MjM5LjQxLjAuMA..&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-tcg-pocket-best-decks-mewtwo-charizard-1851696181?_gl=1*6cqpk0*_ga*MzQzNjkwNDM2LjE2NDY2NjQ1NzQ.*_ga_V4QNJTT5L0*MTczMTUyMTM4Ni4xMTEuMS4xNzMxNTI2MjM5LjQxLjAuMA..">my Charizard</a></span> has hit four energy. </p><p>  <em>Pokémon TCG Pocket</em> needs a lot of things at the moment. Card trading for one, a feature that is missing but listed as coming soon. Also emotes, or any other way of communicating with opponents during matches. How else can I troll people when they make a mistake or their turn-one Misty immediately flips a tails? But more than any of those things, <em>Pokémon TCG Pocket </em>needs a dark mode. I let my premium pass free trial lapse today. If it came with a dark mode, I can promise you I would have re-upped. My family’s uninterrupted sleep and my corneas depend on it. </p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
