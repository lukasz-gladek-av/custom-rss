              <p>Matt Firor founded Zenimax Online in 2007 and helped Bethesda shepherd<em> The Elder Scrolls Online</em> into one of the premier MMORPGs out there. He left abruptly last summer when Microsoft laid off dozens at the studio amid a wider bloodbath at the company and canceled the upcoming online multiplayer game he and others were working on, <a href="https://kotaku.com/blackbird-mmorpg-leaks-gta-dan-houser-eso-free-2000615981">Project Blackbird</a>. He recently broke his silence on the reason for his departure, confirming what fans had long suspected.</p> <p>“Project Blackbird was the game I had waited my entire career to create, and having it canceled led to my resignation,” Firor wrote in a January 1 post on <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7412202293737046016/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-analytics-id="inline-link" data-url="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7412202293737046016/" data-hl-processed="none" data-mrf-recirculation="inline-link" data-hawk-tracked="hawklinks" data-mrf-link="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7412202293737046016/">LinkedIn</a>&nbsp;which he later <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/did:plc:sdsbjnwwyzxwz3b4lqtbtwd5/post/3mbeicw5hgw2f?ref_src=embed&amp;ref_url=https%253A%252F%252Fwww.pcgamer.com%252Fgames%252Fmmo%252Fformer-elder-scrolls-online-chief-confirms-microsofts-2025-bloodbath-drove-his-departure-from-zenimax-project-blackbird-was-the-game-i-had-waited-my-entire-career-to-create%252F">shared on Bluesky</a>. “My heart and thoughts are always with the impacted team members, many of whom I had worked 20+ years with, and all of whom were the most dedicated, amazingly talented group of developers in the industry.”</p>   <p>The post never mentions Microsoft directly and doesn’t take aim at the decision makers at Xbox, which acquired Zenimax Online in 2021, but the move clearly left a very bad taste in many veteran developers’ mouths. Some of Firor’s former colleagues went on to form Sackbird Studios to work on their own multiplayer game. “With internal funding and full creative control, the studio is focused on crafting bold, character-driven experiences free from corporate compromises,” they <a href="https://kotaku.com/halo-studios-gta-6-price-fortnite-simpsons-2000633663">wrote last year</a>.</p>

 <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/xbox-layoffs-zenimax-online-blackbird-elder-scrolls-1851785629"><em>Bloomberg</em> reported</a> that Blackbird was an ambitious loot shooter that mixed elements of <em>Destiny</em> and <em>Blade Runner</em> with the structure and questlines of an MMORPG. Microsoft Gaming CEO Phil Spencer reportedly played a build of the game last March and loved what he saw, making its eventual cancelation even more perplexing. The layoffs and cuts came as Xbox game studios were <a href="https://kotaku.com/xbox-microsoft-price-hike-game-pass-layoffs-new-console-2000638546">reportedly tasked</a> with achieving a controversial 30-percent profit margin despite being forced to make all of their games playable for free on Game Pass.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/ps-plus-jan-2026-free-monthly-games-core-keeper-2000656495</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>The first free monthly <a href="https://kotaku.com/ps-plus-december-2025-extra-assassins-creed-jrpg-2000652236">PlayStation Plus games</a> for paying subscribers in 2026 have been revealed and it’s a sleepy month for PS5 and PS4 players. There are also only three additions for this month, compared to last month’s five.</p> <p>On December 31, Sony revealed the <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/12/31/playstation-plus-monthly-games-for-january-need-for-speed-unbound-disney-epic-mickey-rebrushed-core-keeper/">first batch of PS Plus Essential games</a> coming this year and while they’re decent games, none of the picks make a big splash. These games will be available to add to your PlayStation library permanently beginning on January 6. Once added, you can install them and play them whenever you want as long as you are an active PS Plus Essential, Extra, or Premium subscriber. Here’s the list of games and what platforms they are available on:</p> <ul> <li> <p><em>Need For Speed Unbound</em> | PS5</p> </li> <li> <p><em>Disney Epic Mickey: Rebrushed</em> | PS4, PS5</p> </li> <li> <p><em>Core Keeper</em> | PS4, PS5</p> </li> </ul> <p><em>Rebrushed</em> is the 2024 remaster of the 2010 platformer from <em>Deus Ex</em> director Warren Spector. Nice for anyone who didn’t play the original or wants an important lesson in game development history. <em>Unbound</em>, meanwhile, is the 25th installment in the&nbsp;<em>Need for Speed</em> series and features a neat cel-shaded art style. The 2022 release is a fun racer but far from the most memorable in the franchise.</p>

 <p><em>Core Keeper</em> is arguably the best pick-up this month. It’s a top-down pixel art crafting sim that marries <em>Minecraft</em> and <em>Stardew Valley</em>. Like those games it continues to receive meaty free updates, with one coming later this month called Void &amp; Voltage. Not the worst month overall, though not as generous as last month’s <a href="http://PlayStation Plus games">pre-holiday haul</a>.</p>

              <p>2026 is shaping up to be another big year for video games. The next 12 months are set to bring massive sequels like <em>Forza Horizon 6, Resident Evil Requiem,</em> and <em>Gears of War: E-Day.</em> There are also some smaller games we’re excited to get our hands on, like <em>Bubsy 4D, Mouse: P.I. for Hire,</em> and <em>Slay The Spire 2.</em> And of course, there’s<em> Grand Theft Auto 6,</em> which, assuming it doesn’t get delayed again, will close out 2026 with a big, industry-shaking bang.</p> <p>There are so many games to be excited about in 2026 that you might have forgotten about some of them. So we here at <em>Kotaku</em> have created this handy list of 31 games we’re excited to play in the new year. Now, place your bets for how many will actually launch in 2026 and how many will instead be delayed to 2027 or beyond.</p>

 <h2><b><i>Resident Evil Requiem</i></b><b> – Feb. 27</b></h2>  <p><span>I was already excited for a new mainline </span><i><span>Resident Evil</span></i><span> game arriving in early 2026; you didn’t need to add Leon Kennedy. But I’m very grateful. -Zack Zwiezen</span></p>

 <h2><b><i>Lego Batman: Legacy of the Dark Knight </i></b><b>– 2026&nbsp;</b></h2>  <p><span>We ain’t getting a new </span><i><span>Arkham </span></i><span>game anytime soon, so this Lego spin on the formula will have to do. Luckily, it looks rad as heck. – Zack Zwiezen</span></p> <h2><b><i>Forza Horizon 6 </i></b><b>– 2026</b></h2>  <p><span>The follow-up to one of the best Xbox games ever made, and it’s set in a gorgeously dense open-world recreation of Japan. Yup. That’s going to be goooood. – Zack Zwiezen</span></p>

 <h2><b><i>Control Resonant </i></b><b>– 2026</b></h2>  <p><span>Remedy’s 2019 </span><i><span>Control </span></i><span>was a wonderful and creepy paranormal shooter. I’ve desperately wanted a sequel, and that’s finally arriving next year. – Zack Zwiezen</span></p>

 <h2><b><i>Mouse: P.I. for Hire </i></b><b>– March 19</b></h2>  <p><span>Mixing a boomer shooter with classic black-and-white cartoons is an odd choice, but the final product seems awesome, and we don’t have to wait long to play. – Zack Zwiezen</span></p>

 <h2><b><i>007 First Light –</i></b><b> March 26</b></h2>  <p><span>IOI, the people behind </span><i><span>Hitman</span></i><span>, seem like the perfect studio to make a James Bond game. Hopefully, it all comes together in the spring. – Zack Zwiezen</span></p> <h2><b><i>Bubsy 4D</i></b><b> – 2026</b></h2>  <p><span>I didn’t have “Excited for a new <em>Bubsy</em> game” on my bingo card for 2026, but here we are. What can I say? <em>Bubsy 4D</em> looks good. – Zack Zwiezen</span></p>

 <h2><b><i>The Duskbloods</i></b><b> – 2026</b></h2>  <p><span>FromSoftware’s upcoming eight-player online action RPG sounds like a great idea </span><i><span>now</span></i><span>, after </span><i><span>Nightreign </span></i><span>proved to be a huge hit and a great game. Hopefully, the Switch 2 is able to handle it. – Zack Zwiezen</span></p> <h2><b><i>Gears of War: E-Day </i></b><b>– 2026</b></h2>  <p><span>I’m sad that <em>Gears 5</em>’s story isn’t moving forward. Still, it should be fun seeing Marcus and Dom back together in this upcoming prequel to the OG Xbox 360 trilogy. – Zack Zwiezen</span></p> <h2><b><i>Star Wars: Galactic Racer</i></b><b> – 2026</b></h2>  <p><span>So many <em>Star Wars</em> games are RPGs, shooters, or action-adventure experiences. That’s fine, but I’m happy to see someone making a racing game set in my favorite sci-fi universe. – Zack Zwiezen</span></p>

 <h2><strong><em>Marathon</em> – March 2026</strong></h2>  <p>The it’s over/we’re so back graph has been all over the place on this one, but with a series of post-alpha test tweaks, including the addition of proximity chat, I’m once again looking forward to seeing Bungie’s take on the extraction shooter, especially if they can weave as much of the background sci-fi lore into a <em>Destiny</em>-style aspirational end-game as I’m hoping they can. <span>– Ethan Gach</span></p> <h2><b><i>Grand Theft Auto 6</i></b><b> – November 19&nbsp;</b></h2>  <p><span>At this point, I feel like I’ve written so many words about the upcoming</span><i><span> GTA 6 </span></i><span>that I’m not sure what else to say. You know what this game is. You are probably excited for it. Let’s hope Rockstar lands this sucker. – Zack Zwiezen</span></p>

 <h2><b><i>Marvel’s Wolverine</i></b><span> –<strong> 2026</strong></span></h2>  <p><span>Insomniac’s </span><i><span>Spider-Man</span></i><span> games have been joyous open-world treats that feel great to play. So people are understandably excited for the studio’s upcoming </span><i><span>Wolverine </span></i><span>game that looks fun and very, very bloody. – Zack Zwiezen</span></p> <h2><strong><em>Saros</em> – April 30</strong></h2>  <p><em>Returnal</em> will always have a special place in my heart, but I’m looking forward to seeing Housemarque branch off into a more forgiving roguelike arcade shooter structure with a robust metagame progression that gives more players more footholds, which will hopefully see more of them hang on and stick it out for the whole ride. <span>– Ethan Gach</span></p> <h2><strong><em>Mina the Hollower</em> – 2026</strong></h2>  <p>Following a brief delay, I can’t wait to see the <em>Shovel Knight</em> team’s take on <em>Castlevania</em> meets <em>The Legend of Zelda: Link’s Awakening</em>. I’m looking forward to a retro homage that pushes the genres it’s playing with to new heights. <span>– Ethan Gach</span></p>

 <h2><strong><em>Replaced</em> – March 12</strong></h2>   <p>This game looks incredible. Looking at it will be enough. Playing it will hopefully feel extra special. <span>– Ethan Gach</span></p> <h2><em>Forbidden Solitaire&nbsp;</em>– Q1 2026</h2>  <p><i><span>Forbidden Solitaire </span></i><span>is ostensibly about you finding and playing a spooky ‘90s CD-ROM solitaire game—think </span><i><span>The 7th Guest </span></i><span>but, y’know, solitaire—and getting way more than you bargained for. I have no idea what that means in gameplay terms, but I can’t wait to find out. – Carolyn Petit</span></p> <h2><strong><em>The Blood of Dawnwalker</em>&nbsp; – 2026</strong></h2>  <p>Ex-<em>Witcher 3</em> devs make a vampire immersive-sim RPG. Enough said. <span>– Ethan Gach</span></p> <h2><strong><em>Danganronpa 2×2</em> – 2026</strong></h2>  <p><em>Danganronpa 2: Goodbye Despair</em> is getting a fancy remake, but it’s also getting a new “what if” scenario in which different victims and killers manifest in its murder mystery. So hey, even if the new storyline isn’t great, we’ll get to play <em>Danganronpa 2&nbsp;</em>again. – Kenneth Shepard</p>

 <h2><strong><em><i>Pokémon</i> Champions</em> – 2026</strong></h2>  <p><i data-stringify-type="italic">Pokémon Champions&nbsp;</i>is the new competitive platform for the series moving forward, and it’s going to integrate several mechanics, such as Mega Evolution and Z-Moves, into one place, meaning it has the potential to completely transform the competitive space, and free up the main games to no longer be beholden to a particular way of doing things. – Kenneth Shepard</p> <h2><b><i>Mario Tennis Fever</i></b><b> – February 12</b></h2>  <p><span>The world needs more fun tennis games. Thank you, Mario and company, for hearing these calls and showing up so early in 2026 to deliver a game that looks like it’ll be exactly what folks want. – Zack Zwiezen</span></p>

 <h2><b><i>Tomb Raider: Legacy of Atlantis</i></b><b> – 2026</b></h2>  <p><span>Sure, another remake of the first </span><i><span>Tomb Raider game </span></i><span>seems a bit silly. But, hey, it looks great and will hold fans over until 2027’s </span><i><span>Tomb Raider: Catalyst.</span></i><span> – Zack Zwiezen</span></p> <h2><strong><em><i>Pokémon</i> Pokopia</em> – March 5</strong></h2>  <p><em><i>Pokémon</i> Pokopia </em>appears to be Pikachu and friends’ take on an <em>Animal Crossing</em>-style life sim, but it also seems to have a dark, post-apocalyptic setting that might keep it from being as cozy as other games in the genre. Intriguing! – Kenneth Shepard</p>

 <h2><strong><em>Pragmata</em> – April 24</strong></h2>  <p>New AAA franchises are so few and far between, it’s a special treat whenever we get one, especially out of Japan. It’s not 3D <em>Mega Man</em> but it might be the next best thing. <span>– Ethan Gach</span></p> <h2><strong><em>Marvel Tokon Fighting Souls</em> – 2026</strong></h2>  <p>When it comes to anime fighters, you don’t bet against Arc System Works.&nbsp;<em>Marvel Tokon Fighting Souls&nbsp;</em>is a 4v4 fighting game with Earth’s Mightiest Heroes on the roster, and it looks pretty rad. – Kenneth Shepard</p> <h2><strong><em>Scott Pilgrim EX</em> – 2026</strong></h2>  <p>It’s about time we got a new&nbsp;<em>Scott Pilgrim&nbsp;</em>beat em up, and this time, it’s coming with a brand new story by series’ creator Bryan Lee O’Malley set after the events of the <em>Scott Pilgrim Takes Off&nbsp;</em>anime. – Kenneth Shepard</p> <h2><strong><em>Demon Tides</em> – February 19</strong></h2>  <p><em>Demon Tides&nbsp;</em>is a modern-day PS2-style mascot platformer that manages to nail the middle ground between pinpoint precision and free-flowing, fast-paced action that so many others in the genre can’t quite inhabit. – Kenneth Shepard</p>

 <h2><strong><em>Nocturne</em> – June 30</strong></h2>  <p>I had to get at least one rhythm game on this list, and <em>Nocturne</em>, a rhythm RPG inspired by science fantasy games of the ’90s, is basically&nbsp;<em>Guitar Hero</em> meets&nbsp;<em>Final Fantasy</em>. – Kenneth Shepard</p> <h2><strong><em>Slay the Spire 2</em>– March 2026</strong></h2>  <p>I slept on the first <em>Slay the Spire</em> when it initially launched. I will not make that mistake again. With most sequels I want a little bit more than just “bigger and better,” but with <em>Slay the Spire 2</em> that will be more than enough. <span>– Ethan Gach</span></p> <h2><b><i>Halo: Campaign Evolved</i></b><b> –</b><strong> 2026</strong></h2>  <p><span>Like </span><i><span>Tomb Raider</span></i><span>, it’s a bit silly that we are getting yet another remake of the first </span><i><span>Halo</span></i><span>, but this one is coming to PlayStation 5, and I wish I could go back in time and tell 12-year-old Zack that fact. It would blow his dumb pre-teen mind. – Zack Zwiezen</span></p> <h2><b><i>Yoshi and the Mysterious Book –</i></b><strong> 2026</strong></h2>  <p><span>This ain’t the Nintendo platformer I was hoping for in 2026, but it looks cute, and for folks who love the </span><i><span>Yoshi </span></i><span>games, well, here’s another one for you. – Zack Zwiezen</span></p>

              <p><span>Hackers and jailbreakers are god’s strongest soldiers. What do you mean y’all discovered that a PS4 port of </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/star-wars-best-games-ranked-jedi-knight-dark-forces-lis-1848893189"><span>a relatively obscure </span><i><span>Star Wars </span></i><span>game</span></a><span> is the key to hacking the PlayStation 5? Bizarre as it is, that’s apparently the case, and PS5 jailbreakers are now trying to track down the limited number of physical copies of </span><i><span>Star Wars Racer Revenge </span></i><span>to crack the console open, with the price of the game going up significantly since the news broke.</span></p> <p><span>As </span><a href="https://resellcalendar.com/news/news/ps5-jailbreak-star-wars-racer-revenge-reseller/"><i><span>Resell Calendar</span></i></a> <span>outlines, PS5 hackers believe they’ve found a jailbreak for the system’s upcoming 12.00 system update, but the developers behind the jailbreak say you’ll need a physical copy of the 2019 </span><i><span>Racer Revenge</span></i><span> port to pull it off. This isn’t unheard of, as earlier jailbreak methods have required a Blu-ray disc to access the proper exploit, and the </span><i><span>Racer Revenge</span></i><span> port has an issue that allows users to “inject code into the system” and that has gone unpatched since the original 2002 release on PS2.</span></p>

 <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">mast1core based on disc game CUSA03474<br>This was the 12.00 dup exploit that was teased.</p> <p>Will release code after polishing more.</p> <p>Happy new year scene <a href="https://t.co/mskPXHQQ0b">pic.twitter.com/mskPXHQQ0b</a></p> <p>— Gezine (@gezine_dev) <a href="https://twitter.com/gezine_dev/status/2006548152913215847?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 1, 2026</a></p></blockquote>  <p><span>The problem is that </span><i><span>Racer Revenge</span></i><span>‘s PS4 physical edition was released by Limited Run Games way back in 2019, and if you hop over to the </span><a href="https://limitedrungames.com/search?q=star+wars+racer%27s+revenge&amp;options%5Bprefix%5D=last"><span>collector company’s site</span></a><span>, you’ll find that the game is unsurprisingly sold out. So naturally, folks are jumping on resale sites like eBay, where prices </span><a href="https://www.ebay.com/sch/i.html?_nkw=star+wars+racer+revenge&amp;_sacat=0&amp;_from=R40&amp;_trksid=p4624852.m570.l1313"><span>have now skyrocketed to over $200</span></a><span> for a pre-owned copy.&nbsp;</span></p>

In the gap between </span><i><span>Resell Calendar</span></i><span>’s article going up yesterday and our publishing this story, prices for </span><i><span>Racer Revenge </span></i><span>have quadrupled. So, if you’re looking to hack your PS5, you might want to buy one of these copies before the price goes up even higher.</span></p>

            <title><![CDATA[Microsoft Tells Piggies To Stop Calling It AI Slop]]></title>
            <link>https://kotaku.com/microsoft-ai-slop-satya-nadella-2000656473</link>
            <guid>1396096</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Gen AI isn’t going anywhere. In fact, it’s just getting started. That’s what Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella believes. He’d also like you to stop calling everything generated by LLM AI “slop.” People need to “get beyond” that in 2026, the executive who <a href="https://www.gamefile.news/p/satya-nadella-microsoft-xbox-pay">earned $79 million</a> in compensation recently announced.</p> <p>These and other musings were shared on his personal “sn scratchpad” blog in a December 29 post titled “<a href="https://snscratchpad.com/posts/looking-ahead-2026/?v=1">Looking ahead to 2026</a>.” It acknowledges the challenges of people figuring out how to actually use gen AI to do things that are useful, but remains bullish on the underlying technology itself to continue improving at a rate worth investing $100 billion in. Here’s the part that caught everyone’s’ attention, though:</p>

 <blockquote><p>We need to get beyond the arguments of slop vs sophistication and develop a new equilibrium in terms of our ‘theory of the mind’ that accounts for humans being equipped with these new cognitive amplifier tools as we relate to each other. This is the product design question we need to debate and answer.</p></blockquote> <p>I’m not sure what exactly Nadella means by “a new equilibrium in terms of our ‘theory of the mind,'” and perhaps he doesn’t either. Given the executive’s <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/features/2025-05-15/microsoft-ceo-satya-nadella-on-his-ai-efforts-and-openai-partnership">penchant for folding AI use into every facet of his work life</a>, it’s not only possible but actually very likely that some version of Copilot, perhaps even a “rich” multi-agent “scaffold,” was the “bicycle for the mind” that helped him conjure this blog post in the first place. If true, that would be as good a reason as any not to move so quickly beyond the “slop vs. sophistication” distinction.</p>

 <p>But there’s no doubt a deeper philosophical schism that separates people who deploy the term “slop” against AI from those whose future is inextricably bound up in gen AI services becoming widely and eagerly adopted. For Nadella, the difference is one of apparent quality. Like the Turing test which ascribes human-like intelligence to anything that can convincingly manipulate language well enough to trick humans, some think it’s only slop if the slop can’t convince them otherwise. For others, it’s slop, no matter how sophisticated it may be, the second human creativity is interrupted, or even supplemented, by a plagiarism machine.</p>

 <p>In the world of cloud computing and stock prices, where everything is interchangeable and fungible, such distinctions are meaningless, or at the very least, don’t drive quarterly profit growth. But in the world of people, slop in is slop out. Being content to eat from the trough does not transform it into a Michelin Star meal.</p>

              <p>When I <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/cave-time-feeling-safe-in-minecraft">first began playing&nbsp;<em>Minecraft</em> in 2010</a>, I instantly fell in love. In its early, simple form, it was essentially a Lego kit, but one where monsters came out at night. That combination of a freedom to build whatever I wanted, but also the need to find somewhere safe and secure to hide in the dark, was all-consuming for me, and for a while there I wanted to play nothing else. Of course, I drifted away, and over time it’s felt like it’s become someone else’s game, perhaps even the rest of the world’s game. Even as my son has gone through multiple phases of playing, I’ve not found myself motivated to reconnect. That is, until this winter holiday, when he insisted I join him in playing on the <a href="https://store.donutsmp.net/">Donut SMP</a>. And in doing so, I’ve discovered that original love all over again.</p> <p>At some point, for me <em>Minecraft</em> became about something other than digging for ores and building a lovely home. In those very early days (the game wasn’t officially released until November 2011), it was uncomplicated. The scope was infinite, but the approach was basic—again, think Lego. I spent an inordinate amount of time playing it, such that when I started dating my now-wife she was quickly introduced to the obsessive nature of the games player, bemused to learn I’d regularly stay up until 2 or 3 a.m. just to dig for diamonds and then attempt to escape from a cave of spiders. Then, I suppose a combination of burnout and the political misery in which the game became embroiled saw me move on.</p>

 <figure id="attachment_2000656451" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000656451"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000656451">© John Walker / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <h2>Taking things down a Notch</h2> <p>Before that, however, things became even more complicated for me as I got to know its creator, Markus “Notch” Persson. I <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/markus-notch-persson-talks-minecraft">first interviewed Persson in November 2010</a>, when&nbsp;<em>Minecraft</em> had became a hot property through word-of-mouth and downloaded java files. Then, in March 2011 <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/a-day-in-the-life-of-minecraft-creator-mojang">I sort of invited myself over to visit Mojang</a>, the fledgling developer Persson had created to continue the development of the game. A sweet Swedish guy who’d only just moved his business operations out of his mom’s basement, he’d made his first $10 million at this point, and the small team were literally moving into their first office when I arrived. The only exterior sign on the building was a torn sheet of file paper with “MojangAB” scrawled on it in green pen, taped to the inside of the door. Business developer Daniel Kaplan showed me around, at one point announcing, “This is the conference room,” as we entered a completely bare room but for an upturned cardboard box in one corner. “It still needs some work,” he added.</p>

 <p>While there, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/interview-notch-on-the-future-of-minecraft">I again interviewed Persson</a>, and again spoke to a very modest, very bemused man, who rather sweetly believed that the game had already sold more copies than it would after going gold later that year (it had sold about one million at that point, it’s now at well over 350 million). We got on well. It was a good time. I would go on to be one of Persson’s regular targets of online harassment when everything went bad.</p>

 <p>And it was not long after, in fact, that things started to sour. It’s tempting to pinpoint this to when Microsoft bought <em>Minecraft</em> for an astonishing $2.5 billion, with at least $2 billion of that going directly to Persson, in 2014. But Persson had been through a lot of personal tragedy from the end of 2011 onward, and his online behavior had already begun to shift. By 2014 GamerGate had started, and while Persson began as a decent voice against that movement, it didn’t last. Given that I repeatedly had Notch’s over one million Twitter followers sicced upon me, I felt the shift very personally. <em>Minecraft</em> began to stink of that, of Persson’s revolting comments against feminism and LGBTQ rights, and then his complete collapse into QAnon. By 2019 I kinda hated the game.</p>

 <p>I have this cursed object in my house, a totem of all this: a cardboard Steve head signed by Persson in early 2011. God knows if it’s valuable—it precedes any official Mojang merch having been made, instead created by some local Swedish company Persson had commissioned. It sits in the cupboard above the water tank, covered in dust, this peculiar emblem of that incredible time of optimistic joy for indie gaming.</p>

 <figure id="attachment_2000656452" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000656452"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000656452">© Microsoft / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <h2>Doing Donuts</h2> <p>Donut SMP is one of the most popular public “Survival MultiPlayer” servers <em>Minecraft </em>players can join, seeing a peak of nearly 46,000 players in the last 24 hours, where anyone can log in for free and start exploring its enormous world. It’s the creation of high-profile <em>Minecraft</em> YouTuber <a href="https://www.youtube.com/DrDonutt">DrDonut</a> (known to his mom as Nate Filson), and offers players a space to build, craft, raid and, perhaps more than anything else, generate in-game income. An intricate in-game market where anyone can buy and sell resources and crafted items (and again, I stress, for free) encourages new players to start making money by selling the basic resources needed by the long-term super-rich players who can’t be bothered to mine them for themselves. Quickly, enterprising kids can start raking in cash, allowing them to buy coveted powerful tools in order to craft impressive bases, or more likely, start running their own farms to profit even further.</p>

 <p>Before the Christmas break, my 11-year-old son asked about getting a&nbsp;<em>Minecraft&nbsp;</em>Realm. These are essentially rented spaces on a server that allow up to 10 people to simultaneously play in the same&nbsp;<em>Minecraft</em> world. It’s pretty cheap, so I said sure, and the boy began inviting his classmates to join him. And it was, for maybe three weeks, glorious! It was incredible to see these kids come together, building wonderful bases, designing amazing XP farms, and then cooperating on adventures for resources. Then, factions developed, people made “alliances” that were rapidly broken, betrayal was felt, and revenge was sought. Those wonderful bases would be sabotaged, even blown up by one child who felt aggrieved with the rest. One kid started killing the others indiscriminately and stealing their prized items. In-game anger became real-world anger, friendships were harmed at school, and eventually my son didn’t want to go back. It was too sad in there now. But, instead, he asked if it might be possible to join the server he had spent countless hours watching others play in on YouTube.</p> <p>It turns out, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mPbVIS5wL6A&amp;t=8s">joining servers on a Nintendo Switch</a> is no easy task. It involves editing DNS settings, then spoofing server access to force the console build of the game to let you enter server addresses, and the whole thing is fraught with crashing and errors. But, once figured out, the boy got in and immediately knew what he was doing. And given it was the holidays and I wasn’t chained to my desk, he asked if I would join him too.</p> <figure id="attachment_2000656450" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000656450"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000656450">© Microsoft / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <h2>Farming joy</h2> <p>I was reluctant because, as I say, my relationship with <em>Minecraft</em> had become fraught. I’ve played with him in local multiplayer a bunch over the years, but it’s never really clicked for us; all I ever want to do is dig down and find diamonds, while he wants to do far more interesting and complicated things like farm skeletons or investigate other arcane mysteries. But here, in DonutSMP, our desires matched perfectly! To get started, we needed to make money, and to make money we needed someone to dig stupid amounts of resources, and someone who knew how to craft them into something worthwhile. Together we’re the perfect team!</p>

 <p>We now have the most extraordinary secret base, in which my son has figured out how to use redstone to build contraptions that automatically harvest sugarcane and cacti, then push them into channels of water that sort them into chests. And I really mean he figured it out—rather than following a guide, or copying a YouTuber, he somehow intuited the method of observers and pistons needed to automate all this. He informs me that he’s equally surprised at his own discovered skills. I randomly teleport away to try to gather some rails or cobwebs, while he deftly battles mobs that spawn above us and designs increasingly clever new machines. Then it’s his turn to explore great distances away where he inevitably finds something incredible like an ancient underground city, or the half-looted remains of another player’s base.</p> <p>Oh, and that’s the constant threat. DonutSMP is, ultimately, a hostile place. Funnily enough, in many ways it’s like&nbsp;<em>Arc Raiders</em> in the sense of a PvE world that contains the constant threat of unexpected PvP. The 40,000 people playing are spread across so much space that it’s very unlikely to see someone else at any point—I never have—but you’ll see <em>signs</em> of other players&nbsp;<em>everywhere</em>. The ground often bears the scars of battles, or peculiar towers of blocks stretching impossibly into the sky, giving this sense of an abandoned world in which you’re scraping to survive, yet one constantly belied by the menu-based market in which other players greedily buy your stacks of iron bars or enchanted shears. (Seriously, no one copy me, but I’ve made a <em>fortune</em> selling Unbreaking III shears for ridiculous prices!) But all the time, we’re surrounded by the existential fear that another player might stumble upon our underground realm, most likely when we’re not playing, and take everything from us. Or perhaps even just wantonly vandalize our hours of labor. (Hence our location being blurred out in all the screenshots!)</p>

  <p>Those markets have also been the most extraordinary introduction to the perils and cruel machinations of capitalism for the boy. Seriously, this should be used in schools to explain the concept of supply and demand. There we are, bringing in $50,000 a stack for our piles of crafted rails, when some bastard gets on and starts listing the same for $15,000. What to do? Reduce our prices to compete? Wait until those bargain tracks are gone and hope the market recovers? Or, as I cannot resist, buying up everything the twerp is selling, then relisting it on the store at a sensible price. The speed with which it mimics (satirizes, even) the stock markets is chilling and hilarious.</p> <p>And through all of this, I’ve realized I’ve rediscovered that first love. Once again, there’s a purpose and a reason for me to dig down for diamonds, just now with the bonus ending of crafting pickaxes we can then enchant and sell for $150,000 to someone who can’t be bothered to make them for themselves. Between us, me and the boy have made <em>millions</em>, and perhaps far more importantly, we’ve had a brilliant time together in this equalizing environment during cold wintry mornings.</p> <p>Everything I loved about&nbsp;<em>Minecraft</em> is relevant here, with that infinite possibility given a deeper, more resonant meaning through both the vulnerability and the sense of a shared space with the person I love most in the world. I can forget all that grimness of the mid-2010s and return to this splendid game in a way that feels meaningful, and rather more importantly, enormously fun. That weird Steve head sits sadly in the cupboard, this adumbration of a lost time, but it can be forgotten. I’ve got shears to enchant.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        <p>It can be tempting, in an era where there are simply <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2025-09-26/the-video-game-industry-has-a-problem-there-are-too-many-games">way too many great games</a> coming out every month, to give into list inflation. Top 10s become top 25s. Top 25s become top 50s. By 2030, we might even see our first top 100 GOTY list. <em>Kotaku</em> has not been immune to the ebb and flow of year-end trends. <a href="https://kotaku.com/goty-best-games-2022-elden-ring-god-war-ragnarok-marvel-1849934499">In 2022</a>, we slimmed our best game picks down to 10. <a href="https://kotaku.com/goty-best-games-2024-astro-bot-dragon-age-star-wars-1851726357">In 2024</a>, we went all the way up to 15. Each list was correct in its own way, but sometimes annual rituals draw their strength from embracing tradition rather than changing with the times.</p> <p>To that end, <em>Kotaku</em>‘s top games of 2025 list this year will go back to straddling the Goldilocks GOTY middle ground <a href="https://kotaku.com/the-12-best-video-games-of-2015-1750944200">of 12 best games</a>. We are still ranking them and describing why each made the cut, but we have gone out of our way to limit ourselves to promoting what we feel are the best of the best. Lists are defined as much by what gets left off of them as anything else. Those painful sacrifices at the bottom of the cut-off are not in vain. They give the rest of the list its juice. So without further ado, here are<em> Kotaku</em>‘s best games of 2025.</p>

 <hr> <h2>12. <em>Donkey Kong Bananza</em></h2> <figure id="attachment_2000656427" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000656427"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000656427">Nintendo</figcaption></figure> <p>Games are partly defined by the actions they allow. Hand the controller to someone who rarely plays games and you’ll quickly see reasonable assumptions about exploration and play collide with the idiosyncratic limitations of games many of us take for granted. “Why can’t I go there? Why can’t I do this?” For decades, platformers have been oriented around moving through carefully calibrated environments. Fancy Rube Goldberg machines that nevertheless remains static under the hood.</p>

 <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/donkey-kong-bananza-destructible-environments-ocd-1851786630"><em>Donkey Kong Bananza</em></a> turns everything on its head with one simple transgression that has huge consequences: what if you could break stuff? It’s a question so bold, the game comes with a level reset button baked in because the possibilities are so chaotic you could very well wreck your playthrough. The results are endlessly rewarding though, letting you dig tunnels, stack bridges, and continually uncover secrets where most games are, by design, hellbent on never letting you go. The arsenal of power-ups Donkey Kong unlocks, combined with sprawling, freeform environments, leads to an uneven but irresistible sandbox that not only reinvigorates the franchise but breaks new ground in one of gaming’s oldest, most well-worn genres. <span>—</span>&nbsp;Ethan Gach</p>

 <hr> <h2>11. <em>Pokémon Legends Z-A</em></h2> <figure id="attachment_2000656177" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000656177"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000656177">Game Freak</figcaption></figure> <p><span>Admittedly, I went into </span><i><span>Kotaku</span></i><span>’s Game of the Year discussions fully ready to let </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-legends-za-review-switch-2-bugs-performance-2000637719"><i><span>Pokémon Legends: Z-A</span></i></a> <span>fall off the list. But when we actually sat down, I was surprised that an actual argument for its placement just started flowing out of me.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><i><span>Pokémon </span></i><span>games are always met with a barrage of criticism, both merited and unmerited, because Game Freak and The Pokémon Company are carrying the world’s biggest sack of cash on their back with the most profitable franchise in the world in their hands and still aren’t releasing games with the same level of scale and polish as other AAA games.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><span>Eventually, after the dust has settled and people look back on them, plenty of games that are met with harsh criticism upon release get a reassessment. So let’s skip to that part: </span><i><span>Legends: Z-A </span></i><span>is perhaps the most impressive, holistic reimagining the series has seen in probably all of its nearly 30 years.</span></p>

 <p><i><span>Legends Z-A</span></i><span>’s focus on one city means that it lacks the typical “journey” that’s always been synonymous with </span><i><span>Pokémon</span></i><span>, but Game Freak uses that smaller stage to home in on everything it’s done well in the Switch era. Its real-time battle system is one of the most transformative changes Game Freak has ever brought to these games, and while yes, there will always be a place for the series’ classic turn-based combat, I would love to see this approach become a foundation for not only </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-leak-generation-10-wind-wave-galar-legends-mmo-2000635337"><span>future </span><i><span>Pokémon </span></i><span>games</span></a><span>, but also for a competitive scene that mixes timing, parrying, dodging, and more into its battles.</span></p> <p><span>Beyond the battles, </span><i><span>Legends: Z-A </span></i><span>doubles down on Game Freak’s recent dedication to narrative and character work, bringing together one of its most memorable casts of weirdos yet and letting you stick with them through the game’s entire run</span><span>. It’s a rich space for </span><i><span>Pokémon </span></i><span>to get contemplative, examining everything it’s ever done in the name of catching ‘em all.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><i><span>Legends: Z-A </span></i><span>is the result of a team let off the leash and </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-legends-za-leak-video-old-build-teraleak-window-2000655988"><span>looking to do something more than it’s been allowed</span></a><span> to do for decades. Like the game’s Urban Redevelopment plan meant to bring people and Pokémon together in harmony, it may just be another experiment in Game Freak’s journey to figuring out what the future of the franchise looks like, but I hope </span><i><span>Legends: Z-A </span></i><span>turns out to be a more foundational moment for the next 30 years. Or at least a sign that more big swings like it are on the way. — Kenneth Shepard</span></p>

 <hr> <h2>10. <em>Battlefield 6</em></h2> <figure id="attachment_2000656170" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000656170"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000656170">EA</figcaption></figure> <div dir="auto" data-qa="virtual-list-item" role="listitem" aria-roledescription="message" data-qa-hover="true" data-qa-unprocessed="false" data-qa-placeholder="false" data-msg-ts="1767119346.325529" data-msg-channel-id="D095XST8Q0G" id="message-list_1767119346.325529" tabindex="0" aria-setsize="-1" data-item-key="1767119346.325529"> <p>It had been far too long since a really good&nbsp;<i data-stringify-type="italic">Battlefield&nbsp;</i>game. Thankfully,&nbsp;<i data-stringify-type="italic"><a href="https://kotaku.com/battlefield-6-review-steam-ps5-campaign-multiplayer-2000633379">Battlefield 6</a>&nbsp;</i>provided fans, myself included, with an incredible entry in EA’s online FPS series.&nbsp;<i data-stringify-type="italic">BF6&nbsp;</i>isn’t perfect, but nobody was asking for that. What we wanted was a modern military shooter that wasn’t as fast and silly as&nbsp;<i data-stringify-type="italic">CoD</i>, but not as slow and tactical as&nbsp;<i data-stringify-type="italic">ARMA</i>. And that’s what we got. Nice. <span>— </span>Zack Zwiezen</p> <hr> </div> <h2>9. <em>Blippo+</em></h2> <figure id="attachment_2000656165" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000656165"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000656165">YACHT, Telefantasy Studios, Noble Robot</figcaption></figure> <p>In 2025, it started becoming harder to identify things created with generative AI on sight. The obvious tells such work used to contain became increasingly rare, and so we sometimes had to squint harder, had to do more research, to be sure that clip circulating on Bluesky of someone telling off ICE agents in a particularly satisfying way or tearfully reuniting with their dog was real, and not just footage fabricated purely to manipulate our emotions.</p> <p><i data-stringify-type="italic">Blippo+&nbsp;</i>would have been an extraordinary game in any year, but it felt particularly resonant in this one because it’s just so exuberantly, unabashedly, undeniably human, a collaborative work made by very creative people. It’s lively and weird and smart and queer and hopeful. It’s also an innovative and exciting exercise in storytelling and worldbuilding. In&nbsp;<i data-stringify-type="italic">Blippo+</i>, you watch the TV broadcasts of an alien planet whose slate of programming includes game shows, talk shows, science shows, sci-fi sitcoms, news programming, cooking shows, celebrity gossip shows, and so on. Through them, you experience a gradual process of discovery, learning more about this planet that’s both very similar to and very different from our own, and getting attached to the personalities who speak to you from beyond the galactic bend.</p>

 <p>As time passes, a story unfolds of an event that shakes Blippian culture to its core. The game has plenty to say about possibilities for change in our culture, too, and how technology and media can be tools of the status quo, or mechanisms for disruption and progress. It’s timely, unique, and terrifically entertaining. And I’m still sad that I don’t have any more episodes of&nbsp;<i data-stringify-type="italic">Werf’s Tavern&nbsp;</i>to watch. <span>—</span> Carolyn Petit</p> <hr> <h2>8. <em>Avowed</em></h2> <figure id="attachment_2000656169" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000656169"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000656169">Obsidian Entertainment</figcaption></figure> <p>It might not be the biggest open-world RPG ever made, but&nbsp;<i data-stringify-type="italic">Avowed&nbsp;</i>is one of the best precisely because it excises so much of the usual fluff and gunk so often featured in these kinds of games and focuses on snappy action, fantastic writing, memorable companions, and excellent world-building. <span>— </span>Zack Zwiezen</p> <h2>7. <em>Elden Ring Nightreign</em></h2> <figure id="attachment_2000656428" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000656428"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000656428">FromSoftware</figcaption></figure> <p><span>The premise of <em>Elden Ring Nightreign</em> sounds like a bizarre fan mod but in practice it’s one of the most satisfying, challenging, and inventive multiplayer action games around. It proves you don’t need loot grinds, battle passes, or branded crossovers to keep a live-service experience feeling fresh and compelling, and that procedurally-generated open-world dungeons can prove as tense, thrilling, and brutally surprising as the most bespoke MMO raids. <em>Nightreign</em> is not just a brilliant roguelike, it’s a blueprint for how co-op can fundamentally transform a familiar experience into something even greater. — </span>Ethan Gach</p>

 <hr> <h2>6. <em>Arc Raiders</em></h2> <figure id="attachment_2000633740" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000633740"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000633740">Embark</figcaption></figure> <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/arc-raiders-review-extraction-loot-shooter-embark-2000642198"><em>Arc Raiders</em></a> is 2025’s shared joy, the <em>Helldivers 2</em> for the misanthropic crowd, and an extraction shooter in which acts of PvP have become sinful. And like most sins, a perverse pleasure for those who partake.</p> <p>It so deftly combines the best of a multiplayer survival shooter with loot-hunting horror, delivering this all in distinct chunks where visits to the above-ground world are limited to 20 minutes for even the bravest player. Inventory space is your most valuable resource, each square precious as you decide whether it’s worth filling with any of the seven trillion items that can be retrieved, weighing up weight and wait against the frantic dash for an exit.</p> <p>Few games are capable of offering the same constant sense of ass-curdling fear, of only&nbsp;<i data-stringify-type="italic">just</i>&nbsp;making it, and then the colossal sense of loss when failure eventually catches up with hubris.&nbsp;<i data-stringify-type="italic">Arc Raiders</i> is a bite-sized game that you’ll play for entire banquets, compelling you to reach further, run farther, and risk more, just for the sake of incremental improvements and the all-consuming satisfaction of numbers going up. <span>— John Walker</span></p> <hr> <h2>5. <em>Split Fiction</em></h2> <figure id="attachment_2000656176" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000656176"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000656176">Hazelight Studios</figcaption></figure> <p><span>After </span><i><span>It Takes Two</span></i><span>, it’s surprising Hazelight hadn’t run out of ideas and was able to put together another co-op platformer filled to the brim with original, ever-evolving design ideas that make its dozen or so hours a synergetic joy to play with a friend, lover, or enemy you’re trying to learn to get along with. </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/split-fiction-review-hazelight-coop-game-it-takes-two-1851767470"><i><span>Split Fiction</span></i></a> <span>is the apex of Hazelight’s brand of cooperative design, using its blend of science fiction and fantasy settings to riff on different subgenres and finding a way to make each of them a concise, bite-sized game all on its own.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><i><span>Split Fiction</span></i><span>’s premise of a city cynic and a country bumpkin fighting their way through each other’s stories is pretty loose, though it does stumble (likely on accident) into some pertinent pro-artist, anti-AI sentiment.

 <hr> <h2>4. <em>The Hundred Line: Last Defense Academy</em></h2> <figure id="attachment_2000656175" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000656175"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000656175">Too Kyo Games</figcaption></figure> <p><span>Too Kyo Games’ visual novel/strategy RPG hybrid remains one of 2025’s most impressive quiet success stories. The studio, helmed by the leads on both the </span><i><span>Danganronpa </span></i><span>and </span><i><span>Zero Escape </span></i><span>games</span><span>, went into debt to make </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/the-hundred-line-last-defense-academy-the-kotaku-review-2000651792"><i><span>The Hundred Line: Last Defense Academy</span></i></a> <span>happen after nearly a decade of </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/master-detective-archives-switch-review-danganronpa-1850592843"><span>good but not groundbreaking efforts</span></a><span>, and was </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/hundred-line-last-defense-academy-too-kyo-bankrupt-1851786150"><span>in danger of closing its doors</span></a><span> if the game didn’t pop off. A less bold developer could have played it safe and tried to create something simple and palatable for a wide audience, but </span><i><span>The Hundred Line </span></i><span>is an incredibly bold Hail Mary that leaves it all on the line, and it’s one of the most impressive games of 2025 and of the visual novel genre because of it.</span></p> <p><i><span>The Hundred Line </span></i><span>is a dense tribute to the genre, with 100 endings and dozens of routes that cover multiple visual novel staples, from zombie horror to a more tongue-in-cheek harem story, all within the confines of the war one group of high school students must fight with an incoming alien invasion. Though routes varies in quality, they are all, at least, baseline good and riff in some profound ways on the game’s core premise. The highs, however, have </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/the-best-danganronpa-game-is-getting-an-enhanced-remake-with-a-twist-2000625415"><i><span>Danganronpa</span></i></a> <span>lead Kazutaka Kodaka doing career-best work with his signature focus on characters caught between despair-inducing struggle and a logic-defying hope and belief in the good of even the worst of humanity.</span></p>

 <p><span>All of these threads and timelines are held together by tactical battles that may not reach the same tour-de-force level as the game’s branching storylines, but do employ a rock solid puzzle-like system that uses its large cast of freaks and weirdos to great effect, giving them each singular battle styles that reveal just as much about these high schoolers locked in war as any branching timeline might.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>Though it’s a dense tome of hope, despair, absurdity, and mystery that can be hard to recommend to the average person, the developers’</span><span> ambition of creating one of the largest visual novels ever, with dozens of routes spanning multiple genres all while funneling into the core mystery, is so bold it demands respect. But perhaps the most admirable part about it is that Too Kyo Games actually pulled it off. Having a bold idea that you even attempt to put on a Switch cartridge can get you pretty far, but </span><i><span>The Hundred Line </span></i><span>didn’t just try to become one of the most ambitious games of its genre. It succeeded. — Kenneth Shepard</span></p> <hr> <h2>3. <em>Death Stranding 2: On the Beach&nbsp;</em></h2> <figure id="attachment_2000656164" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000656164"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000656164">Kojima Productions</figcaption></figure> <p>Any game that contains Dollman is already a contender for one of the best. But&nbsp;<i data-stringify-type="italic">Death Stranding 2&nbsp;</i>is also a mechanically dense and extremely confident adventure that is weird in a way most games of this size aren’t anymore.

A remarkable example of interactive storytelling, it employs both grounded realism and wild surrealism to immerse us in its place and time and capture how soccer can be both an all-consuming individual obsession and part of a fabric that binds friends, family, or even an entire nation together. I know next to nothing about soccer but I know what it is to harbor a passion, to see and feel something you love everywhere you look, to feel like part of a larger whole because of it.&nbsp;<em>Despelote&nbsp;</em>is a gift, an opportunity to spend a few hours in the life of another human being through the experience of a wildly original game, and featuring <a href="https://kotaku.com/best-video-game-moments-scenes-2025-clair-obscur-ending-2000655769">a climactic moment</a> that I consider one of the most audacious and memorable gaming moments I’ve ever encountered. <span>— Carolyn Petit</span></p>

A lot, actually, With so much of the industry rallying around Sandfall Interactive’s RPG as one of the defining games of the year, it sometimes feels like the game itself has become an almost untouchable symbol of what video games can </span><span>still </span><span>be despite the ever-encroaching dangers of slop and live-service money and time sinks.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>Right now, it feels like everyone is hanging their hopes and hatreds on </span><i><span>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</span></i><span>, to the point where </span><a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/no-clair-obscur-expedition-33-wasnt-made-by-30-people"><span>falsehoods that support the narrative</span></a><span> have become far more prevalent than </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/clair-obscur-expedition-33-budget-cost-goty-sandfall-2000652590"><span>what actually got us here</span></a><span>. And when it </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/clair-obscur-expedition-33s-loses-indie-game-awards-after-being-accused-of-lying-about-ai-use-2000655119"><span>falls short of the ideals</span></a><span> some ascribe to it, or is wielded in debates about how </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/indie-game-awards-iga-igf-gdc-clair-obscur-expedition-33-2000644070"><span>we divide games up in award shows</span></a><span>, it </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/clair-obscur-2-gen-ai-awards-sandfall-interactive-2000655599"><span>becomes a centerpiece of a new conversation</span></a><span>, often led by people who </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/persona-director-says-jrpg-3-0-is-coming-to-re-shape-the-genre-at-a-fundamental-level-2000647233"><span>weren’t paying attention to a genre that never actually went away</span></a><span>. Sandfall Interactive’s RPG has, likely against its will, become the game of 2025 in more ways than one as it becomes wedged into every conversation the community is having.</span></p> <p><span>With things so dire, it feels like the video game industry is looking for a savior, or something that proves that the slop c-suite executives are forcing into every game shop doesn’t have to be the way forward. But trying to imperfectly hang every axe to grind on one game has a way of obscuring what it actually is, as it becomes a symbol burdened with more than any one game should have to bear.</span></p> <p><span>So when you push the narrative to the side with all your might, what is </span><i><span>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</span></i><span>? It’s a turn-based RPG that marries </span><i><span>Final Fantasy</span></i><span>’s grandiose storytelling and magical battle systems with </span><i><span>Paper Mario</span></i><span>’s </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/clair-obscure-parry-sakapetate-chromatic-troubadour-1851781507"><span>timing-based mechanics</span></a><span> to make something that is both strategic and engaging enough to make even the classic RPG grind </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/clair-obscure-expedition-33-stendahl-maelle-build-nerf-1851779728"><span>entertaining and rewarding</span></a><span>. Its grief-driven story is filled with misdirection and twists that have divided player opinion, but those divisions are rewarding to consider and debate, and it culminates in </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/clair-obscur-expedition-33-ending-verso-maelle-choice-1851778284"><span>a devastating decision</span></a><span> in its eleventh hour that fans are </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/clair-obscur-expedition-33-ending-choice-canon-correct-2000633292"><span>still talking about months later</span></a><span>. The game’s cast of sad boys and girls walking into what is ostensibly a suicide mission have endeared themselves to fans of a genre that will carry their flags for years to come in art, cosplay, and other fan creations.</span></p>

 <p><span>All of these lovingly crafted systems and stories are coming from a debut game by a new studio full of industry talent that had become dissatisfied at the big studios where they previously worked, and it’s already being mentioned in conversations alongside genre staples like </span><i><span>Persona </span></i><span>and </span><i><span>Final Fantasy</span></i><span>, and…oops. Maybe I’m susceptible to The Narrative, too. It is a juicy one. A team of talented developers, writers, and artists who left big publishers like Ubisoft to do their own thing, making games that look like the big-budget efforts people still want but without the meddling of a publisher trying to inject some live-service grind into them, and being rewarded with success and acclaim does feel like the antidote to problems plaguing the industry. If nothing else, perhaps it’s a sign that more games like it are possible, and if we do get more such games, then perhaps this one will become less of a golden idol for a community looking for proof that the industry’s future isn’t as bleak as it once felt, and it can finally be appreciated solely based on what a stunning debut it is. — Kenneth Shepard</span></p>      </div></div><br/><br/>https://kotaku.com/the-12-best-video-games-of-2025-2000656161]]></content:encoded>
