            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><p>
                  Built-in Fire TV lets you stream more than a million movies and TV shows, plus watch live TV.
                </p><div>
              
              <p>Is your living room in need of a new TV, or do you want a screen for your bedroom to enjoy your favorite shows while snuggling in the blanket? Prefer a smaller screen and not looking to shell out big bucks on the upgrade? The TCL 40-inch Class S3 TV checks all those boxes.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6938/">Currently, this modest-sized TV is going for just $150 at Amazon, after the retailer took 21% off its usual $190 price tag</a>. It’s the lowest we have seen this screen go in a long while, and placing your orders today can also help you skip delivery charges altogether. But as you’d expect, the deal is selling out fast. If you’ve been looking to add a new screen to your entertainment setup, now is the time to act.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6938/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>



<h2>Impressive Visuals</h2>
<p>The 40-inch size is pretty decent. It’s not massive, but also not too small to make the content feel cramped. This size is ideal for bedrooms and smaller living areas where you don’t want the screen to take over the entire wall. With this one, you’re getting an elegant edge-to-edge glass design for that modern look that blends effortlessly into any space.</p>
<p>The 1080p full HD resolution delivers a bright, sharp, and detailed picture quality, which can bring any content to life. There’s also a direct LED backlight for better brightness uniformity and picture performance compared to edge-lit TVs, which adds to the immersive experience. Whether you’re catching up on the latest crime thriller on Netflix or streaming a nature documentary, you’ll experience breathtaking detail with exceptional color accuracy. Yellow won’t turn into neon, and shadows stay visible instead of turning black. The latter is especially helpful when you’re playing a game on the TV, as it helps you spot enemies hiding in the dark easily.</p>



<p>You’ll also never be out of content to watch, thanks to the built-in Fire TV. This TCL screen comes with all the popular streaming platforms – like Netflix, Prime Video, Disney+, Peacock, and more – preinstalled. There’s support for Spotify too, which makes it easy to vibe to your favorite songs in the background as you finish house chores. Most of these platforms, however, require a monthly subscription. Looking to cut back on those? No sweat. Free options such as Freevee, Pluto TV, Tubi, plus live channels, are available too. Maybe start the day by catching up on what’s happening around the world with live TV, and then wind down at night with an episode of your all-time favorite show. All is possible, and that too, without cable.</p>
<p>Navigation is made easy with the Alexa voice remote. It lets you search and launch content both manually and using your voice. For instance, when you’re not in the mood to press some buttons, you can say something like “Alexa, launch Netflix”, or “Alexa, show me the latest horror movies on Prime Video”, and your command will be answered in seconds. Additionally, AirPlay compatibility lets you share videos, photos, and music, and more to the TV from your compatible iPhone or iPad.</p>
<p>There are more features to appreciate here, but to wrap it up, if you’re looking to grab a new smart TV without breaking the bank, this 40-inch TCL TV deal makes the jump easy. Just be sure to act before it’s too late.</p>

              <p>Drumming up attention for the finale of Amazon Prime’s second season of <em>Fallout</em>, the fantastic first season is gradually being added to YouTube to watch over the next few days. However, if you’re looking to catch up on the first run without paying for Prime, you’ll need to get your gas-powered skates on.</p> <p>As I saw on&nbsp;<a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/entertainment/sci-fi-shows/okie-dokie-fallout-season-1-is-now-free-on-youtube-but-its-going-back-to-the-vault-very-soon/"><em>GamesRadar</em></a>, Amazon Prime’s official YouTube channels around the world have added the first two episodes of 2024’s first season of&nbsp;<em>Fallout</em> to watch for free. The live-action adaptation of Interplay and Bethesda’s <em>Fallout</em> games was wildly better than anyone could have hoped, and proved a colossal hit for Amazon’s streaming service. The <a href="https://kotaku.com/fallout-tv-show-amazon-prime-audience-ratings-1851445138">network claimed 65 million viewers over the first two weeks</a>, and it went on <a href="https://kotaku.com/2024-emmy-nominations-fallout-walton-goggins-shogun-1851597281">to scoop a couple of Emmy nominations</a>.</p>

 <p>The release schedule is a bit odd, with <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xOKDDkFt4W0&amp;list=PLWz2DO39R-NX9gYByO7231inaftQYqI8v&amp;index=2">the first two episodes online now</a>, and then another two added every day until all eight are up by Jan 31. However, they won’t be there long: Prime will pull the videos on the turn of February 11, meaning you’ve got a fortnight to cram them all in. Heck, don’t wait, you can watch the first episode right now, right here!</p>  <p>Season two is ongoing, and proving to be equally fantastic television, delivering some jaw-hanging violence and brilliant dialogue, as well as delighting long-time fans of the games with all manner of <a href="https://kotaku.com/fallout-season-2-finally-brings-back-two-classic-pieces-of-the-franchise-2000661833">in-jokes and easter eggy references</a> for fan-favorite <em>Fallout: New Vegas</em>. And, seriously, if you’re a fan of watching heads go pop, no show has you better covered. Also, with just one episode yet to appear, it’s also <a href="https://kotaku.com/fallout-season-2-finally-fixing-dumb-midnight-release-time-2000663241">now releasing at a far less inconvenient time</a> than midnight.</p>

 <p>So no excuses now. And given the pleasingly quick turnaround of the second season just 18 months after the first (yes, this still seems bonkers-slow to people who remember network television, but it’s&nbsp;<em>so</em> much faster than the norm for these premium shows), perhaps you’ll not have to wait too long to see season two appear on YouTube.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Pokémon TCG’s Latest Set Suffers A Big Delay]]></title>
            <link>https://kotaku.com/pokemon-tcg-ascended-heroes-delay-booster-2000664086</link>
            <guid>1419460</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><p>
                  The rules have also changed to mean <i>Ascended Heroes</i> won't be legal for the European Championships
                </p><div>
              
              <p>While the&nbsp;<em>Pokémon TCG</em> has been in dire straits when it comes to availability for well over a year now, this has primarily been a result of a massively inflated resale market driving scalpers to scoop up all new releases and making it close to impossible for regular customers to buy online or in stores. But with the first new set of 2026, <em>Ascended Heroes</em>, the problem seems to be The Pokémon Company itself.</p>

 <p><em>Pokémon&nbsp;</em>card sets come in two types: there are the “main series expansions” that release with 36-pack booster boxes (usually bought by retail and sold individually) alongside Elite Trainer Boxes and various other bundles, with the majority of the product made available on day one. Then there are so-called “special expansions” that have no booster boxes or individually sold packs, but rather just the ETB and a broader range of other types of bundles. Special sets also tend to have more staggered releases, with new bundles and collection boxes appearing every now and then throughout a year. Ascended Heroes, the third set in the current Mega Evolution generation of TCG cards, is one such special set, but its initial release appears to be far more staggered than intended (thanks&nbsp;<a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-pokemon-company-has-officially-delayed-the-pokemon-tcg-mega-evolution-ascended-heroes-two-pack-blisters"><em>IGN</em></a>).</p>

 <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="und" dir="ltr">Pokémon TCG Product Legality Update <a href="https://t.co/6eOCIpvkKe">https://t.co/6eOCIpvkKe</a> <a href="https://t.co/ujIpp9VLYC">pic.twitter.com/ujIpp9VLYC</a></p> <p>— Play! Pokémon (@playpokemon) <a href="https://twitter.com/playpokemon/status/2016587353247404141?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 28, 2026</a></p></blockquote>  <p>Officially released Friday 30 January, Ascended Heroes will be appearing with a real whimper. The set is super-attractive to collectors because it will see the return of both Trainer Pokémon and, more importantly, the Mega Pokémon cards emblazoned with the Japanese for their special attacks—something not seen since 2015’s XY Primal Clash. For reasons undeclared, this will not launch as expected, with the usual ETBs (that tend to contain nine to 11 packs, along with a special card, a set of dice, counters and dividers) already not showing up for three weeks, set to appear on February 20th. Instead, tomorrow was supposed to bring us two booster pack types, one pair of Tech Sticker Collections that come with three packs, a bonus card, and a sheet of stickers, a a pair of two-pack checklane blister packs that come with a bonus card and a coin featuring trainers Larry and Erika. The latter has now been announced as delayed until February 20th as well, making it seem frankly odd not to just delay the entire set’s release until next month.</p> <p>The bizarre release schedule of&nbsp;<em>Ascended Heroes</em> has also meant TPCi has had to <a href="https://www.pokebeach.com/2026/01/tpci-changes-tournament-legality-rules-for-special-sets-ascended-heroes-legality-date-moved-after-euic">change the rules</a> regarding when special expansion cards can become legal for tournament play, such that this new set now&nbsp;will not be playable in the upcoming European Championships. The new rule is that cards only become legal two weeks after either the set’s ETB or Booster Bundle has been released, and given the ETB is delayed until late February, that means the cards will not be allowed on the February 13 tournament.</p>

 <p>Of course, it’s not actually possible to pre-order&nbsp;<em>any</em> of these items anywhere, and you’ll be lucky to find the single release that is happening tomorrow in stores. Given the difficulty finding any sets from the last year and a half, “special” sets feel especially galling at the moment, with single packs not even an option. Eventually, over the year, <em>Ascended Heroes</em> will add quite a few larger collection boxes with eight packs in each, along with two-pack mini-tins, likely along with other unannounced product. The challenge will be finding any of it at RRP, rather than scalpers’ over-inflated resale prices.</p>

 <p>Right now, trying to pick up the $50 <em>Ascended Heroes</em> ETB <a href="https://www.tcgplayer.com/product/668496/pokemon-me-ascended-heroes-ascended-heroes-elite-trainer-box?page=1&amp;Language=English">will cost you around $150</a>, while the six-pack Booster Bundle due for April 24 at $27 is already seeing pre-orders <a href="https://www.tcgplayer.com/product/668541/pokemon-me-ascended-heroes-ascended-heroes-booster-bundle?page=1&amp;Language=English">resold at around $80</a>. It’s ludicrous, and it’s getting worse.</p> <p>Due to a whole other sort of delay, this time caused by the recent storms in the U.S. affecting shipping, our review of <em>Ascended Heroes</em> will also be coming later than expected (the original embargo was today). We’ll hopefully have more details very soon.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Apple AirPods Pro 3 Already Have Old-School Pricing After a Sudden Price Drop]]></title>
            <link>https://kotaku.com/apple-airpods-pro-3-already-have-old-school-pricing-after-a-sudden-price-drop-2000663959</link>
            <guid>1419454</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>The holidays are a mere blip in our collective rearview mirror now, so why are <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4214/">Apple’s newest and arguably best AirPods still at their all-time low price of $199 at Amazon</a>? Don’t know, don’t care, don’t want to jinx it — we just want to get there before somebody looks at the calendar and removes this $50-off deal on the AirPods Pro 3 altogether.</p>
<p>The Pro 3 were one of the biggest audio tech drops of 2025. As hard as it is to believe, it’s been less than six months since they hit the market and sent waves of audiophiles scurrying to get some of the first pairs. Next-level active noise cancellation at twice the level of the AirPods Pro 2 is an awfully good start for a sales pitch, but Apple packed so many more upgrades and innovations into the AirPods Pro 3 that it’s worth revisiting them.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4214/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Better for Longer</h2>
<p>Active noise cancellation is a notorious battery hog for wireless earbuds and headphones, yet somehow Apple doubled the level of ANC from the AirPods Pro 2 to the Pro 3 and still boosted the battery life to 8 hours of listening time with ANC and 10 hours without. The redesigned MagSafe charging case now has a built-in speaker that makes locating them with the Find My app far easier.</p>
<p>The earbuds themselves received a very subtle but very effective facelift. They’re more streamlined, and the redesign was aimed at a more secure fit in your ear. That’s huge if you’re planning on making the AirPods Pro 3 your go-to source of entertainment while you’re working out, running, or otherwise physically active. The new foam-infused ear tips now come in five sizes, including a new XXS version, which addresses the unpredictability of ear shapes and sizes. Workout and exercise fans will also appreciate the health-monitoring upgrades, including real-time heart-rate monitoring and calories burned count that you can see on your iPhone.</p>



<h2>Sound Investment</h2>
<p>It’s really about the sound, of course, and the AirPods Pro 3 are now packing spatial audio and updated, vastly improved bass. That’s on top of the potent active noise cancellation, so your entire listening experience is getting an upgrade from the Pro 3 earbuds. The hearing aid and hearing test features and live translation? More icing on a really tasty audio cake.</p>
<p>It’s not as if Apple or Amazon are needing to unload a lemon with this deal — the AirPods Pro 3 are very possibly Apple’s best-yet wireless earbuds, and the reviews have been nearly unanimously great. Don’t waste time pondering why <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4214/">they’re still at a record-low $199 at Amazon a full month after the holidays</a> — just go buy yourself a pair.</p>
