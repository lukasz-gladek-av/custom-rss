            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Nintendo revealed its Black Friday 2025 deals last month and there was no <a href="https://kotaku.com/switch-2-is-on-amazon-pre-order-invite-usa-available-1851785835">discounted Switch 2 among them</a>. This was not surprising, given that the new hardware became the fastest-selling console launch ever this year. What is surprising is that Walmart decided to do its own discounted Switch 2 <em>Mario Kart World</em> bundle for Cyber Monday, and Amazon followed suit.</p> <p>Earlier today, <a href="https://www.walmart.com/ip/Nintendo-Switch-2-plus-Mario-Kart-World-Bundle/16422361549">Walmart</a> crashed the fake internet retail holiday with the best deal on a Switch 2 yet. It was $50 off the <em>Mario Kart World</em> bundle, which includes the $80 game and is usually priced at $500. At just $450, it essentially gave customers the game for free. <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Nintendo-SwitchTM-Pok%C3%A9monTM-Legends-Switch-2/dp/B0FC5FJZ9Z?tag=kotaku01-20">Amazon</a> then followed up with its own match, and at least as of the time of writing, I was able to get one in my shopping cart for the discounted price (the Walmart one wasn’t working).</p>

 <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">Nintendo Switch 2 Mario Kart Bundle still available for $449 at Walmart (price in cart) <a href="https://t.co/BHwEEWL35g">https://t.co/BHwEEWL35g</a> <a href="https://t.co/eqFxtps9Kk">pic.twitter.com/eqFxtps9Kk</a></p> <p>— Wario64 (@Wario64) <a href="https://twitter.com/Wario64/status/1995527157121224954?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 1, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <p>It’s unclear how much longer the deal will last, or if it might sporadically come back throughout the holiday season. Is it an extremely limited discount, or are Walmart and Amazon just that desperate to get people through their online doors? Or maybe it was a last-minute decision in a hyper-competitive holiday season, as people get more discerning about their purchases while everything shoots up in price.</p>

 <p>The only other console maker doing big discounts this year is Sony, which took $100 off the price of the <a href="https://kotaku.com/sony-ps5-black-friday-deals-dualsense-edge-controller-2000645182">PS5 Pro and standard model</a>, both of which had already been marked up due to recent tariff-fueled pricing adjustments. Nintendo, on the other hand, seems happy to have customers pay full price for most of its new games and even its old consoles.</p> <p>A Switch <em>Mario Kart 8 Deluxe</em> bundle that had been a mainstay of the company’s Black Friday sale lineup for years <a href="https://kotaku.com/switch-2-black-firday-sales-2025-mario-zelda-2000642413">was MIA this year</a>. I guess it didn’t want to be caught competing with itself. The Xbox Series X/S, more expensive than ever, didn’t get a discount either.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><span>We know </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/sonic-4-film-sequel-confirmed-march-spring-2027-sega-1851744323"><i><span>Sonic the Hedgehog 4</span></i></a> <span>is coming in 2027, but it looks like another live-action </span><i><span>Sonic </span></i><span>movie is coming not too long after. Is this the rumored Shadow-centric spin-off we’ve been hearing about? It better be, Paramount.</span></p> <p><span>According to </span><a href="https://variety.com/2025/film/news/sonic-spinoff-movie-teenage-mutant-ninja-turtles-live-action-film-2028-release-dates-1236596459/"><i><span>Variety</span></i></a><span>, Paramount has added a new “Sonic Universe Event Film” to its schedule that will premiere on December 22, 2028, four years after </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/sonic-hedgehog-3-review-shadow-keanu-reeves-jim-carrey-1851726797"><i><span>Sonic the Hedgehog 3</span></i></a> <span>debuted last December. </span><i><span>Variety </span></i><span>notes this movie will be a spin-off, which means it likely won’t follow the blue blur and his friends. There have been longstanding </span><a href="https://www.sonicstadium.org/articles/sonic/rumor-shadow-movie-officially-in-development-at-paramount-they-want-to-do-an-amy-rose-project-r3181/"><span>rumors</span></a><span> that a spin-off movie about Shadow the Hedgehog, Sonic’s black-and-red rival played by Keanu Reeves, was on the table if </span><i><span>Sonic the Hedgehog 3 </span></i><span>did well, and it got around half a billion at the box office.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>Shadow was the antagonist of most of </span><i><span>Sonic 3</span></i><span>, and seemingly sacrificed himself to stop his original plan to destroy the world. The movie’s </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/sonic-hedgehog-3-4-post-credits-amy-rose-metal-shadow-1851726285"><span>final post-credits scene</span></a><span> shows him recovering his inhibitor rings that fell to Earth in the film’s climactic space battle, implying that he would return in a future movie or television series.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><span>What we know so far about </span><i><span>Sonic 4 </span></i><span>makes it sound like Shadow won’t be in the next numbered film, so a spin-off starring him would be the next best thing. Could this be when the film series finally introduces the other members of Shadow’s Team Dark: treasure hunter Rouge the Bat and Eggman’s estranged robot Omega E-123? Please, Paramount. I need Shadow to find his new family after losing everything in </span><i><span>Sonic 3</span></i><span>.</span></p> <p><span>Whatever this movie is, it will premiere just about a year and a half after </span><i><span>Sonic 4</span></i><span>, which is set for theaters on March 19, 2027. The fourth film will focus on newcomers Metal Sonic and</span><a href="https://kotaku.com/sonic-3-post-credits-amy-reverse-sonamy-relationship-1851730058"><span> Amy Rose</span></a><span>, who were teased in </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/new-sonic-3-concept-art-may-clear-up-that-confusing-pos-1851743775"><i><span>Sonic 3</span></i><span>’s post-credits scene</span></a><span>, and seems to be a loose adaptation of </span><i><span>Sonic CD</span></i><span>.</span></p>

            <title><![CDATA[Nightreign‘s Deadliest Field Boss Is Not Who I Expected]]></title>
            <link>https://kotaku.com/nightreigns-bell-bearing-carion-draconic-tree-sentinel-2000649218</link>
            <guid>1369717</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><em>Elden Ring Nightreign</em>‘s first DLC, <em>The Forsaken Hollows</em>, <a href="https://kotaku.com/elden-ring-nightreign-dlc-forsaken-hollows-artorias-dark-souls-2000643101">is out later this week</a>. Ahead of its release, publisher Bandai Namco spilled the beans on which of the roguelike multiplayer game’s field bosses have killed players the most. Anyone who has played for any length of time probably expected Bell Bearing Hunter to be crowned the most deadly, but that honor has actually gone to the Royal Carian Knight. Quiet frankly, I don’t believe it.</p> <p>The newly released info graphic lists the “<a href="https://www.bandainamcoent.com/news/elden-ring-nightreign-eye-of-the-storm-infographic">8 most deadly field bosses</a>.” Field bosses are the major enemies that exist at various points on the map during the day. Strong ones give players better loot and more levels. Also an early grave. Here’s the ranking according to Bandai Namco:</p>

 <ol> <li>Royal Carian Knight</li> <li>Draconic Tree Sentinel</li> <li>Erdtree Avatar</li> <li>Bell Bearing Hunter</li> <li>Pot-Troll</li> <li>Black Blade Kindered</li> <li>Death Rite Bird</li> <li>Ulcerated Tree Spirit</li> </ol> <figure id="attachment_2000649223" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000649223"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000649223">FromSoftware / Bandai Namco</figcaption></figure> <p>The top two aren’t completely out of left field. Both horseback bosses have tons of mobility, are brutal up close, and will wreck you with long-ranged magic attacks, especially if you’re trying to escape. Most of the times I’ve died to one of them, I wasn’t even trying to fight them, just climb up a cliff. Erdtree Avatar is a little more surprising to me. He’s brutal if you’re not ready to fight him, but pretty predictable and easy to avoid once you’ve got decent levels and equipment. So is Death Rite Bird at number seven. I always avoid the Bird at all costs.</p>

 <p>Speaking of avoiding bosses, that brings us to Bell Bearing Hunter. The unsuspecting field boss walks softly but carries a big sword. Many a <em>Nightreign</em> player has encountered him, though “oh yeah, I got this,” and then after landing their first attack and nearly being one-shotted in response, immediately realized “oh no, I actually don’t got this at all.” He’s become a meme in the community for being the one boss everyone knows to avoid. You can tell you’re playing with a new player if you encounter Bell Bearing and they don’t immediately keep running.</p>

 <p>So what’s he doing at number four? There are two possibilities here. 1.) He’s not actually the hardest, and despite his legendary status on the <em>Nightreign</em> subreddit and Discord, players have a way harder time with the Royal Carian Knight and Draconic Tree Sentinel. Or 2.) Bell Bearing has killed fewer players because they never bother fighting him to begin with. It all comes down to whether Bandai Namco is measuring total body count or averaging those proportional to the actual number of encounters. Carian Knight might have killed more players, while Bell Bearing actually has a higher win-rate against them.</p> <p>I’ve asked Bandai Namco for clarification. The <a href="https://kotaku.com/elden-ring-nightreign-deep-night-hard-mode-time-changes-2000624664">mythmaking around <em>Nightreign</em>‘s most legendary boss</a> is at stake. All I know for sure is that when <em>The Forsaken</em> <em>Hollows</em> goes live on December 4, I’m running past both Carian Knight <em>and</em> Bell Bearing.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/assassins-creed-shadows-switch-2-port-gameplay-comparison-ps5-xbox-fps-ubisoft-2000649204</link>
            <guid>1369690</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><em><a href="https://kotaku.com/assassins-creed-shadows-review-is-it-good-xbox-ps5-rpg-1851770647">Assassin’s Creed: Shadows</a>,</em> Ubisoft’s latest big open-world RPG, makes the long-rumored leap to Switch 2 this week, and footage of the game running on Nintendo’s console looks as impressive and playable as the publisher’s previous port of<em><a href="https://kotaku.com/star-wars-outlaws-switch-2-port-patch-is-ithttps://kotaku.com/star-wars-outlaws-switch-2-port-patch-is-it-good-2000624465good-2000624465"> Star Wars: Outlaws</a>.</em></p> <p>When <em>Assassin’s Creed: Shadows</em> launched earlier this year, <a href="https://kotaku.com/assassins-creed-shadows-graphics-seasons-screenshots-1851770252">I called it one of the best-looking open-world video games of the generation</a>. Ubisoft’s digital recreation of Feudal Japan featured multiple seasons, incredible draw distances, gorgeous lighting, rock-solid performance, and highly detailed environments. So when Ubisoft officially announced the long-rumored Switch 2 port of <em>Shadows</em> was real and launching on December 2, I was nervous. Sure, the publisher pulled off a technical marvel by getting <em>Outlaws</em> to run on Switch 2. But would <em>Shadows</em> work as well on Nintendo’s machine? The answer is yes. Yes, indeed.</p>

 <p>Ahead of its Tuesday launch, some folks who have already been playing <em>Shadows</em> on Switch 2 began sharing direct comparisons of the new port with how the game looks on PS5 and Xbox. <a href="https://youtu.be/Lh5sCdKyVlc">YouTube channel ElAnalistaDeBits</a> posted a great video comparing all three versions, and perhaps the biggest takeaway is that while <em>Shadows</em> on Switch has, understandably, cut some graphical corners, it’s still remarkable how alike all versions of the game look side-by-side.</p>

   <p>Like <em>Star Wars: Outlaws</em> on Switch 2, which impressed us earlier this year, <em>Shadows</em> runs at 30 FPS on Nintendo’s console with no option to play at 60FPS. That’s a shame, but also not surprising. It should also be noted that <em>Shadows</em> on Switch 2 isn’t a rock-solid 30, but pretty dang close. And hey, while it might lack a higher-framerate option, the <a href="https://www.ubisoft.com/en-us/game/assassins-creed/news/3eHpj3aktX4nWY150OEHJL/assassins-creed-shadows-deep-dive-into-the-nintendo-switch-2-system-port">Switch 2 port of <em>Shadows</em> lets you manipulate the map using the touchscreen</a>, which is handy.</p>

 <p>The biggest visual cuts found in<em> Assassin’s Creed Shadows</em> on Switch 2 involve reduced draw distance, a less sharp image, and water reflections. In particular, reflections are completely gone in most places on the Switch 2 port, which can make rivers and lakes look dull and flat. On the flipside, texture quality is good and looks more than fine when playing the game in handheld mode. In fact, a lot of these changes will be much harder to spot when playing on the Switch 2’s screen compared to a big 4K TV.</p> <p><em>Star Wars: Outlaws</em> and now <em>Assassin’s Creed Shadows</em> seem to indicate that Ubisoft is taking the Switch 2 very seriously as a platform. The publisher has delivered two of the best-looking and playing <a href="https://kotaku.com/switch-2-ports-cyberpunk-2077-ps4-ps5-xbox-dlss-outlaws-1851782817">open-world games on the console this year</a>, and I imagine past Ubisoft titles will likely be making the leap in the future. And with cross save across all consoles and PC, the Switch 2 might become a very popular way for Ubisoft open world sicko fans, like myself, to enjoy these big games on the go or when traveling.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><span>It’s been almost three months since right-wing commentator Charlie Kirk was </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/charlie-kirk-shooter-helldivers-bullet-engraving-2000625439"><span>assassinated in September</span></a><span>. When it happened, the right was quick to </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/sucker-punch-charlie-kirk-ghost-yotei-boycott-2000646987"><span>tear down anyone who didn’t suddenly forget his prejudiced rhetoric when he was killed</span></a><span>, but in the months since, a lot of the fallout of Kirk’s death has been in memes, whether that be in </span><a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@anaylhc/video/7574231060104465686?lang=en"><span>“Kirkifying” images</span></a><span> by photoshopping his face on anything you can find, </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/charlie-kirk-assassination-bandai-namco-ai-model-gunpla-2000626472"><span>AI mock-ups of gunpla sets</span></a><span> of his death, or </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/nba-2k26-charlie-kirk-character-creator-neck-tattoo-2000629891"><span>creating characters that look like him in video games</span></a><span>. In the past few weeks, an AI-generated song about Kirk has begun spreading throughout the internet, and you’ve probably heard it in fandom spaces online.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZUHpUXlsvbI"><span>“We Are Charlie Kirk”</span></a><span> is a three-and-a-half-minute, AI-generated slop song by AI “artist” Spalexma. As the name implies, the song is meant to be a tribute to Kirk, and a declaration that his supporters will “carry the flame” of his right-wing views. It is absolutely one of the most ostentatious, dramatic pieces of “music” I’ve ever heard. The song was originally posted just a week after Kirk’s death, but it has gained significant traction on various platforms in the weeks since.</span></p>

  <p><span>The AI singer is belting with the passion you’d typically hear in an ‘80s power ballad, all about how those still on Earth will pick up the torch now that Kirk is gone. Whether the AI slop was meant as a genuine tribute to Kirk or a musical encapsulation of the right’s self-important made-up war on behalf of Christianity, the song has, like much of the reaction to Kirk’s death, been swept up in the shitpost factory, and the internet has been littered with videos set to the song with more views than the original. Some videos play it straight, simply using its hokey, anthemic instrumentation as a backdrop for dramatic imagery. Others have basically made it a modern-day Rick Roll, a musical rugpull meant to troll anyone who passes by it online.</span></p>

 <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">Disney has updated the ‘GUARDIANS OF THE GALAXY’ soundtrack after several music licenses expired.</p> <p>(via: Disney+) <a href="https://t.co/7VGxePHyOv">pic.twitter.com/7VGxePHyOv</a></p> <p>— Wong Updates (@WongUpdates) <a href="https://twitter.com/WongUpdates/status/1994897434758320635?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 29, 2025</a></p></blockquote>               <p><span>While a lot of “We Are Charlie Kirk’s” appearances are rooted in internet-poisoned irony, a lot of people are using the song to make fun of the right’s cult-like admiration for its political figures, like this video in which someone saw a truck covered in images of Kirk and the American Flag. There’s a comment under this one that says, “They don’t even treat Jesus like this.”&nbsp;</span></p>     <p><span>“We Are Charlie Kirk” is currently Spalexma’s most-popular song on streaming services like Spotify, but even there, its streams are dwarfed by the views videos using it have gotten over the past three months. So it seems like most people aren’t listening to it unironically. The AI “artist” has several other songs that seem to be Christian in nature, so I assume this song was meant to be an earnest tribute to Kirk, but the internet has definitely not taken it that way, and continues to run it into the ground.</span></p> <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">"what are we?" we are charlie kirk girl</p> <p>— brandon (@BR0IG) <a href="https://twitter.com/BR0IG/status/1992709018201317653?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 23, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">some kids on the bus started blasting we are charlie kirk &amp; the hooded guy in front of me turned round to look at them and it was riz ahmed <a href="https://t.co/QhWZnWVbyC">pic.twitter.com/QhWZnWVbyC</a></p> <p>— lú (@botaniyya) <a href="https://twitter.com/botaniyya/status/1994448939764904010?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 28, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">“We are Charlie Kirk, we carry the flame, we fight for the gospel, we'll honor his name.” <a href="https://t.co/WzQhLav68c">pic.twitter.com/WzQhLav68c</a></p> <p>— Just a Random JOLLY Person 🎄☃️ (@aRandom_acc_) <a href="https://twitter.com/aRandom_acc_/status/1994122109195563292?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 27, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">"We are all Charlie Kirk" <a href="https://t.co/hZUO5F3ivT">pic.twitter.com/hZUO5F3ivT</a></p> <p>— TheRealThelmaJohnson (@TheRealThelmaJ1) <a href="https://twitter.com/TheRealThelmaJ1/status/1992828878029828213?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 24, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">teto: we, are, charlie kirk. we are charlie kirk</p> <p>miku: we, are, charlie kirk. we are charlie kirk</p> <p>neru: we, are, charlie kirk. we are charlie kirk</p> <p>all 3 together: we, are, charlie kirk. we are charlie kirk <a href="https://t.co/RV1PMnafpv">pic.twitter.com/RV1PMnafpv</a></p> <p>— REIKA (@0_ka815) <a href="https://twitter.com/0_ka815/status/1991768913039004058?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 21, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">GTA 6 will reportedly feature a “We Are Charlie Kirk” radio station that loops the track for roughly 6/7 hours 🔥‼️ <a href="https://t.co/6dkjoNxxja">pic.twitter.com/6dkjoNxxja</a></p> <p>— GTA 6 Info (@GTASixInfo) <a href="https://twitter.com/GTASixInfo/status/1993760858368078228?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 26, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">this is part of the reason why the "we are charlie kirk" and "kirkification" memes went insanely viral. you can't mandate reverence for a generation that saw their classmates get slaughtered in school shootings. <a href="https://t.co/LQkovzmD7f">https://t.co/LQkovzmD7f</a></p> <p>— hasanabi (@hasanthehun) <a href="https://twitter.com/hasanthehun/status/1994510376046834132?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 28, 2025</a></p></blockquote>
