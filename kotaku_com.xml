              <p>PC gamers were left scratching their heads when <a href="https://kotaku.com/lego-batman-legacy-dark-knight-everything-we-know-date-2000663464"><em>Lego Batman: Legacy of the Dark Knight</em></a> revealed its surprisingly beefy spec requirements last month. The recommended rig to play the open-world action game would need a whopping 32GB of RAM. No longer. The action-adventure’s developers have now slashed that requirement in half as the great AI-fueled RAM shortage of 2026 intensifies.</p> <p>The <em>Lego Batman</em> specs were a shock when they were first spotted <a href="https://twitter.com/JakeTheL3mur/status/2012737400544350217?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E2012737400544350217%7Ctwgr%5Efd34a35d456b8d5e150c2e218cfc364e8e95ac5a%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fkotaku.com%2Fwp%2Fwp-admin%2Fpost.php%3Fpost%3D2000668982action%3Dedit">on January 17</a>. They were immediately compared to the specs for the last Lego game, 2022’s <em>Star Wars: The Skywalker Saga</em>, which had a recommendation of just 8GB of RAM. That number had been multiplied four times for TT Games’s newest Lego anthology in as many years. It was immediately accused of being the latest example of PC games coming in hot and under-optimized.</p>

 <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">The left is The Requirements for LEGO Star Wars: The Skywalker Saga</p> <p>The Right is the Requirements LEGO Batman: Legacy of the Dark Knight</p> <p>WHAT THE ACTUAL FUCK ARE WE DOING HERE GUYS!?<a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/LEGO?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#LEGO</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/LEGOStarWars?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#LEGOStarWars</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/LEGOBatman?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#LEGOBatman</a> <a href="https://t.co/qYDmO3mHi8">pic.twitter.com/qYDmO3mHi8</a></p> <p>— L 3 M U R (@JakeTheL3mur) <a href="https://twitter.com/JakeTheL3mur/status/2012737400544350217?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 18, 2026</a></p></blockquote>  <p>The studio responded at the time by saying that <em>Lego Batman</em> was still being optimized but&nbsp;<em>something</em> had to be submitted on the spec sheet to get a Steam listing published so the game could <a href="https://twitter.com/zayinpriv/status/2013012344712937946?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E2013012344712937946%7Ctwgr%5E1f9eace8ea501c7d7ee38918cb2dfa71bef86d7e%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.thegamer.com%2Flego-batman-legacy-of-the-dark-knight-pc-specs-confusion%2F">start collecting pre-orders and wishlists</a>. It turns out TT Games was being conservative and significant improvements have been made. No one’s going to have to go out and buy another 16GB stick just to run around Lego Gotham when the game launches on May 29.</p> <p>“As part of our ongoing testing for <i>LEGO Batman: Legacy of the Dark Knight</i> on PC, we have revised our recommended hardware specifications from 32 GB RAM down to 16 GB RAM,” reads <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2215200/view/509605417596223740">a new update</a> on February 13. “Please note, our PC specs at this stage are not final. We will be continuing to optimize and make improvements as we move closer to launch. For more information, visit our product page on Steam.”</p> <h2>RAM shortage fuels spec retreat</h2> <p><em>Lego Batman</em> isn’t the first game to go on this recommended PC spec rollercoaster ride. IO Interactive’s <em>007: First Light</em>, out just days before on May 27, also walked back a pretty unforgiving initial spec sheet earlier this year. That game also recommended 32GB at first before later dropping the requirement to 16GB. Its VRAM requirement dropped as well. IO Interactive <a href="https://twitter.com/007GameIOI/status/2011735420631982151?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">blamed the whole thing</a> on a miscommunication.</p>

 <p>To put this all in perspective, say you were someone planning on playing one or both of these games on PC. Your rig only has 16GB of memory right now, so you’d have originally needed to upgrade. If you’d done that last fall, the popular <a href="https://pcpartpicker.com/product/p6RFf7/corsair-memory-cmk16gx4m2b3200c16">Corsair Vengeance LPX 16 GB (2 x 8 GB) DDR4-3200 CL16 Memory</a> would have only cost you $80. Now it’s being sold for double that at $160, at least when it’s available to buy at all.</p>

 <p>These AI-fueled price hikes don’t seem to be turning around anytime soon. Valve already blamed these spikes for why <a href="https://kotaku.com/steam-machine-price-release-date-preorder-ai-valve-2000665802">the Steam Machine’s pricing hasn’t been revealed yet</a> and why it’s now expected to ship later in the first half of 2026 than previously planned. <em>Lego Batman</em> wasn’t the first to budge on its spec requirements, and it definitely won’t be the last PC game this year to blink, either.</p>

              <p><span>The most memorable experience I’ve ever had with a captcha, those li’l online tests you have to complete to prove you aren’t a bot trying to DDOS someone’s blog, was being shown a puzzle grid that used images of the building I was currently sitting in.

Before gaining access to this mysterious site, you’ll have all of your web browsing faculties tested, from correctly identifying fire hydrants, simple math, and agreeing to the terms of service, to devilish riddles, grass touching, and proper art appreciation.</span></p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/sega-genesis-hideki-sato-dies-dreamcast-2000668977</link>
            <guid>1436335</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><span>“We knew how to make arcade games, we didn’t really know anything about console development,” </span><a href="https://shmuplations.com/segahistory/"><span>Hideki Sato told </span><i><span>Famitsu</span></i></a><span> in an oral history of Sega. “They sold so well, we started to get stars in our eyes.” Sato was a steward to Sega’s biggest consoles, from the original SG-1000 right through to the Dreamcast. The storied engineer passed away this Friday, February 13, 2026, at age 77.</span></p> <p><span>Joining Sega back in 1971, Sato saw the company go through every transformation firsthand, from a U.S.-based electronics enterprise to a Japanese gaming power-house, and from a titan of the arcade hall to one of the fiercest competitors of the home console wars. While involved in the original SG series and the Master System, Sato’s star ascended in 1989 when he was promoted to director of Sega’s Research and Development department. There he and his team were tasked with a herculean feat: take down Nintendo.&nbsp;</span></p>

  <p><span>The Nintendo Entertainment System crushed Sega’s Master System. The NES rose from the ashes of the early ‘80s crash and dominated markets around the world. Sega wanted to get revenge in the second round. For the 16-bit era, they’d introduce something that synthesized their arcade strengths with what was possible at home with new, budget-friendly microchips. Sato wanted a home console with the visual appeal of an up-scale sound system, making it sleek, rounded and black with contrasted gold lettering. “That gold printing, by the way, was very expensive,” Sato told </span><i><span>Famitsu</span></i><span>.</span></p> <p><span>The result was the Mega Drive, known as the Genesis in North America. With a two-year head start on the Super Nintendo, the console was a massive hit even before the debut of </span><i><span>Sonic the Hedgehog</span></i><span>.</span></p>   <p><span>Sato oversaw all of Sega’s classic systems. The Mega Drive made Sega a household name, showing off what they did that </span><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k7nsBoqJ6s8"><span>‘Nintendon’t.’</span></a><span> The uncanny Sega Saturn was the world’s peek at the true potential of a dedicated 3D, CD-based console. And of course Sega’s swan song, the Dreamcast, ended up being a beloved underdog whose hard shake didn’t stop it from hosting the loudest, most uncompromising games of the era.</span></p>

 <p><span>Even beyond the heat of the console wars, Sato’s influence on the gaming world was felt in immeasurable ways. Magazine </span><i><span>Beep21</span></i><span> had already been compiling a new book about </span><a href="https://x.com/Beep2021/status/1924655482024952281"><span>Sato and Sega’s hardware legacy</span></a><span>. Just last December, Sega co-founder David Rosen also </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/games/2026/jan/05/sega-co-founder-david-rosen-dies"><span>passed away at 95</span></a><span>.</span></p>

            <title><![CDATA[Saudi Arabia Looks To Extend Death Grip Over Game Industry With New $6 Billion Acquisition]]></title>
            <link>https://kotaku.com/saudi-arabia-bytedance-moonton-acecraft-mobile-ea-2000668972</link>
            <guid>1436317</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Saudi Arabia’s appetite for gaming consolidation is reportedly unsated. <a href="https://kotaku.com/ea-saudi-arabia-ownership-trump-jared-kushner-2000649726">Its leveraged buyout to take over <em>Battlefield 6</em> publisher Electronic Arts</a> isn’t even complete yet and it’s already eyeing other major deals, according <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/bytedance-talks-sell-gaming-unit-moonton-more-than-6-billion-sources-say-2026-02-13/">to <em>Reuters</em></a>. This time the target is TikTok owner ByteDance’s gaming subsidiary Moonton which could sell for as much as $7 billion.</p> <p><em>Reuters</em> reports that the “broad terms” of the transaction are already agreed upon, with the official deal possibly getting announced as early as March (thanks <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/one-of-the-biggest-gaming-buyouts-in-history-is-reportedly-underway/1100-6538177/"><em>GameSpot</em></a>). ByteDance purchased Moonton back in 2021 for $4 billion and Saudi Arabia, through its game investment vehicle Savvy Games Group, is apparently willing to pay over 50 percent more than that just a few years later.</p>

 <p>So what the hell does Moonton make to justify that spiking valuation at a time when so many other parts of the game industry are financially plateauing? The Shanghai-based subsidiary’s biggest game is the 2016 MOBA <i>Mobile Legends: Bang Bang</i> which has been downloaded over a billion times. Last year it also launched the auto battler <em>Magic Chess: Go Go</em>, the RPG <em>Silver and Blood</em>, and the coop vertical shooter <em>Acecraft</em>.</p>   <p>That last game is a thinly-veiled remix of <em>Cuphead</em> and features cartoon icons like Bugs Bunny, Daffy Duck, Tom, and Jerry as fighter pilots. Some players feel like it’s essentially a microtransaction casino dressed up in the retro animation stylings of Studio MDHR’s hit 2017 indie action platformer. Weirdly, the game <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Acecraft/comments/1qgxfrw/acecraft_temporarily_suspended_in_us/">randomly went offline</a> for all U.S. players starting last month. Moonton promised make-up rewards once it returns but it’s still mysteriously MIA.</p>

 <h2>Saudi Arabia corners the mobile gaming market</h2> <p>A $6-$7 billion sale price would make Moonton one of the top-10 biggest gaming acquisitions in history, but it’s hardly the only mobile titan Saudi Arabia has sought to gobble up in recent years. Savvy Games Group also purchased Monopoly Go maker Scopely in 2023 for $4.9 billion and Pokémon Go maker Niantic in 2025 for $3.5 billion.</p>

 <p>The EA acquisition still dwarfs those, but won’t be complete until sometime over the summer. While the <em>Madden</em> and <em>Sims</em> publisher’s board of directors and shareholders overwhelmingly approved a historic $55 billion deal to take EA private, unions and Democrats in Congress have called for investigations and regulatory due diligence before one of the largest American gaming companies is sold to a foreign government.</p> <p>Given Saudi Arabia’s direct line to the White House via President Trump’s son-in-law Jared Kushner, who reportedly helped broker the deal and has a personal stake in it via <a href="https://kotaku.com/ea-sale-saudi-arabia-madden-pif-jared-kushner-2000629829">his own Saudi-backed investment group</a>, that seems unlikely to happen.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Another Multiplayer Shooter Revealed At The Game Awards Faces Layoffs And It’s Not Even Out Yet]]></title>
            <link>https://kotaku.com/den-wolves-layoffs-gtfo-game-awards-cyberpunk-2000668953</link>
            <guid>1436260</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><em>Den of Wolves</em> was revealed at <a href="https://kotaku.com/game-awards-2023-tga-trailers-game-previews-1851082729">The Game Awards 2023</a> with a brutal cinematic trailer teasing bloody cyberpunk heists. Developer 10 Chambers didn’t reveal any gameplay or a release date but it got the shooter on people’s radars. Over two years later it’s still not out and the studio behind prior Steam hit <em>GTFO</em> is already facing layoffs.</p> <p>News of the cuts broke first on LinkedIn on February 13 when individual developers started sharing their layoff stories. “<span data-testid="content-text">This wasn’t on my 2026 bingo card, but here we are wearing the green LinkedIn banner for a while,” wrote one </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/filipblom_opentowork-gamingindustry-activity-7424851079118495745-vIEU?utm_source=social_share_send&amp;utm_medium=member_desktop_web&amp;rcm=ACoAAByD5EUBfxY4kCf3wHtdwCavc5euTv0rxzo" target="_blank" rel="noopener">affected employee</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">. 10 Chambers later confirmed the layoffs in a statement <a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/report-gtfo-developer-10-chambers-lays-off-staff">to <em>Game Developer</em></a> and others.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">“We can confirm that we’re taking a hard look at how we work and how the studio is set up, so Den of Wolves can become the game it deserves to be,” it read. “This unfortunately means a significant restructuring of the studio, impacting a large number of roles, including several of the studio’s co-founders.”</span></p> <p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">It continued, “We remain focused on the vision of<em> Den of Wolves</em>. Ulf Andersson and Simon Viklund remain fully committed to the game and to leading the studio forward. When we have more concrete news to share, we’ll do it through our official channels.”</span></p> <h2 data-testid="content-paragraph">From horror shooter to cyberpunk heists</h2> <p data-testid="content-paragraph">One person who isn’t still committed to the upcoming multiplayer shooter is 10 Chambers co-founder Hjalmar Vikström. He revealed his departure from the studio after a decade of working there earlier in the week. “Next up for me is going indie–making way smaller games, focusing on health and family, and just enjoying game development,” he <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/hjalmarvikstrom_hey-im-not-the-most-active-on-linkedin-activity-7427282044239413248-_sVU/">wrote on LinkedIn</a>.</p>  <p data-testid="content-paragraph">10 Chambers released <em>GTFO</em> in Early Access in 2019 and it immediately gripped players with its grime-y and claustrophobic coop horror gameplay. It revolved around prisoners fighting mutants and avoiding hazards while completing opaque objectives in an underground complex. It was uncompromisingly brutal and gained a devoted following as a result, occasionally spiking to nearly 20,000 concurrents on Steam and acquiring thousands of positive reviews in the process.</p>

 <p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><em> Den of Wolves</em> applies a similarly harsh formula to sci-fi heists, but with much more ambitious trappings. It combines the smash-and-grab break-ins of a <em>Payday</em> with a second layer of nightmare-fueled gameplay where teams hack into fleshy human mind vaults to retrieve the valuable data stored in them. It’s a neat concept that received decent previews in early 2025 but there’s still no launch date.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <h2 data-testid="content-paragraph">Buying more time for <em>Den of Wolves&nbsp;</em></h2> <p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><i>“</i>I’ve been begging management to give us a release window for <em>Den of Wolves</em> in the trailer–but no,” 10 Chambers comms director Robin Björkell said alongside a <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1818140?emclan=103582791474302810&amp;emgid=499465877188510087">new community gameplay trailer in December</a>. “They won’t budge. These developers really don’t want to make promises they can’t keep for the sake of marketing. It makes my job harder, but as a gamer myself, I respect it. I told them we at least need to prove that the game exists, and that was the starting point for this trailer.”</span></p> <p data-testid="content-paragraph">The cuts at 10 Chambers come as many game companies struggle in an ultra-completive release environment where development schedules are taking longer and investment dollars are drying up. Wildlight Entertainment, the team behind January’s new PVP shooter <em>Highguard</em>, <a href="https://kotaku.com/highguard-layoffs-dead-game-awards-live-service-2000668192">recently underwent mass layoffs</a> just weeks after launch and months after a splashy Game Awards 2025 reveal.</p>

 <p data-testid="content-paragraph">“If you know me you’ve heard this before: Making games is hard,” 10 Chamber’s outgoing cofounder wrote on LinkedIn. “And these past years have taken their toll. But thinking back I’m proud of how we managed to punch above our weight and deliver GTFO. Both the Early Access release from a team of 9, and also the releases culminating with GTFO 1.0 from the bigger 10 Chambers team. I’m grateful for the friends I’ve made and everything I’ve learned.”</p>
