              <p>Apple just came out with these M5 MacBook Pro models a few weeks ago and they’re still full price on Apple’s website, but <strong>Amazon decided to spread some holiday cheer by lowering the prices on all models to all-time lows</strong>.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6538/">24GB/1TB model now costs $1,799 instead of $1,999</a>, and <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6538/">the 16GB/512GB model now costs $1,349 instead of $1,599</a>. This means that these M5 machines are actually cheaper than the M4 generation was when it first came out. You get here Apple’s new M5 chip, a stunning 14.2-inch Liquid display that can reach 1600 nits of brightness and a battery lasts all day. The<strong> 24GB model will be shipped before Christmas</strong>, and the 16GB model will be sent by the end of the year.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6538/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Powerful M5 Chip</h2>
<p>The M5 processor doesn’t just make the M4 better but it also changes the way a laptop handles heavy workloads. Each GPU core now has a Neural Accelerator that speeds up AI tasks by a lot which means you can handle machine learning workloads and Apple Intelligence features at speeds that would have needed a desktop workstation just a few years ago. The 10-core CPU can easily handle everything from video editing to compiling software and the unified memory architecture means that your RAM talks directly to the processor, so there are no bottlenecks like those that happen with regular laptop designs.</p>
<p>Apple Intelligence runs completely on your device so your private information never leaves your MacBook to be processed on a cloud server. The system helps you write better, make your ideas clearer, and do repetitive tasks automatically without sending your data to Apple or anyone else. This <strong>privacy-first approach is much more important than most people think </strong>and it lets you use AI features without worrying that your emails, documents, or creative work will end up in a training dataset.</p>



<p>The <strong>14.2-inch Liquid Retina XDR display has a peak brightness of 1600 nits</strong> for HDR content and a steady brightness of 1000 nits for regular use. The 1,000,000:1 contrast ratio makes blacks look really black instead of that grayish tone you see on cheaper laptop screens. The colors are also very accurate, making this a good choice for professional photo and video work.</p>
<p>The promise of a battery life that lasts all day isn’t just a marketing gimmick: This laptop works the same whether it’s plugged in or running on battery power. Most Windows laptops slow down when you unplug them to save power, but the M5’s efficiency lets you render video, compile code, or run resource-intensive creative apps at full speed for hours without needing to find an outlet. You can really take this to a coffee shop and work all day without bringing the charger.</p>



<p>The ability to <strong>work with other Apple devices makes the whole ecosystem better</strong> than any one product could do on its own: You can control your iPhone from your Mac’s screen with iPhone Mirroring which means you can reply to texts or use apps that only work on iPhones without having to pick up your phone. You can copy something on your iPhone and paste it straight into a document on your Mac. You can also start a FaceTime call on your laptop and then switch to your phone when you need to move around.</p>
<p>The 24GB/1TB model costs $1,799, and the 16GB/512GB model costs $1,349 and that’s<strong> less than what the M4 generation cost when it first came out</strong>.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[NordProtect Online Identity Service Covers Up to $10K in Scam Losses, Now Going for Peanuts]]></title>
            <link>https://kotaku.com/nordprotect-online-identity-service-covers-up-to-10k-in-scam-losses-now-going-for-peanuts-2000655012</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>The last shopping rush before Christmas is a great time for cybercriminals because there are so many online transactions, quick purchases, and distracted shoppers. NordProtect’s decision to lower the price of its <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5883/">identity protection service to a record low of $4.49 per month, down from its usual $14.99 rate</a>, is especially important this time of year, when prices are usually lower.</p>
<p>This isn’t just another holiday sale on electronics or entertainment subscriptions that people don’t care about: Identity theft protection deals with a basic security issue that gets worse around the holidays, when fake transactions blend in more easily with real spending patterns and stolen credentials are more actively traded on criminal networks.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5883/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See NordProtect</a></p>
<h2>The Scale of the Problem</h2>
<p>Think about how bad identity theft is in the United States right now. According to the Federal Trade Commission, consumers lost $12.5 billion to fraud last year alone. This is a 25% increase from the year before. In 2024, the agency handled more than 1.1 million identity theft complaints. This means that a new victim came forward every 22 seconds throughout the year.</p>
<h3>Identity Theft by the Numbers</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Every 22 seconds:</strong> A new identity theft case occurs in the United States</li>
<li><strong>1.1 million:</strong><span> Identity theft complaints filed with the FTC in 2024</span></li>
<li><strong>$12.5 billion:</strong><span> Total consumer losses to fraud in the past year</span></li>
<li><strong>44%:</strong><span>&nbsp;Percentage of identity theft cases involving credit card fraud</span></li>
</ul>
<p>These risks are even higher during the holidays: More people shopping online means more chances for data theft, and when there are a lot of legitimate transactions, it’s harder to spot fake charges right away. Phishing attempts that look like shipping notifications or seasonal sales alerts are on the rise, and retailers and payment processors are at greater risk of breaches because their infrastructure is under stress and they have to hire temporary workers.</p>
<h2>How Protection Really Works</h2>
<p>Instead of checking identities by hand every so often, NordProtect uses continuous automated surveillance. You can <a href="https://gizmodo.com/best-vpn/nordvpn/nordprotect">read Gizmodo’s review here to learn more about it</a>. <strong>NordProtect checks credit reports from all three major bureaus</strong>, looks for personal information on dark web marketplaces, and keeps an eye on linked financial accounts for strange activity.</p>
<p>The part that watches the dark web is especially important: There are parts of the internet (dark web) where stolen Social Security numbers, credit card numbers, and full identity packages are traded. When your information shows up in these places, it usually means that there has been a security breach in one of the services you use. Early detection is important because it gives you time to lock down accounts before criminals can use the information.</p>
<p><strong>TransUnion’s credit monitoring service</strong> can catch things like new loan applications, account openings, or changes to your credit limit that you didn’t authorize. The system marks these events right away instead of waiting for monthly reviews of credit reports. When you monitor your bank account, you can spot strange withdrawal patterns, suspicious transfer requests, or debit card use that isn’t safe.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5883/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See NordProtect</a></p>
<p>The value proposition goes beyond just alerts: NordProtect gives you specific instructions on what to do when it finds a problem. If your email is part of a data breach, you will be told which accounts need new passwords, which security questions need to be changed, and whether or not two-factor authentication should be turned on. The service explains how to dispute charges that are not real and how to freeze your credit if they do.</p>
<h2>Financial Protection That Goes Beyond Monitoring</h2>
<p>Most people don’t realize how much it costs to recover from identity theft until they have to deal with it directly. For example, hiring a lawyer to fight fraudulent accounts can cost hundreds of dollars per hour. If you have to take time off work to deal with banks, creditors, and credit bureaus, you will lose money. And the costs of traveling to meet with law enforcement or financial institutions in person add up.</p>
<p><strong>NordProtect covers up to $1 million in identity theft recovery costs</strong>, including legal fees, lost wages, and documented costs related to restoring your identity and credit score.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5883/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See NordProtect</a></p>
<p>Extra parts of insurance cover certain types of threats that aren’t usually covered by identity theft: Cyber extortion coverage pays up to $50,000 for cases of blackmail or ransom demands. Online fraud protection will pay up to $10,000 for money that is stolen directly from bank accounts or credit cards through digital scams. These amounts of coverage show how much damage advanced attacks can do.</p>
<p>Access to dedicated case management may be more valuable than money: When someone steals your identity, NordProtect sends a U.S.-based expert to handle the whole recovery process. This case manager talks to credit bureaus, files reports with banks and the police, keeps track of dispute deadlines, and keeps an eye on the case until it is resolved.</p>
<h2>The Cost of Preventing</h2>
<p>NordProtect is currently charging $4.49 a month, which is 71% less than the normal price and it is the lowest price the service has ever been offered at. This makes full identity protection cheaper than most streaming subscriptions or a single trip to a coffee shop. The service comes<strong> with a 30-day money-back guarantee</strong>&nbsp;so you don’t have to worry about losing money if it doesn’t meet your security needs.</p>
<p>Look at this cost next to the possible costs of recovery. The<em> Identity Theft Resource Center</em> says that people who have their identities stolen spend an average of 200 hours trying to fix the problem. Even at a low hourly wage, this means thousands of dollars in lost productivity. When you add up the costs of hiring a lawyer, buying credit monitoring services after the fact, and possible losses from fake transactions, prevention is much cheaper than reaction.</p>
