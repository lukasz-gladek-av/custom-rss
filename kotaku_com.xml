In the film itself, the name “Thunderbolts” refers to a soccer team Yelena (Florence Pugh) was part of as a child, which her father, Red Guardian (David Harbour), uses as a placeholder name for their team of misfit toys. At the very end, the group is rebranded as the “New Avengers,” officially relaunching the superhero team after its previous lineup disbanded following the events of <em>Avengers: Endgame</em>. Bucky Barnes (Sebastian Stan) leads the team, which makes sense considering he’s the only person who was around as part of the initial group when Thanos was destroying half the known universe, but as seen in the post-credits scene, not every Avengers alumnus is thrilled by this development. Captain America (Anthony Mackie) is suing the group for copyright infringement after he was shown to be in talks to lead a new team under the Avengers banner in <em>Brave New World</em>. So it seems like there will be some tension between the group and other heroes in <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/avengers-doomsday-4-cast-announcement-stream-mcu-marvel-1851772474&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/avengers-doomsday-4-cast-announcement-stream-mcu-marvel-1851772474"><em>Avengers: Doomsday</em></a></span><em> </em>next year.</p><p>Once the group is deemed the New Avengers, the end credits sequence reveals the film’s new, true title: <em>The New Avengers</em>. It’s a clever gimmick that finally contextualizes the asterisk in the movie’s original title. However, it wasn’t enough for Marvel to introduce a New Avengers team through the back door of what appeared to be more of a B-plot film about some of the outcasts of the MCU; the company is also making this a marketing beat and spoiling the movie after one weekend. This isn’t just sequestered into trailers or social media videos; real-world billboards for the film are being updated for people to stumble upon out in the wild.</p><p>I’m torn because, as a marketing campaign, it’s pretty great. From the outside, <em>Thunderbolts* </em>was already fighting an uphill battle as a team-up movie of mostly side heroes in a franchise that no longer has the same cultural cache it once did. So it’s fun to see the movie rebranded as something more seemingly central to the overall MCU as a cheeky acknowledgement of the “oh, you thought you could skip this one?” feeling that has followed it. But also, this movie is only days old, and Marvel is using its massive platform to just spoil it outright for anyone who didn’t have the time or cash to swing by the theater on opening weekend. I’m staunchly against a company trying to control the narrative and tell people not to talk about something they paid money to see (within reason), but I feel even weirder about Marvel making that executive decision collectively for its audience.</p><p>Spoiler culture has gotten out of hand, and people’s almost phobia-like aversion to even pretty basic narrative details has made it almost impossible to talk about media without a comical amount of self-policing in public spaces. But I don’t know if Marvel is the company to take a big, subversive swing on the matter just 72 hours after a movie launched. Maybe there’s something to be said about how the “Thanos demands your silence” nonsense was a trailblazer and that other companies have followed suit in the years since. Maybe <em>Thunderbolts* </em>could be a pivot point that encourages people to stop taking spoiler culture so seriously. But maybe it could have waited one more week or so. Some of us were busy last weekend, Kevin Feige. </p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Again, how reflective that is of the finished game remains to be seen, but Rockstar Games has certainly earned itself the benefit of the doubt in many quarters over the years, especially between <em>GTA V </em>and <em>Red Dead Redemption VI</em>. The footage was running on a PlayStation 5, which is also a boon to those worried the game might only really pop on a PS5 Pro (it’ll also be on Xbox Series X/S but a PC port won’t be ready at launch).</p><p>We’ll see if that widespread enthusiasm remains once the game’s price is announced. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/microsoft-xbox-series-x-s-price-increase-may-2025-1851778615&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/microsoft-xbox-series-x-s-price-increase-may-2025-1851778615">With Microsoft</a></span> <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/switch-2-price-tariff-trump-mario-kart-tour-zelda-totk-1851775036&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/switch-2-price-tariff-trump-mario-kart-tour-zelda-totk-1851775036">and Nintendo</a></span> both moving to $80 for their most premium games, it’s not inconceivable now that <em>GTA 6 </em>could blow past that and come in at $100 <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/gta-6-price-video-game-industry-state-of-release-date-1851740553&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/gta-6-price-video-game-industry-state-of-release-date-1851740553">as some analysts have speculated</a></span>, potentially with an even higher price tag for early access or other deluxe edition bonuses.

Simply not showing footage gets the entire industry talking. So, it’s something of a (fantastic) surprise that a brand new trailer should appear in the wake of the game’s delay into next year.</p><p>Originally intended to release this fall, with multiple games changing their launch plans to try to avoid it, Rockstar said the game needs another six months development time to be up to the standard it wants. Hence, the new release date of May 26, 2026.</p><p>Those who were disappointed, or even worried about the state of the game, should have their mind put slightly at ease by the new trailer. It’s definitively a <em>GTA </em>game, with no big surprises or twists, but rather a bunch of Miami-like vibes and a lot of butts.</p><p>The return to Vice City looks stunning, although it’s not entirely clear from the trailer what’s in-game and what’s cutscene, albeit that it’ll all be made in the same engine.</p><p>The official description for the new trailer reads,</p><blockquote data-type="BlockQuote"><p>Jason and Lucia have always known the deck is stacked against them. But when an easy score goes wrong, they find themselves on the darkest side of the sunniest place in America, in the middle of a conspiracy stretching across the state of Leonida—forced to rely on each other more than ever if they want to make it out alive.</p></blockquote><p>Don’t expect to see any more of the game for a good long while now. Rockstar will likely go back into its bunker and get on with completing the game, not worrying itself about producing any more ads. The game’s going to sell a billionty-million copies either way, if only it gets finished.</p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
