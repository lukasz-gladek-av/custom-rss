            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/monster-hunter-wilds-review-ps5-open-world-rpg-capcom-1851766113"><i><span>Monster Hunter Wilds</span></i></a><span>‘</span><span> performance on PC has been notoriously bad <a href="https://kotaku.com/monster-hunter-wilds-mhw-tu4-title-update-4-pc-fixed-2000652579">going back to launch</a>, and nobody is quite sure why. One new theory suggests part of the problem could be related to all of the game’s DLC add-ons and how it checks for them. It sounds wild, but video footage has made it one of the most convincing possibilities yet.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>Yesterday, user u/de_Tylmarande published a rather lengthy post on the r/MonsterHunter subreddit titled “</span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/MonsterHunter/comments/1qcy3hn/mh_wilds_bad_performance_mystery_solved/?share_id=sKxGG694fIAcaycKb_Qhd&amp;utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_name=androidcss&amp;utm_source=share&amp;utm_term=1"><span>MH Wilds – Bad performance mystery (Solved?)</span></a><span>” As they explain, they discovered the issue by mere chance after playing </span><i><span>Monster Hunter Wilds</span></i><span> through a friend’s Steam account. They immediately noticed that, even though they were using the same machine, </span><i><span>Monster Hunter Wilds’ </span></i><span>FPS was dramatically better when playing the game through their friend’s account than on their own.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><span>After some testing, u/de_Tylmarande came to a bizarre conclusion: the only difference was that their friend had bought all of </span><i><span>Monster Hunter Wilds’ </span></i><span>downloadable content on Steam. As they explained, “on the account with no DLC I get heavy and stable FPS drops down to like 20-25 in hubs, while on the account with all DLC bought it’s 80+ FPS.”</span></p>

  <p><span>Obviously, this claim was a little hard to believe for some users on the subreddit, so u/de_Tylmarande </span><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uf5cICpDXX0"><span>provided a video</span></a><span> of themselves utilizing a custom mod they created that essentially bypasses </span><i><span>Monster Hunter Wilds</span></i><span>’ DLC checks. The theory has gone viral online as a result. </span><span><br> </span><span><br> </span><span>But the story gets even weirder, because u/de_Tylmarande revealed that this isn’t the first time they’ve discovered a performance fix for one of Capcom’s PC games. According to them, </span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/MonsterHunter/comments/1qcy3hn/comment/nzmfveb/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button"><span>they contacted Capcom</span></a><span> with an FPS fix for </span><i><span>Dragon’s Dogma 2</span></i><span> back in 2024. They claim that fix was then incorporated into the next patch for the open-world RPG on Steam.</span><span><br> </span><span><br> </span><span>It’s also worth noting that </span><i><span>Monster Hunter Wilds</span></i><span> players on PC </span><a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/action/monster-hunter-wilds-steam-reviews-absolutely-tank-as-players-lose-patience-with-its-technical-woes-every-time-the-game-gets-updated-my-performance-decreases/"><span>have felt</span></a><span> like performance keeps getting worse with each new update. Each new update for the game also comes paired with new DLC. As of writing, </span><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/dlc/2246340/Monster_Hunter_Wilds/list/162627"><span>190 individual pieces of DLC</span></a><span> are available for the game on Steam. This new theory would explain a lot.</span><span><br> </span><span><br> </span><span>Capcom hasn’t yet confirmed the modder’s findings or substantiated how much of the performance issues might be attributable to the DLC checks. The Reddit sleuth also made clear that they don’t think Capcom is doing any of this on purpose to incentivize players to buy DLC. “I did NOT mean Capcom did this on purpose,” de_Tylmarande wrote in an addendum. “No, no, and again no…it’s just a bug in the code they need to fix.”</span><span><br> </span><span><br> </span><span>No word from Capcom’s end yet on the veracity of de_Tylmarande’s findings, but it will be interesting to see if the issue is suddenly resolved once the next patch for </span><i><span>Monster Hunter Wilds </span></i><span>drops on PC.</span></p>

            <title><![CDATA[Overwatch 2 Teases Its Next Hero And Fans Are Already Underwhelmed]]></title>

            <guid>1407022</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><span>As a competitive game, </span><i><span>Overwatch 2</span></i><span> is in the best state it’s ever been, but its story and hero selection are in a much more tenuous place. Blizzard is finally </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/overwatch-2-story-pve-canceled-campaign-null-sector-2000641177"><span>moving the hero shooter’s narrative along</span></a><span> and teasing heroes fans have been </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/overwatch-2-emre-sarioglu-freja-animated-trailer-who-is-1851771309"><span>waiting to learn more about for years</span></a><span>, but it’s still mostly just gesturing at forward momentum rather than making significant leaps. Now, the team is teasing the next hero coming to the game, and the character in question is arguably emblematic of the rut </span><i><span>Overwatch 2</span></i><span>’s found itself in.</span></p> <p><span>Anran, a fire-wielding hero and the older sister of Wuyang, has been teased already as an upcoming hero, but it seems now she might be imminent. Blizzard released a short audio drama of gorilla scientist Winston sending out invitations to join the Overwatch team while looking at footage of Anran and Wuyang fighting Omnic soldiers.</span></p>

  <p><span>If that wasn’t enough confirmation, fans have datamined voice files of Echo, a hero who can transform into other characters, replicating what seems to be Anran’s Ultimate voice line.</span></p>

 <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">❗ Anran ultimate voicelines are ALREADY in <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/Overwatch2?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#Overwatch2</a> game files</p> <p>You can find them among Echo phrases (her imitating other heroes ultimates). Fun fact: in non-English versions of the game these lines were voiced by a new voice, potentially voice of Anran in the corresponding… <a href="https://t.co/OeIpxCVa44">pic.twitter.com/OeIpxCVa44</a></p> <p>— OverFire / Overwatch (@overfire_news) <a href="https://twitter.com/overfire_news/status/2011521527468941516?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 14, 2026</a></p></blockquote>  <p><span>Anran could be a great hero, but her moving this quickly up the hero queue means a few things. First, it likely means that </span><i><span>Overwatch 2 </span></i><span>is once again passing up a chance to add a new tank hero. We’ve seen Anran in action </span><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ytZnOGwEq9s"><span>in Wuyang’s promo trailer</span></a><span>, and she seems very light on her feet and offense based, unlike the usually bulky, brawling, defensive tanks in the game. 2025 came and went without a new tank being added to the roster, with Blizzard opting to release one support character in Wuyang and two damage heroes in Freja and Vendetta, so tank mains are feeling a little burned right now.</span></p>

 <p><span>Second, </span><i><span>Overwatch 2 </span></i><span>fans have criticized the game for what they perceive to be characters “made for skin sales,” which usually means young, conventionally attractive characters who aren’t quite part of the main story, and who some feel </span><a href="https://x.com/Kagamine_asheOW/status/2011493297731375575?s=20"><span>get skins churned out for them</span></a><span> but little other attention from the devs. Some also have called out that </span><i><span>Overwatch 2</span></i><span>, a game often celebrated for its diversity, has been </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/overwatch-2-kiriko-mercy-venture-reaper-season-12-skins-1851626893"><span>showing favoritism to its east Asian heroes</span></a><span> when it comes to skins, and Anran would be </span><a href="https://x.com/LALALLALLALA21/status/2011492390415053159?s=20"><span>another character</span></a><span> who falls into that category.</span></p>

 <p><span>Not everyone is upset, mind you, but Blizzard has said a few questionable things about upcoming heroes that have fans worried about the future of the game’s hero designs. Though the team did walk it back, there was </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/overwatch-2-oddball-aspirational-character-hero-design-2000617761"><span>a brief controversy</span></a><span> last year about the game moving away from “oddball” heroes like Winston and the robot-piloting hamster Wrecking Ball in favor of “aspirational” characters. Fans took this to pretty much mean “young and hot,” and Blizzard quickly responded saying that “oddities” were still important to the game, and that a character who matches that description is in the works. We’re still waiting on them, though. I guess we’ll see them sometime after Anran, who all evidence points to being the next new hero joining in a future season.</span></p>

            <guid>1406980</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Apple wasted no time ushering in the new year with a compelling deal on one of its most popular laptops. Just weeks into 2026, the 2025 MacBook Air has already received a notable price drop, making it far more accessible for students, professionals, and everyday users alike. Amazon i<a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5068/">s currently offering the M4-powered MacBook Air with 256GB storage for $799, a substantial reduction from its original $999 price tag</a>.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5068/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<p>At just 2.7 pounds, this latest MacBook Air remains an ideal companion for commuters, travelers, and anyone who prefers a lightweight setup without sacrificing capability. The slim chassis hides impressive hardware, including a 10-core CPU and up to a 10-core GPU, along with support for as much as 24GB of unified memory. Powered by Apple’s M4 chip, the laptop delivers a major leap in speed – up to twice the performance of the M1 Air and dramatically faster than older Intel-based models (23 times faster to be exact).</p>
<h2>Everyday Performance</h2>
<p>Apple engineered the M4 chip to work seamlessly with its growing suite of Apple Intelligence features. This means smoother multitasking, quicker responses, and improved efficiency across demanding applications. Whether you’re juggling spreadsheets, editing photos and videos, or running multiple apps and browser tabs, the MacBook Air handles it all with ease while staying cool and silent even with its fanless design.</p>
<p>Battery life remains one of the Air’s strongest advantages. With up to 18 hours of use on a single charge, it’s built to last through long workdays or extended study sessions without constantly searching for an outlet.</p>



<p>The upgraded 12MP front-facing camera captures crisp 1080p video, making it a solid choice for remote work, online classes, and video calls. Paired with a three-microphone array, voice clarity is excellent even without additional accessories.</p>
<p>Everyday usability features are well covered. The backlit Magic Keyboard offers a comfortable typing experience in any lighting condition, while Touch ID provides quick and secure access. Connectivity includes two Thunderbolt ports for high-speed data transfers and external displays, MagSafe charging for added safety, and – thankfully – a traditional headphone jack for wired audio fans who refuse to give up their AUX-powered headphones.</p>
<p>For users already invested in Apple’s ecosystem, the MacBook Air integrates effortlessly with other devices. Features like AirDrop, iMessage, and Handoff make switching between an iPhone, iPad, and Mac feel seamless.</p>
<p>Several configurations are currently discounted. The base 256GB model starts at $799, the 512GB version sits at $999. Each of those comes with 16GB of RAM. A higher-end option with 24GB of RAM and 512GB of storage is priced at $1,199. All represent a $200 cut from their original prices and are available in four finishes: sky blue, silver, starlight, and midnight.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/sophie-turner-lara-croft-tomb-raider-2000660139</link>
            <guid>1406920</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Sophie Turner, best known for her roles as Sansa Stark in <em>Game of Thrones</em> and Jean Grey in<em> X-Men: Dark Phoenix</em>, is the new Lara Croft for the streaming <a href="https://kotaku.com/tomb-raider-lara-croft-amazon-sophie-turner-2000623124">adaptation of <em>Tomb Raider</em></a>. Amazon MGM Studios revealed a first look at the actor in costume and, yup, I think she nailed it.</p> <p>Does that mean the show itself will be any good? Who knows. But it should help limit any skepticism about whether Turner is cut out to take over the English archeologist who moonlights as a puzzle-solving treasure hunter. The role was previously played by Angelina Jolie in the early 2000s and later by Alicia Vikander in the 2018 reboot. Here’s the first photo of Turner in costume, which essentially recreates Croft’s look from the 1996 game beat-for-beat:</p>   <p>The show has already started filming but we still don’t know what the live-action adaptation, helmed by <em>Fleabag</em>‘s Phoebe Waller-Bridge, will entail. Jason Isaacs will play Croft’s Uncle, Atlas DeMornay, while Martin Bobb-Semple plays Croft’s side-kick, Zip. Bill Paterson, meanwhile, will play her butler. Celina Imrie is also onboard as a museum curator while Sigourney Weaver plays someone “keen to exploit Lara’s talents,” according to Amazon.</p>

 <p>There’s no release date for the show yet, but given the production schedule I wouldn’t be surprised to see it pop up sometime in 2027. It follows Amazon’s success in spinning another hit game franchise, <em>Fallout</em>, into a streaming hit, and is part of Hollywood’s broader goldrush to exploit gaming IP instead of creating new ideas. It couldn’t be coming at a better time for the franchise, though.</p>

 <p>A reboot of the 1996 game called <a href="https://kotaku.com/heres-our-first-look-at-tomb-raiders-new-lara-croft-2000652781"><em>Tomb Raider Atlantis</em></a> will launch later this year, followed by the next sequel sometime in the years ahead. That game has been in production for a while. The last new entry was <em>Shadow of the Tomb Raider</em> back in 2018.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/dji-offloads-mini-5-pro-drone-bundles-now-at-a-record-low-with-rc2-controller-and-three-batteries-2000659926</link>
            <guid>1406917</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>If you’ve been thinking about adding aerial shots to your creative toolkit, the DJI Mini 5 Pro Fly More Combo makes a compelling case for taking the leap. Designed to balance performance with portability and ease of use, this drone <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6316/">bundle is currently available for $1,099 (down from $1,599) which is a sizable 31% reduction from its usual price</a>. That discount alone makes it eye-catching, but the real value lies in how complete the package is for anyone eager to start flying immediately.</p>
<p>Inside the box, you’ll find multiple intelligent flight batteries, a dedicated RC2 controller, a charging hub, and a travel-friendly carrying bag. Whether you’re heading out for a weekend hike or planning a more deliberate filming session, everything you need comes along without added hassle.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6316/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>The Drone for Every Skill Level</h2>
<p>The DJI Mini 5 Pro’s capability comes from its compact, lightweight body. It’s small enough to toss into a backpack, yet powerful enough to record sharp 4K HDR video at up to 60 frames per second. The camera’s Dual Native ISO helps maintain image quality across a wide range of lighting situations, so footage stays clean and detailed whether you’re filming under bright midday sun or chasing golden-hour shots.</p>
<p>Performance in the air is equally impressive. A long-range video transmission system delivers a smooth HD feed over great distances, while strong wind resistance and a 3-axis mechanical gimbal help ensure stable, shake-free footage. Even when conditions aren’t perfect, the drone remains reliable and controlled.</p>



<p>The included DJI RC2 controller adds to the seamless experience: Its <strong>built-in 5.5-inch HD screen</strong> provides a clear, responsive view of your live feed, removing the need to rely on a smartphone. This makes flying more intuitive and lets you focus on framing the perfect shot rather than juggling devices.</p>
<p>Content creators will also appreciate the drone’s flexibility when it comes to framing. With support for both landscape and vertical shooting, it’s easy to tailor footage for different platforms. From cinematic YouTube videos to vertical clips optimized for Instagram Reels or TikTok, the DJI Mini 5 Pro drone can adapt to how and where you want to share your work.</p>
<p>Extended flight time is another major advantage. With three batteries included, you can spend hours in the air across multiple flights, rather than cutting sessions short. When it’s time to recharge, the two-way charging hub keeps downtime to a minimum.</p>
<p>Add in generous internal storage and fast wireless transfers to your phone, and the DJI Mini 5 Pro Fly More Combo becomes an all-in-one solution for aerial photography. At its current discounted price, it’s a smart investment for beginners and a capable upgrade for experienced pilots.</p>
