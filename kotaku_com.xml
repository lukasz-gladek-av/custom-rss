            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>A newly discovered bug in <a href="https://kotaku.com/borderlands-4-the-kotaku-review-bugs-pc-performance-ending-gearbox-ps5-2000627149">open-world looter shooter <em>Borderlands 4</em></a> is letting players use a specific legendary gun to fling themselves across large sections of the game’s map. It looks wild and could be useful for speedrunners. But Gearbox is watching the glitch and might, if needed, fix it to avoid technical problems.</p> <p>On September 19, Twitch streamer and content creator Bahroo shared a video of himself playing <a href="https://kotaku.com/12-tips-borderlands-4-guide-help-better-loot-gold-keys-side-quests-tricks-2000626554"><em>Borderlands 4</em></a> while pulling off a technique known online as “Cricket Jumping.” The bug relies on a legendary handgun known as the “Noisy Cricket” and its powerful kick, which sends players flying backward. The gun itself is a reference to the <a href="https://meninblack.fandom.com/wiki/Noisy_Cricket">tiny gun with the same name seen in the ’90s sci-fi comedy film<em> Men In Black</em>.</a> Normally, this isn’t the most useful trait. But if you tab out or pause the game at the right time while charging up a shot with the Noisy Cricket, you can send yourself flying for miles. It’s wild to watch in action.</p>  <p>Cricket Jumping has been a known bug since at least September 16, <a href="https://youtu.be/g9qh_8N4QU0">as demonstrated in this short video</a> uploaded by YouTube user Platinum. But it wasn’t until Bahroo and other bigger streamers and creators began sharing videos of the technique that it caught on more and became more publicly known. And that attention eventually got Cricket Jumping spotted by <em>Borderlands 4′</em>s creative director Graeme Timmins. While you might assume someone from Gearbox would not be happy about this bug, Timmins seemed open to not patching it out, provided it doesn’t break the game.</p>

 <p>“I’ve got my eye on this,” replied Timmins to a video of the bug on Twitter. “My only worry is streaming issues or if this introduces instability. Not out to ruin people’s fun, but can’t have it cause tech issues. For now, tho, not going to do anything until proven issues arise.”</p> <p>So for now, it seems like Gearbox is going to let people Cricket Jump all around Kairos, assuming it doesn’t ruin the game for other players or introduce some nasty, less cool bug. Besides, I imagine <a href="https://kotaku.com/borderlands-4-pc-performance-dlss-frame-gen-pitchford-gearbox-steam-2000625765">Gearbox has a lot more to fix in <em>Borderlands 4</em></a> right now, like <a href="https://kotaku.com/borderlands-4-performance-fps-drops-stutter-ps5-pro-xbox-console-restart-gearbox-2000626487">horrible console performance problems</a>, and isn’t too concerned about a silly super jump bug.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Our first trailer for the next <em>Star Wars</em> movie <a href="https://kotaku.com/mandalorian-grogu-trailer-disney-boycott-2000627542">has arrived</a>&nbsp;and it looks incredibly forgettable. Fans are picking apart a 90-second clip of <em>The Mandalorian and Grogu</em> and mourning the franchise’s loss of visual identity. Is Disney’s take on the sci-fi galaxy far, far away cooked, or is this just how a movie about a dude in a helmet and a green puppet is going to look in the year 2025?</p> <p>Is the <em>Mandalorian and</em> <em>Grogu</em> trailer bad-looking? Yes. Is that sort of what I expected from the post-Disney+ entertainment industrial complex in the age of streaming? Also yes. Does any of this matter? Not to me. I did not stick around through three increasingly mediocre seasons of <em>The Mandalorian</em> for the second coming of Akira Kurosawa. I am coming to the movie to see some weird-looking aliens, goofy robots, and flashy lasers blow some stuff up. Even by those standards the teaser was a C minus, but the latest example of <em>Star Wars</em> mediocrity has some fans fully crashing out.</p> <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">I don’t want to sound negative but this trailer makes the movie feel more like a filler episode of the TV show.

My favorite, though, is this summary: “50% of the comments: Jimmy Kimmel and the Empire, 49.9% of the comments: This Looks Like Season 4, 0.01%: Somehow Razor Crest returned!” Folks on Reddit are taking things more in stride. “Kinda looks like it’s just supposed to be fun, which I totally dig,” reads <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/TheMandalorianTV/comments/1nnlzpw/the_mandalorian_and_grogu_official_trailer/">the top reaction</a>. “Like if it’s just a movie length episode I’m down with that.”</p>

 <p>That is about what I expected as well. I think it’s partly a testament to how much the Disney <em>Star Wars</em> shows, even when they’re bad, have looked like big-budget productions that <em>The Mandalorian and Grogu</em> movie just looks like a feature-length episode. I also think people are being a bit dramatic in rushing to judge a teaser for a film about back-bench characters who didn’t exist until just a few years ago against the most iconic stills across decades of original movies. It also feels like people have forgotten that Jon Favreau is directing.</p> <p>What are the most memorable shots that come to mind from <em>Elf</em>, <em>Zathura: A Space Adventure</em>, and <em>Cowboys &amp; Aliens</em>? I’ll wait. He’s not that type of director. The most visually arresting 60 seconds of footage he ever recorded was himself cooking a grilled cheese in <em>Chef</em>. He brings other virtues to his filmmaking, most of which are probably hard to get across in a 90-second teaser where almost no one talks. That is not a defense of <em>The Mandalorian and Grogu</em>, but it’s a point worth keeping in mind when judging the pre-release marketing for a movie about a stoic cowboy and his green muppet baby that’s literally called <em>The Mandalorian and Grogu</em><em>.&nbsp;</em></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Tomorrow, Jimmy Kimmel will return to host his late-night show after it was <a href="https://kotaku.com/jimmy-kimmel-fallon-colbert-stewart-trump-kirk-2000627249">“indefinitely” put on hold on September 17</a> by Disney following remarks he made about Charlie Kirk in the wake of the conservative commentator’s assassination earlier this month. The decision prompted a large amount of backlash from fans, actors, and comedians, and led to calls for a Disney boycott.</p> <p>On September 22, Disney and ABC confirmed <a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/tv/tv-news/jimmy-kimmel-live-return-abc-1236374942/">via a statement shared with the press</a> that <em>Jimmy Kimmel Live!</em> will return to the air following a near-weeklong hiatus that came after the comedian spoke about Kirk’s assassination and his thoughts on how some Republican politicians, including President Trump, and other conservative commentators acted in the days that followed the shooting.</p> <p>“Last Wednesday, we made the decision to suspend production on the show to avoid further inflaming a tense situation at an emotional moment for our country,” said Disney and ABC in a statement. “It is a decision we made because we felt some of the comments were ill-timed and thus insensitive. We have spent the last days having thoughtful conversations with Jimmy, and after those conversations, we reached the decision to return the show on Tuesday.”</p>

 <p>Since last week, <a href="https://kotaku.com/jimmy-kimmel-mark-hamill-pedro-pascal-marvel-star-wars-2000627564">Marvel and<em> Star Wars</em> actors like Pedro Pascal and Mark Hamill have spoken out publicly</a> against Disney and ABC’s decision to suspend production on Kimmel’s popular late-night talk show after he joked that many members of the “MAGA gang” hit a new “low” after many of them tried to “score political points” from Kirk’s assassination. He also directly called out Trump’s awkward and cold reaction to Kirk’s death when responding to reporters’ questions about how he was holding up. At no point, <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/what-jimmy-kimmel-said-late-night-show-charlie-kirk-2025-9">as documented extensively</a>, did Kimmel joke about Kirk’s death. Yet that didn’t matter. FCC Chairman and Trump loyalist Brendan Carr threatened to investigate ABC and pull its broadcast licenses over Kimmel’s comments. So Disney Entertainment Co-Chairman Dana Walden and CEO Bob Iger <a href="https://deadline.com/2025/09/jimmy-kimmel-decision-disney-dana-walden-bob-iger-1236547651/">capitulated instantly and shut the show down</a>.</p>

 <p>“Giving a bully your lunch money is only a temporary down payment for future bullying,” said Hamill.&nbsp; “We ALL need to step up for the First Amendment. By-the-way, for the record, this ex-Disney employee finds Jimmy Kimmel very talented and funny.”</p>

 <p><a href="https://x.com/Michael_Eisner/status/1969088566098870363">Even former Disney CEO Michael Eisner</a> condemned Iger and Disney’s handling of the Kimmel situation, posting on Twitter: “The ‘suspending indefinitely’ of Jimmy Kimmel immediately after the Chairman of the FCC’s aggressive yet hollow threatening of the Disney Company is yet another example of out-of-control intimidation.”</p> <p>Meanwhile, thousands of people shared screenshots of them canceling their Disney+ subscriptions and threatening to boycott future Marvel and <em>Star Wars</em> movies and shows. In response, Disney seemingly tried to use a trailer for <a href="https://kotaku.com/mandalorian-grogu-trailer-disney-boycott-2000627542"><em>The Mandalorian and Grogu</em>&nbsp;to distract people</a> and change the online conversation. But that didn’t seem to work. Now, after all that, Disney has reversed course and is, for the time being, not letting Carr and Trump push them around. We’ll see how long that lasts and if Kimmel is forced to apologize on air or not when his show return’s Tuesday night on ABC.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><span>I see so much slop on my </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/tiktok-us-ban-supreme-court-date-bytedance-china-1851715772"><span>TikTok</span></a><span> feed these days that most of it doesn’t faze me. However, for the past week or so, I’ve seen ads promoting what are very clearly AI-generated Christmas ornaments featuring famous characters in situations that their respective IP holders would probably never approve of. I can’t unsee these horrors, so now, I’m making it your problem. You ever seen Belle from </span><i><span>Beauty and the Beast</span></i><span> making an ahegao face as she gets spanked over Beast’s knee? Do you know what the Grinch looks like on his knees, worshipping a mystery Grinch lady’s uncomfortably caked-up rear-end? Well, it’s too late to turn back now. Look at it:</span></p> <figure id="attachment_2000627642" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000627642"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000627642">©Homacus</figcaption></figure> <p><span>These monstrosities come courtesy of </span><a href="https://homacus.com/collections/couple-ornaments"><span>Homacus</span></a><span>, a personalized gift shop that lets you print the names of yourself and your significant other on a “naughty” Christmas ornament featuring beloved characters like </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/kingdom-hearts-4-screenshots-mickey-sora-release-date-1851780809"><span>Mickey and Minnie Mouse</span></a><span>, </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/shrek-5-first-teaser-cast-zendaya-myers-diaz-trailer-1851766800"><span>Shrek and Fiona</span></a><span>, </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/lego-batman-legacy-dark-knight-arkham-new-game-2000618481"><span>Batman and Catwoman</span></a><span>, and many more that I doubt Disney, DC, and the numerous other rights holders signed off on. But hey, I’m open to being wrong, so I did reach out to Homacus for comment on the matter and will update the story if we hear back. Whatever the case, the company is very boldly paying for ads to make innocent bystanders like me very, very aware these ornaments exist. Think of all the poor bastards trying to scroll TikTok in peace who saw Jack Skellington tossing Sally’s salad. We already get enough psychic damage on the internet, and now we’re dealing with this?</span></p>   <p><span>The whole thing reeks of Facebook ad core shit that sites sell to boomers who think referencing anything sexual outside the bedroom is scandalous. It’s the type of pent-up sexual frustration that reminds you there are couples out there who rarely see each other naked, so having things like this hanging off their Christmas tree is as raunchy as it gets. I don’t care what debauchery is happening behind closed doors; just don’t make me look at </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/minecraft-movie-lava-chicken-jockey-easter-egg-game-1851786345"><i><span>Minecraft </span></i><span>creepers</span></a><span> smacking each other’s dumpies.&nbsp;</span></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Despite a trade war and rising inflation, the <a href="https://kotaku.com/valve-steam-deck-pc-console-switch-horizon-zero-dawn-re-1848628507">three-year-old Steam Deck</a> hasn’t gone up in price yet. In fact, it just got a pretty major discount. The $400 LCD model will be 20 percent off for the 2025 fall Steam sale. That makes it significantly cheaper than just about every other current-gen gaming device on the market right now, including the 8-year-old Nintendo Switch. It also puts some needed pressure on new PC gaming handhelds launching this holiday.</p> <p>The Steam Deck 256GB LCD model will be <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/steamdeck">$320 starting September 22</a>. That’s essentially what the refurbished model, currently out of stock, usually costs. The 512GB OLED model is still $550 and the 1TB OLED is still $650 (they come with slightly bigger screens, a higher refresh rate, and better battery life). This week-long discount leads into the Steam Autumn Sale which will kick off next week on September 29 and run until October 6.</p> <p>It’s not a bad deal at all for one of the most versatile gaming handhelds around. It might just be Valve clearing out old inventory as it phases out the older LCD models entirely, but it comes as every other platform squeezes players more and more at the checkout line. The Xbox Series X/S just got its second price hike this year, the PS5 all-digital is now $100 more than it was at launch, and even the original Switch recently went from $300 to $330. At this rate, it’s hard not to feel like the $450 Switch 2 might not be far behind.</p> <p>Then there’s the Steam Deck’s competition in the PC gaming handheld race. We still don’t know how much the new <a href="https://kotaku.com/rog-xbox-ally-price-pc-gaming-handheld-asus-pre-order-2000622751">Xbox Ally Rog</a> will be, even though it’s less than a month away from launch. And the Legion Go 2, which costs <a href="https://kotaku.com/legion-go-2-price-specs-madden-curse-eagles-2000623447">up to $1350 at the high end</a> ($1,479 for the 2TB model), is both incredibly expensive and incredibly hard-to-get. Lenovo took so many pre-orders <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/LegionGo/comments/1nl3vxj/now_there_cancelling_preorders/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button">it’s already canceling some</a>. That all might be great for “<a href="https://pc.watch.impress.co.jp/docs/news/2045631.html">enthusiast gamers</a>” but it’s not likely to actually help grow the overall market for PC gaming or handhelds. There’s only an estimated <a href="https://substack.com/redirect/d49e77d2-93bb-48ce-b01b-168e092a9257?j=eyJ1IjoiN293Z2UifQ.yUVZMKoNk2BqBF9tq3iEKEd7X3capQ_E9zpEziCzGhc">5 to 7 million Steam Decks</a> out there in the world right now, and it’s by far the best-selling portable not made by Nintendo.</p>
