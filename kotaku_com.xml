He also confirmed that The Initiative, the team behind the<em> Perfect Dark </em>reboot, was being shut down. </p><p><em>“</em>We have made the decision to stop development of <em>Perfect Dark</em> and <em>Everwild </em>as well as wind down several unannounced projects across our portfolio. As part of this, we are closing one of our studios, The Initiative,” said Booty. </p><p>“These decisions, along with other changes across our teams, reflect a broader effort to adjust priorities and focus resources to set up our teams for greater success within a changing industry landscape. We did not make these choices lightly, as each project and team represent years of effort, imagination, and commitment.”</p><p>Booty told staff that if they were “directly affected” by the layoffs and studio shutdown, they could apply for other roles within Xbox and that HR would “provide support.” </p><p>The cancellation is part of a larger round of layoffs at Microsoft. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.seattletimes.com/business/microsoft/microsoft-to-lay-off-as-many-as-9000-employees-in-latest-round/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.seattletimes.com/business/microsoft/microsoft-to-lay-off-as-many-as-9000-employees-in-latest-round/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Around 9,000 people are reportedly losing their jobs</a></span>, with many Xbox employees affected by the cuts. Microsoft Gaming CEO Phil Spencer explained in a memo to staff that the layoffs “end or decrease work in certain areas of the business and follow Microsoft’s lead in removing layers of management to increase agility and effectiveness.”</p><p><em>Perfect Dark </em>was first revealed via a short teaser trailer back in December 2020.

The game looked great, with gorgeous visuals, a slick art style, and gameplay that seemed like a combination of <em>Deus Ex, Dying Light,</em> and the old <em>Perfect Dark</em> games. However, the gameplay trailer didn’t include a release date. And now it seems this cool-looking reboot won’t ever see the light of day. </p></div></div><br/><br/>https://kotaku.com/xbox-reportedly-cancels-that-cool-looking-perfect-dark-1851785531]]></content:encoded>

The latest furore is likely a momentary blip until developer NetEase fully unveils all the cosmetics releasing in <em>Marvel Rivals</em>’ third season, but as some of the skins leak out ahead of their announcement, Spider-Man fans are angry about the absence of one of the web slinger’s most iconic looks: the Symbiote Suit.</p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="196032" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="Kotaku Unboxes The Spider-Man 2 Limited Edition PS5" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="270" data-playlist="196032,195896,195358" data-current="196032"><div><p>Kotaku Unboxes The Spider-Man 2 Limited Edition PS5</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196032/196032_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196032/196032_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196032/196032_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196032/196032_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/21556.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>Even if you’re not paying attention, you’ve probably seen the Symbiote Suit at least a few times since its debut in the comics in the ‘80s. The black-and-white outfit is arguably Peter Parker’s most iconic alternate suit when he’s not wearing his trademark blue-and-red onesie. As the name implies, the look is the result of a symbiotic, goo-like alien lifeform taking over the hero, causing an internal struggle between Peter and the creature’s violent tendencies. Spider-Man’s black-and-white look has appeared in several adaptations, including video games like <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/marvel-spider-man-2-review-ps5-venom-miles-morales-1850929271&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/marvel-spider-man-2-review-ps5-venom-miles-morales-1850929271">2023’s <em>Spider-Man 2</em></a></span>, and 2007’s <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/spider-man-movies-ranked-tom-holland-spiderman-1851670709&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/spider-man-movies-ranked-tom-holland-spiderman-1851670709"><em>Spider-Man 3</em> film starring Tobey Maguire</a></span>. It would make a natural addition to <em>Marvel Rivals</em>, one fans are clamoring for, and it would probably sell like hot cakes, but NetEase has yet to announce it. What makes the current situation all the more peculiar is that some of the skins in the game’s upcoming battle pass that <em>have</em> leaked include Symbiote skins for several other characters who are not your friendly neighborhood Spider-Man.</p><p>Based on the leaked art posted on X (formerly Twitter) account Rivals_Leaks, we now know that Squirrel Girl, Rocket Raccoon, and Jeff the Land Shark will all be getting Symbiote skins as part of the battle pass. Those might read like gag picks, but they have <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://marvel.fandom.com/wiki/Venom_War:_It%27s_Jeff_Vol_1_1&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://marvel.fandom.com/wiki/Venom_War:_It%27s_Jeff_Vol_1_1" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">some basis in the comics</a></span>, each at some point <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://marvel.fandom.com/wiki/Rocket_Raccoon_(Earth-18197)&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://marvel.fandom.com/wiki/Rocket_Raccoon_(Earth-18197)" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">being overtaken by a Symbiote</a></span>. With the alien goop suit being an obvious theme this season, it’s only a matter of time before we see Spidey don the fit, right? <em>Right?</em> Possibly! Until we know for sure, however, Spider-Man fans are gonna crash out and/or vibrate with anticipation, if that’s okay with y’all.</p><p>Given how popular the suit is, it wouldn’t surprise me if <em>Marvel Rivals </em>made it a shop skin instead of putting it on the battle pass. That way, people can buy it outright for about twice as much cash. If, somehow, NetEase doesn’t add this skin during the Symbiote-themed Season 3, beginning July 11, I expect the internet to melt. I mean, hey, Spidey’s <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://x.com/MarvelRivals/status/1939791055991242879&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://x.com/MarvelRivals/status/1939791055991242879" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">already getting a new skin bundle this week</a></span>, so it’s entirely possible NetEase pushes it further down the pipeline so Peter doesn’t get too greedy.</p><p>.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://kotaku.com/marvel-rivals-season-3-symbiote-spider-man-rocket-jeff-1851785527]]></content:encoded>

And where can you get them? Here’s what you need to know about using the Proelium in your inventory.</p><h2 id="h792544"><a id=""></a>What is Proelium used for?</h2><p>Proelium is used to purchase additional variants and upgrades for cosmetic skins for both the player and weapons. These purchases can be either variants of a given skin, or additional upgrades that give new effects. At the moment, these seem to be mostly limited to skins of Mythic rarity, with some exceptions at lower rarities. You can see if a skin has variants or upgrades on the purchase screen for the cosmetic, or by going to the edit screen for a skin you already own.</p><h2 id="h792545"><a id=""></a>How do you use Proelium?</h2><figure id="" data-id="aec66e868729c4b9a6697958312c605a" data-recommend-id="image://aec66e868729c4b9a6697958312c605a" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A screenshot shows a gun skin in a shop.

" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>After purchasing a Mythic weapon or character cosmetic, right click or press Y/triangle while selecting it in your loadout menu. Once in here, you’ll be able to see the variants and upgrades you can purchase.</p><p>The best example is a cosmetic from the open beta, the Deadly Harvest Jackhammer skin. Once you purchase this, you also will gain access to three additional variants of the skin, which you can unlock for 10 Proelium each. These don’t change the skin drastically, but give it some new colors as a way to further your own expression–and flex that you spent money to get the Mythic skin.</p><p>In addition to variants, you can get upgrades that heighten the cool factor of your new cosmetic for 20 Proelium each. For instance, with the Jackhammer skin, you can get a new tracer for your gun that gives a unique look and sound to every bullet fired, and a death effect that makes your target vanish when they’re defeated.</p><p>Luckily, getting Proelium is the simplest part about the currency! There are two main ways: directly converting Splitcoin into it, or earning it through a battle pass. The Beta Pass offered 70 Proelium for players to earn, for example, though it’s unclear if this will be the case for future ones as well.</p><p>As for the Splitcoin conversion, you can select one of three options:</p><ul data-type="List" data-style="Bullet"><li>40 Proelium for 1,000 Splitcoin</li><li>100 Proelium for 2,000 Splitcoin</li><li>240 Proelium for 4,000 Splitcoin</li></ul><p>With those rates, if you haven’t exhausted the option yet, you’re better off buying the premium battle pass to get Proelium. And even if you have, you are probably better off waiting for the next battle pass and seeing how much Proelium you can get from it.</p><p><em>Splitgate 2 </em>is currently available on Steam, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series X/S.</p><p>.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://kotaku.com/splitgate-2-proelium-uses-worth-it-buy-upgrades-cosmeti-1851785508]]></content:encoded>

Because of its flexible gameplay mechanics, <strong>you can spend dozens of hours simply farming, going out into the wilds, mining resources, and killing monsters for drops without advancing the story all that much.</strong></p><figure id="" data-id="06471aa50c9fa8d41dca10cfb4e57a02" data-recommend-id="image://06471aa50c9fa8d41dca10cfb4e57a02" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A character builds a well." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A character builds a well." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Marvelous / George Yang / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="06471aa50c9fa8d41dca10cfb4e57a02" data-recommend-id="image://06471aa50c9fa8d41dca10cfb4e57a02" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A character builds a well." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>However, it’s worth balancing your time between farming and going further into the story as you’ll receive new tools to tend to your farm. These can help expedite your process and make things easier.</p><p><strong>A full playthrough at a normal pace while engaging with the side activities like farming and hanging out with villagers will take about 40 hours to complete.</strong> <em>Guardians of Azuma </em>is a meaty game with plenty of content that rivals modern Japanese RPGs.</p><p>You can also max out the bond levels of your villagers and companions to learn about their various backstories and even romance some of them (there are a total of 16 romanceable characters). Same-sex relationships are supported, too. So whether you choose to play as the female protagonist Kaguya or the male protagonist Subaruru, you’re not short of any options.</p><p>Completionists are looking upwards to more than 120 hours in order to see everything that <em>Guardians of Azuma </em>has to offer.</p><figure id="" data-id="5622d029026e046c61823b5cd1862bcb" data-recommend-id="image://5622d029026e046c61823b5cd1862bcb" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A chracter aims a bow and arrow at a monster." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A chracter aims a bow and arrow at a monster." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Marvelous / George Yang / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="5622d029026e046c61823b5cd1862bcb" data-recommend-id="image://5622d029026e046c61823b5cd1862bcb" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A chracter aims a bow and arrow at a monster." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p><em>Rune Factory: Guardians of Azuma </em>launches on June 5 for the original Nintendo Switch, Switch 2, and Windows PCs.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://kotaku.com/rune-factory-guardians-of-azuma-how-long-story-farming-1851785504]]></content:encoded>
