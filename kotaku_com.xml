              <p>For some reason, Nintendo decided to hold <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2YywtBYAaw">a “Direct”</a> presentation on a Sunday about the upcoming <em>Super Mario Galaxy Movie</em>. In it, we get a new trailer showcasing a few new <em>Mario&nbsp;</em>characters joining the cast in the sequel, though we didn’t get any confirmation on whether big celebrity actors are voicing them like they are rest of the crew. Yoshi and Birdo will both make their cinematic debut in the movie when it premieres on April 1.</p> <p>The trailer opens with Mario and Luigi investigating a pipe that apparently has some kind of monster trapped inside. The two activate their Fire Flowers and get ready for a fight, only to find that there’s no monster in there, just a scared little dino guy. Aww. Thus begins the beautiful onscreen friendship between the Brooklyn plumbers and a prehistoric sidekick that eats baddies and poops them out into eggs.&nbsp; Though this is the first official reveal of the character, we saw what he would look like back in November <a href="https://kotaku.com/your-first-look-at-yoshi-in-the-mario-galaxy-movie-comes-from-a-box-of-cookie-dough-2000642406">after a cookie dough box revealed his movie look early</a>.</p>

  <p>We also see Birdo and Peach fighting in a brief action montage, but it’s a blink-and-you’ll-miss it shot, so there’s not much to glean from it just yet. Nevertheless, the cast of characters for the second <em>Mario</em> movie is growing pretty substantially, with Bowser Jr. and Rosalina also joining, <a href="https://kotaku.com/mario-galaxy-movie-trailer-rosalina-bowser-jr-direct-2000643447">as revealed back in the first trailer last year</a>. We even see a glimpse of Baby Mario and Baby Luigi in this latest tease, but it’s unclear if those will be distinct characters or just some kind of transformation state that the brothers go through during their next adventure.</p> <p>At the end of the direct, Illumination CEO Chris Meledandri said that all animation on the film is complete, and it has officially entered post production, focusing on sound design and finishing up the score. Does that mean it’s too late for them to fix whatever the hell is going on with those <a href="https://kotaku.com/super-mario-galaxy-movie-bowser-jr-eyes-bloodshot-2000643518">gross, bulging eyes on Bowser Jr.</a>? Probably. <em>Super Mario Galaxy Movie</em> isn’t out for another couple of months though, so who knows what other surprises Nintendo still has waiting in the wings.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/forget-dji-gopro-hero13-black-hits-its-lowest-price-as-amazon-offloads-waterproof-action-cameras-2000661985</link>

              <p>The GoPro HERO13 Black features 5.3K60 video, 27-megapixel photographs, and is waterproof, dustproof, and shockproof, with a ruggedized design for capturing professional-quality videos and casual social media posts. The camera has been engineered to withstand muddied, snowy, and wet environments, including up to 10 meters underwater, while continuing to record high-quality video that can be slowed down or repositioned. Additionally, the camera will allow you to continue shooting in harsher environmental conditions thanks to its Enduro battery, which provides longer recording times in extreme temperatures.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6865/">Go to Amazon to buy the GoPro HERO13 Black for $319, down from $430, for a $111 discount and a 26% price reduction.</a></p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6865/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>The perfect camera to capture all the action in your life</h2>
<p>With the GoPro Hero 13, you can record at 5.3K resolution at up to 60 frames per second, providing your video with greater clarity and detail than standard 4K or 1080P recordings. Additionally, if you’d like to capture both a video and a high-resolution photo, you can do so by pulling still images up to 24.7 megapixels directly from your video in the Quik application. When you’re trying to showcase some of the most exciting parts of your video, such as splashy moments, tricks, and quick movements, slow-motion recording allows you to slow down the action to approximately 13 times slower than real-time.</p>
<p>HyperSmooth 6.0 Stabilization smooths out bumps and small vibrations that may occur when the camera is shaken on trails, in the water, or in the snow. So, even the fastest runs appear smoother rather than choppy. In addition, a water-repellent lens cover helps quickly remove water droplets from the lens, thereby reducing glare in wet conditions. The ruggedized case is designed to protect against knocks, scrapes, and other forms of wear and tear from traveling between shoots.</p>



<p>The updated mounting system, combined with the camera’s small footprint, makes attaching it to new locations a simple process. Included with the purchase of the GoPro Hero 13 is a curved adhesive mount, a mounting buckle, and a thumbscrew, allowing for a basic setup to be attached immediately. Additionally, the Enduro lithium-ion battery is optimized for long runtime regardless of the environment’s temperature. Highlight Video Tools, along with Cloud Backup support, help streamline the process of converting your recorded sessions into completed and ready-to-post videos.</p>
<p>While additional mounting options and lens mods can be purchased separately, all the necessary accessories to get started with the camera are included in the box. These include a USB-C cable for charging and transferring data, a microSD card slot to select the storage capacity based on your intended usage. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6865/">Right now, you can buy the GoPro Hero 13 for $319, down from the typical retail price of $430</a>, and get rugged 5.3K video, enhanced battery life, and expanded creative options with various lens mods in a single, compact package.</p>
