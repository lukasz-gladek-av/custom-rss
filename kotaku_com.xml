              <p>Celebrities are just like you and me. They enjoy some video games, just like the rest of us. And back in 2002, Sony was thrilled that so many famous people really enjoyed playing the PlayStation 2. Sony was so excited, in fact, that the PlayStation maker compiled a large list of “celebrity testimonies” and shared it with the press via the company’s 2002 E3 Press Kit. And thankfully, <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/ultrabrilliant.xyz/post/3m22r6klg722i">as spotted by Devolver Digital PR manager Andy Kelly</a>, someone all the way back in 2016 uploaded this <a href="https://archive.org/details/PlayStation2CelebQuotes">press kit to the Internet Archive</a>. Now we can all enjoy it.</p> <p>I’ve formatted all of the testimonials below, with minimal editing or tweaks. Now you can easily enjoy all of these testimonials, some of which don’t seem like something Sony would actually want people to read or share. And yes, some of the people below are not great and are super canceled in 2025. Take a shot for each time that happens. (Don’t do that.)</p>

 <hr> <h2>Matthew Perry, actor, <em>Friends</em></h2> <p>“I used to have a social life, go on dates, go to dinner parties, have a job. Now all I do is sit in a big chair and play PlayStation 2. 1 never leave my house. My friends have wondered what happened to me. Howard Hughes must have had one of these.”</p>

 <h2>David Arquette, actor,<em> Scream 3</em></h2> <p>“PlayStation 2 is to the gaming world what the computer was to the typewriter. It’s not just an entertainment luxury, but a necessity.”</p> <h2>Hayden Christensen, actor, <em>Star Wars: Episode II: Attack of the Clones</em></h2> <p>“I just got [PlayStation 2] a few days ago, but I’ve been playing it non-stop; it’s a great system. The graphics are fantastic, I’ve never seen anything like it before.”</p>

 <h2>Luke Wilson, actor, <em>Charlie’s Angels</em></h2> <p>“Freedom from everyday life can only mean one thing – the arrival of PlayStation 2.”</p> <h2>Sandra Bullock, actress, <em>Miss Congeniality</em></h2> <p>“PlayStation 2 is the only place where I can legally explode things and not harm anyone.”</p>

 <h2>Chris Klein, actor, <em>American Pie II</em></h2> <p>“I’ve been playing game systems for a really long time, but once you go PlayStation 2 you can never go back. . .It’s the best system for sure.”</p> <h2>Jason Biggs, actor, <em>American Pie II</em></h2> <p>“I do play PlayStation. I have a PS2 console and it is awesome…It is amazing. PS one is still great, but the graphics and the concepts on PS2 are incredibly realistic…I had PS2 in my trailer for <em>American Pie II</em>. Me and the rest of the guys would get into some heated games.”</p>

 <h2>Jason Lee, actor, <em>Almost Famous</em></h2> <p>“[PlayStation 2] is the most amazing game I’ve ever played. Amazing graphics, too. The console looks like it’s straight out of <em>Blade Runner</em>!”</p> <h2>Justin Timberlake, singer, NSYNC</h2> <p>“I play PlayStation 2 all the time, not just on the road. The play action is really easy and has the best graphics.”</p>

 <h2>P. Diddy, rapper</h2> <p>“No doubt I am a [PlayStation 2] fan. My kids and I play together.”</p> <h2>Snoop Dogg, rapper/actor, <em>The Wash</em></h2> <p>“The rush to get the new PlayStation 2 is more out of control than the Cabbage Patch Kids. I want my music on there – I want it to be Snoop Dogg and PlayStation 2.”</p> <h2>Nick Carter, singer, Backstreet Boys</h2> <p>“I’ve been playing PlayStation 2 since it came out. I take it out on tour and play on the bus, in my hotel room and backstage before the shows. The graphics are totally awesome, and I like that I can use it to play DVDs, too.”</p> <h2>Vin Diesel, actor,<em> The Fast &amp; The Furious</em></h2> <p>“If I’m not playing Sony PlayStation or rereading a classic or watching a foreign film. . .my friends and I get on the Internet and find out who I’m dating, and it’s always hysterical.”</p>

 <h2>Tara Reid, actress, <em>American Pie II</em></h2> <p>“PlayStation is fun. It’s innocent and fun. It is nice to be kids and have a good time… I bring PlayStation 2 into my trailer on every movie I do.”</p> <h2>John Leguizamo, actor, <em>Moulin Rouge</em></h2> <p>“PlayStation 2 is the coolest thing ever. Forget my kids, this is MINE!”</p> <h2>Wayne Brady, comedian/actor, <em>Whose Line Is it Anyway?</em></h2> <p>“I love my PlayStation 2. I’m all over my PS2. . . I tour so much now doing my improv act, that it’s great because my wife doesn’t let me play games at home, so I play them in the hotel room.”</p>

 <h2>Seann William Scott, actor, <em>American Pie II</em></h2> <p>“I’ve never seen anything like it. . . I’ve played other games before but PlayStation 2 is just amazing.”</p> <h2>Shannon Elizabeth, actress, <em>American Pie II</em></h2> <p>“The PlayStation 2 is the best thing ever.”</p> <h2>Tom Green, actor, <em>The Tom Green Show</em></h2> <p>“They’ve all got Sony PlayStations and I don’t.” (On what he most values in his friends) “FINALLY, I’ve got my very own PS2″</p> <h2>Jimmy Fallon, actor, <em>Saturday Night Live</em></h2> <p>“The PlayStation 2 is sweet! The new Madden game sounds insane…I want to play it now. I’m also excited about playing over the Internet. If they make an Olympic game it will be awesome to actually play someone in China. Too much fun.”</p> <h2>Forest Whitaker, actor/director, <em>Waiting To Exhale</em></h2> <p>“I can’t wait to get the PlayStation 2 for my kids. They’re going to love it.”</p>

 <h2>Ashley Angel, singer, O-Town</h2> <p>“It’s midnight in Milwaukee and it’s 20 degrees outside and instead of being in a warm hotel room, Jacob, Erik and I are out playing PS2 in the tour bus.”</p> <h2>Howie Dorough, singer, Backstreet Boys</h2> <p>“We are all fans, but Nikki [Nick Carter] is the biggest. That is why I can’t beat him at <em>Who </em><em>Wants to Be a Millionaire</em> – I am trying to get that thing down.”</p> <h2>Dave Matthews, singer, Dave Mathews Band</h2> <p>“The band is so into PlayStation 2. I can’t imagine being on the road without it. Our lounge on the bus is dedicated to PlayStation 2.”</p> <h2>Danny Masterson, actor, <em>That 70’s Show</em></h2> <p>“The games are really cool – they’ve got good soundtracks on them and look very, very real…I’m at work and in between scenes we play video games. We should probably read more books, but PlayStation 2 is so darn good.”</p> <h2>Bill Bellamy, MTV VJ/actor,<em> The Brothers</em></h2> <p>“[PlayStation 2] is fascinating to see. The graphics are so incredible, so lifelike — it’s fast, it’s fun, it’s challenging, it brings people together. You feel like you’re really in the game. That’s the part that’s cool and that’s what people get excited about.”</p>

 <h2>Patricia Arquette, actress, <em>Little Nicky</em></h2> <p>“We can’t get enough of PlayStation 2 at our house.”</p> <h2>Lee Ann Rimes, singer</h2> <p>“It’s a total stress-buster at the end of a long day – it’s a lot of fun!”</p> <h2>Marlon Wayans, actor/writer, <em>Scary Movie</em></h2> <p>“It’s the truth. I played John Madden. . .one sack hit me so big, it broke my rib. You really feel like you’re playing the game. It’s the true experience. . .PlayStation 2.”</p> <h2>Rebecca Romijn-Stamos, actress,<em> X-Men</em></h2> <p>“When I saw my friend [playing PlayStation 2] I became determined to become as much of an expert as she is.”</p>

 <h2>Tom Arnold, actor, <em>Best Damn Sports Show Period, True Lies</em></h2> <p>“PlayStation 2 is so intense that when they play they don’t want to talk to anyone around them.”</p> <h2>Jermaine Dupri, So So Def Founder/Producer/ Recording Artist</h2> <p>“I am a die hard PlayStation 2 fan, I don’t like nothing else. But PlayStation is my favorite. . .You can play music, games, DVDs – there isn’t anything better.”</p> <h2>Billy Campbell, actor, <em>Once and Again</em></h2> <p>“It’s going to be a long time before anybody beats it…”</p> <h2>Brendan Fehr, actor, <em>Roswell</em></h2> <p>“In terms of graphics, it’s far superior to [the original] PlayStation. In between scenes, you see the players come out of dressing rooms, and there are little clips like you’re watching TV. It’s a lot of fun. . . PlayStation 2 is great because it plays both DVDs and games. . . and the graphics are so cool.”</p>

 <h2>Carmen Electra, actress/model,<em> Scary Movie</em></h2> <p>“I grew up playing video games. PlayStation 2 takes it to the next level.”</p> <h2>Jeff Probst, host of TV’s <em>Survivor</em></h2> <p>“When we did the first <em>Survivor</em>, I didn’t realize I’d have some downtime between challenges and Tribal Councils, but for <em>Survivor 2</em>, I was ready. I brought a PlayStation 2 as my luxury item. So, we’d finish Tribal Council, head back to base camp, toss in a game and start jammin’. It was a great way to get your mind out of your work and not a bad way to relieve some tension as well.”</p> <h2>Joey Fatone, singer, NSYNC</h2> <p>“I use PlayStation 2 because it is fun and has good graphics. It gives us something else to do on<br> the bus and helps pass the time while traveling from city to city. Got a PS2 in my car too like Chris [Kirkpatrick], and I play at least four to five hours a day. PS2 is the BOMB!”</p> <h2>Joshua Jackson, actor, <em>Dawson ’s Creek</em></h2> <p>“I can’t go to a [movie] set without my PlayStation 2 ”</p> <h2>Sean Stockton, singer, Boyz II Men</h2> <p>“I am a huge fan of [PlayStation 2’s] <em>Grand Theft Auto.</em> . . for adults like me it is the bomb.”</p> <h2>Donald Faison, actor, <em>Scrubs</em></h2> <p>“PlayStation 2 is everywhere – they’re always at the most happening spots. It is the coolest brand.”</p>

 <h2>Drew Lachey, singer, 98 Degrees</h2> <p>“I’m keeping [my PlayStation 2] in my bunk on the tour bus because I’m afraid I’ll play it too much at home and cause fights with my wife.”</p> <h2>Eddie Cibrian, actor, <em>Third Watch</em></h2> <p>“You are talking to a true PlayStation 2 fan. I can’t wait for <em>Tony Hawk 3</em> to come out…I play <em>Madden</em> all day long.”</p> <h2>Bryan McFayden, MTV VJ</h2> <p>“At MTV, a PlayStation 2 is never more than 30 feet away from where we’re taping.”</p> <h2>Erik-Michael Estrada, singer, O-Town</h2> <p>“<em>NCAA Gamebreaker 2001</em> for PS2 is the most incredible college football game ever. Since we’ve gotten the PS2 on the road we have not been getting any sleep on the bus.”</p> <h2>Jason Cerbone, actor, <em>The Sopranos</em></h2> <p>“I have a PlayStation 2 at home and play all the time. I am a big fan.”</p> <h2>Jeff Timmons, singer, 98 Degrees</h2> <p>“We’re going to test out all of the games for Sony and post our recommendations on our website.”</p> <h2>Justin Jaffe, singer, 98 Degrees</h2> <p>“PlayStation 2 is going to take over our football lounge on the bus.”</p> <h2>Kevin Richardson, singer, Backstreet Boys</h2> <p>“PlayStation 2’s <em>Madden 2002</em>, I am addicted to that game. I am addicted to football and loved to play in high school, but was not good enough to play college or professional ball. With <em>Madden</em>, I get to live out my fantasies on PlayStation 2.”</p>

 <h2>Lance Bass, singer, NSYNC</h2> <p>“I love my PlayStation 2 because it helps me to get rid of stress on and off the road.”</p> <h2>Michael Rosenbaum, actor, <em>Smallville</em></h2> <p>“The PlayStation 2 is more fun than my blow-up doll.”</p> <h2>Nick Lachey, singer, 98 Degrees</h2> <p>“I know we’re going to bum through the first PlayStation 2 unit on the first leg of the tour.”</p> <h2>Robert Horry, athlete, Los Angeles Lakers</h2> <p>“I am a big PlayStation 2 fan. I went to the launch party last season and it was the best party I went to and I had to come back and check out the anniversary party. I don’t play the basketball games because I get frustrated. The games won’t let me do moves that I know I can do in real life.”</p> <h2>John Salley, former athlete, Los Angeles Lakers</h2> <p>“My daughter and I compete [on PlayStation 2]. Whenever we get in a fight, we say ‘See you on PlayStation.’ It’s better than a spanking. Just spank them on PlayStation.”</p> <h2>Simon Rex, actor, <em>Jack and Jill </em>(2002 TV show)</h2> <p>“Incredible fast graphics that would make Mario run for the hills. If my friends thought I spent a lot of time on PlayStation, just wait until [PlayStation 2] comes out!”</p>

 <h2>Stefan Lessard, bassist, Dave Matthews Band</h2> <p>“People know when they can’t find me, I’m in my bunk playing PlayStation 2. It’s my saving grace on the road – but I love playing it at home too!”</p> <h2>Jimmy Kimmel, host, <em>The Man Show</em></h2> <p>“My son is eight years old and is hooked up like an IV to the PlayStation 2 — it keeps him busy.”</p> <h2>Adrien Brody, actor, <em>Dummy</em></h2> <p>“I don’t even have a TV, but I’m going to get one and go crazy with PlayStation 2.”</p> <h2>Vincent Pastore, actor, A<em>fter the Storm</em>, <em>The Sopranos</em></h2> <p>“I am a big PlayStation 2 fan. I am into it.”</p> <h2>Tia Carrere, actress, <em>Wayne’s World</em></h2> <p>“Actually, I have to admit to jumping to the head of the line in Canada to get a couple of PlayStation 2s for Christmas — I was part of the craze. Now I want one for me.”</p> <h2>Nick Stahl, actor, <em>The </em><em>Thin Red Line</em></h2> <p>“The PS2’s graphics are amazing. I can’t wait to own one of these. . .I’ll play it all the time.”</p> <h2>Norman Reedus, actor/model,<em> Gossip</em></h2> <p>“I love playing the PlayStation 2. It’s like meditation.”</p> <h2>Vincent Young, actor</h2> <p>“The sports games are addictive. I can’t put <em>Madden Football</em> down once I start playing. The graphics are so realistic – you can even see the hair on the players’ arms move.”</p> <h2>Catherine Bell, actress,<em> Jag</em></h2> <p>“The PlayStation 2 is amazing and it looks really cool. Plus, the graphics are incredible. I love the fighting games, especially <em>Tekken Tag</em>, because I find all these crazy combinations, and when I play against my husband I always win.”</p> <h2>Ashley Poole, singer, Dream</h2> <p>“Me and my dad play PlayStation 2 when I go home — I love it. I love it. Holly and I are the PlayStation 2 babies of Dream. On our bus we have all the games and love to play.”</p> <h2>Daphne Zuniga, actress, <em>Melrose Place</em></h2> <p>“My whole life, I’ve never liked video games, but after playing PlayStation 2, I have to get one…”</p> <h2>Debra Cox, singer</h2> <p>“I am a huge, huge, huge PlayStation fan. They are in every recording studio — how could you not be a fan?”</p>

            <title><![CDATA[This 2.5D Love Letter To Chrono Trigger And Other JRPG Classics Couldn’t Look Any More Perfect]]></title>
            <link>https://kotaku.com/threads-time-trailer-chrono-trigger-jrpg-sea-stars-2000630296</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/this-2-5d-love-letter-to-chrono-trigger-and-other-jrpg-classics-couldn%E2%80%99t-look-any-more-perfect.1312867/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Will<em> Threads of Time</em> be <a href="https://kotaku.com/sea-of-stars-game-impressions-review-switch-jrpg-indie-1850854165">the next<em> Sea of</em> <em>Stars</em>,</a> or instead another tedious JRPG homage that emulates the classics without being able to capture what really made them tick? That was my question when it debuted during <a href="https://kotaku.com/xbox-tgs-2024-tokyo-game-show-final-fantasy-game-pass-1851658415">last year’s Xbox Tokyo Game Show livestream</a>. But every time this indie game has resurfaced since, it’s looked better and better. It returned to TGS 2025 with yet another trailer perfectly calibrated to play on fans’ hopes and dreams for another great 16-bit homage to all-time greats like<em> Chrono Trigger</em>.</p> <p>The turn-based RPG with beautiful pixel art and an amazing 2.5D depth of field is being made by Canada-based Riyo Games and published by Humble Games. There’s a team of over 30 people working on it. We still don’t have a release date but it’s looking in better shape than some flashy projects that dazzle with trailers but fail to actually ship. I hope the team isn’t biting off more than it can chew, especially amid a tough funding environment for smaller indie developers and publishers, because everything in this trailer is exactly what I want from a <em>Chrono Trigger</em> spiritual successor:</p>

  <p>The time-travelling adventure spans millions of years, from a prehistoric past to a cyberpunk future. Turn-based combat takes place in a dynamic view with bespoke attack animations. There’s an overworld map, town hubs, and NPCs to chat up. You’ll recruit characters from different eras and unlock team combos for battle. Why are you doing all this, exactly? It sounds like you’re working for the Order of Time Knights to try and protect the integrity of the timeline or something. Also: cool boss fights.</p> <p><em>Threads of Time</em> is being developed in Unreal Engine 5 with hand-crafted 2D pixel art. I can’t stress enough how great the environments and characters look. If that can hold up over an entire 10-20 hour adventure it will be an impressive achievement, especially for the indie studio’s first project. 2023’s <em>Sea of Stars</em> was the last game to pull this trick off, selling like hotcakes and winning nods at The Game Awards that year (DLC <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/sabotagestudio.com/post/3lpmbdqu7w22w">released earlier this year</a>). Before that, there was 2021’s <a href="https://kotaku.com/eastward-the-kotaku-review-1847753920">incredible-looking <em>Eastward</em></a>. I hope <em>Threads of Time</em> can deliver something equally special in the next year or two. It’s currently only confirmed for PC and Xbox.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Call Of Duty: Black Ops 7 Shows Off Everything Coming To Multiplayer At Launch]]></title>
            <link>https://kotaku.com/cod-next-blops-7-wall-bounce-maps-tac-movement-2000630271</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-shows-off-everything-coming-to-multiplayer-at-launch.1312795/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Ahead of <em>Black Ops 7</em>‘s November 14 release date and the early access beta running from October 2 to 5<em>, Call of Duty </em>Next showed off some live footage from the latest entry in the long-running of the military shooter series. The game looks like a solid, speedy, competitive shooter that’s utilizing its futuristic setting for some war-themed sci-fi fantasy. So let’s jump into what stood out during CODNext.</p>  <h2><em>Black Ops 7</em> multiplayer looks tactile and fast</h2> <p>I don’t blame those who think all of these games look the same, but if you like a fast shooter with some interesting opportunities for gravity-defying tactics, you might want to check out footage from today’s event–especially if you’re a fan of&nbsp;<em>Black Ops 2</em>, to which <em>7</em> is intended as a spiritual successor.</p>

 <p>Set in the near future,&nbsp;<em>Black Ops 7</em> has some fancy tech that builds off the advanced movement techniques in&nbsp;<em>Black Ops 6</em>. Wall-jumping, sliding, tactical stance, it all combines very seamlessly in both the scripted sizzle reels and the actual gameplay shown off today.</p>

 <p>The wall-bouncing, which looks like it’ll owe&nbsp;<em>Titanfall&nbsp;</em>a royalty check, is particularly exciting as various streamers showed off how these techniques can be used for some vertically lethal plays and opportunities to get new, unexpected sight lines.</p>

 <h2><em>Black Ops 7</em> will ship with 18 maps, mostly focusing on 6v6</h2> <p>In what’s shaping up to be a healthy roster of maps,&nbsp;<em>BLOPS7 </em>will feature 16 6v6 maps, with 13 of those being brand new designs joined by three remakes of&nbsp;<em>BLOPS6 </em>maps. The remaining two maps are for 20v20 battles.</p> <p>During the beta, folks can jam on six of these maps, all of which are of the smaller, 6v6 variety. Map design in&nbsp;<em>BLOPS7 </em>is particularly focused on standard, three-lane construction. That tried-and-true design, however, might be just what allows the game’s advanced movement techniques to really let players mix things up.</p>

 <h2>Overclocking equipment</h2> <p><em>BLOPS7</em> will contain many of the usual loadout options we’ve long come to expect from&nbsp;<em>CoD</em>, but you’ll be able to further customize your class by “overclocking” lethal, tactical, field upgrades, and score streaks. Once unlocked, these let you equip two modifications in addition to the ordinary functions of the equipment. One such example shown off today was the Stim Shot, which lets you either cancel out enemy-induced debuffs&nbsp;or gain a speed boost when using it.</p>

 <h2>Weapon build sharing</h2> <p>In what stood out to me as one of the coolest features in&nbsp;<em>BLOPS7</em>, folks will be able to quickly share weapon builds with each other by way of a simple code the game generates when you finish a specific setup. This should make it pretty easy to just grab an effective meta build and jump into a match.</p>

 <h2>Season one aims to be the ‘biggest’ in <em>BLOPS</em> history</h2> <p>Though&nbsp;<em>BLOPS7</em> has a pretty sizeable stock of maps to choose from at launch, Treyarch announced today that seven additional multiplayer maps will join the game over the course of its first season, with six of them for the 6v6 mode. Ranked play will arrive in season two.</p> <h2>Nuketown returns</h2> <p>Looking like it came straight out of Bethesda’s&nbsp;<em>Fallout</em> games, the end of the multiplayer reveal showed off a couple of shots of fan-favorite&nbsp;<em>CoD</em> map Nuketown. Check it out:</p> <figure id="attachment_2000630311" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000630311"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000630311">© Screenshot: Activision / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p>Nuketown is expected to arrive “soon” after&nbsp;<em>BLOPS7</em>‘s launch.</p> <hr> <p>All in all, the big takeaway from CODNext is that if fast-paced, competitive shooters are your thing, <em>BLOPS7</em> is looking pretty solid.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>EA has released a content roadmap for <a href="https://kotaku.com/new-battlefield-6-trailer-direct-attack-against-call-of-duty-celeb-trailer-skins-ea-2000629910"><em>Battlefield 6</em></a> that outlines all the new goodies and free DLC players can expect during the online shooter’s first season.</p> <p><em>Battlefield 6</em>, EA’s next installment in the popular military sim series, is nearly here. The FPS arrives on October 10 on console and PC. But in 2025, games like <em>Battlefield</em> can’t just launch and be done. No, they need roadmaps! Promises of more content coming down the pipeline. <a href="https://www.ea.com/games/battlefield/battlefield-6/news/battlefield-6-season-1-roadmap-preview">And that’s just what’s been revealed,</a> with <em>BF6</em>‘s season one roadmap confirming two new maps are arriving in <em>BF6</em> before the end of the year, as well as new modes, guns, and more.</p> <p>As seen in the new roadmap shared on September 29, season one of <a href="https://kotaku.com/battlefield-6-framerate-fps-xbox-series-s-ps5-2000626043"><em>Battlefield 6</em></a> doesn’t start at launch. Instead, it begins on October 28, a few weeks later. The first season is being split into “phases” that will bring in new content every month for the rest of 2025.</p> <figure><figcaption>© EA</figcaption></figure> <h2>Phase One of <em>BF6</em>‘s first season</h2> <p>The first Phase is Rogue Ops, and it adds a brand new map: Blackwell Fields. This is a big map set in the California badlands, and it will support all modes as well as land and air vehicles. The first phase also adds Strikepoint, a new 4v4 mode all about “intense, small team tactical” combat. Squads fight over an objective across multiple rounds, but only have one life each round. Sounds tense. Not sure it’s something I’ll play, but different strokes, etc.</p>

 <p>Also being added in the first phase are an APC vehicle, a compact carbine rifle, a new sidearm, and some extra attachments for weapons.</p> <h2>Phase Two of <em>BF6</em>‘s first season</h2> <p>Phase two of <em>BF6</em>‘s first season kicks off on November 18 and adds a new map, Eastwood, which seems to be a bit smaller than Blackwell Fields. This new battlefield is also set in the United States and is located in a “sleepy, affluent suburb” next to a golf course. All modes supported, but it seems no jets will be available on this one, just helis. A new mode called Sabotage is being added in this phase, too. The new mode is another smaller one focused on 8v8 combat as teams try to destroy as many objectives as possible before time runs out. One team defends, the other attacks. Once again, not sure if this is what I want from <em>Battlefield</em>, but cool for folks who like it.</p>

 <p>Also being added in phase two: Battle Pickups. This is a returning feature from some past<em> Battlefield</em> games. Players will be able to find powerful and advanced weapons that can be picked up and used until they run out of ammo or you die and drop them. I’m excited to see how this might change up some maps.&nbsp; A new double-barreled pump shotgun, revolver, and attachment is also being added during this phase.</p>

 <h2>Phase three of <em>BF6</em>‘s first season</h2> <p>Finally, on December 9, phase three of the season arrives. EA says this is the last phase of the season. This phase doesn’t add a new map, but instead changes up an existing map. <em>BF6</em>‘s Empire State map, set in NYC, will temporarily be covered in snow during this phase of the season. According to the roadmap, this won’t simply be a fun cosmetic change, but will actually affect gameplay. There will be a new “Freeze” mechanic introduced on the snow-covered map that EA describes as a “gameplay modifier.” No other details yet.</p> <p>Meanwhile, the third and final phase will add an ice-climbing axe as a new melee weapon option, and a new limited-time “Ice Lock” even that will happen exclusively on the snowy Empire State map.</p> <hr> <p>Phew! That’s a lot of content and all of it is, assuming nothing gets delayed, arriving in the game’s first few months. I’ll be curious to see how much content future seasons include. Can we expect two maps and multiple guns in every season? That seems like a lot. But if the devs can pull it off, <em>Battlefield 6</em> might end up being one of the best entries in the series. And that might help distract people from the news that <a href="https://kotaku.com/ea-sale-saudi-arabia-madden-pif-jared-kushner-2000629829">EA is being bought up by Saudi Arabia’s prince and Jared Kushner’s investment firm</a>.&nbsp;<em>Battlefield 6</em> is out on October 10 for PS5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC.</p>
