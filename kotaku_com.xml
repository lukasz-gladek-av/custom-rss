              <p>If you play <i>Counter-Strike 2</i> and enjoy trading skins for financial gain, you’re either real happy right now or, um, quite the opposite. Valve recently pushed an update to the game’s controversial marketplace that appears to have wildly shifted the value of some folks’ inventories, gutting the worth of some players’ stockpiles of skins while skyrocketing that of others. It’s <a href="https://x.com/pricempire/status/1981369304252645391">a dramatic shift</a> triggering a nearly $2 billion decrease in value to the market.</p> <p>In an update that makes an otherwise ordinary <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/730/view/516350567072662004?l=english">assortment of tweaks</a>, Valve altered the way <i>Counter-Strike</i>’s skin game works (<a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/fps/counter-strike-2-community-left-in-shambles-along-with-steam-marketplace-after-valves-new-trade-up-update-turns-usd10-skins-into-usd1-000-skins-and-vice-versa-this-update-has-made-some-collectors-very-rich/">h/t <i>GamesRadar</i></a>). The update allows folks to “trade up” what were previously seen as borderline worthless cosmetics, referred to as “red” by the community. These skins were previously worth around $10, but as of the new changes, folks can trade them up for skins worth four digits. That’s quite the shift.</p>

 <p>Turmoil ensued as these changes rocked the skin market. <a href="https://x.com/ThatBoyAqua/status/1981167900900909382">One player lost $1400</a> “in the span of 30 minutes” as the changes mucked up the value of their inventory. Of course, as such things go, others gained a ton of money, <a href="https://x.com/Serifaz_/status/1981167366689222980">sharing screenshots</a> of the massive jump in value of their inventory.</p> <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">*formerly $10 skins lmao <a href="https://t.co/XeBcWqJ03O">pic.twitter.com/XeBcWqJ03O</a></p> <p>— Serifaz 🌸 (@Serifaz_) <a href="https://twitter.com/Serifaz_/status/1981167366689222980?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 23, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <p>“At this point just go and gamble at a casino 😂” reads another post. But perhaps the most ridiculous shift in value was @smileybeef’s now nearly four-million-dollar (yes, you read that right) batch of “worthless red skins.” “How do I explain this to the IRS?” they said. To which <a href="https://x.com/0scarrrrrrrrr/status/1981220176012967986">one user replied</a> “Can you please launder it harder by buying me a Steam Deck?” <a href="https://x.com/bigballs232/status/1981189348071768429">Another chimed in</a> saying “everytime I refresh the market they get more expensive some are at like 3600%.”</p> <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">how do I explain this to the IRS <a href="https://t.co/Cg7ldLw23U">pic.twitter.com/Cg7ldLw23U</a></p> <p>— psp1g (@smileybeef) <a href="https://twitter.com/smileybeef/status/1981141120051781834?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 22, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <p>I believe the technical term for this kinda stuff is “fucking nuts.”</p>

              <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-legends-za-mega-starmie-patrick-star-jokes-2000636057"><span>Mega Starmie</span></a><span>, my new sleep paralysis demon, started out as one of the most disappointing Mega Evolutions introduced in </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-legends-za-review-switch-2-bugs-performance-2000637719"><i><span>Pokémon Legends: Z-A</span></i></a><span>. The ethereal, alien-like starfish is one of the original 151 Pokémon and a longtime favorite among many fans. Folks had been asking Game Freak for a Mega Evolution for years, and numerous cool fan art concepts have been circulating on the internet for a long time, dating back to before </span><i><span>Legends: Z-A </span></i><span>was announced. What we got, however, is one of the goofiest-looking new forms in the game, one that many deemed unfitting of the original Pokémon’s mysterious design. However, after a lot of immediate backlash, Mega Starmie has reached the “so bad it’s good” status that Game Freak probably intended.</span></p>   <p><span>Mega Starmie’s big change is that it grows in size and its extremities become long enough that it can imitate human movement. So this gorgeous, jewel-wearing starfish turns into a freaky gremlin that runs around the battlefield like it’s in a Hanna Barbera cartoon. I admit, I hated its design when I first saw it. I’m not sure I’d say I’ve come around on it, but I can’t deny that it was an absolute beast during my playthrough that wiped the floor with so many of my foes’ teams. It was helpful that when it underwent this transformation, it was able to use its creepy-crawly legs to get across the battlefield more quickly, since its slow movement speed is one of its standard form’s weaknesses. And now that the initial shock is wearing off, players are starting to see the absurdity of Mega Starmie as endearing instead. It’s a meme Pokémon, but its human-like proportions have made it easy to graft onto just about anything.</span></p> <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">Mega Starmie containment breach<br>made in <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/blender?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#blender</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/b3d?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#b3d</a> <a href="https://t.co/AjcGqSD01j">pic.twitter.com/AjcGqSD01j</a></p> <p>— cgchefs (@cgchefs) <a href="https://twitter.com/cgchefs/status/1979677950598643881?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 18, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">When the fajitas come out sizzlin <a href="https://t.co/fq3ASwVALs">pic.twitter.com/fq3ASwVALs</a></p> <p>— DOMROM (@DomRomArt) <a href="https://twitter.com/DomRomArt/status/1980829381846298962?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 22, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="ja" dir="ltr">「待ちなさぁ～い！」 <a href="https://t.co/FRcVlWBiRE">pic.twitter.com/FRcVlWBiRE</a></p> <p>— いとた (@itota_art) <a href="https://twitter.com/itota_art/status/1980605381534777800?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 21, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="und" dir="ltr">Gm! <a href="https://t.co/8fnH1M7heO">pic.twitter.com/8fnH1M7heO</a></p> <p>— Pokémon Daily Post💫 (@PokeDailyPost) <a href="https://twitter.com/PokeDailyPost/status/1980544589908844591?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 21, 2025</a></p></blockquote>    <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="ja" dir="ltr">入浴中のメガスターミーのラテアート<a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/pokemon_LA?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#pokemon_LA</a> <a href="https://t.co/5sZJF12j8R">pic.twitter.com/5sZJF12j8R</a></p> <p>— じょーじ (@george_10g) <a href="https://twitter.com/george_10g/status/1979868926919291357?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 19, 2025</a></p></blockquote>    <p><span>Yeah, it might not be the Mega Evolution anyone expected, but it got people talking, and now Mega Starmie has somehow become a breakout…star…from </span><i><span>Legends: Z-A</span></i><span>.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/elden-ring-switch-2-erderee-expansion-open-world-rpg-1851774222">The Switch 2 port of FromSoftware’s open-world RPG, </a><em>Elden Ring,</em> has been delayed from 2025 until sometime in 2026. In two different statements about the delay, the devs explained that the port needed more time to improve performance. When <em>Elden Ring Tarnished Edition</em> on Switch 2 was first seen by the public, many weren’t impressed by its frame rate.</p> <p>On October 23, <a href="https://x.com/ELDENRING/status/1981360180580217143">the official <em>Elden Ring</em> Twitter account announced</a> that<em> Elden Ring</em> on Switch 2 was no longer launching in 2025 and had been delayed into next year to give the devs more time for “performance adjustments.”</p> <p><span>“While development on <em>Elden Ring</em></span><span><em> Tarnished Edition</em> continues wholeheartedly toward release,” posted the<em> Elden Ring</em> account, “we have decided to move the launch to 2026 to allow time for performance adjustments. We apologize to players looking forward to the game and thank you for your patience and support.”</span></p>

 <p><a href="https://x.com/fromsoftware_pr/status/1981359979119726764">Over on the official FromSoftware Twitter account</a>, the studio shared a lengthier message about the delay. Here’s the translated version of that statement:</p> <blockquote><p>Regarding the Nintendo Switch 2 <em>Elden Ring Tarnished Edition,</em> which was scheduled for release in 2025, we have determined that additional time is required for game performance adjustments, and we will therefore be changing the release to 2026. We sincerely apologize for any inconvenience this may cause to all users who have been looking forward to the release of this title. We will continue to make adjustments to deliver it in the best possible form, so we kindly ask for your understanding. Thank you very much for your patience.</p></blockquote> <p>Both statements make it clear that the open-world RPG, first released on PlayStation, Xbox, and PC in 2022, is struggling to run well on Nintendo’s Switch 2 console. This was clear when the game was demoed at Gamescom earlier this year, and footage showed it chugging horribly. <a href="https://kotaku.com/elden-ring-switch-2-framerate-footage-video-gamescom-2000618923">Bandai Namco reportedly even stopped people from recording footage</a> of the game to avoid it being posted online. <em>Nintendo Life</em> video producer Felix Sanchez, after playing <em>Elden Ring</em> on Switch 2, said: “It’s really bad, and I understand why they don’t want you to see this, because wowie zowie, it is terrible.” Looks like FromSoftware and Bandai Namco are going to keep tinkering on the port until next year. Hopefully, that helps it run better when it finally launches.</p>

              <p>Halloween is right around the corner, and one of the best ways to amp up your spooky nights (or any weekend, literally) is with a powerful outdoor speaker.

<h2>Water, Dust, and Drop Resistant</h2>

You can toss it in your backpack or just throw it over your shoulder using the detachable strap and get going. But despite the compact size, the speaker packs serious power. It pushes out an impressive 50W of sound with bass as deep as 56Hz. The BassUp 2.0 and DSP tech come together to deliver an immersive experience where all the highs and lows are captured exceptionally well.

<p>As for the battery life, you’re looking at up to 16 hours of playback on a single charge. That’s more than enough for a whole night of jamming. And for when you need even bigger sound for larger gatherings, you can easily pair two of these using the TWS mode.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4949/">Some other useful extras include Voice Amplifier, Emergency Alarm, and Buzz Clean mode, all accessible through the Soundcore app.</a> Altogether, the Soundcore Boom 3i offers impressive audio in a compact build.
