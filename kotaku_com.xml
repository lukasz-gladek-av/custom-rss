              <p>Microsoft first unveiled Windows 11 and its Pro version in 2021, and since then, the OS has become the go-to option for students, work professionals, creatives, gamers, and even casual users.</p>
<p>If you’ve been meaning to upgrade but don’t want to spend close to $200 on a license, we’ve found an affordable (and legitimate) route. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4452/">Stacksocial is currently offering a lifetime license for Microsoft Windows 11 Pro for just $15.</a> That’s a straightforward $184 discount on a one-and-done purchase. Once your purchase is successful, you will receive a digital license key via email, which you can redeem and activate on one device within 30 days.</p>

<h2>A Wide Range of Built-In Productivity Features</h2>
<p>For $15, you’re getting full access to one of the most user-friendly operating systems out there. It comes with a bunch of productive features, such as snap layouts, better voice typing, virtual desktops, and built-in AI with Copilot. Work professionals who take security and performance seriously will also appreciate BitLocker device encryption, Hyper-V virtualization, and Windows Sandbox – all of which make it easy to manage sensitive files and work remotely. Even better, there’s DirectX 12 Ultimate support to ensure a more immersive, high-performance gaming experience on compatible hardware.</p>
<p>However, there are some hardware and system requirements you need to meet before making the jump. Your device will need at least 4GB of RAM, 64GB of storage, a UEFI-based system with Secure Boot, and TPM 2.0 support. It also needs to be running Windows 10 or higher to complete the upgrade process. The display should be at least 9 inches diagonally with 720p resolution and 8 bits per color channel. Also, make sure you have a stable internet connection during the activation process to prevent any slowdowns.</p>



<p>Most modern devices already meet these specs, but we highly recommend double-checking before purchasing. It’s also important to note that this is a digital-only deal, and everything is handled via email. Once you’re all set, proceed with your purchase and use the activation code you receive to finish the process.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4452/">Overall, it’s a solid opportunity for anyone looking to switch to Windows 11 Pro without spending a lot</a>. This deal takes $184 off the usual $199 price, letting you upgrade for just $15. That’s a massive 92% discount, but it might not last long. Those looking to try Windows 11 Home can also get it for $15, down from $139 after an 89% discount.</p>

              <p>Shooters rely on a pretty fundamental thing: You aim your gun at something, you shoot, virtual bullets hit a target. Unfortunately for those diving into <i>Battlefield 6</i>, that’s not always working out according to plan. Bullets, it would seem, are sometimes just passing through targets. A hotfix was issued to deal with the problem for now, but what was going on?</p>      <p>In a pair of posts to X (<a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/battlefield/battlefield-6-dev-confirms-the-ghost-bullet-problem-is-very-real-amid-bloom-debates-it-is-commonly-observed-with-the-target-being-visibly-hit-but-no-damage-is-confirmed/">h/t <i>GamesRadar</i></a>), <i>Battlefield 6</i>’s principal game designer Florian (<a href="https://x.com/DRUNKKZ3">Drunkkz3</a>) stated that the issue seemed to involve the target being “visibly hit (blood splatters) but no damage is confirmed in the HUD.” The Battlefield Comms X account confirmed that it wasn’t a persistent issue, and it’s not a problem across all of the guns in the game’s arsenal. Only certain combos of attachments and weapons seem to trigger it. The devs issued a hotfix to deal with it.</p>

 <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">We're aware of reports of rare cases where bullets may not register damage correctly when hitting enemies.</p> <p>Following our investigation, we found this was related to certain weapon attachment combinations. A hotfix has been deployed to address known instances.</p> <p>We'll continue to…</p> <p>— Battlefield Comms (@BattlefieldComm) <a href="https://twitter.com/BattlefieldComm/status/1978400189476896968?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 15, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <h2>Ghost bullets don’t have to do with bloom or network issues</h2> <p>It’s a hotly debated and discussed topic: How virtual guns behave, how they recoil, how bullets get distributed in a given area. The recent <i>Battlefield</i> ghost bullet issue has kicked up some discourse around this, but <a href="https://x.com/DRUNKKZ3/status/1978415319002603851">according to Florian</a>, this present issue has nothing to do with bloom (where a recoil pattern grows in size the longer you’re shooting to simulate the struggle to keep a gun steady the longer you fire).</p> <p>Furthermore, networking bugs (or just a slow internet connection) can also result in some unwanted aiming mishaps. <a href="https://x.com/DRUNKKZ3/status/1978415667914096645">Florian also responded</a> to a comment wondering if the ghost bullets were the result of something as simple as someone having a crappy internet connection. “Some hit reg issues <i>can</i> happen as a result of bad internet or the game server performance being problematic,” he said, “but you will get performance icons at the top left when that happens.” The videos showing off the ghost bullets, notably, don’t show any such icons. So while we may not know exactly what <i>was </i>causing the ghost bullets, at least we know a few things that weren’t.</p>
