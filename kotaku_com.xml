Death can come fast in this kind of game, and since you lose all the stuff you’re carrying if you can’t make it out alive, loss feels particularly demoralizing.</p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="196131" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="The Top 10 Most-Played Games On Steam Deck: November 2023 Edition" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="328" data-playlist="196131,195189,196599" data-current="196131"><div><p>The Top 10 Most-Played Games On Steam Deck: November 2023 Edition</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196131/196131_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196131/196131_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196131/196131_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196131/196131_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/21668.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>This is especially true with something like <em>Escape from Tarkov</em>, in which survival mechanics like thirst and specific health conditions like bone fractures are accounted for. But even in more casual takes on the genre like <em>Call of Duty</em>’s shortly lived “DMZ” mode from <em>Modern Warfare 2</em> (2022), defeat often results in such an uphill battle in the next match that you’re usually too underequipped to be able to withstand even encounters with all but the most trivial AI, let alone fully equipped players. Many folks like this kind of a challenge, but it’s a niche crowd for sure. </p><p>But <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/marathon-gameplay-trailer-release-date-price-season-ps5-1851775940&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/marathon-gameplay-trailer-release-date-price-season-ps5-1851775940">today’s gameplay reveal of <em>Marathon</em></a></span> shows perhaps the most casual and approachable take on the genre yet. As someone who deeply loves the thrill that comes with this kind of game, I’m hopeful Bungie’s take on this hardcore genre opens the door for more folks to enjoy its highs without getting too mired in the lows. </p><h2 id="h653451"><a id=""></a>A class-based structure makes all the difference</h2><figure id="" data-id="2c84b988f542df25fab3ae3fc3e3c288" data-recommend-id="image://2c84b988f542df25fab3ae3fc3e3c288" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A screenshot shows a threeway split of the Glitch, Locus, and Blackbird Runners." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A screenshot shows a threeway split of the Glitch, Locus, and Blackbird Runners." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Bungie / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="2c84b988f542df25fab3ae3fc3e3c288" data-recommend-id="image://2c84b988f542df25fab3ae3fc3e3c288" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A screenshot shows a threeway split of the Glitch, Locus, and Blackbird Runners." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>As we learned from today’s gameplay reveal, players will select from one of six Runners at launch to jump into a map with. These sound very similar to classes in <em>Destiny</em> or even the abilities of characters in something like <em>Apex Legends</em> or <em>Rainbow Six Siege</em>. Today’s event showed off the four that will be playable during the game’s closed alpha period: </p><ul data-type="List" data-style="Bullet"><li><strong>Locus</strong>: A soldier-type character that’s “all about push-forward gameplay,” described during the stream as “the first one in” during combat scenarios.</li><li><strong>Blackbird</strong>: A “reconnaissance-based” Runner who focuses on spotting enemy threats for the team</li><li><strong>Glitch</strong>: An speedy “disruptor” who encourages fast, get-in, screw-with-enemies, get-out tactics</li><li><strong>Void</strong>: A stealthy Runner who can use smoke grenades and even go invisible with active camouflage</li></ul><p>Players will be able to find various implants and “Cores” to spice up their Runners, but given the inherent traits of each runner, such as Glitch’s double jump and Locus’ deployable shields, it sounds like you’ll always be able to deploy into a match with a baseline of defensive and offensive capabilities. Another exciting ability is Blackbird’s Ultimate, as <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.gamesradar.com/games/fps/marathon-hands-on-preview/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/fps/marathon-hands-on-preview/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>Gamesradar</em> observed in their preview,</a></span> which basically lets you interrogate a downed enemy to reveal their teammates’ positions.</p><p>But perhaps most importantly, these class dynamics provide a bit of a script that players should ideally follow during a match. See a Locus? You know that character likely has superior firepower. See a Void? You’ll know to expect some sneaky shenanigans. You’ll also know that those are the roles you’re expected to fill for your team, and you’ll be able to opt into that role at the start of the match, not <em>after</em> you’ve acquired the necessary gear to play as a tank, healer, or any other meta role. This establishes a clear expectation of what you should be doing during the match aside from just gathering loot and getting out alive.</p><figure id="" data-id="7086602e36ee470764f3ffbea0ca5b38" data-recommend-id="image://7086602e36ee470764f3ffbea0ca5b38" data-format="gif" data-width="800" data-height="450" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A gif shows a player highlighting enemy targets in a foggy area." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A gif shows a player highlighting enemy targets in a foggy area." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Marathon promises more than just shooting and looting in its gameplay loop.</figcaption><figcaption>Gif<!-- -->: <!-- -->Bungie / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="7086602e36ee470764f3ffbea0ca5b38" data-recommend-id="image://7086602e36ee470764f3ffbea0ca5b38" data-format="gif" data-width="800" data-height="450" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A gif shows a player highlighting enemy targets in a foggy area." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>It also means that you’ll spend less time scavenging things from the map for the sole purpose of being able to fill those roles after you’ve died. In extraction shooters in which you’re deprived of everything after death, it’s easy to get caught in a death spiral of being far too underequipped for subsequent matches. Writing for <em>IGN</em>, Travis Northup reflected on this <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.ign.com/articles/marathon-hands-on-preview-can-bungie-do-to-escape-from-tarkov-what-fortnite-did-to-pubg&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/marathon-hands-on-preview-can-bungie-do-to-escape-from-tarkov-what-fortnite-did-to-pubg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">in his preview of <em>Marathon</em></a></span>, wondering how that brutal feeling that “you’ll never catch a break” after repeat deaths and being deprived of useful loot will sit with folks who are new to the genre. </p><p>From my experience with the genre, <em>Marathon</em> sounds like it has a more manageable and capable baseline to fall back on after losing everything. Even though previews have stressed that <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.pcgamer.com/games/fps/after-thousands-of-hours-in-destiny-i-had-serious-concerns-about-bungies-marathon-reboot-but-now-ive-played-it-my-worry-isnt-whether-or-not-it-will-be-good/?utm_source=twitter&amp;utm_medium=social&amp;utm_campaign=dhtwitter&amp;utm_content=null&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/fps/after-thousands-of-hours-in-destiny-i-had-serious-concerns-about-bungies-marathon-reboot-but-now-ive-played-it-my-worry-isnt-whether-or-not-it-will-be-good/?utm_source=twitter&amp;utm_medium=social&amp;utm_campaign=dhtwitter&amp;utm_content=null" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">the default starter kit of weapons isn’t terribly powerful</a></span>, at least you won’t be deploying as a featureless, unarmored soldier bearing nothing but your bare fists if you’ve lost it all. You’ll have your Runner abilities and a sponsored loadout given to you before you jump into the next match. </p><p>While it’s clear <em>Marathon</em> will reward those players who stay alive the longest, being able to jump back in after dying with a set of useful abilities should make it way easier to dust yourself off and be of use to your team. Mix in the fact that the game features no survival mechanics like hunger or thirst, or an injury system that requires you to heal ailments to specific limbs, <em>plus </em>Bungie’s signature talents for creating shooters that feel responsive and satisfying to play, and <em>Marathon</em> might just be the extraction shooter’s chance to shine.</p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

But how many people will show up at launch for the studio behind <em>Halo </em>and <em>Destiny</em>?<em> Marathon</em>’s price will be a big factor there. The Sony-owned company still hasn’t said what the game will cost but it doesn’t sound like it will be free. </p><p> “The kicker here is that <em>Marathon</em> is going to launch as a premium product, meaning players will be asked to pay full price,” <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.gamespot.com/articles/bungies-marathon-is-a-polished-extraction-shooter-but-that-might-not-be-enough/1100-6530826/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/bungies-marathon-is-a-polished-extraction-shooter-but-that-might-not-be-enough/1100-6530826/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">reports <em>GameSpot</em></a></span>’s Tamoor Hussain, who recently went hands-on with the shooter. “Based on what I experienced and was told, it’ll have a battle pass, three maps (with a fourth arriving shortly after launch); fun but no-frills gameplay; a story that currently is all very vague in its nature and unclear in its implementation; and a character-progression system that doesn’t yet show signs of offering a meaningful sense of growth.”</p><p>Charging $7o for what’s described above, as <em>Forbes</em>’ <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://x.com/PaulTassi/status/1911124290545549611&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://x.com/PaulTassi/status/1911124290545549611" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Paul Tassi notes</a></span>, seems out of the question, and Bungie <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://x.com/MarathonTheGame/status/1911129962943549877&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://x.com/MarathonTheGame/status/1911129962943549877" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">later clarified that it won’t be doing</a></span> that stating, “<em>Marathon</em> will not be a full-priced title.” The most obvious guess from there is that <em>Marathon</em> will be $40. That seems to be the popular new hedge for premium games that need to reach a massive audience. That previously rumored number is what <em>Helldivers 2</em> was priced at last year. It’s also $10 less than what Bungie charged for <em>Destiny </em>2's big<em> The Final Shape</em> expansion that same year. </p><p>But $40 is also what Sony charged for <em>Concord</em>, the infamously failed hero shooter that so few people played that it was retroactively unreleased and fully refunded within two weeks of launch. A big talking point around that game was whether it would have had a better chance if it had been free-to-play, or at least free with PlayStation Plus. It’s impossible to know now, but that question will seemingly haunt every new live-service shooter <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/firewalk-studios-concord-ps5-sony-live-service-shutdown-1851684290&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/firewalk-studios-concord-ps5-sony-live-service-shutdown-1851684290">releasing in <em>Concord</em>’s wake</a></span>.</p><p>At the same time, Bungie has never given its games away for free before. Even <em>Destiny 2</em>, which currently has a free version, locks most of its content, especially newer stuff, behind a premium paywall. And most fans can understand why. Games like <em>Destiny 2</em>, or <em>Marathon</em> for that matter, don’t come cheap. With blockbusters like<em> Spider-Man 2</em> needing to sell over 7 million copies just to break even, microtransaction shops alone are unlikely to pay the bill unless your live-service game becomes a <em>Marvel Rivals</em>-sized hit overnight. And honestly, <em>Marathon </em>is looking a little too hardcore for that at the moment. </p><p>But unlike <em>Destiny 2</em>, <em>Maratho</em>n is a PvPvE game seemingly without anything in the way of a traditional story-based campaign. It’s already working from within the confines of a more niche genre. In a world where most other PvP games are free-to-play, charging anything might be one step too far when it comes to getting players on the sidelines to come in and check out the newest project from the studio responsible for their favorite college dorm <em>Halo 3</em> party back in the day. </p><p>Bungie and Sony are likely banking on that lingering brand power to get people to show up on day one. Whether it’s enough to also get them to pay is another thing entirely. </p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

It’s PvPvE, so players will have to fight one another as well as AI-controlled UESC security forces and “otherworldly threats” to loot facilities and complete their objectives. If they successfully extract, they grow in power and new gear gets added to a vault to be taken out and used on the next mission, but if they get wiped on the surface everything gets left behind. There’s also a tease for higher-stakes gameplay aboard the derelict Marathon ship orbiting the planet, potential endgame content <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/marathon-bungie-steam-release-free-1851470109&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/marathon-bungie-steam-release-free-1851470109">that calls back to Bungie’s original trilogy by the same name</a></span> that suggests linkages that long-time fans will have fun unraveling.</p><p> The overall structure of <em>Marathon</em> sounds like it will be familiar to <em>Escape from Tarkov</em> players and fans of other extraction shooters, with some unique wrinkles. By default players will be grouped into squads of three but can also play solo, with up to 18 total appearing on a given map at once. Every match has its own time limit forcing players into action, and dynamic weather and other random events will add extra chaos to the proceedings. Any loot you extract with gets added to a vault to be used in future runs, though if it’s ever lost in a team wipe, it’s lost for good. </p><p>What about the moment-to-moment gameplay? The core of <em>Marathon </em>will be Bungie’s snappy and crunchy gunplay, which if it’s anything like<em> Destiny 2</em>'s will be top-shelf when it comes to first-person shooters, but with a bunch of new tactical and strategic elements to take into consideration given the battle-royale nature of the showdowns. Players are downed instead of immediately killed, and a revive system means death isn’t the end of a run. Bungie also said that “sponsored packages” from various corporate factions will give players a baseline loadout needed to stay competitive. </p><p>And of course there will be custom builds and abilities. We saw four different runner characters—Locus, Blackbird, Glitch, and Void—each with unique looks, playstyles, and abilities that can offer an extra edge. There will be unique stats for different characters, as well as customization when it comes to implants, cores, weapons, weapon attachments. A toxin upgrade by poison opponents, or players could equip something to boost their resistance to it. And Marathon will have it’s own version of Destiny’s rarest Exotics loot that offers the “best” version of a particular archetype. </p><p> The gameplay footage shows one sniper character turning invisible, similar to Hunters from <em>Destiny 2</em>, while equipment like grenades, shields, and medkits offer other characters different support roles. “You’re always free to experiment with team compositions, and the only limit to how you want to play your runner is your loot and imagination,” Starr’s narrator voice promises. It sounds like a lot to balance, and the proof will be in whether player experimentation proves to be truly viable, or if <em>Marathon</em> quickly coalesces around a narrow range of try-hard build-crafting metas.</p><p>Player progression will be another interesting test. Most of it will be account-wide rather than class-dependent, with faction ranks unlocking access to different upgrades and black market merchandise (all purchased with in-game currency) and completed contracts expanding vault space. Beyond the matches themselves, there are endgame challenges, ranked play, community events, and seasonal storytelling. Perhaps the most dramatic thing about <em>Marathon</em> is that it will largely reset players’ vaults at the end of each season to provide a more level playing field going into the next. It’s the logical thing to do for fairer play but might also be exactly the type of thing to turn off more casual fans. </p><p><em>Marathon </em>will be Bungie’s first new project in over a decade and its first new game as part of PlayStation, where the reported underperformance of <em>Destiny 2</em> led to multiple rounds of deep cuts in the last two years. (The previous game director <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/bungie-ex-marathon-christopher-barrett-lawsuit-texts-1851765546&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/bungie-ex-marathon-christopher-barrett-lawsuit-texts-1851765546">was also fired in early 2024</a></span>). <em>Marathon</em> is facing an uphill climb for sure, especially a year after Sony’s other big live-service push, <em>Concord</em>, proved how brutal the multiplayer space is these days. But maybe Bungie’s extraction shooter will be more like <em>Helldivers 2</em>—infectious in its uncompromising focus on one hardcore gameplay loop. <em>Marathon</em> certainly <em>looks</em> like it has the juice. Hopefully, it ends up playing like it does too. A closed alpha test is set to begin on April 23.</p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
