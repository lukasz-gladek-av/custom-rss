Plus, the vocal clarity is crisp and clear.</p>



<p>Another feature of the Beats Studio Pro is the active noise cancellation that helps eliminate ambient noise so you can focus on your audio without distractions. No matter where you may be (on a crowded train, in a busy office, etc.) the ANC feature can make a serious difference. In addition to blocking out distractions, the Studio Pro headphones also have a feature called “Transparency Mode” that lets you allow outside noises in so you can hear what’s going on even when wearing the headphones.</p>
<p>In terms of battery life, the Beats Studio Pro can give you several hours of playback time on a single charge. In addition to the battery life, the carrying case of the headphones is capable of getting you back up to speed quickly so you are ready to go again.
