But this year, the team just put out another game, <em>Dragon Age: The Veilguard</em> and doesn’t want to steal the game’s thunder with a bunch of teases for a game that’s still a ways out. However, brand synergy is strong, and BioWare has put some <em>Mass Effect</em>-themed armor sets in <em>The Veilguard</em> for free.</p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="197298" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="Live Forever in the Universe of 'New World: Aeternum'" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="108" data-playlist="197298,197284,197260" data-current="197298"><div><p>Live Forever in the Universe of 'New World: Aeternum'</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197298/197298_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197298/197298_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197298/197298_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197298/197298_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"></video></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>The <em>Mass Effect </em>clothing can be found in the Lighthouse base. If you’ve finished Harding’s mission, “The Singing Blade,” you’ll find a chest next to the Workshop. Inside are two armor appearances called Specter of Battles Past and Paragon of Leadership as well as a helmet called Command Helmet. These aren’t armor sets with new stats, but instead are appearances you can set to wear in Rook’s room while maintaining the defense and effects of other armor sets. The Specter of Battles Past includes the recognizable red stripe down the sleeve that any <em>Mass Effect </em>fan would recognize as an homage to Commander Shepard’s armor in the original trilogy.

Now, on the verge of the next set Surging Sparks’ release, it’s a good moment to look at which Stellar Crown cards are getting the most love.</p><p>Things started going odd for the <em>Pokémon TCG</em> in January 2024, with Paldean Fates. This special set contained a ridiculous 88 baby shinies, and while <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/paldean-fates-pokemon-tcg-pull-rates-1851196505&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/paldean-fates-pokemon-tcg-pull-rates-1851196505">pull-rates felt amazing</a></span>, the sheer volume of cards made it utterly impossible to collect. This was followed by Temporal Forces and Twilight Masquerade, two sets with almost identical card numbers and pull rates, both with a galling one-in-five chance of receiving a secret rare or better. (Even bland ex cards were only appearing in one out of every six packs!) While this appears to be the new norm <em>Pokémon TCG</em> in the Scarlet &amp; Violet era (and looks set to continue with November’s Surging Sparks), it’s <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/pokemon-tcg-cards-value-crown-zenith-paldea-evolved-1850552711&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-tcg-cards-value-crown-zenith-paldea-evolved-1850552711">still hard not to hark back to the joy of sets like Crown Zenith</a></span>, and wish for better.</p><p>So it was even more galling when August’s “special” set, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/pokemon-tcg-shrouded-fable-pull-rate-1851611684&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-tcg-shrouded-fable-pull-rate-1851611684">Shrouded Fable, then bemused everyone</a></span> by featuring the lowest number of cards since the desultory <em>Pokémon Go </em>set in 2022, <em>and</em> making the good ones nightmarishly hard to find. Boy, did everyone get a lot of the same bulk.</p><p>So then came September’s Stellar Crown, and while the pull rates still sat at a sulk-inducing 20 percent, it sat at a sweet spot for size. A Goldilocks set, if you will. With a total of 175 cards, rather than the 220+ that had become the norm (and be warned, Surging Sparks has a deranged 252, with an eye-watering 191 of them before the secret rares start), it feels manageable, collectible, and most importantly, is packed with completely gorgeous cards.</p><p>Here are the cards fetching the highest prices, whether for the meta, or just because they’re so very pretty.

That was usually because the art was always so muted, compared to other versions in a set, and that the market was saturated. However, this year the three-star rarity seems to have gained a bit more traction again, and this card’s fetching almost <strong>$22</strong>, two months after release.</p><p>This is then boosted by Terapagos’s arrival in the TCG via Stellar Crown, and this card’s wild power when combined with that Area Zero Underdepths Stadium. 30 damage per card on your bench, with a possible eight cards total, means a whopping 240 attack just for two Energy. It’s a card so powerful it adds the caveat that you can’t use it on your turn in the first round.</p><p>But then it goes even further, offering a 180 attack with a follow-up that Basic Pokémon can’t damage it in the next turn, albeit for the tricky requirement of a Grass, Water <em>and</em> Lightning energy.</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="aae3c16cc5ada16aee4da81b018ec8c9" data-recommend-id="image://aae3c16cc5ada16aee4da81b018ec8c9" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Briar Special Illustration Rare." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Briar Special Illustration Rare." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->The Pokémon Company / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="aae3c16cc5ada16aee4da81b018ec8c9" data-recommend-id="image://aae3c16cc5ada16aee4da81b018ec8c9" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Briar Special Illustration Rare." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>I guess put this down to the ol’ <em>PTCG </em>tradition of any card with a full-art female character fetching bigger prices.</p><p>Sure, it’s an interesting Trainer, letting you take an extra Prize Card under extremely specific circumstances, but you know.

Then get another of those multi-Energy mixes and you can deliver 180 damage, although this time you lose all three Energy, but also stop your opponent using an Item card.</p><p>It’s so pretty, and I have to stop myself spending <strong>$26</strong> to get one.</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="8a37b6e5f0c710350e71759d788bee98" data-recommend-id="image://8a37b6e5f0c710350e71759d788bee98" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Dachsbun ex Special Illustration Rare." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Dachsbun ex Special Illustration Rare." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->The Pokémon Company / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="8a37b6e5f0c710350e71759d788bee98" data-recommend-id="image://8a37b6e5f0c710350e71759d788bee98" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Dachsbun ex Special Illustration Rare." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>I have very strong feelings about Pokémon made out of food.

But honestly, I don’t even much like the art on this one—it’s all a bit too glossy, the lighting makes no sense whatsoever. </p><p>However, as a healer, it’s crazy. If you’re playing a deck with a lot of evolving cards, this’ll heal all damage across all of them (at the cost of their Energy), simply by being put into play. It doesn’t even need to hit the Active Spot to achieve this. Then it’ll also deal out 130 damage, with added Confusion, for just two colorless Energy.</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="2fe189773ff9d58d3a2edeac1aa00295" data-recommend-id="image://2fe189773ff9d58d3a2edeac1aa00295" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Lacey Special Illustration Rare." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Lacey Special Illustration Rare." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->The Pokémon Company / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="2fe189773ff9d58d3a2edeac1aa00295" data-recommend-id="image://2fe189773ff9d58d3a2edeac1aa00295" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Lacey Special Illustration Rare." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>And here’s your waifu card, the SIR version of Lacey, with a wonderfully detailed piece of art, on a card that’s...fine in play?

It’s bloody marvellous!</p><p>It’s also a brilliant card to have in pretty much any deck, because if you can get that two-step evolution done on your bench, you can now attach an extra Energy every single turn, while also healing 30 damage each time, and it’s damned hard for your opponent to do anything about it.

By the TCG’s own ranking, this is only considered a single-star rarity, a card that should be showing up more frequently than the SIRs below it on the list. Yet here it is, in third place, with an asking price of <strong>$40</strong> for a small piece of cardboard.</p><p>It certainly helps that Orca’s art is utterly stunning, yet another example of how it’s inexplicable madness that The Pokémon Company doesn’t sell poster-sized versions of these art works in its stores. I’d put this on the wall in an instant.</p><p>As a card for your deck, it’s nothing special. It’s nice that it adds a 20HP heal to its 20 attack, but that comes at the cost of needing two Energy for a Basic card with such low damage. But honestly, play this and your opponent will be so distracted, craning their neck to get a better look at it, that you’ll put them right off their strategy.</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="6bfcefe83bd9791182851edfa88a72bc" data-recommend-id="image://6bfcefe83bd9791182851edfa88a72bc" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Squirtle Illustration Rare." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Squirtle Illustration Rare." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->The Pokémon Company / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="6bfcefe83bd9791182851edfa88a72bc" data-recommend-id="image://6bfcefe83bd9791182851edfa88a72bc" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Squirtle Illustration Rare." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>Poor Bulbasaur, always in third place, behind Squirtle and the all-conquering Charmander. There’s no special Charmander in this set, however, nor even a Charizard, meaning Squirtle gets second place, and first place is a mystery for once!</p><p>It’s a lovely card, and it’s great how both this and Bulbasaur feature Pidgey, but come on people, the Bulbasaur art is objectively, scientifically better. That’s taking nothing away from artist Saborteri, because this too is gorgeous.</p><p>It’s not often you see two different attacks on a Basic card like Squirtle, so that one-Energy 50:50 chance of preventing damage is a useful device if you’re forced to start this in your Active Spot, before being able to evolve. Or for a silly two Energy, you can do a measly 20 damage.</p><p>It’s ahead of Bulbasaur by four bucks, currently going for <strong>$44</strong>.</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="f146493c6f0b8e3f9f41213068004414" data-recommend-id="image://f146493c6f0b8e3f9f41213068004414" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Terapagos ex Special Illustration Rare." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Terapagos ex Special Illustration Rare." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->The Pokémon Company / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="f146493c6f0b8e3f9f41213068004414" data-recommend-id="image://f146493c6f0b8e3f9f41213068004414" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Terapagos ex Special Illustration Rare." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>Woah.</p><p>This is a card of such exceptional detail that it comes close to rivaling <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Giratina_V_(Lost_Origin_130)#/media/File:GiratinaVLostOrigin186.jpg&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Giratina_V_(Lost_Origin_130)#/media/File:GiratinaVLostOrigin186.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Lost Origin’s Giratina V SR</a></span>! (Which, by the way, has seen a recent revival, currently going for $400 or more.) This is a more subtle affair, though, and I think tempered by its rather twee pastel vibes, but that’s not holding it back much. This card is still, two months on, fetching over <strong>$94</strong>.</p><p>Make sure to enlarge that image above to appreciate the incredible effort from artist Saboteri (yup, the same person responsible for the Squirtle!).</p><p>That price is a fair chunk down from its initial high of $150, and part of a more gradual decline following its initial plunge to $115. Will it level out, or continue dropping? I sort of suspect the latter, and imagine this’ll find its base at around $60. Cards of this much artistic complexity tend to keep more value, but it’s hard to argue that Terapagos has gained some sort of mass fan adoration in the way Giratina can claim. It is, after all, a hairy turtle.</p><p>In play, this card is exactly the same as the gold version at the start of this list, as indeed is the $8 Double Rare version. Although, given its popularity in the meta, you won’t find it cheaper than that for the moment.</p><p>Still, at more than double anything else in the set, this is clearly the card to pull from Stellar Crown. Get it graded at a PSA 10 and that price goes up to $334.</p><p>.</p></div></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
