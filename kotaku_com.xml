There are lots of typical bug fixes and gameplay adjustments, but also something completely new for an EA sports game: Adobe Express. The program will let players design custom logos for stadiums and jerseys in <em>College Football 25</em>'s Team Builder mode, either from scratch or using generative AI. </p><p>“Team Builder is getting an upgrade!” reads the developer commentary part of the patch notes. “We’re excited to announce a new partnership with our friends from Adobe. Adobe Express, a content and design generation tool, is now integrated as an optional feature into Team Builder, allowing you to express your creativity and customize your experience in more ways than ever.”</p><p>Players need to have an existing Adobe account and pay out of pocket for the generative tool, but they’ll get 25 credits to start with. Some players already use Adobe to make their designs and import them separately, while others prefer to use the in-game tools. “God, I hope they keep the Adobe thing as optional because I have a fear it will become Adobe everything by the next game so they can have that partnership and reap more money off this game,” wrote one fan on the subreddit. “As well Adobe at least for me is a slow-ass tool.”</p><p>Earlier this year, EA CEO Andrew Wilson <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/ea-college-football-25-generative-ai-fifa-1851609733&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/ea-college-football-25-generative-ai-fifa-1851609733">said that AI tools</a></span>, including machine learning, were the only way that <em>College Football 25</em>, with thousands upon thousands of unique players hailing from all different schools, was able to be made. It’s the franchise’s first new sequel since 2013 back when it was called <em>NCAA Football 14</em>.

Last year, around this same time, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/half-life-new-update-fixed-old-bug-animation-blast-pit-1851043667&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/half-life-new-update-fixed-old-bug-animation-blast-pit-1851043667">Valve fixed a very old bug in <em>Half-Life</em></a></span> involving a monster’s animation. I think as the year wraps up, Valve might let devs tinker as the holidays approach, and perhaps that’s why this patch has suddenly appeared. Maybe someone got a bit of free time and used it to hop into <em>TF2 </em>and correct this mistake? </p><p>Or perhaps Valve just likes trolling fans? Maybe both! Anyway, Scout’s pants are finally the correct color and we can all sleep easy knowing that the world is a better place. </p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Lara’s thrilling new adventure takes her around the globe as she delves deeper into the hidden secrets of Orisha history, dodges the machinations of a dangerous and enigmatic billionaire who wants the masks for herself, while discovering these relics contain dark secrets and a power that defies logic. Power that may, in fact, be divine.</p></blockquote><p>It at least sounds a bit more exciting that the first season, and confirms the main voice actors are returning to the project.</p><p>Of course, the animation also drew the Eye of Mauron, because—I dunno—Lara’s breasts weren’t scraping on her toes, or that one character who was also in that one game in 2006 wasn’t a carbon copy? You know how they are, confusing the entire world and all that exists within it with their personal masturbatory material. User scores are extremely low, as a result of sad little boys who are too scared to go to Porn Hub. So on this level alone, it’s a pleasure to see the show renewed, just to watch them have to put their “GO WOKE GO BROKE” jpegs back in their soggy pockets.</p><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://deadline.com/2024/10/spike-jonze-series-netflix-dead-1236157805/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://deadline.com/2024/10/spike-jonze-series-netflix-dead-1236157805/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">We also learned</a></span> today that Spike Jonze’s exciting-sounding sci-fi project is no more, before filming even began. It’s unknown if that was Netflix’s decision, or Jonze’s. Now please sign my petition to renew <em>Kaos</em>. I need more Jeff!</p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Well, for starters, it’s because the game’s made entirely of pixel art, which doesn’t allow for much experimentation or sexualization…Or does it? Of <em>course</em> it does.<br></p><p>As it turns out, the modding community caters to everyone, including those who want a little more on-screen nudity or depravity in their indie farming sims. It wasn’t difficult to find the six thirstiest mods for <em>Stardew Valley</em>. It was more challenging to narrow the list down to just those we could show you.</p><p><strong>Be warned: This article contains sexually explicit and suggestive content.</strong></p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="0c9635d36ab50701001f81a762f431eb" data-recommend-id="image://0c9635d36ab50701001f81a762f431eb" data-format="webp" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt=" A scene from Xtardew Valley in Stardew Valley" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt=" A scene from Xtardew Valley in Stardew Valley" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Pseudodiego / ConcernedApe</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="0c9635d36ab50701001f81a762f431eb" data-recommend-id="image://0c9635d36ab50701001f81a762f431eb" data-format="webp" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt=" A scene from Xtardew Valley in Stardew Valley" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>There’s lewd, and then there’s downright nude. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.nexusmods.com/stardewvalley/mods/4399&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.nexusmods.com/stardewvalley/mods/4399" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Xtardew Valley</a></span> opts for the latter by introducing adult-themed content into the pixel art farming sim. It includes additional relationship content for all bachelors and bachelorettes, along with a few of the townsfolk, and a big part of that is sex.<br></p><p>You can now have sex with nearly every romanceable female in the game, along with a few of the married women who were previously off limits, in a variety of strange locales, and positions. Occasionally, you’ll stumble on one of the iconic characters neck-deep in erotic situations, and we mean that literally and figuratively.</p><p>We recommend starting a new game with this one, as you may miss out on many of the unique scenes and heart events added to the game with Xtardew Valley. It somewhat broke my old save.</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="193c92258751d17fc21e466578463702" data-recommend-id="image://193c92258751d17fc21e466578463702" data-format="webp" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="A title card from the mod Yandere Haley Dialogue Expansion in Stardew Valley." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A title card from the mod Yandere Haley Dialogue Expansion in Stardew Valley." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Kxgarashii / ConcernedApe</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="193c92258751d17fc21e466578463702" data-recommend-id="image://193c92258751d17fc21e466578463702" data-format="webp" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="A title card from the mod Yandere Haley Dialogue Expansion in Stardew Valley." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>Thanks to anime’s influence, there are so many Dere types in the world, and <em>Stardew Valley</em>’s modding community is working overtime to implement them all. This one is the <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.nexusmods.com/stardewvalley/mods/7921&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.nexusmods.com/stardewvalley/mods/7921" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Yandere Haley Dialogue Expansion</a></span>, and it turns everyone’s favorite giggly photographer into something a bit more extreme.<br></p><p>A yandere is a character that appears overly affectionate at first but winds up outright psychopathic due to their overwhelming admiration and love. They are jealous and possessive, and now you can enjoy that level of crazy in the game, with more than 170 new lines of dialogue, including pre-marriage, post-marriage, and festival scenes for Haley!</p><p>At one point, you’ll discover piles of photographs taken from outside the window of your farmhouse. It appears Haley likes to sneak around in the twilight hours, snapping photos of you at your most intimate moments. Oh, and don’t let her catch you with someone else. She has a few choice words should you start to get close to other characters, warning you of the consequences. All that said, it’s purely flavor dialogue for those who enjoy this personality type.</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="8a49234629295a4219668fbbe8b31a62" data-recommend-id="image://8a49234629295a4219668fbbe8b31a62" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Devious Valley." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Devious Valley." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->undare / ConcernedApe</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="8a49234629295a4219668fbbe8b31a62" data-recommend-id="image://8a49234629295a4219668fbbe8b31a62" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Devious Valley." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>It’s time for the gentlemen to get a touch-up in Devious Valley, which implements male-led romance and sexual encounters by introducing new characters, a frat house, a pool filled with urine, and plenty of welcoming bears.<br></p><p>Furthermore, as a male character, you’ll encounter additional dialogue and cutscenes with the townsfolk. If you raise your relationship high enough with, say, Alex, he might fiend for you with a certain hunger that his pants betray.</p><p>If that’s not enough and you want to implement a little kink into the mix, there are milking machines for each bachelor in the game, so that’s something to consider…I guess.</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="ae19e1fe89deb82533b13922cf1328c5" data-recommend-id="image://ae19e1fe89deb82533b13922cf1328c5" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Valley Girls." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Valley Girls." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->TrashRacc1124 / ConcernedApe</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="ae19e1fe89deb82533b13922cf1328c5" data-recommend-id="image://ae19e1fe89deb82533b13922cf1328c5" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Valley Girls." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>As most characters in <em>Stardew Valley</em> are grown ups, considering you can marry most of them, it only makes sense that they occasionally enjoy a horizontal refreshment as consenting adults.<br></p><p>With Valley Girls, every female now features a schedule in which they will wander off, find somewhere relatively secluded, and pleasure themselves—sometimes alone and sometimes with a partner. You can meet up for a thrilling romp in the backroom of Gus’ pub, for example, or in the locker room at the spa.</p><p>Be wary, however. In addition to pixel sprites getting it on, the mod features fully realized portraits of the game’s characters in all their morning glory. It’s downright not safe for work! But if that’s your cup of tea, I recommend visiting the beach occasionally. You’ll find Haley and Alex midway into a trip through the backdoor behind Elliot’s shack in the sand.</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="8cb07b40f8cbc1d84a809e53b3f7edcc" data-recommend-id="image://8cb07b40f8cbc1d84a809e53b3f7edcc" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Nude Girls." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Nude Girls." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->TrashRacc1124 / Concerned Ape</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="8cb07b40f8cbc1d84a809e53b3f7edcc" data-recommend-id="image://8cb07b40f8cbc1d84a809e53b3f7edcc" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Nude Girls." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>Some people swap out the character portraits in <em>Stardew Valley</em> with anime or period attire to fit a role-play they’re working through. Some, however, prefer lewd portraits, and that’s where Nude Girls enters the scene. It replaces the current sprites, portraits, and outfits for many of the game’s female characters. Once installed, they swap to nude versions, bearing everything in dialogue and out in the world.<br></p><p>It’s important to note this is purely a flavor mod. There are no significant additions or alterations to the gameplay; it simply swaps the women around with scantily-clad, often wholly naked sprites and portraits. Trying to read about a character’s hardships while she’s flashing you is a little distracting, but some players enjoy that!</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="da1e8dd1908a0c2639b6475440dc7e08" data-recommend-id="image://da1e8dd1908a0c2639b6475440dc7e08" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Lustdew Valley" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Lustdew Valley" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->TrashRacc1124 / Concerned Ape</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="da1e8dd1908a0c2639b6475440dc7e08" data-recommend-id="image://da1e8dd1908a0c2639b6475440dc7e08" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Lustdew Valley" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>Thanks to mod author TrashRacc1124, Lustdew Valley works as an extension of Valley Girl by increasing the sexual occurrences across the Valley with new locations, objects, furniture, clothing, and cutscenes in due time. It’s essentially an overhaul that expands the game’s adult flavor significantly.<br></p><p>Lustdew Valley features a secretive bathroom entrance in the Valley Girls Bathroom, leading to new locations, interactive sex booths, gloryholes, and a completely new shop vendor with unique items, hats, and clothing. Of course, if you fancy yourself a connoisseur of a particular Czech-produced adult series, you’ll find the patrons of the new area to your liking.</p><p>By the way, there’s a new bundle to unlock, but it requires a handful of worn sex toys found throughout the bachelorettes’ rooms. I only saw the one for Haley and Emily since I tend to romance the former in my playthroughs.</p><p>Who knew the world of <em>Stardew Valley </em>modding could take such a turn? Anyone who’s been on the internet—that’s who. If you want a total overhaul that’s a little more wholesome, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/stardew-valley-expanded-mod-concernedape-1851668970&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/stardew-valley-expanded-mod-concernedape-1851668970">we recommend checking out <em>Stardew Valley Expanded</em></a></span>!</p></div></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
