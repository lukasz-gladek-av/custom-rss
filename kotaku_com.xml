              <p>I consume a firehose of online content every day as part of my job. At some point in the last week, through a post, comment, or video I can no longer remember, I became aware of a shortcut for tinkering with the brightness on my Switch 2. Turns out this existed on the original Switch as well. All you have to do his hold down the home button to instantly bring up the slider. Eureka!</p>

 <p>I’ve had the old Switch since it launched back in March 2017. I still remember passing through the food court at the mall to pick it up from GameStop. Thousands of hours later, it feels slightly embarrassing to report that I never knew about this settings menu shortcut.</p>

 <p>I change my brightness settings a lot depending on where I’m sitting, the time of day, how bright it is outside, and who’s around me. To cut down on the glare in my porch room, I boost it to the max. To save battery on long car rides with the kids, I toggle it way down. In bed with my partner and two-year-old while grinding runs of <em>Hades 2</em>, I also keep the screen dim to not wake them up.</p>

 <p>And every damn time I did it, I was going back to the home screen, clicking on the settings, and going to the screen brightness bar. Was this the biggest hassle in the world? Obviously not! But I love games and I love gaming hardware and one of the cornerstones of that hobby is min-maxing and I felt a little pang of humiliation when I realized I’d been using my Switch sub-optimally all these years.</p> <p>No longer! Don’t be like me! Take the knowledge of this home button shortcut and go control your screen brightness the way Nintendo intended.</p>

              <p><span>Ever since </span><i><span>Pokémon </span></i><span>stopped including every monster in every game with </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-fans-i-need-yall-to-shut-up-about-dexit-1839949110"><i><span>Sword </span></i><span>and </span><i><span>Shield</span></i></a><span>, someone’s favorite probably gets left behind in each new release. Sure, they might show up in the next game or two, but there are over 1000 of these guys now, and everyone’s bound to get benched now and then. Up until last week, </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/only-three-pokemon-are-catchable-in-every-game-but-not-1850461272"><span>only three Pokémon could claim to be catchable in every single RPG</span></a><span>. Now that </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-legends-za-review-switch-2-bugs-performance-2000637719"><i><span>Pokémon Legends: Z-A</span></i></a> <span>is out, two of those are off the list, leaving only one left in every game. And no, it’s not Pikachu, the electric mouse and mascot of the whole franchise.</span></p> <p><span>Magikarp is, as of this writing, the only Pokémon you can obtain normally in every </span><i><span>Pokémon </span></i><span>RPG. This means without trades, hacks, or anything outside the scope of the game. The floundering fish that evolves into one of the most fearsome monsters in the franchise has kept this streak for almost 30 years, thanks to a salesman in </span><i><span>Pokémon Black </span></i><span>and </span><i><span>White</span></i><span> who would give you the water Pokémon. </span><i><span>Black </span></i><span>and </span><i><span>White </span></i><span>was the combo breaker for almost every other Pokémon because its dex was made up almost entirely of brand new Pokémon from the Unova region, meaning Pikachu, Charizard, and many other mainstays were only available in the post-game. Psyduck and Magnemite were also catchable in </span><i><span>Black </span></i><span>and </span><i><span>White </span></i><span>through some extremely roundabout means, but they were there, too.</span></p> <figure id="attachment_2000638880" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000638880"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000638880">© The Pokémon Company / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p><span>Now, however, Psyduck and Magnemite are nowhere to be found in </span><i><span>Z-A</span></i><span>. This might change with the </span><i><span>Mega Dimension </span></i><span>DLC, as they were both reinstated to the ranks of Magikarp through </span><i><span>Sword </span></i><span>and </span><i><span>Shield</span></i><span>’s DLC, but for now, there’s no sign of the headache-ridden duck or the sentient magnets, making Magikarp the reigning champ. For now, at least. Things might change in the </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-leak-generation-10-wind-wave-galar-legends-mmo-2000635337"><span>Gen X games that are reportedly coming next year</span></a><span>.</span></p>
