And now, this trend will continue on November 20 with the addition of <em>The Storybook Vale</em>, bringing a whole lot of cool stuff to the game we’ve never seen before.</p><p>Here’s what you need to know about what’s coming in <em>Disney Dreamlight Valley</em>’s all-new <em>The Storybook Vale</em> expansion.</p><h2 id="h145022"><a id=""></a>It has a new story and new villains!</h2><figure id="" data-id="e6a5a938f802e195eef58b8589311dcb" data-recommend-id="image://e6a5a938f802e195eef58b8589311dcb" data-format="jpg" data-width="2560" data-height="1440" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Characters from Hercules are portrayed in a painting." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Characters from Hercules are portrayed in a painting." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="false" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Disney</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="e6a5a938f802e195eef58b8589311dcb" data-recommend-id="image://e6a5a938f802e195eef58b8589311dcb" data-format="jpg" data-width="2560" data-height="1440" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Characters from Hercules are portrayed in a painting." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>A new story will take place within the DLC, promising exciting twists and turns as you work to fend off the influence of two new villains who have taken over the Vale.

All of these locations will have their own new plants, fish, and critters.</p><p>Yes, we said new critters! You’ll also find that each of these biomes in the Vale is home to new critters.

How these little fellows play into the overarching story is yet to be seen, but they appear to be pet-like in nature, so perhaps they’ll ultimately end up as our companions! </p><p>Either way, this popular cozy game feature is almost certain to appeal to fans who remember similar mechanics in games like <em>Animal Crossing</em> or <em>Cozy Grove</em>.</p><h2 id="h145026"><a id="editions"></a>There are three ways to access it!</h2><figure id="" data-id="2d4436a3b0d4caefe1f6efdfd7ccac9e" data-recommend-id="image://2d4436a3b0d4caefe1f6efdfd7ccac9e" data-format="png" data-width="3840" data-height="2160" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A spreadsheet shows the differences between different Storybook Vale editions." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A spreadsheet shows the differences between different Storybook Vale editions." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="false" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Disney</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="2d4436a3b0d4caefe1f6efdfd7ccac9e" data-recommend-id="image://2d4436a3b0d4caefe1f6efdfd7ccac9e" data-format="png" data-width="3840" data-height="2160" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A spreadsheet shows the differences between different Storybook Vale editions." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>While you can buy the expansion pass separately, <em>Disney Dreamlight Valley</em> offers multiple editions of <em>The Storybook Vale</em>.

Then, it flips a coin to see who goes first. Players place their Pokémon on the board and whoever won the coin toss gets to pick a card and then...nothing. <em>Pokémon</em> card battles revolve around energy, and you get one energy at the start of each turn, unless you’re going first when you skip it entirely. And without it, the the adorable little creatures are useless unless they happen to have a special ability attached to them. Most do not, however, leaving whoever goes first immediately hamstrung. </p><p>Instead, it’s the person who goes second who gets draw their first energy and get the attack rolling. A Farfetch’d with one energy can immediately start hitting for 40 damage.

From that point on, whoever went first is just playing catch-up.</p><p>It’s already become an <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/PTCGP/comments/1glo6d2/just_why/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/PTCGP/comments/1glo6d2/just_why/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">established meme</a></span> within the <em>TCG Pocket</em> community that this sucks. It’s not just that going first in the game doesn’t convey the usual card game advantages; it’s that going first is basically a fake turn that doesn’t actually let the player engage with the most important mechanic in the game. <em>TCG Pocket</em>’s first PvP event going live earlier this week made made the pain point even more pronounced as top-tier decks steamrolled everyone. </p><p> “If this event has shown me anything,” <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/PTCGP/comments/1glygha/one_advantage_however_is_that_you_can_concede/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/PTCGP/comments/1glygha/one_advantage_however_is_that_you_can_concede/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">one player writes on Reddit</a></span>, “if you go first against any of the top 3 decks right now you will more then likely loose unless they draw like shit.”</p><p>“While it’s hard to achieve a true 50/50 between going first and going second, if not impossible,” argued another, “this game’s balance between the two is atrocious, surely you could get closer than this, it feels like a good 70-30 split, if not worse.”</p><p>Card games have tried to balance the first-mover advantage in different ways. <em>Magic: The Gathering</em> doesn’t let whoever goes first draw a card in the first round, a consequential move given the big deck sizes and the importance keeping up momentum with new resources to deploy. <em>Hearthstone</em> deals with the issue by letting the second player mulligan an extra card and get a one-time extra mana boost. <em>Marvel Snap</em> side-steps the issue entirely by having both players play their turns simultaneously. And while the table-top version of <em>Pokémon TCG</em> still stops the first turn from attacking, it at least lets you attach an energy and get your hand rolling.</p><p>Someone will always have a slight advantage in <em>TCG Pocket</em> depending on the turn order. That’s why there’s a coin flip to help make that as random as possible. But it would still feel way better if the player who goes second got to do something extra, rather than just penalizing whoever goes first.

But what it didn’t have was Macaulay Culkin.</p><p>If <em>Deadline</em>’s claims are true, that’s being put right, as the former child star joins Ella Purnell, Aaron Moten and Walton Goggins for the new run—one that is said to already be filming, as leaked by another star of the show, Leslie Uggams, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://screenrant.com/fallout-season-2-filming-start-month-revealed-leslie-uggams/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://screenrant.com/fallout-season-2-filming-start-month-revealed-leslie-uggams/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">to <em>Screen Rant</em></a></span>.</p><p>Culkin has had a bit of a renaissance of late, beginning with a run on 2021's season of <em>American Horror Story</em>, an arc in <em>The Righteous Gemstones</em>, and providing voices for Kid Cudi’s <em>Entergalactic </em>and Amazon’s <em>The Second Best Hospital in the Galaxy</em>. It’s fair to say that in recent years, he’s also been rather overshadowed by his kid brother, following Kieran Culkin’s breakout success in <em>Succession</em>. But this is the moment to reclaim that limelight and let the sibling rivalry live on.</p><p>There’s no release date announced for the new season of <em>Fallout</em>, but in the streaming era, it’s surprising that it’s filming already—there’s usually at least an eight-month writers’ room before cameras are switched back on. However, given the likely lengthy post-production a show like this will require, it could still easily be late 2025 before anything appears.</p><p>.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
