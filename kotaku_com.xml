The SD cards the games were installed on were tiny while the plastic surrounding them was exponentially bigger. Most cases didn’t even come with anything else inside. I’ve enjoyed collecting them but they were a huge waste. According to a new leak, the Switch 2 cases might be even worse.</p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="195670" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="This Stylish Noir-Punk Side-Scroller Is Like Celeste With Guns" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="184" data-playlist="195670,196181,196230" data-current="195670"><div><p>This Stylish Noir-Punk Side-Scroller Is Like Celeste With Guns</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195670/195670_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195670/195670_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195670/195670_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195670/195670_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/21167.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>The biggest takeaway <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/switch-2-reveal-trailer-date-nintendo-mario-kart-9-1851739487&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/switch-2-reveal-trailer-date-nintendo-mario-kart-9-1851739487">from the Switch 2 reveal last month</a></span> was that everything about the new console is bigger. Bigger Joy-Con controllers, bigger screen, bigger <em>Mario Kart</em> races. And it sounds like the game cases might be bigger too. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://t.co/9p2UZtCGQI&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://t.co/9p2UZtCGQI" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>Universo Nintendo</em></a></span> editor Felipe Lima <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://x.com/necrolipe/status/1877464328762269832&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://x.com/necrolipe/status/1877464328762269832" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">reported in January</a></span> that French retailer FNAC had accidentally leaked the dimensions for a Take-Two Switch 2 game at 5.12 inches wide and 7.7 inches tall. </p><p>Then last week, Switch 2 subreddit user HertzBurst <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/NintendoSwitch2/comments/1icr469/switch_2_boxart_size_comparison_via_leaked/?utm_source=embedv2&amp;utm_medium=post_embed&amp;utm_content=post_title&amp;embed_host_url=https://kinja.com/embed/inset/iframe&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/NintendoSwitch2/comments/1icr469/switch_2_boxart_size_comparison_via_leaked/?utm_source=embedv2&amp;utm_medium=post_embed&amp;utm_content=post_title&amp;embed_host_url=https://kinja.com/embed/inset/iframe" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">made an artistic rendering</a></span> to show just how much bigger this roughly 43-percent increase in case size would look. If these new dimensions are accurate, and not just an error or placeholder, they would make Switch 2 game cases even taller than PS5 cases, which are only 6.7 inches tall. Those cases hold Blu-ray discs, though. While they’re often similarly devoid of game manuals and other inserts, at least in that case the box is barely much bigger than the thing it’s holding.</p><p>The Switch 2, on the other hand, will presumably feature SD cartridges similar in size, if not identical to, the existing ones. What could Nintendo possibly need all of this extra space for? Is it really that afraid of people walking into GameStop or Walmart and accidentally buying a Switch 2 game for a Switch 1 or vice-versa? Or will the new console usher in a new golden age of game cases bursting with maps, posters, and other cool stuff?</p><p>I still remember buying games for <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/the-binding-of-isaac-on-nintendo-switch-has-a-gorgeous-1793423566&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/the-binding-of-isaac-on-nintendo-switch-has-a-gorgeous-1793423566">my original Switch on launch day</a></span>. I opened up <em>The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild</em> and it was empty except for a small rectangular nugget of plastic. <em>The Binding of Isaac: Afterbirth+</em>, on the other hand, came with stickers and a beautiful little gold booklet directly inspired by the manual for the original <em>Legend of Zelda</em> on NES. It felt complete. My obsession with buying games physically was rewarded. </p><p>Somehow I don’t think the Switch 2 games will, on average at least, do the same. But if these really are the specs, then surely Nintendo has to shove something else in there, doesn’t it? The company wouldn’t just ship millions of bigger plastic shells all over the world with nothing but tiny cartridges inside? Right? Right??</p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Fighting huge mobs of enemies and grinding out rare loot is perfect for pick-up-and-play gaming, especially while you lay in bed listening to all those podcasts your friends keep bugging you to check out. Granted, this is only a great experience if the game you’re playing runs well on Valve’s flagship portable device, so how does <em>Path of Exile 2</em> hold up?</p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="196358" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="The Top 10 Most-Played Games On Steam Deck: December 2023 Edition" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="359" data-playlist="196358,195624,196131" data-current="196358"><div><p>The Top 10 Most-Played Games On Steam Deck: December 2023 Edition</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196358/196358_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196358/196358_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196358/196358_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196358/196358_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/21905.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>To cut to the chase, <em>Path of Exile 2</em> is…adequate at best on Steam Deck. The good news is that it’s playable without any extra setup (assuming you own it on Steam, other clients may require some Desktop-mode finagling). In fact, <em>Path of Exile 2</em> directly supports the device and displays the Steam Deck’s buttons on your hotbar. The bad news is that, even after fiddling with the settings, <em>Path of Exile 2</em>’s performance wildly varies. Sure, when only a few monsters are on screen, you <em>can </em>achieve up to 60 FPS. However, when fighting swarms of enemies,<strong> the frame rate can dip as low as 20 FPS</strong>. All told, <strong>expect an average of around 40 FPS on the Steam Deck, with social hubs like towns typically running at around 25 FPS</strong>.</p><p>To be fair, <em>Path of Exile 2</em> is an early access game. The fact that it’s already playable <em>at all </em>on the Steam Deck is kind of a treat, and it has plenty of room for optimization before <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.pathofexile.com/forum/view-thread/3587981&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.pathofexile.com/forum/view-thread/3587981" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">its anticipated full release in 2025</a></span>. For reference, <em>Diablo IV</em> was finicky on the Steam Deck during its pre-release betas too, but is now really smooth on the device. This isn’t to say <em>Path of Exile 2</em> will definitely run better in the future, but its shortcomings here should be put in context.</p><h2 id="h109785"><a id=""></a>The best settings for Path of Exile 2 on Steam Deck</h2><figure id="" data-id="222c1b7a90b9040dbbd687bf59ae8c53" data-recommend-id="image://222c1b7a90b9040dbbd687bf59ae8c53" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="800" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A screenshot of Path of Exile 2 running on the Steam Deck.

Because the frame rate can dip harshly when the screen gets chaotic. You’ll want to pick up frames almost anywhere you can to compensate. <strong>Here are all the settings I changed to get the game to run smoother on my device</strong>:</p><ul data-type="List" data-style="Bullet"><li>Mode: Fullscreen</li><li>Upscale Mode: FSR</li><li>Max Image Quality: Ultra Performance</li><li>Lighting: Shadows</li><li>Sun Shadow Quality: Low</li><li>Number of Lights: Low</li><li>Water Detail Level: Low</li><li>Dynamic Culling: On</li><li>Target Framerate: 38</li></ul><p>Because of the Steam Deck’s screen resolution of 1280 X 800, these low settings don’t actually impact the visuals <em>that </em>much. FSR upscaling will make everything look a bit blurry, but it’s still an upgrade from how the game looks without it. I’ve seen some recommendations that changing the Renderer from Vulkan to DirectX12 can improve performance, but I didn’t experience any noticeable change for the better during my testing.</p><figure id="" data-id="e2688f75433781e842ac900977144daf" data-recommend-id="image://e2688f75433781e842ac900977144daf" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="800" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A screenshot of Path of Exile 2 running on the Steam Deck.

However, since this squishes text size down a lot, I’d only recommend this in emergencies. As it is, map text is practically unreadable at the Steam Deck’s resolution, and several windows in the menu already get cut off (such as the menu that pops up when using Skill Gems).</p><p>Also, since <em>Path of Exile 2</em> is an always online game, <strong>make sure your Steam Deck isn’t downloading anything in the background</strong>. You can toggle whether or not your Deck downloads games in the background by going to Settings &gt; Downloads and ticking the appropriate setting. An unstable connection will cause your game to lag, which is especially untenable in moments when the frame rate drops. You don’t need a wired connection for smooth performance, but you also can’t download every episode of <em>The Simpsons </em>or some massive RPG while you play, either.</p><figure id="" data-id="d9302c940fea186d457af546780403f4" data-recommend-id="image://d9302c940fea186d457af546780403f4" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="800" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A screenshot of Path of Exile 2 running on the Steam Deck.

Would I recommend endgame grinding on the Steam Deck? <strong>Hell no</strong>. But does it work well enough to casually progress the campaign? Sure, especially since throwing your character headfirst into packed crowds of enemies isn’t a good idea when you <em>aren’t</em> worried about performance issues. However, <strong>if the Steam Deck is your primary platform for PC gaming, I’d sooner recommend </strong><em><strong>Diablo IV</strong></em><strong> if you want a modern ARPG on the go</strong>. Blizzard’s game just runs a lot better on the Steam Deck as of writing, whether you own it via Steam or Battlenet. Even if you prefer the gameplay of <em>Path of Exile 2</em>, it just doesn’t hold a candle to <em>Diablo</em>’s performance right now.</p><p>Still, you’ll want to keep an eye on <em>Path of Exile 2</em> in the future. When asked about the game’s Steam Deck performance <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.theouterhaven.net/2024/11/interview-path-of-exile-2-director-talks-development-gameplay-and-steam-deck/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.theouterhaven.net/2024/11/interview-path-of-exile-2-director-talks-development-gameplay-and-steam-deck/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">In an interview with The Outerhaven</a></span>, Grinding Gear Games’ Johnathan Rogers noted the team is “focused on ensuring that fans across all platforms get a great experience.” Additionally, the PC Handheld market is really taking off, with devices like <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://news.lenovo.com/pressroom/press-releases/lenovo-legion-unleashes-next-gen-gaming-power-at-ces-2025/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://news.lenovo.com/pressroom/press-releases/lenovo-legion-unleashes-next-gen-gaming-power-at-ces-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">the upcoming Lenovo Legion Go S</a></span> officially using SteamOS right out of the box. So whether the game gets optimized down the line or you wind up with better hardware in your hands, <em>Path of Exile 2</em> could become the premium portable experience it deserves to be. Just don’t buy into it on the promise that it’ll maybe run better for you in the future.</p><p>.<br></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
