              <p>Mastercard has broken its silence <a href="https://kotaku.com/steam-itch-io-sex-game-nsfw-censor-visa-mastercard-1851787281">after being thrust into the middle of a gaming culture war</a> between anti-porn advocates and anti-censorship activists. While Valve previously laid blame for a recent purge of adult sex games from Steam at the feet of “payment processors and their related card networks and banks,” Mastercard released a statement on Friday denying any responsibility for a new wave of censorship that’s recently led some gamers to flood payment company call centers with complaints.</p> <p>“Mastercard has not evaluated any game or required restrictions of any activity on game creator sites and platforms, contrary to media reports and allegations,” the company wrote in a statement published on its website on August 1. “Our payment network follows standards based on the rule of law. Put simply, we allow all lawful purchases on our network. At the same time, we require merchants to have appropriate controls to ensure Mastercard cards cannot be used for unlawful purchases, including illegal adult content.”</p> <p>Mastercard and Visa have been on the receiving end of an anti-game censorship backlash after anti-porn group Collective Shout <a href="https://kotaku.com/steam-sex-censorship-hentai-gta-5-collective-shout-1851786636">claimed victory</a> in a write-in campaign targeting payment company CEOs for allegedly profiting off of what the group called “violent pornography.” Critics of the move recently told&nbsp;<em>Kotaku</em> they’ve been calling the companies multiple times over the last week to complain about Valve and indie game shop itch.io purging seemingly legal NSFW content from their platforms over fears of reportedly being dropped by Mastercard and others.</p> <p>To be clear, Mastercard doesn’t say it hasn’t been involved at all, just that it’s gone no further than enforcing its existing guidelines against “unlawful purchases, including illegal adult content.” But a renewed crackdown on those requirements, which can be vague in practice, has resulted in Valve and itch.io delisting anywhere from hundreds to thousands of games they worry could get it in trouble with Mastercard and others.</p> <p>Earlier today, itch.io founder Leaf Corcoran <a href="https://kotaku.com/itch-nsfw-adult-games-visa-mastercard-collective-shout-2000614199">announced the indie storefront</a> is bringing back delisted NSFW games that were free, but is “still in ongoing discussions with payment processors” over paid content which will be reintroduced “slowly.” It could suggest the recent call-in campaigns castigating the credit card companies have changed the calculus for the companies involved. It certainly sounds like Mastercard regrets ever being dragged into this fight, even though it’s the one in the driver’s seat.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              
              <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/marvel-tokon-fighting-souls-vs-capcom-state-of-play-ps5-1851783734"><i><span>Marvel Tōkon: Fighting Souls</span></i></a><span>, the Arc System Works fighting game starring all your favorite Marvel heroes, isn’t coming out until next year. You might be wondering, then, why the studio put out a lengthy beginner’s guide for the game when no one’s playing it. That’s because the game is playable this weekend at EVO in Vegas, and while the lucky FGC die-hards in attendance are getting some hands-on time with it, the rest of us are at least getting some crumbs, seeing the game in action with a breakdown of its mechanics. If you want to watch the full guide, you can do so below. For everyone who just wants the bullet points, read on.</span></p> <p><iframe loading="lazy" title="MARVEL Tōkon: Fighting Souls Beginner's Guide" width="500" height="281" src="about:blank" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen="" data-rocket-lazyload="fitvidscompatible" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/v1c9TcMIWfA?feature=oembed"></iframe></p> <h2>You won’t have access to all four of your characters at the start of a match</h2> <p><i><span>Fighting Souls </span></i><span>is a 4v4 game, which sounds incredibly overwhelming. It still might be, but unlike </span><i><span>Marvel vs. Capcom</span></i><span>, you won’t be able to switch freely between your characters right off the bat. Matches will start as 2v2 fights, with you gradually gaining access to the other two fighters when you throw an opponent and trigger a stage transition, slam an enemy into a stage corner, or lose a round. Unlike in </span><i><span>Marvel vs. Capcom</span></i><span>, your characters don’t have separate health bars but instead share one, and building your team across a match increases the values of your Vital (aka health) and Skill Gauges, allowing you to use more special moves and assist maneuvers. This means there’s a lot of incentive to try and send your opponent flying through the stage quickly so you can build up your team as fast as possible.&nbsp;</span></p> <h2>Each fighter has a “unique” move alongside the standards</h2> <p><span>The video runs through the control scheme, and a lot of it is the kind of stuff you’d expect. You move back to block, and every character has light, medium, and heavy attacks. That’s all fighting game fundamentals. However, each character also has a “unique” move that gives them a more distinct playstyle.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><span>Here are the unique moves revealed thus far:</span></p> <ul> <li aria-level="1"><span>Captain America: He throws his shield, and it ricochets off the corners of the screen</span></li> <li aria-level="1"><span>Iron Man: Uses long-range repulsor blasts</span></li> <li aria-level="1"><span>Ms. Marvel: Pulls herself across the stage using her stretchy arms</span></li> <li aria-level="1"><span>Storm: Throws a gust of wind toward her foe</span></li> <li aria-level="1"><span>Star-Lord: Changes the element of his gun between a flamethrower and cryobeam</span></li> <li aria-level="1"><span>Doctor Doom: Create a shield that nullifies projectiles</span></li> </ul> <p><span>The video didn’t show Ghost Rider or Spider-Man’s unique moves, but I imagine we’ll hear what those are when people play </span><i><span>Fighting Souls </span></i><span>at EVO.</span></p> <p><span>While the Unique moves are special moves that are specific to each hero, they’re not the only distinguishing attacks in a character’s move pool.&nbsp; Each character has Skills you can activate that lean into their personalities and fighting styles. Captain America can do more precise shield throws, and Star-Lord can throw grenades that stun his enemies. You can use your Skill Gauge to increase their power, and if you’ve got 100 points in that gauge, you can use a Super skill. The game does a pretty sick comic-style cut-in when you use those, so </span><i><span>Fighting Souls</span></i><span> is definitely leaning into the idea of these characters as comic-book heroes first and foremost.</span></p>

 <h2>Juggling your allies might require some technical practice</h2> <p><span>The prospect of playing as four characters at once sounds pretty daunting, and Arc System Works’ breakdown of how you can utilize a full team makes it seem a lot more complex than just swapping between them at will. There are assist abilities that you can use and then swap right into the character who’s helping you out, for instance, or you can use multiple assists at once and, depending on the order in which you summon those allies, you can swap to the latest teammate you called in, and the attack they’ll use depends on which of the three slots they’re in. On top of this, there are several more powerful maneuvers your allies can help you with, such as juggling an opponent and throwing them around the screen. These attacks drain your Assemble Gauge, but help you break through enemy defenses or counter an incoming strike. You can even stack several Super Skills on top of each other if you’ve got the full gauge to do so. The “Crossover” counter mechanic feels reminiscent of </span><i><span>Street Fighter 6</span></i><span>’s Drive Impact in that it can call in an ally to defend your primary character and stun your opponent. Getting the timing down for all of these mechanics will require some practice. The sheer number of options at your disposal is pretty staggering, but I know the best in the FGC are going to perform some mindblowing combos and plays with this tech.</span></p> <p><i><span>Marvel Tōkon: Fighting Souls </span></i><span>is coming to PS5 and PC in 2026 as </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/everything-announced-all-trailers-state-of-play-ps5-ps4-1851783654"><span>part of a publishing deal with Sony</span></a><span>. The PlayStation company also owns EVO now, so it seems like it’s trying to get as many footholds in the fighting game community as it can, including funding a fighting game based on one of the biggest entertainment properties in the world.</span></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              
              <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/thps-3-4-tony-hawk-pro-skater-review-is-it-good-levels-1851786124"><i>Tony Hawk’s Pro Skater 3+4</i></a> has a sizable roster of skaters to choose from. Whether you choose from the 29 that are immediately available or go with an unlockable skater like <a href="https://kotaku.com/thps-3-4-bam-margera-how-to-unlock-easy-fast-tip-guide-1851785804">Bam Magera</a>, each one feels different thanks to a unique layout of stats.</p> <p>That might be a problem if someone you like doesn’t play as comfortably as you want. Fortunately, collectible Stat points in each level can be used to upgrade everyone on the roster. So let’s go over every stat’s purpose and which ones you should invest in first.</p> <h2>What each stat means</h2> <p>Anyone new to this series is bound to feel a little lost from the onslaught of terms and actions. There is a lot to remember from the tutorial, and ten skater stats don’t help in that regard. Here’s an explanation for what each stat determines:</p>

 <ul> <li aria-level="1"><b>Air:</b> The maximum height you get from jumping off a half pipe</li> <li aria-level="1"><b>Hangtime:</b> How long you can stay in the air after jumping off a half pipe</li> <li aria-level="1"><b>Ollie:</b> How high you jump while on flat ground</li> <li aria-level="1"><b>Speed:</b> The maximum speed you can reach on the ground</li> <li aria-level="1"><b>Spin:</b> How fast you spin while in the air</li> <li aria-level="1"><b>Switch:</b> Affects how well you skate in the alternate stance</li> <li aria-level="1"><b>Flip Speed:</b> How quickly flip tricks turn</li> <li aria-level="1"><b>Rail Balance:</b> The stability of the grinding rail meter</li> <li aria-level="1"><b>Lip Balance:</b> The stability of the Lip Trick meter</li> <li aria-level="1"><b>Manual Balance:</b> The stability of the Manual meter</li> </ul> <h2>What are the best stats to prioritize?</h2> <figure id="attachment_2000614382" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000614382"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000614382">© Screenshot: Capcom / Samuel Moreno / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p>With such a wide variety of tricks and options, every player will skate a bit differently. This is more apparent once we factor in all of the different maps. Nevertheless, some stats are more useful when you’re starting out.</p> <p><b>If you’re unsure what stats to prioritize putting points into, we suggest focusing on Air, Speed, and Rail Balance.</b> Being able to move faster and jump higher off half pipes will make a huge difference on their own, but we can’t discount how nice it feels to grind rails more easily. Manual Balance and Hangtime are some great alternate choices if the Skater you’re using already has high values in the other stats.</p>

 <p>Something else worth pointing out is that point allocation isn’t set in stone. You can remove any added points and redistribute them to your heart’s content. All you need to do is pause the game, switch over to the Skater tab with R1/RB, and then select the Stats box to edit them. This can even be done in the middle of a run, which is great if you need to readjust for a competition level or need a bit more Speed to get a Secret Tape.</p> <hr> <p><i>Tony Hawk’s Pro Skater 3+4</i> is available now on PS5, Xbox Series X/S, Nintendo Switch, and Windows PCs.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              
              <p><i>RimWorld </i>has come a long way since its initial launch in November of 2013. Back then, a lot of what made the game great today was simple and barebones. Through regular content updates and multiple expansions, the team at Ludeon Studios has crafted one of the greatest story-generating colony sim games in this niche genre. But it’s the modding community that carries the torch forward. They’ve introduced the community to total overhauls, eyebrow-raising inclusions, and, of course, the ever-beloved quality of life mods. Let’s explore a few of those that many of us long-time players can’t do without!</p> <h2>Neat Storage</h2> <figure id="attachment_2000614367" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000614367"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000614367">© Screenshot: Ludeon Studios / seobungzu</figcaption></figure> <p>One of the earliest rooms you’ll construct for your base—or, at the very least, that you should construct—is a storage room for everything you brought in the crash landing. If left outside in the weather and the fauna, your packaged food will quickly deteriorate. But no one wants to walk over junk on the floor, right?</p> <p><a href="https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3416243474&amp;searchtext=neat+storage">Neat Storage</a> enables clean, aesthetically pleasing storage solutions for everything from raw resources to clothing to weapons to body parts. The shelves are simply, <i>mwah</i>, gorgeous to look at.</p>

 <h2>Character Editor</h2> <figure id="attachment_2000614368" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000614368"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000614368">© Screenshot: Ludeon Studios / VOID</figcaption></figure> <p>You’ll encounter a wide variety of pawns during the creation process, most of which feature an abundance of quirks, high and low skills, passions, and even injuries. It’s random, and you could very easily get screwed over by the in-game character generator.</p> <p>If you’d rather have a little more agency over your colony, a tool like <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1874644848&amp;searchtext=character+editor">Character Editor</a> will allow you to completely resculpt a pawn into anything you desire. From a pyromaniac god-like character with maxed out abilities to a child warrior turned scientist incapable of cleaning or menial labor, it’s all up to you now!</p>

 <h2>Smarter Construction</h2> <figure id="attachment_2000614369" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000614369"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000614369">© Screenshot: Ludeon Studios / Hultis</figcaption></figure> <p>Let’s be honest with ourselves, pawns in <i>RimWorld </i>aren’t the sharpest tools in the shed. Sure, they’ll satiate their basic needs if left to their own devices, but for everything else, you need to take an active hand in ordering them about. If you want something built, it’s up to your planning expertise. Need a food source, yep, it’s up to you.</p> <p>Pawns tend to construct entire structures randomly, sometimes leading to roof collapses that wipe out whole colonies or trapping a pawn inside an airless room. With <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2202185773&amp;searchtext=smarter+construction">Smarter Construction</a>, those mishaps are a thing of the past. They’ll build smart, leaving paths open for trapped pawns, and construct walls and supports in such a way that solidifies the building.</p>

 <h2>Filth Vanishes With Rain and Time</h2> <figure id="attachment_2000614370" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000614370"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000614370">© Screenshot: Ludeon Studios / FrozenSnowFox</figcaption></figure> <p>Occasionally, as in rarely, I’ll play a peaceful colony that focuses on farming, ranching, or selling crafted resources like a merchant. But more often than not, <i>RimWorld </i>devolves into its usual dangerous, destructive planetary war as always. When a fight happens, all the blood, mud, and scorch marks remain until you send out your pawns to clean the place.</p> <p>But not anymore! With <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1508341791&amp;searchtext=filth+vanishes+with+rain+and+time">Filth Vanishes With Rain and Time</a>, the next time those rain clouds appear overhead, they’ll help cleanse the land and leave your settlers feeling content and devoid of dirty, germ-ridden thoughts.</p> <h2>Color Coded Mood Bar</h2> <figure id="attachment_2000614371" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000614371"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000614371">© Screenshot: Ludeon Studios / CrashM / Brandon Morgan / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p>Every minor and major incident in the game affects your pawn’s disposition. From a lack of food to too few recreational devices to a raid to discovering an underground network of tunnels leading to the ultimate bug hive beneath your base, your pawns will either roll with the punches or roll on the floor. But you can’t take steps to help them overcome such challenges with a clear head if you don’t understand their mood better.</p>

 <p>Sure, you could just go into the mood tab of their character HUD, but who has time for that? With <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2006605356">Color Coded Mood Bar</a>, a glance at the top of the screen will tell you everything you need to know. If your pawn’s portrait is red, look out!</p>  <hr> <p><i>RimWorld </i>is available now on Windows PCs, and its latest expansion, <i>Odyssey</i>, launched on July 11.</p>
