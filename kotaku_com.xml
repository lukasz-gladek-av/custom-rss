              <p><span>When you need a tool, you rarely reach for a Swiss Army Knife. It’s an option that only makes sense when you have no other options. Have you ever tried to </span><i><span>actually </span></i><span>cut wood with the shitty and very flimsy saw blade included in a Swiss Army Knife or any other similar kind of multitool? I have. It was a horrible experience, and I ended up buying a saw to finish the job. It turns out shoving many things into one package isn’t an effective way to make something good.</span></p> <p><span>Anyway, have y’all played </span><i><span>Highguard</span></i><span>?&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>Released on January 26, </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/highguard-impressions-titanfall-2-apex-multiplayer-shooter-2000663136"><i><span>Highguard </span></i></a><span>is a (</span><i><span>deep breath)</span></i><span> free-to-play fantasy-sci-fi MOBA-like 3v3 PVP hero shooter with base defense and raid mechanics. It was first unveiled as the finale of the <a href="https://kotaku.com/highguard-game-awards-trailer-rust-hero-shooter-interview-2000663137">2025 Game Awards</a> and received a less-than-stellar reaction from people online. And since then, the conversation about </span><i><span>Highguard </span></i><span>has been very strange and oddly aggressive. People taking sides. Takes being shot out like mortars across social media. It’s one of the weirdest reactions to a video game I’ve seen in many years.&nbsp;</span></p>

  <p><span>But I’m not here to talk about that </span><i><span>Highguard</span></i><span>, the one that exists online as a battlefield for takes, opinions, videos, and discourse about the discourse. I’m here to offer a critical look at the </span><i><span>actual </span></i><span>game. The thing people can play right now. And that </span><i><span>Highguard </span></i><span>is far less interesting than the conversation and the mess around it.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>That’s perhaps the biggest problem facing </span><i><span>Highguard </span></i><span>as it enters into its second week leaking players like a toddler spilling juice from their first big kid cup. It turns out </span><i><span>Highguard </span></i><span>just isn’t very interesting.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <h2><b>Bland and boring</b></h2> <p><i><span>Highguard </span></i><span>is such a boring game to look at. Developers Wildlight Entertainment seem to have been unable to decide what kind of game </span><i><span>Highguard </span></i><span>is, and the first sign of that is in how it mixes together fantasy, sci-fi, magic, and modern guns. This blending of genres and tropes can be done well, but not in </span><i><span>Highguard</span></i><span>; every asset and model has had any potential character and grit sanded down to ensure the various pieces blend together.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><span>And they do blend. Perfectly. Too perfectly.&nbsp; Nothing sticks out. There’s no charm. No quirks. Nothing to talk about with people or post online. It’s the kind of game that leaves your brain the moment you stop playing it.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>I’ve played over 14 hours of the game now across many matches, and I struggle to name a character beyond Slade, an obnoxious blonde dude who is the closest </span><i><span>Highguard </span></i><span>gets to creating something that has personality. Everybody else is a generic tough man or sneaky woman with clothing and armor that looks like what you start an RPG with, and then quickly replace.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><span>It’s a shame that </span><i><span>Highguard </span></i><span>is such a forgettable-looking game because I do think the idea of a raid shooter is a cool concept.&nbsp;</span></p> <h2><b>Let’s get ready to raid</b></h2> <p><span>When a match kicks off, you start at your base, pick a hero, and set up defensive walls. Next, you and your two teammates ride out and search for loot on the map. This mostly involves speeding around on your mount and opening chests. The other team is doing the same, and you might run into them.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>Eventually, a large sword starts to form in the world, and each team needs to get to it, grab it, and take it to the enemy base to blast open their shield dome and raid the place. Do a good job raiding and the match is over. Fail and this all repeats, but the loot in the world gets better. Once a team pulls off a successful raid, they win.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><span>This might sound complicated compared to a lot of other shooters on the market, and it does take some time to learn how this all works. But once I did, I was having some fun with </span><i><span>Highguard</span></i><span>. I always felt like my team could come back and win. We were just one awesome raid away from victory.</span></p> <div>           <ul>                           <li>                 <p>Back-of-the-box quote:</p>                 <p>“I think one of them is named… Val?

That makes sense considering the studio behind </span><i><span>Highguard </span></i><span>is made up of devs who worked on that game. </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/mining-crystals-in-highguard-is-so-damn-satisfying-ps5-pc-steam-2000663527"><span>Breaking large gems out in the world between raids is also extremely satisfying</span></a><span>. I equally enjoyed setting up defenses at my base before heading out to find upgrades. And chasing someone down on the back of a mount is thrilling and not an experience found in most other online shooters. Then you have each character’s unique powers and abilities, which can dramatically change a fight as you drop down a fireblast or whip up a big wall of ice. Oh, and there’s a whole loot economy, in which you need to balance buying better guns with making sure you have enough shields to weather future firefights. And then…</span></p>

 <h2><b>Too many moving parts</b></h2> <p><span>Well, see, we’ve reached the other major problem with </span><i><span>Highguard</span></i><span>: It is trying to be everything.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>Similar to its bland art style that makes it feel like the devs couldn’t commit to one idea and instead tossed it all in, </span><i><span>Highguard’s </span></i><span>gameplay is a grab bag of ideas and mechanics from other popular games. And while it would be cool if we could just put ice cream, pizza, wine, and meatloaf into a blender and mix it all up to get something even better, that ain’t how the world works.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>The fast, </span><i><span>Call of Duty</span></i><span>-like gunplay means you die quickly. This makes going out and getting into fights before raids a chore. The upgrade and crystal economy means you have to spend time hunting down and breaking blue rocks, which, while satisfying to smash, compelling gameplay it doesn’t make. And sure, you get some currency from defeating other players, but late-game gear costs so much and you get so little from kills that during long matches, I felt obligated to stop fighting and instead go mining. The raids, easily the best part of </span><i><span>Highguard</span></i><span>, also make mounts mostly worthless, robbing the game of one of its coolest features. And only having three players on each side makes raids feel less epic, and the bases you defend too big. (Though the devs are already playing around with <a href="https://kotaku.com/highguard-big-update-free-shooter-future-patch-notes-wildlight-2000664584">a 5v5 mode</a>, which might help.)</span></p>

 <figure id="attachment_2000663165" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000663165"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000663165">© Wildlight Entertainment</figcaption></figure> <p><span>In other words, each piece of </span><i><span>Highguard </span></i><span>often gets in the way of the other pieces and can derail the whole experience.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>Perhaps </span><i><span>Highguard </span></i><span>will receive weeks and months of updates to improve some of these problems. Perhaps it will add a 4v4 mode to make the map feel less empty. Maybe the time to kill, especially in the early part of matches, will be increased so fights last longer.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>But none of that will be able to truly fix </span><i><span>Highguard</span></i><span>. It would take a lot more work to do that. </span><i><span>Highguard </span></i><span>is a forgettable shooter that stuffs too much into one game and ends up being a sometimes fun but uneven mess. At least it’s a mess that most players won’t remember for long after they log off. </span></p>

            <guid>1421437</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><span>Bethesda is celebrating the release of </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/fallout-s2-ep6-super-mutant-character-name-2000662226"><i><span>Fallout </span></i><span>season 2’s penultimate episode</span></a><span> by thoroughly upsetting the franchise’s online multiplayer fanbase. It just released the </span><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/4250650/Fallout_76_Mojave_Bundle/"><span>Mojave Bundle</span></a><span> for </span><i><span>Fallout 76</span></i><span>: a $30 DLC pack that features some nametags, a couple of items for your in-game camp, and the NCR Ranger Power Armor worn by Maximus in the previous episode. That’s half what the entire game cost back when it launched in 2018.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>Those who stuck with </span><i><span>Fallout 76 </span></i><span>throughout its many highs and lows </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/bethesda-zenimax-fallout-76-crunch-development-1849033233"><span>in the aftermath of its very rough launch in 2018</span></a><span> aren’t impressed. The decision to lock the cool new Power Armor design behind such a pricey one-off payment has been made worse by the fact that you can’t even purchase it through the in-game microtransaction store, the Atomic Shop.</span></p>

 <p><span>That means that if you’ve been saving up your Atoms, the premium currency used to purchase items, either by completing daily and weekly challenges or by slowly accruing them through your monthly $13 Fallout 1st subscription, you’ll still have to shell out an extra $30 just to get this fancy-looking skin. All of <em>Fallout 76</em>‘s seasonal updates are free, but that’s not making it any easier to swallow for some fans.&nbsp;</span></p> <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">This is CRAZY. They love making you pay a stupid amount of money for NCR stuff. <a href="https://t.co/gfqLCuUSaR">https://t.co/gfqLCuUSaR</a> <a href="https://t.co/aXgFIYhmct">pic.twitter.com/aXgFIYhmct</a></p> <p>— RyGuy (@rydirium) <a href="https://twitter.com/rydirium/status/2016932831084114052?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 29, 2026</a></p></blockquote>  <p><span>“I can’t stay silent about how aggressively cash-grabby Bethesda has become since Microsoft acquired them,” reads </span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/1qqhysl/yeah_the_price_of_the_mojave_bundle_is_ridiculous/"><span>one post</span></a><span> over on the </span><i><span>Fallout 76 </span></i><span>subreddit. “But what makes it even worse is that the game is still full of bugs and issues that haven’t been properly addressed. Clearly, Bethesda’s focus isn’t on fixing the game or delivering a solid experience anymore – they’re just trying to squeeze every cent out of players.”</span></p>

 <p><span>As </span><a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/fallout/fallout-76-is-free-to-play-until-feb-5-but-if-you-want-that-sick-ncr-power-armor-from-the-fallout-show-its-gonna-cost-you/"><i><span>PC Gamer</span></i></a><span> pointed out, you can currently buy every single mainline </span><i><span>Fallout</span></i><span> game, from the OG </span><i><span>Fallout</span></i><span>&nbsp;all the way up to </span><i><span>Fallout 4</span></i><span> (and even </span><i><span>Fallout 76</span></i><span> itself), for less than the price of the Mojave Bundle. The fact that players who have been grinding for Atoms don’t even get a discount makes it even worse.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><span>Meanwhile, </span><i><span>Fallout 76</span></i><span> itself has been on a week-long free trial and is currently on sale for just $8. It’s almost like the $30 power armor is Bethesda trying to make it up on the back end. Genuinely impressive that they’ve managed to make Amazon look borderline charitable by comparison, considering they just dropped the first season of </span><i><span>Fallout </span></i><span>on YouTube </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/fallout-season-1-free-to-watch-youtube-prime-2000664098"><span>for free</span></a><span>.</span></p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/highguard-big-update-free-shooter-future-patch-notes-wildlight-2000664584</link>
            <guid>1421422</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>After launching on January 26, <em>Highguard</em> has struggled to keep players, according to data on SteamDB. But <a href="https://kotaku.com/highguards-patch-note-fov-ps5-crash-pc-optimization-2000664201">Wildlight isn’t giving up on the free-to-play raid shooter</a>, and has announced a big<strong>&nbsp;</strong>change for the game: a 5v5 mode.</p> <p>On Friday, Wildlight’s studio head and game director Chan Grenier <a href="https://x.com/ChadGrenier/status/2017271635712352533">teased on Twitter that a “big update”</a> about <em>Highguard</em> was coming, adding “You’ll want to see this one.” About four hours later, after some delay, that update arrived, and it was indeed a biggie. For a limited time, Highguard will offer players a 5v5 mode, a big shift from the game’s 3v3 mode, which many had criticized for being too small and sweaty.</p> <p>“We heard the feedback,” <a href="https://x.com/PlayHighguard/status/2017334052865658987">posted the official <em>Highguard</em> account</a>. “For the weekend, we are experimenting with a 5v5 Raid Mode. This is a separate playlist and not meant to replace 3’s. 3v3 Raids are still there for people who enjoy it! The lobby has been updated to allow for parties of 5 while the mode is live.”</p>

 <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">You asked, we listened</p> <p>All-new 5v5 limited time mode, playable now! ⚔️ <a href="https://t.co/wBaFZUOCeZ">pic.twitter.com/wBaFZUOCeZ</a></p> <p>— Highguard | LIVE NOW! (@PlayHighguard) <a href="https://twitter.com/PlayHighguard/status/2017333024598221040?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 30, 2026</a></p></blockquote>  <p>The new mode was added as part of a patch that is live now on consoles and PC. 5v5 will only be around for the weekend, for now, and Wildlight warns that adding more players could lead to some performance issues. Still, I’m excited to give <em>Highguard</em> another shot to see if a few more players in the game’s big empty maps could help add some excitement and take some pressure off players having to perform perfectly during team fights.</p> <p>The conversation around <em>Highguard</em> has been a mess ever since it was announced via the final teaser at the <a href="https://kotaku.com/highguard-game-awards-trailer-rust-hero-shooter-interview-2000663137">2025 Game Awards in December</a>. That trailer failed to excite people online, and a period of radio silence afterward left a big void that was filled by angry commentators, confused gamers, lots of blogs, and random takes from users on sites like Reddit and BlueSky. When it finally arrived earlier this week, it saw a huge influx of curious onlookers, nearly reaching 100k concurrent players according to SteamDB data. But just a few days later, <em>Highguard’s</em> playercount has dwindled as <a href="https://kotaku.com/highguard-already-has-over-7000-negative-reviews-on-steam-2000663220">negative reviews continue to flood the game’s Steam page</a>.</p>

 <p>Will this big change be enough to turn things around, or is <em>Highguard</em> doomed to become another flop in a long line of live-service games that have failed to survive? I’m not sure, but at the very least, it seems Wildlight Entertainment is willing to make big changes to the game to try and keep it around.</p>
