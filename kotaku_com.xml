And already people are getting prepared for it to be sold out. According to a post on Reddit (via <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/nintendo-is-reportedly-sending-out-of-stock-signs-to-switch-2-retailers/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/nintendo-is-reportedly-sending-out-of-stock-signs-to-switch-2-retailers/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>VGC</em></a></span>), gaming stores in the U.S. are being supplied with large “Out of Stock” displays for the Nintendo Switch 2, apparently sent by Nintendo itself to prepare for the forthcoming over-demand for the brand new console. Which is somehow both optimistic and pessimistic at the same time.</p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="197565" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="Nintendo Switch 2 Could Launch With Almost No Reviews" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="122" data-playlist="197565,197567,196230" data-current="197565"><div><p>Nintendo Switch 2 Could Launch With Almost No Reviews</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197565/197565_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197565/197565_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197565/197565_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/23089.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>A new console selling out on launch isn’t exactly unprecedented—2020 saw the  launches of both the Xbox Series and the PS5, where a combination of supply chain issues, covid mayhem, and shipping disasters meant shelves were bare for many months after their intended launch. But it’s still pretty novel to perhaps see the console manufacturer itself preparing for the eventuality.</p><p> And canny, too! Traditionally, when your local GameStop or Best Buy has run out of stock, you’ll be greeted either with the dead-eyed stare of beleaguered employees, or perhaps at most a hastily printed sign made in Word and stuck into a plastic stand. But something like the sizeable cardboard signs Nintendo appears to be shipping not only look far more professional, but also perform the handy task of also being giant reminders that the Switch 2 is a thing that exists.</p><p>We don’t know for sure right now that these are official Nintendo signs (although this is what the original poster claims), and reached out to those involved to try to find out. But even if it’s just something one particular chain has put together, it’s testament to just how popular the Switch 2 is going to be when it releases June 5.</p><figure id="" data-id="2f042b8b5593bf7de3a2fc54009391e3" data-recommend-id="image://2f042b8b5593bf7de3a2fc54009391e3" data-format="jpg" data-width="1315" data-height="740" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Mario runs furiously in front of messages about Switch 2 pre-order cancelations." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Mario runs furiously in front of messages about Switch 2 pre-order cancelations." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Nintendo / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="2f042b8b5593bf7de3a2fc54009391e3" data-recommend-id="image://2f042b8b5593bf7de3a2fc54009391e3" data-format="jpg" data-width="1315" data-height="740" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Mario runs furiously in front of messages about Switch 2 pre-order cancelations." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Availability of the Switch 2 feels a bit all over the place just now.

Many stores will open at midnight, the second the calendar flips over into Thursday, so customers can collect pre-orders, or attempt to snap up any consoles that have been held back to briefly decorate shelves. Everyone else will be pacing back and forth, up and down their driveway, waiting for the delivery van to show up. And when that’s done, we can all begin speculating about whether supply will recover in time for the holidays.</p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
