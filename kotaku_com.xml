It’s not clear how much of the price increases can be blamed on tariffs in the U.S. versus Microsoft trying to capitalize on Nintendo’s high price for the Switch 2 and recently breaking the $80 seal with <em>Mario Kart World</em>. Microsoft declined to comment on whether prices might come back down in the U.S. if President Trump abandons his trade war with China.</p><p>The news led “thanks Nintendo” to start trending on X today as some people blamed the Switch 2 maker for getting the ball rolling on higher prices at the start of its next console generation, while others pointed out that the bulk of gaming price hikes in the U.S. from both companies are the fault of tariffs alone. It also seems like only a matter of time before Sony follows suit, though it recently confirmed <em>Ghost of Yotei</em> will remain $70 in an April blog post, with pre-orders set to begin on May 2. Will it change its mind or take the opportunity to have one of the more competitively priced blockbusters this holiday season?</p><figure id="" data-id="83bcd5d698ddcaa87f09ae784dc211aa" data-recommend-id="image://83bcd5d698ddcaa87f09ae784dc211aa" data-format="png" data-width="720" data-height="615" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A post talks about game prices going up because of tariffs.

" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>The Xbox pricing changes are especially jarring for fans who have seen the PlayStation competitor more or less captivate this generation and seen Microsoft porting some of its biggest franchises to PS5 and Switch. <em>Forza Horizon 5</em> just arrived there this week, plus <em>Oblivion Remastered</em>, <em>Doom: The Dark Ages</em>, and <em>The Outer Worlds 2</em> are all day-and-date on multiple platforms. Once <em>Halo</em>, <em>Gears of War</em>, or<em> Starfield</em> make the jump, the prospect of paying $600 for a five-year old console with limited exclusives will be a tougher sell than ever. </p><p>Even before the Trump tariffs went into effect, the price of gaming has steadily risen throughout this console generation, due to inflation and ballooning game budgets. Sony had already raised the price of the all-digital PS5 by $50 and and subscription services like Game Pass have had multiple cost increases. It’s the first hardware cycle in memory where being there on launch day was actually <em>cheaper</em> than waiting a few years. </p><p>And what does that mean for the next Xbox and PS6? Will they be $600-700 at launch? Will new games cost closer to $100? Or will the higher cost of entry simply drive more players to cheaper alternatives like mobile and cloud gaming while sinking more time into free-to-play hangouts like<em> Fortnite </em>and <em>Roblox</em>? </p><p>.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

While you can request that the Support Ship prioritizes certain items for its next visit, its stock cycles through a pool of items. This means that Commission Tickets are not always guaranteed. It can feel like quite the rare sight to see even one at times.</p><p>Thankfully, there are ways to cheese through this and collect them all. <strong>Commission Tickets have a chance to show up when you’ve requested Equipment Materials or Misc. Items</strong>. You’ll want to request goods from those categories first. The next step to increase your chances is to purchase all the weapons you see. These are one-off items that are never replaced in stock, which means you can filter them out of the pool and make it more likely for Commission Tickets to show up.</p><p>All of this is dragged out by how long it takes to see new Support Ship stock. <strong>If you’re not feeling patient and want these materials sooner than later, you can always choose to </strong><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/monster-hunter-wilds-rest-plenty-fallow-inclemency-1851776094&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/monster-hunter-wilds-rest-plenty-fallow-inclemency-1851776094"><strong>skip ahead by resting</strong></a></span><strong>.</strong> The Support Ship weighs anchor for three days and then leaves for another three to gather items for you. It will take up to 3000 Guild Points to keep using the Rest mechanic, but it’s a lot faster than hunting for six in-game days to pass the time.</p><p><strong>My final suggestion for farming Commission Tickets is to do a bit of save scumming</strong>. Keep track of when the Support Ship will dock and save the day before. Rest in your tent to advance the day, and then go out and check what’s in stock. If there are no Commission Tickets available, return to the main menu without saving and reload your save. Keep checking the newly generated stock until it includes what you need.</p><h2 id="h460924"><a id=""></a>How to use Commission Tickets</h2><figure id="" data-id="cc71a3575eec8414e7e900de5c88d993" data-recommend-id="image://cc71a3575eec8414e7e900de5c88d993" data-format="jpg" data-width="3840" data-height="2160" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The Lance Weapon Tree screen, showing off the Paladin Lance I." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="The Lance Weapon Tree screen, showing off the Paladin Lance I." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Capcom / Samuel Moreno / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="cc71a3575eec8414e7e900de5c88d993" data-recommend-id="image://cc71a3575eec8414e7e900de5c88d993" data-format="jpg" data-width="3840" data-height="2160" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The Lance Weapon Tree screen, showing off the Paladin Lance I." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>All you’re told is to take these to the Smithy, which isn’t a helpful suggestion with how many options Gemma has. There isn’t any special interaction to look out for–<strong>Commission Tickets are just used as materials to forge specific weapons and armor</strong>. To be more precise, it’s used for two weapons, both of their upgraded forms, and a full set of armor. Here is the equipment that requires Commission Tickets:</p><ul data-type="List" data-style="Bullet"><li>Jawblade</li><li>Giant Jawblade</li><li>Paladin Lance</li><li>Babel Spear</li><li>Commission Helm Alpha</li><li>Commission Mail Alpha</li><li>Commission Vambraces Alpha</li><li>Commission Coil Alpha</li><li>Commission Greaves Alpha</li></ul><p>It’s worth crafting the armor set for the great equipment skills attached to its pieces.

Your mileage will vary with the weapons, as it likely depends on whether you enjoy using the Great Sword and Lance.
