              <p>When it comes to deckbuilding roguelites, there’s one name that tops almost every list:&nbsp;<em>Slay the Spire</em>. The incredible 2019 release from Mega Crit is still enormously popular, but six years on we’re definitely ready for its sequel. Sadly, that’s now looking like it’ll be a seven year wait, with the game’s Early Access launch delayed until next March. And no, it has nothing to do with the release of&nbsp;<em>Hollow Knight: Silksong</em>.</p> <p>Originally slated to appear this fall,&nbsp;<em>Slay the Spire 2</em> is set 1,000 years after the massive hit original, offering a more complicated path through the Spire, new characters joining the old crew, and as-yet unrevealed “new ways to play” (although the update does reveal one!). And given that the original game, six years later, still routinely sees 18-20,000 people playing every day on Steam (let alone on console and mobile), you can only imagine how many people are waiting in digital lines to be able to start playing the follow-up.</p> <p>“After a lot of internal discussion,” <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/646570/view/529856925490218829">a very lengthy update post</a> for the game begins, “we’ve made the call to move <em>Slay the Spire 2</em>‘s Early Access launch to a secret Thursday in March 2026.”</p>

 <p>“There’s no single dramatic reason,” the post continues. “Some personal life stuff hit the team (everyone’s okay!), we kept saying ‘wouldn’t it be cool if…’ one too many times, and honestly, the game just needs more polish to meet our standards.” Thus another six months development before the game reaches players.</p> <p>Knowing exactly where people’s minds would immediately go, an FAQ about the delay begins with the question, “Is the real reason for the delay the timing of the&nbsp;<em>Silksong</em> release?” But, Mega Crit insists, this had nothing to do with it.</p>

 <blockquote><p>“We got together as a team to determine our new release window before <em>Silksong</em>’s date was announced. The timing just worked out like that, but on the bright side, everyone can keep busy playing <em>Silksong</em> during the wait!”</p></blockquote> <p>The FAQ continues with an even more conspiratorial theory: that the developers are spending too much time on merch and community events. (You have to assume this is something on a forum or Discord somewhere, right?) Again, they say no.</p> <blockquote><p>“Our merch is made by 3rd party partners and our community manager is the primary liaison on our team for collabs like that. No game development was harmed in the making of those plushies! Likewise, anything community-focused that we create, participate in, or promote is generally handled by the CM and doesn’t cut into any game development time.”</p></blockquote> <p>Mega Crit also promise no radio silence between now and March. But then the post goes on to reveal a brand new&nbsp;<em>Slay the Spire 2</em> feature: “alternate acts.”</p> <blockquote><p>Once unlocked, upon entering a new act in&nbsp;<i>Slay the Spire 2</i>, you will be randomly greeted with one of two possible acts. These acts differ radically in their environments, enemies, events, and bosses, all of which greatly increase the variety of gameplay between runs. For instance, Act 1a is Overgrowth, a lush, tangled ruin with much of its fauna resembling mystical woodland creatures and sentient flora that might just eat you alive. This is the act you’ve primarily been seeing in our teasers and trailers, though there’s still plenty left to uncover here. Act 1b is known as the&nbsp;Underdock<b>s</b>, a miry waterway connected to the Spire’s sewer system, from which all manner of mutant sea creatures and vagrants might emerge. We’ve only just begun to tease the trove of content that lurks within these murky depths.</p> <p>As the mathematically-inclined among you have probably realized, that means there will be&nbsp;double the amount of content in this new act structure. We won’t be launching with all of the alternate acts right away, but Acts 2b and 3b will come later down the road in Early Access updates. The capabilities of these different enemies, the opportunities these events offer, and how they all might impact your strategy as you ascend the Spire will be seen in time.</p></blockquote> <p>The rest of the post features some superb community engagement (really, developers need to study this for a class in how to connect with customers), including player art, in-jokes, and even <a href="https://custom-connections-game.vercel.app/g14MCkop8mMRKjn3lwdZ">a <em>Connections</em> wall</a>. It’s lovely stuff, which goes some way to easing the blow of another six months to wait.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[This HP USB-C Dock 11-in-1 Adapter Keeps Dropping in Price, Now a Clearance-Level 55% Off Deal]]></title>
            <link>https://kotaku.com/this-hp-usb-c-dock-11-in-1-adapter-keeps-dropping-in-price-now-a-clearance-level-55-off-deal-2000625018</link>

              <p>See all those wires cluttering your desktop? Quick — do you know right away where all of them go, and which ones are powering or connecting what device? It sucks when the cable octopus turns into a vicious cable kraken and kills any semblance of organization on your desk, but Amazon’s running a fat deal on the ultimate clutter-killing hub: <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4084/">HP’s G5 11-in-1 dock works with any USB-C or Thunderbolt-enabled laptop or PC, and it’s never been priced lower than it is right now at just $104.</a></p>
<p>When the opportunity presents itself to give your work or gaming setup the ultimate dose of organization and power management while saving a huge 55% off the regular price of $230, you jump at it. We don’t make up the rules here, we just advise you not to break them.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4084/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Here’s the Lineup</h2>
<p>Take another look at your current setup and then read this list of available ports on the HP G5 dock. See how many of your cables will fit in this one unified power hub:</p>
<ul>
<li>2 DisplayPort 1.4</li>
<li>1 HDMI port</li>
<li>4 USB-A ports (one SuperSpeed)</li>
<li>1 RJ-45 Gig Ethernet</li>
<li>2 USB-C ports (one for data/power out, one to connect to your computer)</li>
<li>1 audio jack</li>
</ul>
<p>If your desktop or laptop is either USB-C or Thunderbolt compatible (and virtually all of them are now), the HP G5 dock will work with your machine, and work brilliantly. For charging purposes, it brings up to 100W of power to your connected devices. If you’re on a PC, your machine will still get updates pushed through the G5 dock, even if the computer is in sleep mode.</p>
<p>As for the G5 dock itself, it’s an unassuming little device despite that huge number of ports and docks. It’s just 5-by-5 inches square, and stands less than 2 inches tall, so you can tuck it away and effectively hide the source of all of your peripheral connections.</p>



<h2>Universal Appeal</h2>
<p>The HP name might make you think the G5 dock is a PC-exclusive device, but it works equally well with Macs — anything with a Thunderbolt or USB-C port, across platforms, across desktops and laptops. Anything with the prerequisite hookup can not only be given a dose of cable-management sanity, it can also become a triple-monitor productivity hive.</p>
<p>We’ve seen Amazon run deals on the HP G5 11-in-1 Dock before, and it’s been a solid recommendation every time it comes up. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4084/">But now that it’s being offered at its lowest price ever — just $104 after a huge 55% price cut</a> — we can’t recommend it more strongly than now.</p>
