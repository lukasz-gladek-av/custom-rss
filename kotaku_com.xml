              <p>Ejae, Rei Ami, and Audrey Nuna are set to perform on&nbsp;<em>The Tonight Show</em> in just a few hours, which will mark the trio’s first live performance as Huntr/x, the pop stars from <a href="https://kotaku.com/kpop-demon-hunters-best-worst-songs-soundtrack-ranking-2000616633"><em>KPop Demon Hunters</em></a>. (At least, not counting <a href="https://youtu.be/LW9QJIT_T-A?si=mK7N33Yd-8Q2GEnz">a cameo in a skit</a> during this weekend’s <em>Saturday Night Live </em>in which they didn’t even perform a full song.) But in advance of that debut performance later tonight, the band has released a new song with no fanfare, one that wasn’t featured in the Netflix musical. Or at least that’s what Spotify is currently indicating. The <a href="https://open.spotify.com/artist/2yNNYQBChuox9A5Ka93BIn?si=bD2voW0ITLeASfThiMvk-g">Huntr/x Spotify account</a> posted a song called “Mazatlan By Night” on Sunday, and it’s only accumulated about 6,000 listens so far. Considering <a href="https://kotaku.com/kpop-demon-hunters-streaming-box-office-numbers-netflix-2000622381">how big <em>KPop Demon Hunters&nbsp;</em>has become</a> in the past few months, you’d think a new song from the titular girl group would have exploded in even just a few days. So what’s up with this song? Well, for one thing, it doesn’t seem to actually be a Huntr/x song.</p> <p>Sometimes other artists’ work will appear on a group’s Spotify page if they’re featured or if one of their songs is sampled, but I’ve listened to the <em>KPop Demon Hunters&nbsp;</em>soundtrack hundreds of times and couldn’t pick out anything from this piece that would put Huntr/x anywhere near the credits. I tried using the Shazam app, which listens to music and gives you the title, and it couldn’t identify the song as anything, much less a new song by Rumi, Zoey, and Mira. This could have been uploaded to the Huntr/x account in error, or there might be something more nefarious going on. The song’s copyright is for “Diskerux Diamond,” which doesn’t bring up any search results on Google. Well, it might bring up this article now. We’ve reached out to Universal Music Group for comment on the situation and will update the story if we hear back.</p>  <p>It’s entirely possible the account was hacked and someone uploaded this song to the Huntr/x account without authorization. Or it could have been a technical error that…somehow ended up on the Spotify page of one of the biggest groups in music right now. Sorry to the 6,000 of you that listened to it expecting something new from the girls. But hey, at least we’ll get to hear them performing “Golden” live on <em>The Tonight Show</em> in a little bit.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/airpods-4-are-now-3x-cheaper-than-airpods-pro-amazon-is-offering-entry-level-clearance-prices-2000632651</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Apple just released the AirPods 4 as their latest open-ear earbuds that sit outside your ear canal rather than sealing inside it like in-ear models. Compared to the newly launched AirPods Pro 3, the standard AirPods 4 cost three times less while the AirPods 4 with active noise cancellation come in at more than half the price. But those savings only apply if you snag them <strong>during Prime Big Deal Days on Amazon</strong>, where Prime members <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3769/">can grab the standard version for $89 instead of $129</a>, or <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4602/">upgrade to the ANC model for $119 down from $179</a>. You’re essentially getting premium Apple earbuds at budget earbud pricing.</p>

<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4602/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See AirPods 4 with ANC at Amazon</a></p>

<p>Open-ear mode appeals to<strong> individuals who don’t like in-ear tips for longer wear times</strong> or prefer remaining attentive to their environments instead of switching between transparency modes. They sit comfortably in your outer ear, not pressing down nor giving that stuffed-up feeling sealed tips tend to produce. The new shape accommodates a broader geometry of ears compared to older AirPods, and fixes one of the largest gripes about prior versions falling off during exercise.</p>
<h2>High-End Features That Could Use a Refresh</h2>
<p>The H2 chip drives both models and offers huge upgrades compared to the H1 chip found in prior AirPods. The newer processor <strong>supports complex computational audio processing</strong>, which supports <strong>Advanced Audio and Personalized Spatial Audio</strong>, both of which involve some serious real-time math. The H2 chip also enhances battery life, supporting the <strong>lengthy 30-hour total listening time</strong> if you count the charging case. The headphones themselves last about five hours per charge, and the case yields several additional charges before it itself must be recharged.</p>



<p><strong>Personalized Spatial Audio creates a three-dimensional soundstage</strong> which adds immersion to music, movies, and games. Head tracking is used to anchor sound to space so if your head moves when looking at a video, sound appears to remain affixed to your monitor rather than moving along with your head. Apple adjusts this setting per your actual ear geometry, gathered by your TrueDepth camera on your iPhone, for improved tailoring of the spatial effect for how your own ear shape affects perceived sound.</p>
<p>The ANC version implements <em>Active Noise Cancellation</em> which is impressive for an open-ear model. Standard ANC is optimized for sealed-in in-ear tips that quiet sound passively before it’s quieted electronically by the electronics. Apple designed a solution to actively cancel external sound even for an open-ear model by employing sophisticated algorithms and processing of the H2 chip. The payoff won’t be equivalent to AirPods Pro’s isolation, but it does a great job of cutting down on background sound in places like a coffee shop or bus/subway ride.</p>



<p>Transparency Mode allows you to easily discern what’s going on around you if you require awareness for sake of safety, for example, or for conversation. As opposed to just silencing your sound, Transparency Mode actually processes external sound so it’s normal-sounding but your music stays playing softly in the background.</p>
<p>Pairing with iPhone occurs automatically by way of Apple’s pairing process: Lift the case by your iPhone and a connection notice pops up automatically. Your AirPods then synchronize on all your Apple devices signed into a single iCloud account, switching automatically between your iPhone, iPad, and Mac as you transition between devices.</p>
<p>At $89 for the standard version and $119 for the model including ANC during Prime Big Deal Days, you’re getting Apple’s new earbud technology at prices comparable to generic Bluetooth earbuds. Those are all-time-low prices for getting high-end elements available without typical Apple markup.</p>

              <p><span>In a move that sounds custom-made to tick every box of your parents’ SEO, Jimmy Fallon is producing a </span><i><span>Wordle</span></i><span> game show. Is that not just </span><i><span>Wheel of Fortune</span></i><span>, you ask? I mean, yeah, kinda.</span></p> <p><span>If you somehow haven’t heard of </span><i><span>Wordle</span></i><span>, it started as a browser-based word game in 2021, which blew up so fast that </span><i><span><a href="https://kotaku.com/new-york-times-nyt-games-wordle-connections-app-1851379895">The</a> <a href="https://kotaku.com/new-york-times-nyt-games-wordle-connections-app-1851379895">New York Times</a></span></i><span>‘ games section acquired it in 2022. Now it’s the centerpiece of the </span><i><span>Times</span></i><span>’ much more high-profile gaming offerings, and it has inspired hundreds of copycat games. The premise is simple: the player has to guess a five-letter word in up to six attempts, with correct letters being marked green or yellow, depending on if they’re in the right spot or not. It’s a simple brain teaser that is easy to pick up and put down every day, so its virality is easy to understand. The question is: How will Fallon and company expand this into a full-blown game show?</span></p>   <p><a href="https://deadline.com/2025/10/wordle-tv-series-jimmy-fallon-pilot-nbc-1236569567/"><i><span>Deadline</span></i></a><span> reports that the series, if picked up, will air on NBC, and would give Fallon yet another gig on the network to go along with his hosting of </span><i><span>The Tonight Show</span></i><span>, the reality series </span><i><span>On Brand</span></i><span>, and the musical game program </span><i><span>That’s My Jam</span></i><span>. </span><i><span>Today</span></i><span> anchor Savannah Guthrie is signed on to host the </span><i><span>Wordle</span></i><span> pilot. The show is filming in the UK thanks to Fallon’s Electric Hot Dog production company, and that’s about all we know right now. Is it just going to be guests solving five-letter word puzzles like those in the existing game? That doesn’t sound like quite enough for a full-fledged game show, so I expect there will be more to it than that. Will the players who end up on the show spell out the words “Authoritarian Regime”? </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/jimmy-kimmel-fallon-colbert-stewart-trump-kirk-2000627249"><span>Probably not on Fallon’s watch</span></a><span>. That’s also too many letters for a game of </span><i><span>Wordle</span></i><span>. </span></p>

              <p>More games are coming out than ever before. <a href="https://kotaku.com/steam-19-000-new-games-limited-pc-valve-unplayed-80-1851738322">Over 18,000 separate store listings</a> were added to Steam in 2024 alone. Our list of notable October releases hit 55, and there were dozens more games we could have included. It’s a good thing that with the market so flooded, the average gamer is also buying tons of games. Oh wait, they aren’t! A new survey by Circana finds the majority of players in the U.S. buy just two games a year or fewer.</p> <p>That data point was <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/matpiscatella.bsky.social/post/3m27zezw2ek2v">shared last week</a> (via <em><a href="https://newsletter.gamediscover.co/p/sept-2025s-top-new-steam-and-console?utm_campaign=email-half-post&amp;r=7owge&amp;token=eyJ1c2VyX2lkIjoxMjkxOTExOCwicG9zdF9pZCI6MTc1NDM3NzY3LCJpYXQiOjE3NTk4NjIyODQsImV4cCI6MTc2MjQ1NDI4NCwiaXNzIjoicHViLTE0MDg5Iiwic3ViIjoicG9zdC1yZWFjdGlvbiJ9.P7-FDk_km-Lb5u7RkPNCSLloq8feyciLH5rCuGYy4ew&amp;utm_source=substack&amp;utm_medium=email">GameDiscoverCo</a></em>) by the firm’s head of gaming research, Mat Piscatella. The group’s upcoming Future of Games report for the last quarter asked respondents how often they purchased new games. A whopping third said they don’t even buy one a year. Only 4 percent purchase more than one game a month. Did you buy <em>Hollow Knight: Silksong</em> and<em> Borderlands 4</em> in September? Congratulations: you are a statistical outlier.</p>

 <p>Piscatella was presenting the data in the context of the recent Game Pass price hikes. While most players barely buy games at all, a small fraction of them spend a ton. “Hyper enthusiast, price-insensitive players are really keeping things going, especially in the non-free-to-play gaming space,” he wrote. We can imagine this as the group who’s going to buy every game on their most-anticipated list no matter what. In fact, they might even buy the Deluxe Edition.</p> <div><blockquote data-bluesky-uri="at://did:plc:bhqrrxt7yyfpwguioa7rwa7x/app.bsky.feed.post/3m27zezw2ek2v" data-bluesky-cid="bafyreigtnlcxloqjvmbylrdg2jzzq4x6qlon6az44xwjvfajx6viqo7h3m"> <p lang="en">Hyper enthusiast, price-insensitive players are really keeping things going, especially in the non f2p gaming space.</p> <p>According to Circana's Q3 2025 Future of Games, only 4% of US video game players buy a new game more often than once per month, with a third of players not buying any games at all.</p> <p>— <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/did:plc:bhqrrxt7yyfpwguioa7rwa7x?ref_src=embed">Mat Piscatella (@matpiscatella.bsky.social)</a> <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/did:plc:bhqrrxt7yyfpwguioa7rwa7x/post/3m27zezw2ek2v?ref_src=embed">2025-10-02T16:54:18.096Z</a></p></blockquote></div>  <p>You can see this in the recent financial data for gaming companies like Sony. Despite console adoption stalling, <a href="https://kotaku.com/xbox-perfect-dark-halo-gears-war-fable-ps5-1851785732">they keep making more profit</a> on the same existing slice of fans. While some people buy a Switch 2, PlayStation 5 or Xbox Series X/S and only ever buy a handful of games for it, others are content to keep adding to their backlog, a niche concept as foreign to the average gamer as the Criterion closet is to most people who subscribe to Netflix.</p>

 <p>We often think of the gaming as, broadly speaking, evenly divided and homogenous. We take the median player and imagine an entire audience made up of them, as opposed to the market being defined by lots of different groups of players with unique habits, tastes, and conceptions of the hobby. It’s also easy to see why game studios have gotten so precious about release windows. If the majority of people are only going to buy a couple of games of year, best not to go head-to-head with <em>Call of Duty</em>, <em>Madden</em>, or the next <em>Grand Theft Auto</em>.</p> <p>One obvious solution to this problem? Better curation and discovery. There’s only too many games if you can’t help the right people find the right ones. Valve has put a lot of work into exploring that problem and Steam is still far from perfect. The rest of the platforms, sadly, aren’t even close. And mobile, the biggest platform of all, is the worst of the bunch.</p>

              <p>The next mainline <i>Resident Evil</i> game is months away, and the hype among devoted fans is likely as contagious as a well-designed Umbrella Corp. bio-weapon. <i>Requiem</i> doesn’t just look the part of a dark and violent survival horror game; the developers have made it clear that <a href="https://kotaku.com/resident-evil-requiem-9-2-4-horror-scary-grace-2000630216"><i>Requiem </i>really wants to scare you,</a> unlike some previous <i>RE</i> titles that were more action-oriented. And with its return to the iconic series’ location of Raccoon City, <i>Requiem </i>is sure to make <i>RE</i> lore enthusiasts eager to sink their teeth into every new detail it reveals in the series’ larger canon.</p> <p><i>Resident Evil</i> has been with us since 1996. Since then, it’s become one of the most iconic and celebrated survival horror series out there, and deservedly so with its iconic cast of heroes and villains. Though some entries haven’t landed as well with hardcore fans, the series has arguably been riding high since 2017’s <i>Resident Evil 7 Biohazard</i>. And it didn’t stop there; a series of successful remakes of games from the series’ glory years in the ‘90s and 2000s have also served as reminders that when <i>Resident Evil</i> is firing on all cylinders, it’s a force to be reckoned with.</p>

 <p><i>Resident Evil: Requiem</i>, also known as <i>Resident Evil 9</i>, launches on PS5, Xbox Series X/S, <a href="https://kotaku.com/resident-evil-requiem-switch-2-release-date-re7-2000625335">Switch 2</a>, and Windows PCs on February 27, 2026. Officially announced and shown off <a href="https://kotaku.com/re9-resident-evil-9-trailer-teaser-sgf-summer-game-fest-1851783941">during Summer Game Fest</a>, the game will follow the story of Grace Ashcroft as she revisits the nightmares of her past in her official duties as a technical analyst for the FBI.</p>

 <p><b>Read More:</b> <a href="https://kotaku.com/a-bunch-of-resident-evil-games-are-reportedly-getting-switch-2-ports-2000624442">A Bunch Of <i>Resident Evil</i> Games Are Reportedly Getting Switch 2 Ports</a></p> <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/resident-evil-requiem-9-grace-trailer-gamescom-mother-2000618547">Grace’s past isn’t something she’s keen to relive</a>. Unlike many other <i>RE</i> protagonists, she’s hardly battle-hardened. But she’s certainly had her own experiences with the series’ legendary violent threats, so she’s not a total newbie. Still,<i> Requiem</i> is ambitious for its use of a new protagonist and a return to an iconic city. So, what can we expect when the game arrives in 2026? Let’s go over everything we’ve learned about this highly anticipated sequel.</p>

 <h2><i>Requiem</i> will embrace both first- and third-person</h2> <p><i>Resident Evil 7 Biohazard</i> was the first mainline <i>RE</i> game to pivot exclusively to a first-person perspective (though the series had had its share of first-person action in earlier spin-offs). Its follow-up, <i>Village</i>, started off in first-person but eventually introduced a third-person option. <a href="https://kotaku.com/re9-resident-evil-requiem-first-third-person-option-ps5-1851784320"><i>Requiem</i> will allow you to switch between first- and third-person perspectives at launch</a>.</p>

 <p><b>Read More:</b> <a href="https://kotaku.com/re9-resident-evil-requiem-first-third-person-option-ps5-1851784320"><i>Resident Evil 9</i> Lets You Swap Between First-Person And Third-Person Whenever You Want</a></p> <p><i>Biohazard</i> made a compelling case for <i>RE</i> in first-person (even if it did feel like an answer to <a href="https://kotaku.com/od-hideo-kojima-productions-silent-hill-pt-game-awards-1851089141">Hideo Kojima’s wildly popular <i>Silent Hills</i> demo</a> that <a href="https://kotaku.com/nobody-actually-knows-how-they-solved-the-silent-hill-t-1621044581">had everyone terrified at the time</a>), so it feels appropriate for the series to carry on with it. But after three remakes (<i>2</i>, <i>3</i>, and <i>4</i>), it’s clear that surviving <i>RE</i>’s environments in third-person is also a treat. How then, could we possibly choose between them?</p>

 <p>The gameplay sounds promising. Thanks to a playable demo available during Gamescom earlier this year, some folks got a taste of the action. It seems clear that first-person amplifies the fear, but third-person will still be a spooky good time.</p>

  <p>The demo featured a flashback scene in which Grace is without a gun to wield and the experience to wield it. <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/resident-evil-9-requiem-hands-on-preview"><i>IGN</i>’s Matt Kim</a> described a chase sequence in which Grace has nothing but empty bottles to throw at one of <i>RE</i>’s most terrifying creatures yet.</p> <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/onimusha-way-sword-pragmata-resident-evil-9-preview-2000618849"><i>Kotaku</i>’s Kenneth Shepard described his time</a> with the demo as featuring more “hide-and-seek horror” than the likes of the series’ eighth entry, <i>Resident Evil Village</i>. “It felt like the game had been stripped down to its core elements to leave you with a terrifying helplessness.”</p> <h2><i>Requiem</i> is about ‘addictive fear’</h2> <p>In a special <a href="https://youtu.be/-hiC3qpghP0">‘Creators’ Message’ video from Capcom last June</a>, <i>Requiem</i>’s director Koshi Nakanishi described the philosophy behind <i>Requiem</i>, and it’s all about establishing an emotional contour that fans of survival horror know very well:</p>

 <blockquote><p>Our core concept for this game was “addictive fear.” There’s something about the catharsis you get from overcoming your fears. It creates an addiction that makes you want to do more, to play more. That intense focus, while scary, makes for a really fun game. This served as our launching point for <i>Requiem</i>.</p></blockquote> <p>While <i>RE</i> has largely course-corrected itself back toward horror starting with <i>Biohazard</i> in 2017, this is still music to the ears of us survival horror fans. Of <i>RE</i>’s large cast of characters, many are exceedingly proficient with firearms and, by now, are well acquainted with surviving hordes of zombies and lumbering giants eager to stalk them. Grace, then, with her comparative lack of experience, enters as a way to allow players’ fears to synergize with the character’s emotional state.</p> <h2><i>Requiem</i> wants to avoid just letting you shoot your way through zombies</h2> <p>Originally, <a href="https://automaton-media.com/en/news/resident-evil-requiems-decision-to-scrap-leon-kennedy-as-a-playable-character-shows-the-franchise-is-finally-stepping-away-from-hardened-and-stoic-protagonists/">Capcom thought to center series legend Leon Kennedy</a>, the main character of <i>RE4</i> and co-protagonist of <i>RE2</i> and <i>6</i>, in <i>Requiem</i>. But given how experienced (and likely PTSD-ridden) Kennedy is, it didn’t seem to be a good fit. In the “Creator’s Message” video from last summer, Nakanishi said of Leon Kennedy:</p>

 <blockquote><p>Making a horror game based around [Leon] is difficult. He wouldn’t jump at something like a bucket falling. No one wants to see Leon scared by every little thing. So he’s actually quite a bad match for horror.</p></blockquote> <p>That’s how we got our new girl, Grace, as our protagonist for <i>Requiem</i>. But though we have a fresh face ready to scream in terror, <i>Requiem</i> is hoping to avoid just building up to a shooting spree with every baddie. “Of course, there will be boss battles,” <a href="https://automaton-media.com/en/news/resident-evil-requiems-boss-battles-will-be-more-like-the-originals-and-re2s-but-will-still-include-several-new-combat-options/">Nakashi told <i>Automaton</i></a> in a joint interview at Tokyo Game Show this year. He continued:</p> <blockquote><p>However, rather than defeating enemies in a flashy manner as you progress through the game, like in games that emphasize gun-shooting action, the style is more like <i>Resident Evil </i>and <i>Resident Evil 2</i>, where players expand their exploration area in a closed space and overcome obstacles using their wits.</p></blockquote> <h2><i>Requiem</i> sounds like a perfect excuse to go back and play every <i>Resident Evil</i> game</h2> <p><i>Requiem</i> will arrive just before <i>Resident Evil</i> celebrates its 30th birthday. Director Nakanishi has stated that the title itself is intended “to mark a milestone in the series” with its return to Raccoon City, where everything in the game’s fictional universe started. The team sees the game as a “requiem, a eulogy to those who came before.”</p>  <p>So if there was ever a <i>Resident Evil</i> game to make you go back and play through the series to prepare, it sounds like <i>Requiem</i>, arriving just before the series’ third decade, is the game to do that with.</p>

 <h2>Hey, what about those rumors you’re seeing on the internet?</h2> <p>If you have a working internet connection and the ability to type <i>Resident Evil: Requiem</i> into a search bar, you’ve likely seen alleged leaks and speculation about the game. Video games are fertile ground for wild theories and some folks have gone a little overboard with such things.&nbsp; <i>Requiem</i>’s producer, Masata Kumazawa, is well aware of this.</p> <p><a href="https://www.thegamer.com/resident-evil-requiem-director-reveals-who-mysterious-hooded-character-is/">In an interview with <i>The Gamer</i></a>, Kumazawa said the following:</p> <blockquote><p>I would like everyone to remember, let’s calm down a bit–what we’ve shown you so far is everything we can say. People get frustrated with us, because even though we didn’t promise things, the rumors and theories were such that they were widely believed.</p></blockquote> <p>So yeah, the game ain’t that far away. Let’s relax with the speculation.</p> <hr> <p>Speaking for myself, I don’t think I’ve been this excited about a <i>Resident Evil</i> game since <i>RE4</i>. Hopefully the game lives up to that excitement when it arrives in February of 2026. Now, if you’ll excuse me, I have a few missing entries in the <i>Resident Evil</i> catalog to catch up on.</p>

              <p>Current Game Pass Ultimate subscribers <a href="https://kotaku.com/xbox-game-pass-ultimate-price-hike-cod-2000632122">are getting hit with the new 50-percent price hike</a> on November 4, but only in some countries. Microsoft recently confirmed that fans in places like Poland and Korea can remain at the lower monthly price if they stay subscribed. Not so for Xbox users in the U.S.</p> <p>The confusion started when some fans started sharing the emails they’d received from Microsoft about Game Pass Ultimate going from $20 a month to $30. While some of those messages informed players about a price hike they’d see next time they renewed their subscription, others were told the pricing wouldn’t change unless they ended their subscriptions and later resumed them. Microsoft has now confirmed that the delay is only for users in some markets like Austria, Germany, Ireland, Israel, Korea, Poland, and India. Players in the U.S. and UK will see the changes take affect as planned on November 4.</p>  <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">Is that one real. I got one saying tough it’s going up. <a href="https://t.co/EHbqiWvCr8">pic.twitter.com/EHbqiWvCr8</a></p> <p>— I play games (@G_Obertron) <a href="https://twitter.com/G_Obertron/status/1975558838607839518?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 7, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <div> <p>“Our recent Game Pass update remains unchanged. Current subscribers in certain countries will continue renewing at their existing price for now, in line with local requirements. We’ll provide advance notice before price adjustments take effect in these countries,” Kari Perez, head of Xbox communications, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/794032/microsoft-xbox-game-pass-ultimate-price-changes-countries">told <em>The Verge</em></a> in a new statement.</p> <p>Why the discrepancy? Some have been speculating it has to do with local laws restricting how companies can hike subscription prices and the amount of heads-up they have to give consumers. Either way, it’s a bummer for any Xbox fan in the U.S. who thought they might be getting an unexpected reprieve from the latest Xbox price hikes. Microsoft also recently confirmed that Game Pass subscribers are <a href="https://kotaku.com/black-ops-7-game-pass-call-duty-points-discount-changes-2000631483">no longer eligible for 10 percent off of DLC</a> and other add-on content. That perk’s been replaced by an overhauled rewards program.</p> </div>
