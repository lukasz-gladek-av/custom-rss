And that’s really depressing to think about considering how bad 2023 was for game developers and the media covering the industry. Still, even a shitty year can have nice moments and wonderful surprises.</p><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/baldur-s-gate-3-alan-wake-musical-unions-peaches-blade-1851116121&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/baldur-s-gate-3-alan-wake-musical-unions-peaches-blade-1851116121">So as we have done before</a></span>, let’s highlight some of the best video game-related surprises in 2024. The stuff that keeps us going. That makes a terrible, horrible year a bit more manageable. I’m not saying a great game coming out of nowhere or a cool announcement happening can fix anything, but it can at least distract us from all the bad news out there. And that’s something, I think.</p></div></div><div><p>It’s hard to remember a time before <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/balatro-poker-roguelike-worth-it-is-it-good-review-pc-1851283124&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/balatro-poker-roguelike-worth-it-is-it-good-review-pc-1851283124"><em>Balatro</em></a></span>, but it did exist.

For about three years, after its 2019 announcement, people waited and waited until 2022 finally came along and let them play <em>Elden Ring.</em> I think most assumed a similar wait would follow for a sequel, but instead, a<span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/elden-ring-nightreign-multiplayer-release-date-trailer-1851720335&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/elden-ring-nightreign-multiplayer-release-date-trailer-1851720335"> spin-off co-op sequel was announced in December</a></span> and will be out in 2025. Nice!</p></div><div><p>While you always hope a new video game will be good, sometimes it’s hard not to get nervous or cynical. That was the case with <em>Indiana Jones and the Great Circle </em>ahead of its December release. </p><p>While I wanted the game to be great, I was nervous. How would a first-person <em>Indiana Jones </em>game work? I wasn’t sure. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/indiana-jones-great-circle-review-is-it-good-pc-xbox-1851717174&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/indiana-jones-great-circle-review-is-it-good-pc-xbox-1851717174">Then I (and others) played <em>Great Circle</em></a></span><em> </em>and discovered a really special game that plays more like <em>Dishonored </em>or <em>Hitman </em>than<em> Call of Duty</em> or <em>Uncharted</em>.

However, what I didn’t expect was for Sega to make an entire event out of finally giving the brooding black hedgehog his due.</p><p>In April, Sega announced that 2024 would be the <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/shadow-the-hedgehog-fearless-sonic-movie-3-generations-1851398367&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/shadow-the-hedgehog-fearless-sonic-movie-3-generations-1851398367">Year of Shadow</a></span>.

After the series made a hard pivot away from its ensemble cast to focus mostly on Sonic and his inner circle, Shadow had become a bit player in most games. Seeing Sega do right by him and make such a grand spectacle of it was easily one of the biggest surprises for <em>Sonic </em>fans this year. And hey, it looks like he’ll be part of the live-action movies in the future as well, so Sega can’t just abandon him again. - Kenneth Shepard</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="6d3c559643b3ad87a747f7b9c9d0acfb" data-recommend-id="image://6d3c559643b3ad87a747f7b9c9d0acfb" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="An image shows John Marston from RDR.

But it was still annoying that the legendary open-world game wasn’t available on PC. That finally changed this year, with a solid PC port of<em> Red Dead Redemption</em>. At last, you can play this classic game at high framerates and long draw distances. Oh and you can mod it and make it even better, too. Fantastic! </p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="2493f761eed24e810247ec3a0cdf6391" data-recommend-id="image://2493f761eed24e810247ec3a0cdf6391" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="720" data-lightbox="false" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->GOG</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="2493f761eed24e810247ec3a0cdf6391" data-recommend-id="image://2493f761eed24e810247ec3a0cdf6391" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="720" data-lightbox="false" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>When Good Old Games launched in 2008, the number one issue on PC games players’ minds was DRM. Digital Rights Management was throttling video games, making official, paid-for games work far worse than pirated versions, and it was a whole, grisly mess. Good Old Games launched from the studios of CD Projekt in Poland as a store that revived classic games, got them to work on modern machines, and freed them of all DRM. And the people celebrated.</p><p>As time went on, the store shifted to selling more modern games alongside classics, and dropped the name in favor of its acronym, GOG. While it maintained the no-DRM rule (beyond a couple of controversies), it also somewhat lost its purpose.

If they stick to it, if the commitment is for real, this could set a new standard that other companies may feel compelled to follow. - John Walker</p></div></div><div><p>It’s always been an odd, contentious thing in the <em>Legend of Zelda </em>fandom that the series is named after its titular princess but she rarely plays a starring role. There was hope up to the eleventh hour that <em>Tears of the Kingdom </em>would let players actually inhabit Princess Zelda as they explored its open world, but it wasn’t meant to be. </p><p>However, in 2024, we finally got a mainline <em>Zelda </em>game that lets you play as the leading lady.</p><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/legend-zelda-echoes-wisdom-review-switch-1851657826&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/legend-zelda-echoes-wisdom-review-switch-1851657826"><em>The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom</em></a></span> is one of the last big hurrahs for the Switch as we head into next year and Nintendo releases the long-awaited successor. The game is a bit divisive, replacing protagonist Link’s typical sword-and-board gameplay for a magic-based “echoes” system used more for puzzle solving than scrapping it up. But hey, fans had been asking for a Zelda-led <em>Zelda</em> game for ages, and hopefully, this is a sign that more could come in the future. - Kenneth Shepard</p></div><div><p>This year was the 30th anniversary of PlayStation.

In breathtaking fashion, 60 seconds of Season 1‘s final episode ask a terrifying question: What if the war with thinking machines isn’t over yet?</p><p>In the season finale, Sister Tula (Olivia Williams) and Sister Nazir (Karima McAdams) discover that the virus Hart has been whistling into people’s bodies, like a maniacal Pied Piper, feeds off of people’s fear. The virus burns the infected from the inside, attacking the amygdala, its power increasing as the victim succumbs to more fear. It’s still unclear how it may spread, or why nearly all of the Bene Gesserit in training were able to all have the same nightmares in past episodes. But, when we do find out what it is they’re seeing, the entire <em>Dune</em> universe is flipped upside down.</p><p>After confronting Hart near the end of the episode, Mother Superior Valya Harkonnen (Emily Watson) is able to fend off the virus, preventing it from feasting on her fears, and finally sees those glowing eyes shrouded in darkness that everyone infected were seeing. She, and everyone else, saw Hart’s traumatic experience of being swallowed by Shai-Hulud and then having the virus implanted into his right eye by a thinking machine while being watched by a shadowy figure. Unless Hart was devoured and then transported elsewhere, or never truly devoured at all, this would all but confirm that thinking machines had put Shai-Hulud under their control. </p><p>Their collaboration would make a lot of sense. When, in the penultimate episode, the spirit of Mother Superior Raquella Berto-Anirul (Cathy Tyson), in control of the body of her descendant Lila (Chloe Lea), examines the brain of Sister Kasha—Hart’s first Bene Gesserit victim—she sees a resemblance to a bioweapon used by thinking machines to kill humans by attacking their livers. Also, in the series premiere, Mother Superior Raquella, while on her deathbed decades before the events of <em>Dune: Prophecy</em>, saw a vision of the same burning flesh that resulted from anyone infected by Hart’s virus. She had that vision right after seeing Shai-Hulud devour Wallach IX, the home of the Sisterhood.</p><h2 id="h192037"><a id=""></a>This Changes A Lot For Season 2 And Next <em>Dune</em> Movie </h2><figure id="" data-id="5d13e1786dccb6b47879a01b2dcde1c0" data-recommend-id="image://5d13e1786dccb6b47879a01b2dcde1c0" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="960" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Three people walking into Arrakis" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Three people walking into Arrakis" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Courtesy of HBO</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="5d13e1786dccb6b47879a01b2dcde1c0" data-recommend-id="image://5d13e1786dccb6b47879a01b2dcde1c0" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="960" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Three people walking into Arrakis" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>It’s a good thing HBO let the world know the series was renewed for a <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/dune-prophecy-season-2-hbo-bebe-gesserit-news-1851725756&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/dune-prophecy-season-2-hbo-bebe-gesserit-news-1851725756">second season</a></span> before the season finale aired, because there would’ve been online riots demanding more episodes after the cliffhangers it leaves us with otherwise. In the season’s final moments, Tula reveal to Valya that Hart is the child whose death she lied to her sister about, and Valya embarks on an expedition trip to Arrakis with Princess Ynez Corrino (Sarah-Sofie Bousnina) and Kieran Atreides (Chris Mason). Those moments, in conjunction with the Shai-Hulud twist, show that <em>Dune: Prophecy</em>’s next season could be what sets up the Fremen being included in the show after an entire season of their absence. It also sets the stage for the next season to begin explaining how the Harkonnen and Atreides went from mortal enemies to collaborators in birthing the Messiah to lead humanity. </p><p>But this revelation of the thinking machines’ integration with Shai-Hulud also means the next season will likely see a showdown between the Bene Gesserit and the thinking machines. Valya remarks that the sisterhood came to Arrakis because “the path to our enemy begins here,” foreshadowing future conflict. As for the next <em>Dune </em>movie, the <em>Prophecy </em>season finale opens the door for the possibility that the sandworms that govern Arrakis in the films could still have a connection to thinking machines that has either been neutralized over the last 10,000 years, repurposed for their own benefits, or a combination of both. The prospect of thinking machines operating on humans inside of Shai-Hulud, not unlike the Fremen using the sandworms as transportation, opens the door for the possibility of some entity controlling those sandworms for their own motive. That person could possibly be Paul Atreides (Timothée Chalamet) when he fully becomes the Messiah.</p><p>It also can’t be a coincidence that the first person used by Shai-Hulud and thinking machines to bring Mother Superior Raquella’s destructive prophecy to fruition is the son of a Harkonnen and an Atreides, just like Paul Atreides is in the films. That, and Kieran embarking on an expedition with the current Mother Superior and the Bene Gesserit’s selection for ruler of the Imperium, could ultimately end up being footnotes in a long Atreides history that is glossed over in blood by the events of the next <em>Dune </em>movie. But the <em>Dune: Prophecy</em> season finale could foreshadow the lasting effects of the thinking machines’ virus, including it being genetically passed on in some fashion. </p><p>Does it sound far-fetched that thinking machines would embed a dormant contingency plan in the bloodline of a family set to birth the Messiah? Sure. Does it sound more far-fetched than thinking machines operating on a human being inside of a giant sandworm, infecting that person with a virus that feeds on fear? Absolutely not. We’ll just have to wait and see what <em>Dune: Prophecy</em> has done to the <em>Dune</em> universe.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
