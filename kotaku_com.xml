              <p>Dyson still sells older models like the V8 that launched nearly a decade ago, but if you want cleaning power that really removes embedded dirt from carpets, you need something more recent with stronger suction and better brush technology. The newest Gen5 models cost around $1,000 which feels excessive for a vacuum regardless of how good it performs so finding middle ground makes sense for most households.</p>
<p>The Dyson V11 Origin hits that sweet spot with powerful suction and modern features without the premium flagship pricing and <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4478/">Amazon just dropped it to $399 for Cyber Monday weekend, down from the usual $629</a>. This marks a record low for post-Black Friday clearance and offers 37% off one of Dyson’s most capable cordless vacuums.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4478/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>185 Air Watts That Clean Carpets Deeply</h2>
<p>The <strong>Dyson V11 has 185 air watts of suction power</strong> which is 60% more than earlier V-series models, and it has enough power to pull dirt that is stuck in carpet fibers that other cordless vacuums leave behind. The motorbar cleaner head has a<strong> motorized brush bar with anti-tangle technology</strong> that actively removes hair that has gotten stuck in it while you clean. This means you won’t have to cut hair off the roller every few days which is a pain, and it is very important if you have pets or long hair in the house because regular brush bars turn into useless tangles of hair after a week of use.</p>



<p>You can<strong> choose between three power modes to control the balance</strong> between suction strength and runtime. Auto mode automatically changes the power level based on the type of floor and the amount of dirt, giving you the best cleaning while using the least amount of battery power for everyday tasks. By lowering suction, Eco mode can extend runtime by up to 60 minutes which is great for quick touch-ups or cleaning big areas with light dirt. When you have to clean up a lot of tracked-in mud or pet accidents, boost mode gives you the most suction for about five minutes. The <strong>LCD screen shows the current power mode</strong>, how much time is left until the battery runs out (down to the second), maintenance alerts when the filters need to be cleaned and blockage alerts when something blocks the system.</p>
<p>The hair screw tool has a conical brush bar that is made to spiral long hair and pet hair into the collection bin without getting tangled: It makes it very useful for cleaning upholstery, stairs, and car interiors where pet hair gets stuck deep down. The crevice tool can get into tight spaces between cushions and along baseboards. The mini soft dusting brush, on the other hand, is great for cleaning delicate surfaces like lampshades and keyboards<strong>. In just a few seconds, you can also switch to handheld mode by taking off the wand</strong>.</p>



<p>Advanced <strong>whole-machine filtration catches 99.99% of particles as small as 0.3 microns</strong> and keeps allergens, dust mites, and pet dander inside the sealed system instead of letting them back into the air. People with allergies will benefit greatly from this HEPA-level filtration because the air that comes out is cleaner than the air in most homes. The bagless design lets you empty the bin with just one button press which ejects dirt without you having to touch it.</p>
<p>The lithium-ion battery keeps the suction strong as it drains, unlike older nickel-based batteries which lose power slowly over time. The docking station that hangs on the wall charges the vacuum and keeps the tools that come with it close at hand so everything is organized and ready for quick cleanups. And it <strong>takes about 4.5 hours to charge from empty to full</strong>&nbsp;and you can still take the battery out if you want to buy a spare for long cleaning sessions.</p>
<p>Instead of paying $629 for the V11 Origin, you can get it for $399 and it saves you $230 on a vacuum that usually stays at a high price because it is Dyson’s best-selling model between entry-level and flagship levels. This is your last chance to get premium Dyson performance before stock runs out and prices go back up.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Anker has been breaking its own records with portable charging solutions lately, and we’re here for it. If you rely on multiple devices to get through your day, like your smartphone, smartwatch, and earbuds, you need something that can top all three up without the usual cord clutter. The Anker 3-in-1 MagGo UFO charger for iOS does exactly that, and today is a great time to pick one up without paying the full price.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6106/">On a regular day, you’d expect to pay around $90 for it, but thanks to Cyber Monday, this all-in-one charging solution just dropped to $57, after a nice 36% discount.</a> All color options are discounted, but the prices vary. For instance, the black and pink versions are sitting at $57, while the white is going for $56, $1 less. The Teal version, on the other hand, is up for grabs at $59. All the offers are open to all shoppers, meaning you can score the discount whether you’re a Prime member or not.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6106/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>The Size of a Baseball</h2>
<p>When folded, this charger is the size of a baseball and resembles a macaron in looks. It’s much more compact than traditional adapters, meaning you can just slip it into your pocket and get going. Sturdiness comes from the built-in silicone strap, while the skin-friendly texture makes it comfortable to take it with you on the go. When opened, it offers three charging stations for three of your essentials; iPhone, Apple Watch, and AirPods.</p>
<p>Just drop each on its respective station, and it’s going to top them up in no time. Even better, you don’t always have to lay the whole thing open to use it. Support for Standby mode lets you keep the charger folded and still use your phone in landscape, which is perfect for when you want to stream a show, set a timer, display a calendar, or take a quick video call while it’s being powered.</p>



<p>The 15W capacity isn’t massive, but it’s enough to power your devices without much waiting. It can get an iPhone 15 Pro to 20% in 15 minutes and an Apple Watch Series 9 to 30% in 22 minutes. As for the compatibility, the charger plays nicely with iPhone Series 12 through 17 (except iPhone SE), Apple Watch Series 11/10/9/8/7 Ultra, plus Apple Watch Series 1-6, AirPods 2/3/4, and AirPods Pro 2, as well as the latest Pro 3.</p>
<p>Safety is taken just as seriously. ActiveShield 2.0 monitors temperature over 3,000,000 times per day to prevent overheating. The box comes with the wireless charging station, a 40W adapter, a 5 ft (1.5 m) USB-C to USB-C cable, a welcome guide, and a 24-month warranty for some extra peace of mind.</p>
<p>This early Cyber Monday deal lets you save an impressive $33 on a compact, all-in-one charging solution that’s both efficient and portable. You can use it on your trips if you like travelling light, or even at home to reduce the typical cord clutter. In fact, it can also make a great gift for a tech enthusiast in your life! There are multiple color options to choose from, which makes it easy to pick the ones that suit your aesthetics the best. Looking for something basic? Go for the black version. Want something with a bit more personality? The pink and teal versions look stunning. Again, you might want to act fast to grab the deal, and it won’t be around for long.</p>

              <p>Can’t start your day without a warm (or cold) cup of joe first thing in the morning? You need a good coffee machine at home, because those instant options aren’t the most flavorful, and heading out to your local cafe in your pajamas isn’t very ideal. Yes, coffee machines can cost a pretty penny, but that’s what sales like Black Friday and Cyber Monday are for. Even though the event is over, there are still plenty of deals to be had across a wide range of categories, including kitchen.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5371/">One of our favorites? This 29% discount on the highly-rated Breville Barista Express espresso machine, which brings the price down to $500</a>.

<h2>Rich Flavors Every Time, Without Stepping Out of Your Home</h2>
<p>Breville Barista Express uses a four-key formula to give you the results you want, including precision puck, extraction pressure, extraction temperature, and microfoam bubbles. It is part of the Barista Series that offers all-in-one espresso machines with an integrated grinder that lets you choose between 16 precision grind settings. These convert beans into espresso within seconds, extracting all the goodness hidden in there.</p>
<p>The thermocoil heating system controls water pressure, while the steam wands turn milk into smooth microfoam with a silky texture for you to get creative with latte art. To extract all that rich flavor and aroma, the coffee machine starts with a low-pressure infusion and then ramps it up gradually. The result? A well-balanced, rich cup that feels straight out of your favorite coffee shop.</p>



<p>All the controls are right there on the machine, and they’re pretty easy to follow. You can pick a grind amount, a filter size, a program, and the number of cups you’re hoping to fill. Your purchase will also come with 2 free bags of specialty coffee, which makes it easy to get started without paying anything extra. Other accessories include a razor-dose trimming tool, a 54mm stainless steel portafilter, 1 &amp; 2 cup single and dual wall filter baskets, coffee scoop, integrated tamper, stainless steel milk jug, cleaning disc, tablets, brush tool, allen key, water filter, and a filter holder. There’s also a 1-year limited warranty included for some peace of mind, just in case something goes wrong.</p>
<p>All in all, if you’ve been looking for a convenient way of making professional-level coffee at home, this deal offers a great chance to grab one of the best coffee machines out there for less. It may look intimidating at first, but getting started is straightforward and shouldn’t take more than a couple of tries to perfect your coffee recipe. Pair the machine with some syrups, and you can have an entire coffee menu of your own. Make some cool Spanish latte, try out pumpkin spice, or go for roasted hazelnut; the possibilities and combinations are endless.<a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5371/"> Don’t miss out on this chance to save $200 on the Breville Barista Express espresso machine, but this appliance rarely sees any drops, despite being so high in demand all year-round.</a></p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/apple-makes-a-zero-profit-move-as-airpods-pro-3-hits-an-all-time-low-close-to-pro-2-discount-pricing-2000648773</link>
            <guid>1368529</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p data-start="0" data-end="290">Apple introduced the highly anticipated AirPods Pro 3 just a couple short months ago, and just in time for the holidays, <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4214/">these popular earbuds are already seeing a discount thanks to Cyber Monday.</a> The earbuds launched with a price tag of $249, but this week you can scoop them up for 12% off. That ends up saving you $29, with the price coming down to just $220. So if you’re searching for a standout gift or just treating yourself to an upgrade, now is the perfect opportunity to grab a pair.</p>
<p data-start="292" data-end="812">So, what’s new about the AirPods Pro 3? The AirPods Pro 3 now feature an improved real-time noise canceling, removing up to twice the noise as the previous generation was capable of.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4214/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<p data-start="814" data-end="1252">The battery life has also been improved. You can now enjoy up to 10 hours of listening time (eight hours with active noise cancellation enabled) on a single charge—ideal for long flights or long days at the office. The charging case retains its MagSafe compatibility and now includes a built-in speaker, which helps you locate it using Apple’s “Find My” feature. If your case slips between couch cushions or gets lost in your bag, the speaker will ping, making it easier to track down.</p>
<p data-start="1254" data-end="1617">Apple has also upgraded the fit of the AirPods Pro 3. The updated design allows for better in-ear stability during physically demanding activities such as running, HIIT, yoga, and more. The earbuds now come with new foam-infused ear tips in five different sizes. This is includes a new XXS size to better fit ears of all shapes and sizes.</p>
<p data-start="1254" data-end="1617">Another welcome change is the switch from Lightning to USB-C for charging. This aligns the AirPods Pro 3 with Apple’s 2025 product lineup and simplifies the charging process for users with other USB-C devices. Of course, the case still supports Qi wireless charging, so if you already have wireless charging pads at home, you can continue using them without any issues.</p>


<h2 data-start="1254" data-end="1617">Smart Features</h2>
<p>The features of other Apple products seem to be leaking their way across product lines. Much like an Apple Watch,<a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4214/"> the AirPods Pro 3</a> are now capable of heart rate sensing. Track your heart rate and calories burned for up to 50 different workouts. You can access the data tracked via your iPhone.</p>
<p data-start="1619" data-end="1988">The AirPods Pro 3 now support live translation. With the help of Apple Intelligence, you can communicate with someone across languages — having your AirPods translate to your native tongue in real-time, right in your ear. Ever read <em>The Hitchhiker’s Guide to the Galaxy</em>. We now have real-world babel fish.</p>
<p data-start="2499" data-end="2884">While the AirPods Pro 3 aren’t exactly a budget buy, they are the most refined version of Apple’s flagship earbuds to date. You get enhanced sound quality, noise cancellation, and thoughtful design improvements. If you’ve been considering a pair, now’s the time to take advantage of the discount before the holiday rush. Own them for just $220 for a limited time.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/amazon-sells-15-6-portable-monitor-for-peanuts-fhd-screen-works-with-switch-and-laptop-2000648886</link>
            <guid>1368520</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><p>
                  Extend your workspace or game on a 15.6-inch Full HD IPS display anywhere.
                </p><div>
              
              <p>Small screens on laptops or handheld consoles (like the Switch) are fine for most things but they can be hard to see when you’re trying to find enemies in competitive games or edit spreadsheets with small text that hurts your eyes. A portable monitor fixes this by giving you a full-sized screen wherever you need one.</p>
<p>The<em> Arzopa A1</em> has a <strong>15.6-inch Full HD screen and can connect to almost anything with USB-C or HDMI</strong> which makes it great for gaming, working or streaming. For Cyber Monday, <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5746/">Amazon drops the price of this portable monitor from its usual $104 to $63</a> and this is the lowest price ever which it almost too cheap to pass up to buy a second screen.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5746/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>



<h2>IPS Panel Quality in a Package That’s Easy to Take on Trips</h2>
<p>This monitor has a 15.6-inch IPS panel with a resolution of 1920×1080 and the text is clear and the colors are bright which makes spreadsheets and games look sharp. The<strong> IPS technology lets you see the screen from 178 degrees both horizontally and vertically</strong> so the picture stays the same even when you look at it from the side or from above. This is important when you’re sharing the screen with someone next to you or when you have to put the monitor at an angle because of lack of desk space.</p>



<p>The <strong>60Hz refresh rate</strong> works well for regular gaming and work tasks, but competitive gamers might notice a difference when playing fast-paced shooters on 120Hz or 144Hz monitors. <strong>Response time is about 5ms</strong> which is fine for casual games, RPGs and strategy games where clear visuals are more important than quick reactions. The 16:9 aspect ratio works with most laptop screens and gaming consoles so there are no black bars when you mirror displays or make your workspace bigger.</p>
<p>The <strong>built-in kickstand folds out from the metal back panel</strong> and locks into different positions which means you can use it on desks, tables or even your lap without needing a separate stand. This design saves space when you travel and gets rid of extra accessories you would have to pack. The m<strong>onitor is only 1.6 pounds and 0.35 inches thick at its thinnest point</strong> so it fits easily into laptop bags or backpacks with your other gear.</p>



<p><strong>USB-C ports</strong> that can handle both video and power from compatible laptops are part of the connectivity which means that everything can be connected with just one cable, so you don’t need a separate power adapter. The <strong>mini-HDMI port</strong> can take signals from gaming consoles, desktop computers, cameras, or any other device with an HDMI output. If your laptop can’t provide enough power, the monitor can get power from a separate USB-C power adapter or through USB-C from your laptop.</p>
<p>The package comes with the monitor,<strong> a USB-C to USB-C cable, a USB-C to USB-A cable, a mini-HDMI to HDMI cable, and a case that protects the monitor</strong> and acts as a screen cover while it’s being moved. It only takes a few seconds to set up because all you have to do is plug in the right cable and the display turns on by itself.</p>
<p>If you buy this portable monitor for $63 instead of $104, you’ll get a price that beats most basic external displays while still keeping Full HD resolution and IPS quality. For less than the cost of budget monitors that don’t have portability features, you get a real portable second screen with a built-in stand, multiple ways to connect, and compatibility with a wide range of devices.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><p>
                  Enjoy 3D, room-filling audio for all your favorite content.
                </p><div>
              
              <p>Cyber Monday deals are rolling in. Most of these are Black Friday discounts being carried into the weekend, so if you missed grabbing something during the sale, there’s still a chance to bag it for less.</p>
<p>While several retailers are offering plenty of discounts, Amazon is being the most generous right now. It’s offering up to 50% off its own devices, taking hundreds off security cameras, smart displays, streaming sticks, Kindles, and more. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4053/">Those looking to give their entertainment setup an upgrade this holiday season should consider nabbing the latest Fire TV Soundbar Plus while it’s going at a 40% discount</a>. This brings the price down to just $150. You’re saving a massive $100 on an audio solution that’s going to make it easy to hear dialogues clearly, plus enjoy your favorite tunes to the fullest. Even better, both Prime and non-Prime members will enjoy free delivery on their purchase, which adds even more value to the offer.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4053/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>



<h2>Multiple Audio Modes</h2>
<p>Design-wise, it’s pretty similar to the older Fire TV soundbars. It sits nicely on your TV console without drawing too much attention to itself, and can even be mounted on a wall for a clean, tidy setup. But despite the compact frame, it does not compromise on the sound. Three full-range speakers, three tweeters, and two woofers push audio in all directions. Pair that with Dolby Atmos and DTS:X, and you’ll enjoy a 3D, room-filling experience that pulls you in, making you feel like you’re a part of whatever is playing on the screen. Sound mimics real life; the Battle of Pelennor Fields from The Lord of the Rings plays out as if it’s happening right in your living room. Watching a scary movie? Footsteps and whispers are going to feel like they’re coming from behind, making the whole thing even spookier.</p>
<p>The Dialogue Enhancer works overtime to keep the conversations sharp by actively pushing voices above background sounds, even with low volume. You won’t have to constantly rewind just to hear what was said. You can also choose between multiple audio modes that optimize the sound based on what’s playing. These include Movie, Music, Sports, and Night modes. The night mode for instance, delivers balanced audio that won’t wake the entire home up, while the music mode gives bass a boost. Speaking of music, you can even use the soundbar as a speaker by connecting it to your smartphone or tablet via Bluetooth and streaming your favorite tracks.</p>



<p>Setting everything up and getting started couldn’t be simpler. Plug your soundbar’s HDMI cable into your TV’s eARC/ARC port, and power the TV on with your remote. The audio will instantly change from your TV to the soundbar; simple as that. As for the compatibility, it plays nicely with just about any smart TV, plus the screens connected to streaming media players.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4053/">There’s a lot more to like about this soundbar, especially now that it’s going at a $100 discount.</a> This deal lets you grab it for just $150, which is basically nothing for all that it’s packed with. It’s an early Cyber Monday deal, but keeping past trends in mind, we’re expecting it to expire soon. If you’ve been after a reliable audio solution, today is the day to make the move. You’re also going to enjoy free delivery if you place your orders before Dec. 4.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><p>
                  Upgrade your existing rig or build a new one with a new 6GB, HDMI 2.1 &amp; DisplayPort 1.4a graphics card for a fraction of the price of a new gaming PC.
                </p><div>
              
              <p>PC gamers and computer DIYers alike are going to love this Cyber Monday deal at Amazon after Black Friday — <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6105/">the ASUS Dual GeForce RTX 3050 is a gaming graphics card that’s capable of upgrading an older gaming rig or being the visual nerve center of a self-built one, and it’s just $160 after a 20% off deal</a>. That’s a great price for a major upgrade on an older computer, and definitely a more economical choice than buying an entirely new machine.</p>
<p>The RTX 3050 is compatible with PC towers, not laptops. It connects to the PC’s motherboard to drive the computer’s graphic performance. It’s an exceptional mid-range gaming graphics card with 6GB of GDDR6 VRAM, PCIe 4.0 support, HDMI 2.1 and DisplayPort 1.4a ports, and a compact dual-slot build that allows it to also fit into the more-slender desktop PCs. It’s power- and heat efficient so you don’t need the large tower or big cooling setup to prevent it from overheating.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6105/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>



<h2>Reliable HD Gaming</h2>
<p>Installation of the RTX 3050 could not be easier — open the tower, find the motherboard, and either add the card in an empty graphics slot or replace the existing one. Once up and running, your PC will be fully capable of 1080p gaming, which is great for shooters, indie games, and eSports games thanks to the high frame rate and stable performance. It’s not a 4K gaming machine, but it’s plenty of HD power for an exceptional price.</p>
<p>The HDMI 2.1 hookup and fast refresh rate give you the further option of hooking up your upgraded PC to a faster monitor or TV. And as a new card, the firmware updates and the driver support will be better. Since every piece of a tech setup has a finite life before it reaches obsolescence — the point where the manufacturer no longer provides updates or support, and games are no longer compatible — a brand-new graphics card will push that deadline further down the road, thus extending the lifespan of your entire PC for a small price.</p>



<h2>Upgrade or Build</h2>
<p>Swapping out a graphics card to upgrade and extend the life of a PC is rewarding, but building one either from scratch or from the bones of an old dead tower is&nbsp;<em>fun</em>. But the cost does add up when you’re shopping for all of the components — motherboard, internal storage, RAM, and five or six things you didn’t know you needed until you tried to boot up. An inexpensive graphics card is a key component of a DIY build or rebuild, and the performance you get from the GeForce RTX 3050 for its original $200 price earned it an average 4.6-star rating from Amazon reviewers. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6105/">Now with this Cyber Monday deal that drops 20% off the price, the RTX 3050 vastly overperforms on its new $160 price</a>. Hit Amazon now before this Cyber Monday gamer deal ends.</p>

                  The best value for money VR headset if you own a PS5.
                </p><div>
              
              <p>Black Friday is over but Cyber Monday keeps the excitement going by lowering prices even more on gaming hardware at Amazon. The <strong>PlayStation VR2</strong> is a next-level virtual reality headset that feels completely different from smartphone VR headsets and if you have a PS5 and want to get deeper into immersive gaming, this is the headset for you.</p>
<p>Right now, <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5779/">this bundle is only $299, down from the usual $399 and it comes with Horizon Call of the Mountain</a>, so you can start playing a full AAA VR adventure as soon as you open it. This bundle is at its lowest price ever on Amazon for Cyber Monday.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5779/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>



<h2>OLED Screens and Eye Tracking</h2>
<p>The <strong>PSVR2 has two OLED panels that give each eye a resolution of 2000×2040</strong>&nbsp;which is 4K total resolution. This gets rid of the screen-door effect that older VR headsets had, where you could see individual pixels. The <strong>110-degree field of view</strong> gives you peripheral vision that is similar to real life, so virtual environments feel truly big instead of like you’re looking through binoculars. With <strong>HDR support</strong>, deep blacks and bright highlights stand out and gives images more depth. The 90Hz or 120Hz refresh rate options make fast gameplay smooth which helps with motion sickness and makes head movements feel natural instead of laggy.</p>



<p>The <strong>PSVR2’s best feature is eye tracking</strong> which lets the headset see where you’re looking and use that information in many different ways. Foveated rendering uses the graphics processing power to focus on what you’re looking at directly and lower the detail in your peripheral vision, and it makes things run faster without you noticing any quality loss. Some games use eye tracking to help you aim in shooters, make eye contact with NPCs in story-driven games, or start events based on where your gaze stays.</p>
<p>When there are explosions, impacts, or weather effects like rain, <strong>haptic feedback vibrates through the headset itself</strong> and adds a physical element that regular VR doesn’t have. The <strong>adaptive triggers on the included Sense controllers push back against your finger pressure</strong> in a way that makes drawing a bowstring feel tense or pulling the trigger on a gun feel real. Inside-out tracking uses four cameras built into the headset to keep an eye on the controllers and your play area and you don’t need any sensors mounted around your room.</p>



<p><em>Horizon Call of the Mountain</em> shows off what PSVR2 can do with a VR adventure set in the Horizon universe: It has climbing mechanics that use hand-over-hand motion, archery that requires real aiming and drawing and beautiful views that show off the graphics quality. The game was made specifically for VR instead of being a port of a flat-screen game which means that every interaction uses the headset’s eye tracking and haptic features.</p>
<p>For $299 instead of $399, you can get the PSVR2 with Horizon Call of the Mountain which makes high-end VR available at a price that used to only get you entry-level standalone headsets. For $100 less, you get Sony’s best VR technology, including eye tracking, haptic feedback, and 4K OLED visuals – plus, you get a full AAA game that would cost $60 on its own.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Forget Nintendo, Sony Goes No-Margin on the PlayStation Portal Remote Player as It Hits an All-Time Low After Black Friday]]></title>

                  Save 11% on the PlayStation Portal Remote Player over at Amazon this holiday season.
                </p><div>
              
              <p>Handheld gaming consoles have come through in a big way this past decade. The Nintendo Switch paved the way for the other big players in the gaming space to rethink what it means to be able to game while on the go. We’ve since seen the advent of the Steam Deck—Valve’s PC gaming handheld—along with some other third parties throwing their hats in the race with the Asus ROG Ally and the Lenovo Legion Go. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6104/">PlayStation has its own take on the format with the PlayStation Portal Remote Player for PS5. Amazon happens to have it discounted for Black Friday and Cyber Monday.</a> The 11% savings equates to the handheld system dropping from $200 to just $179 for a limited time. You end up saving $21.</p>
<p>On the surface, the PlayStation Portal Remote Player looks like if you hacked up a PS5 DualSense controller and stuck the pieces to the side of your Nintendo Switch. That’s not a bad thing. The PS5 controller is comfortable to use, and having the handheld mimic it almost exactly allows for a more seamless experience when playing games between your PlayStation 5 console and your PlayStation Portal Remote Player. The handheld is capable of playing games at up to 60fps, displaying in a resolution of 1080p. Choose between either the white version or the midnight black model.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6104/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>



<p>Where the PlayStation Portal Remote Player differs from the other gaming handhelds is its not a standalone unit. The Portal doe not let you play games directly on the unit itself. the games you play are either streamed from the cloud or streamed from your home PlayStation 5 console. So in that sense, it’s more akin to the Wii U gamepad as opposed to the Nintendo Switch.</p>
<p>Remote Play let’s you play compatible games you have installed on your PS5 console, be they PlayStation 5 games or PlayStation 4 games. This makes the PlayStation Portal Remote Player a great accessory for families who share the TV room. Are you a dad, trying to catch up on&nbsp;<em>The Last of Us: Part II: Remastered</em> before the new HBO season comes back? You can sit and enjoy the game on your PlayStation Portal Remote Player with some headphones while your kid enjoys Ms. Rachel on the TV.</p>



<h2>Better With PlayStation Plus</h2>
<p>With PlayStation Plus, you gain access to an expansive catalogue of digital games—a good chunk of which are Cloud Streaming compatible.</p>
<p>The Game Catalogue is filled with newly released titles that you will have access to play with a monthly subscription. It’s Netflix applied to video games. Dive into games like&nbsp;<em>Ghost of Tsushima</em> and&nbsp;<em>God of War: Ragnarök</em>. You also gain access to the Classics Catalogue where you can explore all the PlayStation games of yesteryear. You can play through the entire original God of War trilogy before stepping into the two latest games that came with 2016’s soft-reboot of the series.</p>
