              <p>Why are the stocking stuffers always the last thing on everybody’s holiday list? Small gifts can be the best ones, especially when they’re amazingly useful and at near-all-time low prices,<a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3844/"> like this 4-pack of Apple AirTags that’s on sale at Amazon for 34% off and will still arrive in time for Christmas if you order now.</a></p>
<p>Being stocking-sized is only a small part of the appeal for this deal. Normally a $99 buy, a 4-pack of AirTags for just $65 is a major score, and if you’re a devoted Apple fan or even just an iPhone user, the AirTags are by far the best Bluetooth trackers. They’re compact, exceptionally easy to set up, are powered by an easy-to-find replaceable battery, and help you find lost items with amazing precision.</p>

<h2>4-Pack Covers It All</h2>
<p>One 4-pack of Apple AirTags can cover a huge swath of the items you need to keep tabs on. There is a huge range of inexpensive AirTag holders that fit keychains, along with holders for wallets and even wallets and money clips that have built-in AirTag holders. Backpacks and other bags are even easier — just drop in an AirTag and let it do the work for you. With your iPhone or iPad handy, you’ll have a location on your valuables at all times.</p>
<p>AirTags have become indispensable travel accessories too. Most major airlines have some form of luggage tracking app or service, but to be&nbsp;<em>really</em> sure of where your bags are, an AirTag slipped into an inner compartment is the best method. Distance is no issue, since the AirTags connect to Apple’s massive Find My network, which is able to ping off of nearby Apple devices — without compromising your privacy or safety — to locate your item whether it’s tens or thousands of miles away.</p>
<p>Finding far closer objects — the wallet or keys that slid between couch cushions or slipped under a car seat — is fast and easy with the Find My app. The app gives you directions and distances down to the inch, and you can also make the AirTag play a chime to help you narrow down the search.</p>



<h2>Tough Little Tracker</h2>
<p>The AirTag is IP67-rated for dust and water exposure, and the outer shell is tough enough to endure the knocks and drops that come with being attached to a keychain or the outside of a backpack. The battery is good for roughly a year, and the FindMy app on your iOS device will let you know when it’s time to get a fresh battery. When that time comes, the CR2032 disc battery is one of the most common and easy to find batteries, and the AirTag is easy to open. A quick few seconds later, your AirTag is ready to go for another year.</p>
<p>Not many people are going to put AirTags on their holiday gift list, but anyone who finds a 4-pack of these top-tier Bluetooth trackers in their stocking will be very pleasantly surprised. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3844/">The 4-pack of Apple AirTags on sale at Amazon for just $65 is a thoughful and exceptionally useful gift idea</a>, and if you order now they’ll still make it in time for Christmas.</p>

              <p>Building a desktop PC from scratch, or upgrading your CPU? We’ve found a deal that lets you pick a strong motherboard without overspending.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6545/">The Asus ROG Strix B550-F Gaming WiFi II – an option that offers exceptional power and great gaming features – is currently available for just $120 at Amazon, down from its usual $180 price.</a> This is one of the lowest we have seen this motherboard drop to, but as you’d expect, the offer wraps up soon. It’s best to get your orders in sooner rather than later, before that happens. Note that the package is likely going to arrive after Christmas. If you were planning to surprise a gamer or a creative in your life with it, keep the shipping timeline in mind.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6545/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Feature-Rich</h2>
<p>This motherboard is an excellent option for AMD Ryzen 3000 and 5000 series, as well as 5000 and 4000 G-series desktop processors. The thoughtful 14-phase VRM design (12 main and 2 auxiliary) lets it handle the powerful options well without overheating, making it great for anyone looking to work with resource-intensive programs and heavier projects frequently. It supports Windows 11, plus allows for up to 128GB of RAM, which is more than enough to handle serious multitasking.</p>
<p>Build quality is just as exceptional, with RGB lighting adding a nice aesthetic touch to the setup. The feature-rich board is also PCIe 4.0-ready, which translates into faster data transfer speeds, especially when paired with a high-end NVMe SSD. You will be able to load games, launch apps, and move files (even the larger ones) around without waiting long. What’s more, WiFi 6E (802.11ax) and Intel 2.5 Gb Ethernet with ASUS LANGuard come together to ensure smooth networking. On the other hand, ports like dual M.2 slots, USB 3.2 Gen 2 Type-C, plus HDMI 2.1 and DisplayPort 1.2 outputs make it convenient to connect other devices for a fuller, more productive setup.</p>



<p>The box includes the motherboard itself, an ASUS 2×2 dual Wi-Fi antenna, an addressable RGB extension cable, a user manual, a support CD, and an ROG sticker pack. The bundle also includes a 60-day subscription to AIDA64 Extreme.</p>
<p>All things considered, if you’ve been looking for a solid motherboard to add to your setup without breaking the bank, the Asus ROG Strix B550-F Gaming WiFi II is one of the best options to consider. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6545/">We’d highly recommend it at its full $180 price, but the current 33% discount makes it much more affordable and, honestly, a no-brainer.</a> The $120 asking is nothing compared to all the features it’s packed with. Just be sure to snap it up quickly, because the deal is selling out fast. Place your orders before it expires, or before the stock runs out for good.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[DJI Clears Out Microphone Bundle Beyond Drones, Mic 3 (2 TX + 1 RX + Charging Case) Hits an All-Time Low]]></title>
            <link>https://kotaku.com/dji-clears-out-microphone-bundle-beyond-drones-mic-3-2-tx-1-rx-charging-case-hits-an-all-time-low-2000654885</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>If you want to be recognized as a serious creator, it is essential to give your audio the attention it deserves. Whether you’re conducting street interviews or recording reaction videos for platforms like TikTok, your audience will notice the sound quality. Even if it’s on a subconscious level, poor audio can make your content feel low-budget. In fact, I’d argue that audio quality is even more important than video quality in some cases, even though it might sound counterintuitive. Investing in a high-quality wireless lavalier microphone setup can drastically improve the sound in your videos. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6544/">A great option to consider is the DJI Mic 3 kit, which is currently 21% off, bringing the price down from $329 to $259—an impressive $70 discount.</a></p>
<p>The DJI Mic 3 kit includes two transmitters, a wireless receiver, and a charging case. All the components come pre-linked, so they’re ready to use right out of the box. The system is also compatible with USB-C and Lightning adapters, which are included in the package, giving you more connectivity options for various devices. You can clip the transmitter to your shirt, your hat, I suppose just hold it between your fingers which is now becoming the norm on TikTok and Instagram.</p>

<h2>Intelligent Noise Cancellation</h2>
<p>These microphones support intelligent noise-canceling, allowing the them to capture clear vocals in detailed 32-bit audio while minimizing unwanted background noise. These mics can handle unpredictable environments like busy streets or crowded convention halls. Plus, the kit comes with two windscreens to further reduce the interference of wind noises when you’re filming outdoors.</p>
<p>The DJI Mic 3 system provides an impressive wireless range of over 1,300 feet, giving you greater freedom to shoot in various locations without worrying about losing signal. This extended range allows you to move around with more flexibility.</p>



<p>Battery life is another major selling point. Both the transmitters and the receiver can operate for up to 28 hours, ensuring you’ll have plenty of power for extended shoots. The included charging case acts as a portable power bank, capable of recharging the mics when you’re on the go. If you’re only using one transmitter at a time, you can keep the second one in the case and swap it in when the first one runs low on battery. The case is compact, fitting all the components neatly together, making it easy to pack up when you’re done filming.</p>
<p>If you’re ready to upgrade from your phone’s built-in microphone to a more professional setup, the DJI Mic 3 lavalier kit is a solid choice. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6544/">For just $259, you’ll get two transmitters, the receiver, a charging case, and other accessories—at a significant discount.</a> Don’t miss out on this opportunity to improve your audio and take your content creation to professional levels.</p>
