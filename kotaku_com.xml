Since it was officially unveiled in April, it’s sounded like a very exciting shake-up of the popular but stale <em>Mario Kart </em>formula. Instead of individual tracks that you race on separately via different events,<em> </em><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/mario-kart-world-nintendo-direct-switch-2-courses-modes-1851776553&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/mario-kart-world-nintendo-direct-switch-2-courses-modes-1851776553"><em>Mario Kart World </em>features an open map with no loading screens</a></span>. Each race track in this open-world playground is connected by roads and highways. Events are spread across the open map, which you can explore between races to find collectibles, missions, and more. And the map all of this takes place in sounds large. Very large. </p><p><em>Game File’</em>s Stephen Totilo got his hands on the Switch 2 early via an official press event.

So don’t take this as scientific proof tha<em>t Mario Kart World</em> is in fact bigger than <em>Forza Horizon 5 or GTA 5.</em>&nbsp;</p><p>Instead, to me this just implies that, yes, the open world in Nintendo’s upcoming kart racer is big. It’s not a tiny little open world that you’ll explore in a few minutes, but something that, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.polygon.com/nintendo-switch-2/603046/mario-kart-world-impressions-gameplay-hands-on&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.polygon.com/nintendo-switch-2/603046/mario-kart-world-impressions-gameplay-hands-on" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">according to a preview from <em>Polygon</em></a></span>, is filled with hundreds of collectibles, missions, and side activities. </p><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.ign.com/articles/mario-kart-worlds-open-world-isnt-what-you-think-it-is&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/mario-kart-worlds-open-world-isnt-what-you-think-it-is" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Though, according to <em>IGN, </em>the open-world mode</a></span> in the game doesn’t feel nearly as exciting or content-packed as that of <em>Horizon 5</em>. This is still a Nintendo-developed <em>Mario Kart</em> game and not some highly detailed simulation of a real world filled with multiple progression bars and seasons, like <em>Forza </em>or <em>The Crew</em>. Still, I’m very excited to get lost for hours exploring <em>Mario Kart World</em> when it arrives for Switch 2 on June 5. </p><p> .<br></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Following a big update for the new season, many angry players spotted ads for bundles and battle passes in never-before-seen places, like inside the loadout menu.

The loadout menu in <em>Call of Duty: Black Ops 6</em> and <em>Warzone </em>is likely the place in which players spend the most time when not actually shooting people in-game. And to suddenly see cosmetic and season pass ads shoved in here angered many. It seems the backlash was so intense that Activision stepped in to remove them all.</p><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://x.com/CODUpdates/status/1929672257217204291&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://x.com/CODUpdates/status/1929672257217204291" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">On June 2, the official <em>Call of Duty “</em>updates” account</a></span> run by Activision tweeted out a short message addressing the annoying ads, explaining that they were added to the games “in error.”  </p><p>“A UI feature test that surfaced select store content in the Loadout menus was published in the Season 04 update in error. This feature has now been removed from the live game,” said Activision.</p><p>Of course, many players didn’t buy this explanation, with some suggesting that Activision quietly added it in to see what the reaction would be, and when players went nuclear, backed off. Even if you take Activision’s word that it was mistakenly added, the fact that it was even testing the idea of adding more advertisements into more parts of<em> Call of Duty</em> means it was clearly being considered. And that’s concerning.</p><p>This is a franchise with some of the <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/call-of-duty-black-ops-cold-wars-menus-suck-1846458782&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/call-of-duty-black-ops-cold-wars-menus-suck-1846458782">worst, most ad-riddled and ugly menus in all of modern video games</a></span>. To shove even <em>more </em>ads into the few areas of <em>CoD</em> that are still useful and useable is gross, especially when you remember that <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.tweaktown.com/news/105098/call-of-duty-franchise-revenues-exceed-35-billion/index.html&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.tweaktown.com/news/105098/call-of-duty-franchise-revenues-exceed-35-billion/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Activision still charges $60+ for new<em> Call of Duty </em>games and sells an endless list of in-game cosmetics every day</a></span>. Did the company really need to test out more ways to squeeze in ads? I don’t think so, and based on how players reacted, I’m sure Activision will be careful about adding more advertisements in the near future. </p><p>.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
