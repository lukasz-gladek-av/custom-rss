              <p>I have too many devices that need charging at night. Between my iPhone, AirPods, and Apple Watch, there are enough cables circling around by night stand that it’s beginning to look like some sort of cyberpunk bird’s nest. Of course, this is my own fault. I can just get a charging stand such as this MagSafe one from Anker which will eliminate my electronic clutter entirely.<a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4245/"> It’s normally set at $111, but thanks to a 46% limited time discount, it’s now down to just $60. You save a whole $52 for the duration of the sale.</a></p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4245/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Designed for Apple</h2>
<p>This Anker MagSafe charging stand is built from the ground up for modern Apple products. Newer iPhones, AirPod cases, and Apple Watches all support wireless charging and this stand has three wireless chargers built in. Each are specifically made for either phone charging, watch charging, or earbud case charging.</p>
<p>Be sure to check which model iPhone and AirPods you have as earlier versions don’t support wireless charging. So long as you have an iPhone 12 or later model, you’ll be good to go on that front.</p>
<p>Charging is fast enough for what the stand is going for. It’s capable of 15W charging. You can find much faster charging options when going with something wired, even within the Anker family of products. However, this is really an end-of-the-day sort of charging stand. When you turn down for the night, and set up all your devices on it, they’ll be fully charged by morning, no problem. That said, it can still bring an Apple Watch Series 9 to nearly 50% in just 30 minutes.</p>



<p>While you have your iPhone charging on the stand, it can be set to display the charging status of the other devices you have charging as well as a clock display. Perfect for your night stand to catch the time at a glance, head still on your pillow.</p>
<p>Anker’s has a safety-first design philosophy on its products and we have the same story here on the MagSafe multi-device wireless charger. ActiveShield tech monitors temperatures over three million times per day to help ensure your phone and other devices don’t overheat.</p>
<p>There are two color options available. Choose either black or white. Do note that while both are on sale currently, the better deal is on the white version. Get it now for $51 off for a limited time. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4245/">That brings the price down from $111 to just $60. You can get the black for $71 at the moment.</a></p>

              <p>Anti-piracy measures, as a rule, suck. But when they’re funny, they get a pass. That appears to be the case for the Nintendo 64’s <em>Super Smash Bros.</em>, which as revealed by Supper Mario Broth (thanks&nbsp;<a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/super-smash-bros/if-you-play-a-pirated-super-smash-bros-exactly-69-times-on-n64-nintendos-sneaky-anti-piracy-measure-will-lull-the-illegitimate-user-into-a-false-sense-of-security-and-trap-you-as-mario-forever/"><em>GamesRadar</em></a>) will lock you in to being able to play only a single character, but only after you’ve played the game 69 times. Dude.</p> <p>I’m so adorably naive that I didn’t even realize pirating N64 games was an option back in the day. Of course, in 1996 when dial-up internet was a new-born baby, this wasn’t a case of downloading ROMs from the internet, but rather buying knock-off N64 cartridges from that dodgy-looking stall at the mall. As a rule, when the game’s name was written on the cartridge in Sharpie, or it featured a black-and-white version of the sticker but with the writing in German, it probably wasn’t wholly legit. And it seems that if that’s the version of&nbsp;<em>Super Smash Bros.</em> you bought in ’99, it was trapped.</p> <p>As Supper Mario Broth puts it, the anti-piracy measure here was “delayed action,” allowing the player to boot the game an enormous 68 times before anything would happen. Then, on the 69th time of playing, you’d suddenly find yourself locked in to only being able to play as Mario. Anything else would, the social media account reports, erase all your save data.</p>   <p>It truly is the most mild of punishments. If you loved that game enough to play it almost 70 times, you’d eventually be stuck, er, still able to play the game in two-player, and limited to one character for single-player matches.</p>

 <p>Funnily enough, Nintendo’s devilish trick here gets close to one of the very few actually effective anti-piracy measures to have been used: when a game lets you play it for so long before popping up a message saying, “Hey, you pirated this! We hope you enjoyed it so far, and if you want to carry on, buy a copy here.” Treating pirates as potential customers has proven lucrative for many indie projects over the years, while draconian systems based on hardware locks, disc requirements, and game-slowing software used by AAA publishers have only ever punished legitimate purchasers, all such restrictions inevitably removed from the pirated versions.</p> <p>And yes, it’s very unlikely Nintendo picked 69 for comedy reasons, but I still like to believe.</p>

              <p>Hideo Kojima’s&nbsp;<em>OD</em> finally has its first trailer, and yes, of course, it’s entirely cutscene, but oh my word, what a cutscene. You’ll oscillate between “Good grief, I can’t believe this is the Unreal Engine and not real life, and “Oh god, what the fuck is that?” throughout its three minutes.</p> <p>During Kojima Productions’ tenth anniversary celebrations, Hideo Kojima finally revealed some moving images of his forthcoming horror game&nbsp;<em>OD</em>, a project he’s co-creating with horror maestro Jordan Peele. What we get is an incredibly tense scene in which the perfectly rendered hands of Sophia Lillis (<em>It</em>,&nbsp;<em>I Am Not Okay With This</em>) attempt to light a whole mess of candles. It’s tense because of far too many sounds, from Lillis’s own terrified breathing, the ambient sounds of adjacent apartments, and that infernal knocking at the door.</p>  <p>By the end, whoever was knocking clearly ran out of patience and let themselves in. We see the sinister, shadowy figure over Lissis’s shoulder (and note the face-shaped scars all over her own face), its thudding footsteps unnervingly slow, as it whispers demonically. Then, in case you were wondering if everything was going to be OK, it grabs for her and she screams. After the titles we cut back to see vast, grey hands clutching Lissis’s face in a truly iconic image.</p>

 <p>Which is all lovely and scary! It, of course, tells us precisely nothing whatsoever about the game, other than that it’ll feature baby-shaped candles and be dreadfully frightening. There are so many horror elements taking place at once here, from the worms crawling out of a candle in writhing bundles to the awful image of the cartoonish baby-faced candle melting to reveal its wick, accompanied by the noises of a real baby screaming nearby. Oh, and the tall, awful demon-thing—I’m yet to be convinced he’s a goodie.</p> <p>At the live event, there was all sorts of empty bluster about how the game will change the very fabric of reality, perhaps requiring that humanity once again reset the yearly clock to a new&nbsp;<em>After OD</em> era, while not actually saying anything at all about what happens in the game. Microsoft’s Phil Spencer declared it “truly visionary” while Kojima, modest as ever, added “this is totally different, even as a system.” But best was Kojima’s declaration that as he travels all around the world scanning spooky locations for the photorealistic game, “I want to scan a ghost for the first time, and I want to get an award for that.” Good luck with that.</p> <p>Still, the trailer is freaking cool.</p>
