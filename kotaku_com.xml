              <p>Good morning! Happy Halloween! Yes, kids all around the nation get to enjoy one of life’s best treats: A Friday Halloween. Stay up late, kids, and eat so much candy. But before you wreck your teeth and stomachs, let’s get through today’s Morning Checkpoint, <em>Kotaku</em>‘s daily roundup of gaming news and culture. Today, we have evidence of a <em>Silent Hill 2</em> remake Xbox port, more layoff news, the reveal of pets in <em>Fortnite</em>, and some new ports of&nbsp;<em>Turok 2&nbsp;</em>arriving courtesy of Nightdive Studios.</p> <h2><strong><em>Fortnite</em> adds animal sidekicks</strong></h2> <figure id="attachment_2000640494" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000640494"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000640494">©Epic Games</figcaption></figure> <p>On Thursday, <a href="https://www.fortnite.com/news/introducing-fortnite-sidekicks?lang=en-US">Epic announced</a> that the long-rumored pets feature is finally arriving in <em>Fortnite</em> on November 1 alongside<em> The Simpsons</em> mini-season. These tiny buddies are officially known as “Sidekicks” and will follow you around in battle royale and other <em>Fortnite</em> modes. However, enemy players won’t see them in competitive modes, so your cute puppy doesn’t give away your position and get you killed. Sidekicks will also be immune to damage and will feature their own customization options that can be unlocked by completing quests. I can already hear Epic’s bank account filling with even more money.</p>

 <h2><strong>The <em>Silent Hill 2</em> remake is likely coming to Xbox in the near future</strong></h2> <p><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GamingLeaksAndRumours/comments/1okrnqd/silent_hill_2_has_been_rated_for_xbox_series_xs/">Folks have spotted</a> an ESRB rating for a yet-to-be-announced Xbox port of last year’s excellent <em>Silent Hill 2</em> remake. This doesn’t officially confirm such a port will happen, but it seems very, very likely that Konami is gearing up to bring the remake to Xbox Series X/S in not too distant future. At the moment, <em>Silent Hill 2</em> is only available on PS5 and PC.</p>

 <h2><strong><em>MGS3</em> remake’s multiplayer mode is now available</strong></h2>  <p>When Konami’s fancy remake of M<em>etal Gear Solid 3</em> launched back in August, the game’s promised multiplayer mode was missing as it needed more time in the oven. Now, <em>Fox Hunt</em> is finally out as part of a free update. At launch, <em>Fox Hunt</em> features two stealth-focused multiplayer modes and supports 12 players. While it ain’t a new version of <em>Metal Gear Online</em>, I’m certainly curious to check it out. I mean, once I find time to play it and the 20 other games I still need to play this year.</p> <h2><strong>More layoffs hit Heart Machine</strong></h2> <p>The studio behind <em>Hyper Light Drifter </em>and <em>Solar Ash</em> is reportedly laying off employees for the second time this month. <a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/report-possessor-s-dev-heart-machine-lays-off-more-staff-two-weeks-before-the-game-s-launch">As reported by <em>GameDeveloper.com</em>,</a> at least four different staff members have recently posted on social media that they were laid off. One now out-of-work dev shared a video suggesting that by the time the studio’s next game, <span data-testid="content-text"><span><em>Possessor(s)</em>, launches on November 11, most, if not all, of the people who worked on it might be gone from the indie studio. This is the second round of layoffs to hit the company this month and the third round in early 2025.&nbsp;</span></span></p> <h2>ICYMI:</h2> <ul> <li><a href="https://kotaku.com/arc-raiders-battlefield-6-skins-silly-cosmetics-crossover-black-ops-7-steam-2000640251"><em>Arc Raiders</em> will avoid silly, immersion-breaking skins</a></li> <li><a href="https://kotaku.com/halloween-candy-price-inflation-trump-tariff-snap-2000640156">Candy prices are going up thanks to President Trump</a></li> <li><a href="https://kotaku.com/escape-simulator-2-room-interview-pine-studio-2000639908">A wonderful interview with the devs behind <em>Escape Sim 2</em></a></li> </ul> <h2>Watch This:</h2>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>South Korean game studio Shift Up recently posted a developer interview video to celebrate the third anniversary of its RPG <em>Goddess of Victory: NIK</em>KE. And as reported by <em><a href="https://automaton-media.com/en/news/shift-up-says-it-doesnt-tolerate-any-expressions-of-hate-in-nikke-following-backlash-over-alleged-small-genital-gesture/">Automation Media</a></em> and <em><a href="https://www.thisisgame.com/articles/405545">ThisIsGame,</a> </em>during this video, the studio’s director Hyungsuk Yoo took a hard stance against “<a href="https://youtu.be/dYEX1ND8HrI?t=1864">hateful expressions</a>” in the popular RPG, saying: “We will never tolerate anyone intentionally inserting hate speech into <em>NIKKE</em> or approaching the game with that mindset.”</p> <p>However, the devs don’t directly mention what this is in reference to in the video; it’s very likely an attempt to address a controversial situation involving a piece of art created for <em>NIKKE</em> and an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finger_pinching_conspiracy_theory">odd conspiracy online involving a pinched hand gesture</a> that many men in South Korea believe mocks men with small penises.</p>

 <p>In August, to celebrate the game’s 1,000th day in operation, <a href="https://automaton-media.com/en/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/20251030-53477-001.jpg">a piece of artwork was released.</a> Some South Korean men online alleged that two characters in the artwork were covertly flashing the pinched fingers gesture. <a href="https://game.naver.com/lounge/nikke/board/detail/6464533">Shift Up quickly apologized</a>, edited the image <a href="https://automaton-media.com/en/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/20251030-53477-002.jpg">to remove the gestures</a>, and blamed the whole incident on an overseas team responsible for the art. But that hasn’t stopped many online players from continuing to harass the devs and leave angry comments. So the recent commitment against “hateful expressions” is seen by many as the studio’s latest attempt to calm things down.</p> <p>It’s unlikely this will work, though, as the “Crab Hand” gesture has become a widely embraced conspiracy theory among many men in South Korea who believe it to be connected to a feminist movement in the country that some believe went too far. As a result of this situation, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finger_pinching_conspiracy_theory#List_of_notable_responses">many, many companies have faced backlash</a> for artwork or ads that seem to include “crab hands,” even when it seems obvious that the art wasn’t intended to mock anyone or the hands are only vaguely pinched.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/game-awards-2025-goty-race-polymarket-clair-obscur-2000640468</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/betting-markets-have-decided-silksong-doesn%E2%80%99t-have-a-chance-in-hell-of-winning-game-of-the-year.1340446/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Polymarket has opened up betting on The Game Awards 2025 and no one seems to have a doubt that <a href="https://kotaku.com/clair-obscur-expedition-33-rpg-review-in-progress-1851777402"><em>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</em></a> will take top honors at Geoff Keighley’s showcase. The odds are so stacked in the French RPG’s favor that a $100 bet on <em>Hollow Knight: Silksong</em> would net you over $1,000 if it actually ended up winning game of the year instead.</p> <p>Gambling on the 2025 GOTY race opened up on <a href="https://polymarket.com/event/game-awards-game-of-the-year-2025">Polymarket</a> on October 29, well in advance of anyone actually voting on what game will actually win has even begun. The Best Game category is decided by media ballots (90 percent) and fan voting (10 percent) with the winner revealed during the <a href="https://kotaku.com/game-awards-keighley-e3-trailers-1851083267">live show on December 11</a>.</p>

 <p>Nominees are chosen in November followed by a final round of voting. While it’s Keighley’s show, he doesn’t participate in any part of the selection process. Also, full disclosure, <em>Kotaku</em> has never participated in voting and nothing in this article should be mistaken for financial advice (that’s a thing you’re supposed to write, right?)</p>

 <p>With all of those wrinkles in mind, the first 48 hours of the <a href="https://kotaku.com/game-awards-goty-game-of-the-year-past-winners-list-1851721067">GOTY race</a> on Polymarket were interesting to witness. While<em> Clair Obscur</em> is currently leading with bets suggesting an 80 percent chance of winning, it didn’t start out that way. It was actually<em> Silksong</em> who was the frontrunner in the initial hour after the market opened. Whoever was betting first must have been all in on the Metroidvania hype.</p>

 <figure id="attachment_2000640482" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000640482"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000640482">Polymarket / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p>But it didn’t take long for the pack of frontrunners, which also included <em>Death Stranding 2</em> and <em>Hades 2</em>, to fall way behind Sandfall Interactive’s surprise turn-based hit. All of those other games are not currently trending in the single-digits. <em>Silksong</em> is second with 8 percent, <em>Hades 2</em> is third with 5 percent, and <em>Death Stranding</em> only has 3 percent. Over $75,000 has been wagered so far.</p>

 <p>From there<em> Split Fiction</em>, <em>The Oute Worlds 2</em>, <em>Kingdom Come: Deliverance II</em>, <em>Donkey Kong Bananza</em>, <em>Elden Ring: Nightreign</em>, and <em>Blue Prince</em> all have at least a percentage point. <em>Ghost of Yotei</em> and every other game that came out this year, on the other hand, are all at decimal points. Shockingly, there is over $900 of betting volume on <em>Grand Theft Auto 6</em>, a game which is not coming out this year. I guess someone didn’t get the memo.</p>

 <h2>The <em>Clair Obscur </em>GOTY train keeps chugging along</h2> <p>What can we make of all this? Remember, prediction markets aren’t an indication of what will happen, they’re a measure of what people&nbsp;<em>think</em> might happen. The complete domination of <em>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</em> could mean that lots of people played it and think it’s great, or it could just mean people who like placing wagers on Polymarket are seeing how jazzed everyone else is about the game and trying to refine that online noise into quantifiable signals.</p>

 <p><em>Polygon</em>‘s Oli Welsh, who maintains a rolling list of GOTY frontrunners based on a mix of experience, vibes, and data, has had <em>Clair Obscur</em> <a href="https://www.polygon.com/awards/546327/game-of-the-year-game-awards-2025-frontrunners/">in the lead for a while</a>. Maybe Polymarket users are taking their cues from him! One of the only variations from the current betting landscape is that he has<em> Yotei </em>in closer contention, even if it’s still an outside shot. If you look at Metacritic, however, <em>Hades 2</em> technically has a higher composite review score from all of the aggregated critics. Those are the people who do most of the voting, after all.</p> <p>The actual mechanics of how various outlets vote, from magazines like <em>Game Informer</em> to YouTube groups like <em>Easy Allies</em>, probably play an even bigger role in deciding the outcome than ambient industry vibes. Some ballots are decided on purely by the head of those outlets. Others do informal internal voting. Some might make choices based on what they&nbsp;<em>think</em> is supposed to be the right answer, just like the Polymarket folks are doing. Others might decide based purely on what the most people at that outlet played and liked. Often passion carries the day. Five people really liking game X might not carry the day against three who think Y is the most important game of the decade.</p> <p>Will that messy, inconsistent process yield <em>Clair Obscur</em> as the winner this year? The users on Polymarket clearly think so. We won’t know until the paper envelope is opened on stage by the <a href="https://kotaku.com/game-awards-2024-rebirth-astro-bot-winners-goty-list-1851720291">makers of last year’s winner<em>, Astro Bot</em></a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Laptops that are specifically designed with gamers and creatives in mind usually don’t come cheap. While the exact price depends on the configuration, most of the powerful options out there with solid graphics easily cross the $1,000 mark. Thankfully, that changes today.</p>
<p>Amazon has slashed the price of the latest <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5200/">16-inch HP Elitebook (AMD Ryzen 5, 32GB DDR5 RAM and 1TB PCIe SSD) down to $859, after an unbelievable $1,540 discount on the retail price of $2,399</a>. This is the lowest we have seen this machine drop to in a long while, and we don’t expect the offer to be around for long. It’s best to grab yours before it’s too late. There’s no telling if this discount will return for Black Friday or if the stock will even last that long.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5200/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Reliable Performance for Both Work and Play</h2>
<p>Like most HP laptops, this machine comes in a sleek, lightweight build with a premium finish. The screen is a 16-inch diagonal Anti-Glare WUXGA display that delivers sharp, bright visuals. 400 nits of brightness keep everything clear in all lighting conditions, while blue light support makes all-nighters easier on your eyes. It’s also paired with Radeon 740M graphics, which can handle streaming and gaming without stutters.</p>
<p>There’s a spill-resistant, backlit keyboard that’s quite comfortable to use for longer sessions. Calls are made easy with a 5MP camera paired with Poly Studio-tuned speakers and AI noise reduction – you’ll look your best, and sound just as good.</p>



<p>For power, you’re getting a 6-core AMD Ryzen 5 processor that can clock up to 4.9GHz; perfect for heavier workloads. Even better, it’s backed by 32GB of DDR5 RAM for some impressive multitasking, plus a 1TB PCIe NVMe SSD that offers much faster boot times than traditional drives. 1TB is also enough space to store all your essentials, from media content to work documents and games.</p>
<p>Connectivity-wise, it comes with Wi-Fi 6E and Bluetooth 5.3 for wireless connections, plus a full selection of ports including HDMI 2.1, Ethernet, two USB-A ports, and two Thunderbolt 4 USB-C ports.</p>
<p>The machine runs on Windows 11 Pro, meaning you’ll enjoy a bunch of productivity features right from the get-go. Microsoft Copilot takes the experience even further by assisting you with your day-to-day tasks. It can quickly pull answers to questions, summarize content, and help you stay organized. If you’ve been looking for a powerful upgrade without blowing your budget, this deal is worth grabbing.</p>

              <p>As we enter into the holiday season, there’s one event in particular to look forward to and that’s Black Friday (and to a lesser extent, Cyber Monday). It’s a great time to get some of your gift shopping wrapped up, or for you to get some gifts for yourself while saving some cash. Even though we’ve still got a few more weeks to go, you can find some Black Friday-level deals at Amazon if you look hard enough.</p>
<p>For the PC gamers out there – if you’ve been on the hunt for a new gaming monitor, you can right <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5199/">now save 40% on this LG UltraGear display: It normally goes for $499, so after the discount, it comes down to just $299</a>.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5199/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<p>This 27-inch gaming monitor from LG is capable of a QHD resolution of 2560 by 1440 pixels. It can achieve high frames per second with its 240Hz refresh rate. And with a 1ms response time, you can expect your controls to feel responsive and snappy. Don’t discount the importance of a fast input time. It could be the difference between feeling like light on your feet or feeling like you’re moving through mud. I’ve been playing&nbsp;<em>Hollow Knight: Silksong&nbsp;</em>at first on an old 2017 Vizio TV on my Xbox, but recently moved over to a new monitor for my PC and it’s night and day. The platforming sections have become a breeze.</p>
<p>The display has smooth visuals with vivid colors and high-resolution graphics made possible via the HDMI 2.1 input and DisplayPort 1.4 input. Both allow for up to 240Hz as well.</p>



<h2>A Display Meant for Gaming</h2>
<p>A number of features are implemented specifically to aid with gameplay. Switch between preset modes with adjusted settings, optimized for general gaming, FPS games, or RTS games. The Black Stabilizer will increase detail in dark spots so you can easily see enemies hiding in the shadows. The FPS counter and display your real-time data so you can ensure you’re games are running optimally.</p>
<p>The headphone jack is capable of sending over accurate spatialization and localization for games that support 3D audio. Fully immerse yourself in you game, hearing sound from all directions.</p>
<p>The stand is fully adjustable. The LG UltraGear can be slid up and down and titled forward and back. This allows you to perfectly position it in your sight line and even adjust it as you play as your posture changes. Always have the best view possible. If you’re using this as a secondary monitor, you can consider turning the display to stand vertically. This can be great for save space on your desk as well as to read through messages over Discord or Slack in a separate window.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>One of <a href="https://kotaku.com/borderlands-4-the-kotaku-review-bugs-pc-performance-ending-gearbox-ps5-2000627149"><em>Borderlands 4</em></a>‘s most overpowered weapons, if not the most OP, is a simple Throwing Knife with a Penetrator augment. It boosts your chance of critical hits and makes it easy to melt bosses in the process. Gearbox Entertainment has been trying to nerf the player-favorite “crit knife” for weeks but it keeps messing up, and now it’s back with a vengeance.</p> <p>Back when the game launched, the Penetrator augment increased your crit chance to 100 percent for five seconds. With the right loadout, that was more than enough time to completely deplete even some of the biggest enemy health pools. Here it is in action:</p>

 <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">Lmao crit knife absolutely needs to be nerfed <a href="https://t.co/gXxYoZjSfE">pic.twitter.com/gXxYoZjSfE</a></p> <p>— Nick (@TheOneSoVile) <a href="https://twitter.com/TheOneSoVile/status/1977528266425848227?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 13, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <p>So the developers committed to nerfing the crit knife to bring some semblance of balance back to the meta, or at least spice it up a bunch.&nbsp; This balance patch was due out in early October but got delayed a couple of times. When it finally arrived via the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Borderlands4/comments/1oe72cs/borderlands_4_update_notes_october_23_2025/">October 23 update</a>, the crit knife was reworked to provide only a 30-percent increase in critical hit chance for the duration of the buff. But that’s not exactly how it worked in practice.</p>

 <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">ATTENTION BORDERLANDS GAMERS! <br>The new crit knife sets your crit chance to a target at 30%, it DOES NOT ADD 30% Crit Chance. Meaning if you have above 30% crit chance throwing it will hurt your damage. <br>Chatter mentioned <a href="https://twitter.com/Lazy_Data?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@Lazy_Data</a> figured this out and I just tested to confirm. <a href="https://t.co/cAnElpK3Gl">pic.twitter.com/cAnElpK3Gl</a></p> <p>— Moxsy (@MoxsyOG) <a href="https://twitter.com/MoxsyOG/status/1981523204800749596?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 24, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <p>Instead, <em>Borderlands 4</em> players quickly realized that instead of giving them an additional 30 percent crit chance, the Penetrator Augment was setting a flat rate of 30 percent crit chance for all attacks during the five-second timeframe. That meant that if you started with a higher crit chance for whatever reason, using the new crit knife would actually bring it down. This took the Throwing Knife from good but not great to actively bad. So Gearbox pushed out <a href="https://borderlands.2k.com/borderlands-4/update-notes/">another update</a> to make it work as intended.</p>

 <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">100% CRIT KNIFE IS BACK!</p> <p>Yeah you just throw it 3 times now lmao and get 90%. a 4th to go over or just have any other crit chance. </p> <p>Silly but yeah. lmao. This damn knife dude. <a href="https://t.co/R2d8yI3TZT">pic.twitter.com/R2d8yI3TZT</a></p> <p>— LazyData (@Lazy_Data) <a href="https://twitter.com/Lazy_Data/status/1984024985414070688?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 30, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <p>Except that the new patch added an entirely new bug. Now, the Penetrator Augment does give players an&nbsp;<em>additional</em> 30 percent crit chance, but even more importantly it actually stacks the crit chance with other uses of the knife. That means you can still get up to a maximum of 90 percent crit chance with it during that five-second window. A multi-week-long nerf dance has effectively concluded with the dreaded crit knife meta back in action and nearly as good as it was at the beginning of October.</p> <p>It seems all but guaranteed at this point that Gearbox will patch this bug out in the days ahead. It remains to be seen, though, whether that arrives via a hotfix sometime this weekend or is held until the next weekly update on November 7. It seems fans of the crit knife are getting one last <a href="https://kotaku.com/new-halloween-event-borderlands-4-sucks-bad-horrors-of-kairos-2000638842">unexpected treat this Halloween</a>.</p>
