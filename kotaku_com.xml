It’s now been revealed that its replacement, <em>Animal Crossing: Pocket Camp Complete</em>, will appear December 3, and ditch all of the 2017 game’s microtransactions for a one-off sum. Except, the sum is huge, the game’s losing features, and there’s no exception for long-time players of the original <em>Pocket Camp</em>.<br></p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="196626" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="Who Is The Best Hang In Unicorn Overlord?

The company has also been quick to shut down games that aren’t performing as wanted, to the disappointment of long-term players, with a bunch of different mobile titles—including <em>Dragalia Lost</em> and <em>Dr. Mario World</em>—canned since the mobile ventures began in 2016.</p><p><em>Pocket Camp</em>’s situation isn’t <em>quite </em>as final as others, like <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/mario-kart-tour-new-content-end-mobile-racer-spinoff-1850825190&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/mario-kart-tour-new-content-end-mobile-racer-spinoff-1850825190"><em>Mario Kart Tour</em>’s no longer receiving updates</a></span> since the end of 2023. Instead, people who’ve been playing the <em>Animal Crossing </em>game since its 2017 release will be able to transfer across their progress to the new game. But only after paying a whopping $20 entry fee. And it will only be updated for another year. And it’s losing features. And oh boy this doesn’t look great.</p><figure id="" data-id="8cb4892420c49631ee69eef927da437d" data-recommend-id="image://8cb4892420c49631ee69eef927da437d" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="720" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="An Animal Crossing character, very happy at a picnic." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="An Animal Crossing character, very happy at a picnic." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Nintendo / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="8cb4892420c49631ee69eef927da437d" data-recommend-id="image://8cb4892420c49631ee69eef927da437d" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="720" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="An Animal Crossing character, very happy at a picnic." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>There’s something of a concession toward just how <em>enormous </em>a price this is for a mobile game people may have already spent vast sums on previously—for the first two months, Nintendo will be charging half that much, ending on January 31, 2025. Still, another $10 is a kick in the eye for those who’ve invested over the last seven years.<br></p><p><em>Pocket Camp Complete</em> doesn’t mark a  step forward for the game, but rather will see it continuing with a slightly reduced set of features, and the promise of one more year of updates. If you’ve got an established village, it’ll all transfer over, along with all your Friendship Levels, but not your leaf tickets, which are <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://faq.ac-pocketcamp.com/hc/en-us/articles/36088777921945-What-happens-to-my-Leaf-Tickets&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://faq.ac-pocketcamp.com/hc/en-us/articles/36088777921945-What-happens-to-my-Leaf-Tickets" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">being removed entirely</a></span>. But in a really surprising move, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://faq.ac-pocketcamp.com/hc/en-us/articles/36353725150489-What-is-Animal-Crossing-Pocket-Camp-Complete&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://faq.ac-pocketcamp.com/hc/en-us/articles/36353725150489-What-is-Animal-Crossing-Pocket-Camp-Complete" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Nintendo makes clear on its update page</a></span> that “There is no discount specifically for <em>Animal Crossing: Pocket Camp</em> users.”</p><p>Why not?! What a deeply peculiar move, to not reward those who’ve been subscribing for $3 to $8 a month since 2019, when subs began! The game costs the same for me, who has never played, as for the person who’s put in $480 in subscription fees.</p><p>Various online features are getting ditched, such as sharing gifts and the Market Box, and <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://faq.ac-pocketcamp.com/hc/en-us/articles/38847775801625-About-Friends-in-Pocket-Camp-Complete&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://faq.ac-pocketcamp.com/hc/en-us/articles/38847775801625-About-Friends-in-Pocket-Camp-Complete" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">interacting with other islands is becoming a whole weird ordeal</a></span>.

Who knows? This may be timed to overlap with the release of a new <em>Animal Crossing </em>game for the Switch 2, given the normal release schedule of the series suggests one should be due.</p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
