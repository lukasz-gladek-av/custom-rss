(According to the trailer’s description on YouTube all footage was captured on a PC.) </p><p>Apparently this is actual gameplay, or at least in-engine. (According to the trailer’s description on YouTube all footage was captured on a PC.)</p><p>The game is being developed by genDESIGN. In the trailer we can see a person climbing aboard a giant mech and then seemingly taking off in the head of the mech because its actually a giant spaceship... thing. I don’t know what’s going on, but it looks cool!</p><p> Fumito Ueda is famous for directing and creating beloved PS2 games Ico and <em>Shadow of the Colossus.</em> He then helped lead development on <em>The Last Guardian</em> via his own studio, genDESIGN. While that game wasn’t as popular as <em>Ico </em>or <em>Shadow of the Colossus</em>, it still maintined the same vibes as the Ueda’s previous titles. </p><p>It still seems like this is very early and probably a couple years away. I mean, it doesn’t even have a title yet! Still, I’m excited to check it out because Ueda’s past work is awesome and him making a sci-fi game has me very, as the kids say, hyped. Hopefully it has a less rocky development timeline than Ueda’s last game, <em>The Last Guardian,</em> and we get to play it sooner than later. For now, we wait and think about that giant mech head. </p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Which, hey, I get it. </p><p>“I think this guy did a great job,” said Ford in reference to Baker’s performance in the new game. “If I’d known he was so good, I would have done it myself.” </p><p>After that, there was an awkward pause as Ford clearly didn’t want to say whatever was on the prompter and signaled for the teleprompter to move on to the award part, which it did as everyone laughed quietly and the trio moved on to handing out the award for best performance. </p><p>The winner of the award wasn’t Troy Baker, but instead Melina Juergens for her stellar performance as the main character in <em>Senua’s Saga: Hellblade II</em>. That means she’s won the award twice. And meanwhile, Troy Baker has still yet to win it, something Todd Howard joked about during the segment. Don’t feel bad Troy, Harrison Ford liked your performance and he’s never won a single Game Award, either. You are in good company. </p><p> .</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
