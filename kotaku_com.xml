The Fire Pokémon Mass Outbreak Event doesn’t give you new single player challenges to overcome, so don’t worry about putting together that Misty deck you’ve been meaning to build. Instead, this one specifically rewards those who love checking in on their Wonder Pick options throughout the day.</p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="196165" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="What’s Coming Out Beyond Pokémon: The Indigo Disk | The Week In Games" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="95" data-playlist="196165,192995,196663" data-current="196165"><div><p>What’s Coming Out Beyond Pokémon: The Indigo Disk | The Week In Games</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196165/196165_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196165/196165_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196165/196165_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196165/196165_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/21711.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>Here’s how the Fire Pokémon Mass Outbreak event works: From now until November 28, a special “Bonus Pick” option will appear in the Wonder Pick menu. <strong>This will let you pick one of five fire-type cards at random for no cost, so you should always take a Bonus Pick whenever you see it</strong>. These can appear several times throughout the day, so make sure to check in on your Wonder Picks whenever you decide to play. At the same time, you’ll occasionally see “Rare Picks” pop up in the Wonder Pick menu, which will feature a fittingly rarer selection of cards. Rare Picks do cost Wonder Stamina, which takes 36 hours to naturally refill.</p><p>Let’s go over what exactly you’ll get here:</p><figure id="" data-id="82d707b7ad87a595c988cf7872247ea7" data-recommend-id="image://82d707b7ad87a595c988cf7872247ea7" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A screenshot of the Fire Pokémon Mass Outbreak Event in Pokémon TCG Pocket shows an option called “Bonus Pick” is shown, and it costs no Wonder Stamina to use." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A screenshot of the Fire Pokémon Mass Outbreak Event in Pokémon TCG Pocket shows an option called “Bonus Pick” is shown, and it costs no Wonder Stamina to use." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->The Pokemon Company / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="82d707b7ad87a595c988cf7872247ea7" data-recommend-id="image://82d707b7ad87a595c988cf7872247ea7" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A screenshot of the Fire Pokémon Mass Outbreak Event in Pokémon TCG Pocket shows an option called “Bonus Pick” is shown, and it costs no Wonder Stamina to use." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><h2 id="h191080"><a id="bonus"></a>All Cards You Can Get From Bonus Picks</h2><p>The pool of cards that can appear as Bonus Picks are as follows:</p><blockquote data-type="BlockQuote"><p><strong>Charmander</strong></p><p><strong>Charmeleon</strong></p><p><strong>Vulpix</strong></p><p><strong>Ninetales</strong></p><p><strong>Ponyta</strong></p><p><strong>Rapidash</strong></p><p><strong>Growlithe</strong></p><p><strong>Magmar</strong></p><p><strong>Heatmor</strong></p><p><strong>Blaine</strong></p></blockquote><p>Again, Bonus Picks are literally free, so even if the cards are all terrible it’d still be worth grabbing. That said, the Charmander, Vulpix, and Ponyta evolution lines can help flesh out Fire decks, especially if you can pair them with a Blaine trainer card.

Arcanine EX is the rarest pick here, but it’s not exactly a “meta” card. 120 damage for three energy can counter Pikachu EX cards that consistently pop up in online matches, so you definitely shouldn’t write it off. That said, you have no actual guarantee of grabbing one given how Wonder Picks work, so you’ll have to weigh whether the risk is worth the reward. You can get a Wonder Hourglass and a Shop Ticket from pulling an Arcanine EX during the event, but that’s more of a nice perk than a reason to chase the card specifically.</p><p>Fortunately, unlike most regular Wonder Picks, your consolation prizes are pretty good here. As alluded to above, Ninetales and Rapidash can be deadly if paired with Blaine. You’ll need Charmeleon if you want to build <em>any</em> Charizard deck. And if you don’t have Charizard or Moltres yet, this is a good opportunity to fill out your collection. <br></p><p>Is it worthwhile to dump all your stored Wonder Hourglasses on Rare Picks whenever you see them? Well, unless you don’t have any of these cards in your collection, you probably don’t <em>need</em> to relentlessly chase these. But is this a good way to use the Wonder Stamina you’ve already stored and are looking to spend? Definitely, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/pokemon-tcg-pocket-premium-pass-ui-features-1851705873&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-tcg-pocket-premium-pass-ui-features-1851705873">so long as you don’t get tilted seeing all the cards you wanted more flip over afterwards</a></span>. <br></p><p>.<br></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

He told the outlet that while staying at a Hampton Inn outside of Pittsburgh, he tried to take a shortcut to a restaurant down a steep hill instead of walking a “mile and a half down the road.” He lost his footing and rolled down the hill, hitting several rocks on a small dirt path on his way down. As a result of his fall he broke his wrist, lost a fingernail, gave himself a big shiner on his left eye and bruised much of his face. Three hours later, Leno—now wearing an eye patch—did his comedy show as planned, then went to a hospital after arriving back in Los Angeles, he says. </p><p>Jay Leno did in fact fall down a small but steep hill and got injured. That much is true. And if that’s good enough for you, then you can stop reading right now. But I have questions about everything else. </p><h2 id="h182277"><a id=""></a>Questions about Jay Leno’s Fall</h2><p>For starters, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://youtu.be/tMymyMOpjPw&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://youtu.be/tMymyMOpjPw" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>Inside Edition</em> later reported</a></span> that after his fall, Leno arrived at a restaurant near the hotel called The Boulevard and ordered a chicken parm. The manager of the restaurant told<em> Inside Edition </em>that Leno arrived at the place without a reservation for lunch, ordered the dish with some garlic bread and then left. </p><p>However, The Boulevard is a restaurant located about 750 feet away from the hotel. That’s not <em>too </em>far away, but Leno told <em>Inside Edition</em> he didn’t have a car at the time. (Which is very ironic considering <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://news.dupontregistry.com/jay-lenos-garage/jay-lenos-car-collection/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://news.dupontregistry.com/jay-lenos-garage/jay-lenos-car-collection/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">how many cars this dude owns</a></span>.) </p><figure id="" data-id="5bab8b2aa3ae305c2aea1d89df31e74f" data-recommend-id="image://5bab8b2aa3ae305c2aea1d89df31e74f" data-format="png" data-width="848" data-height="640" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Leno's path to the Boulevard from his hotel." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Leno's path to the Boulevard from his hotel." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Leno’s path to the Boulevard from his hotel.

They suggest that Leno was craving some Buffalo wings and took the dirt path that had been cut into the hill by other people taking that same shortcut, didn’t realize how steep it was, and fell. </p><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.tmz.com/2024/11/19/jay-leno-injured-face-after-fall-wears-eye-patch/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.tmz.com/2024/11/19/jay-leno-injured-face-after-fall-wears-eye-patch/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">And this makes sense because in a different interview with <em>TMZ</em></a></span>, Leno says that someone at the hotel told him that there was a a good place to eat at “the bottom of this hill.” That sounds like someone pointing Leno to the sports bar at the bottom of the small hill, and not the restaurant up the road for some chicken parm.</p><figure id="" data-id="9aca5b9b56d562a0742a84e724b999b2" data-recommend-id="image://9aca5b9b56d562a0742a84e724b999b2" data-format="png" data-width="950" data-height="690" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Leno's path from the hotel to the sports bar located at the bottom of the hill.

" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Adding credence to this theory is the fact after his tumble, Leno visited a local CVS and bought an eye patch, as documented by a worker via a selfie. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://maps.app.goo.gl/qW9Ut4wZRQ3M4jje7&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://maps.app.goo.gl/qW9Ut4wZRQ3M4jje7" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The nearest CVS is just up the road from the sports bar</a></span>. </p><p>And yet, there’s the small problem that nobody at the sports bar remembers Leno entering and ordering anything that day. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://triblive.com/local/westmoreland/jay-leno-injured-after-fall-down-hillside-in-westmoreland-county/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://triblive.com/local/westmoreland/jay-leno-injured-after-fall-down-hillside-in-westmoreland-county/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Local news site <em>Triblive </em>reports</a></span> that the manager on shift that day doesn’t remember Leno showing up, and nobody he asked could recall seeing the comedian eat some wings. </p><p>So that seems to indicate that the manager at The Boulevard was telling the truth and that Leno walked down to the joint, had some chicken parm, and then left short after falling down the hill and hurting himself. But it’s also possible that someone is trying to spin a good story so a major news outlet will highlight the location for some free publicity.</p><h2 id="h182278"><a id=""></a>What (Probably) Happened, Maybe... </h2><p>I’ve tried to piece together the stories and comments from Leno and everyone else, and I think this is what happened. </p><p>Leno was told he could get some food at a place down the hill from the hotel. He walks out, tries to take a shortcut, and falls. Injured, he likely calls someone (or someone is with him and sees it happen) and they grab a car. </p><p>At this point, someone points out that the restaurant is actually down the road and not in the parking lot near the hotel. So they head over to The Boulevard, Leno orders his chicken parm, eats it, and they drive back up that same road to the CVS at the intersection. He gets what he needs, takes a selfie, and then they continue back on East Pittsburgh street and arrive at the theater so he can do his show. </p><p>Or, Leno got mixed up as to when or where he fell and not everyone remembers what happened clearly and he did eat some wings at that sports bar but nobody noticed because, I mean, how big a star is Jay Leno in 2024? And maybe later Leno had chicken parm at that other place for dinner and the manager is confused about the timing. </p><p>Now I’m going to put away my maps and red string and stop thinking about this. Enjoy your Friday and the rest of the weekend. And be careful walking down hills. </p><p> .<br></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Scovill crowdsourced info from Lego enthusiasts on Reddit and Discord to narrow down the most potentially painful pieces he should research and then used increasingly elaborate instruments to test them.</p><p>First, Scovill used a series of carboard squares pressed onto the Lego pieces in question to record their “gradient of damage” and used a constructed, weighted arm slapping down on the cardboard to simulate the weight of a foot press. Pointed flames, wizard hats, and retro plastic trees all did some of the worst damage.</p><div><p>Not content to judge using the cardboard alone, Scovill also decided to make an entire foot out of ballistic gel. This would record the damage in more detail, and also allow pieces to become lodged deep inside the material if the simulated accident went that poorly. So what Lego piece actually ended up being the most danagerous?</p><p>One you’ve probably never heard of. It’s a <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.ebay.com/itm/253341120598&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.ebay.com/itm/253341120598" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">red wheel</a></span> with a metal pin in it that Lego stopped producing long ago. Back before the company’s engineers and manufacturing processes were as high-tech and refined as they are today, there were some Lego pieces that actually relied on metal to complete the connection. These red wheels, if stepped on hard at just the right angle,  bring more than a little <em>Home Alone</em>-style pain. Scovill remarks that you’d probably want to make sure your tetanus shots were up-to-date if you got nailed by one of them. </p></div><p>Fortunately for most of us, the pain of stepping on Lego can be exorcised with a few colorful expletives. </p><p>.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

The <em>Monsters, Inc.</em> area will also include new dining and shopping options as well as a “whole new theater show.”</p><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://disneyparksblog.com/wdw/monsters-inc-the-muppets-hollywood-studios/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://disneyparksblog.com/wdw/monsters-inc-the-muppets-hollywood-studios/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">In the blog post announcing the news</a></span>, Disney confirmed that it was having “creative conversations” about how to “preserve the [Muppet*Vision 3D] film” and other parts of the show so fans can “enjoy” it all in the future.</p><p>“To make way for the monsters, Kermit the Frog, Miss Piggy and more of their friends will be moving right along to Sunset Boulevard,” said Disney.  </p><p>What that actually means is that the Rock ‘n’ Roller Coaster, which opened in 1999 in Hollywood Studios, will be re-themed as a Muppets ride featuring various characters from the franchise. Goodbye, Aerosmith, the band the ride has been attached to since it opened. Apparently, Disney also plans to have “music’s biggest stars” team up with the Muppets, but didn’t share any details on what that will entail. </p><p>As with any change to a Disney Park, there was a mix of excitement from some online as well as a lot of complaints. Many older fans aren’t happy that Disney is removing more of the park’s history and replacing it with more movie tie-in rides and areas. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.wdwinfo.com/walt-disney-world/walt-disney-world-is-paving-over-rivers-of-america-to-put-up-a-parking-lot/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.wdwinfo.com/walt-disney-world/walt-disney-world-is-paving-over-rivers-of-america-to-put-up-a-parking-lot/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">In August 2024</a></span>, Disney announced plans to remove the Rivers of America and replace it with a new <em>Cars</em>-inspired area and ride. </p><p>The Muppet*Vision 3D attraction and show isn’t closing right away and Disney says people will have time to enjoy it one last time.
