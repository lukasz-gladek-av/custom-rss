              <p>When I woke up this morning, I didn’t expect I’d see a new live-action, <a href="https://kotaku.com/power-rangers-black-yellow-racial-stereotypes-1851775454">1990s-inspired <em>Power Rangers</em> </a>clip featuring Peely from <a href="https://kotaku.com/games/fortnite"><em>Fortnite</em></a>. And I really didn’t expect to be so blown away by it that I’d end up rewatching the ad like five times. Yet here we are.</p> <p>On August 5, ahead of the release of <em>Fortnite’s</em> Chapter 6 Season 4 later this week, Epic Games released a live-action teaser trailer confirming that the original <em>Power Rangers</em> will be a part of the game’s upcoming season. Normally, I would not waste your time sharing trailers or teasers for random video game updates. But this trailer is just so awesome that I have to share it, if only so I can watch it a few more times and say it was for my job so I don’t feel as guilty. Here’s the ’90s-inspired live-action trailer, complete with <a href="https://youtu.be/MXSWM9Z5Stk">everything you’d expect from the OG show</a>, including cheap-looking special effects and all the action taking place in a quarry.</p> <p><iframe loading="lazy" title="Bad Bugs vs Power Rangers in Fortnite BR: Shock ‘N Awesome | Live Action Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="about:blank" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen="" data-rocket-lazyload="fitvidscompatible" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/7ZIbokU9tRg?feature=oembed"></iframe></p> <p><a href="https://x.com/Fortnite/status/1952731322994012178?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Etweet">The upcoming “Shock ‘N Awesome” season</a> will feature an invasion of deadly alien bugs, and it seems that the Power Rangers are being called in for backup. They have beaten up a lot of dudes in rubber bug suits, so they can likely help out. <a href="https://gizmodo.com/fortnite-chapter-6-season-4-trailer-power-rangers-release-date-skins-2000638994">As pointed out by <em>Gizmodo</em>,</a> this wild trailer is some of the first new live-action<em> Power Rangers</em> content created and aired since 2023. I can imagine that for big fans of the franchise, this is an odd moment. You finally got some cool new<em> Power Rangers</em> action, but it arrives as part of a <em>Fortnite</em> trailer. The universe is strange like that.</p> <p><em>Fortnite’s</em> next big season, Shock ‘N Awesome, arrives on August 7 on all platforms where the game is available.</p>

              <p>Today’s Morning Checkpoint–<em>Kotaku’s</em> daily round-up of news and other stuff you might care about–is filled with some good news, like new awesome retro game music being added to the Nintendo Music app, and also some bad news, like <em>IGN</em> losing more staff members as parent company Ziff Davis continues to make cuts. We also have some new and intriguing data on how popular (or not popular) video game engine Unity is in 2025, and more.</p> <h2>Stop Killing Games Enters Its Next Stage: Waiting</h2> <p><iframe loading="lazy" title="Stop Killing Games: Wrap up" width="500" height="281" src="about:blank" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen="" data-rocket-lazyload="fitvidscompatible" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/FNkwxlLdkSo?feature=oembed"></iframe></p> <p>For the past year, Ross Scott’s campaign against game publishers shutting down online games completely and making them unplayable has been quite active. But now, the Stop Killing Games campaign has entered a new phase which is mostly about waiting to see what happens. That’s because the campaign’s biggest focus, an EU petition asking for lawmakers to pressure publishers into keeping games playable, is no longer accepting signatures. Now, in a new “wrap-up” video for Stop Killing Games, Scott says he’s going to take a break while he waits to see what happens, but he has assured supporters that he’ll pop back up if and when he’s needed.</p> <h2>More layoffs at the biggest gaming site, <em>IGN</em></h2> <p>On August 4, <em>IGN</em> parent company Ziff Davis laid off eight more staff members, as confirmed by the IGN Creator’s Guild Union. This follows additional layoffs at Ziff Davis and comes months after the multibillion-dollar company pushed some employees out via buyouts. Last year, three <em>IGN</em> staffers were laid off.</p>

 <p>“The company has told us that the reason for this layoff stems from a Ziff Davis-mandate to cut costs despite several quarters in a row of year-over-year revenue increases, to which IGN Entertainment responded by coming for our members’ jobs,” <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/ignunion.bsky.social/post/3lvm4rhup5k2a">explained the IGN Union in a message posted to social media</a>. “This is perplexing to us, as we are told again and again that IGN Entertainment has had a tremendously successful year thus far thanks to their hard work.”</p> <h2>All the songs from <em>Pilotwings</em> games are available on Nintendo’s music app</h2> <p>Nintendo continues to update and expand its Nintendo Online subscriber-only music player app. On August 5, the company added the full soundtracks from the entire <em>Pilotwings</em> series, which includes<em> Pilotwings, Pilotwings 64, </em>and <em>Pilotwings Resort</em>, to the Nintendo Music app. As with most other songs in the app, these tracks can be extended and looped for up to an hour. Finally, you can listen to the excellent song “<a href="https://youtu.be/s1vfrMel8iI?t=15">Flight Club</a>” for as long as you desire while doing something else.</p> <h2>The Switch 2 might be getting smaller game cart sizes</h2> <p>Taiwanese tech company Marconix, which is the company responsible for creating the game carts used by Nintendo for the Switch 2, <a href="https://nintendosoup.com/taiwanese-manufacturers-fiscal-update-could-hint-at-more-storage-sizes-for-switch-2-game-cards/">revealed in its latest fiscal update</a> that it is planning to produce carts in more capacity sizes. Currently, there is only one large 64 GB option, which is handy for big games like<em> Cyberpunk 2077</em>, but is a very expensive option for smaller games that don’t need all that space. <a href="https://kotaku.com/switch-2-nintendo-survey-game-key-carts-2000614465">This has likely contributed to the high number of third-party publishers opting for game key cards</a> on Switch 2. Hopefully, these new size options from Marconix will mean fewer publishers use the controversial game key card option in the future.</p>

 <h2>Unity is becoming a less popular engine for game devs</h2> <p>In 2021, around 60 percent of game devs who participated in the Game Maker’s Toolkit Game Jam were using Unity. Now, new data from the popular YouTube channel reveals that in 2025, only 41 percent of the submitted games are using Unity. Many devs seem to be moving to Godot, a free and open-source game engine that has become more and more popular following some really dumb moves by Unity.</p>   <p>Back in 2023, Unity announced a series of controversial runtime fees that would cost devs a lot of money if their games became popular and were installed by many users. The company eventually walked back some and <a href="https://kotaku.com/unity-install-runtime-fees-canceled-ceo-blog-post-price-1851647405">then eventually all of these plans</a>, but the whole ordeal left a sour taste in the mouths of many developers. And while this is just data from one game jam, it still seems to show that Unity might have to do a lot to win back smaller devs who don’t trust the company anymore.</p> <h2>ICYMI:</h2> <ul> <li><a href="https://kotaku.com/skyblivion-skyrim-oblivion-elder-scrolls-mod-remake-remaster-2000614628">The Other, Fan-Made <em>Oblivion</em> Remake Just Got An Awesome New Trailer</a></li> <li><a href="https://kotaku.com/and-roger-review-tearyhand-studio-pc-steam-switch-2000614568">One Of 2025’s Most Special, Emotional Games Is $5 And Will Take You An Hour To Finish</a></li> <li><a href="https://kotaku.com/baldurs-gate-3-director-teases-next-crazy-thing-sequel-2000614546"><em>Baldur’s Gate 3</em> Director Teases Studio’s ‘Next Crazy Thing’</a></li> </ul>
