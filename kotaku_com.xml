              <p>The other shoe has dropped at Cloud Chamber. Following an internal delay and management shakeup, the studio making <em>BioShock 4</em> has now laid off 80 people, <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-08-20/take-two-guts-bioshock-studio-after-a-decade-of-development"><em>Bloomberg</em> reports</a>. Originally, the sequel had supposedly been targeting a late 2026 release, but it will likely take longer now as significant aspects of the game, including the story, are reworked.</p> <p>Layoffs announced on Tuesday amounted to about a third of the staff at the roughly 250-person studio. According to <em>Bloomberg</em>, the next <em>BioShock</em> has gone through multiple studios and leadership teams over the last decade, with problems arising at Cloud Chamber in part due to the need to create a new studio while also meeting sky-high expectations for the franchise. One of the stumbling blocks was reportedly its rapid growth and the game’s shift to the newest version of Unreal Engine.</p> <p>“While we’re excited about the foundational gameplay elements of the project, we’ve made the decision with studio leadership to rework certain aspects that are core to a <em>BioShock</em> game, and in doing so are reducing the size of the development team to focus on this work and give the game more time in development,” 2K Games president David Ismailer <a href="https://kotaku.com/bioshock-4-delay-layoffs-rod-fergusson-diablo-gears-2000618449">wrote in a memo to staff</a> this week that was shared with <em>Kotaku</em>.</p> <p><em>Bloomberg</em> <a href="https://kotaku.com/bioshock-4-delay-cloud-chamber-2k-take-two-remake-2000614413">reported</a> earlier this month that<em> BioShock</em> 4’s latest stumble occurred following a negative internal review with executives, with particular concern about the game’s narrative. Publicly, 2K Games has said that the new <em>BioShock</em> is good but not good enough. “Some of our competitors have realized maybe a little late in the day that consumers are not okay with okay,” Strauss Zelnick, CEO of 2K parent company Take-Two, <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/bioshock-4-is-going-to-come-out-take-two-ceo-strauss-zelnick-promises-that-i-can-say-hand-on-heart-without-question">told <em>IGN</em></a> in a recent interview. Industry veteran Rod Fergusson is now leading the project, <a href="https://kotaku.com/bioshock-infinite-update-multiplayer-modes-cut-gears-5933119">the second time</a> he’s been tasked with clawing a <em>BioShock</em> game out of development hell.</p>
