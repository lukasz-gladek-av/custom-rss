Games, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://variety.com/2024/tv/news/harry-potter-franchise-future-tv-series-video-games-1236201249/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://variety.com/2024/tv/news/harry-potter-franchise-future-tv-series-video-games-1236201249/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">told <em>Variety</em> in a new interview</a></span>. “Our insights tell us that there are not huge distinctions between a younger version of a fan and an older version of a fan. They’re just deep<em> Harry Potter </em>fans, and we try to build authentic experiences to delight them.”</p><p> Those experiences include <em>Hogwarts Legacy 2</em>, which, while not officially announced yet, is a “one of the biggest priorities” for the publisher, and an HBO series that will give the original books the <em>Game of Thrones </em>treatment. Here’s an excerpt from the<em> Variety</em> piece:</p><blockquote data-type="BlockQuote"><p>Haddad says the games team has been coordinating some of the big-picture storytelling elements in the “Hogwarts Legacy” sequel with the storylines that will play out in the “Harry Potter” HBO series coming from Warner Bros. Television. He notes that the success of “Hogwarts Legacy” helped stoke confidence that the time was right to make a major Potter push: “The rest of the company was very curious about what we helped to unlock with ‘Hogwarts Legacy’ last year.”</p></blockquote><p>Warner Bros. Discovery CEO David Zazlav <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://deadline.com/2024/09/harry-potter-tv-series-max-release-date-cast-1235323284/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://deadline.com/2024/09/harry-potter-tv-series-max-release-date-cast-1235323284/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">confirmed earlier this year</a></span> that the plan was for the <em>Harry Potter </em>TV show to hit in 2026, with casting for main characters like Hermione Granger and Ron Weasley already underway. <em>Hogwarts Legacy 2</em>, meanwhile, seems unlikely to arrive until 2027 or 2028 at the earliest as big-budget games continue development timelines of 4-6 years and beyond. </p><p>The original game takes place in the 1890s, and while it’s not clear when a sequel would be set, it would likely be laying the groundwork for the particular flavor of <em>Hogwarts</em>’ history to be referenced in the TV remake, no doubt with Marvel-style easter eggs to pull fans from one to the other. </p><p>As for J.K. Rowling’s ongoing involvement in <em>Harry Potter</em>, Haddad said that while she is not directly involved in any planning related to the universe outside of the books, the controversy-courting YA author is still kept in the loop. “If we’re going to ever go beyond a canon conversation, we make sure that we’re all comfortable with what we’re doing,” Robert Oberschelp, Warner Bros. Discovery’s head of global consumer products, told <em>Variety</em>.

I mean this as a compliment. This short narrative game from developer Wrong Organ is an emotionally and mentally taxing game with a clear story to tell. It might not be the easiest game to get through at times due to its tough themes, but it’s remarkable nonetheless and stands out as one of this year’s best games.</p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="196646" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="Dragon’s Dogma 2’s New Class Is A Twirling Death Machine" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="137" data-playlist="196646,196215,196055" data-current="196646"><div><p>Dragon’s Dogma 2’s New Class Is A Twirling Death Machine</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196646/196646_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196646/196646_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196646/196646_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196646/196646_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/22202.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>Despite what <em>Mouthwashing</em>’s first sequence may suggest, this isn’t really a horror game that thrives on adrenaline pumping jump scares. After running through the twisting halls of a spaceship, chased by a horse mascot, the game turns into something much more surreal and narratively dense. You will be introduced to the five person crew of the freighter ship <em>Tulpar, </em>which has been stranded in space with no hope of rescue after the captain (Curly) nearly destroyed the ship in the midst of a mental breakdown. That leaves him and the four other crew members of the <em>Tulpar</em> left to deal with their own existential crises over the likelihood of their impending deaths. </p><p>This is, to say the least, a pretty big bummer of a plot. It’s also a set up for what becomes a surrealist trip through each crew member’s lives, hopes, and struggles. While the game loosely guides you through its walking simulator-esque structure, the writing sharply dissects each character and puts their insides on display for you. You’ll come to empathize with the nervous nurse Anya, the young intern Daisuke, and even the grouchy elder Swansea.</p><figure id="" data-id="ccae7fb1757c216bf5cc361aa128cb0a" data-recommend-id="image://ccae7fb1757c216bf5cc361aa128cb0a" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="720" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A woman sits at a table surrounded by mouthwash with on-screen text that reads &quot;Jimmy: You thinking about drinking that too?&quot;" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A woman sits at a table surrounded by mouthwash with on-screen text that reads &quot;Jimmy: You thinking about drinking that too?&quot;" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Critical Reflex</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="ccae7fb1757c216bf5cc361aa128cb0a" data-recommend-id="image://ccae7fb1757c216bf5cc361aa128cb0a" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="720" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A woman sits at a table surrounded by mouthwash with on-screen text that reads &quot;Jimmy: You thinking about drinking that too?&quot;" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>The two remaining crew members, Curly and Jimmy, will take up a majority of the game’s focus. Curly survives what appears to be a suicide attempt in the form of crashing the ship, but is now bedridden. Unable to speak or move, you interact with him only by giving him medicine. You do this in the shoes of JImmy, the co-pilot and current captain following the crash. Jimmy, at times, appears to be the only person on the <em>Tulpar</em> who still has some sanity. While the rest of the crew is coping with their imminent deaths in unique ways, Jimmy tries to hold the crew together. But <em>Mouthwashing </em>digs into Jimmy even further.</p><figure id="" data-id="afpvuwnfoibrncd6upmy" data-recommend-id="image://afpvuwnfoibrncd6upmy" data-format="png" data-width="800" data-height="88" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Spoiler warning graphic" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><span data-id="afpvuwnfoibrncd6upmy" data-recommend-id="image://afpvuwnfoibrncd6upmy" data-format="png" data-width="800" data-height="88" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Spoiler warning graphic" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>While not traditional horror, <em>Mouthwashing </em>still has hallmarks of psychological horror in its claustrophobic atmosphere and dark themes. In that way it evokes <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/silent-hill-2-remake-bloober-review-ps5-pc-horror-2024-1851665482&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/silent-hill-2-remake-bloober-review-ps5-pc-horror-2024-1851665482"><em>Silent Hill 2</em></a></span>. That comparison becomes even more apt when the truth about Jimmy becomes clear. Like <em>Silent Hill 2</em>’s James, Jimmy is not the hero he is made out to be. Rather, he is the root of the issues on board the <em>Tulpar</em>. By flashing between scenes prior to, during, and after the crash, <em>Mouthwashing </em>slowly reveals that Jimmy, not Curly, caused the crash in an attempt to kill the entire crew. This was in response to discovering Anya had become pregnant after he sexually assaulted her.</p><p>While Silent Hill 2 eventually forgives James for his crimes, and encourages the player to see him as a flawed but redeemable character, <em>Mouthwashing </em>takes no such approach with Jimmy. Despite living in his mind for the majority of the game, Jimmy is shown to be a disease amongst the crew who, even in his final moments, cannot take responsibility for his actions. As the game progresses, the slowly decaying state of the <em>Tulpar </em>and its crew members act as a reflection of Jimmy’s decaying mental state, which is further illustrated by the story’s structure becoming fractured and twisted as you progress. By <em>Mouthwashing</em>’s end, there is nothing that seems to be based in reality about Jimmy’s existence on the <em>Tulpar</em>. He cannot live with the reality of his actions.</p><hr><p>In a year of great games, many of them lengthy AAA RPGs that will take you dozens of hours to beat, <em>Mouthwashing </em>is a short but highly impactful title that you shouldn’t miss.</p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

There are plenty of criticisms to levy at the fourth entry to BioWare’s fantasy RPG series, such as its lack of choice continuity from previous games and Whedon-esque quips sprinkled through its dialogue. And if you’re a CRPG diehard, you’re probably not too thrilled by it pivoting hard into an action RPG. But most of the time, these criticisms are buried under (or wielded by) people who are being pretty blatant that their real issue is that <em>The Veilguard </em>features queer characters who are actively presenting as such. To which, I have to ask, have you played a <em>Dragon Age</em> game? If you think this is a sudden pivot, I’m doubtful we played the same games.</p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="196742" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="What Is Dragonsplague?

Even the attempts to intellectualize such criticism via claims that its “ahistorical” to include modern-day terminology like “non-binary” in a fantasy setting falls apart: <em>Dragon Age</em> is an entirely fictional universe with flying lizards and people with horns. Is there perhaps a discussion to be had about how the story of Taash, the non-binary Qunari party member who is figuring out their identity, was handled? Sure, but I think it’s probably queer people that are trying to have that conversation, rather than the ones who are calling it “woke” and dogpiling on queer people who so much as mention <em>The Veilguard </em>on social media.</p><figure id="" data-id="ec6f81203b3f011d40a3c4220cd6eaa8" data-recommend-id="image://ec6f81203b3f011d40a3c4220cd6eaa8" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Rook and Davrin talk on a couch." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Rook and Davrin talk on a couch." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->BioWare / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="ec6f81203b3f011d40a3c4220cd6eaa8" data-recommend-id="image://ec6f81203b3f011d40a3c4220cd6eaa8" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Rook and Davrin talk on a couch." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>But what I do want to address is the revisionist history that <em>Dragon Age </em>wasn’t always writing stories that not only included queer characters but actively engaged with their storylines in a way that built out the world of Thedas. The first game, <em>Dragon Age: Origins</em>, included two same-sex romance options in Leliana and Zevran, with both acting as conduits through which we learned about the intersections of sex, religion, and gender as early as 2009. <em>Dragon Age II</em> is one of the most prolific examples of the <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/video-game-romance-playersexual-baldurs-gate-dragon-age-1851253394&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/video-game-romance-playersexual-baldurs-gate-dragon-age-1851253394">“playersexual” romance</a></span> that makes all its romance options bisexual. <em>Dragon Age: Inquisition</em> has an entire questline about a gay man nearly being subjected to a magical form of conversion therapy, while also including the series’ first exclusively gay companions and a prominent trans side character. Each of these games has progressively included queer characters and, perhaps even more notably, queer struggle within its world. Having a trans party member and the ability to <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/dragon-age-veilguard-trans-choice-rook-gender-pronouns-1851682607&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/dragon-age-veilguard-trans-choice-rook-gender-pronouns-1851682607">confirm your protagonist is trans</a></span> is the natural progression of a series that has only gotten more queer as the real world has.</p><p>That progression of visibly queer characters and storylines has been in the face of years of pushback from prejudiced criticism. A lot of this came from people who claimed to be fans often believing that queer people getting roleplaying options were somehow taking away from straight people. This perspective ignores the fact that BioWare’s franchise has aspired to create an equal playing field for its queer players for years. BioWare even <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/dragon-age-ii-writer-eloquently-defends-the-games-sexua-5785306&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/dragon-age-ii-writer-eloquently-defends-the-games-sexua-5785306">responded to that line of thinking</a></span>, saying <em>Dragon Age II</em>’s free-for-all romances “are not for ‘the straight male gamer’. They’re for everyone.” <em>Dragon Age </em>is no stranger to queerness, but it’s no stranger to controversy surrounding it, either. Many of us who have been around BioWare’s orbit for decades have seen the way bigots have expressed faux concern as a thinly-veiled effort to strip <em>Dragon Age</em> of its queer legacy.</p><p>It’s funny to watch scenes like the above, in which Iron Bull has a frank discussion with Krem, a trans man, about how trans people are viewed in Qunari culture in the world of <em>Dragon Age</em>, knowing that <em>The Veilguard </em>would be having a trans Qunari wrestling with those questions themself. It doesn’t attempt to muddy the reality of what it’s talking about and even gives you a good slap on the wrist if you try to misgender Krem through your dialogue choices. It’s no less overt than what <em>The Veilguard</em> does. So what’s different now, 10 years later? The answer is not <em>Dragon Age</em>. In a way, it’s not angry bigots online, either. It’s the way the internet has allowed entire businesses to thrive on faux outrage by painting a video game as a boogeyman worth mobilizing against.</p><p><em>Dragon Age: The Veilguard </em>hasn’t even been out a week and it’s become such a minefield to talk about. As people who weren’t even going to play the game in the first place make it a battleground, it’s got fans of the series so resistant to criticism for fear that it will become ammunition for hateful people to use against it.</p><figure id="" data-id="65301cdb411d3698ae17568a839af85c" data-recommend-id="image://65301cdb411d3698ae17568a839af85c" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Rook sits with Taash and their mother at a dinner table." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Rook sits with Taash and their mother at a dinner table." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->BioWare / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="65301cdb411d3698ae17568a839af85c" data-recommend-id="image://65301cdb411d3698ae17568a839af85c" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Rook sits with Taash and their mother at a dinner table." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://aftermath.site/aftermath-hours-podcast-dragon-age-veilguard-review-controversy&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://aftermath.site/aftermath-hours-podcast-dragon-age-veilguard-review-controversy" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The internet is broken</a></span>, and when it feels like we have no power to fight about anything else, people resort to fighting about a video game like it’s activism. Those problems extend far beyond BioWare’s latest, but let’s not pretend the criticisms that <em>Dragon Age</em> “wasn’t like this before” are anything other than what they are. If you think <em>The Veilguard</em>’s portrayal of a non-binary character finding who they are, a protagonist capable of being explicitly trans, and a party of queer characters who are smooching between missions is in any way “new” for the franchise, you haven’t been paying attention.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

One of them is <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/PTCGP/comments/1gfmv96/wonder_pick_guide/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/PTCGP/comments/1gfmv96/wonder_pick_guide/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">prioritizing Wonder picks</a></span> with 2-star cards, which provide the best overall value when it comes to possible outcomes. Another is only using points to purchase the rarest cards you’re least likely to get just by opening packs. But mostly it’s just a waiting game since the bulk of <em>Pokémon TCG Pocket</em> is governed by RNG and stamina meters. </p><p>I personally have clearly torpedoed my odds of getting a complete Genetic Apex set anytime soon, since instead of maximizing my chances of getting cards I don’t have, I’ve been focusing on getting Charizards, Mewtoos, and legendary birds Moltres and Articuno in order to wreck people in random battles. The rewards for winning are minuscule, but it’s a great way to kill time in-between waiting for my next booster pack to be ready. </p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

The chances are, if you’re among them, the massive amount of content and currencies can be a bit overwhelming, especially if you don’t have any previous experience with the series or other free-to-play games. This guide will explain everything you need to know about <em>Pokémon TCG Pocket.</em></p><h2 id="h91904"><a id=""></a><strong>What is <em>Pokémon TCG Pocket?</em></strong></h2><figure id="" data-id="89391669c744d9d46396528c3c02c663" data-recommend-id="image://89391669c744d9d46396528c3c02c663" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Packs to open in PTCG Pocket." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Packs to open in PTCG Pocket." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->The Pokémon Company / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="89391669c744d9d46396528c3c02c663" data-recommend-id="image://89391669c744d9d46396528c3c02c663" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Packs to open in PTCG Pocket." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>As the name implies, <em>Pokémon TCG Pocket </em>is a free-to-play mobile version of the <em>Pokémon TCG</em> and is available on iOS and Android. The app offers a lighter simulation of the excitement of the physical game, letting you open up booster packs, add them to your “binder,” and use those cards to build decks and battle other players or the computer. Much like the real TCG, you can choose to approach it as you prefer, whether that’s by collecting all the cards to admire the stellar artwork, or to create a brutal arsenal of <em>Pokémon </em>that will crush other players online.</p><p>You can also engage in different missions that provide rewards upon completion. Some of them can be fairly simple, such as opening a pack, while others could require you to collect specific cards or register a set number in the Card Dex—basically the record of your collection. Most of these will be completed just by playing the game, but you do need to remember to go into the Mission Menu to collect your rewards.</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="1ed7ae4b689c6d7a634f800183d1a917" data-recommend-id="image://1ed7ae4b689c6d7a634f800183d1a917" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="The Dex Missions list." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="The Dex Missions list." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->The Pokémon Company / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="1ed7ae4b689c6d7a634f800183d1a917" data-recommend-id="image://1ed7ae4b689c6d7a634f800183d1a917" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="The Dex Missions list." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>Much like the real world, you get more cards by opening booster packs. However, unlike their physical counterparts which contain ten cards, <em>Pokémon TCG Pocket </em>boosters (like those gained through code cards in <em>Pokémon TCG Live</em>) only contain five. The launch set is called Genetic Apex, with three different booster pack arts, Pikachu, Charizard and Mewtwo. These three types each have some specific cards unique to them: for example, if you want the Pikachu ex card, it’s only available in the Pikachu pack.</p><p>If there’s a particular card you’re looking for, make sure you are opening the correct type of pack. The card list for each, as well as their percentage chance of being pulled, can be viewed by tapping the “Offering Rates” Button in the left corner.</p><p>Of course, you can’t just open as many packs as you want. You need to make sure you have enough Pack Stamina, which refills automatically on a timer. Every 12 hours, the bar refills, allowing you to open up another pack. For those bad at math, this means you can open two packs a day, receiving only ten new cards a day. Fortunately, the game has some ways to speed up this timer, as well as other methods to get new cards, like the Wonder Pick.</p><p>The Wonder Pick is basically a roulette where you can select one random card from a pack that another player has opened. Don’t worry, you aren’t stealing from them, you are just getting a chance to get the same card they pulled. Depending on the rarity of the cards in their booster, it could cost up to three Wonder Stamina, which also refills on a timer. Wonder Pick can be a great way to get a specific card, but given the randomized nature of what you get, it can be frustrating spending three Wonder Stamina trying to get a full-art or EX card, only to get a garbage common one. Still, the option is there, so you might as well use it, especially once you start filling out your collection and need incredibly specific cards to complete it.</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="54093d3561b3a6fc6ab168bc5f3b37d1" data-recommend-id="image://54093d3561b3a6fc6ab168bc5f3b37d1" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="The My Cards screen." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="The My Cards screen." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->The Pokémon Company / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="54093d3561b3a6fc6ab168bc5f3b37d1" data-recommend-id="image://54093d3561b3a6fc6ab168bc5f3b37d1" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="The My Cards screen." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>When you open a pack, your cards are automatically added to the “My Cards” section, which can be viewed by pressing the second button from the left on the bottom of the screen. From here, you can create specific binders to show off cards from your collection, or build a display board to highlight a favorite card. This section also lets you add “Flair” to individual cards, which is just a cosmetic effect such as sparkles or bubbles, by consuming duplicates and Shine Dust. If you are having trouble adding flair to a card you have multiples of, make sure you have the correct quantity of copies of the card and ensure you will still have at least two remaining after the flair is purchased. Also note that Shine Dust is only used to add flair, so don’t worry about hoarding it.</p><p>By pressing a tab near the top of the screen, you can also toggle between recently added cards and their quantities, or have the cards organized by their placement in the expansion. The former is useful in quickly searching if you have enough duplicates to add flair, while the latter can be incredibly helpful in determining what is needed to fill holes in your collection.</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="83f37efad4790fe5d69562cf474a240c" data-recommend-id="image://83f37efad4790fe5d69562cf474a240c" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="The Premium Pass screen." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="The Premium Pass screen." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->The Pokémon Company / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="83f37efad4790fe5d69562cf474a240c" data-recommend-id="image://83f37efad4790fe5d69562cf474a240c" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="The Premium Pass screen." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>One of the many ways to spend money in <em>Pokémon TCG Pocket </em>is the Premium Pass subscription. This gives you access to an additional Stamina bar that refills every 24 hours, allowing one more pack to be opened per day. You will also gain access to Premium Missions that offer a unique currency called “Premium Tickets,” used for special rewards and cosmetics such as promo cards, or battle cosmetics like coins and sleeves. It costs $9.99 per month, which is a little steep for what you get, but there is a two-week free trial if you want to try to complete all the missions to snatch up the first set of redeemables, which are Mewtwo themed.</p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="e981e3a5455dd7aea234cab3688ecc49" data-recommend-id="image://e981e3a5455dd7aea234cab3688ecc49" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="The various hourglasses you can get in the game." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="The various hourglasses you can get in the game." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->The Pokémon Company / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="e981e3a5455dd7aea234cab3688ecc49" data-recommend-id="image://e981e3a5455dd7aea234cab3688ecc49" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="The various hourglasses you can get in the game." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>By playing the game and completing missions, you will probably notice you’re obtaining at least two types of hourglass items: Pack Hourglasses and Wonder Hourglasses. Both of these are consumables that can be used to refill their respective Stamina bar by one hour. For example, if you just opened a booster pack, you can use 12 Pack Hourglasses to immediately open another one.</p><p>You will gain these items by completing daily missions, or by leveling up, but you can also purchase them in the Shop by using a whole different type of currency called “Shop Tickets.” These are gained by completing the game’s “Step Up Battles,” which are <em>TCG Pocket’s</em> Computer Controlled fights, by completing Event Missions, and from gifts sent by other players after you’ve battled or Wonder Picked with them. It may be tempting to hoard your Hourglasses, but they can only be used to open packs, so don’t feel bad about using them to do so. Though, if you do save up 120 Pack Hourglasses, you can open ten packs at once which is a very cool experience.</p><p>When you first start the game, it’ll throw buckets of hourglasses at you, until you get very used to having them. Then it rather sharply reduces that rate, while nudging that you could always buy some more, so be careful not to get sucked into the sense that they’ll keep on flowing.</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="71007cebf26571e5ac9d84c03f1b4fa8" data-recommend-id="image://71007cebf26571e5ac9d84c03f1b4fa8" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="The Poke Gold shop screen." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="The Poke Gold shop screen." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->The Pokémon Company / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="71007cebf26571e5ac9d84c03f1b4fa8" data-recommend-id="image://71007cebf26571e5ac9d84c03f1b4fa8" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="The Poke Gold shop screen." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>It wouldn’t be a free-to-play game without a premium currency, so of course <em>Pokémon TCG Pocket </em>has one of those. Among many other ways to spend it, the creatively named Poké Gold can be used to speed up your Stamina bar if you find yourself short on hourglasses. You can use a combination of both Gold and hourglasses, and the game will automatically apply the most efficient usage of both. There is also currently bonus gold for buying the $1, $5 and $10 packages, but note these bonuses can only be used for each increment once.</p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="1563994953f600df48613bfed8a59aca" data-recommend-id="image://1563994953f600df48613bfed8a59aca" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="A screenshot of some of the Shop screen." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A screenshot of some of the Shop screen." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->The Pokémon Company / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="1563994953f600df48613bfed8a59aca" data-recommend-id="image://1563994953f600df48613bfed8a59aca" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="A screenshot of some of the Shop screen." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>Yes, there are more currencies. Mentioned briefly above, Shop Tickets are obtained by completing different missions or battles, and can be redeemed to buy item cards, different cosmetics, or hourglasses. These are probably the most versatile currency in the game, so they should be used on whatever you prefer. There are also Emblem Tickets which are awarded by completing Dex milestones, such as registering a set number of cards, and can<em>&nbsp;</em>be<em>&nbsp;</em>used to buy Emblems from the Store. Emblems are just badges you can apply to your profile, and don’t really have any impact on the game. Right now, the options are Pikachu, Charizard and Mewtwo, so if you have enough, just use it on whatever monster is your favorite of those. There are also Special Shop Tickets which can be gathered by spending regular Shop tickets, or consuming high-rarity cards. These let you purchase Special Series cosmetics such as coins and playmats, though they aren’t too exciting.</p><hr><p>For a game about collecting cards, <em>Pokémon TCG Pocket </em>complicates this simple hobby by including an obscene amount of currencies and cosmetics that may leave you with a headache even Psyduck could’t handle. While it is a lot to take in at first, most of these currencies can only be used on a specific aspect of the game—such as hourglasses—so you don’t need to worry about spending it on the “wrong” thing. Just play the game however you want, and good luck collecting ‘em all.</p><p>.</p></div></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
