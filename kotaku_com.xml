              <p><span>For one night in 2005, the Mojave Desert glowed green. Microsoft inexplicably launched its then-new console, the Xbox 360, with a release event in a hangar in the desert. A Microsoft executive told Gizmodo in 2005 </span><a href="https://gizmodo.com/xbox-360-zero-hour-burning-man-as-interpreted-by-micro-138815"><span>that it was supposed to resemble Burning Man</span></a><span>, the art festival where Silicon Valley’s rich reenact the prelude to a </span><i><span>BioShock</span></i><span> game.. Another executive called it an “</span><a href="https://mashable.com/article/xbox-360-launch-event-zero-hour-photos"><span>Xbox 360 oasis</span><span>.</span></a><span>” Journalists and Xbox fans—it was both a press event and a player launch party—lounged on beanbags to play the hottest new console at one of dozens of stations. Microsoft served alcohol from paneled domes that are now synonymous with </span><a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2020/12/31/950178368/yurts-igloos-and-pop-up-domes-how-safe-is-outside-restaurant-dining-this-winter"><span>covid-era outdoor dining</span></a><span>.</span></p> <p><span>These sorts of big budget gaming events, where companies spared no expense on luring press and fans into weird places—all in the name of promoting new hardware or games—don’t exist much anymore. But 20 years later, an artifact channeling that bygone era has reemerged, once again, this time in the Colorado desert: a </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/geoff-keighley-desert-statue-tga-diablo-4-2000649133"><span>mysterious demonic statue</span></a><span> with the bodies of the damned etched into its sides.</span></p>

 <h2>The Game Awards’ portal to hell</h2> <p><span>The Game Awards overseer Geoff Keighley posted a photo of the mysterious statue with a </span><a href="https://what3words.com/regal.inspiring.thickness"><span>geocode pointing people to an area of Joshua Tree National Park</span></a><span>, just off of Yucca Mesa Road. Tendrils glow red from the statue at night, illuminating the screaming skeletons of both humans and creatures. Several people who’ve visited the statue have posted about it on social media and Reddit. Apparently, a security guard watches over the relic—”cool dude,” </span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/1pcvnhp/so_i_got_to_visit_the_statue/"><span>according to Reddit user TautSexyElfKing</span></a><span>—and the statue makes sounds. Another person instructed others to knock on the door, saying something else will knock back.</span></p>

 <p><span>“It was very ambient and hellish sounding,” TautSexyElfKing said. “Almost like it was a doorway and on the other side was a large cavern with demons lurking about the other side. Maybe some light growling-ish sounds. There wasn’t anything I could make out in particular that would be a hint or anything”</span></p>

 <p><span>To the unaware, it looks like the kind of thing you might find at Burning Man, or maybe an altar for worshipping the devil. But Keighley’s post is a signal to gamers that this is an Easter egg—a marketing stunt. It’s working, not because it’s hyping people up for any specific game or console, but because it’s pushing people toward Keighley’s pride and joy: an end of year bash produced, owned, and hosted by the man himself.</span></p>

 <p><span>The statue itself is ambiguous enough that spectators can map it onto whatever’s at the top of their Game Awards World Premier wishlist. It’s off Yucca Mesa Road, so it must be for </span><i><span>Half-Life 3</span></i><span>. The demonic symbols are an obvious reference to </span><i><span>Diablo 4</span></i><span>‘s next expansion. No, wait—</span><a href="https://x.com/BT_BlackThunder/status/1994865924206452744"><span>maybe that’s </span><i><span>God of War</span></i></a><span>. It’s essentially a hell portal, which clearly means </span><i><span>Doom</span></i><span>. I don’t know, maybe </span><i><span>Elder Scrolls 6</span></i><span>? Or, perhaps, </span><a href="https://x.com/NoMansSky/status/1995954970626326556"><span>Keighley is simply himself opening a portal to hell</span></a><span> and </span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/1pdt9n9/what_if_its_not_teasing_a_game_at_all_and_geoff/"><span>intends to destroy the whole dang world</span></a><span>.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">no one is considering that Geoff is simply opening a hell portal <a href="https://t.co/XKEgj6N3e6">https://t.co/XKEgj6N3e6</a></p> <p>— Sean Murray (@NoMansSky) <a href="https://twitter.com/NoMansSky/status/1995954970626326556?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 2, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <p><span>Apparently everyone is wrong, </span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/PS5/comments/1pcf4dp/jason_schreier_says_that_the_game_awards_statue/"><span>according to</span><i><span> Bloomberg</span></i><span> reporter Jason Schreier</span></a><span>, who said it’s not </span><i><span>Diablo 4</span></i><span> or </span><i><span>Elder Scrolls 6</span></i><span>. “</span><span>I don’t currently plan on reporting what it is, sorry, but it’s a good one,” he wrote </span><a href="https://www.resetera.com/threads/geoff-keighley-posts-cryptic-image-with-the-caption-regal-inspiring-thickness-up-not-diablo-up2-new-message-from-tga-account.1368046/page-7#post-148323163"><span>on a gaming forum</span></a><span>. </span><span>” Regardless of the answer, The Game Awards wins—the statue has gotten enough buzz that people will, certainly, tune in to see what the statue is teasing.</span></p>

 <p><span>It’s a little more easily digestible than, say, </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/the-two-year-mystery-is-over-this-is-frog-fractions-2-1790505179"><span>the </span><i><span>Frog Fractions 2</span></i><span> ARG</span></a><span> that went unsolved for literally two years spanning nearly two dozen games on Steam and a book in a California library. Then there’s the </span><i><span>Halo 2</span></i><span> ARG called I Love Bees, which spanned three months, jars of honey, and several pay phones,&nbsp; or when Electronic Arts launched copies of </span><i><span>Mass Effect 3 </span></i><span>into space using weather balloons. (</span><a href="https://kotaku.com/early-mass-effect-3-winners-may-have-jumped-into-legal-5888619"><span>The people who found the copies</span></a><span>, inevitably plummeting back to earth, could play the game early.)</span></p> <p><span>Keighley’s Game Awards statue doesn’t seem to necessarily be an alternate reality game. It’s hard to say if it’s really leaving any clues for gamers to decode or just there to power the hype cycle. It feels more aligned with the chaotic churn of algorithmic virality that everyone’s seeking these days—a weird thing in a weird place, easily photographed or videotaped and circulated on TikTok, Reddit, and elsewhere. </span><a href="https://www.tiktok.com/search?q=game%20awards%20statue&amp;t=1764954890852"><span>It’s working</span></a><span>.&nbsp;</span></p> <h2>The new AAA realty</h2> <p><span>Companies have done these sorts of things for highly-anticipated, big budget games like </span><a href="https://imgur.com/a/2GpQl"><i><span>Overwatch</span></i></a> <span>(big action figures in big boxes), </span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GodofWarRagnarok/comments/10p0i4x/giant_leviathan_axe_appeared_in_london/"><i><span>God of War</span></i></a><span> (big axe in London), and </span><a href="https://www.techradar.com/news/life-size-horizon-forbidden-west-clawstrider-statues-could-win-you-a-ps5"><i><span>Horizon Forbidden West</span></i></a><span> (big mechanical monsters). The difference, of course, is that it’s obvious what these installations were promoting. The danger in the Game Awards statue is that people will end up let down by whatever game it’s tied to.</span></p>

 <p><span>Events like The Game Awards were born to market AAA games; Keighley fills the show with commercials for the latest and greatest big-budget blockbusters from the industry’s mega-companies, backed by a booming voice boasting a world premiere announcement or new gameplay trailer. The biggest of these, games like </span><i><span>The Witcher 4</span></i><span> or </span><i><span>Marvel’s Wolverine</span></i><span>, barely need the extra eye-balls while everything else gets lost in the shuffle. Homegrown debut hits like </span><i><span>Balatro</span></i><span> and </span><i><span>Expedition 33: Clair Obscure</span></i><span>, meanwhile, come out of nowhere and dominate the zeitgeist without the help of giant marketing machines. While some companies hope to manufacture a fraction of that cachet with big showcase moments, it’s no longer obvious that they’re for sale. To hear some tell it, the old AAA gaming model has reached “</span><a href="https://www.thegamebusiness.com/p/the-man-who-signed-arc-raiders-the"><span>the end of days</span></a><span>.” We’re a long way from cosplaying Area 51 for a midnight console launch.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>But I suppose that’s not Keighley’s problem. People might not remember whatever the statue ends up being for but they’ll tune into The Game Award to find out. He gets to hype his show either way.</span></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/metroid-prime-4-beyond-graphics-comparison-switch-2-ugly-2000650585"><em>Metroid Prime 4: Beyond</em></a> technically isn’t the first Nintendo-published Switch 2 game to offer 120FPS support, but I don’t count that weird paid tech demo known as <a href="https://kotaku.com/switch-2-worst-games-nintendo-metacritic-drag-x-drive-welcome-tour-2000617517"><em>Switch 2 Welcome Tour</em></a> that launched with the system. No, <em>Prime 4</em> is Nintendo’s first 120FPS Switch 2 experience, and it’s amazing. It is also a bit odd coming from Nintendo, but it makes me really hope this is an option in future games from the <em>Mario</em> company.</p> <p>Out now on Switch 2 and the OG Switch, <a href="https://kotaku.com/metroid-prime-4-reviews-is-it-good-switch-2-nintendo-2000649621"><em>Metroid Prime 4: Beyond</em></a> is the next entry in the popular sci-fi shooter series that is itself a spin-off of the 2D <em>Metroid</em> games.<a href="https://kotaku.com/metroid-prime-4-impressions-first-level-volt-forge-titanfall-2-factory-2000650657"> And while I found the opening hour to be a bit meh</a>, the game really picks up once you reach Volt Forge. But one thing that was great and remained excellent from the very start was <em>Metroid Prime 4</em>‘s performance mode on Switch 2, which offers up 120 buttery smooth frames per second if your TV can handle it. Gunplay, platforming, driving, and even puzzle solving are just so much nicer at the higher framerate.</p>

 <p>And this isn’t some hidden mode. No, the moment you first boot up <em>Prime 4</em>, it asks you to select between two modes: a 4K/60FPS option and a 1080p/120FPS option. I’ve played the game both ways, and while the 60FPS option is great and looks a tad sharper, I’ve primarily played Prime 4 in the 120FPS mode because it feels so nice and smooth. At first, I was worried that the Switch 2 would struggle to maintain that high framerate. But in my hours with the game so far, I’ve only seen one or two dips, and that was only in the open world desert portions of <em>Prime 4.</em></p>

  <p>It’s tricky to share 120FPS videos on the internet. Even using YouTube is challenging, as the ability to watch 120FPS content depends on the video, your device, etc. So unfortunately, I can’t show you how good <em>Prime 4</em> looks running at a high framerate. <a href="https://www.digitalfoundry.net/news/2025/12/metroid-prime-4-is-switch-2s-first-true-120hz-3d-showcase">But trust me, it’s great and totally worth the small trade-off</a> of the image looking a little softer compared to the 4K/60FPS mode. And yeah, it’s weird to even be talking about modes like this in a Nintendo first-party release. I’m not upset about it at all, though, as I’ve long wanted Nintendo’s visuals and tech to catch up with the rest of the industry, and this is a big step in that direction.</p> <p>Now all I can do is think about how great it would be for the next mainline 3D <em>Mario</em> to offer a 120FPS mode. <a href="https://kotaku.com/let-us-all-remember-the-great-f-zero-gx-5920082">Can you imagine a new <em>F-Zero</em> running at 120FPS</a>? Or what about a <em>Smash Bros</em> sequel offering a high framerate mode? I know not all Nintendo-published games moving forward will support 120FPS, but I hope we get a few more every year as the company’s games often look and feel better than usual when you have all those extra frames.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Mortal Kombat, Hogwarts Legacy, And Batman: Arkham Are Going To A Company That Closed Its Only AAA Game Studio]]></title>
            <link>https://kotaku.com/netflix-wb-batman-arkham-hogwarts-legacy-mortal-kombat-2000650918</link>
            <guid>1374697</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Netflix is bidding <a href="https://kotaku.com/netflix-warner-bros-deal-batman-hbo-max-2000650875">over $80 billion to buy Warner Bros.</a>, and it’s probably not doing it for the games. But the company will still come away with a ton of them if the merger goes through. Warner Bros. Games is one of the few major publishers left in the U.S. following years of big acquisition deals. What might be closer to a rounding error relative to the larger movie and TV portfolio still marks a huge shift for the industry. And Netflix’s incredibly chaotic fumbling of gaming over the last several years raises some alarm bells.</p> <p>The king of streaming confirmed during a conference call presentation about the newly revealed deal that games would be part of the transaction, but <a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/yes-netflix-is-acquiring-warner-bros-games">never discussed them outright</a>. Instead, they were relegated to the smallest square on a presentation slide outlining the various components of the merger. They were lumped in with “Games &amp; Consumer Product &amp; Experiences” alongside much bigger brands like HBO, DC, Harry Potter, and Superman.</p>

 <figure id="attachment_2000650991" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000650991"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000650991">Netflix / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p>Even with its massive success, the best-selling game of 2023, <em>Hogwarts Legacy</em>, was clearly nowhere close to top-of-mind for Netflix co-CEOs Ted Sarandos and Greg Peters. The open-world wizarding game already has a sequel in development at Avalanche Software, and it’s supposed to have <a href="https://kotaku.com/hogwarts-legacy-2-hbo-harry-potter-tv-release-date-1851690168">some level of crossover</a> with the upcoming HBO <em>Harry Potter</em> reboot. The first <em>Hogwarts Legacy</em> sold over 30 million copies. In revenue terms at least, that puts it way ahead of the global box office for something like James Gunn’s first<em> Superman </em>movie.</p>

 <p>Then there’s TT Games, the UK-based maker of the recent hit <em>Lego Star Wars: The Skywalker Saga</em>. It announced a new adaptation of <em>Batman</em> earlier this year called <em>Lego Batman: The Legacy of the Dark Knight,</em> which acts as a best-of sizzle reel for the comic book hero’s peak movie moments <a href="https://kotaku.com/lego-batman-legacy-of-the-dark-knight-preview-arkham-2000633994">in an<em> Arkham</em>-style open world</a>. There’s no release date yet, but it seems likely to arrive sometime in 2026. If it’s anything like the <em>Skywalker Saga</em>, it’ll be another top-seller.</p>

 <p>Netflix will also become the new home of <em>Mortal Kombat</em>. While a new movie launches next year, fans have been waiting for NeatherRealms to return to the DC universe with <em>Injustice 3</em>. The studio <a href="https://x.com/MortalKombat/status/1926020816879206810">announced earlier this year</a> that it was done shipping new DLC for 2023’s <em>Mortal Kombat 1</em> and would switch to focusing on its “next project” instead. Unless Ed Boon’s team is quietly at work on a completely new cross-over fighting game, a return to the alternate DC universe where Superman is bad still seems like the safest bet.</p>

 <h2>The fate of Rocksteady Studios</h2> <p>After that, things at Warner Bros. Games start to get really messy, thanks to years of seemingly short-sighted and chaotic executive decisions. Rocksteady Studios, once the team behind premier blockbusters like <em>Batman: Arkham City</em> and<em> Batman: Arkham Knight,</em> has been licking its wounds after the dismal failure of last year’s live service spin-off,<em> Suicide Squad: Kill The Justice League</em>. <a href="https://kotaku.com/suicide-squad-hogwarts-legacy-rocksteady-arkham-1851522893">Encouraged by publisher leadership</a> despite misgivings from the studio floor, the multiplayer loot shooter lost over $200 million, <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-06-06/-suicide-squad-warner-bros-s-200-million-flop-haunts-the-gaming-industry">according to<em> Bloomberg</em></a>.</p>

 <p>The studio is reportedly back to focusing on the Arkham franchise that made it famous, but a new entry would still be years away during a time when AAA development is more expensive and precarious than ever. Earlier this year, Warner Bros. Games took an ax to many of its other studios, including <em>MultiVersus</em> maker Player First Games, WB San Diego, which was making a free-to-play AAA game, and Monolith Productions, which was working on a long-in-development adaptation of <em>Wonder Woman</em>. The latter had a storied history, including developing the <em>Middle-earth: Shadow of Mordor</em> series, but <a href="https://www.tweaktown.com/news/103578/full-backstory-revealed-on-why-wb-games-axed-monolith-productions/index.html">lost key leadership</a> after it was forced to pivot from a new IP to adapting <em>Wonder Woman</em>.</p>

 <p>All of this turmoil resulted in publishing head David Haddad being fired from Warner Bros. Games after a decade-plus tenure. The game division’s struggles may have also been compounded by whip-lash from above, amid Warner Bros. Discovery CEO David Zaslav’s ongoing whirlwind tour through the unraveling conglomerate. Despite casually trampling on marketing plans by <a href="https://www.polygon.com/23612615/mortal-kombat-12-announced-2023-release-date/">revealing projects early</a> during investor calls, Zaslav never seemed to be interested in providing Warner Bros. Games with a clear mission or mandate other than “help make stock price go up.”</p> <h2>The Netflix Gaming debacle</h2> <p>News of the sale might be more reassuring if Netflix management didn’t seem equally at a loss when it comes to games. The streamer snatched up a bunch of small studios, including notable indie darlings like<em> Oxenfree</em> maker Night School Studio and <em>Cozy Grove</em> maker Spry Fox over the years. It loaded up its mobile app with tons of critically-acclaimed games from<em> Hades</em> to <em>The Rise of the Golden Idol</em>. It sought big-name additions like the<em> GTA Trilogy Remastered</em>. It even plunged ahead with an AAA studio called Team Blue that pulled veterans from&nbsp;<em>Overwatch</em>,&nbsp;<em>Halo</em>, and&nbsp;<em>God of War</em>.</p> <p>But despite bundling top games with its standard subscription service, <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2023/10/23/netflix-takes-slow-approach-to-video-games.html">almost nobody played them</a>. It started abandoning indie game deals, cutting resources, and <a href="https://www.gamefile.news/p/netflix-team-blue-socal-studio">quietly shuttered</a> its AAA team last year. Just this week, <a href="https://www.gamefile.news/p/netflix-sells-game-studio-spry-fox">Netflix announced</a> it was selling off Spry Fox, which it bought only three years ago, though the ambitious 3D Studio-Ghibli-meets-<em>Animal-Crossing</em>-chillfest called <em>Spirit Crossing</em> will remain in development. Instead, the company’s big focus moving forward will be party games and quick-turn-around licensed junk for its biggest streaming hits like <em>Squid Games</em> and <em>Bridgerton</em>. It’s the latest example of a <a href="https://kotaku.com/netflix-squid-game-unleashed-app-subscription-team-blue-1851755122">tech company racing into gaming and falling flat on its face</a>.</p>

 <p>So where does that leave Warner Bros. Games and its checkered portfolio of major games and studios? It’s hard to say. In some ways, it complements all of the areas of gaming where Netflix has already failed or retreated. It may not be high up on the list of synergies, but maybe the possibility of an eventual <em>Lego Stranger Things</em> anthology is still part of the streaming platform’s overall ambitions for the merger. Or maybe gaming, and AAA blockbuster gaming in particular, is so peripheral to Netflix’s broader business that Warner Bros. Gaming will find itself in an even more precarious position.</p> <p>Giant acquisitions are rarely as neat and tidy in practice as they appear on paper or in a PowerPoint presentation, even in the best of times, let alone when they’re thrown together in the midst of bidding wars, tumultuous legacy media transformations, and a race toward industry consolidation in order to achieve monopoly pricing power. The only thing worse is the alternatives: <a href="https://www.wsj.com/business/media/i-wanna-blow-this-up-how-bari-weiss-is-trying-to-overhaul-cbs-news-7c222dcd?gaa_at=eafs&amp;gaa_n=AWEtsqf__sU79yafyMQJEMfHCSs4fmigQ3B1FDTDxd4VSdFIXnEqE9fLO4kOIFOfdrE%3D&amp;gaa_ts=693321bd&amp;gaa_sig=YVIiDhsSG8Saq0NhdsXVZfrJk7xIcIWtlf4iFEqprJZt9Q0pE5poRMAJo7dIKNvDDygD-VXenQ654oZeVxoqcQ%3D%3D">the Bari Weis network</a>, <a href="https://kotaku.com/xbox-microsoft-price-hike-game-pass-layoffs-new-console-2000638546">Microsoft</a>, or <a href="https://kotaku.com/ea-saudi-arabia-ownership-trump-jared-kushner-2000649726">Saudi Arabia</a> aren’t great options either.</p>

              <p><em><a href="https://kotaku.com/fnaf-2-five-nights-freddys-2-movie-trailer-teaser-foxy-1851786887">Five Nights at Freddy’s 2</a>,</em> out now in theaters, doesn’t sound like a good movie. And sure, the first film wasn’t a cinematic masterpiece, but according to critics, the sequel is even worse. It’s already one of 2025’s worst-rated movies, beating out some real stinkers.</p> <p><em>Five Nights at Freddy’s 2</em> is the follow-up to 2023’s <em>Five Nights at Freddy’s</em> and, like that movie, is a live-action adaptation of the popular horror game franchise that features a lot of evil animatronic figures and tons of confusing and bizarre lore. <a href="https://kotaku.com/five-nights-at-freddys-fnaf-movie-review-box-office-1850974086">The original film was a big hit at the box office</a>, but took a beating from critics and ended up with an abysmal <a href="https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/five_nights_at_freddys">33% on</a> <em>Rotten Tomatoes.</em> I bet Blumhouse and Universal would love for the newly released sequel to have that score. Instead, critics seem to hate this new entry even more, with <em>Freddy’s 2</em> sitting at a truly awful 12% on the review aggregate site. Ouch.</p>

 <p>Here’s what various critics think about this latest horror sequel:</p> <blockquote><p>“Clunky, overstuffed, and strangely lifeless, <em>Five Nights at Freddy’s 2</em> trades genuine scares for incoherent lore. Even the animatronics can’t save a sequel that feels more like brand maintenance than an actual movie.” – <strong>Dionar Hidalgo, <em>Algo Más Que Cine</em></strong></p> <p>“[Its] sole imperative appears to be boring its audience to death.” – <strong>Nick Schager, <em>The Daily Beast</em></strong></p> <p>“<em>Five Nights at Freddy’s 2</em> plays best for die-hard fans; for everyone else, it’s a stitched-together sequel with few scares and even fewer surprises.” – <strong>Allison Rose, <em>FlickDirect</em></strong></p> <p><em>“Five Nights at Freddy’s 2</em> is one of Blumhouse’s worst sequels, nothing more than a cynical cash grab that treats its audience and fanbase like mindless children.” -T<strong>yler Taing, <em>Discussing Film</em></strong></p></blockquote> <p><a href="https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/five_nights_at_freddys_2/reviews">And it goes on and on and on.</a> The consensus is that the movie is primarily designed to appeal to younger teens who are already obsessed with the franchise and will pick up on all the lore, Easter eggs, and secrets buried in the PG-13 horror flick. So it will likely make a lot of money, like the last one. But for everyone else, including people who like good movies, <em>Freddy’s 2</em> sounds like a bad time and one to avoid.</p>

 <p>Compared to some other stinkers released this year, <em>Five Nights at Freddy’s 2</em> is up there. It has a worse <a href="https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/star_trek_section_31">Rotten Tomatoes score than the awful <em>Star Trek</em> movie</a> we got this year, which most people thankfully don’t know about. <a href="https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/a_minecraft_movie">It also has a worse <em>RT</em> rating</a> than the <a href="https://kotaku.com/minecraft-movie-review-bad-jack-black-kids-movie-steve-1851775345">utterly awful Jack Black led <em>Minecraft</em> film</a>, which is wild. It even has a <a href="https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/disneys_snow_white">worse score</a> than <a href="https://kotaku.com/snow-white-seven-dwarfs-trailer-cgi-ugly-bad-disney-1851712570">Disney’s terrible <em>Snow White</em> remake</a>, which, yes, came out this year. Remember that movie? Probably not.</p> <p>Oh, and if you are wondering, no, according to <em>Rotten Tomatoes, Freddy’s 2</em> is better than the <em>Borderlands</em> movie. But just barely, as that disaster of a flick from Eli Roth has <a href="https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/borderlands">a 10% rating.</a> Better than <a href="https://kotaku.com/borderlands-movie-review-rotten-tomatoes-cast-release-1851616912"><em>Borderlands</em></a> isn’t much, but it is something to brag about, I guess?</p>
