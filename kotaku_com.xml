              <p data-start="0" data-end="878">If you work in photo or video editing, you already know that every extra bit of storage you can get your hands on feels like a lifesaver. Instead of deleting files you might eventually need, it’s almost always smarter to expand your storage capacity. That’s why compact external drives are so valuable. Stash away more data without taking up much space. And even though Black Friday has come and gone, that doesn’t mean you’ve missed your chance to snag a great deal on an external SSD. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6192/">Right now, the SanDisk 2TB Creator Pro Portable SSD is discounted on Amazon well after the next big shopping rush</a>. Usually listed at $294, this rugged yet tiny SSD is currently available for just $240, which is a solid 18% off. If 2TB isn’t quite the amount you’re after—too large or not quite enough—both the 1TB (6% off) and 4TB (7% off) models are marked down as well.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6192/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2 data-start="0" data-end="878">Fast Save and Load Times</h2>
<p data-start="880" data-end="1572">This small but powerful external SSD delivers remarkable performance considering its ultra-compact form factor. The “Creator Pro” branding is very intentional, signaling that it’s designed with professional creators in mind—those who rely on high-speed transfers to maintain their workflow. The SSD reaches impressive read speeds of 2,000 MB/s and write speeds of 2,000 MB/s, all while being only 2.5 inches in size. Small enough to fit in your pocket.</p>
<p data-start="1592" data-end="1907">The SSD also features a built-in carabiner loop. You can literally clip up to that’s 4,000GB of storage right onto your keychain. Attach it to your backpack, your belt loop, or anything else it can hook onto, and your files can travel anywhere with you while staying safely protected.</p>
<p data-start="1909" data-end="2332">Of course, having your data be this mobile might also raise concerns about losing it. Misplacing your bag at a café could mean someone suddenly has access to a massive chunk of your personal or professional files. Thankfully, you don’t have to worry. The drive includes password protection with 256-bit AES hardware encryption, ensuring that your information stays completely locked down. Only you can access what’s inside.</p>


<p data-start="2334" data-end="2604" data-is-last-node="" data-is-only-node=""><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6192/">Right now, you can save up to 18% on SanDisk’s portable SSD lineup for creators.</a> The 4TB version is discounted by 7% to $400, the 2TB version is 18% off at $240, and the 1TB model is 6% off at just $160. Come grab yours now before someone at SanDisk realizes Black Friday is over.</p>
<p data-start="2334" data-end="2604" data-is-last-node="" data-is-only-node="">For a limited time, you also receive a month free subscription to Adobe Creative Cloud. With this, you get access to Photoshop, Premiere, After Effects, Lightroom, and so many more applications that creators rely on.</p>
<p data-start="2334" data-end="2604" data-is-last-node="" data-is-only-node="">Be sure to check out the other offerings in the SanDisk Creator Pro lineup. Also available are a USB-C flash drive, an SSD desk drive, a microSD card, a phone drive, and a standard SD card. Not all are currently on sale, but they are all available in the same, stylish sky blue—so that’s something.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Good morning! Winter has hit my area of the country hard, and so I write this with cold fingers in a chilly basement office. Will I finally break down and turn on the heat? Stay tuned to find out. Anyway, my frozen digits and I welcome you to another edition of Morning Checkpoint, <em>Kotaku’s</em> daily round-up of video game news and other stuff you might care about. Today we’ve got more layoffs, bad news for some<em> Battlefield 6</em> players, creepy horror game <em>Horses</em> getting banned from another store, and more.</p> <h2><em>MLB The Show</em> is getting a mobile port</h2> <p>PlayStation’s long-running baseball sim series,<em> MLB The Show</em>, is arriving on a new platform: your mobile phone. Well, assuming you live in the Philippines, <a href="https://theshowmobile.com/">where the mobile port</a> is soft launching for a regional test.&nbsp; Meanwhile, PC players longing for a great baseball simulator watch on and shake their heads. Maybe one day, Sony and the MLB will remember to port <em>The Show</em> to computers.</p>

  <h2>Testing shows a <em>BF6</em> tank skin makes you take more damage</h2> <p><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Battlefield/comments/1pc1q3u/psa_do_not_use_the_mastery_50_ifv_or_mbt_skin_you/">A <em>Battlefield 6</em> player on Reddit posted a video that went viral</a> on the <em>BF6</em> subreddit. It shows that some tank and armored vehicle skins awarded to players who grind for hours are actually broken. Apparently, if you have these “Mastery” skins equipped, your vehicle will take more damage from RPGs and other explosives, making it much easier to destroy your tank. Yikes.</p>

 <p>A lot of players in the comments shared their own first-hand experiences using these skins and were happy to see this video seemingly proving that, no, they weren’t going mad, and in fact, their tanks were being blown up faster. Some players speculated that other vehicle skins in BF6 might have similar bugs and warned players from using any cosmetics on tanks until EA patches things up.</p>

 <h2>Eidos Montreal lays off staff for the second time in 2025</h2> <p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/eidos-montreal-lets-go-staff-more-layoffs-planned/">As first reported by <em>Insider Gaming</em></a> on December 2, a number of developers shared on LinkedIn that they had been fired in what appears to be a new round of layoffs at the studio behind <em>Guardians of the Galaxy</em> and <em>Deus Ex Human Revolution.&nbsp;</em> According to sources who spoke to the outlet, most of the studio’s internal projects have been canned, and what remains is now focused on supporting Xbox-published games like the upcoming <em>Fable</em> and recently released <em>Grounded 2</em>. This is the second round of layoffs this year to hit the Embracer-owned studio. In April, 75 employees were laid off at Edios Montreal.</p>

 <h2>A game studio fighting AI allegedly requires artists to draw during interviews</h2> <p><a href="https://automaton-media.com/en/news/mid-size-game-company-in-japan-asks-potential-recruits-to-draw-in-front-of-them-to-avoid-generative-ai-fraud/">As spotted by <em>Automaton</em>,</a> an anonymous graphic designer at a mid-sized game studio in Japan told a local outlet that after hiring artists who had used AI to get the job and discovering they lacked the skills the team needed, they are now allegedly testing artists during the hiring process. <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/a-japanese-game-studio-now-asks-art-applicants-to-draw-a-picture-during-the-interview-to-prove-they-dont-just-use-genai/">As translated by <em>VGC</em></a>, here’s what the dev said:</p>

 <p>“There are many people who claim that artwork generated by AI is their own creation. We’ve actually ended up hiring such people, only to find they weren’t productive, which led to several problems. Because of that, we’ve changed our hiring process and it now requires candidates to draw something in person during the interview to verify their skills. As a recruiter, it’s a huge hassle, and it feels like we’re going backwards in time, but I’ve heard that several other companies are doing the same thing.”</p> <h2><em>Horses</em> has now been banned from another storefront</h2> <p>On December 3, <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/horses-the-upsetting-horror-game-previously-banned-on-steam-gets-last-minute-ban-from-epic-games-store-too"><em>IGN</em> reported</a> that Horses is now banned from being sold on Humble. This is the third storefront to ban the controversial horror game, following Steam and Epic’s refusal to allow it to be sold on either platform. Horses is out now on GOG, for now at least.</p> <h2>ICYMI:</h2> <ul> <li><a href="https://kotaku.com/ea-saudi-arabia-ownership-trump-jared-kushner-2000649726">Saudi Arabia is going to own almost all of EA after the deal closes</a></li> <li><a href="https://kotaku.com/skate-season-2-update-skin-tone-changes-tired-stoners-character-changes-2000649710"><em>Skate 4</em> update makes everybody look more tired and stoned</a></li> <li><a href="https://kotaku.com/amazon-ai-generated-english-dub-banana-fish-reaction-2000649707">Amazon has removed that terrible AI-generated anime dub</a></li> </ul> <h2>Watch This:</h2>

            <title><![CDATA[No Many’s Sky Dev Jokes About Once Human Allegedly Stealing Their Assets]]></title>
            <link>https://kotaku.com/no-mans-sky-hello-games-once-human-teleporter-2000650107</link>
            <guid>1371721</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Earlier this week, a post on the official <i>No Man’s Sky</i> subreddit highlighted what clearly looks like some digital theft. Some premium cosmetics sold via a loot box in the free-to-play survival game <i>Once Human</i> look virtually identical to teleporters in space exploration game <i>No Man’s Sky</i>.</p> <p>While a circular object that can teleport someone has been a staple of science fiction since at least the film <i>Stargate</i>, the more you look at these two 3D assets, the more similarities you’ll spot; they’re virtually indistinguishable save for a different color theme. Managing director for <i>NMS </i>dev Hello Games, Sean Murray, was one of the many internet denizens who took note (<a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/survival/no-mans-sky-lead-responds-to-reports-of-stolen-assets-in-fellow-open-world-survival-game-once-human-says-the-jokes-on-them-because-theyre-actually-unfinished/">h/t <i>GamesRadar</i></a>). Though instead of expressing outrage, he’s taken a more playful approach, pointing out an oversight in the original design.</p>

 <p>“Jokes on them” <a href="https://x.com/NoMansSky/status/1995953990958547164?s=20">Murray wrote on X</a>, “we forgot to LOD those rivets 😅”</p> <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">jokes on them – we forgot to LOD those rivets 😅 <a href="https://t.co/XYvgdFXLas">https://t.co/XYvgdFXLas</a> <a href="https://t.co/KXRD3F5X1i">pic.twitter.com/KXRD3F5X1i</a></p> <p>— Sean Murray (@NoMansSky) <a href="https://twitter.com/NoMansSky/status/1995953990958547164?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 2, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <p>So if the assets are indeed ripped from <i>No Man’s Sky</i>, it will come with some very unoptimized geometry for <i>Once Human</i> to wrestle with.</p>

 <h2>The heck is a LOD?</h2> <p>“LOD” stands for “<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Level_of_detail_(computer_graphics)">level of detail</a>.” Various objects in any given 3D game will have different LODs depending on how far away from the object a viewer is. The further you are, the less detail there is on the object. This aids in rendering and stress on the machine producing the geometry. There’s no sense in having a fully detailed 3D object if you’re many miles away. Here’s <a href="https://youtu.be/w0bKkGqV5JQ">a video demonstrating the technique</a> in <i>Breath of the Wild</i>:</p>

  <p>So next time you’re playing a massive open-world game, now you know why objects look a little funny from a vast distance—especially if you’re playing <i>Once Human</i> and looking at some allegedly stolen assets.</p>

 <p><b><i>Updated; 12/3/2025, 11:20 a.m. ET:</i></b></p> <h2><em>Once Human</em> devs removing the asset, conducting a ‘thorough review’</h2> <p>In <a href="https://www.pcgamesn.com/once-human/no-mans-sky-asset-accusation">a statement to <i>PCGamesN</i></a>, <i>Once Human</i>’s devs stated they are taking the allegations “very seriously and want everyone to feel confident in the creative work that goes into the game.” They continued:</p> <blockquote><p>With this in mind, we will replace the asset in question. We are undertaking a thorough review and will be using this moment to strengthen our internal art and design policies. We genuinely appreciate the community members who brought this to our attention. This feedback helps us improve.</p></blockquote> <p>As <i>PCGamesN</i> notes, <i>Once Human</i> has been accused of using assets based on other games before, such as Caveira’s symbol from <i>Rainbow Six Siege</i>. Maybe they’ve finally learned their lesson now?</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/where-winds-meet-ai-npc-llm-chatgpt-steam-2000650074</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Whether we wanted it or not, we’ve stepped into a world where AI is increasingly sneaking into our games. Free-to-play multiplayer Steam hit <i>Where Winds Meet</i> is one of the latest examples, using an LLM-based chatbot for many of its NPCs that players can talk with. Or flirt with. Or “socially” engineer into completing quests without actually doing the work by talking to them like Solid Snake.</p> <p><b>Read More:</b> <a href="https://kotaku.com/arc-raiders-leaper-kill-spaceport-trials-into-the-fray-2000649665">Open-World RPG <i>Where Winds Meet</i> Has It All: Evil Geese, AI Chatbots, And A $40,000 Skin</a></p> <p>Developed by Chinese-based Everstone Studio, <i>Where Winds Meet</i> is a veritable Mulligan stew of countless modern gaming conventions, as well as AI NPCs that trade scripted, canned lines of dialogue for, in theory anyway, a more dynamic and unpredictable experience. Others might describe it as lifeless. I’m inclined to agree, but the tech isn’t without its amusing quirks and exploits. One such player seems to have proven this by flirting with the tech until it…well, it did something <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/wherewindsmeet_/comments/1pd0pgi/removed_by_moderator/?embed_host_url=https://www.thegamer.com/where-winds-meet-ai-npc-flirting-reply/">raunchy enough for a Reddit mod to take it down</a> (<a href="https://www.thegamer.com/where-winds-meet-ai-npc-flirting-reply/">h/t <i>The Gamer</i></a>).</p> <p>Though the screenshot taken by Reddit user Oglokes24 is now in horny jail, we can glean some context clues from the comments. The flirting seemed to involve Okglokes24 lying to an NPC to say that “her husband died” and, well, whatever it was, one user replied: “You should be locked up.” “Sex minigame when?” reads another comment. “Ban incoming,” states another.</p> <p><i>Kotaku</i> has reached out to Oglokes24 about the contents of the now-deleted screenshot.</p> <h2>AI…Chatbots?</h2> <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/chatgpt-ai-discord-clyde-chatbot-exploit-jailbreak-1850352678">Since LLMs hit the web</a>, folks have been finding all sorts of ways to trick them into doing things they’re not supposed to. Insert that tech into a game, and it’s no surprise that people are finding ways to get it to do things it’s not really supposed to. That includes some clever players realizing that if you talk to <i>Where Winds Meet</i>’s AI chatbots as Solid Snake would, by restating various phrases back to the NPC as a question, you can bypass certain quest win conditions.</p> <p>In a Reddit post documenting the so-called “<i>Metal Gear</i> method” (<a href="https://www.pcgamesn.com/where-winds-meet/npc-chatbots-gaming">h/t <i>PCGamesN</i></a>), a user was able to end a quest just by rephrasing everything the NPC said back as a question.</p> <figure id="attachment_2000650075" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000650075"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000650075">© Screenshot: Everstone Studio / Hakkix</figcaption></figure> <p>Based on comments from other players, the tech behind these pseudo-sentient NPCs isn’t as sophisticated as something like ChatGPT, so it’s a bit easier to find ways to screw with it. While I admit the prospect of interacting with NPCs via natural language is neat, I certainly am unwilling to trade thoughtful, well-written characters for this junk.</p>
