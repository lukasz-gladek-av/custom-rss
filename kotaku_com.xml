              <p>Robot vacuums range from basic bump-and-go models that randomly wander your floors to sophisticated machines that map your home with surgical precision, and Roborock always positioned itself at the premium end with innovations that justify higher price tags. Each new model brings features that push the category forward, but that innovation typically costs serious money, with the flagship Saros 10R normally demanding $1,599 from your wallet.</p>
<p>The great news is that <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5750/">Amazon’s Black Friday deal slashes $600 off that price to bring it down to $999 (38% off)</a> hitting an all-time low that makes this ultra-premium cleaner actually accessible instead of just aspirational. This discount transforms the most advanced robot vacuum on the market into something you can justify buying, and once it starts handling your cleaning routine, you’ll wonder how you ever tolerated doing floors manually.</p>

<h2>Engineering That Solves Real Cleaning Problems</h2>
<p>The <strong>ultra-slim 3.14-inch profile lets this robot slip under furniture</strong> that standard vacuums can’t reach, thanks to the StarSight Autonomous System 2.0 that eliminates the raised LDS dome making most robot vacuums too tall for low-clearance spaces. You get cleaning coverage under beds, sofas, and cabinets where dust bunnies normally live undisturbed for months because your regular vacuum can’t fit.</p>
<p><strong>3D sensing technology maps your home with precision</strong>, even in tight spaces under narrow-legged furniture, while the VertiBeam system navigates around cables without getting stuck or needing you to pre-clean your floors before the robot can do its job. Improved algorithms recognize and adapt to 108 different obstacle types, so it handles everything from pet toys to chair legs without calling for help every five minutes.</p>



<p>The <strong>22,000 Pa HyperForce suction pulls dirt, pet hair, and debris</strong> from hardwood, tile, and carpets with enough power to handle embedded mess that weaker vacuums just push around. Combined, the <span>Zero-Tangling DuoDivide</span> main brush and anti-tangle omnidirectional wheels mean you never spend ten minutes cutting hair wraps off the roller bar-which, if you have long hair or pets, is basically the worst part of owning robot vacuums. The <strong>FlexiArm side brush and mop automatically extend to reach corners</strong> and edges that circular robots typically miss, sweeping along baseboards and into tight spots where crumbs accumulate.</p>
<p>The AdaptiLift chassis <strong>climbs over obstacles as high as 4 cm</strong> and tackles thresholds and furniture legs that stop lesser robots dead in their tracks and turn your open floor plan into an actual open floor plan rather than a series of isolated zones. The dual-spinning mops automatically lift when carpets get detected to avoid getting your rugs soaked while still making thorough mopping possible on hard floors.</p>



<p>The Multifunctional Dock 4.0 does the dirty work you would avoid by automatically washing mops in 176°F hot water and drying them with 131°F hot air to prevent mildew and smell. <strong>Auto dust collection works for 60 days before needing attention</strong> while auto tank refilling and detergent dispensing mean the robot maintains itself between the occasional check-in you give it.</p>
<p>At $999 instead of the usual $1,599, you’re saving $600 on a machine that brings flagship features reserved for people with unlimited home automation budgets. This Black Friday price opens up the most advanced robot vacuum technology to households wanting exceptional cleaning results without compromise on coverage, power, or convenience.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/samsung-t7-ssd-goes-for-pocket-change-now-2tb-drive-selling-68-off-original-price-2000647374</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/samsung-t7-ssd-goes-for-pocket-change-now-2tb-drive-selling-68-off-original-price.1364884/</guid>

              <p>Samsung earned its reputation as the <strong>most reliable brand for SSDs</strong> through years of consistent performance and the T7 has been an iconic model in portable storage since its launch a few years back. Traditional external hard drives (HDD) feel painfully slow once you experience the speed difference that solid-state technology delivers, and even more as <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4613/">this T7 model just hit a record low at $168 instead of the usual $187 (and $399 at launch!) for Black Friday on Amazon</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Most color options already sold out completely</strong> which leaves only the gray version in stock so you’ll need to move fast if you want one before inventory disappears entirely. This<strong> drive transfers files at speeds up to 1,050MB/s</strong> which means copying a full 4K movie takes under a minute instead of the 5+ minutes you’d spend waiting with an old spinning hard drive.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4613/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Forget Your Old HDD</h2>
<p>The USB 3.2 Gen 2 interface pushes<strong> read speeds to 1,050MB/s and write speeds close behind</strong>, which gives you transfer rates that actually match modern file sizes and project demands. You can edit 4K video directly from the drive without pre-copying footage to your computer’s internal storage, saving time and preserving precious laptop SSD space for applications and system files. With a <strong>total capacity of 2TB, you’ll have room for approximately 500,000 photos</strong>, 50 hours of 4K video, or your entire game library plus room for new titles.</p>



<p>Measuring <strong>smaller than a credit card and weighing only 58 grams</strong>, the compact design disappears into any bag pocket without adding noticeable bulk or weight to your carry. The metal construction provides shock resistance that protects your data against drops from as high as 2 meters-though you obviously shouldn’t test that limit on purpose, just because the specs say it can handle it.</p>
<p><strong>Efficient thermal management</strong> keeps the drive cool during extended file transfers, preventing performance throttling when you’re moving massive amounts of data for longer periods. <strong>Password protection and AES 256-bit hardware encryption</strong> secure your files in case the drive gets lost or stolen, providing peace of mind that your client projects or personal photos will not end up in random hands.</p>



<p>Cross-platform compatibility works <strong>seamlessly across Windows, Mac, Android devices</strong>&nbsp;and gaming consoles without requiring reformatting or special drivers for basic use. The<strong> included USB-C to C and USB-C to A cables</strong> cover connection to virtually any modern device, though you’ll want the C-to-C cable for maximum speed with newer computers. Samsung’s Magician software provides drive health monitoring, firmware updates, and performance optimization tools that help maintain peak performance over the years. <strong>The three-year limited warranty</strong> backs up Samsung’s confidence in the drive’s reliability, covering manufacturing defects and giving you recourse if something goes wrong.</p>
<p>At $168 for 2TB of fast and reliable Samsung storage, you’re getting the brand’s proven track record at one of the lowest prices this model has ever seen which makes it the right moment to upgrade from slower storage solutions. This Black Friday deal delivers great portable storage at a price that finally makes sense for people who need speed and capacity without emptying their wallets.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Amazon Offloads 65W 3-Port Block Charger, 2-Pack Selling for 4x Cheaper Than One Apple Charger]]></title>
            <link>https://kotaku.com/amazon-offloads-65w-3-port-block-charger-2-pack-selling-for-4x-cheaper-than-one-apple-charger-2000647316</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Buying official chargers from tech companies feels like highway robbery when you see Apple charging $59 for a basic 35W single-port USB-C adapter which makes you wonder if they think everyone has unlimited money to burn on accessories.</p>
<p>The <strong>Baseus 2-pack 65W charger bundle</strong> flips that equation completely by <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5748/">giving you two three-port chargers for $28 total, dropping from the usual $49 price tag</a> to hit an all-time low for Black Friday on Amazon. Each charger pushes 65W when you plug in a single device which means you can actually fast-charge a MacBook Air at full speed instead of watching the battery percentage crawl upward like a lazy snail. You get <strong>six charging ports total across both units</strong>, and that’s the kind of flexibility that solves the eternal problem of fighting over outlets.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5748/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>65W, Two Chargers</h2>
<p>The intelligent charging technology inside these blocks automatically figures out how much power each connected device needs and <strong>splits the 65W accordingly</strong>&nbsp;so you’re not manually calculating wattage or worrying about frying your phone because you plugged it into the wrong port. You can charge your laptop, phone, and earbuds simultaneously from a single charger without everything slowing down to a frustrating trickle, though connecting<strong> three devices does divide that 65W among them</strong> based on what each one can handle. It also operates on a <strong>92% energy conversion rate thanks to the GaN chip technology</strong>&nbsp;which means less wasted electricity and noticeably cooler operation compared to older, silicon-based chargers that get hot enough to cook an egg.</p>



<p>The compact size is <strong>41% smaller than Apple’s original 65W brick</strong> and matters more than you think once you’re trying to fit chargers into already-stuffed laptop bags or tight outlet spaces behind furniture. <strong>Foldable prongs</strong> collapse flush against the body so they won’t snag on clothes or scratch other gear rattling around in your backpack.</p>
<p>You can fast-charge an<strong> iPhone 17 from 0 to 50% in about 30 minutes</strong> or power up a Dell laptop without the need for its original, bulky charger. The <strong>USB-A port handles older devices</strong> that haven’t made the USB-C jump yet and saves you from having to carry separate adapters for wireless headphones, older tablets, or that one weird gadget that just refuses to adopt modern standards.</p>



<p>The <strong>lower operating temperature</strong> keeps these chargers safe to touch even after hours of continuous use, unlike some cheap alternatives that get concerningly hot and make you nervous about leaving them plugged in overnight. Each port delivers consistent power without the voltage fluctuations that can damage batteries over time, protecting your expensive devices while they charge.</p>
<p>At $28 for two 65W three-port chargers, you’re spending less than half what Apple charges for their wimpy 35W single-port adapter, and you’re getting roughly six times the functionality in return. This Black Friday price works out to $14 per charger which is basically impulse-purchase territory for accessories that’ll get daily use for years.</p>
