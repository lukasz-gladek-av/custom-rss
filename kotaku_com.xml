              <p>Microsoft first unveiled Windows 11 and its Pro version in 2021, and since then, the OS has become the go-to option for students, work professionals, creatives, gamers, and even casual users.</p>
<p>If you’ve been meaning to upgrade but don’t want to spend close to $200 on a license, we’ve found an affordable (and legitimate) route. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4452/">Stacksocial is currently offering a lifetime license for Microsoft Windows 11 Pro for just $15.</a> That’s a straightforward $184 discount on a one-and-done purchase. Once your purchase is successful, you will receive a digital license key via email, which you can redeem and activate on one device within 30 days.</p>

<h2>A Wide Range of Built-In Productivity Features</h2>
<p>For $15, you’re getting full access to one of the most user-friendly operating systems out there. It comes with a bunch of productive features, such as snap layouts, better voice typing, virtual desktops, and built-in AI with Copilot. Work professionals who take security and performance seriously will also appreciate BitLocker device encryption, Hyper-V virtualization, and Windows Sandbox – all of which make it easy to manage sensitive files and work remotely. Even better, there’s DirectX 12 Ultimate support to ensure a more immersive, high-performance gaming experience on compatible hardware.</p>
<p>However, there are some hardware and system requirements you need to meet before making the jump. Your device will need at least 4GB of RAM, 64GB of storage, a UEFI-based system with Secure Boot, and TPM 2.0 support. It also needs to be running Windows 10 or higher to complete the upgrade process. The display should be at least 9 inches diagonally with 720p resolution and 8 bits per color channel. Also, make sure you have a stable internet connection during the activation process to prevent any slowdowns.</p>



<p>Most modern devices already meet these specs, but we highly recommend double-checking before purchasing. It’s also important to note that this is a digital-only deal, and everything is handled via email. Once you’re all set, proceed with your purchase and use the activation code you receive to finish the process.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4452/">Overall, it’s a solid opportunity for anyone looking to switch to Windows 11 Pro without spending a lot</a>. This deal takes $184 off the usual $199 price, letting you upgrade for just $15. That’s a massive 92% discount, but it might not last long. Those looking to try Windows 11 Home can also get it for $15, down from $139 after an 89% discount.</p>
