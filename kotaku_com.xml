              <p><em>Marathon</em> has been <a href="https://kotaku.com/playstation-fans-mad-marathon-bluepoint-boycott-ps5-bungie-2000672040">playing catch-up</a> to <em>Arc Raiders</em> ever since both games debuted their first player tests last year. But Bungie’s extraction shooter finally seems to have moved ahead when it comes to fair play and exploits. The development team revealed that <em>Marathon</em> will have a strict one-strike ban policy when it comes to cheating, which is more than can be said for <a href="https://kotaku.com/arc-raiders-review-extraction-loot-shooter-embark-2000642198"><em>Arc Raiders</em></a>.</p> <p>“Anyone found to be cheating will be permabanned from playing <em>Marathon</em> forever, no second chances,” Bungie wrote <a href="https://www.bungie.net/7/en/News/Article/marathonsecurity">in a new blog post</a> previewing the multiplayer shooter’s upcoming server slam on February 26. The rest of the post lays out the different features and systems <em>Marathon</em> uses to maintain network security and limit the kinds of exploits that could be deployed during matches.</p>

 <p>Bungie boasts a “new server authority model” that automatically rejects “invalid client actions” before they can impact other players’ experiences. “This protects the gameplay experience against exploits such as teleporting, unlimited ammo, or damage manipulation,” Bungie writes. There’s also a “fog of war” that limits what map information each player has access to so that player and item locations remain safe from “wall hacks” or “ESP cheats.”</p> <p>While “client-side security upgrades,” a telemetry “backend analysis system,” and getting your loot back if your game accidentally crashes or disconnects all sound great, the proof will be in how <em>Marathon</em> performs out in the wild. <a href="https://kotaku.com/bungie-cheat-lawsuit-destiny-2-aimjunkies-aimbot-1850140970"><em>Destiny 2</em></a> players have dealt with a range of cheating epidemics over the years, and even the most determined teams and processes don’t always get the job done.</p>

 <h2><em>Arc Raiders</em> is still dogged by complaints about rampant cheating</h2> <p>But one strike and you’re out for cheaters should be reassuring to people familiar with <em>Arc Raiders</em>‘ <a href="https://kotaku.com/arc-raiders-patch-cheating-out-of-bounds-embark-2000661267">current cheating issues</a>. The current extraction shooter king implemented strict permabans back in January, but only for repeat offenders. “A three strikes progressive ban system is in the process of being implemented,” read the <a href="https://arcraiders.com/news/patch-notes-1-13-0">patch notes</a> at the time. “Bans will progress from 30 days, to 60 and finally a permaban for repeat offenders.”</p>

 <p>The latest exploit du jour involves players spawning their own hatches <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/third-person-shooter/arc-raiders-cheaters-are-now-spawning-their-own-hatches-to-escape-death-and-players-are-once-again-begging-embark-to-punish-cheating-more-the-fact-people-can-do-this-is-insane/">to escape death</a>. “I’ve seen mod menus and all sorts of hacks in games before but for some reason this is the most ridiculous shit to me,” says&nbsp;<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ArcRaiders/comments/1ravr41/how_are_the_people_not_getting_perma_bans/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-analytics-id="inline-link" data-url="https://www.reddit.com/r/ArcRaiders/comments/1ravr41/how_are_the_people_not_getting_perma_bans/" data-hl-processed="none" data-mrf-recirculation="inline-link" data-hawk-tracked="hawklinks" data-mrf-link="https://www.reddit.com/r/ArcRaiders/comments/1ravr41/how_are_the_people_not_getting_perma_bans/">one commenter</a> on Reddit. Fans have been begging for better exploit detection and harsher penalties for perpetrators, but so far<em> Arc Raiders</em> has been taking a concerted but more cautious approach to weeding out cheaters.</p> <p>The game’s also suffered from a range of <a href="https://kotaku.com/arc-raiders-dup-glitch-hotfix-patch-1-15-2000667320">duplication glitches</a>, which is bad when a scarcity of resources is a key mechanic in your game. <em>Marathon</em> is preparing for that potential challenge as well. “We take your investment of time seriously,” Bungie wrote. “We will strive to keep your progress safe and protected from item duplication or other economic cheats.” While that may be true,<em> Marathon</em>‘s first duplication glitch feels less like a matter of if than when.</p>

              <p>Online-only live-service co-op game <em>King of Meat</em> launched last fall. About four months later, the game announced that its servers would be shutting off in April. This has become a very familiar story in the game industry.</p> <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/king-meat-glowmade-layoffs-keighley-mrbeast-trailer-2000651722"><em>King of Meat</em></a> launched on October 31, 2025, and cost $30. In the lead-up to the launch of the Amazon-published game, it got a flashy (and likely very expensive) <a href="https://youtu.be/iT5ilwECdrA?t=3000">animated trailer</a> at Gamescom Opening Night Live in August 2024. There was even a (also likely expensive) promotional video from MrBeast featuring content creators playing <em>King of Meat</em> in a big tournament. Reportedly, leadership at Glowmade, the studio behind the game, was aiming for around 100,000 concurrent players on Steam at launch. It never exceeded more than <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/1926980/charts/">400</a> according to SteamDB and never cracked 1,000 across consoles and PC. Shocking nobody, layoffs were planned in late December. Now, the game is shutting down.</p>  <p><a href="https://steamcommunity.com/games/1926980/announcements/detail/527620350145462992/">On February 23,&nbsp; Amazon announced</a> that <em>King of Meat</em>‘s servers will shut off for good on April 9, 2026 in a post titled “The Future of <em>King of Meat.”</em></p>

 <p><wbr>“Despite the creativity and innovation Glowmade brought to <em>King of Meat,</em> the game has unfortunately not found the audience we hoped for,” said the post. “As a result, we have made the difficult decision to conclude our investment in the game, and <em>King of Mea</em>t’s servers will close on April 9, 2026. Players will be able to access and play all existing content until then, so we encourage you to enjoy your remaining time in the game with your fellow Contenders.”</p> <p>All players who purchased <em>King of Meat</em> will receive a full refund “in the coming weeks,” according to the post announcing the game’s demise.</p> <p><wbr>“We want to sincerely thank every player who supported <em>King of Meat</em> and the wonderful community that formed around it,” said Amazon. “Your enthusiasm, imagination, and feedback have meant the world to us and to the team at Glowmade. We’re grateful for Glowmade’s partnership and passion throughout this journey and wish them continued success in the future.”</p> <h2>Stop trying to force people to play more live-service games</h2> <p>This is far from the first live-service game that’s announced a shutdown over the last few years. In fact, the odds are high that if a studio launches an online-only live-service game, it will be dead in about a year or less nowadays. We <a href="https://kotaku.com/concord-shutting-down-closing-servers-refunds-ps5-1851638566">famously saw that with <em>Concord</em> in 2024,</a> which was such a disastrous launch that it died in less than two weeks and torpedoed Sony’s ongoing live-service game efforts, likely leading to canceled projects and studio closures as PlayStation reevaluated its strategy. <a href="https://kotaku.com/sonys-new-live-service-game-is-coming-at-just-the-worst-possible-time-2000666078">It hasn’t given up entirely, though.</a></p>

 <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/sonys-ps5-era-studio-acquisition-spree-has-been-a-disaster-2000671404">But Sony isn’t alone in its desperate, messy push for forever games that can print money</a>. Amazon is shutting down its once-popular MMO <em>New World</em>, and before that, killed online shooter <em>Crucible</em>, <a href="https://kotaku.com/troubled-amazon-shooter-crucible-is-shutting-down-1845330651">a game that I can almost bet nobody remembers in 2026</a>. You could make a pretty long list of all the live-service and other online games that have died in recent years. <a href="https://kotaku.com/dead-games-2023-delisted-servers-offline-1850083031">Actually, we have done that.</a> It just keeps happening. And yet, publishers keep investing a lot of money and resources into chasing <em>Fortnite</em> and other live-service hits, despite being surrounded by a graveyard of past attempts. <a href="https://kotaku.com/most-playstation-5-owners-have-been-playing-the-same-games-since-2022-2000672009">And the few big winners there are these days came out years ago, and everyone is still playing them.</a></p>

 <p>Hopefully, the folks at Glowmade can bounce back, along with all other affected devs, and the industry stops trying to make 500 more live-service games nobody clearly wants. Yes, <em>Helldivers 2</em> succeeded. There are rare exceptions, sure. But odds are your in-development live-service project won’t be so lucky.<wbr><wbr></p>

            <title><![CDATA[The Story Behind One Of The Best Video Game Magazine Covers Of All Time]]></title>
            <link>https://kotaku.com/final-fantasy-10-yoshitaka-amano-art-egm-2000672858</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><span>The 2000s was a new dawn for console gaming. The PlayStation 2, Xbox, GameCube and even Dreamcast were expanding the horizons of what dreams could unfurl on the living room TV. It was a heyday for print publications as well, the specialty press being the best window between players and this unwritten future. </span><i><span>Electronic Gaming Monthly</span></i><span> (</span><i><span>EGM</span></i><span>) was one of the biggest on the shelves, and in 2001 they’d flex those bonafides with a gorgeous, original cover from </span><i><span>Final Fantasy</span></i><span> artist Yoshitaka Amano. It turns out landing on those shelves was kind of an accident.</span></p> <p><span>After </span><i><span>Final Fantasy VII</span></i><span> stunned PlayStation owners, the signature SquareSoft series finally found a level of popularity abroad that had previously been elusive outside of Japan. Its first outing on next-generation consoles was going to be a hot affair, with new fidelity and processing power able to render these adventures, exploits and intimacies better than ever before. Cover material for sure.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><span>At </span><i><span>EGM</span></i><span>, then editor-in-chief Dan “Shoe” Hsu wanted something special for </span><i><span>Final Fantasy X</span></i><span>. “Shoe wanted to see if we could commission an Amano painting for the cover and it got [complicated] because we needed Square’s permission,” </span><a href="https://bsky.app/profile/milkman.bsky.social/post/3mfcduiavxs22"><span>posted James Mielke</span></a><span>, famed </span><i><span>EGM</span></i><span> alumni. “Plus, it cost us $10,000 when the average art budget for a cover was essentially zero.”</span></p>   <p><span>Surprisingly, publisher ZiffDavis gave them the green light. Mielke personally oversaw the cover’s creation, with Amano’s turnaround being much faster than expected. Amano used gold leaf for the painting, which </span><i><span>EGM</span></i><span>’s printer struggled to do justice. The interesting complexion of the finished cover remained alluring all the same.</span></p>

 <p><span>That wasn’t the only complication. According to Hsu’s follow-up thread, the Amano cover was intended to go to all </span><i><span>EGM</span></i><span> subscribers, with only 25 percent shipping to retail, taking a page from the ‘90s superhero comics boom. “I wanted it to be very exclusive and rare. And I thought the non-Amano cover would be more mainstream anyways,” </span><a href="https://bsky.app/profile/danshoehsu.bsky.social/post/3mfck67rpy226"><span>posted Hsu</span></a><span>. “Something got miscommunicated along the way.”</span></p>

 <p><span>Instead, the publisher thought they wanted Amano to occupy 25 percent of all covers overall. Meaning some subscribers ended up with the standard issue, featuring pretty decent key art of Yuna, and retail shelves found themselves with way more of the painterly approach.</span></p> <div><blockquote data-bluesky-uri="at://did:plc:zum2teecl6yxcchpcuuc4drk/app.bsky.feed.post/3mfck67rpy226" data-bluesky-cid="bafyreicfysrtymishocluoqnylgupjsp46nfss2h2jcipzusd3bttn47nu"> <p lang="en">But something got miscommunicated along the way and the entire run (newsstands + subs) got 25% Amano. I wondered if some subscribers (those who weren’t into Final Fantasy) would be less happy. And that’s also X more people who wouldn’t buy the Amano issue (this was a sales stunt, after all). 🧵2/</p> <p>— <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/did:plc:zum2teecl6yxcchpcuuc4drk?ref_src=embed">Shoe (@danshoehsu.bsky.social)</a> <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/did:plc:zum2teecl6yxcchpcuuc4drk/post/3mfck67rpy226?ref_src=embed">2026-02-20T16:37:10.361Z</a></p></blockquote></div>  <p><span>While some of those subscribers felt burned, overall it proved a happy mistake. Readers seemed chuffed by the gorgeous surprise and it boosted sales considerably, making it one of </span><i><span>EGM</span></i><span>’s best selling-issues. Even </span><a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2001/08/07/limited-edition-final-fantasy-x-cover"><span>nascent digital rival </span><i><span>IGN</span></i><span> wrote about it</span></a><span>. ZiffDavis allowed another commission from Amano two years later for a </span><i><span>Final Fantasy Everything</span></i><span> cover. Mielke is just happy to see the art </span><a href="https://bsky.app/profile/milkman.bsky.social/post/3mfce4i5qws22"><span>make its way into Zippo culture</span></a><span>.</span></p>

 <p><span>Sadly, the new millennium wasn’t too friendly to printed specialty press. </span><i><span>EGM</span></i><span>’s print run ended in 2009, its beloved digital counterpart </span><i><span>1UP.com</span></i><span> being closed not long after in 2013. However, its legacy still lives on. A crowdfunded </span><i><span>EGM</span></i><span> anthology raised $1.7 million, the </span><a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/egmbook/egmcompendium/posts/4609961"><span>tomes heading to press in the short future</span></a><span>. Mielke recently announced he’s releasing </span><a href="https://www.theverge.com/entertainment/882892/final-fantasy-nobuo-uematsu-biography"><span>a biography of </span><i><span>Final Fantasy</span></i><span> composer Nobuo Uematsu</span></a><span> through Viz. Amano, meanwhile, still seems to like the taste of variant covers, having done numerous </span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/DCcomics/comments/1hko02d/artwork_batman_superman_and_harley_quinn_by/"><span>for DC comics</span></a><span> in recent years.</span></p> <p><span>Still, the printed page for games press is sorely missed. On top of gorgeous art and ink, they offered a level of discoverability to new games </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/steam-next-fest-feb-2026-indie-demos-2000672657"><span>more elegant than the current law of the jungle</span></a><span>. </span></p>

                                                      </p><div>
              
              <p>We hear a lot about “puzzle platformers,” but none has ever taken the notion as literally as <em><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3249380/Piece_by_Piece/">Piece by Piece</a>.&nbsp;</em>This is a collection of tiny platform games by Neon Polygons, set within the rearrangeable pieces of a jigsaw puzzle, and it’s really ever-so smart.</p> <p><em>Piece by Piece&nbsp;</em>sets its agenda from the very first puzzle. You play as a little king dude trapped inside a single jigsaw puzzle piece. However, when you click in another piece he’s then able to run between the two—so long as there’s not a wall or obstacle blocking his path. So you’d imagine this would start with your just connecting three pieces together and running from left to right to get to grips with the conceit. But no! <em>Piece by Piece</em> wants you on top of things straight away, and you’re going to need to do a slightly more complicated bit of piece juggling to be able to get past a solid wall impeding your path.</p>

  <p>In the full game, due out March 13, you’ll then spend a fair while with this little guy and his challenges, learning the neat tricks the game has to offer like falling vertically from one piece to the next, or snatching pieces away just in time such that he lands on their bottom edge before he can fall through to the next. This is then really drummed into you, and for a moment you wonder if this is it, if this is the extent of the game’s ideas, before it suddenly furls like a fabulous flower and reveals six brand new twists on the format, each with not only their own set of challenges, but then paired up to combine their features for even more. So you might now be an alien trying to move around by creating portals that only work when pieces are connected, or the cutest little drill-guy who burrows through lines of rock, then the two combined into some really brain-pushing challenges.</p> <p>The demo that’s out now is smart enough to not just stick with the opening set of puzzles, but instead jumps about a bit, quickly moving on from the king to the princess lady (who in the full game has to deal with puzzles that require some complicated jiggery-pokery to have flat puzzle pieces align rather than the usual fitting of tabs into sockets), and then to the teleporting alien, the drill guy, and finally those two combined. Said demo includes a total of 13 puzzles, and while they likely won’t have you stumped for long, they certainly give you a great idea of what’s on offer here.</p>

 <p>In the full game you’ll be using magic tiles that can copy pieces, two-sided pieces you can flip, rotating pieces…you get the idea. And it gets&nbsp;<em>much</em> tougher as it goes along, offering some properly juicy head-scratchers. We’ll have a full review when the game is properly out, but for now you should know it’s well worth <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3249380/Piece_by_Piece/">checking out the demo and putting on your wishlist</a>.</p>
