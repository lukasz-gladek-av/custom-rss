              <p>I’m currently exploring, crafting and building my way through&nbsp;<em>Minecraft</em>-like <em>Hytale</em> to find out what this long-delayed blocky survival sim does to differentiate itself from its obvious inspiration. But in the meantime, let’s take a look at what’s already happened in the game’s first 24 hours since releasing into early access.</p> <p><em>Hytale&nbsp;</em>very nearly didn’t happen. The cuboid sandbox game has been in production since 2015 from Hypixel Studios, with financial support from Riot Games for the first few years until the massive company bought Hypixel outright in 2020. However, big twist: in June 2025 Riot cancelled the whole project, leaving its future in serious doubt. But then another twist: in November of last year, the game’s original founder Simon Collins-Laflamme bought the entire IP back from Riot <a href="https://kotaku.com/hytale-riot-minecraft-hypixel-revived-cancel-shutdown-2000645248">and revived development</a>. Just two months later the game is out in early access, making Riot’s decision all the more peculiar.</p>

 <p>It’s not nearly finished, it’s fair to say. If <a href="https://hytale.com/">you buy the game now</a> you’ll find its central hub area is mostly various buildings with “Under Construction” signs on them, and the game’s “Adventure” mode is yet to be added alongside Survival and Creative. However, you’ll also find a very familiar style of game if you’ve ever played <em>Minecraft</em>, but with much higher-fidelity graphics, a far more complex array of crafting tables, and the slightest touch of creature collecting. So how’s it going so far?</p>

 <p>Well, pretty well! In the first 24 hours&nbsp;<em>Hytale</em> became <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/survival-crafting/hytale-surges-to-the-most-watched-game-on-twitch-attracting-over-420-000-viewers-with-its-long-awaited-launch/">the most watched game on Twitch</a>, with 420,000 viewers across many, many streams. And perhaps more significantly, Collins-Laflamme took to X just before launch to say pre-orders have been so successful that the game has already secured a further two years of development costs.</p>

 <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">Pleased to announce that we have officially secured the next two years of development costs through pre-purchases. Combined with my personal commitment of ten years, we are looking very strong for the future ❤️</p> <p>Thank you all for the support.</p> <p>Hytale is saved.<br>We are almost home.</p> <p>— Simon (@Simon_Hypixel) <a href="https://twitter.com/Simon_Hypixel/status/2010691717637222614?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 12, 2026</a></p></blockquote>  <h2>Yay Patch Notes!</h2> <p>The game <a href="https://hytale.com/news/2026/1/hotfixes-13-january-2026">has already received its first hotfix</a>, aimed at fixing crashes caused by eyebrows, squelching a bug that stopped Norwegian people from launching it, and preventing buckets from breaking the game. Of course, this being early access, Hypixel are keen to communicate that the game is still going to be packed with issues and bugs. In <a href="https://hytale.com/news/2026/1/hytale-is-finally-here">a blog post celebrating the pre-release of the game</a>, the team asks people to keep in mind the following:</p>

 <ul> <li>Early Access – many features are still missing, and bugs are expected</li> <li>It’s only been two months since we reacquired <em>Hytale</em> – and that’s how long we’ve had to prepare the game and rebuild the team from the ground up</li> <li>Demand has exceeded our expectations, which means launch week will be bumpy, but we’ll get everyone in</li> </ul> <p>The game, which is currently only available for PC but plans to make its way to PS5 and Xbox, does already allow modding and as such, people are already getting creative. Perhaps the most stand-out example would be <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/survival-crafting/one-modder-has-already-got-doom-running-inside-the-voxel-sandbox-hytale-and-its-not-even-out-yet-it-plays-a-bit-like-a-broken-keyboard/">someone getting&nbsp;<em>Doom</em> running in the game</a> before it even released. As <em>PC Gamer</em> spotted, it’s achieved by importing a Java version of id’s shooter, then having it rendered via color-changing blocks within <em>Hytale</em>. Or witchcraft.</p>

 <h2>Exploration Motivation</h2> <p>The Exploration mode is the “proper” way to play the game just now, where the procedurally generated collection of biomes contains really elaborate structures to discover, and also all the core ingredients for the <em>Minecraft</em> survivalist. So you can build homes (I’ve made a lovely log cabin!), grow crops, craft ever-more useful tools, and do all this solo or with chums. Digging down proves similarly elaborate, with big underground structures to explore, and of course mobs to battle. There are also the vestigial beginnings of the game’s story, with a hub area you can teleport to once you find the Forgotten Temple, speak to a couple of NPCs, and begin a task to identify as many species of creatures as you can in order to unlock new crafts.</p>

 <p>The forthcoming Adventure mode appears to promise a lot more RPG-like elements that will hopefully better distinguish the game from its inspirations, but in the meantime the focus is really on venturing far from where you spawn and discovering its much more detailed landscapes and the mobs within.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[This Asus TUF Gaming Desktop PC (Nvidia GPU, 512GB SSD) Is So Cheap You’ll Want to Buy It Instantly]]></title>
            <link>https://kotaku.com/this-asus-tuf-gaming-desktop-pc-nvidia-gpu-512gb-ssd-is-so-cheap-youll-want-to-buy-it-instantly-2000659757</link>
            <guid>1406041</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Yes, you can game on most standard PCs out there, but these options aren’t designed to provide you with an immersive gaming experience that brings your favorite titles to life. If you’re looking to play better in 2026, a dedicated gaming PC is a must-have.</p>
<p>Like all nice things, the best gaming PCs on the market can cost a pretty penny, but that’s not the case today. Amazon just dropped the 2025 ASUS TUF T500 PC by 11% which <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6757/">brings its $900 price to $800 – an impressive $100 discount</a>. There are no complicated coupon codes to enter or long checkout steps to worry about, either. Just add the PC to your cart, and the discount applies automatically.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6757/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See offer</a></p>

<h2>Premium Look, Incredible Performance</h2>
<p>The PC flaunts a stunning, mecha-inspired design with bold lines, yellow accents, and a transparent side panel. It gives off a rugged, anime-inspired look that’s instantly going to catch the attention of anyone and is sure to turn heads. The clear side panel offers a stunning view of your rig with RGB lighting. The lights are customizable, so you can choose the color you want. Maybe go for yellow for a premium feel, or something a bit more vibrant if you want your PC to make a statement.</p>
<p>It runs on an Intel Core i5-13420H CPU that offers a great balance of performance and price. Paired with the NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3050 GPU, it can run most modern games smoothly, and even lets you work on resource-intensive creative projects with ease. There’s a modest 16GB RAM that keeps things snappy as you push through tasks. We’re talking casual gaming with friends while streaming, and juggling demanding tasks like video editing and 3D design without slowing down.</p>



<p>The 512GB PCIe Gen 4 SSD storage makes it easy to keep all your favorite gaming titles, plus other media content and projects close, in a single place. SSDs are also known to be much faster than their traditional counterparts in terms of performance. What does this mean for you? Speedy file transfers and much quicker application launches throughout the day. Despite all this performance, the PC stays cool as it works. That’s thanks to its custom copper heatpipes and a 90mm fan, both of which come together to offer optimized airflow. This keeps the temperatures in check and also prevents noisy operation, even when things get a bit intense.</p>



<p>Exceptional durability comes from the PC’s MIL-STD-810H certification against shock, vibration, heat, and altitude. Basically, it’s going to support your gaming adventures and creative projects for years to come. Speaking of long-term use, you’ll also appreciate the tool-less side panels and the spacious interior, which make it easy to upgrade and maintain your system over time. It’s built to grow with you as your needs change.</p>
<p>To wrap it up, if you’ve been on the lookout for a reliable, muscular gaming PC that can handle pressure well, the ASUS TUF T500 is an excellent option to consider. It’s now down to $800, after Amazon generously took $100 off its usual price. We highly recommend grabbing it as soon as you can, as the price can shoot back up at any moment now.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[The Coolest Thing About Deadpool In Marvel Rivals Isn’t The Role Swapping]]></title>
            <link>https://kotaku.com/deadpool-marvel-rivals-role-fourth-wall-break-meta-2000659834</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/marvel-rivals-deadpool-daredevil-leak-audio-voice-lines-overwatch-2-lady-gaga-2000620344"><span>Deadpool</span></a><span> is coming to </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/marvel-rivals-review-hero-shooter-overwatch-netease-1851717975"><i><span>Marvel Rivals</span></i></a><span>, and it’s fitting that the Merc with a Mouth would pretty much break every rule the hero shooter has established in its first year. He’s a flex character that is capable of swapping between the tank, damage, and support roles throughout a match, and he already looks like a pretty busted version of all three based on the first gameplay trailer. But one of the cool, less-talked-about aspects of </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/deadpool-vr-is-a-game-for-deadpool-fans-and-nobody-else-2000645514"><span>Deadpool’s</span></a><span> kit is how it implements his status as a fourth-wall-breaking troublemaker into his ability set.</span></p>  <p><span>With all of his erratic movements and all the comic-book-style frames and other details that frequently pop up around him, </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/x-men-movies-best-worst-ranked-deadpool-logan-wolverine-1851595435"><span>Deadpool’s</span></a><span> moveset is one of the harder ones to read in the </span><i><span>Marvel Rivals</span></i><span> roster. I’m sure once we actually get to play as the character, we’ll all get more familiar with his arsenal of tools and develop a sense of what he’s capable of. But for now, one of the things that stands out to me is how NetEase implemented the meta element of the character into how he fights.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><span>Throughout a match, Deadpool will level up with buffs depending on his role, and you access these by opening up a </span><i><span>Marvel Rivals </span></i><span>comic book that Deadpool will flip through as you choose your upgrades. He also has abilities that break the fourth wall, such as one that shows a mini streamer portrait of the hero on an opponent’s screen that smacks them around with a hammer. Not sure how you avoid that or if it’s a sort of “status effect” with a set duration, but it’s appropriately obnoxious for Wade Wilson’s kit to have comic-book pop-ups and winks to the camera.</span></p>

 <p><span>Deadpool is joining the </span><i><span>Marvel Rivals </span></i><span>roster in season 6, which begins on January 16.</span></p>

            <title><![CDATA[Rockstar Is Now Selling $200+ GTA Roleplay Mod Bundles On Its New Marketplace]]></title>
            <link>https://kotaku.com/gta-cfx-marketplace-mods-online-rdr2-2000659824</link>
            <guid>1405933</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><span>Rockstar Games has just launched the Cfx Marketplace, described as “a curated digital storefront” which will allow a select group of creators “to share and sell” mods for both </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/grand-theft-auto-5-gta-6-mod-ai-npc-legal-youtube-1850749678"><i><span>Grand Theft Auto V</span></i></a><span> and </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/red-dead-redemption-2-mod-video-npc-memories-blurbs-2000631070"><i><span>Red Dead Redemption II</span></i></a><span>.</span><span><br> </span><span><br> </span><span>Rockstar Games, and by extension its parent company Take-Two Interactive, has a harsh and often litigious relationship with its modding community. Although the developer has never truly been supportive of modding efforts for its games, Rockstar’s laser-focused approach to issuing </span><i><span>GTA</span></i><span>-related takedown notices took root in 2019, following a string of DMCA takedowns for mods on both ModDB and GTA5-Mods.</span><span><br> </span><span><br> </span><span>As a user on the </span><a href="https://gtaforums.com/topic/974338-take-two-vs-the-gta-modding-community-2021-ee-edition/#comments"><span>GTA Forums explained</span></a><span>, this new wave of takedown notices was attributed to a change in Rockstar Games’ user agreement in 2019 that banned modding, while the previous 2017 agreement had no such provision. (That previous user agreement has since been “excluded from the wayback machine” and therefore can no longer be found online.)</span></p> <figure id="attachment_2000659827" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000659827"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000659827">Rockstar Games / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p><span><br> </span><span>Since then, Take-Two’s legal team has been ruthless in their legal pursuits against a string of </span><i><span>Grand Theft Auto </span></i><span>mods. In 2025 alone, the mod teams behind </span><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/gta-5-liberty-city-preservation-project-shut-down/"><span>Liberty City Preservation Project</span></a><span> (a mod which transplanted </span><i><span>GTA IV’s</span></i><span> map into </span><i><span>GTA V</span></i><span>), a </span><a href="https://www.tomshardware.com/video-games/browser-run-copy-of-grand-theft-auto-gets-taken-down-by-dcma-take-two-says-dos-zone-infringed-companys-intellectual-property-rights-despite-disclaimers-and-requirement-to-own-original-copy-of-title-to-run-full-game-online"><span>web browser port</span></a><span> of </span><i><span>GTA: Vice City</span></i><span>, and </span><a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/playable-gta-6-map-mod-project-vice-is-no-more-following-take-two-copyright-strike"><span>Project Vice</span></a><span> (which modded </span><i><span>Grand Theft Auto VI’s</span></i><span> leaked map data into </span><i><span>GTA V</span></i><span>) were all issued DMCA takedown notices by Take-Two Interactive.</span><span><br> </span><span><br> </span><span>However, in spite of all this, Rockstar Games announced an exception to their “policy on mods” in 2022, following the ever-growing popularity of Cfx.re’s </span><i><span>Grand Theft Auto V</span></i><span> and </span><i><span>Red Dead Redemption II</span></i><span> roleplay servers FiveM and RedM. Then, in 2023, Rockstar Games revealed </span><a href="https://www.rockstargames.com/newswire/article/8971o8789584a4/roleplay-community-update"><span>that Cfx.re was</span></a><span> “now officially a part of Rockstar Games.”</span><span><br> </span><span><br> </span><span>Funnily enough, in 2015, Rockstar Games banned the Rockstar Social Club accounts of several of the members behind FiveM. Rockstar Games then </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/rockstar-allegedly-bans-modders-for-making-alternative-1723093679"><span>issued an official statement</span></a><span> which explained that the FiveM project “is an unauthorized alternate multiplayer service that contains code designed to facilitate piracy.”</span></p>

 <h2>The <em>GTA</em>&nbsp;mods will be monetized</h2> <p><a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/rockstar-launches-official-marketplace-for-mods"><span>Earlier this week</span></a><span> on January 12, Cfx announced the </span><a href="https://forum.cfx.re/t/introducing-the-cfx-marketplace/5369289"><span>Cfx Marketplace</span></a><span>, which they described as “a curated digital storefront where talented FiveM/RedM creators can share and sell their work.” Although the marketplace is clearly aimed at </span><i><span>GTA V</span></i><span> and </span><i><span>RDR II</span></i><span> server owners, the official news post states that “there’s something for every server and every player,” including “purchasable props, scripts, maps, and much more.”</span><span><br> </span><span><br> </span><span>The marketplace features a handful of mods that are free to download, as well as mods that require a </span><a href="https://marketplace.cfx.re/packages/6187491-onx-eup-police-ems-clothing-pack"><span>$23.99 recurring monthly fee</span></a><span> and bundles that cost </span><a href="https://marketplace.cfx.re/packages/6187491-onx-eup-police-ems-clothing-pack"><span>upwards of $467.99</span></a><span>. For the time being, Cfx has only partnered with a “select group” of modders for its initial launch. It’s also not clear exactly how much of a cut Take-Two Interactive is getting from these purchases.</span><span><br> </span><span><br> </span><span>It could be argued that the creation of the Cfx Marketplace is Rockstar Games’ attempt at providing a space for server owners to find mods that are immune to takedown notices, as, according to commenters on Cfx’s news post, dozens of paid, non-Rockstar-authorized mods have been banned in the past for featuring third-party assets.</span><span><br> </span><span><br> </span><span>The timing is also somewhat suspicious, as this “initial launch” looks a lot like a trial run for a </span><i><span>Grand Theft Auto VI</span></i><span> mod marketplace to me. I’d also be curious to find out exactly how much of a cut, if any, Rockstar Games and Take-Two are getting from these purchases, although said information is seemingly absent from any of the official Cfx Marketplace news posts.</span></p>
