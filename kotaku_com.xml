            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://kotaku.com/marvel-rivals-patch-notes-doctor-strange-portal-ult-1851717418<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Marvel Rivals </em>is just under a week old and has already got its first big patch. NetEase’s update doesn’t have any balance changes, instead being focused on bug fixes. However, there’s slight overlap, as one glitch the patch fixes effectively gives the Vanguard Doctor Strange a bit of a nerf. That’s because fans had discovered a way to immediately charge the Sorcerer Supreme’s ultimate ability to full with just one well-placed portal.</p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="197298" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="Live Forever in the Universe of 'New World: Aeternum'" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="108" data-playlist="197298,197284,197260" data-current="197298"><div><p>Live Forever in the Universe of 'New World: Aeternum'</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197298/197298_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197298/197298_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197298/197298_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197298/197298_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"></video></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>The <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.marvelrivals.com/gameupdate/20241210/41548_1199072.html&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.marvelrivals.com/gameupdate/20241210/41548_1199072.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">full patch notes</a></span> run down all the bugs and fixes squashed in the update, several of which are mundane things like players getting caught in a map’s geometry or graphical hitches. But the big one is a change to Doctor Strange’s ultimate charge that specifically addresses any environmental kills the character pulls off. A common strategy for Doctor Strange players is to create a portal in front of an enemy spawn room and have it open up above a hole on the map so your foes fall to their deaths. Due to an apparent glitch, this would boost Doctor Strange’s ultimate charge to nearly 100 percent.</p><p>As a temporary fix, NetEase is disabling the portals’ terrain kill attribution, meaning that the game will not register these deaths as Doctor Strange’s kills. As such, a Strange player will not receive any of the passive benefits like ult charge or scoreboard kills for this strategy. NetEase says it will be reinstating those benefits in a future update, but only after it has been able to address the ultimate charge bug. It’s a slight bummer, but portals are still effective in getting an easy team kill.</p><p>The full patch notes read as follows:</p><h2 id="h875250"><a id=""></a><strong><em>General</em></strong></h2><p><em>· When playing highlights and recordings, crosshair deviation would be significant, and there was a possibility for lag. This issue has been resolved.</em><br><em>· Changing where Highlights were saved would cause the game to crash. This issue has been resolved.</em><br><em>· Players joining a Quick Match as a replacement may not be able to see heroes’ equipped costumes. This issue has been resolved.</em><br><em>· Mission progress on the Season Event screen would not display correctly. This issue has been resolved.</em><br><em>· Fixed some textual errors. More fixes will be coming in a future update.</em><br><em>· After a crash, the game had a chance to freeze for a long period of time before closing. This issue has been resolved, and now the game will close after crashing.</em><br><em>· Fixed some relatively common crash issues. </em></p><h3 id="h875251"><a id=""></a><strong><em>Maps &amp; Game Modes</em></strong></h3><p><em>· On certain maps (particularly Hydra Charteris Base: Hell’s Heaven and Klyntar: Symbiotic Surface), special collisions on the edges would cause the player’s character to become stuck or clip through and enter strange areas. These issues have been largely resolved, but as this affects multiple maps and areas, this bug may be present elsewhere. We will work to continue fixing such issues and develop a solution to thoroughly prevent them.</em></p><p><em>· In the foggy areas of Intergalactic Empire of Wakanda: Hall of Djalia and Intergalactic Empire of Wakanda: Birnin T’Challa:</em><br><em> - Fog would disappear from Hela and Storm’s perspectives when they activated their Ultimates. This issue has been resolved.</em><br><em> - After Jeff the Land Shark was revived while in the fog, his teammates and enemies would not be able to see the special effects of Joyful Splash. This issue has been resolved.</em></p><p><em>· In Hydra Charteris Base: Hell’s Heaven - Frozen Airfield:</em><br><em> - In Competitive, if a player was KO’d while moving near a target area, it would cause the lightings to behave abnormally. This issue has been resolved.</em><br><em> - During matches, disconnecting and reconnecting could cause desynchronization of some doors (i.e., a door looked to be closed, but the player could walk through; a door looked to be open, but the player couldn’t walk through). This issue has been resolved.</em></p><p><em>· Hydra Charteris Base: Hell’s Heaven - Eldritch Monument:</em><br><em> - When the target area is ascending or descending, if Adam Warlock used his Ultimate, his teammates would potentially revive and be stuck beneath the terrain if they were right on the target area platform. This issue has been resolved.</em><br><em> - When the target area is ascending or descending, if Thor or Loki were revived by Hela’s team-up ability, they would potentially revive and be stuck beneath the terrain if they were right on the target area platform. This issue has been resolved.</em><br><em> - When the target area is ascending or descending, if Jeff the Land Shark used his Ultimate to devour characters, they would potentially become stuck beneath the terrain if they were right on the target area platform. This issue has been resolved.</em><br><em> - When the target area is ascending or descending, if Winter Soldier hit an enemy with his Ultimate and they landed right on the target area platform, damage may be lost. This issue has been resolved.</em></p><p><em>· When switching between rounds in Competitive, if the destination was not the last stage of a map, it would cause the vehicle’s effective range to not display when it approached the destination, impacting determination of the effective occupation range. This issue has been resolved.</em><br><em>· Upon reaching the third round in Competitive Convoy or Convergence, heroes had a chance to carry over their Ultimate energy from the second round. This issue has been resolved, and heroes will no longer inherit their Ultimate energy. </em></p><h3 id="h875252"><a id=""></a><strong><em>Heroes</em></strong></h3><p><em>· When Wolverine had his Deadpool &amp; Wolverine costume equipped, no ability voice lines other than the Undying Animal ability’s line would play. This issue has been resolved.</em><br><em>· After Star-Lord’s Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3's MVP animation played, sound effects would not be played in the results screen. This issue has been resolved.</em><br><em>· When Iron Fist used pings, the corresponding voice lines would not be triggered. This issue has been resolved.</em><br><em>· The description for ADS sensitivity in Black Widow’s settings was incorrect. This issue has been resolved.</em><br><em>· In certain situations, Black Widow’s Ultimate would not recover energy as intended. This issue has been resolved.</em><br><em>· In certain extreme situations, Captain America’s Ultimate wouldn’t end as intended. This issue has been resolved.</em><br><em>· When Doctor Strange’s portals triggered terrain KOs, they would mistakenly restore Doctor Strange’s Ultimate energy. For now, we have disabled the portals’ terrain KO attribution to temporarily fix this issue (i.e., terrain KOs will not count toward Doctor Strange’s own KOs). Rest assured, this bug will be resolved in a future update, at which time we will restore the portals’ KO attribution.</em></p><h2 id="h875253"><a id=""></a><strong><em>PC</em></strong></h2><p><em>· Using FSR 3 frame generation technology to modify the resolution could cause memory leaks, resulting in blurry models. This issue has been resolved.</em></p><h2 id="h875254"><a id=""></a><strong><em>Console</em></strong></h2><p><em>· After equipping the PlayStation bundle’s Scarlet Spider costume, restarting the game could cause the costume to not display as correctly equipped. This issue has been resolved.</em></p><p><em>We’ll be keeping an eye on the frequency of different bugs and fixing them as fast as we can.

You can spend dozens of hours in this new location making every meal, crafting every piece of furniture, and meeting plenty of new friends (both villagers and critters!). But learning how to get every item can be a process in itself. If you’re missing Broken Weapons and wondering how to get your hands on some, look no further.</p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="197298" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="Live Forever in the Universe of 'New World: Aeternum'" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="108" data-playlist="197298,197284,197260" data-current="197298"><div><p>Live Forever in the Universe of 'New World: Aeternum'</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197298/197298_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197298/197298_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197298/197298_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197298/197298_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"></video></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><h2 id="h870800"><a id=""></a>How to get Broken Weapons in <em>The Storybook Vale</em></h2><p>Getting a Broken Weapon in <em>The Storybook Vale</em> isn’t a particularly difficult task, but it can take quite a while to build up a nice collection of the crafting material. That’s because <strong>you can only get Broken Weapons by digging in one of the four areas of the Mythopia biome</strong>.</p><p>Unfortunately, digging is one of <em>Disney Dreamlight Valley</em>’s most tedious jobs, so you’ll be spending a lot of time just holding down your interact button as you watch your character dig holes. And since Broken Weapons share drop rates with coins and other materials that can be found while digging, you could get drops back-to-back or not see a single Broken Weapon after digging 20 times. </p><p>Because of this frustrating drop rate, you’ll thank yourself later if you bring along a digging companion who can make sure you get an extra Broken Weapon each time you find one. This will literally double the speed of your grind.</p><figure id="" data-id="0f30e28a14039457f2d9bc36064a196a" data-recommend-id="image://0f30e28a14039457f2d9bc36064a196a" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A screenshot of Disney Dreamlight Valley's menu system shows the character's present inventory." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A screenshot of Disney Dreamlight Valley's menu system shows the character's present inventory." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Disney / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="0f30e28a14039457f2d9bc36064a196a" data-recommend-id="image://0f30e28a14039457f2d9bc36064a196a" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A screenshot of Disney Dreamlight Valley's menu system shows the character's present inventory." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Additionally, you can pair this task with building up your collection of cooking ingredients. Snag around 50 of each type of seed in <em>The Storybook Vale</em> and then dig for as long as you need to to score the amount of Broken Weapons you’d like. Afterward, plant and water all of those seeds.</p><p>Two birds, one stone! Now you have plenty of Broken Weapons <em>and</em> a solid start on getting all of the dishes made in your meals collection.</p><p>You’ll definitely want to keep at it and find as many Broken Weapons as you can, as this crafting material serves as an important part of finishing your crafting collection in <em>The Storybook Vale</em> as well. Plus, some of the furniture you can make with the item is pretty cool, and you wouldn’t want to miss out.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Everywhere you look the genre is growing, evolving, and dominating. From Japanese-style RPGs to Western-style ones, retro remakes to open-world sequels, there’s never been more to dig into for fans of exploration, branching dialogue, or just making the numbers go up.</p><p>This year saw the release of ambitious blockbuster RPGs iterating on tried-and-true formulas as well as bold mashups borrowing from the genres’ best to create something new and equally satisfying. The games were also long, from nearly 15 hours to over 65. Finishing every game on this list by focusing on the critical paths alone would take you roughly 513.5 hours, or about three months of treating them like full-time jobs. But of course the real delight of most RPGs is taking your time, exploring every last NPC conversation and dead-end path in a leisurely fashion until you’ve seen everything the game has to offer. And the following games offered a lot. </p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="6aaf323f78be36f4e2ee287738a57a2f" data-recommend-id="image://6aaf323f78be36f4e2ee287738a57a2f" data-format="png" data-width="1849" data-height="1040" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Pixel art sprites walk along a sunset.

I was utterly dazzled by their visuals but, in my estimation at least, they failed to actually capture the spirit of the games to which they were so reverently paying homage. But finally, Square Enix has nailed it by thoughtfully applying the HD-2D aesthetic to one of the actual masterpieces of the pixel art era, <em>Dragon Quest III</em>. The result is one of the best JRPGs of all time, given extraordinary new life through a visual treatment that respects the look and world design of the original game but makes that world newly wondrous to behold, popping with depth, tactility, light and shadow. It’s one of many RPG remakes this year that preserves what makes the original so terrific, enhancing visuals or other elements in such a way that newcomers and longtime fans alike can experience (or re-experience) these exceptional games in a way that feels fresh, contemporary, and alive. — Carolyn Petit</p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="55c9856e7416822f99c2e438042a40a0" data-recommend-id="image://55c9856e7416822f99c2e438042a40a0" data-format="png" data-width="1200" data-height="675" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="A tourist looks out at beautiful mountains.

It mixes a contemporary setting with magic and monsters to create an oddly cozy action RPG that is hard to put down thanks to how it constantly builds on itself. The way <em>Hinterberg</em> is structured also helps as it forces you to interact with all of its systems, including the ability to develop friendships with other characters and explore its large maps filled with goblins, treasure, loot, and dungeons. By the end of <em>Hinterberg</em>, I was sad to be finished with it, but happy that I got to experience one of the best RPGs of 2024. — Zack Zwiezen </p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="538dc3eadf3f8337b5193512b188759f" data-recommend-id="image://538dc3eadf3f8337b5193512b188759f" data-format="png" data-width="1536" data-height="864" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="A lion man slays a dragon.

The game is split up into discrete missions designed to be endlessly replayed as you chase better scores, rewards, and end-game resources, and I can’t say the story left a very deep impression on me beyond the broad strokes of its heroic saga about fighting the evil empire and the powerful magic forces maneuvering beneath its surface. And that’s all fine. It nails the vibes and has a grand sense of  scale, all while not getting in the way of the main attraction: big boss fights with slick and rewarding real-time action combat complete with MMO-like party synergies. — Ethan Gach</p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="1b8cc9ecdea1ee59db03fb27a7c05202" data-recommend-id="image://1b8cc9ecdea1ee59db03fb27a7c05202" data-format="jpg" data-width="3840" data-height="2160" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Adventurers head into a magical forest.

I’ve been waiting for a sequel to live up to the series’ SNES-era hype ever since. <em>Visions of Mana</em> is not a top-three <em>Mana</em> game, but it’s still a surprisingly good one. Solid combat and a vibrant if somewhat empty open world are propelled to the next level by wonderful music, old-school dungeons, and a great class-based progression system. <em>Visions of Mana</em>’s uniquely whimsical world was a breath of fresh air that reminded me how much more there can be to modern RPGs than grim sci-fi dystopias, modern schoolyard grinds, and classic medieval dragon slaying. It’s a shame the team behind it, NetEase’s Ouka Studio, was shut down as soon as the game shipped, but I’m hopeful it’s not the last we’ll see of this new era of <em>Mana</em> after the game’s director, Ryosuke Yoshida, joined Square Enix this month. — Ethan Gach</p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="6c2a8e38c71469c37918a7f4a2453cc7" data-recommend-id="image://6c2a8e38c71469c37918a7f4a2453cc7" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Mario and a bunch of Yoshis fight on stage.

Like a modern auto chess reimagining of <em>Ogre Battle</em>, <em>Unicorn Overlord</em> takes Vanillaware’s flashy art style and applies it to a dense medieval political epic that plays out across slick 2D battles and top-down real-time strategy maps.

It eschews the fantasy settings that dominated the genre then (and the sci-fi ones, too—I didn’t forget about you, <em>Phantasy Star</em>) for its own distinctive world, one with archetypes and imagery rooted in Westerns but with some horror-adjacent elements as well. Of course, there are the monsters and demons running rampant in the world, but there’s also the fact that the world’s currency is teeth, a detail which continually unnerved me across my ~15 hours with the game.</p><p>I’ve seen people complain that <em>Grimstone </em>is “poorly designed,” they feel, because it doesn’t tell you what the different items you find throughout do. That’s a valid argument, I suppose, but part of what I loved about <em>Grimstone</em>—and indeed, about <em>UFO 50 </em>in its entirety—was the way I was encouraged to experiment, to push up against the limitations of games and see what the rules of their different worlds were. It’s a type of discovery that once felt common in games—many people my age, I think, know the feeling of encountering an opaque game on a relative’s computer, or being left alone with grandpa’s Intellivision—but that’s become increasingly rare as more and more games build thorough instructions into the games themselves rather than expecting you to keep a manual on hand. That sense of progress and discovery never flagged during my time with <em>Grimstone</em>—finding each new town where I could rest at the inn was always a huge relief; conquering each new dungeon was always a thrill; scoring cool new weapons and spells was always a great reward for my efforts. And while <em>Grimstone</em>’s storytelling is fairly minimal by today’s standards, discovering the truth about its world was exciting, particularly because that world is so distinct from the worlds of the actual 1980s JRPGs I’ve played. Not unlike my time with <em>Final Fantasy I</em>’s pixel remaster a few years back, playing <em>Grimstone </em>was a terrific reminder that distilling the genre down to its fundamental essence and giving us just enough detail for our imaginations to do most of the work of bringing a world to life can still be a wonderfully captivating approach for a role-playing game. — Carolyn Petit </p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="30a5312e1ab3f2f9c623f389e2f48d33" data-recommend-id="image://30a5312e1ab3f2f9c623f389e2f48d33" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Warriors take on dragons in Wizardry." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Warriors take on dragons in Wizardry." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Digital Eclipse</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="30a5312e1ab3f2f9c623f389e2f48d33" data-recommend-id="image://30a5312e1ab3f2f9c623f389e2f48d33" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Warriors take on dragons in Wizardry." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>Oh, what a glorious remake. In 1981, <em>Wizardry: Proving Grounds of the Mad Overlord </em>was released and changed gaming forever, with its deadly monsters and devious dungeons helping to establish the template for party-based computer role-playing. Still, important as it was, it was hard to go back to that game today; at the time, players’ eager imaginations would fill in the gaps of its wire-frame dungeons, but nowadays, those primitive visuals and the game’s many other inconveniences stood between most players and the excitement and cultural impact of Sir-Tech’s masterpiece.</p><p>Enter Digital Eclipse, who knew exactly what to enhance and what to leave alone in bringing <em>PGotMO </em>into the modern era. Transparently built right on top of the original game, this remake brings the dungeons and monsters to vibrant life with lush, atmospheric 3D visuals and terrific sound effects, while also implementing a slew of quality-of-life improvements that cut down on needless frustration while preserving the original game’s vision and difficulty. In the 40+ years since <em>Wizardry</em>’s release, storytelling in role-playing games has evolved tremendously, but playing it this year reminded me that there’s still no substitute for the thrill of delving ever-deeper into a deadly dungeon, enduring hardship and defeat on the road to conquering its traps and defeating its monsters, and making up a story in your own head about the party of heroes you’ve created to tackle it all. — Carolyn Petit </p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="03a44d406d642f689680c468eafbe108" data-recommend-id="image://03a44d406d642f689680c468eafbe108" data-format="png" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="A warrior holds up her hands in front of a statue.

With a compelling gangster narrative, fantastic characters, and a thoroughly engaging turn-based combat system, <em>Infinite Wealth</em> is easily one of the must-play RPGs of 2024.</p><p>Though having knowledge of previous <em>Yakuza</em> games will certainly give you some great context, <em>Infinite Wealth</em> tells a focused story you can appreciate even if it’s your first foray into the series. With a plot centered on protagonist Ichiban Kasuga’s search to meet his long-lost mother, as well as on co-protagonist Kazuma Kiryu’s last days as he succumbs to cancer, the narratives in <em>Infinite Wealth</em> are grounded and intriguing. And despite covering such serious ground as estranged family relationships and terminal illness, <em>Infinite Wealth</em> is never afraid to dive into hilarious absurdities, such as a pet crawfish’s search for love. The game also features a ton of mini-games that are naturally embedded in the top-level gameplay, including an entire island-resort management game.</p><p><em>Infinite Wealth </em>tells rewarding stories of relatable human experiences with dozens of hours of engaging side-activities that rarely burden you with busywork. If you tire of fantastical settings that feel too detached from reality and instead want to follow the sometimes-goofy trials and tribulations of troubled-yet-endearing characters trying to make the best of their difficult lives, <em>Infinite Wealth </em>needs to be on your list if it isn’t already. — Claire Jackson</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="b2819f83de7a026a9db026167e6a88bc" data-recommend-id="image://b2819f83de7a026a9db026167e6a88bc" data-format="jpg" data-width="2946" data-height="1656" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Cloud and co. look out at the prison in Corel.

The second chapter in Square Enix’s retelling of its 1997 PS1 hit, it’s way too long and crammed with way too much filler. The endless minigames, distractions, side-shows, and routine overindulgences don’t always hit, but when they do, it makes <em>Rebirth</em> feel like it’s more alive and having more fun than almost any other game other there. Some RPGs are better than the sum of their parts. <em>Rebirth</em> is an epic slog that nevertheless manages to be more interesting, bold, and unforgettable than the average of its many highs and  lows. It’s big-budget gorgeous yet still unabashedly absurd and over-the-top at any opportunity it gets. — Ethan Gach </p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
