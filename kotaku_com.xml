Worried that juggling menus and harvesting laundry lists of arcane animal parts sounds too overwhelming and boring? Fear not! <em>Monster Hunter Wilds</em> lets you (mostly) make the experience as simple or as complicated as you want. Dive in deep and get your hands dirty with the game’s myriad interlocking crafting and skill systems, <em>or </em>just hop onto your Seikret steed, bee-line for the next boss, and have a fun time whacking it until it falls over. The choice is yours. But no matter how you decide to play, here are a bunch of helpful tips for getting started in <em>Monster Hunter Wilds</em>.</p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="196742" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="What Is Dragonsplague?

I have been using it ever since, and love how heavy it feels and seeing those big damage numbers it puts up with each hit. But you might hate it. There are 14 weapons and it’s worth playing around with a few of them to see which actually feels best for you and your playstyle. </p><p>Each weapon is its own character in Monster Hunter Wilds, and learning all of its advantages, weaknesses, and quirks is a massive part of the game, like the difference between picking Ryu or Blanka in <em>Street Fighter</em>. I recommend against the Sword and Shield because blocking is boring. The Dual Blades, on the other hand, are lightning-quick and make fights feel like you’re shredding cabbage. Plus, they have a really cool Focus Strike animation. </p><h2 id="h66761"><a id=""></a>Make your secondary weapon a long-range one to start</h2><p>You can equip a second weapon and pull it out of your saddlebag mid-fight whenever you want. While the sky’s the limit for what kind of synergies come from this in the end game, it never hurts to make your secondary weapon long-range in case you need to shift up tactics or play more conservatively late into a fight. I like the Heavy Bowgun. It’s like shooting a rifle and has a nice burst option. </p><h2 id="h66762"><a id=""></a>Never hunt on an empty stomach</h2><p>Meals in <em>Monster Hunter Wilds</em> don’t give you bonuses so much as necessary buffs that become the foundation for each hunt you go on. There’s a handy list that will show you what stats your current ingredients will give you, with the main ones being health and stamina recovery. The great thing about cooking in the latest entry is that you can do it wherever you want, including right next to other monsters. Buy ingredients from vendors in your camp or pick them up on your way to the next hunt. </p><figure id="" data-id="d987fa326fd570000e625a1906bf8a02" data-recommend-id="image://d987fa326fd570000e625a1906bf8a02" data-format="jpg" data-width="1900" data-height="1068" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A village gives a gift to a Palico.

" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><h2 id="h66763"><a id=""></a>Don’t worry too much about exploring until you’ve rolled credits</h2><p><em>Monster Hunter Wilds</em> is one of those games that doesn’t really get started until after it’s over. “Rolling credits” will happen at the end of the main campaign, but there are still more story quests that follow after that. This is the “late game,” which includes high-rank monsters and gear. This is when the game really opens up and exploration feels more natural and rewarding. Plus, all the rewards you get for your troubles are much more worthwhile. And personally, I think <em>Monster Hunter Wilds</em>’ base campaign is best played in as much of a straight shot as possible. The pacing is pretty breakneck with one big fight after another, culminating in some neat narrative reveals and a cool “final” boss fight. </p><h2 id="h66764"><a id=""></a>Make the SOS flare automatic if you’re tired of fighting alone</h2><p>SOS flares are what let other characters join your hunt. Shooting one up can either be manual or you can change the settings in the multiplayer menu to make it automatic at the start of each new hunt. While it can be fun and challenging to fight alone, it’s also good, and often much faster, to fight with a full squad of four. And if you don’t want to play with other humans, you can keep that party solely consisting of AI-controlled NPCs from the main story. They’ll heal you and do a decent job of taking aggro from monsters. </p><h2 id="h66765"><a id=""></a>Your  Seikret is you most powerful secret weapon</h2><p>The new mounts in <em>Monster Hunter Wilds</em> are called Seikrets. They don’t fight, but they will rapidly autopilot you through dense and confusing environments by simply pressing up on the D-pad. Normally, the end destination is whatever monster you’re hunting, but you can also select icons from the map and set them as waypoints to give the Seikret new directions. </p><p>They’re also extremely useful in fights. You can whistle for them to pick you up after getting knocked down. They’re a great way to build distance between you and a monster, or get out of the way of a big attack. Their saddlebags are also full of items to restock your supplies (left on the D-pad), including your secondary weapon (right on the D-pad). Most importantly, you can spring and then lunge off their back and press your heavy attack to hit monsters with aerial attacks, which is super fun. </p><figure id="" data-id="66916293bd220b2f52152f2b707d0f72" data-recommend-id="image://66916293bd220b2f52152f2b707d0f72" data-format="jpg" data-width="1900" data-height="1068" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Two hunters ride their mounts.

" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><h2 id="h66766"><a id=""></a>Make inventory shortcuts for potions and traps</h2><p>One of the biggest pitfalls of Monster Hunter remains its cumbersome item menus. There’s nothing like getting stomped while trying to tab over from your first aid kids to your antidotes. Luckily, you can pick a handful of the most useful items, like your whetstone (gotta keep those weapons sharp!), electric traps, and potions, to equip as shortcuts in a radial menu. It’s still not the best, but a heck of a lot faster and easier than the regular inventory menu. </p><h2 id="h66767"><a id=""></a>Focus your attacks and pop wounds for maximum damage</h2><p><em>Monster Hunter Wilds</em> introduces a system called Focus that lets you hold down the left trigger to aim attacks or stab wounds to initiate Focus Strikes. These do lots of damage and are really satisfying to watch. They all break off extra monster parts for crafting that immediate get added to your inventory. To open up wounds you need to hit the same spots on a monster repeatedly. Once open, don’t waste time closing ’em up. The resulting Focus Strikes also knock the monster off balance, turning the best offense into a great defense as well. </p><h2 id="h66768"><a id=""></a>Always be climbing on those monsters’ backs</h2><p>Jumping off a higher platform or lunging from your Seikret and doing an aerial attack will occasionally pop you onto a monster’s back. Once there, you can stab to open a wound and move up and down its back to avoid being shaken off as your stamina depletes. When the screen starts to go dark you should hold the right trigger to hold on. Once you’ve got a few wounds opened up you can do a Focus Strike before getting thrown off. You’ll have to keep doing more aerial attacks to build up an invisible gauge before you can hop back on again. </p><h2 id="h66769"><a id=""></a>Don’t bother with crafting low ranking armor and weapons</h2><p>The natural loop of <em>Monster Hunter</em> is kill stuff to make stuff, and the pull of crafting new gear is strong. However, the actual stuff you can craft early on in <em>Wilds</em> is not. You can get through much of the first 15 hours of the game with just a couple sets of new armor and one or two upgrades to your main weapon. I’d recommend saving the rest of your resources for crafting high-rank gear once you’re in the late game. But definitely treat yourself once or twice over the main campaign to some cool looking armor which will then make you look extra ridiculous in all of the bespoke cutscenes.</p><figure id="" data-id="6c4be19b8cd169c6a09d0d8c8a2b5398" data-recommend-id="image://6c4be19b8cd169c6a09d0d8c8a2b5398" data-format="jpg" data-width="1900" data-height="1068" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Sandworms attack a hunter.

" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><h2 id="h66770"><a id=""></a>Capturing monsters instead of killing them can save time</h2><p>You don’t actually have to kill everything in <em>Monster Hunter Wilds</em>. You can capture your quarry instead. You’ll get basically the same items for doing so and while more complex, it can actually save time. That’s because you can capture a monster and subdue long before it’s actually dead. To do that, you just have to wait until it’s damaged enough that a skull icon appears next to it, at which point you can temporarily disable it with a shock or pitfall trap and then put it to sleep with a couple of tranquilizer bombs. This can be especially useful if you’ve already died a few times and are at risk of losing the entire hunt. </p><h2 id="h66771"><a id=""></a>Learn how to pause the game</h2><p>Hitting the options button doesn’t pause <em>Monster Hunter Wilds</em>, but that doesn’t mean the game can’t be paused. Instead, the pause button is hidden on a separate set of menus. Fortunately, you can select it and equip it to your quick action radial menu making it easy to pause without your character being left vulnerable. And don’t worry if you have to leave the game for a while. Instead of kicking you back to the main menu, you’ll simply be taken offline but your game will remain uninterrupted (which is great for suspended games and quick resume). What a novel idea!</p><h2 id="h66772"><a id=""></a>That glowing red line means the monster is about to kill you</h2><p>You might notice that when you’re health gets low a bright red glowing line appears between you and the monster that you’re hunting. That’s the game’s way of telling you that it’s next attack, if it hits, will “cart you,” i.e. sent you back to camp. When this happens you should a) get the hell out of the way, and b) heal up as fast as possible. </p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

For example, if you want to buy <em>Family Guy: Back to the Multiverse</em>, you’d need to shell out $50. And these codes only work for people living in the United States. But hey, if you’ve been wanting a digital copy of<em> Marvel Ultimate Alliance</em> on PC, this is probably your best (and cheapest) option. </p><p>I do wonder how long this will last. I assume these are just old codes that Amazon has in its digital inventory and once the codes run out, that will be that. For some less popular  games, it could take a long time for PC codes to dry up. But I’d expect that <em>Deadpool </em>and other highly sought after Steam games will go fast, especially as these codes could be resold. So don’t wait too long to buy any of these delisted PC games or you might miss out. </p><p> .<br></p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Sure, it might seem like the most counter-cultural act imaginable amidst these late-stage capitalism end-of-days horrors, but the very internet on which you’re reading these words wouldn’t exist without it. The games you play depend on it. It’s the very core of art itself. So, it’s generally a pretty good thing when games industry people remember this. Speaking of which, EA just made the code for the first four <em>Command &amp; Conquer</em> games officially open source.</p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="196653" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="The Week In Games: A Star Wars Classic Returns &amp; More New Releases" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="105" data-playlist="196653,196663,194143" data-current="196653"><div><p>The Week In Games: A Star Wars Classic Returns &amp; More New Releases</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196653/196653_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196653/196653_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196653/196653_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196653/196653_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/22209.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>You may, as someone possibly young enough to have been untroubled by the <em>Command &amp; Conquer</em> games in their heyday, see this as a relatively minor act. It’s really, <em>really</em> not. And if we’re going to be fiercely critical of EA when it does horrible things, it’s also crucial that we celebrate when the publisher does something this important.</p><p>Two primers. <strong>Firstly, <em>Command &amp; Conquer</em></strong>, or <em>C&amp;C</em> as it’s mostly known to its adoring fanbase. These were a series of utterly superb real-time strategy games, sometimes the best in the medium,  gloriously loved in part for their kitschy full-motion video cutscenes. The first game, in 1995, sold <em>three million copies </em>in a time before games really did that, and that was despite its FMV sequences starring members of the development team in the lowest-budget way imaginable.</p><p>As the series went on, these cutscenes began to star some really big names, the likes of James Earl Jones, J.K. Simmons, George Takei, Tim Curry, Jonathan Pryce, and—uh-oh—Gina Carano. The release of a new entry was always a big deal, with gaming magazines inevitably plastering them over front pages and  reviews so frequently glowing. So while the name “<em>Command &amp; Conquer</em>” may not mean so much in 2025, 17 years after the last decent game in the series—<em>Red Alert 3</em>—it remains one of the most significant franchises in gaming history.</p><p><strong>Secondly, source codes.</strong> Any game being made publicly available for free (as in: yours to keep, copy, share forever) is to be celebrated, in an industry that usually so spitefully clings on to long-dead IPs that it refuses to sell, but still employs lawyers to prevent being accessible. But releasing a game’s source code is next level. This is not the game itself, as in a thing to boot up and play, but rather the flesh and bones that makes the game exist. It’s <em>all the secrets</em>. It offers developers the ability to see exactly how a game was put together, read all the hilariously botched bits of code the devs strung together in desperation to get a game out the door, and learn how the best in the business constructed their games.</p><p>Very few games publishers ever allow access to a game’s source code, even if they’re willing to let a game be freely shared. It’s not always possible—code is lost or difficult to put all in one place, and licenses can be nightmarish. But even when it is easily doable, it’s still a rarity. Often this is simply because developers are desperately embarrassed, horrified at the idea of their peers learning just how precariously held together their code proves to be, even though that’s the case for absolutely everyone else’s work too! Also, people are shitty, and there’s always grim hostility as code is judged by people who couldn’t do better. Sometimes it’s because sharing source code can give people the impression that you’re also now available for tech support, there to answer every question about every detail, and no one wants or needs that. But too often it’s because of a belief that these are industry secrets, precious treasures that must be sat upon for all of time lest a rival do something so inhumanly awful as <em>copy</em>.</p><p>So, given all this context, this move by EA is really significant, and incredibly welcome. Because going “open source” is even bigger than has already been suggested. Publishing the code under <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-3.0.en.html&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-3.0.en.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">the GPL license</a></span> means that absolutely anybody is now allowed to take that code, make even minor changes to it, and then sell it for profit! Clearly, not many would pay for such low-effort output, but that’s the core of the principle here. It’s the same basis on which Linux distributions are published, along with all the free software that runs on it. It’s free, open code, there for the wider public to learn from, adapt, and reinterpret.</p><p>The four games now having their code published under the GPL are <em>Command &amp; Conquer</em>, <em>C&amp;C: Red Alert</em>, <em>C&amp;C: Renegade</em> (a first-person shooter!), and <em>C&amp;C: Generals</em>.</p><p>EA isn’t alone here, of course. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://github.com/id-software&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://github.com/id-software" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">id Software was known for many years</a></span> for publishing the source code for its games a few years after release. (Unfortunately  id, now owned by Microsoft, doesn’t seem to have any interest in continuing the trend.) Epic, another company built in the ‘90s on principles of shareware and shared code, also releases <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://github.com/RedPandaProjects/UnrealEngine&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://github.com/RedPandaProjects/UnrealEngine" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">older versions of the Unreal Engine</a></span>, as well as games like <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/unreal-engine-epic-free-internet-archive-fortnite-1851698320&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/unreal-engine-epic-free-internet-archive-fortnite-1851698320"><em>Unreal </em>and <em>Unreal Tournament</em></a></span>.</p><p>What makes this <em>Command &amp; Conquer </em>move quite so striking is that it’s EA doing it. They’re not exactly a company known for, let’s say, loving acts of kindness. In more recent years, the publisher has become synonymous with the lowest aspects of video gaming, from forcing its games to be played with an internet connection before the era of widely-available broadband, to gacha awfulness with its gambling-adjacent loot boxes. In fact, the <em>C&amp;C</em> name itself was run into the ground until it was all but worthless after EA forced in always-on DRM to hastily made sequels and released terrible free-to-play mobile versions. </p><figure id="" data-id="153d4b128504c7b43e0f0a231c9a3b46" data-recommend-id="image://153d4b128504c7b43e0f0a231c9a3b46" data-format="jpg" data-width="1022" data-height="575" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The battle map, covered in fire, from C&amp;C Generals." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="The battle map, covered in fire, from C&amp;C Generals." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->EA / Mobygames / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="153d4b128504c7b43e0f0a231c9a3b46" data-recommend-id="image://153d4b128504c7b43e0f0a231c9a3b46" data-format="jpg" data-width="1022" data-height="575" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The battle map, covered in fire, from C&amp;C Generals." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>But, soft! What light through yonder window breaks? Is this a crack in their tough, outer veneer? A sign of a future EA that is interested in games preservation, and the open and free sharing of intellectual property from which it no longer has a means to meaningfully profit? Because dear God, I hope so.</p><p>And I hope other publishers sit up and take notice about how we’re all now making cooing noises and scratching EA under its chin, rather than simply scowling at it. This should be normal! It’s essentially free to a publisher—you just stick the source code on Github and eat your lumps. Somehow one of the most controversial things I ever wrote was suggesting that <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/editorial-why-games-should-enter-the-public-domain&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/editorial-why-games-should-enter-the-public-domain" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">games should go into the public domain a full 20 years after their first release</a></span>, despite this seeming like the most sensible, industry-boosting action possible, at a point when publishers are no longer making real money from the original versions. OK, so in the case of most the games being made available here, we’re talking closer to 30 years. But I’ll take it!</p><p>So come on, everyone! A revolution! EA, give us the source code for <em>Sim City 2000</em>! LucasFilm, hand over <em>Day of the Tentacle</em>! Activision, share <em>MechWarrior 2</em> with everyone! Just imagine the learning resources that could be out there, the archive of code for the most important games of past generations, and the absolute assurance of their preservation for the future.</p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
