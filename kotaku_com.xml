At the time I blamed it on technical limitations and a focus on zombie-filled wastelands, and the lack of good dinosaur games made me really sad. So I’m happy to report that in 2025 we have a bunch of new dinosaur games to get excited about, and not all of them are <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/jurassic-world-rebirth-trailer-every-dinosaur-mutant-1851755947&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/jurassic-world-rebirth-trailer-every-dinosaur-mutant-1851755947"><em>Jurassic Park</em>-related</a></span>. </p><p>Just yesterday,<span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/future-games-showcase-2025-trailers-painkiller-1851771551&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/future-games-showcase-2025-trailers-painkiller-1851771551"> during the Spring Future Games Show</a></span>, another new dinosaur game was announced: <em>Deathground</em>, a co-op survival horror game featuring dangerous dinos. And it’s just one of many upcoming games that look to be trying to fill the <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/capcom-survey-dino-crisis-sequel-remake-onimusha-okami-1851235768?_gl=1*1rb6268*_ga*MTc0MjY2NTg1OS4xNzQwMzc1OTc4*_ga_V4QNJTT5L0*MTc0MjU4NjY3MS4yMi4xLjE3NDI1ODc0MzMuNTguMC4w&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/capcom-survey-dino-crisis-sequel-remake-onimusha-okami-1851235768?_gl=1*1rb6268*_ga*MTc0MjY2NTg1OS4xNzQwMzc1OTc4*_ga_V4QNJTT5L0*MTc0MjU4NjY3MS4yMi4xLjE3NDI1ODc0MzMuNTguMC4w">creepy, <em>Dino Crisis</em>-shaped void</a></span> that currently exists because Capcom won’t remake or develop a new entry in the franchise. </p><p>So let’s take a look at some of the potentially awesome dinosaur games coming to a video game console or PC near you. (Oh and spoilers, but none of the games listed in here have release dates, so who knows how long we’ll have to wait to play them.)</p></div></div><div><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/jurassic-park-survival-fps-action-trailer-game-awards-1851083053&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/jurassic-park-survival-fps-action-trailer-game-awards-1851083053">Announced back in 2023</a></span>, <em>Jurassic Park: Survival</em> is an upcoming first-person survival horror game being developed by Saber Interactive. Since its announcement we’ve not heard or seen much else about the project, but we know it’s still in the works. Let’s hope this game is better than <em>Trespasser</em>.</p></div><div><p>Set to be published by Annapurna Interactive, <em>The Lost Wild</em> is also a first-person survival horror game set on a jungle-covered island filled with hungry dinosaurs and abandoned science facilities. The trailers we’ve seen for this upcoming dino game look amazing, and if it plays as well as it looks we might be in for a terrifying treat.</p></div><div><p>Stop me if you’ve heard this before. <em> Compound Fracture</em> is a spooky first-person game featuring dinosaurs and dilapidated facilities where questionable science took place. However, unlike the other games on this list, <em>Compound Fracture</em> is designed to look and play more like a 1990s game, complete with some lovely looking low res textures. I’m very excited to see more of this indie game in the future.</p></div><div><p>This is the most recently announced game on our list and while it has some similarities to  the other dinosaur games we’ve looked at, including its FPS perspective and focus on horror, <em>Deathground </em>will support online co-op. Also, the dinosaurs in this upcoming survival horror multiplayer game have feathers. I’ll let you decide how you feel about that.</p></div><div><p>While many of the games on this list are directly inspired by <em>Jurassic Park </em>and its lush tropical jungles, <em>Paleophage </em>is clearly riffing on recent <em>Resident Evil</em> remakes with its more urban setting and third-person camera. That sounds great to me! If this game is half as good as the recent <em>RE4 </em>remake and also has dinosaurs in it, I’ll be perfectly satisfied.</p></div><div><p>Not every upcoming dinosaur game is a survival horror adventure. Take <em>Turok Origins</em>, which was announced in <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/turok-origins-new-game-saber-space-marine-third-person-1851720969&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/turok-origins-new-game-saber-space-marine-third-person-1851720969">December 2024</a></span> and looks to be a co-op third-person shooter set in the strange prehistoric alien universe of <em>Turok</em>. It’s being developed by the company behind S<em>pace Marine 2.</em></p></div><div><p>Published by TinyBuild, <em>Ferocious </em>is described by its devs as an old-school, action-packed FPS set on a tropical island inhabited by dangerous mercs and even more dangerous dinos. Simple premise, but the game basically looks like <em>Far Cry </em>+ dinosaurs and that’s a formula that has me excited to play. </p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

No microtransactions or in-game ads, but also fewer indie games. It’s part of a five-year plan for Netflix to find its own <em>Roblox-</em> or <em>Fortnite</em>-style killer app for games. This is apparently supposed to be a more focused approach than the company has employed in the last few years, though the genres Netflix is doubling down on—party games, kids games, narrative games, and “<span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2025-03-21/netflix-bets-big-on-video-games-with-broad-new-strategy?accessToken=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJzb3VyY2UiOiJTdWJzY3JpYmVyR2lmdGVkQXJ0aWNsZSIsImlhdCI6MTc0MjU4MTU3NiwiZXhwIjoxNzQzMTg2Mzc2LCJhcnRpY2xlSWQiOiJTVEhKQ1hUMVVNMFcwMCIsImJjb25uZWN0SWQiOiJCMUVBQkI5NjQ2QUM0REZFQTJBRkI4MjI1MzgyQTJFQSJ9.VZx8gM80oDX7KjpZMcJAJ2GK6rxt9jxVkJwglmYJ8Fc&amp;sref=P6Q0mxvj&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2025-03-21/netflix-bets-big-on-video-games-with-broad-new-strategy?accessToken=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJzb3VyY2UiOiJTdWJzY3JpYmVyR2lmdGVkQXJ0aWNsZSIsImlhdCI6MTc0MjU4MTU3NiwiZXhwIjoxNzQzMTg2Mzc2LCJhcnRpY2xlSWQiOiJTVEhKQ1hUMVVNMFcwMCIsImJjb25uZWN0SWQiOiJCMUVBQkI5NjQ2QUM0REZFQTJBRkI4MjI1MzgyQTJFQSJ9.VZx8gM80oDX7KjpZMcJAJ2GK6rxt9jxVkJwglmYJ8Fc&amp;sref=P6Q0mxvj" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">mainstream</a></span>” games—suggest this is more of a “we’ll know it when we see it” type of thing. </p><p>I’m skeptical that anything will be different this time around, if only because it still seems like the mandate to make great games is hemmed in by Netflix’s existing business model. The subscription service is essentially a bundle, but it’s trying to grow games like it’s a platform. You can understand why Netflix would be keen to get games running natively on smart TVs, or streamed to them, where it doesn’t have to pay Apple a 30 percent App Store fee. </p><p>But smartphones as controllers can be extremely limiting. Surely Netflix will have to start making its own gaming controller at some point, right? And at that point you’re half way to being a game console anyway. What’s the point of keeping your games off of PlayStation 5 and Switch 2 when other companies (Microsoft) are rushing to go multiplatform? The most popular games—<em>Fortnite</em>, <em>Roblox</em>, <em>Genshin Impact</em>—are on (almost) everything. This is why I’m so curious to see <em>Spirit Crossing</em> in action. Maybe Netflix is finally onto something, or maybe it’s still trying to pound a square peg into a round hole. </p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
