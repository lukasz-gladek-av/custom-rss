              <p>When you get invited to an exclusive event, usually you’re the one who’s expected to come bearing gifts. But with Costco’s invitation to join their Gold Star club for just $65, which gets you a year of access to incredible savings across all of their huge array of departments, you’re the one receiving the gift in the form of a $40 gift card. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5025/">The invitation is waiting for you now at StackSocial.&nbsp;</a></p>
<p>If your one-stop shopping ambitions are even greater, so are the rewards. <strong>StackSocial is offering a year’s membership to Costco’s Executive Gold Star club, where you get all of the access and benefits of Gold Star membership plus a 2% annual reward on all of your purchases, for just $130</strong>. That one comes with a $60 gift card, so you get nearly half of your membership fee back instantly.</p>

<h2>Members Only</h2>
<p>A membership is the only way to get in the door at any of Costco’s 635 locations nationwide, but when the membership fee is marked down so significantly and delivered with a gift card to be used on your first shopping trip, it’s more than worth it. Whether you go in person or shop online, Costco is the ultimate in one-stop shopping, with everything from fresh groceries, meat, and fish to clothes for men, women, and kids, with literally hundreds of other goods and services in between.</p>
<p>A trip to Costco can replace your trips to the grocery store, big-box electronics store, hardware store, bakery, liquor store, drugstore, and more. Then, of course, there is the legendary Costco food court, where the $1.50 all-beef hot dog and 20 oz drink deal has not changed price in years. And before you gas up the car for your Costco trip, remember that Costco membership also gets you access to the dramatically reduced gas prices at Costco’s own pumps.</p>



<h2>More Than Merchandise</h2>
<p>Costco’s deals on merchandise and groceries are amazing, but so are their deals on services you wouldn’t normally associate with a shopping run. Costco’s automotive department has outstanding deals on tires and other services that are performed on-site, and there are also optometry and prescription departments ready to provide important personal health services at lower prices. Travel deals, check printing, free roadside assistance, auto insurance, water delivery — it’s no exaggeration to say that Costco has virtually any and everything you can think of.</p>
<p>But the only way to get in on all of these goods and services at fantastic prices is by having a membership. StackSocial’s deals for new members on a year of Gold Star membership for $65 or a year of Executive Gold Star membership for $130 await, <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5025/">as do the $40 (Gold Star) or $65 (Executive Gold Star) gift cards that automatically recoup much your first year’s fee.</a></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><span>Last time that the Department of Homeland Security used a video game property to try and recruit people to </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/portland-frog-costume-ice-facility-protest-oregon-trump-2000634001"><span>ICE</span></a><span>, it was with </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/department-homeland-security-ice-pokemon-song-video-2000627900"><span>a </span><i><span>Pokémon</span></i><span> video</span></a><span> in which they said they were going to “catch” undocumented people while the original anime’s theme song played over footage of ICE agents invading homes and arresting people. </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-responds-to-dhs-video-using-the-original-animes-theme-2000628222"><span>The Pokémon Company didn’t do anything about it</span></a><span>, so I guess whoever’s on the DHS’ social accounts is feeling brave enough to keep using video game imagery to try and promote ICE and recruit people to its cause, because it’s now using </span><i><span>Halo </span></i><span>imagery and language days after Halo Studios </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/halo-remake-campaign-evolved-playstation-cross-play-2000638951"><span>announced the original game is being remade and ported to PlayStation</span></a><span>.</span></p> <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">Finishing this fight. <a href="https://t.co/6Ezq9NUqMq">pic.twitter.com/6Ezq9NUqMq</a></p> <p>— Homeland Security (@DHSgov) <a href="https://twitter.com/DHSgov/status/1982819431894901043?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 27, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <p><span>The post on the DHS’ X account has an image of </span><i><span>Halo</span></i><span> characters on a Warthog with the subtitle “Finishing this fight,” a reference to the line from </span><i><span>Halo 2</span></i><span> in which protagonist Master Chief says he’s “finishing this fight” with the Covenant by blowing up their ship at the end of the sequel. The image itself has the text “Destroy the Flood,” which refers to a parasitic alien species that Master Chief and his friends fight throughout the series, just above a link to the ICE recruitment website. The rhetoric is not subtle.</span></p>

 <p><span>The replies are full of the same memetic bullshit you often see on such posts that shows some people view uprooting other people’s lives (or worse) as something to cheer for and encourage the way you might celebrate a sports team’s championship win. The broader context of the Trump Administration using Xbox and Microsoft’s imagery for a stupid recruitment ad, however, shows the rot runs much deeper. Notably, Microsoft has donated to Trump and his causes during his presidency, including the </span><a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/white-house/list-donors-trump-new-white-house-ballroom-east-wing-rcna239481"><span>ongoing demolition of the White House’s East Wing</span></a><span> and his </span><a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2025/01/09/microsoft-contributes-1-million-to-trumps-inauguration-fund.html"><span>inauguration fund</span></a><span>, likely to garner his support on issues like artificial intelligence. That’s not entirely surprising given the company’s political history, as Microsoft has reportedly made efforts to </span><a href="https://www.gamefile.news/p/microsofts-xbox-team-snaps-a-four"><span>erase its own diversity initiatives</span></a><span> and </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/bethesda-zenimax-roe-v-wade-abortion-politics-microsoft-1849134727"><span>inadequately responded to right-wing attacks on reproductive rights</span></a><span> in the eyes of some of its workers.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>The </span><i><span>Halo </span></i><span>post from DHS came just hours after GameStop and the Trump Administration went back and forth with console war memes </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/donald-trump-halo-gamestop-console-wars-meme-ai-images-2000639237"><span>that also used </span><i><span>Halo</span></i><span> characters</span></a><span>. We’ve reached out to Microsoft and Halo Studios for comment and will update this story if we hear back.</span></p>

              <p>Amazon is making it easier than ever to upgrade your laptop without blowing your budget. In fact, you don’t even need to spend more than $500 on a reliable device that’s ready to take on everyday tasks, multitasking, and even some light gaming.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5021/">Right now, the 15.6-inch HP laptop is down to $499, after a steep 71% off its original price of nearly $1,700.</a> You’re saving an unbelievable $1,200, and this model is only $100 more than the entry-level version with 16GB RAM and 256GB storage. It’s also the lowest we’ve seen it drop to in 30 days. Act fast to grab yours, as the discount might wrap up anytime now.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5021/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Responsive, Fast Performance for Work and Entertainment</h2>
<p>Looks-wise, it’s a classic HP laptop. You’re getting that sleek silver finish in a slim, portable frame. It’s lightweight enough to carry around all day without feeling like it’s dragging your shoulder down. Power-wise, though, it’s a whole different story.</p>
<p>The laptop is powered by an Intel N100 processor (quad-core, up to 3.4GHz) for responsive performance for all your tasks. It’s not built for heavy creative workloads, but it’ll handle most regular workdays without slowing you down. With the processor, you’ve got 32GB of RAM for efficient multitasking, plus a 1TB PCIe SSD that offers a huge space to store all that you own. It also runs on Windows 11 Pro, meaning you’ll get to work on one of the most user-friendly, efficient systems out there.</p>



<p>The 15.6-inch Full HD anti-glare display pushes detailed visuals that are easier on the eyes. Whether you’re working on presentations or watching a movie, picture quality stays vibrant and sharp. Battery life is just as impressive. Most of it will depend on how you use it, of course, but you can expect to get through a few hours without worrying about plugging it in.</p>
<p>You’re also getting a full set of modern connectivity options that include Wi-Fi 6E, Bluetooth 5.3, USB-C, two USB-A ports, HDMI, a headphone/mic combo jack, and a smart AC power pin. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5021/">Considering how you’d normally pay over $1,000 for a device with all these features, grabbing the laptop for under $500 feels like a steal</a>. It’s got impressive visuals, a reliable processor, sufficient space, and much more at a discount. Again, we don’t expect the offer to last long, which is why it’s best to grab it sooner rather than later.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Report: Next Xbox Could Be The First Console To Kill The Multiplayer Paywall]]></title>
            <link>https://kotaku.com/next-gen-xbox-paid-multiplayer-game-pass-2000639263</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/report-next-xbox-could-be-the-first-console-to-kill-the-multiplayer-paywall.1335901/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>For over two decades, Microsoft has been charging Xbox owners anywhere from $4 to $10 a month for access to online multiplayer. The full suite of features was bundled as Xbox Live Gold and has since morphed into being part of Game Pass. The company is now reportedly exploring doing away with that fee for <a href="https://kotaku.com/microsoft-next-gen-xbox-pc-windows-rog-ally-2000638181">its next-gen console</a>, bringing it more in-line with PC gaming where the perk is provided by companies for free.</p> <p>According to a new report <a href="https://www.windowscentral.com/gaming/xbox/microsofts-ambitious-new-xbox-your-entire-console-library-the-full-power-of-windows-pc-gaming-and-more">by<em> Windows Central</em></a>, the “current plan” is for the next Xbox to have no paywall for multiplayer. The outlet adds that “it remains to be seen if that plan actually plays out into reality,” but it sounds like there is at least serious consideration within Microsoft for abandoning the last remnants of its Xbox Live legacy with the arrival of the new system or systems which are currently <a href="https://kotaku.com/ps6-next-gen-xbox-price-specs-leak-release-date-2000635303">rumored to be releasing near the end of 2027</a>.</p>

 <p>It would be another seismic shift for the company’s gaming division which has long collected this multiplayer tax in exchange for the ability to play annual hits like <em>Call of Duty</em>, <em>Madden</em>, and <em>NBA2K </em>online. While it’s become standard to allow players on console to access free-to-play games without making them pay for platform memberships, forcing players to pay for online gameplay in premium titles like <em>Diablo 4</em>, <em>Mario Kart World</em>, and <em>Helldivers 2</em> has generated massive amounts of what feels like effectively passive income for the respective console makers.</p>

 <p>It’s unclear how many of Game Pass’ millions of subscribers are currently enrolled simply to play with friends online, but that benefit alone is responsible for a huge portion of the cost of the most expensive tier of the program. While Game Pass Ultimate for console users <a href="https://kotaku.com/xbox-game-pass-cancel-controversy-console-pc-2000631061">was recently raised to $3</a><a href="https://kotaku.com/xbox-game-pass-cancel-controversy-console-pc-2000631061">0</a>, the service is still just $16.50 on PC where <em>Sea of Thieves</em> and other live-service hits can all be played online for free. Ditching the multiplayer paywall on a more Windows PC-like next-gen Xbox would also require overhauling those pricing schemes.</p> <p>If the plan does go through, there will be two immediate questions: Why did Microsoft spend all of those previous years charging Xbox users for multiplayer? And how will Sony and Nintendo continue to justify charging for multiplayer on the upcoming PlayStation 6 and current Switch 2? Competition between platforms is good, and Microsoft providing valuable and meaningful alternatives in the future would be one way to help pressure both Sony and Nintendo into doing the same.</p>
