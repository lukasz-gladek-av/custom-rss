              <p><span>Normal </span><i><span>Pragmata</span></i><span> fans are excited about Capcom’s upcoming sci-fi action-adventure because </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/capcom-pragmata-mega-man-conspiracy-theory-debunked-2000621414"><span>it reminds them a bit of </span><i><span>Mega Man</span></i></a><span> or because they find its concept, setting, or gameplay intriguing</span><span>.</span><span> But some of the game’s fans are far from normal. Reactions to the infantile appearance of<em> Pragmata</em>‘s android protagonist Diana on the r/Pragmata subreddit have prompted one of its moderators to publicly step down from their role, with them citing the overwhelming influx of “pedo shit” as the cause. Another <em>Pragmata</em> community has been shut down altogether by Reddit over inappropriate posts.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>The </span><i><span>Pragmata </span></i><span>community on Reddit has splintered into three distinct subreddits: r/Pragmata, the main subreddit, r/PragmataSFW, a self-described “attempt at building up a sub that isn’t plastered with pedophile dogwhistles,” and r/Pragmata_, which was just banned on February 18 for breaking Reddit’s “Rule 4.” For context, Rule 4 </span><a href="https://redditinc.com/policies/reddit-rules"><span>explicitly forbids</span></a><span> the “sharing of sexual, abusive, or suggestive content involving minors.”</span></p> <p><span>In one </span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/PragmataSFW/comments/1qw54aq/i_was_a_mod_for_rpragmata_and_it_disgusts_me/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button"><span>February 4 post</span></a><span> on r/PragmataSFW, moderator JoeZocktGames stated that none of their “proposals to be more strict were taken seriously,” and derided the r/Pragmata subreddit for inviting “several mods with feeds full of lewd Loli shit.” The user also claimed that another moderator, who is still part of the moderation team on the subreddit, had a post manually removed by Reddit’s main staff because it featured obscene artwork of Diana. “You know it’s bad when mods post CP and Reddit needs to step in.”</span></p> <p><span>Prior to moderator JoeZocktGames stepping down, the moderation team behind the original subreddit attempted to address the “</span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Pragmata/comments/1qtgjj8/regarding_recent_toxicity/"><span>recent toxicity</span></a><span>” by banning “users who post sexualised content involving Diana” and removing “any sexualised comments, jokes, or content” involving the character. This is what led to the creation of r/Pragmata_, which solely focused on posting “lewd” artwork of Diana. The contents of the subreddit were </span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Gamingcirclejerk/comments/1r7x4ul/dawg_i_just_opened_reddit/"><span>immediately condemned</span></a><span> elsewhere on Reddit.</span></p> <p><span>This wave of r/Pragmata_ scrutiny may be what caused Reddit to take action, leading to the subreddit being banned earlier today. Since Rule 4 states only that “sexual, abusive, or suggestive” content featuring minors and “any predatory or inappropriate behavior involving a minor” is strictly prohibited, it suggests the subreddit’s focus on Diana is the main reason for its removal.</span></p> <p><span>This is, sadly, not the first time that the </span><i><span>Pragmata </span></i><span>community has drawn ire for its inappropriate focus on Diana, as the “Cute” and “Funny” tags, a well-known “pedophile dog whistle,” </span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Gamingcirclejerk/comments/1l4gobm/steam_users_are_tagging_pragmata_with_pedophile/"><span>were spotted</span></a><span> on its Steam store page back in June 2025.</span></p>

            <title><![CDATA[Gorgeous Pixel Art Cyberpunk Game Replaced Delayed At The Last Minute After Steam Demo Feedback]]></title>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>The long wait for <a href="https://kotaku.com/replaced-release-date-cyberpunk-pixel-art-batman-arkham-2000620061"><em>Replaced</em> was almost over</a>, until now. The beautiful pixel art action platformer’s March launch has been pushed back by the developers following feedback on a recent Steam demo. “The response to our Steam demo has been the ultimate fuel for us,” Sad Cat Studios wrote on Wednesday.</p> <p>“As a small team working on our very first title, we’ve poured everything we have into this project,” reads the <a href="https://x.com/REPLACEDGame/status/2024122392310591889">studio’s announcement</a>. “While the game is technically finished, reaching this final stretch has shown us that we need just a few more weeks to ensure the experience is exactly what you deserve. We want the version of <em>Replaced</em> you play on day one to be polished, stable, and true to the vision we’ve shared with you. Instead of March 12, the Game Pass release will now arrive on April 14.</p>

  <p><em>Replaced</em> began development back in 2018, was revealed at E3 2021, and promised for a 2022 launch. Lofty ambitions and things like the Russia-Ukrainian War torpedoed those plans. After waiting an extra four years, what’s one more month?</p> <p>The action-adventure’s Steam demo has gotten generally positive feedback. The 2.5D art, cinematics, and mood have all been praised. The combat, however, might leave something to be desired. According to some demo reactions at least,<em> Replaced</em>‘s mechanics might be a bit repetitive and undercooked compared to its visual aesthetic. If accurate, it wouldn’t be a huge surprise for a game like this.</p>

 <p>But sometimes style and vibes are enough. I hope that’s the case with <em>Replaced</em>.</p>
