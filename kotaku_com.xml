              <p>Looking for a new pair of headphones tha sound great but won’t cost an entire paycheck? You might not believe it, but you can get a pair of Beats Studio Pro headphones for a fantastic price. And they sound great, too.</p>
<p>The Beats Studio Pro are exactly what you’re looking for, and they’re more than affordable. Y<a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5994/">ou can get them at Amazon for $179.95, which is a $170.05 (49%) discount from their original price of $349.95</a>. If you ask us, that’s a significant price cut.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5994/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Headphones with booming bass and crisp treble in a slick package</h2>
<p>This model is perfect for anyone looking to be fully immersed in whatever they’re doing (listening to music, podcasts, etc.). Their ear cups are well-cushioned and extremely comfortable, so you can wear them for extended periods of time without them starting to hurt. The adjustable headband lets you customize the headphones’ fit, so you can tighten them or loosen them as you see fit.</p>
<p>The Beats Studio Pro excel when it comes to delivering quality audio, and that’s what you’re here for, right? These headphones are able to produce precise and detailed sound no matter what type of music you like to listen to. The bass is deep and full but doesn’t overpower the midrange and treble. Plus, the vocal clarity is crisp and clear.</p>



<p>Another feature of the Beats Studio Pro is the active noise cancellation that helps eliminate ambient noise so you can focus on your audio without distractions. No matter where you may be (on a crowded train, in a busy office, etc.) the ANC feature can make a serious difference. In addition to blocking out distractions, the Studio Pro headphones also have a feature called “Transparency Mode” that lets you allow outside noises in so you can hear what’s going on even when wearing the headphones.</p>
<p>In terms of battery life, the Beats Studio Pro can give you several hours of playback time on a single charge. In addition to the battery life, the carrying case of the headphones is capable of getting you back up to speed quickly so you are ready to go again. Fast charging is supported by the headphones so you can obtain a meaningful boost to the battery in a short period of time.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5994/">All in all, the Beats Studio Pro are a combination of powerful sound, comfort and intelligent features in a product that not only looks great but also performs exceptionally well.</a> And you’re not going to find a better deal for some time, being that we’ve reached the end of the holiday gifting season. That means you should snap yours up while you still can.</p>

              <p>I feel like a broken record, but once again, in many ways this was a bad year for developers, gamers, and the industry writ large. But hey, just because AI slop is ruining everything and greedy execs are destroying pop culture, that doesn’t mean we can’t find some joy and genuinely great moments in all the bullshit.</p> <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/best-surprises-games-trailers-video-game-moments-2024-1851725768">Like we’ve</a> <a href="https://kotaku.com/baldur-s-gate-3-alan-wake-musical-unions-peaches-blade-1851116121">done in years past</a>, <a href="https://kotaku.com/best-video-game-news-announcements-surprises-2022-1849899925">here</a> we’ve collected 10 of the best video game surprises and bits of good news from the past year. Hold on to them tightly. Cherish them. Reread this list a few times. Remember that things can be good. Hope is important. We’ll likely need a lot of it to get through 2026.</p>

 <hr> <h2><strong><em>Elden Ring Nightreign</em> Rules</strong></h2> <figure id="attachment_2000001641" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000001641"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000001641">©FromSoftware / Bandai Namco</figcaption></figure> <p><span>The average person seems pretty burnt out on live-service multiplayer games. Fans had every reason to respond with groans and sighs to the idea of the premier action-RPG maker turning its attention and resources to exactly that<!--StartFragment --><span>—<a href="https://kotaku.com/elden-ring-nightreign-multiplayer-release-date-trailer-1851720335">an online multiplayer game</a><!--StartFragment -->—</span>instead of toward its next single-player adventure.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><span>But FromSoftware delivered with</span> <a href="https://kotaku.com/elden-ring-nightreign-wandering-mausoleum-meteor-1851784652"><i><span>Elden Ring Nightreign</span></i></a><span>. It didn’t just successfully nail multiplayer <em>Elden Ring;</em> it produced an entire new mash-up of genres that I wish more games would try to experiment with. Do you need close friends to get maximum enjoyment? Sure. But unlike some of the friendslop turning heads out there this year, <em>Nightreign</em>‘s magic goes far beyond capturing hot mics and silly moments. (It’s great for that too, though.) I now expect great things from<em> The Duskbloods</em> and would love to see FromSoftware reimagine </span><i><span>Armored Core</span></i><span> PVE for the modern era. -Ethan Gach</span></p>

 <h2><strong><em>Star Wars: Fate of The Old Republic</em> Announced</strong></h2> <figure id="attachment_2000653099" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000653099"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000653099">©Lucasfilm</figcaption></figure> <p>The 2025 Game Awards started off with a super-surprising announcement: <a href="https://kotaku.com/everything-we-know-about-star-wars-fate-of-the-old-republic-release-date-trailer-2000653076"><em>Star Wars: Fate of the Old Republic</em></a>. This is a new single-player RPG from <em>Knights of the Old Republic </em>and <em>Mass Effect</em> director Casey Hudson, and is a spiritual successor to <em>KOTOR</em>. Holy shit, folks! Sure, it ain’t <em>KOTOR 3,</em> but it’s likely the closest we’ll ever get to that game, and that alone has fans excited.</p>

 <p>Before you start getting <em>too</em> hyped to play <em>Fate of the Old Republic,</em> it should be noted that the studio working on <em>FOTOR</em> was formed just a few months ago, so this game is likely five or more years away from release and could launch on PlayStation 6 or even PS7.&nbsp; <a href="https://kotaku.com/star-wars-fate-of-the-old-republic-fotor-2030-casey-hudson-rpg-rumor-2000653419">Hudson denies this, however,</a> and claims it will be out before 2030. I want to believe him, but I’m not sold on that being possible unless <em>Fate of the Old Republic</em> is much smaller in scope than most AAA RPGs. We’ll just have to wait and see, and hope this one doesn’t get canceled.</p>

 <h2><strong><em>Digital Foundry</em> And <em>Giant Bomb</em> Going Fully Independent&nbsp;</strong></h2> <figure id="attachment_2000002971" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000002971"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000002971">©Giant Bomb</figcaption></figure> <p><span>The digital games media space has never been more pervasive, thanks to creator platforms like TikTok and YouTube, but it’s also never been less able to support large institutional teams producing work that wouldn’t otherwise flourish on our algorithmically driven internet. </span><span>So it was heartening to see that despite the broader digital media apocalypse, there’s still room for once corporate-owned outlets to thrive in the indie space. <a href="https://kotaku.com/giant-bomb-fandom-dan-ryckert-jeff-grubb-gerstmann-1851778728">That includes the re-launch of <em>Giant Bomb</em></a> and <a href="https://kotaku.com/digital-foundry-df-direct-ign-patreon-retro-games-media-2000616308"><em>Digital Foundry</em></a>, as well as things like <em>Game Informer</em> coming back to life with a physical magazine that you can actually buy IRL.&nbsp; – Ethan Gach</span></p>

 <h2><strong>Nintendo Adds Virtual Boy Emulation To The Switch Online Catalog</strong></h2> <figure id="attachment_2000227927" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000227927"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000227927">©Nintendo</figcaption></figure> <p>There aren’t many people around who fondly remember Nintendo’s failed stereoscopic 3D Virtual Boy console from 1995. It was a big flop for the company, was barely supported by it or third-party studios, and has mostly faded into the past as an odd misfire from the Mario maker.</p> <p>But it is still a part of video game history, and so it was <a href="https://kotaku.com/virtual-boy-nintendo-switch-classics-2000625301">extremely unexpected but nice to see</a> Nintendo announce Virtual Boy games coming to Nintendo Switch Online. And to let you play these rudimentary 3D games properly, Nintendo is shipping a whole new headset accessory that looks a lot like the OG Virtual Boy. All of this arrives in February 2026.</p> <h2><strong><em>Terminator 2D: No Fate</em> Was Worth The Wait</strong></h2> <figure id="attachment_2000653434" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000653434"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000653434">©Reef Entertainment</figcaption></figure> <p>Back in February,&nbsp;<i data-stringify-type="italic">Terminator 2D: No Fate&nbsp;</i>was announced with&nbsp;<u data-stringify-type="underline"><a href="https://youtu.be/hfj6FBLZxsg?si=Vzwt9zCUnmlRgpKj" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-stringify-link="https://youtu.be/hfj6FBLZxsg?si=Vzwt9zCUnmlRgpKj" data-sk="tooltip_parent">a reveal trailer</a></u>&nbsp;that immediately propelled the game to the top of my most wanted list. With its beautiful pixel art and excellent animation,&nbsp;<i data-stringify-type="italic">No Fate</i>&nbsp;looked like it might finally deliver the pulse-pounding run-and-gun action game that James Cameron’s seminal sci-fi flick has always deserved, but never received. Amping up my excitement in the months that followed were videos&nbsp;<u data-stringify-type="underline"><a href="https://youtu.be/Zir-oFQT4Io?si=BlpNliC8T3_TfMhi" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-stringify-link="https://youtu.be/Zir-oFQT4Io?si=BlpNliC8T3_TfMhi" data-sk="tooltip_parent">like this one</a></u>, which highlighted that the folks at developer Bitmap Bureau had the knowledge, skills, and experience to deliver a game that paid homage to the arcade action classics of yesteryear while also feeling exciting and rewarding today. But you never know for sure until a game arrives, so as hopeful as I was, I also feared that the end result might be a disappointing one.</p>

 <p>Originally set for release in September,&nbsp;<i data-stringify-type="italic">No Fate&nbsp;</i>saw delay after delay, pushing it back to December 12 and making me more anxious than ever. <a href="https://kotaku.com/terminator-2d-no-fate-review-steam-switch-ps5-2000653418">But the end result proved to be everything I hoped it could be</a>: a gorgeous, varied, challenging, and immensely rewarding action game that not only does the film justice, but earns a place among the best arcade-style action games of all time. What a wonderful surprise to help close out the year! – Carolyn Petit</p> <h2><strong><em>Helldivers 2</em> Comes To Xbox,<em> Gears Of War</em> Goes To PlayStation</strong></h2> <figure id="attachment_2000000318" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000000318"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000000318">©PlayStation Studios</figcaption></figure> <p>The era of video game exclusives has truly come to an end. I mean, we all sort of knew that already, but in 2025, we watched it happen in real-time in a way that I’ve never seen before. On August 26,<a href="https://kotaku.com/a-review-of-gears-of-war-reloaded-and-the-state-of-the-franchise-2000620106"> <em>Gears of War: Reloaded</em></a>, a remaster of a remake of the first game in the once Xbox-only series, arrived on PlayStation 5. On the very same day, the <a href="https://kotaku.com/helldivers-2-xbox-series-x-s-release-date-ps5-exclusive-1851785573">PlayStation published <em>Helldivers 2</em> launched on Xbox Series X/S consoles</a>. It was like watching a prisoner exchange on a bridge between two nations that were once at war, but who now have struck a truce.</p>

 <p>And yeah,<a href="https://kotaku.com/gears-of-war-remastered-reloaded-running-ps5-xbox-weird-2000620092"> playing <em>Gears of War</em> on a PlayStation is strange</a>! I earned Xbox achievements on a PS5. We live in weird times. But I’m also happy that the future seems to be one in which you won’t need to own every console to play every game. That’s nice, and as consoles get more expensive, it will be a boon for gamers trying to enjoy the hobby on a limited budget.</p> <h2><strong>Id Software, Bethesda, and Ubisoft Studios In North America Unionize!&nbsp;</strong></h2> <figure id="attachment_2000001754" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000001754"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000001754">©Bethesda / id Software</figcaption></figure> <p><span>Despite the bottom falling out of the AAA video game industry this year, gaming’s nascent labor movement has continued to eke out notable victories. <a href="https://kotaku.com/diablo-4-blizzard-union-ai-layoffs-microsoft-2000621003">Multiple teams at Blizzard</a> <a href="https://kotaku.com/overwatch-2-blizzard-team-4-union-microsoft-1851779922">announced new wall-to-wall unions</a>, <a href="https://kotaku.com/doom-id-software-union-microsoft-xbox-cwa-2000653008">while developers at Bethesda</a> <a href="https://kotaku.com/bethesda-devs-win-first-ever-union-contact-at-a-major-g-1851783142">secured their first contract.</a> And the organizing isn’t just isolated to Microsoft-owned studios in the U.S.,<a href="https://kotaku.com/star-wars-lawsuit-kotor-2-switch-divinity-2000655351"> Ubisoft Halifax in Canada just formed a union as well</a>. – Ethan Gach</span></p> <h2><strong><em>Fortnite’s</em> Mini-<em>Simpson</em>s Season Was Great, Actually!&nbsp;</strong></h2> <figure id="attachment_2000640880" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000640880"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000640880">©Epic</figcaption></figure> <p>A mini <em>Fortnite</em> season based entirely on<a href="https://kotaku.com/fortnite-simpsons-house-layout-mystery-rumpus-room-secret-new-areas-2000641142"><em> The Simpsons</em></a> could have been a disaster. But despite the odds, Epic was able to make it work and delivered what might be <a href="https://kotaku.com/fortnite-simpsons-mini-season-review-changes-new-map-short-2000640868">my favorite season of <em>Fortnite</em> in a long time</a>. The Springfield island map was incredible to explore. The visuals felt very cartoonish and <em>Simpsons</em>-y without looking too garish, and all the <em>Simpsons</em> Easter eggs and characters that appeared throughout the event were a treat for fans. And on top of all that, this season included funny animated segments featuring <em>Simpsons</em> characters that were written by the staff of the show. Is this just one more sign of all of pop culture merging together into a grey slurry? Sure. But whatever, man, I can now play as Moe in <em>Fortnite</em>. I’m happy.</p>

 <h2><strong><em>Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion Remastered </em>Shadow-dropped</strong></h2> <figure id="attachment_2000626874" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000626874"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000626874">©Bethesda</figcaption></figure> <p>Years of marketing, teasers, and trailers are annoying and tiring. I mean, we’ve been waiting years for more information about <em>The </em><em>Elder Scrolls 6,</em> a game that was announced all the way back in 2018 when E3 was still a thing. <a href="https://kotaku.com/bethesdas-oblivion-remaster-is-out-now-on-xbox-ps5-an-1851777265">So getting a remake of 2006’s <em>The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion</em> out of nowhere was super nice.</a> No long waits. No delays. No annoying series of teasers and trailers. Just a reveal and boom, you were playing the game.</p> <p>Based on how well it did, people seem to agree that shadow-dropping a game like <em>Oblivion</em> is a good idea. <a href="https://kotaku.com/elder-scrolls-6-tes6-shadow-drop-todd-howard-release-date-fallout-3-2000642434">Even Todd Howard seems into the idea</a> of launching games like this. And hey, <em>Oblivion Remastered</em> ended up being a solid and very pretty way to play (or replay) Bethesda’s seminal open-world RPG. Now, let’s hope next year’s list of best surprises features an entry about a <em>Fallout 3 </em>remaster shadow-dropping out of nowhere.</p> <h2><strong><em>Hollow Knight: Silksong</em> Finally Launches After A Long Wait</strong></h2> <figure id="attachment_2000619153" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000619153"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000619153">Team Cherry</figcaption></figure> <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/hollow-knight-silksong-review-hornet-team-cherry-2000639568"><i><span>Hollow Knight: Silksong</span></i></a><span> could have easily been delayed out of 2025 or been disappointingly mid when it launched. Instead, it built on the foundation of the original without losing sight of what made that one so special. May every long-awaited sequel <em>*cough* </em></span><em><span>GTA 6</span></em><span><em> *cough*</em> manage to deliver the same.&nbsp; – Ethan Gach</span></p>

Even better, the memory can be expanded up to 64GB as needed. Storage capacity is just as exceptional. You’re getting a built-in 1TB PCIe 4.0 NVMe SSD, which offers enough space to house all your important documents, research stuff, media content, etc, in a single place.

Triple display output is also supported for those looking to create a bigger, more productive work setup. But despite this, the PC stays calm and cool while working.

              <p><span>The Pokémon Company seems likely t</span><span>o reveal the upcoming Generation X games in February on the series’ 30th anniversary, but if leakers have anything to say about it, Game Freak might not have much new information to give us by the time that showcase arrives. On December 24, a series of new leaks about the games, allegedly titled </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-leak-generation-10-wind-wave-galar-legends-mmo-2000635337"><i><span>Pokémon Wind </span></i><span>and </span><i><span>Wave</span></i></a><span>, began spreading online. We’ve gotten a few waves (sorry) of information since </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-wind-wave-pikachu-leak-generation-10-redesign-2000635674"><span>the massive Teraleak</span></a><span> in October, but now we know a little bit more about the games’ map, battle gimmick, and have even our first look at the new region’s professor.</span></p> <p><span>The latest info was posted on X early today by self-described <a href="https://x.com/i/status/2003786462651932797">Pokémon detective Moot Monthly</a>. All of these new images, animations, and illustrations are reportedly from this existing leak, so it’s entirely possible they aren’t indicative of the final games that will eventually ship on Switch 2. But they do give us some interesting insight into what Game Freak has been working on for the next mainline entries.&nbsp;</span></p>

Apparently, the professor will ride around in a car and appear in multiple locations in the games’ archipelago setting. Right now, all we know is that he appears to be an older man with thick eyebrows and a beard.</span></p>

 <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="de" dir="ltr">Pokémon Gen 10 leak: the new Professor (he drives around in a car!) and how the new Pokémon Centers will look <a href="https://t.co/erGuj76bUM">https://t.co/erGuj76bUM</a></p> <p>— Centro LEAKS (@CentroLeaks) <a href="https://twitter.com/CentroLeaks/status/2003838143943094555?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 24, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <p><span>Speaking of the archipelago, we also have a new illustration of the Gen X region. Its beta map shows several islands that the player will be able to explore. Early reports say they will be procedurally generated, so it’s unclear if the map is a sort of presumed “default” shape for these islands or if the terrain is what changes for each player, rather than the shape of the landmass.&nbsp;</span></p>

What we can see for now is that this phenomenon will seemingly distort a Pokémon’s physical shape and then create some kind of cloud to obscure them. Looking at what this shit does to Pikachu in the leaked animation, I’m not immediately onboard. But hey, it’s leaked in-development footage from a hack. We’ll see how it actually changes up battles when the games are eventually revealed.</span></p>

For now, </span><i><span>Pokémon Legends: Z-A</span></i><span>’s </span><i><span>Mega Dimension </span></i><span>DLC is keeping me busy, so I’m not starving for something new right now.</span></p>
