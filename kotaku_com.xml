It takes inspiration from Blizzard’s game in plenty of ways, from general game modes to its style of monetization. Another way it takes inspiration is in its characters.</p><p>Some hero abilities in <em>Marvel Rivals</em> are clearly taken right from <em>Overwatch </em>characters. Many characters are pretty conceptually similar as well. For instance, Hulk comes to mind as a very similar concept to D. Va, both heroes have a “transformation” to make them immensely more powerful. That can be useful to keep in mind if you’re coming into <em>Rivals</em> fresh from <em>Overwatch</em> and want to roll with characters that feel familiar. </p><p><br>Luckily for you, we’ve put together a collection of five  characters so similar to <em>Overwatch </em>characters that many will find themselves right at home when jumping in. <br></p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="37c379b421ddaefada7bc64cdc0fbf8a" data-recommend-id="image://37c379b421ddaefada7bc64cdc0fbf8a" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="720" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Widowmaker and Black Widow are juxtaposed together." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Widowmaker and Black Widow are juxtaposed together." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Blizzard / Marvel Games / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="37c379b421ddaefada7bc64cdc0fbf8a" data-recommend-id="image://37c379b421ddaefada7bc64cdc0fbf8a" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="720" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Widowmaker and Black Widow are juxtaposed together." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Yes, if you can believe it, the two characters with “Widow” in their name play incredibly similar. Black Widow’s sniper will be incredibly familiar to Widowmaker veterans, and she has a movement ability to help get her into the perfect sniper position. Their close-quarters combat varies a bit, and they have different Ultimates, but Black Widow is an easy main for former Widowmaker players.</p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="4fb0fbcd7b18aa84f34a15c5883ce65a" data-recommend-id="image://4fb0fbcd7b18aa84f34a15c5883ce65a" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="720" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Hanzo and Hawkeye are juxtaposed together." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Hanzo and Hawkeye are juxtaposed together." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Blizzard / Marvel Games / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="4fb0fbcd7b18aa84f34a15c5883ce65a" data-recommend-id="image://4fb0fbcd7b18aa84f34a15c5883ce65a" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="720" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Hanzo and Hawkeye are juxtaposed together." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Another obvious Avengers parallel, Hawkeye and Hanzo are natural counterparts. Their abilities differ a bit, though. Hawkeye’s slashing abilities are unique to his kit, and his Ultimate is something completely new. However, the similarity in their main bow and arrow shots is undeniable. Hanzo mains should absolutely be running to try Hawkeye as their first character in <em>Marvel Rivals</em>.</p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="680a98443b5a6fb2c8c7c9b7418144e6" data-recommend-id="image://680a98443b5a6fb2c8c7c9b7418144e6" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="720" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Junkrat and Squirrel Girl are juxtaposed together." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Junkrat and Squirrel Girl are juxtaposed together." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Blizzard / Marvel Games / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="680a98443b5a6fb2c8c7c9b7418144e6" data-recommend-id="image://680a98443b5a6fb2c8c7c9b7418144e6" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="720" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Junkrat and Squirrel Girl are juxtaposed together." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Squirrel Girl is already proving to be a force to be reckoned with in <em>Marvel Rivals</em>, just like her very similar counterpart, Junkrat. Squirrel Girl’s primary fire grenade launcher is similar to Junkrat’s. And the similarities go far beyond the main weapon. She has a traversal ability to bounce on her tail to give her extra height, not too dissimilar from Junkrat. In addition, her secondary fire helps stun people. While it’s more active than Junkrat’s Steel Trap, these two abilities work in much the same way. Overall, Junkrat fans may find a lot of muscle memory transfers over to Squirrel Girl.</p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="1016d60f24097e92d2cec965a43f1aa3" data-recommend-id="image://1016d60f24097e92d2cec965a43f1aa3" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="720" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Winston and Venom are juxtaposed together." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Winston and Venom are juxtaposed together." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Blizzard / Marvel Games / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="1016d60f24097e92d2cec965a43f1aa3" data-recommend-id="image://1016d60f24097e92d2cec965a43f1aa3" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="720" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Winston and Venom are juxtaposed together." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Winston is a tank that <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/the-problem-with-overwatchs-dive-meta-1796828151&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/the-problem-with-overwatchs-dive-meta-1796828151">dominated <em>Overwatch</em>’s infamous dive meta</a></span>, and Venom has a lot of similar shades. Both are tanks that rely on leaping headfirst into trouble. Once they’re in the enemy backlines, their primary attacks are both short range “beams” that don’t do heavy damage but can really add up over time. Venom’s other abilities are more focused on self-sustaining than providing specific cover for teammates, but if you played Winston in <em>Overwatch</em>, a switch from the simian to the symbiote may be in order for you.</p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="f60c3bf9239ab582c8ad72ed762fd3fe" data-recommend-id="image://f60c3bf9239ab582c8ad72ed762fd3fe" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="720" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Baptiste and Rocket Raccoon are juxtaposed next to each other." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Baptiste and Rocket Raccoon are juxtaposed next to each other." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Blizzard / Marvel Games / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="f60c3bf9239ab582c8ad72ed762fd3fe" data-recommend-id="image://f60c3bf9239ab582c8ad72ed762fd3fe" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="720" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Baptiste and Rocket Raccoon are juxtaposed next to each other." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Rocket Raccoon plays like a much simpler version of <em>Overwatch</em>’s high-flying support, Baptiste. Like Baptiste, Rocket fires healing grenades with a secondary fire, and uses a traditional ballistic weapon as their primary. They also have a powerful ability that requires a lot of trigger discipline: Immortality Beacon for Baptiste, and the B.R.B. for Rocket. Finally, both have a damage-boosting Ultimate ability. While Baptiste’s is a screen, Rocket’s shoots damage boosting beams surrounding his device.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Outside some brief mentions in-game, the most information I can find on it was just a bunch of players in the official Discord asking questions and occasionally getting an evaluated guess of an answer from a fellow player. But after some rigorous testing and cross-references with other materials, I’ve put together a handy breakdown of everything you need to know about Season Bonuses.</p><h2 id="h3899"><a id="whatis"></a>What is a Season Bonus?</h2><p><strong>Season Bonuses are class-specific buffs provided to a set of characters: </strong></p><ul data-type="List" data-style="Bullet"><li><strong>Vanguards get extra health </strong></li><li><strong>Duelists get a damage boost </strong></li><li><strong>Strategists get a healing bonus</strong>&nbsp;</li></ul><p>Each of the characters receiving these bonuses is involved in Team-Up Abilities. More specifically, each one serves as an anchor or initiator for them.</p><p>We’re assuming that this isn’t just a massive coincidence and the characters mentioned above were chosen for their Team-Ups role. The yellow symbol for Season Bonus is also used to infer to Team-Up Anchors after all. Adjusting these bonuses could be a way to motivate players to use these characters, or perhaps be a method of balancing on the developer’s part. Something that ties into both of those is the presumption that Season Bonuses will only last throughout the season. </p><p>The next season could adjust the values of these bonuses or provide them to entirely different characters. If these are indeed meant to be tied to Team-Ups, we could also see the debut of new ones and potentially the shelving of others. Again, we can only make guesses about Season Bonuses since we don’t have a proper explanation. Fingers crossed we have a detailed breakdown come time for Season One.</p><h2 id="h3900"><a id="activate"></a>How to activate a Season Bonus</h2><figure id="" data-id="522818f18a5795f8d58c6ce1dcd161aa" data-recommend-id="image://522818f18a5795f8d58c6ce1dcd161aa" data-format="jpg" data-width="3840" data-height="2160" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The Hero Profile page for Groot, shows his Team-Up Anchor Season Bonus in the bottom left." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="The Hero Profile page for Groot, shows his Team-Up Anchor Season Bonus in the bottom left." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Marvel Games / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="522818f18a5795f8d58c6ce1dcd161aa" data-recommend-id="image://522818f18a5795f8d58c6ce1dcd161aa" data-format="jpg" data-width="3840" data-height="2160" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The Hero Profile page for Groot, shows his Team-Up Anchor Season Bonus in the bottom left." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>There is a good chance that the first time you saw mention of a Season Bonus was while you were picking a hero to play.

They also say that the dock is rated for 60W and the Switch 2 itself is rated for 45W, both much higher than the model that launched back in 2017. And finally, the dock has two USB-A ports and one for USB-C, presumably the one that powers it, which is the same as the current model. </p><p>“I spoke with [NextHandheld], and I’ve now heard and seen enough to think they might be legit,” wrote<em> The Verge</em>’s Seaon Hollister. </p><p>Whether it ends up being 100 percent accurate or not, everything shared by the latest alleged Reddit leaker continues to line up with the rest of what we’ve been hearing, as well as with alleged <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/switch-2-specs-leaks-nintendo-screen-release-date-price-1851651185&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/switch-2-specs-leaks-nintendo-screen-release-date-price-1851651185">CAD mockups of what the Switch 2 looks like</a></span> <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/alleged-images-of-nintendos-new-switch-have-appeared-online/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/alleged-images-of-nintendos-new-switch-have-appeared-online/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">which circulated back in the fall</a></span>. Basically, the Switch 2 will look a lot like the current Switch, just slightly bigger, with a more rounded profile and a number of spec upgrades and design tweaks to improve handling and quality of life. </p><p>That’s not surprising in the context of the rest of the gaming hardware market. The Xbox Series X/S were not a major departure from the Xbox One. The PlayStation 5 is basically just a much more powerful PS4 with two ugly white fins. No one expects the Steam Deck 2 to look dramatically different than the existing one, and most PC gaming handhelds at this point all basically look the same: like a thick tablet with controllers on the sides. </p><p>But it is surprising given Nintendo’s own history of constantly trying to innovate in spaces where no one else is working. The company clung to cartridges longer than anyone and now uses SD cards. The Wii chased motion controls instead of HD graphics. The Wii U prioritized a second screen instead of beefier specs. And the Switch used smartphone specs to take gaming on the go. The notion of the company just iterating on the existing Switch, already the second most popular gaming console ever and fast closing in on the number one PS2, both made a ton of sense and seemed like it might still be too un-Nintendo to be real. </p><p>As we approach an eventual reveal of the Switch 2, every new potential leak points to Nintendo surprising fans by <em>not</em> doing the unexpected and instead doubling down on what already works. The only official thing we know about the upcoming hardware—that it will be backwards compatible with existing Switch games—only reinforces that seeming inevitability. </p><p>I’m sure the company might still have a few tricks and surprises up its sleeve. We’ll find out for sure whenever Nintendo actually announces the dang thing. It’s promised to do so before April 2025. </p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

As consoles have become more powerful, the <em>Madden </em>series has become more advanced and photorealistic. Online support also means EA and <em>Madden’s </em>devs can update player stats as the season goes on. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/madden-super-bowl-prediction-2024-1851231059&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/madden-super-bowl-prediction-2024-1851231059">All of this is to say that <em>Madden </em>is a very good simulation of the NFL and its players</a></span>. It’s so good that Johnson has reportedly used the game’s data when making decisions. </p><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/athletic/6005485/2024/12/19/jets-jerry-jeudy-trade-madden-woody-johnson/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.nytimes.com/athletic/6005485/2024/12/19/jets-jerry-jeudy-trade-madden-woody-johnson/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">On December 19, <em>The Athletic</em> reported</a></span> that during the last NFL offseason, a trade deal between the Jets and the Denver Broncos was close to being finished until owner Johnson vetoed the plan. According to multiple sources, the owner canceled the deal to pick up wide receiver Jerry Jeudy because the player had a low rating in <em>Madden</em>. Jeudy would be picked up by the Cleveland Browns and had a fantastic season. </p><p>The outlet reports that this isn’t the only time Johnson has relied on <em>Madden</em> when making decisions. The Jets owner pushed back on the team signing free-agent John Simpson due to his low “Awareness” rating in EA’s sports sim. The Jets signed him anyway and he had a good season. </p><p>According to some sources who spoke to the outlet, the use of <em>Madden </em>in decision-making is a sign that Johnson’s teenage sons have too much influence. </p><p>“When we’re discussing things, you’ll hear Woody cite something that Brick or Jack read online that’s being weighed equally against whatever opinion someone else in the department has,” a Jets executive told <em>The Athletic. </em></p><p>“It’s really sad that an adult would use a misleading anecdote about teenagers to make their father look bad. It’s ridiculous, quite honestly, the idea that this was used to influence the opinion of experienced executives,” said a Jets spokesperson. </p><p>“[The sons] have no roles in the organization. It’s completely ridiculous to suggest that any outside info is intended to replace the opinions of [Woody Johnson’s] staff.” </p><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/athletic/6005172/2024/12/19/woody-johnson-jets-madden-sons/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.nytimes.com/athletic/6005172/2024/12/19/woody-johnson-jets-madden-sons/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">This is just one of many other problems reported by the outlet in a longer report about the Jets’ dysfunctional and messy behind-the-scenes culture.</a></span> </p><p> .<br></p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
