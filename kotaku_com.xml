However, one player started trash-talking too much and Ortega made a bet him with that he would make the trip from one side of the United States to the other to put him in a chokehold. And he did just that and recorded it for social media.</p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="196395" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="The Week In Games: Co-Op Bug Blasting And More New Releases" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="80" data-playlist="196395,194440,195697" data-current="196395"><div><p>The Week In Games: Co-Op Bug Blasting And More New Releases</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196395/196395_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196395/196395_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196395/196395_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196395/196395_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/21945.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://bloodyelbow.com/2025/01/28/ufc-star-brian-ortega-chokes-fortnite-trash-talker-to-sleep-after-cross-country-trip-to-settle-online-bet/?callback=in&amp;code=MWU3MZK1ZMYTOWFJNY0ZYZE3LTKYNZQTNJJHN2IXYTVMNTFK&amp;state=f6bb0bbe1a644f0881f50b8edde634c3&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://bloodyelbow.com/2025/01/28/ufc-star-brian-ortega-chokes-fortnite-trash-talker-to-sleep-after-cross-country-trip-to-settle-online-bet/?callback=in&amp;code=MWU3MZK1ZMYTOWFJNY0ZYZE3LTKYNZQTNJJHN2IXYTVMNTFK&amp;state=f6bb0bbe1a644f0881f50b8edde634c3" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">As reported by <em>Bloody Elbow</em></a></span>, Ortega, who is famous for his MMA holds, recently <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.instagram.com/reel/DFYhbnnykfL/?utm_source=ig_embed&amp;ig_rid=a93efc09-5cc5-4add-aeef-94660d779900&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.instagram.com/reel/DFYhbnnykfL/?utm_source=ig_embed&amp;ig_rid=a93efc09-5cc5-4add-aeef-94660d779900" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">posted an Instagram video</a></span> in which he explained that a fellow <em>Fortnite </em>player talked too much smack, leading to the fighter flying from Los Angeles, California to North Carolina to settle a bet involving a sleeper hold. </p><p>“People ask me, ‘Play with me on <em>Fortnite,</em>’ cool cool,” said Ortega. “The only problem is you guys keep talking mad ‘<em>you know what.’ </em>So I have an online homie talking mad smack, the real reason why I flew to North Carolina was because he was talking shit. We made a bet, and I said I’ll fly over there and choke you out. And here he is! I showed up! I showed up to his damn job and I had to wait for him to finish his job. So now, Im’ma choke your ass out. A bet’s a bet!”</p><p>Above you can watch the video of him choking out the young man who he met in <em>Fortnite</em>. To be clear, the person in the video seems to be consenting to the chokehold and laughs about it after he passes out, but the clip is still a bit disturbing to watch as you see his arms go limp and his body and head twitch. </p><p>“Still want to play with me ?? Lol bets be crazy,” <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://x.com/BrianTcity/status/1884421221430817024&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://x.com/BrianTcity/status/1884421221430817024" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">posted Ortega on Twitter after the video went viral</a></span>. </p><p>Thankfully, this situation didn’t lead to someone being seriously injured, something that has happened before. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/archeage-mmorpg-hammer-attack-florida-new-jersey-police-1851567126&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/archeage-mmorpg-hammer-attack-florida-new-jersey-police-1851567126">In 2024 a gamer flew to Florida with a hammer</a></span> to attack a rival player he encountered in an MMORPG. </p><p> In the future I’d recommend people don’t make bets against UFC fighters involving chokeholds while playing <em>Fortnite</em>. Or any game for that matter. </p><p> .<br></p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
