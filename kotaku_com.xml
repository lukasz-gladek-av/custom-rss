In a moment of panic, you attempt to reload and clear the jam, but your weapon is so degraded it’s unusable. What now? In <em>S.T.A.L.K.E.R. 2</em>, these situations occur rapidly and frequently, making the series’ signature dangerous environment more harsh than ever.

You’ll note the broken weapon icon, typically in yellow or red, in the corner of the weapon preview window. This icon indicates your weapon is in poor condition, and if you continue using it, it will break and become unusable.</p><p>However, you can repair just about any weapon in the game by visiting a local Technician. They’re found inside safe zones, the first being Lens at Zalissya. Be wary, though. Repairing a weapon is expensive, so you likely won’t be able to fix every gun you scoop up from bandits.</p><h2 id="h176488"><a id="attachment"></a>Weapon Attachments Make Existing Weapons Better</h2><p>At the start, you’ll rock a lot of stock equipment without attachments. Why? Because you can’t afford any early on. Attachments cost a lot of coupons, especially the high-end scopes and suppressors, which you’ll find most valuable in the Zone.</p><p>Sure, you can find the occasional weapon attachment out in the world or receive one as a reward for completing a side quest, but you’ll be running low-end rifles and shotguns to start.</p><p>Once you unlock weapon attachments, keep compatibility in mind. Just because you found a suppressor doesn’t mean it’ll work on every weapon in your arsenal. Some suppressors are only designed for pistols, for instance. </p><p>To equip an attachment from your inventory, hold down T on keyboard or Up on the controller d-pad to open the weapon attachments menu. Here, you can select which piece to equip.On PC, you can also the weapon in your inventory and select an attachment from the drop-down menu.</p><h2 id="h176489"><a id="upgrade"></a>Weapon Upgrades Are A Boon</h2><figure id="" data-id="b15f03c0f61d5436eb8588c7e5f06427" data-recommend-id="image://b15f03c0f61d5436eb8588c7e5f06427" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The weapon upgrade menu in Stalker 2: Heart of Chornobyl shows an AKM-74S being worked on." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="The weapon upgrade menu in Stalker 2: Heart of Chornobyl shows an AKM-74S being worked on." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->GSC Game World / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="b15f03c0f61d5436eb8588c7e5f06427" data-recommend-id="image://b15f03c0f61d5436eb8588c7e5f06427" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The weapon upgrade menu in Stalker 2: Heart of Chornobyl shows an AKM-74S being worked on." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Now that you have a fully repaired weapon with attachments equipped, it’s time to upgrade it to increase its stats.

Depending on how much you’re willing to spend and the upgrade path you’d like to take, you can focus on increasing aiming speed, reducing spread, or bolstering penetration capabilities.

While Sonic, Knuckles, and jetpack-wearing Tails all look fine running through the forests of Green Hill, it’s the line-up of both Robotniks, Shadow, and Agent Stone that’s odd. There’s a noticeable gap between Stone and Robotnik that looks strange from a shot composition standpoint. If <em>Sonic the Hedgehog 3 </em>is an adaptation of <em>Sonic Adventure 2</em>, there’s one major player who appears absent from the film: Rouge the Bat.</p><p>The treasure-hunting double-agent acts as Knuckles’ rival in the Dreamcast game, and it’s a bummer that she doesn’t appear to be in the movie that adapts her debut alongside Shadow.

From what we can see in the trailer, it looks like Shadow himself is the weapon’s energy source this time around. The Chaos Emeralds were used in the second movie, but haven’t been shown in the trailers for <em>Sonic the Hedgehog 3</em> yet. So this might be one of the embellishments the movie is taking with the source material, although there is reason to believe the Chaos Emeralds will appear elsewhere in the movie.

This plot beat has become kind of a meme at this point, as most <em>Sonic </em>games that follow don’t reflect it. Sega tried to explain this as the moon having turned, so every time we see it in subsequent games we’re just seeing the side that isn’t broken.

He remarks about how dark the plans are getting, and we even see him roughed up alongside civilians as he looks on at the carnage Shadow and Eggman are causing.

It seems like they’re fighting at a volcanic eruption site. There are two important shots that fans think might imply something big for the climactic fight: At one point, we get a close-up on Sonic’s eyes, which, if you look closely, reflect multi-colored light that could be the Chaos Emeralds. There’s another shot where you can briefly see what looks like a golden streak of energy dashing past the volcanic eruptions.</p><p>Fans think this might mean Sonic and Shadow may use the Chaos Emeralds to change into their Super forms. In the <em>Sonic Adventure 2</em> game, Sonic and Shadow change into their Super Saiyan-like forms to team up and reverse Gerald’s plan to destroy the world, but it would be a twist if we got two superpowered hedgehogs facing each other in the final moments. Along with the conspicuous space in the Team Dark line-up, it does imply the movie may still have surprises in store when <em>Sonic the Hedgehog 3 </em>premieres on December 20.</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="79574862f6e0ec658dd15f16086c266a" data-recommend-id="image://79574862f6e0ec658dd15f16086c266a" data-format="gif" data-width="800" data-height="450" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Eggman sees Gerald dressed as Santa and tackles him in a hug." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Eggman sees Gerald dressed as Santa and tackles him in a hug." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Gif<!-- -->: <!-- -->Paramount / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="79574862f6e0ec658dd15f16086c266a" data-recommend-id="image://79574862f6e0ec658dd15f16086c266a" data-format="gif" data-width="800" data-height="450" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Eggman sees Gerald dressed as Santa and tackles him in a hug." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>The final scene in the trailer is a gag between both Robotniks, with Gerald shown dressed up as Santa Claus as his grandson excitedly tackles him into a Christmas tree.

Maybe Eggman is thinking of all the childhood family time he missed out on that made him the way he is. Or maybe <em>Sonic 3</em> has a Christmas subplot.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
