              <p>A contingent of right-wing online figures and their followers have been using the recent assassination of conservative podcaster Charlie Kirk to punish people they don’t like. That includes a developer at <em>Ghost of Yotei</em> maker Sucker Punch Productions who Sony confirms it has parted ways with after she made a joke on social media about the shooting.</p> <p>“I hope the shooter’s name is Mario so that Luigi knows his bro got his back,” Drew Harrison, a nearly 10-year veteran of the PlayStation studio, posted in the evening after Kirk was shot and killed during a speaking event at Utah Valley University. A few hours later, the post was screen-grabbed and shared by anti-woke crusader Mark “Grummz” Kern.</p> <p>“Suckerpunch Senior Dev celebrates Charlie Kirk’s death,” he wrote. “<em>Ghost of Yotei</em> is dead to me now.” A streamer who goes by Madamsavvy responded, “No more. Cowards keep quiet. The studio deserves to go under.” Kern replied, “No mercy.”</p>

 <p>Harrison subsequently shared on social media that people had been contacting her employer angrily trying to get her fired, and posted a screenshot of a barrage of missed calls from anonymous numbers as evidence of an ongoing harassment campaign. Less than 24 hours later, she was fired.</p> <p>“If standing up against fascism is what cost me my dream job I held for 10 years, I would do it again 100x stronger,” she wrote.</p> <p>Sony confirmed her departure in an email to <em>Kotaku</em> but declined to comment further. “Drew Harrison is no longer an employee of Sucker Punch Productions,” a spokesperson from Sony Interactive Entertainment wrote.</p>

The big PS5 exclusive has been in anti-woke activists’ firing line ever since <em>Ghost of Yotei</em> revealed the open-world samurai series’ latest entry would star a woman named Atsu, played by Erika Ishii.</p> <p>Fed by an algorithmically juiced YouTube rage factory, certain online culture content creators latched onto one of Ishii’s past comments about abolishing the police as a way to attack the game. Videos with titles like “<em>Ghost of Yōtei</em> DOOMED? Radical Activist Erika Ishii Brings Woke Chaos!” later changed to things like “<em>Ghost Of Yotei</em> New Trailer Sparks BACKLASH, Hiring Activists Backfires For Sony &amp; Sucker Punch” as YouTubers combed LinkedIn for evidence proving that people with opinions they disagreed with were ruining games.</p>

 <p><em>Ghost of Yotei</em> is far from the only high-profile blockbuster game to be dragged into this culture war quicksand. Kern and others attacked Ubisoft’s <em>Assassin’s Creed Shadows</em> as well for featuring an African samurai as one of its two main characters. Developers on the game were <a href="https://kotaku.com/assassins-creed-shadows-antiwoke-ubisoft-rpg-1851770511">reportedly told not to comment</a> on the harassment campaign when the game launched earlier this year.</p> <p>While Ubisoft CEO Yves Guillemot condemned attacks targeting employees, he also said at the time the company was working on “tackling the dynamics behind the polarized comments around Ubisoft so as to protect the Group’s reputation and maximize our game’s sales potential.”</p> <p>Members of the harassment campaign to get Harrison fired from Sucker Punch are already targeting individuals at other game studios and publishers over their social media comments. “Every single studio is compromised,” one of them wrote. “And it’s all American leftists doing this.”</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>In August, the <em>Battlefield 6</em> open beta was a massive success and one of the most played games of the year. But there was a <a href="https://kotaku.com/oh-thank-god-the-battlefield-6-open-beta-is-back-2000617797#:~:text=While%20some%20players,in%20the%20game.">controversial “quick turn” setting</a> included in the beta that caused some debate online. And when I asked the devs why it was added, they said: Balance and customization.</p> <p>Earlier this week, <em>Kotaku</em> sat down with two <em>Battlefield 6</em> devs to discuss the game’s console ports, and I had to ask about the <a href="https://x.com/TheTacticalBrit/status/1953513296042053713">quick turn feature</a>. People online suggested it looked like cheating and was too OP. Others claimed it helped balance <em>BF6</em> by giving controller players a chance to turn around quickly. According to&nbsp;Matthew Nickerson, senior console combat designer on <em>Battlefield 6,</em> balancing the game was indeed one reason it was added.</p> <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">This is a must have setting in <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/Battlefield6?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#Battlefield6</a> Flick Look allows you to achieve an instant quick 180 in combat! <a href="https://t.co/ElMW1yvrhh">pic.twitter.com/ElMW1yvrhh</a></p> <p>— TacticalBrit (@TheTacticalBrit) <a href="https://twitter.com/TheTacticalBrit/status/1953513296042053713?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">August 7, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <p><span>“The inherent issue of including aim assist on controller,” Nickerson told <em>Kotaku</em>,&nbsp; “[is that] you constantly are doing a big sweeping motion [while looking around], you’re constantly going full speed, and then you hit the bubbles of aim assist, and it automatically slows down. So you’re kind of constantly fighting these systems that are preventing you from quickly 180 turning.”</span></p>

 <p>Adding a quick flip option was a “huge win” that solved a “lot of issues” that exist when playing on a controller against mouse and keyboard players.</p> <p><span>“You know, you get shot in the back [and] it’s frustrating to be a controller player those days,” added Nickerson.&nbsp;</span></p> <p>According to him, making sure crossplay was balanced, fair, and fun was a huge goal for the entire team working on <em>Battlefield 6</em>. So the quick turn option, officially known as “Flick Stick,” was one more way to keep crossplay competitive for all.</p>

 <p>The other reason for adding it? Well, because it’s cool and gives players one more way to customize their controls and gameplay. And combined with the PS5’s gyro controls, Flick Stick can do some “really cool stuff.” Plus, Nickerson told <em>Kotaku</em> it helps give console players more ways to interact with the game despite gamepads having far fewer buttons than a keyboard.</p> <p><span>“If you want to reload [or turn around], maybe you just flick on your controller upright, and it activates the gyro, so it’s like</span><span> another new layer of customizability,” said Nickerson.&nbsp;</span></p> <p>I’m not sure I’ll be using gyro controls in <em>Battlefield 6</em> when it launches on October 10 on PS5, Xbox Series, and PC. But you’d better believe I’ll have a button set for turning around instantly so I can at least I can see the person killing me from behind.</p>
