Almost impossibly “expensive” to use, the system has measures in place presumably meant to prevent real-money markets and scalpers, but they’ve led to a system that is so punitive to players as to be useless. Thankfully, developers Creatures, Inc. and DeNA have since released a statement saying they recognize all is not OK.</p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="196165" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="What’s Coming Out Beyond Pokémon: The Indigo Disk | The Week In Games" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="95" data-playlist="196165,194741,196790" data-current="196165"><div><p>What’s Coming Out Beyond Pokémon: The Indigo Disk | The Week In Games</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196165/196165_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196165/196165_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196165/196165_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196165/196165_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/21711.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p><em>Pocket</em>’s trading is a ghastly mess. If you want to trade, say, a single one-star rarity card (typically a non-ex full-art card), you’ll require 400 trade tokens, which presently can only be gained by <em>destroying</em> four other one-star cards. Then, to trade for a card you actually want, you need to be in direct communication with the other person outside of the application, as there’s no way to communicate such information within. It’s very poor, and thank goodness, the negative reaction appears to have been heard.</p><p>“Since releasing the first iteration of the trading feature a few days ago,” <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://x.com/PokemonTCGP/status/1885447974094070090&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://x.com/PokemonTCGP/status/1885447974094070090" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">says a statement from the developers via X</a></span>, “we have received a large number of comments. Thank you all for sharing your feedback.”</p><p>The statement goes on to explain that the “requirements and restrictions” are there to prevent bots and malfeasance, and all this was done out of a desire to “maintain a fair environment for all players.” But, they go on, “we understand that some of the restrictions put in place are preventing players from being able to casually enjoy the feature as intended.” The developers are now investigating ways to improve things, as well as promising more ways to accrue trade tokens, “including through event distributions.”</p><p>What’s so interesting here is how this obnoxiously terrible feature was so obviously flawed. People didn’t discover the design’s issues through extensive experimentation, nor did they only show up once a large audience was participating. Instead it was, at a glance, blatantly horrible. You needed to destroy swathes of your most precious cards to be able to get a single new one, and you couldn’t just click a button to say which card you wanted in return! The developers <em>had</em> to know it was awful—it’s inconceivable that they could not.</p><p>Yet trading is extremely tricky ground for <em>Pokémon</em>. With the real-life versions of the cards, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/pokemon-tcg-prismatic-evolutions-prices-umbreon-1851747243&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-tcg-prismatic-evolutions-prices-umbreon-1851747243">as we’ve been reporting for a while</a></span>, prices for the rarest new cards are hitting all-time highs—we’re talking $1,500 for a single card from the most recent set. Being physical objects, the cards are beyond the ability of The Pokémon Company International (TPCi) and Creatures to impinge on such resale markets, and they can only exercise any level of control by producing more product for people to buy. But here, in this digital-only realm, there was a presumed ability to prevent such a secondhand market growing out of control.</p><p>The problem is, there isn’t an elegant or reasonable way to allow a pleasant in-game trading mechanic that cannot be exploited by third-party marketplaces. If it exists in any practical way, it will immediately be exploited by those wishing to more easily secure the specific cards they want, and those wishing to take people’s money to allow them to do so. The only solution is to create an in-app version of the feature that’s as good as anything anyone’s offering externally, rather than making the act of trading so actively unpleasant and punishing that no one would ever want to pay to do it.</p><p>Oddly enough, TPCi <em>has</em> done this successfully before! The original digital version of the <em>Pokémon</em> trading card game, <em>PTCG Online</em>, had a fantastic in-app trading function. You publicly listed the card you were offering and the card you wanted in exchange, and then anyone else could search for the card <em>they</em> want, and see if they had the requested trade. Click, boom, done. For reasons TPCi has chosen never to divulge, the trading feature was removed entirely <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/pokemon-tcg-live-online-migrate-card-game-tips-guide-1849789809&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-tcg-live-online-migrate-card-game-tips-guide-1849789809">when the forced switch to the poorer replacement app, <em>PTCG Live</em>, was implemented.</a></span></p><p>So it’s good news that feedback has been heard, but it remains very unlikely that trading will ever become the feature people have hoped for in <em>Pocket</em>, given the seeming reluctance to allow any sort of third-party marketplace. Let’s hope it at least makes a significant improvement. In the meantime, it seems, the app will find new ways to hand out piles of trading tokens.</p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
