              <p>In one of GameStop’s many scrambles to stay alive beyond its memestock status, <a href="https://kotaku.com/gamestop-gme-pokemon-card-trade-ins-psa-charizard-1851470574">the stores began buying graded <em>Pokémon TCG</em> cards last year</a>. Now the company has found a way to sell them back to you, but in a wildly bad mystery box deal.</p> <p>GameStop’s attempt to behave like your local TCG store could only ever have been a bizarre corporate pastiche of the concept. When you go to your local independent card shop and trade in your pulls, they’ll usually give you a fair price that still leaves decent room for the store to resell them at a profit. When GameStop started doing it, it was <a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-card-trade-in-gamestop-youtube-leonhart-1851489326">without providing the staff with the necessary training and expertise</a>, and naturally saw them paying woefully low prices, and of course without any of the individual stores having any independence over how it was carried out. The result of all that is now far more clear: for the last three months, GameStop has been selling graded cards back to customers in the form of mystery boxes, with the second phases of this initiative just launched. And wow, they’re not worth it.</p> <p>Three months ago, the incredibly popular Pokémon YouTuber PokeRev <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PqGiE5hz7zI">opened the first wave of these mystery boxes</a>, called GameStop Power Packs. At that point, these $60 boxes contained three “random” booster packs plus one PSA-graded card, at a grade of 8 or higher. The boxes showed an image of a Lost Origin Giratina V alt-art in a grade 10, which <a href="https://www.pricecharting.com/game/pokemon-lost-origin/giratina-v-186?q=giratina+v+186">today would cost you over $1,600</a>. That’d sure be nice to find. But just like the infamously terrible Walmart equivalent MJ Holding mystery boxes which do the same daft trick of putting extraordinarily rare packs on their boxes, that’s not what you’re likely to discover inside.</p>

 <p>To be fair to GameStop, their presentation is at least a little nicer–Walmart’s mystery boxes are flimsy cardboard with the various items rattling loose inside. GameStop’s go the other way, with so much of the cost clearly going into the sturdy box, folding lid, and bespoke foam inset. But yeah, the chances of finding $60-worth of goodies inside seems incredibly slim.</p> <p>This second wave of Power Packs has maintained the $60 price, but now only have two booster packs instead of three! Those packs, as revealed in PokeRev’s latest video on the boxes, seem to be two of Surging Sparks, 151, or Journey Together. That’s about $10 to $15 worth. The graded cards then seem to come in around $15 to $30, meaning most boxes will get you contents worth from half to two-thirds of what you paid. Which…sucks! $60 for $30 of cards.</p> <p><iframe loading="lazy" title="Gamestop's New Power Packs are Kinda Weird" width="500" height="281" src="about:blank" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen="" data-rocket-lazyload="fitvidscompatible" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/irST4sbj3Yg?feature=oembed"></iframe></p> <p>There is, of course, the chance that the packs could contain a valuable card, but it’s not high, and no better than just buying the packs themselves for their actual price. The one positive I can find is that at least the PSA-graded cards aren’t just bulk. From watching plenty of those MJ Holding boxes getting opened that contain graded cards, those will very often feature a grade 7 generic card from a recent set, worth far, far less than it would have cost to grade it in the first place. Instead, what’s shown for GameStop’s seem to be at least some classic cards from the early 00s, both Japanese and English, even if they themselves aren’t worth more than small change.</p> <p>We don’t know if these PSA cards are solely sourced from what’s been sold to GameStop stores over the last year, or if the company is buying them in bulk from other suppliers, but a combination of the two would make most sense. Either way, given the stores will have paid far less than they’re worth when they’re traded in, and are then being sold back in boxes that the majority of the time charge twice as much as the contents are worth, it’s clearly a very profitable venture for the company. But it’s definitely not one worth spending your money on. You’re far better off visiting your local independent store, or buying graded cards from trusted online marketplaces, so you can be sure you’re spending your money on the card you really want.</p>

              <p>Nintendo <a href="https://kotaku.com/switch-2-price-hike-nintendo-inflation-tariffs-2000614220">quietly raised the price</a> of almost every piece of gaming hardware and accessory it sells over the weekend, with the Switch 2 itself being one of the few exceptions. <a href="https://x.com/ZhugeEX/status/1951281524642386119">Some experts</a> believe it’s only a matter of time before the <em>Mario Kart World</em> machine gets more expensive too, thanks to <a href="https://kotaku.com/switch-2-preorder-tariff-price-trump-nintendo-1851775491">ongoing tariffs</a>, but for now here’s the full list of all of Nintendo’s latest price hikes on 8-year-old consoles and more that went into effect starting August 3.</p> <h2>Consoles</h2> <ul> <li>Switch Lite: $230 (was $200)</li> <li>Switch Standard: $340 (was $300)</li> <li>Switch OLED: $400 (was $350)</li> </ul> <h2>Controllers</h2> <ul> <li>NES Switch Online: $70 (was $60)</li> <li>SNES Switch Online: $30 (was $35</li> <li>Genesis Switch Online: $55 (was $50)</li> <li>N64 Switch Online: $55 (was $50)</li> <li>GameCube Switch Online: $70 (was $65)</li> <li>Switch 1 Joy-Con: $90 (was $80)</li> <li>Switch 1 Pro: $80 (was $70)</li> <li>Switch 2 Joy-Con: $95 (was $90)</li> <li>Switch 2 Pro: $90 (was $85)</li> </ul> <h2>Other accessories</h2> <ul> <li>Amiibo: $20 (was $16)</li> <li>Switch 2 Dock: $125 (was $120)</li> </ul> <p>The Switch 2 has escaped the latest round of price increases for now and still sits at $450. If anything, the latest move should help spur more people to upgrade now that the older consoles are closer in price and the Switch 2 is only likely to go up in price rather than down as was common in previous console generations. The impact of <a href="https://kotaku.com/switch-2-ps5-prices-trump-tariffs-china-nintendo-sony-1851704901">President Trump’s trade war tariffs</a> on accessories, however, is particularly rough. Controllers tend to break more quickly than the consoles themselves (especially if you have small kids). This is already the second price hike the Switch 2 Joy-Con and controller have received this year. Both are now more expensive than even the Switch 2’s priciest games. I’ll be taking extra special care of mine.</p>

              <p>Nintendo has been contacting some customers with a survey link, asking questions that are primarily focused on people’s thoughts about physical versus digital games, and especially the Switch 2’s game carts that <a href="https://kotaku.com/switch-2-key-card-game-cart-physical-list-confirmed-1851777742">don’t actually contain the game</a>. The <a href="https://nintendoofamerica.co1.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_e54yuThgl5J1nnM">link for the survey</a> is being <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/NintendoSwitch/comments/1mgrkzm/here_is_nintendos_survey_about_physical_and/">widely shared</a>, and while it’s not clear if Nintendo will properly log responses from those who weren’t deliberately contacted, the company is sure to notice the sheer volume of attention it’s receiving.</p> <p>“Imagine you are purchasing a new Nintendo Switch or Nintendo Switch 2 game for yourself,” the survey asks at one point before describing different ways publisher distributes games. These include, “Physical, requiring digital download,” which is described as, “The physical cartridge allows the download of a full digital game to the console. The cartridge must be inserted into the console to play the game. The cartridge can be shared and resold.” People can then respond to this notion with options ranging from “Definitely would buy” to “Definitely would not buy.” Whichever you choose, it’ll ask you why you made that decision, with a box to type your answer into. It then asks the same of buying games for others as gifts. “Because I don’t want to buy someone the idea of a game,” a person might type.</p> <p>The Switch 2’s “game key cards” have proven extremely controversial since the notion was announced. Last week’s <a href="https://kotaku.com/nintendo-direct-switch-2-key-cards-persona-3-octopath-1851787455">desultory Nintendo Direct re-ignited this frustration</a>, with a series of previously revealed games that people struggled to find enthusiasm for, made worse by the knowledge that so many would be game key cards–in other words, fake carts that simply contain an instruction for the console to download the game from the eStore.</p>

 <p>It’s tempting to view the game key cards as a step up from digital purchases, given you now have at least a physical object that can be resold or shared, and to some extent that’s true. However, it remains a hugely bad deal for customers, given that the cart will only work for as long as Nintendo maintains the servers it connects to. And given all of gaming history, that’s inevitably nowhere near as long as anyone would hope. As such, unlike your Game Boy cartridges from 1989 that will still work just as well today, all of these gameless key cards will be useless pieces of plastic in maybe twenty years’ time.</p> <p>As a result, people are leaping on this survey to express their views about this. Clearly Nintendo is aware it’s an issue, given that the survey is dominated by this topic. However, it’s unclear whether unsolicited responses will be counted by the company when survey company Qualtrics hands over the results. Even though the URL can be stripped of all its identifying details, there’s a chance it will still look for an ID that isn’t there and not count the response. But, and it’s a crucial but, given the attention this survey is now getting, and the press coverage responding to that, it’s impossible that Nintendo won’t at the very least notice the level of reaction. Heck, it’s all we’ve got. It seems worth a try.</p>

              <p>2006 action-RPG <em>Titan Quest</em> has never really gone away, thanks to a combination of DLC, re-releases, a mobile version from DotEmu, belated console ports, and expansions released as recently as 2021. It remains incredibly playable today, a game I personally return to every few years, a friendly, approachable <em>Diablo</em>-like. It turns out, however, that there’s now a sequel?! <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bY6yb8OoFvw">Announced a year ago</a>, but barely ever talked about,&nbsp;<em>Titan Quest II</em> entered early access Friday 1 August.</p> <p>Released almost 20 years ago in 2006,&nbsp;<em>Titan Quest</em> was the first and last project made by Iron Lore Entertainment–a studio set up by <em>Age of Empires</em>‘ co-designer Brian Sullivan–an action-RPG set within Greek and Egyptian mythology. And crucially, it was an action-RPG released midway through the enormous, aching twelve-year gap between <em>Diablo II</em> and&nbsp;<em>Diablo III</em>. It perfectly delivered a lower-intensity, more easily accessible loot-hoovering click-fest, and I dearly loved it. <a href="https://kotaku.com/diablo-4-action-rpg-blizzard-torchlight-path-of-exile-1850506636/3#content">Still love it, in fact</a>. So much so that just a few nights ago–entirely unaware that <em>Titan Quest II</em> even existed–I suggested that my 10-year-old give the original a go on his Android tablet, given the game and its many DLCs are all free on Play Pass. He’s been playing it obsessively ever since, fueled by his love of Greek mythology, his innate understanding of game systems…and his love for hitting stuff with sticks.</p> <p>It was only because of him that I even learned <em>Titan Quest II</em> existed, let alone had released into early access. He got me to start the original game over on my own tablet, and was then boasting that he was a higher level than me. Can’t have that. So I re-installed the game on my PC to see what saves I had. Sadly, everything from the original preceded even Steam, let alone cloud saves, but fortunately I at least had a low-level character still higher than his own on the <em>Tenth Anniversary Edition</em>. And in the process of putting him in his place, I noticed “<em>Titan Quest II</em>” coming up as a search result. I assumed it was some sort of wishful thinking, checked it out, and, er, it’s a thing!</p>

 <p><iframe loading="lazy" title="Titan Quest II | Early Access Release Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="about:blank" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen="" data-rocket-lazyload="fitvidscompatible" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ikmiyR8rutw?feature=oembed"></iframe></p> <p>It’s honestly just weird not to have heard this game was coming. Even though I have a few massive gaps in my perception, as a games critic I tend to have a decent idea what’s in development–but the fact I was unaware of a sequel to one of my all-time favorite games remains just weird. Then again, a similar sentiment was shared on Reddit’s r/ARPG earlier this year, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ARPG/comments/1ja4xm5/how_in_the_hell_is_no_one_in_here_talking_about/">with a post titled</a> “How in the hell is no one here talking about <em>Titan Quest 2</em> Playtest?” No one there continued to talk about it.</p> <p>It perhaps doesn’t help that it’s nothing to do with the original game. While 2006’s&nbsp;<em>Titan Quest</em> was published by THQ, that company ceased to properly exist in 2013 when it went spectacularly bankrupt, auctioning off all its licenses. Eventually the trademark was bought by Nordic Games, the company that would go on to be called Embracer Group, and THQ Nordic remains a publishing arm that handles a lot of former THQ properties. Also, developer Iron Lore is long gone, unable to secure funding for a second game in 2008, with a bunch of the developers going on to form Crate Entertainment, creators of the wildly successful <em>Grim Dawn</em>. Instead <em>Titan Quest II</em> is developed by Grimlore Games, a studio created by Nordic Games in 2013, but that has since only released a barely noticed remake of <em>Spellforce III</em>. It’s all so strange!</p> <p>I’ve just started playing, and honestly, after barely 15 minutes, I’m delighted! This looks and feels like&nbsp;<em>Titan Quest</em>, but updated in a bunch of useful ways. I will continue on and report back in much more detail soon.</p>
