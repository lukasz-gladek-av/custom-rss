              <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-shiny-odds-scarlet-violet-ivs-red-gyarados-1850248457"><span>Shiny hunting</span></a><span> is a beloved pastime for many </span><i><span>Pokémon </span></i><span>fans. Finding these rare critters with different shades and color palettes than their species’ default appearance is such an involved undertaking with secret math and other nonsense to contend with that some people spend hours looking for just one of these guys. Others spend even longer trying to find one of every ‘mon in the Pokédex. </span><i><span>Pokémon Legends: Z-A </span></i><span>is out today, and players have discovered the RPG has made one crucial change to Shiny hunting that has taken some of the difficulty out of this process, and while some fans are rejoicing, others are lamenting how much easier it’s gotten to capture these alternate-colored Pokémon.</span></p> <p><span>When you enter </span><i><span>Legends: Z-A</span></i><span>’s Wild Zones, designated areas where wild Pokémon live and can be captured, typically every monster you encounter is refreshed when the game’s day and night cycle changes, your party is knocked out, or if you fast travel. However, that doesn’t seem to be the case for Shinies. Players have tested this on Pokémon they’ve found in the overworld, and it seems like, unless you defeat it in battle, Shiny Pokémon don’t despawn.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">I found a Shiny Magikarp. I changed to nighttime to make it disappear and back to daytime and it was still there. </p> <p>I fast traveled away and back and it was still there. </p> <p>I had my character knocked out and came back and it was still there. </p> <p>Enjoy <a href="https://t.co/tA42rUM9iv">pic.twitter.com/tA42rUM9iv</a></p> <p>— SBCoop (@SBCoop89) <a href="https://twitter.com/SBCoop89/status/1978582662752178301?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 15, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">LZA has special behavior to keep shiny Pokémon from despawning! This looks to be intentional. The game stashes up to 10 shiny Pokémon and keeps them from despawning if you leave the area.</p> <p>Essentially, nonshinies are rerolled but shinies are not, as you can see here in this clip. <a href="https://t.co/FHo3uqAR7R">pic.twitter.com/FHo3uqAR7R</a></p> <p>— Anubis (@Sibuna_Switch) <a href="https://twitter.com/Sibuna_Switch/status/1978821040026329409?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 16, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">can confirm this too! 🤯</p> <p>I thought i accidentally depsawned a shiny cuz the sound played after i was already walking up the stairs to a new area – went back down and it was still there!!</p> <p>love that they added a shiny failsafe! this is HUGE<a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/PokemonLegendsZA?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#PokemonLegendsZA</a> <a href="https://t.co/0OroFXjVuc">https://t.co/0OroFXjVuc</a> <a href="https://t.co/F6DG8XvvDk">pic.twitter.com/F6DG8XvvDk</a></p> <p>— Junzz (@junzztv) <a href="https://twitter.com/junzztv/status/1978640948528545830?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 16, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <p><span>This means that there’s now significantly less risk during Shiny hunting, as </span><i><span>Legends: Z-A </span></i><span>goes out of its way to make sure you have a chance to engage with these monsters before they disappear forever. It is still possible to lose out on a Shiny, though. If you knock it out or if you scare a skittish Pokémon off, that’s that. So </span><i><span>some </span></i><span>risk does remain.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><span>As Shiny hunting has become easier thanks to items like the Shiny Charm, which increases their (still minuscule) spawn rates, longtime fans have stopped seeing collecting these rare Pokémon as a badge of honor, while others are just glad that they’ve become less frustrating to catch. Missing out on a Shiny can feel devastating, and fucking it up may lead to </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-shiny-hunting-treecko-stream-two-reset-aelfgar-1851588124"><span>viral moments</span></a><span>, but would you rather have a funny story or a Shiny Pokémon in your collection?</span></p> <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">This isn't just a quality-of-life update. It's the death of a legend.</p> <p>The thrill of finding a shiny was always magnified by the heartbreaking risk of losing it.</p> <p>By removing the risk, they have guaranteed the reward.

Now, if a Shiny Pokémon spawns nearby, you’ll hear a short jingle to signal to you that it’s somewhere in your vicinity. It always felt weird that </span><i><span>Scarlet </span></i><span>and </span><i><span>Violet </span></i><span>skipped out on a feature that was especially helpful for colorblind players who might not be able to clock a Shiny at first glance, so it’s nice to see </span><i><span>Z-A </span></i><span>bring it back.</span></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div dir="auto" data-qa="message_content" role="presentation"> <p>Former EA developer and <em>Dead Space</em> creator Glen Schofield really wants to make a new game in the sci-fi horror series, and is apparently already calling Electronic Arts <a href="https://kotaku.com/ea-sale-saudi-arabia-madden-pif-jared-kushner-2000629829">following the news that Saudi Arabia</a>, with some help from private equity firms, is planning to buy up the <em>Battlefield</em> and <em>Madden</em> publisher.</p> <p>Schofield’s last big game was 2022’s <em>Dead Space</em>-like <a href="https://kotaku.com/callisto-protocol-review-dead-space-pc-ps5-goty-1849848054"><em>The Callisto Protocol</em>.</a> It wasn’t a smash hit, and <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/dead-space-co-creator-glen-schofield-leaves-the-callisto-protocols-striking-distance-studios">he left the studio he helped found</a> to build the game less than a year after shipping it<em>.</em> But he’s not done making games. He’s currently the director at Pinstripe Games, a studio that hasn’t announced what it’s working on, <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/i-can-save-you-30-40-million-on-the-idea-i-have-dead-space-creator-glen-schofield-already-making-calls-about-dead-space-4-now-ea-has-new-owners">and he also told<em> IGN</em></a> in a recent interview that he’s got “quite a few” ideas for more games, including<em> Dead Space 4</em>. But the last time Schofield went to the publisher to talk <em>Dead Space</em>, it wasn’t interested.</p> <p>“I went to [EA] recently and they’re like no, we’re not interested anymore,” Schofield told <em>IGN</em>. “I said, ‘I can get back the leadership team.’ I need the models from [<em>Dead Space</em> remake developer] EA Motive, and I can save you 30 to 40 million dollars on the idea that I have. And, they’re like, ‘no.'”</p> <p>But now that EA is set to be bought up by Saudi Arabia, <a href="https://kotaku.com/ea-saudi-arabia-deal-senate-union-banking-interest-rates-2000636023">assuming the United States government doesn’t get involved and block the deal</a>, Schofield thinks there’s a chance for <em>Dead Space 4</em> to happen, or at least for the franchise to be sold off and expanded into new media.</p> </div><p>“The fact that EA just got bought, I think there’s an opportunity. I’m already making calls. I don’t know where EA’s head is right now. I don’t think they made money on [the remake]. <em>Dead Space</em> needs to be adapted to different mediums — movies, TV series, it would be great. But I am more optimistic [since the sale of EA], because somebody new could buy [IP].”</p></div><br/><br/>https://kotaku.com/dead-space-creator-sees-chance-make-dead-space-4-ea-saudi-deal-2000636125]]></content:encoded>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/destiny-2-expansion-cheap-sale-bundle-star-wars-2000636124</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/get-every-destiny-2-expansion-including-the-new-star-wars-one-for-just-35-right-now.1326835/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>The<em> Destiny 2</em> 2025 Charity Bundle is almost too good to pass up. I say almost because the actual state of the sci-fi MMO right now is so rough that this might be the <a href="https://kotaku.com/destiny-2-free-final-shape-edge-fate-expansion-ps5-1851785927">worst time to hop into Bungie’s loot shooter in years</a>. At the same time, the bundle includes every paid piece of content for the game, including the upcoming <em>Star Wars Renegades</em> expansion, for half the price of a new game.</p> <p>The <a href="https://www.greenmangamingbundles.com/bundles/destiny-2-expansion-bundle-2025/">charity bundle</a> is being sold in partnership with Green Man Gaming and is only for the PC version of the game, but the majority of the $35 price tag all goes to the Bungie Foundation which uses gaming to help children in need. Here’s everything included in the bundle:</p>

 <ul> <li><em>Destiny 2 </em>base game</li> <li><em>Forsaken Pack</em></li> <li><em>Bungie 30th Anniversary Pack</em></li> <li><em>Beyond Light</em></li> <li><em>Shadowkeep</em></li> <li><em>Witch Queen</em></li> <li><em>Lightfall</em></li> <li><em>The Final Shape</em></li> <li><em>The Edge of Fate</em></li> <li><em>Renegades</em></li> </ul> <p>That’s everything there is to play currently (the original story campaign and other content were sunset years ago). It’s a great deal, and the only thing stopping me from recommending it to everyone I know is that <em>Destiny 2</em> tends to live and die by the most recent expansion, and 2025’s <em>The Edge of Fate</em> is one of its worst. That’s infected the rest of the loot shooter with changes to the grind, gear, and progression that make the entire game <a href="https://kotaku.com/destiny-2-renegades-star-wars-power-reset-2000632488">a drag right now</a>. Bungie responded with a series of fixes, including promises to roll back some of the most controversial changes, but that requires placing a bet on <em>Destiny 2</em>‘s future rather than investing in its present.</p> <p>The addition of <em>Renegades</em> is the one big silver lining for this bundle. The <a href="https://kotaku.com/star-wars-destiny-2-renegades-trailer-release-date-1851779376"><em>Star Wars</em>-themed expansion</a> is teasing some interesting ideas and new modes. At the very least, there will be a lightsaber sword everyone can obtain and mess around with. And if <em>Renegades</em> doesn’t help right the ship, well, I’m not sure anything will. So if nothing else, consider the charity bundle a super-cheap ticket to witness the rebirth of <em>Destiny 2</em>. Or, if things don’t turn around, its eventual end.</p>
