            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Capcom Cup 12, with its finals scheduled for March of next year, is set to be the first pay-per-view livestream for a major <em>Street Fighter</em> tournament. On Friday, however, the Japanese publisher might change how much it charges players to watch it. That’s in response to <a href="https://kotaku.com/street-fighter-6-capcom-cup-12-ppv-ticket-price-2000630340">a furious backlash</a> from fans and competitive pros alike to what would be a controversial milestone for professional esports.</p> <p>“Currently, we are considering price adjustments for the paid live viewing,” Capcom announced on X earlier today, according to the platforms’ auto-translation. “We plan to make another announcement regarding the pricing of live viewing tickets, as well as the background and intent behind it, by late October.”</p>

 <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="ja" dir="ltr">＜カプコンeSportsイベント 有料チケットに関するお知らせ＞<br>本日より「CAPCOM CUP 12」「ストリートファイターリーグ: ワールドチャンピオンシップ 2025」の国技館の会場観戦チケットの抽選販売受付を開始いたします。</p> <p>▼詳しくはこちら▼<a href="https://t.co/UdNZJzoxUf">https://t.co/UdNZJzoxUf</a>…</p> <p>— CAPCOM eSports (@CAPCOM_eSports) <a href="https://twitter.com/CAPCOM_eSports/status/1976528542889545892?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 10, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <p>While fans can pay to attend the tournament live in-person, they’ll also have to pay to watch it live online. Right now the ticket price is $40 for two days of matches. That’s as much as it currently costs to buy <em>Street Fighter 6</em>. While some fans are against Capcom charging at all, others might be satisfied if the publisher simply lowers the price, or rolls the ticketing into a broader package that also includes in-game cosmetics.</p>

 <p>Capcom’s retreat comes a week after S<em>treet Fighter 6</em> director Takayuki Nakayama confirmed on social media that the development team was not consulted about the pay-per-view pricing for the more than $1 million prize pool event. “It may sound strange, but it’s true,” he <a href="https://x.com/takaNakayama/status/1973626143187280262">wrote</a>. “Revenue targets and assigned tasks differ fundamentally by department. Even the development team was surprised by this announcement. (At least Matsumoto and I were shocked at the venue). That said, since this matter occurred within the same company, we are currently discussing it. We apologize for any concern this may have caused.”</p>

 <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">For example, the initiatives we implemented in the previous title. That was a proposal from the development team—it was tough but fun.<br>Since then, the organization has grown significantly, and various departments have been established.<br>My main responsibilities now are improving…</p> <p>— TAKA-nakayama (@takaNakayama) <a href="https://twitter.com/takaNakayama/status/1973633016691040448?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 2, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <p>He also confirmed that there was no discussions about including tickets for the livestream in add-on content for the game, like a World Championship costume set. Nakayama even added that he’d delete his post if he got “scolded at work” for it. That clearly hasn’t happened.</p> <p>“We kindly ask for your patience until then,” Capcom told fans today. “We sincerely appreciate your continued support for Capcom eSports events.”</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Popular streamer Charles White Jr., aka Cr1TiKal/MoistCr1TiKaL, that long-haired dude who seems to be a pretty good person, has taken the unusual step of shutting off his YouTube memberships and Super Chats. Instead of prompting his viewers to throw money at the screen, he’s instead urging folks to donate to charity. “There are so many better options for your money,” he said.</p> <p>As <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/there-are-so-many-better-options-for-your-money-popular-streamer-turns-off-all-donation-tells-fans-to-give-to-charity/">first reported by <i>VGC</i></a>, White has posted a video announcing that he’s shut off user-donated monetization on his YouTube channel, and saying that he’d shut off Twitch subs as well if he could. “I would say toodle-oo, give it a strong slap on the ass, tell it good game and goodbye.” But apparently it’s harder than that. Still, he stressed that money spent on his stream could be put to better use:</p> <p>There are so many good charities doing extremely good work that could be benefited greatly from your contribution. Like maybe you’d want to donate to a charity that’s doing extremely important work in Gaza. That would be a significantly better use of that money than donating it to me.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/gaming-chair-elgato-herman-miller-embrace-elgato-2000634072</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/finally-a-gaming-chair-i-don%E2%80%99t-have-to-be-embarrassed-by.1322218/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Stuff for gamers tends to look…ridiculous. You’ve got all these sharp angles, and don’t get me started on the constant need to shove RBG LEDs into friggin’ everything. Well, in stark contrast to that trend,&nbsp; Elgato, makers of the Stream Deck, various capture cards, and other kit for streaming setups, has a new chair that looks almost too normal. And for a decent chair that’ll last you? It ain’t sitting at too terrible of a price.</p> <p><a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/798127/elgato-embrace-gaming-chair">As spotted by <i>The Verge</i></a>, Elgato’s new chair, the “Embrace,” comes in at $500 bucks and will be shipping this holiday season. It comes with all the design elements that make gaming chairs decent to sit in. For hours. Without moving. Staring at the screen with little urge to get up beyond necessary biological impulses.</p>

 <p>As Tom Warren at <i>The Verge </i>states, the Embrace seems to be going up against Herman Miller’s “<a href="https://store.hermanmiller.com/gaming-chairs/embody-gaming-chair/100160889.html?lang=en_US&amp;sku=100160889">Embody</a>” chair which, I’ll be honest, has a touch more personality with its color options. I’m really into the white and purple theme. Elegant, not overbearing. But wow, that thing costs almost $2,000. I’m sure it’ll save me back problems down the line, but if I’m spending that kinda money and it’s not for rent, it’s almost certainly for something completely irresponsible. Plus, do I want to be that girl who spent two grand on a chair?</p>

 <p>I’ve had the same rando-brand chair I bought on Amazon for like five years now. It cost $300, and has held up through my many fits of punching the arm rests while listening to Gojira or some other crazy shit. If I do decide upon the Embrace as my next gaming chair, I’ll be sure to let you know if you can beat the hell out of it. And how comfy it is.</p> <p>But seriously! Like even just a two-tone color option would have added at least some personality without making me feel like I need to hide it if I bring a guy over or something.</p>

              <p><span>The crossover characters and tracks are my least favorite thing about </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/sonic-racing-crossworlds-crossover-review-hatsune-miku-2000626583"><i><span>Sonic Racing: Crossworlds</span></i></a><span>, an otherwise excellent kart racer that didn’t need a bunch of licensed partnerships to stand out. That said, it doesn’t surprise me that the modding community has taken that concept and run with it. I do wish someone would add more </span><i><span>Sonic </span></i><span>characters, such as </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/sonic-movies-eggman-robotnik-agent-stone-stobotnik-gay-1851738189"><span>Agent Stone</span></a><span> from the </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/sonic-hedgehog-3-review-shadow-keanu-reeves-jim-carrey-1851726797"><span>live-action</span> <span>movies</span></a><span>, but it seems like modders have other ideas, like Jack Black’s Steve from </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/a-second-minecraft-movie-is-hitting-theaters-in-just-two-years-2000634000"><span>the </span><i><span>Minecraft </span></i><span>movie</span></a><span>. This is basically my worst nightmare.</span></p> <p><span>Steve, as he exists in the </span><i><span>Minecraft </span></i><span>games, is already in </span><i><span>Crossworlds </span></i><span>as DLC, but now you can play as his obnoxious film counterpart. The “Jack Black Steve Collection” mod on </span><a href="https://gamebanana.com/mods/625763"><span>GameBanana</span></a><span> comes courtesy of user BROCHONKY, who has added two skins for Jack Black’s character to </span><i><span>Crossworlds</span></i><span>. One is a photoscanned action figure that looks just like the actor, while the other is a stylized version of the character that uses </span><i><span>Minecraft</span></i><span>‘s signature blocky style. As a bonus, the mod also includes the infamous Chicken Jockey as it appears in the original game.</span></p>

 <p><span>The mod doesn’t just include skins, it also has voice lines and </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/minecraft-movie-lava-chicken-jockey-easter-egg-game-1851786345"><span>music from the movie</span></a><span>. Black’s trademark hammed-up delivery followed him into Overworld, so the movie has several soundbites that became memes, such as when he announces the Chicken Jockey’s arrival and says “flint and steel” while teaching the other characters to craft. All of this seems like the making of a troll character, but I also feel like hearing these voice lines repeatedly during races would rot your own brain, so you reap what you sow.&nbsp;</span></p>  <p><span>Sega is apparently cool with character mods, so Steve will live to Chicken Jockey another day. The company recently </span><a href="https://x.com/RaceCrossWorlds/status/1976175976720867553"><span>banned cheaters who used mods to win races</span></a><span>, but the company’s </span><a href="https://games.sega.com/eula/?lang=en"><span>End User License Agreement</span></a><span> explicitly encourages creative work like adding new characters to their games. If I see Jack Black Steve on the racetrack, I will be running him off a cliff expeditiously. </span></p>
