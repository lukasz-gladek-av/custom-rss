              <p>Here’s some good news for folks wanting an update on Sony’s previously announced <em>Helldivers</em> feature film. Justin Lin, best known for his work on the <em><a href="https://kotaku.com/the-17-moments-that-defined-the-fast-and-the-furious-1794341835">Fast &amp; Furious </a></em><a href="https://kotaku.com/the-17-moments-that-defined-the-fast-and-the-furious-1794341835">franchise</a><em><a href="https://kotaku.com/the-17-moments-that-defined-the-fast-and-the-furious-1794341835">,</a></em> is set to direct the cinematic adaptation of PlayStation and Arrowhead’s massively popular online co-op shooter.</p> <p>On December 1, <a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/movies/movie-news/helldivers-movie-justin-lin-sony-1236438370/"><em>The Hollywood Reporter</em> reported that Justin Lin is going to both direct and produce</a> the <em>Helldivers</em> movie via his Perfect Storm Entertainment media company. He’ll be working alongside PlayStation Productions on the live-action adaptation, which was first announced in January 2025.&nbsp;The upcoming Helldivers movie has a script written by <em>Annabelle</em> and <em>It</em> writer Gary Dauberman.</p>

 <p>Justin Lin is a perfect choice for <em>Helldivers</em>. He has experience working on big-budget action movies, having directed <em>The Fast And Furious: Tokyo Drift, Fast &amp; Furious 4, Fast Five, Fast &amp; Furious 6,</em> and <em>F9: The Fast Saga.</em> He also directed <em>Star Trek: Beyond,</em> the third and presumably last film in the JJ Abrams-produced modern Star Trek reboot trilogy. While the Fast movies can be over-the-top nonsense, the action and visuals within the movies are top-notch notch and each one is fast-paced. This resume feels like the perfect fit for Helldivers, especially with a solid script that leans into the absurd space-facism of the series.</p>

 <p><em>The Hollywood Reporter</em> says that Lin isn’t a gamer, but used that fact to his advantage when pitching his take on <em>Helldivers</em> to Sony and PlayStation. He reportedly wants to focus on the humanity in the characters and feature a “timely” story as well as build up what could be a future franchise for the studio.</p> <p>Meanwhile,<a href="https://kotaku.com/helldivers-2-horizon-zero-dawn-movie-ghost-tsushima-1851733809"> Sony has plenty of other PlayStation adaptations in the works</a>, including a <em>God of War</em> series, <em>Horizon: Zero Dawn</em> movie adaptations, and a <em>Ghost of Tsushima</em> anime spin-off. And let’s not forget the <em>Last of Us</em> series on HBO, which has proven to be a massive hit for all involved. Get ready, because this is just the start of Sony and other game studios digging into their vaults filled with old IP to find the next big blockbuster.</p>
