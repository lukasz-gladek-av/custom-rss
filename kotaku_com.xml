              <p>The rumors were true. Capcom’s blockbuster horror series is finding a new home on Switch 2. Not only will <a href="https://kotaku.com/re9-resident-evil-9-trailer-teaser-sgf-summer-game-fest-1851783941"><em>Resident Evil Requiem</em></a> be a day-one release on Nintendo’s portable console in February 2026, but <em>Resident Evil 7: Biohazard</em> and <em>Resident Evil Village</em> will be joining it as a collection on the same day.</p> <p>The Switch 2 trailer opened with <a href="https://kotaku.com/resident-evil-requiem-9-grace-trailer-gamescom-mother-2000618547">FBI agent Grace Ashcroft</a> investigating a series of murders in a spooky hotel amid one jumpscare after another. The footage appeared to be taken from a Switch 2 though the trailer didn’t immediately confirm that. If that’s the case, the ninth mainline <em>Resident Evil</em> isn’t looking too shabby on the weaker hardware.</p>  <p><em>Requiem</em> is out February 27, 2026 on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC as well. That’s also the day that some older <em>Resident Evil</em> games will finally make their way to Nintendo’s platform. Gold editions of Capcom’s <em>Resident Evil 7</em> and <em>Resident Evil Village</em>&nbsp;will both arrive then as well.</p>

 <p>These unexpected<em> Resident Evil</em> ports were rumored prior to today’s Nintendo Direct, with leakers suggesting the rest of the modern <em>Resident Evil</em> series, including remakes of <em>3</em> and <em>4</em> as well as <em>Resident Evil Village</em>, will arrive on Switch 2 eventually as well.</p> <p>While not confirmed, that fact that Capcom seems to be having so much success getting RE Engine games running on the new console is a good sign that we could see some of Capcom’s other blockbusters arrive on it, including maybe <em>Dragon’s Dogma 2</em> and <em>Monster Hunter Wilds</em>. The latter is still in rough shape even on PC, though, so we’ll have to wait and see.</p>
