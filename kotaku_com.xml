              <p>Good news: Sony just announced a new<a href="https://kotaku.com/ratchet-clank-rift-apart-the-kotaku-review-1847047303"><em> Ratchet &amp; Clank</em></a> game. Bad news: It’s some free-to-play mobile arena shooter thing.</p> <p>On November 12, PlayStation Studios and Insomniac announced <em>Ratchet &amp; Clank: Ranger Rumble</em>. The game is being created by OhBibi, <a href="https://www.ohbibi.com/games">a mobile game developer located in France</a> which&nbsp;has previously created cartoony, colorful action-focused third-person shooters. And what do you know, that’s exactly what<em> Ranger Rumble</em> appears to be in the game’s first trailer.</p>

  <p><a href="https://www.rangerrumble.com/?utm_source=SoftLaunch&amp;utm_medium=PreReg&amp;utm_campaign=Socials&amp;utm_id=RangerRumble_SoftLaunch">According to the upcoming game’s website</a>,<em> Ranger Rumble</em> will feature “iconic characters from the <span><em>Ratchet &amp; Clank</em> franchise” as well as big guns and explosions, which are hallmarks of the long-running series that started back on the PS2. PlayStation Studios describes <em>Ranger Rumble</em> as a “fast-paced multiplayer platformer arena shooter,” which, yeah, seems accurate.<br> </span></p>

 <p><span>“​</span>Experience the&nbsp;<span>humor, action</span>, and energy of the&nbsp;<span>iconic universe</span> in a bold new real-time multiplayer format,” says the game’s website. “Play as a Legendary Hero from the past, now with unique abilities. Go solo or team up with other Rangers online in <span>thrilling multiplayer games</span> built for every kind of player.”</p> <p>No release date was announced, but it is supposedly coming to mobile platforms “soon.” You can pre-register now.</p> <p>I think visually, <em>Ranger Rumble</em> looks great. It feels like a Saturday morning cartoon spin on the <em>Ratchet &amp; Clank</em> universe, and I’m here for that. However, I’ve tried multiple times to enjoy multiplayer shooters on mobile phones using touch controls, and I hate it. And sure, many of them let you plug in a controller and play that way, but at that point, I’d rather just play a game on PC or console. Perhaps <em>Ratchet &amp; Clank: Ranger Rumble</em> will eventually make the leap to PS4/PS5 and PC, but for now, I’m not sure I’ll play it. At least Sony hasn’t forgotten about<em> Ratchet &amp; Clank.</em> So that’s nice!</p> <p>This also lines up with past comments from <a href="https://kotaku.com/sony-ps5-playstation-jim-ryan-xbox-game-pass-activision-1850880301">former PlayStation CEO Jim Ryan</a>, <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/playstation-mobile-games-apps">who in 2021 explained in investor relations documents</a> that Sony was looking to invest more in mobile games based on famous franchises. I can’t wait for the <em>Sly Cooper</em> match-three game.</p>
