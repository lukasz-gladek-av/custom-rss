Everyone was constantly filming. There were apparently <em>a lot</em> of hot dogs and baby oil, seemingly the modern-day prank comedy equivalents of whoopee cushions and cream pies. “They had this prank where they made fake poop with fart spray and it had literally stank up our room to the point where my roommate’s eyes were tearing up,” said attendee Kieya Jennings, “There was water everywhere, baby oil, baby powder, noodles,” recalled Mari Franklin.<br></p><p>There are <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.twitch.tv/videos/2468531436?filter=all&amp;sort=time&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.twitch.tv/videos/2468531436?filter=all&amp;sort=time" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">over 10 hours of streams on Cenat’s Twitch channel</a></span> from the weekend-long saga, and many, many more from the channels of the individuals in attendance. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rzV_uc4RWsk&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rzV_uc4RWsk" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Comments on a video</a></span> for the final day’s awards ceremony were filled with nothing but love for the streaming world’s current master of ceremonies.

And that’s nice and all. But maybe you’re getting ready to buy a Nintendo Switch 2, and some games to go along with it. Or you’re trying to save money for some other reason. Thankfully, during each week of the sale, Epic is giving out free PC games. And this week’s games are the aforementioned <em>Wonderlands</em> and <em>Limbo</em>. </p><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://store.epicgames.com/en-US/free-games&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://store.epicgames.com/en-US/free-games" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Just a heads-up that these games will only be free until June 5</a></span>.

Since then, this creepy and minimalistic game has been ported to everything and is worth checking out, especially if you loved 2016's <em>Inside, </em>which was developed by the same folks. </p><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/tiny-tinas-wonderlands-borderlands-spinoff-impressions-1848705496&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/tiny-tinas-wonderlands-borderlands-spinoff-impressions-1848705496">Meanwhile, 2022's <em>Tiny Tina’s Wonderlands</em></a></span> is probably the exact polar opposite of <em>Limbo</em>. <em>Wonderlands </em>is a fantasy-themed <em>Borderlands </em>spin-off featuring melee weapons, magic, and a big overworld map. It’s a strange game, but one which I’ve played through twice and enjoyed thoroughly. If you like <em>Borderlands </em>and haven’t played this looter shooter spin-off yet, now is a great time to hop in. And if you’re excited about <em>Borderlands 4,</em> launching in September, <em>Wonderlands</em> will keep you busy until then. </p><p> .<br></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Given just 30 minutes’ notice before the news was announced by EA in an internal meeting, the studio had apparently just recently successfully passed one of its development milestones and was working toward a vertical slice that would show a chunk of the game in action. </p><p>The story reportedly revolved around playing as T’Challa, Killmonger, or Shuri as each vied for the mantle of Black Panther which would grant them superhuman powers. The game would also feature fights with the shapeshifting Skrull showcased in Marvel’s popular <em>Secret Invasion</em> comic-book crossover event. The gameplay was also aiming to incorporate elements of the Nemesis system from <em>Shadow of Mordor</em> such that enemies might remember past encounters with the player and relationships with aspiring Black Panther rivals might evolve. </p><p>It appears the most likely reason EA may have decided to walk away from the project was the lack of progress after several years of prototyping, even as some of those laid off in Cliffhanger Games’ closure had only just arrived at the studio earlier this year as it scaled up its development capabilities. Several developers spoke up about the project online this week following its cancelation. </p><p>“Well, it was a good run while it lasted,” <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.linkedin.com/posts/ted-snook-9235602_well-it-was-a-good-run-while-it-lasted-activity-7333598980263624704-tG2t/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=member_desktop&amp;rcm=ACoAAB9jAJMBKn6avI14nm0RQ2Himw8u2luEWC0&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/ted-snook-9235602_well-it-was-a-good-run-while-it-lasted-activity-7333598980263624704-tG2t/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=member_desktop&amp;rcm=ACoAAB9jAJMBKn6avI14nm0RQ2Himw8u2luEWC0" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">posted</a></span> software engineer Ted Snook. “Found out today that Cliffhanger Games is shut down by EA.
