              <p>Ridley Scott is one of the <a href="https://kotaku.com/ridley-scott-movies-ranked-gladiator-ii-1851701914">most prodigious directors</a> working in Hollywood right now. Every movie studio seems content to lavish him with massive budgets no matter how tenuous the pitch. But the filmmaker behind <em>Blade Runner</em> and other classics has grown unimpressed with what everyone else around him is producing. ‚ÄúThe quantity of movies that are made today, literally globally‚Äìmillions. Not thousands, millions,‚Äù he said during an interview this weekend. ‚ÄúAnd most of it is shit.‚Äù</p> <p>The choice comments came during a retrospective on his career at the BFI Southbank in London, <a href="https://deadline.com/2025/10/ridley-scott-hollywood-drowning-in-mediocrity-1236570875/"><em>Deadline</em> reports</a>. Scott, whose 2024 blockbuster <em>Gladiator II</em> at one point featured a mostly green-screened sea battle within a colosseum with massive sharks, lamented that too many bad films are ‚Äúsaved‚Äù with digital effects added in post-production instead of relying on solid scripts.</p>

 <p>Scott was asked if he has any movie comfort foods. Why yes, yes he does: his own movies.</p> <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">I watched Alien with his commentary last night and every other scene he said something along the lines of ‚Äúdamn that‚Äôs good‚Äù or ‚Äúit hasn't aged at all‚Äù and I just nodded in agreement every time. <a href="https://t.co/iYnYyBpZaj">https://t.co/iYnYyBpZaj</a></p> <p>‚Äî Barto (@bartonovopolis) <a href="https://twitter.com/bartonovopolis/status/1975050651299426475?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 6, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <p>‚ÄúWell, actually, right now, I‚Äôm finding mediocrity‚Äìwe‚Äôre drowning in mediocrity,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúAnd so what I do‚Äìit‚Äôs a horrible thing‚Äìbut I‚Äôve started watching my own movies, and actually they‚Äôre pretty good! And also, they don‚Äôt age.‚Äù</p>

 <p>He continued, ‚ÄúI watched&nbsp;<em>Black Hawk</em>&nbsp;[<em>Down</em>] the other night and I thought, ‚ÄòHow in the hell did I manage to do that?‚Äô But I think occasionally a good one will happen, [and] it‚Äôs like a relief that there‚Äôs somebody out there who‚Äôs doing a good movie.‚Äù</p> <p>It‚Äôs unclear if he went on to mention what those ‚Äúgood ones‚Äù are. It would be hard to top 2023‚Äôs <em>Napoleon</em>, after all. Scott‚Äôs next movie is a post-apocalyptic sci-fi thriller called <em>The Dog Stars</em>. It‚Äôs out March 2026.</p>

              <p>Any creator that wants to be taken seriously needs to start focusing a lot more on their audio. It doesn‚Äôt matter if your doing simple vlogs from your couch or conducting those man-on-the-street styled videos. Your viewers, whether they are conscious of it are not, are going to notice your sound quality. Cheap audio reduces the production value of your work, even more so than poorly shot or low quality video does, at least in my opinion. The good news is that it‚Äôs easy to take your audio up from sounding bad to sound pretty good. The DJI Mic Mini is a wireless lavalier microphone that is easy to use and far from expensive.<a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4534/"> It normally goes for $60, but right now, Amazon has it listed for 29% off. That saves you $17, bringing the price down to just $42 for a limited time.</a></p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4534/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Comfortable on You and in Frame</h2>
<p>The DJI Mic Mini is an ultra-light miniature wireless transmitter that can be worn comfortably and is aesthetically pleasing on camera.</p>
<p>This mini microphone for creators can be placed on the speaker‚Äôs person in three different convenient ways. It can clip onto the collar of their shirt as well as the inside of a button-up. You can choose to magnetically adhere it. Just slap the mini clip magnet behind the shirt with the DJI Mic on the front. And then lastly, you can use a simple lanyard and have it hang around the speakers neck like a necklace.</p>
<p>All you need is the one transmitter. When fully charged, it has a maximum operating time of up to eight hours. That should give you plenty of time to record interviews, selfie videos, on-stage events, or whatever it is your looking to capture.</p>



<p>The mic utilizes intelligent noise cancelling at two separate levels. The basic mode is made for indoor settings that are relatively quiet but still has some background noise that‚Äôs better off removed. Strong mode is ideal of outdoor noisy environments where you really need to separate the sound of your person speaking from the crowds.</p>
<p>The DJI Mic Mini uses an algorithm to makes sure the audio it picks up is good to use. It‚Äôs automatic limiting feature will lower the volume on its own if it detect audio input is too high. This can help prevent clipping.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4534/">For a limited time, you can grab the DJI Mic Mini wireless lavalier for the reduced price of just $42. Save $17 and upgrade your audio recording today.</a></p>

              <p>OpenAI launched its new generative AI video tool, called Sora 2, last week, alongside a TikTok-like social media platform where invite-only users could share <a href="https://kotaku.com/openai-sora-2-videos-pokemon-spongebob-dragon-ball-2000631137">all of their favorite copyright-infringing nightmare fuel</a>. There was Mario racing from the cops and Goku fighting the hero from <em>One-Punch Man</em>. But the 9-second clip I can‚Äôt get out of my head is an AI-generated <a href="https://x.com/SHL0MS/status/1973959800754217190">Sam Altman barbequing Pikachu</a> before munching on a slice of the beloved Pok√©mon mascot like it‚Äôs seared tuna.</p> <p>Nintendo and other companies have yet to comment on OpenAI‚Äôs latest legal minefield, but Altman is already backpedaling on Sora 2‚Äôs initial free-wheeling, anything-goes, copyright-holders-be-damned spirit. The company recently announced a change to how the tool is structured so that companies have to ‚Äúopt in‚Äù for users to get Sora 2 to generate videos using that company‚Äôs IP, where previously they had to ‚Äúopt out‚Äù for it <em>not </em>to do so. OpenAI will also be setting up some sort of payment system to give companies a fraction of the revenue generated from their IP-adjacent slop.</p>

We assume different people will try very different approaches and will figure out what works for them. But we want to apply the same standard towards everyone, and let rightsholders decide how to proceed (our aim of course is to make it so compelling that many people want to). There may be some edge cases of generations that get through that shouldn‚Äôt, and getting our stack to work well will take some iteration.</p></blockquote> <p>He also specified that Sora 2 users were producing a disproportionate amount of meme clips using anime and video game characters. ‚ÄúIn particular, we‚Äôd like to acknowledge the remarkable creative output of Japan‚Äîwe are struck by how deep the connection between users and Japanese content is!‚Äù</p>

Disney, Warner Bros. and other major media companies are already suing competitor Midjourney over the ease with which its users can generate rip-offs of <em>Star Wars</em>, <em>The Avengers</em>, and<em> Batman</em>. Meanwhile, publishers like<em> IGN </em>owner Ziff Davis and <em>The New York Times</em> are suing OpenAI <a href="https://www.npr.org/2025/01/14/nx-s1-5258952/new-york-times-openai-microsoft">over unauthorized copying</a> of their online archives to train its algorithms.</p>

 <h2>What is Nintendo saying about generative AI?</h2> <p>So far, however, most video game companies have have yet to cut deals with OpenAI or accuse it of theft. The notoriously litigious Nintendo recently called a report from a Japanese politician stating that it was lobbying for AI protections untrue. ‚ÄúContrary to recent discussions on the internet, Nintendo has not had any contact with the Japanese government about generative AI,‚Äù the Switch 2 maker <a href="https://x.com/NintendoCoLtd/status/1974716195246088220">announced over the weekend</a>. ‚ÄúWhether generative AI is involved or not, we will continue to take necessary actions against infringement of our intellectual property rights.‚Äù</p>

 <p>While companies have stayed silent about how they‚Äôre dealing with potential infringement concerns, most are happy to advertise their ambitions to use new generative AI tools to try and streamline production. <a href="https://automaton-media.com/en/news/over-50-of-japanese-game-companies-use-ai-in-development-according-to-tokyo-game-show-organizer/">According to a recent survey</a>, roughly half of Japanese game studios are already using some form of AI in game development. Microsoft, an early backer of OpenAI, is one of the technology‚Äôs loudest proponents, though the results so far have been meager at best. When it comes to gaming in particular, the tech giant has rolled out <a href="https://kotaku.com/xbox-ai-copilot-minecraft-overwatch-insider-microsoft-1851769746">AI chatbots</a> for game help, and is experimenting with quick prototyping of gameplay.</p> <p>‚ÄúYou could imagine a world where, from gameplay data and video, that a model could learn old games and really make them portable to any platform where these models could run,‚Äù&nbsp; Microsoft Gaming CEO Phil Spencer <a href="https://aftermath.site/microsoft-xbox-muse-ai-phil-spencer-dipshit">said earlier this year</a>. Who knows if that will ever actually happen? For now we have fake footage of <a href="https://x.com/fofrAI/status/1973152115259482575">Master Chief in <em>Mario Kart 8</em></a> instead.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>This summer, Nintendo raised the prices of it‚Äôs previous generation Nintendo Switch consoles following President Donald Trump‚Äôs announcement to impose new tariffs on a range of countries. The base model Nintendo Switch, which originally launched at $300, is now sold for $340 new. You can, however, find the Nintendo Switch for much less than even the starting price. Buying refurbished hardware is a great way to save some money while refreshing what you play or work with. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4528/">Amazon has a renewed Nintendo Switch on sale for $227</a>. That‚Äôs 24% less than the original value it sold for from 2017 to the beginning half of this year and 33% less than it‚Äôs new selling price for 2025.</p>
<p>It may seem like a weird time to dip into this eight year old gaming console. This summer, the next generation of Nintendo consoles launched with the Switch 2 after all. However, if you missed out on this chapter from the Japanese game and hardware developer, there is a treasure trove of amazing games just waiting for you to experience.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4528/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Massive Library of Hit After Hit</h2>
<p><em>Animal Crossing: New Horizons</em> is a wonderful little life sim that many Nintendo fans and even folks who wouldn‚Äôt normally describe themselves as gamers found solace in during the 2020 lockdown. <em>The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild</em> and its sequel <em>The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom</em>&nbsp;can provide hundreds of hours of discovery, adventure, a problem-solving for any eager player looking to get lost in a beautiful open world.</p>
<p>Beyond just the first party stuff, the Nintendo Switch has countless indie titles for you to sink your teeth into. Games like <em>Celeste</em> and&nbsp;<em>Sea of Stars</em> are routed in the side-scrolling platformers and JRPGs of the Super Nintendo era. The Switch is still receiving new titles as well. Two of the best indie games in the console‚Äôs history are Supergiant Games‚Äô&nbsp;action roguelike&nbsp;<em>Hades</em> along with Team Cherry‚Äôs grueling Metroidvania&nbsp;<em>Hollow Knight</em>. Both titles received sequels this past month ‚Äî&nbsp;<em>Hades II </em>and <em>Hollow Knight: Silksong </em>‚Äî&nbsp;which are available for the original Nintendo Switch.</p>



<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4528/">As a renewed gaming console, the Nintendo Switch you receive after ordering is confirmed to have been professionally inspected, tested, and cleaned by Amazon-qualified suppliers</a>. Your console is guaranteed to have no visible cosmetic imperfections when held at arm‚Äôs length and is even eligible for replacement or refund within the first 90 days of receipt if you aren‚Äôt satisfied with the purchase.</p>

              <p>As reported by&nbsp;<a href="https://mynintendonews.com/2025/10/05/nintendo-is-requesting-4500000-in-damages-from-a-switch-piracy-reddit-mod/"><em>My Nintendo News</em></a>, Nintendo is continuing to pursue its <a href="https://kotaku.com/nintendo-switch-reddit-switchpirates-court-filing-1851710042">attempts to take down members of a Switch piracy Reddit</a>, and more specifically the sub‚Äôs moderator, James Williams, known as Archbox. As with most of Nintendo‚Äôs court targets, he was seemingly given an opportunity to walk away and chose not to take it. As <em>Kotaku</em> mentioned in July 2024, <a href="https://kotaku.com/nintendo-switch-piracy-hacked-roms-emulator-1851572451">Nintendo had sent Archbox cease-and-desist letters which the company alleges he chose to ignore</a>. As a result of that, court filings were made and it seems Archbox ignored those too. Now the company is demanding $4,500,000 in a default ruling.</p> <p>Nintendo‚Äôs ongoing pursuit of all involved in potential piracy of their consoles and games would be proving quite the revenue stream for the company, if it ever demanded the millions of dollars from people who could actually pay. After <a href="https://kotaku.com/nintendo-lawsuit-modding-switch-2-ryan-daly-2000623984">successfully suing Modded Hardware‚Äôs Ryan Daly last month for $2 million</a> that he‚Äôll never be able to give them, bringing about <a href="https://kotaku.com/bowser-agrees-to-pay-nintendo-10-million-in-hacking-la-1848172917">the eternal ruination of Gary Bowser in 2021</a> who will owe Nintendo $10 million for the rest of his life, and the company‚Äôs <a href="https://kotaku.com/nintendo-switch-piracy-lawsuit-mario-luigi-zelda-echoes-1851693898">attempts to get $7.5 million from Jess Keighin</a> last year, the Japanese behemoth is now going after Reddit moderator James ‚ÄúArchbox‚Äù Williams and asking for $4.5 million he won‚Äôt have. The idea, presumably, is to send shockwaves through piracy communities, given almost everyone who is targeted wouldn‚Äôt be able to pay for even Nintendo‚Äôs legal fees, let alone any money awarded.</p>

 <p>Meanwhile, sticking your fingers in your ears and hoping it will go away rarely proves to be an effective legal response, especially if you‚Äôve no anonymity and evidence very convincingly suggests you committed the crimes. As OatmealDome stated on BlueSky, Nintendo is coming after James Williams for $4,500,000 in damages by ‚Äúdefault judgment.‚Äù</p>   <h2>The Lost Cause</h2> <p>(Just for the sake of my colleagues, let me state right here that this article is&nbsp;<em>my</em> opinion, and not necessarily that of others at <em>Kotaku</em>. God knows, we disagree on a lot.)</p>

 <p>As is always the case in all of these proceedings, aside from the simple fact that illegally downloading something is‚Ä¶illegal, the idea that piracy costs a company significant losses is always stated as fact but is never asked to be proven or evidenced. Courts frequently take it on face value that any downloaded ROM must automatically represent a lost sale; something that‚Äôs never been demonstrated and <a href="https://draginol.joeuser.com/article/303512/Piracy_PC_Gaming">is clearly very spurious</a>, no matter how widely believed it may be. Ever since the days of Napster, corporations have been using ‚Äúone download = one lost sale‚Äù to work out their claimed losses, which led to the gruesome spate of rulings in the early 2000s in which individuals were being bankrupted with ludicrous damages because their kids (who obviously wouldn‚Äôt have been able to afford to buy the music if they‚Äôd not pirated it, thus representing no lost sales at all) downloaded a bunch of mp3s. Nintendo continues with the same thinking <a href="https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.wawd.336727/gov.uscourts.wawd.336727.25.0.pdf">in its latest court filing</a>, stating,</p>

 <blockquote><p>‚ÄúNOA has suffered damages as a result of these breaches, including but not limited to decreased profits and a loss of profits related to reproduction and distribution of the Nintendo Switch games and related to users whose accounts NOA has terminated for violation of the EULA.‚Äù</p></blockquote> <p>(I really do love the argument that Nintendo is suffering losses because it terminates people‚Äôs accounts.) It also goes on to claim that these losses are directly affecting employed individuals.</p> <blockquote><p>‚ÄúThese activities have substantially damaged NOA‚Äôs overall business and intellectual property rights, as well as the business and intellectual property rights of NOA‚Äôs development and publishing partners, and further has caused harm to the many artists, game designers, programmers and others whose livelihoods depend upon the sale of authorized Nintendo products.‚Äù</p></blockquote> <p>I find it quite extraordinary to declare that there has been harm to the livelihoods of specific employees without providing any evidence at all, instead relying on people‚Äôs feeling that piracy surely must cost a company money. It really behooves Nintendo to demonstrate any example of one of its own employed artists, designers, or programmers as having had their livelihoods affected, but it doesn‚Äôt attempt to and certainly never will. Claims like this are commonplace and pernicious, and I believe it‚Äôs crucial to at the very least ask for proof when they‚Äôre made. (It‚Äôs especially unpleasant at a time when we‚Äôre seeing companies reporting massive profits while sacking thousands of staff, making a mockery of the entire concept.)</p>

 <p>And please let me make clear: if you‚Äôre shouting at your screen, ‚Äú<em>Of course game piracy causes significant losses and harms!</em>‚Äù all I am asking for is your evidence. Please demonstrate it, so I can agree with you. Of course it costs them <em>some</em> sales, it‚Äôs certainly not nothing, but nothing close to the ruinous amounts being claimed.</p>

 <h2>Expensive Speech</h2> <p>The case is unusual in that Williams is not only being sued for his making some manner of profit from allegedly charging for ‚Äúpro‚Äù services, but primarily for ‚Äúpromoting‚Äù the piracy, directing Reddit users to his pages where Nintendo ROMs can be downloaded. This area of <em>encouraging</em> piracy is far more tricky in court, although historically that hasn‚Äôt been something judges have been particularly troubled by. The Nintendo filing repeatedly refers to <a href="https://www.billboard.com/music/music-news/case-summary-mgm-studios-vs-grokster-1410184/">2007‚Äôs Supreme Court ruling in the MGM versus Grokster case</a>, although that left a lot of ambiguity, and became overly focused on the technology rather than the principle. However, exploiting these issues would require Williams to be able to both afford a legal defense that could stand up to that of Nintendo‚Äôs, and‚Äîwell‚Äîfor him to acknowledge the situation at all.</p>

 <p>Nintendo usually reserves its ire for those who are actively profiting from piracy, charging for services or access to ROMs through so-called ‚ÄúPirate Shops,‚Äù at which point the criminality is far more clear. That‚Äôs really not so much the case in this latest situation where the filing instead breaks down how Williams has promoted free Pirate Shops and given people information on how to circumvent the Switch‚Äôs anti-piracy measures. It does go on to allege that Archbox created ‚Äúpro‚Äù versions of these offerings, exchanging access for ‚Äúdonations‚Äù of eShop cards, which far more immediately suggests tangible criminality, but this isn‚Äôt the emphasis.</p> <p>The filing, however, does lay out some extensive detective work, explaining why Nintendo believes Archbox has been involved at every stage of the piracy process, from being a member of the ROM dumping team to distributing circumvention software, then the creation of the distribution sites all the way to providing instructions for how to use them on Reddit and Discord. Again, Nintendo‚Äôs lawyers lay out how the ‚Äúdonation‚Äù schemes applied throughout, which potentially means the court won‚Äôt have to consider all the other claims and how they relate to free speech, or will more likely just handwave them through, given there‚Äôs evidence of profit.</p> <p>This is all made more damning for Archbox given his own responses, or lack thereof. Nintendo‚Äôs filing claims he initially ‚Äúacknowledged his conduct violated NOA‚Äôs rights and stated he would work with NOA to satisfy its demands,‚Äù but that he denied involvement with the ‚ÄúShops,‚Äù and then when Nintendo requested confirmation in writing that he‚Äôd comply with its demands, ‚Äúhe became combative and uncooperative.‚Äù Archbox rather pointlessly deleted his GitHub and took a few of the sites offline, but Nintendo says he left LiberaShop running throughout. Nintendo says that on May 17, 2024, it gave him ‚Äúa final opportunity to comply with its demands prior to litigation,‚Äù and Williams responded saying an attorney would contact them. This never happened, and later, after some rather limited communication with a lawyer stating he represented Williams in early 2025, this, too, fell apart.</p>

 <h2>Damaging Figures</h2> <p>The rest of the filing goes on to argue for a default ruling, lists all of its allegations against Williams while making many more spurious claims about lost sales, then cites copyright and EULA violations, before finally reaching its rather loose justification for the $4.5 million figure: because someone did the same for Bungie. The figure itself just appears to have been plucked from the air, given the document states,</p> <blockquote><p>‚ÄúHere, the amount of money sufficient to remedy NOA‚Äôs injury would be extremely difficult to quantify; but it is indisputable that such amount would be large. Therefore, the money at stake by this Motion is nowhere near an amount that would compensate NOA for the seriousness of Defendants‚Äô conduct.‚Äù</p></blockquote> <p>For all the back-and-forth, there‚Äôs obviously no doubt that distributing ROMs and circumventing piracy measures is viewed as criminal. While there are unquestionably arguments to be made about the nature of the related rulings, it would require massive financial backing to successfully argue any of this in courts, and not within the purview of Nintendo‚Äôs targets. Meanwhile, it‚Äôs essential to take on board that Nintendo does appear to give these people the chance to agree to cease and desist, although the exact terms are unclear, and only resorts to litigation after that‚Äôs refused.</p>

 <h2>No Mercy</h2> <p>For me, the larger issue is the nature of the punishments, which seem to defy any notion of mercy. From my scant understanding of the situation, James ‚ÄúArchbox‚Äù Williams seems like a fool, an allegedly leading figure in an action known to be against the law who was given a chance to get out of this situation and refused to take it. However, no matter the individual, a way to make amends is an essential part of a judicial system. Criminals are supposed to be able to ‚Äúpay their debt to society,‚Äù and rehabilitation should be central to consequences. Financial debt of the magnitude Nintendo demands from individuals is obviously impossible to ever pay back, and means a permanent, life-long punishment for a crime that‚Äîgiven the nature of offenses for which people are routinely sentenced to years in prison, or the meaningless financial penalties given to vast corporations for their deadly negligence‚Äîis relatively minor.</p> <p>Famously, <a href="https://kotaku.com/nintendo-gary-bowser-hacking-case-legal-jail-xecuter-1850346297">Gary Bowser will have to give between 25 and 30 percent of his income to Nintendo for the rest of his life</a>, and given that his time spent in prison makes it far harder for him to get well-compensated employment, this will likely leave him in dire straits until he dies. There‚Äôs no opportunity for reform here, no way to ‚Äúpay his debt‚Äù either literally or metaphorically, and the same is true for every other individual pursued in this way.</p> <p>But so long as courts allow ‚Äúone download = one lost sale‚Äù to continue to be accepted without asking for any evidence at all, and let through claims that employees‚Äô livelihoods are harmed without demanding a single example, Nintendo will continue to chase such outrageous financial penalties in its furious (and ultimately futile) pursuits. ‚ÄúIf you can‚Äôt do the time, don‚Äôt do the crime‚Äù might be a popular (if ignorant) refrain, but when the crime is copying video games, and the time is eternity, perhaps something is dreadfully amiss.</p>
