              <p>The Pokémon Company has issued an apology after a listing appeared on its official site for a&nbsp;<em>Pokémon TCG</em> event said to be taking place at the Yasukuni Shrine. This controversial site has repeatedly caused consternation in Japan when visited by political figures, and even by previous Pokémon employees, and once again people were upset to see the location listed as the site of a TCG tournament.</p> <p>The Yasukuni Shrine commemorates the Japanese people who died in conflicts from 1869 to 1954, and thus includes the soldiers who died as part of Japan’s forces fighting for the Axis powers in World War II, many of whom were charged with the most serious of war crimes. As such, it’s a very controversial site, both within and without the country, and it causes serious stirs whenever anyone of prominence chooses to make a public visit. Indeed, The Pokémon Company discovered this for itself in 2019 when a number of employees from Creatures visited the Shinto shrine for its <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hatsum%C5%8Dde"><i>hatsumōde</i></a>.</p>

 <p>Given its hugely complicated politics and the controversies that arise every time it’s visited, TPC clearly doesn’t want it used as the site of a <em>PTCG</em> event. However, live events are added to the company’s site by those with an official <em>Pokémon&nbsp;</em>Play certification, rather than by TPC itself. It works the same all around the world—if you want to find a local Play event near you, <a href="https://events.pokemon.com/EventLocator/?locale=en-us">you can look them up on the U.S. version of the site</a>. So it seems someone with such a certification in Japan added the event to the vast numbers listed for the country.</p> <p>“On the event search page of the ‘Pokémon Card Game Trainers Website’ operated by our company,” <a href="https://corporate.pokemon.co.jp/media/news/detail/368.html">begins a statement on&nbsp;<em>Pokémon</em>‘s corporate site</a> (via machine translation), “information about an event scheduled to be held at Yasukuni Shrine was posted.” The statement goes on to call allowing this Yasukuni Shrine event to be listed the result of a “lack of due diligence,” adding, “even though it should not have been held in the first place.”</p>

 <p>The event was canceled once discovered, say TPC, adding an apology (again, via machine translation). “We have received feedback and opinions from various parties since the information about this event was released, and we sincerely apologize for this.” The company adds that it will “fundamentally change and strengthen the review system and confirmation process for event information” to prevent something like this happening again.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[New Nintendo Direct Rumors Point To An Incoming Flood Of Switch 2 Ports]]></title>
            <link>https://kotaku.com/february-nintendo-direct-switch-2-3d-mario-2000664537</link>
            <guid>1420885</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>The usual suspects are buzzing about an upcoming Nintendo Direct to kick off February. This one will reportedly be a Partner Showcase, so while I wouldn’t expect teases for anything wild like a new <em>3D Mario</em> game, we’ll probably got a healthy influx of new <a href="https://kotaku.com/switch-2-ports-cyberpunk-2077-ps4-ps5-xbox-dlss-outlaws-1851782817">Switch 2 ports</a> to help button down the first half of the platform’s year.</p> <p>Nintendo traditionally holds a February showcase to preview what’s coming and help fill in release calendar slots for its loyal fans. Podcasting insider <a href="https://x.com/NateTheHate2/status/2016962284921249815">NateTheHate</a> and YouTube channel <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QKp9okfMtdI">GameXplain</a> have both suggested 2026 will follow a similar pattern, though the event will be a Partner Showcase rather than a full-blown first-party Direct. <em><a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/a-nintendo-direct-is-reportedly-coming-next-week-dedicated-to-partner-games/">VGC</a></em> was also able to corroborate those claims. So expect a new Nintendo Direct somewhere around February 3-5.</p>

 <p>But what is Nintendo likely to show? Well, we’re still waiting on firm release dates for <em>Elden Ring</em> and <em>Borderlands 4</em> on Switch 2. The latter was recently rumored to be coming near the end of February. There’s also been plenty of smoke about <em>Monster Hunter Wilds</em> making it over to Nintendo’s latest console, as well as the port for <em>Final Fantasy VII Rebirth</em> coming sooner than expected. <em>Metaphor: Refantazio</em>, <em>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</em>, and <em>Final Fantasy XVI</em> also seem like potential candidates.</p> <p>I’m more curious to see where this missing Microsoft support for the Switch 2 is. Some version of <em>Call of Duty</em> is rumored to be coming to the platform this spring and the company still hasn’t confirmed a <em>Halo: Combat Evolved</em> remake port for the Switch 2. There’s also plenty of lower-hanging fruit like<em> Sea of Thieves</em>, <em>Diablo 4</em>, and <em>Avowed</em>, which is coming to PS5 next month. <em>Starfield</em> would also be a big get. Is a Switch 2 port part of the game’s rumored 2.0 plans? Hopefully.</p>

 <p>Announcements for new games would also be nice. We know we’re getting FromSoftware’s <a href="https://kotaku.com/the-duskbloods-elden-ring-hidetaka-miyazaki-switch-2-1851774753">multiplayer action game <em>Duskbloods</em></a> sometime this year. It’ll be interesting to see if any other major studios reveal exclusive side-projects for the Nintendo platform. But in the new era of every game being playable on every device, that seems less likely than a slew of new AAA ports.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Calling the Samsung Odyssey OLED G9 “ultra-wide” barely scratches the surface. This thing is enormous. At 49 inches across, it can dominate an entire desk. It’s the kind of monitor that makes dual-screen setups look quaint, delivering a single, seamless canvas that stretches far into your peripheral vision. Right now, it’s also far more affordable than usual. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3899/">The Odyssey OLED G9 normally sells for $1,249, but Amazon has dropped the price to $900, knocking a hefty $349 off the total for a limited time.</a></p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3899/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Lose Yourself in Super Wide Worlds</h2>
<p>That massive panel isn’t just about size for the sake of spectacle. The display runs at a resolution of 5120 by 1440, effectively matching two 27-inch QHD monitors fused together. Games and apps have room to breathe, and multitasking feels natural instead of cramped. The 1800R curve gently wraps around your field of view, making long gaming sessions feel immersive rather than overwhelming. It mirrors the way our eyes naturally take in our surroundings, pulling you deeper into sprawling open worlds or competitive arenas.</p>
<p>Speed is another major highlight. With a 240Hz refresh rate, the Odyssey OLED G9 is built for fluid motion and fast reactions. Paired with an ultra-low 0.03ms response time, on-screen action stays immediate and razor sharp even during frantic firefights or high-speed racing. NVIDIA G-Sync and AMD FreeSync Premium Pro support keep frames smooth and synchronized with your GPU, minimizing screen tearing and stutter so gameplay stays consistent and responsive.</p>



<p>The OLED panel itself elevates everything you put on screen. Blacks are truly black, whites are strikingly bright, and colors have a depth that standard LCDs struggle to match. Contrast is intense and precise, with light and dark areas kept tightly controlled. There’s no distracting glow or bleed around bright objects, which helps scenes look cleaner and more realistic. Games, movies, and even everyday desktop use benefit from the added clarity and vibrancy.</p>
<p>Connectivity is refreshingly flexible. The monitor includes HDMI 2.1, DisplayPort, and a built-in USB hub, making it easy to juggle multiple devices. You can keep a gaming PC, work laptop, and another device connected at the same time and switch between them effortlessly. The Odyssey OLED G9 can even detect active sources and automatically jump to the right input. For power users, picture-in-picture and split-screen options allow two different systems to share the display side by side.</p>
<p>Deals like this don’t come around often for flagship OLED gaming monitors. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3899/">Dropping from $1,249 to $900, the Samsung Odyssey OLED G9 becomes far more compelling for anyone ready to go all-in on a truly immersive setup.</a> For players who want size, speed, and image quality in one unapologetically massive package, this is a rare chance to save big.</p>

              <p>Powering your Switch doesn’t have to be complicated. While you technically can power your console with any third-party USB charger or a power bank, you’ll get the best performance with only a few. The 45W Nintendo charger by Marsdock is one of the most reliable options around.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6960/">It typically sits at an already affordable price of $17, but you can now grab it for only $14 at Amazon – thanks to a 15% discount.</a> This offer applies to the option that includes a 5-foot cable. If you’re looking for something that’s a bit longer, the 10-foot is available for $17, down from $19. Grabbing two of these will knock another 6% off your total. Prime members can enjoy free delivery with their purchase, which brings the overall cost down even further.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6960/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Speedy and Reliable</h2>
<p>For under $15, you’ll enjoy high-speed charging. It gets your consoles from 0 to 50% in just an hour, offering significantly greater charging stability and higher efficiency than the standard 39W options. The adapter supports input from 100-240V and output up to 15V/2.6A, which makes it great for everyday gaming and travel. Compatibility is just as impressive, as the charger plays nicely with most devices that can be charged under 45W via USB-C. These include Switch, Switch OLED, Switch Lite, Switch TV dock, Steam Deck, and Switch Pro Controller.</p>



<p>Marsdock takes durability seriously with this one, too. The premium cord is rated for over 2000 bends, which ensures longevity, while the solid, well-fitting plug maintains safety and offers efficient power transfer. Additionally, there are built-in multi-safeguards and a cooling system that intelligently monitors temperature, offering protection against overcharging, short circuiting, overheating, and sparking. Basically, you can use the charger anywhere, anytime, without worry.</p>
<p>Included in the box are the 45W AC power adapter, with a 5ft AC extension cord. On a regular day, you’d pay around $17 to enjoy the convenience and fast speeds this charger offers, which is already quite affordable. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6960/">The current 15% discount, however, drops it to just $14.</a> Amazon has listed the discount as a limited-time offer, so it’s best to grab it without wasting much time. Now is also a great time to stock up on other gaming accessories and essentials, as we’re spotting quite a lot going for less at the retailer. We’re covering the best offers that are worth your hard-earned money, so be sure to check back for the latest drops!</p>

              <p>The Nintendo Switch Game Voucher is <a href="https://kotaku.com/nintendo-switch-voucher-mario-kart-fire-emblem-discount-1850062170">one of those straight-up good deals</a>. If you’re a subscriber to Nintendo Switch Online, you can buy two coupons for $100, which can then be used to buy two full-price digital games more usually priced at $60 each. Boom, $20 saved, two new games to enjoy. And today, January 30, 2026, marks the very last day you can buy the vouchers. Boo.</p> <p>Back in July of last year, <a href="https://kotaku.com/switch-2-vouchers-pokemon-za-metroid-prime-4-preorder-1851785969">Nintendo announced its intention to kill off the voucher scheme</a> alongside the launch of the Switch 2. With newer game prices nudging up to $70 and $80, it was made immediately clear the vouchers would not be valid for Switch 2 games, but that it <em>would</em> still be possible to take advantage of the scheme for another six months, and that all vouchers bought would remain valid for a full year after the point of purchase. Well, that day has come, and if you want to be sure of a way to pick up a couple of full-price Switch games between now and 2027, this is your last chance. A huge thanks to <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2026/01/reminder-todays-your-last-day-to-buy-switch-game-vouchers"><em>Nintendo Life</em></a> for reminding us of the deadline.</p>

 <p>It’s still a great offer! Nintendo very notably still hasn’t moved on to focusing its new titles on the Switch 2, and the vouchers will save you a chunk off the just-released <em>Metroid Prime 4</em>, and indeed on April 16’s&nbsp;<em>Tomodachi Life: Living the</em> Dream<a href="https://kotaku.com/tomodachi-life-living-the-dream-direct-nintendo-2000664120">,</a> <a href="https://kotaku.com/tomodachi-life-living-the-dream-direct-nintendo-2000664120">which we learned new details about yesterday</a>. The vouchers are also valid on a really decent range of games including <em>Pokémon Legends: Z-A</em>,&nbsp;<em>Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom</em>,&nbsp;<em>Mario &amp; Luigi: Brothership</em>, and even the $70&nbsp;<em>Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom</em>. These are all first-party Nintendo titles which are&nbsp;very rarely put on sale.&nbsp;You can see the <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/store/games/game-voucher-eligible/#sort=df&amp;p=0">lengthy full list of eligible titles here</a>.</p> <p>It’s a double-bummer that this isn’t being extended to the Switch 2, given Nintendo also killed off its <a href="https://kotaku.com/nintendos-rewards-program-is-actually-pretty-good-1823654369">splendid gold coins</a>. These were accrued by buying new games, and every dollar spent got you 5c worth of coins. At its best, this meant spending the $100 needed to get two vouchers also got you another $5 off a purchase. Quite why Nintendo’s removed all these advantages and offered no new incentives on Switch 2 is unknown, and a massive disappointment.</p>

 <p>However, if you <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/store/products/nintendo-switch-game-vouchers/">buy a pair of vouchers today</a>, they will remain valid until Jan 30, 2027. That <em>Tomodachi Life</em> was added to the scheme so close to its demise is a sign that&nbsp;maybeNintendo might even put other new Switch 1 releases into the offer even after it can no longer be purchased. No guarantees, though.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/airpods-4-with-anc-carry-the-biggest-discount-in-apples-earbuds-lineup-now-at-an-all-time-low-2000664296</link>
            <guid>1420765</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Apple AirPods 4 are wireless earbuds with Active Noise Cancellation in a compact form that is convenient to carry and use throughout the day. To enhance comfort and stability, Apple redesigned the AirPods 4 earbuds with a more defined shape and a shorter stem with easy-to-use press controls for playing music and answering calls. For a quieter experience, the Active Noise Cancellation feature helps reduce external sounds as they reach your ears. If you prefer to stay aware of your surroundings, Transparency Mode lets you listen to what is happening around you while continuing to listen to your music.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6034/">You can purchase the Apple AirPods 4 at Amazon for $119. This is a savings of $60 and 34% off of their original price of $179.</a></p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6034/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Some of Apple’s best earbuds for calls, music, podcasts, and more</h2>
<p>AirPods 4 have an optical in-ear sensor that ensures they play audio only when the earbuds are worn and pause when they are removed. They feature a vent system designed for pressure-balanced sound, which can make extended listening feel much more comfortable. Plus, there are physical controls that let you perform common actions, such as controlling music playback and managing calls, without having to access your phone.</p>
<p>With Active Noise Cancellation, the Adaptive Audio feature combines noise cancellation with Transparency Mode to adapt to your surroundings. Conversation Awareness can automatically lower the volume of what you are listening to when you begin talking with someone nearby, and then raise it back up after you stop speaking. Voice Isolation uses computational audio to minimize ambient noise and improve clarity in noisy environments.</p>



<p>For music, TV programs, movies, and video games, Personalized Spatial Audio features dynamic head tracking to place sound around you. The high-excursion driver, high-dynamic-range amplifier, and Adaptive EQ work together to deliver a consistent, balanced sound that adapts to how well each AirPod fits your ears. The H2 headphone chip supports the processing required for spatial effects and noise reduction.</p>
<p>The USB-C charging case provides additional battery life, extending how long you can listen. With Active Noise Cancellation, you can expect up to 4 hours of listening time and up to 20 hours with the charging case. Five minutes of charging can provide approximately one hour of listening time.</p>
<p>Hands-free Siri can be activated with either “Siri” or “Hey Siri.” Also, with Siri Interactions, you can respond with a nod yes or a gentle shake no. Audio Sharing lets you share audio with two AirPods. Find My lets you locate your AirPods 4 and the charging case<a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6034/">. The AirPods 4 and the charging case are both rated IP54 for dust, sweat, and water resistance. Now’s a great time to buy the AirPods 4, as they’re currently $119, down from $179.</a></p>
