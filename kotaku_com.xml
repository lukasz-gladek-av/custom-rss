              <p>The first two<a href="https://kotaku.com/capcom-survey-dino-crisis-sequel-remake-onimusha-okami-1851235768"><em> Dino Crisis</em></a> games, originally released on the PlayStation 1 back over 25 years ago, have finally made their way over to Steam. That’s cool, but uh, wait a minute here, did Capcom include performance-killing DRM on these retro releases? Yes. Yes, it did.</p> <p>On February 12, Capcom announced a fun little surprise for <em><a href="https://kotaku.com/capcom-new-dino-crisis-merch-event-sequel-remake-horror-2000616659">Dino Crisis</a> f</em>ans. No, it wasn’t a new game or a remake or even a fancy remaster. Instead, Capcom revealed that 1999’s <em>Dino Crisis</em> and its 2000 sequel, <em>Dino Crisis 2,</em> were now available to buy on Valve’s large digital PC gaming store, Steam. As mentioned already, that’s cool. I mean, the games have been available on GOG for a bit and can be easily emulated on fairly weak PCs, but it’s always nice to see publishers bringing older games to more platforms and stores. Except, fans quickly spotted something silly:<em> Dino Crisis 1 </em>and <em>2</em> on Steam include Engima Protector DRM.</p>

 <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">Playtime is officially over, kiddies!</p> <p>Dino Crisis and Dino Crisis 2 have finally stomped their way on to Steam. Celebrate this prehistoric occasion by getting both games for 50% off until February 26.</p> <p>🦖 <a href="https://t.co/9uBEJb3tsB">https://t.co/9uBEJb3tsB</a><br>🦖🦖 <a href="https://t.co/dEmqfq19y2">https://t.co/dEmqfq19y2</a> <a href="https://t.co/gWsWh8W1T3">pic.twitter.com/gWsWh8W1T3</a></p> <p>— Capcom USA (@CapcomUSA_) <a href="https://twitter.com/CapcomUSA_/status/2022113977564590098?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">February 13, 2026</a></p></blockquote>  <p><em>Kotaku</em> has contacted Capcom, but didn’t hear back before publication.</p> <p>Over on the <em>Dino Crisis</em> Steam forums, you can see plenty of people yelling at Capcom about this incredibly silly and frankly stupid decision. “DRM on a 27-year-old game? Really? What’s wrong with these guys?” <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/app/4249130/discussions/0/796709978759016171/">asked one user.</a> Others pointed out that this is the same DRM that Capcom <a href="https://kotaku.com/resident-evil-4-remake-pc-drm-denuvo-steam-review-2000668182">recently added to its years-old <em>Resident Evil 4 </em>remake.</a> And that was a disaster, causing all sorts of performance problems for many users on PC.</p> <p>This is made all the more strange by the fact that these<a href="https://kotaku.com/dino-crisis-1-2-pc-gog-drm-freelancer-ff7-1851750391"><em> Dino Crisis</em> PC ports seem to be the same versions being sold currently on GOG</a> with zero DRM. For whatever reason, Capcom has decided that the same games available DRM-free on GOG should include crappy DRM that people hate if you buy them on Steam. As you can expect, a lot of people are opting to buy<em> Dino Crisis</em> on GOG until Capcom removes the DRM.</p>

              <p><i><span>Starsand Island</span></i><span>, a cozy farming sim from developer and publisher Seed Sparkle Lab, released in Early Access on February 11 and things are already off to a rough start. Kickstarter backers have reported not receiving their release codes, the Xbox Series version is reportedly a mess, its $20 cosmetic DLC ticked off its crowdfunding backers, and the “</span><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/starsand-island-devs-remove-unreasonable-clauses-from-the-games-eula-promise-more-features-and-fixes-in-coming-updates"><span>virtual goods</span></a><span>” clause in its EULA has raised some eyebrows.</span></p> <p><span>Those issues were quickly overshadowed by a wave of seemingly suspicious Steam reviews posted for </span><i><span>Starsand Island </span></i><span>at launch, many of which were reportedly from users with less than an hour of total playtime and zero other reviews listed on their profiles. I say “reportedly,” because while several threads </span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/CozyGamers/comments/1r2r2ou/the_emerging_starsand_island_controversy_what_is/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button"><span>on Reddit</span></a><span> and the Steam </span><a href="https://steamcommunity.com/app/2966320/discussions/0/756177397086247029/"><span>discussion board</span></a><span> have discussed said reviews, dozens of these suspicious reviews have since disappeared from </span><i><span>Starsand Island’s </span></i><span>Steam page.</span></p>

 <p><span>Unfortunately for the devs, the <em>Starsand Island</em> Steam review rapture ended up bringing even more attention to the game’s strange launch. Yesterday, Seed Spark Lab released a </span><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2966320/view/501724120277319772"><span>community update</span></a><span> post on the life sim RPG’s</span><i><span>&nbsp;</span></i><span>Steam page and its official Discord titled “Announcement Regarding Artificial Comments.” It takes aim at the “large number of overly positive ‘praise’ comments about </span><i><span>Starsand Island</span></i><span> appearing across various social platforms.”</span></p> <p><span>“Is this some kind of overpraise as an attack? We have no concrete evidence, but it does feel as though someone may be doing this intentionally,” posits Seed Spark Lab. “What makes it even more puzzling is that this approach is not cheap, since leaving a review requires purchasing the game. (We later discovered that some of these accounts refunded the game after posting their reviews.)”</span></p>

 <p><span>They also noted that they believe the majority of these overly positive reviews “appeared to be AI-generated,” and “kindly” requested that whoever is behind the reviews “to stop.” Naturally, regardless of whether Seed Spark Lab’s plea was made in earnest or not, the community post has drawn </span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/pcgaming/comments/1r2wn61/please_let_us_focus_on_making_our_game_in_peace/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button"><span>even more negative attention</span></a><span> to </span><i><span>Starsand Island</span></i><span>. There really is no way to prove who is behind the reviews, so there’s little point in pointing fingers, but I have to wonder how anyone would benefit from damaging </span><i><span>Starsand Island’s</span></i><span> reputation by trying to inflate its rating on Steam. Reverse review-bombing with AI bots? What will PC gamers think of next?</span></p>

              <p>Best RPG winners <em>Metaphor: ReFantazio</em> and <em>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</em> are together at last. Sega revealed <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/bundle/66136/Clair_Obscur_Expedition_33_x_Metaphor_ReFantazio/">a new Steam bundle</a> that gives you an extra 10 percent off both games if you buy them together. That’s over 175 collective hours of drama-filled, turn-based dungeon grinding if you go the completionist route. <em>Metaphor: ReFantazio</em> director Katsura Hashino used the occasion to celebrate <em>Clair Obscur</em>‘s breakout success last year.</p> <p dir="ltr">“<em><span>Expedition</span>&nbsp;<span>33</span></em> is a work that conveys a deep understanding of and sincere dedication to the JRPG genre, crafted with great care down to the finest details. As someone who also creates RPGs, I found it to be truly inspiring,” Hashino, who’s been designing RPGs at Atlus since the 1990s, said in a press release. At a time when many franchises in the genre have moved toward more action-based combat, <em>Clair Obscur</em> showed turn-based mechanics could still keep evolving and appeal to a more general audience.</p>

 <p dir="ltr">“I am genuinely delighted to see Japanese-style RPGs being born and embraced, not only from Japanese-based studios like ours, but other places around the world through diverse creative approaches,” the <a href="https://kotaku.com/persona-5-phantom-x-english-release-date-announcement-1851780429"><em>Persona 5</em> director continued</a>. “While the two titles differ in their worlds and overall direction, players may find a shared spirit in how we each approach and express the RPG genre. I hope that this bundle encourages players to experience both titles and enjoy the breadth of what RPGs can offer.”</p> <p>Sandfall Interactive CEO And creative director Guillaume Broche had equally kind words for Metaphor: ReFantazio, a grittier fantasy RPG than Atlus’ usual games with shades of <em>Game of Thrones</em>. “The game has one of the most charismatic villains I’ve ever seen in an RPG,” Guillaume noted. He added that he’s been a big fan of Atlus’ work dating back to 2003’s <em>Shin Megami Tensei: Lucifer’s Call</em>, or as it was known in the West, <em>Shin Megami Tensei III: Nocturne</em>. That happened to be the first game in the series directed by Hashino himself.</p>

 <p>Last year, <a href="https://kotaku.com/persona-director-says-jrpg-3-0-is-coming-to-re-shape-the-genre-at-a-fundamental-level-2000647233">Hashino predicted a new renaissance</a> in the genre would lead to the birth of “JRPG 3.0.” While he didn’t say exactly what that would entail, he suggested it would include an innovative rethinking of the core concepts fans have come to expect from those types of games. “There will be a greater dimension to these games and they’ll change the genre’s structure and presentation at a fundamental level,” he said. For now there are more than enough JRPG 2.0 releases to keep people busy.</p>
