The raid happened on April 15, and police allegedly even took the YouTuber’s personal phone and didn’t return it until June. <br></p><p>According to Salicini’s video explaining the entire situation, law enforcement in Italy is apparently not required to disclose what he is being charged with or who specifically brought the charges against him until the initial investigation is finished. At that point, a judge would decide to dismiss the case or take it to trial.</p><p><em>Kotaku</em> has reached out to Salicini about his legal issues. </p><p> The complaint Salicini received from Guardia di Finanza cites him violating Article 171ter of Italian Copyright Law. That same complaint also lists Sony and Nintendo, but it’s possible that Italy’s Ministry of Economy and Finance was responsible for bringing forward the charges against the YouTuber. Salicini believes this is because he has reviewed retro handhelds from companies like Anbernic, which sometimes come pre-loaded with classic game ROMs. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/nintendo-valve-pc-dolphin-emulator-piracy-copyright-1850658946&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/nintendo-valve-pc-dolphin-emulator-piracy-copyright-1850658946">While emulation is legal</a></span>, ROMs exist in a weird, murky grey area.<br></p><p> The law that Salicini might have violated was written in 1941 and comes with a maximum punishment of €15,000 and up to three years of jail time. </p><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.gofundme.com/f/un-aiuto-per-chi-vorra-e-potra-ad-un-semplice-nerd-onesto&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.gofundme.com/f/un-aiuto-per-chi-vorra-e-potra-ad-un-semplice-nerd-onesto" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Salicini has started a GoFundMe to help cover his legal fees</a></span>.

It ain’t an easy task, as over 20 million games of <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/magnus-carlsen-jeans-chess-blitz-championship-fide-1851730179&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/magnus-carlsen-jeans-chess-blitz-championship-fide-1851730179">chess</a></span> are played on the platform every single day. But the team has gotten pretty good at detecting cheaters and banning their accounts. </p><p>One interesting stat that Chess.com’s Fair Play team shared in the blog post is that nearly 40 percent of closed accounts are less than two weeks old. This means the team’s methods of finding and punishing naughty players and bots are doing a solid job of catching cheaters early. But Chess.com thinks it can do an even better job at keeping cheaters out. </p><p>“One of the ways we’re tackling this phenomenon is by screening players more frequently early in their journey on the platform,” said Chess.com’s Fair Play team. “This means we’re generating reports for players that essentially serve as checkpoints as they play more games. It is entirely reasonable (and expected) that it may take time for someone to establish their rating, so these checkpoints go beyond games played and rating earned, but also include strength of play and over 100 other gameplay factors.”</p><p>The team also shared that it uses algorithms to look out for extraordinary examples of cheating or inhuman behavior. With only 30 people watching and 20 million games a day, it makes sense that the team would need extra help. All of this is in service of making sure most players who hop onto Chess.com have a good time.

Now this storyline and Malkovich’s performance have been cut from the final film.</p><p>“It was heartbreaking not to include him in the final version of the movie because he’s one of my very favorite humans and one of my biggest inspirations,” Shakman said. “As a person who walks the line between theater and film and television, there’s no one who is more inspiring than the founder of Steppenwolf Theater Company. What he’s done on stage as an actor and what he’s done as a director in theater as well as in film, and as just a film actor of incredible ability — I was honored he came to play.”</p><p>Maybe we’ll see this cut segment in a director’s cut or special features when the movie ends up on streaming. It’s also entirely possible Red Ghost appears in a future MCU movie. It would be a shame to have an actor of Malkovich’s caliber and just waste him on deleted scenes. <em>Fantastic Four: First Steps </em><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/fantastic-4-first-steps-pedro-pascal-mr-fantastic-reed-1851786015&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/fantastic-4-first-steps-pedro-pascal-mr-fantastic-reed-1851786015">comes to theaters on July 25</a></span>.</p></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://kotaku.com/fantastic-four-first-steps-john-malkovich-red-ghost-cut-1851786444]]></content:encoded>

Unknown Worlds would “maintain operational control of the Group companies in all material respects, including (for both existing and new products) product roadmap, launch, planning, partnering, budgeting and employee matters” as long as at least one of the cofounders remained employed there. </p><p>The founders claim the business relationship didn’t begin going south until earlier this year when projections for <em>Subnautica 2</em>'s sales were shared with Krafton management, one of which showed them hitting the targets required for the $250 million payout. “During the first week of April 2025, Unknown Worlds’ publishing colleagues in Krafton’s El Segundo, California office traveled to Korea to finalize the marketing and advertising strategy for <em>Subnautica 2</em>’s launch,” the lawsuit reads. “Upon their return, the El Segundo team—Krafton employees—reported to Gill that Krafton’s leadership was not focused on a successful launch, but instead on how it could convince Unknown Worlds to delay the game.”</p><p> Things came to a head in a May 2025 milestone review, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/subnautica-2-delay-lawsuit-leaks-biomes-steam-krafton-1851786101&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/subnautica-2-delay-lawsuit-leaks-biomes-steam-krafton-1851786101">portions of which leaked online last week</a></span>, in which Krafton argued the game needed more content and development time against the recommendation of the founders. From there, the founders alleged that Krafton began trying to sabotage the launch by locking down all publishing resources, failing to respond to emails with third-party partners, and claiming control over the final release date decision. </p><p>“One of Krafton’s El Segundo publishing employees reported to Gill that Krafton Headquarters told all Krafton teams to stop all creative tasks related to <em>Subnautica 2</em>,” the lawsuit reads. “The employee’s supervisor even demanded that he and his team cease communication with Unknown Worlds altogether.”</p><p>Then in June, according to the lawsuit, Krafton tried to get Cleveland, McGuire, and Gill to take a lower payout while also claiming that the founders were failing in their contractual obligations to the company. “On June 25, 2025, Krafton’s Head of Corporate Development told Gill that Krafton’s plan was to remove the Unknown Worlds board and fire the Founders,” the lawsuit reads.</p><p> “She warned Gill that ‘the lawyers are ready to go.’” They were fired roughly a week later, with termination letters from Striking Distance Studios CEO Steve Papoutsis, who has since taken over Unknown Worlds, blaming the founders’ “intention to proceed with a premature release of<em> Subnautica 2</em>.” According to the lawsuit, the firings were made “without cause,” and Krafton even went so far as to offer them their “post-termination payments and benefits” for being terminated “without cause.” </p><p>The lawsuit concludes:</p><blockquote data-type="BlockQuote"><p>In short, Krafton flagrantly breached both the letter and the spirit of the promises at the very core of its agreement to purchase Unknown Worlds. It promised to leave creative and operational control in the hands of the Founders. Promise broken. It promised to consult with the Founders before taking any action that could harm the earnout. Promise broken. It promised not to take any action with the primary business purpose of frustrating the earnout. Promise broken. And it promised not to terminate the Founders without Cause. Promise broken.</p></blockquote><p>The founders’ side of the story comes after weeks of vague statements on Reddit and confusing press releases from Krafton, who has argued that the founders were fired for failing to get <em>Subnautica 2</em> ready for a successful Early Access release. In particular, the leaked milestone review points to concerns that a lack of biomes and story content would result in the game failing to meet player expectations for a sequel. It’s denied that the prospective payout, 10 percent of which was due to some of Unknown Worlds’ roughly 100 developers, had anything to do with the management shakeup. </p><p>Caught in the middle are those working on the game who still need to deliver it, one way or the other. With <em>Subnautica 2 </em>now coming out in 2026, Krafton has promised employees that it will extend the bonus payout window to make up for the delay as well as advance them money from next year’s profit-sharing pool, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-07-15/krafton-extends-subnautica-2-bonus-period-is-sued-by-founders?accessToken=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJzb3VyY2UiOiJTdWJzY3JpYmVyR2lmdGVkQXJ0aWNsZSIsImlhdCI6MTc1MjYwOTQyNSwiZXhwIjoxNzUzMjE0MjI1LCJhcnRpY2xlSWQiOiJTWkdJMVNUMEcxS1cwMCIsImJjb25uZWN0SWQiOiJCMUVBQkI5NjQ2QUM0REZFQTJBRkI4MjI1MzgyQTJFQSJ9.eu_sHgKRf9uj-U3I1UDNgrJnNjE39Q3OcbLzDsn2xWY&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-07-15/krafton-extends-subnautica-2-bonus-period-is-sued-by-founders?accessToken=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJzb3VyY2UiOiJTdWJzY3JpYmVyR2lmdGVkQXJ0aWNsZSIsImlhdCI6MTc1MjYwOTQyNSwiZXhwIjoxNzUzMjE0MjI1LCJhcnRpY2xlSWQiOiJTWkdJMVNUMEcxS1cwMCIsImJjb25uZWN0SWQiOiJCMUVBQkI5NjQ2QUM0REZFQTJBRkI4MjI1MzgyQTJFQSJ9.eu_sHgKRf9uj-U3I1UDNgrJnNjE39Q3OcbLzDsn2xWY" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>Bloomberg</em> reported</a></span>.
