              <p>There are many reasons to kill a Leaper, <a href="https://kotaku.com/arc-raiders-review-extraction-loot-shooter-embark-2000642198"><i>Arc Raiders</i></a>’ terrifying robotic spider-like menace that can cross vast distances in seconds. The quest “Into the Fray” specifically asks you to take one out. Weekly trials frequently require you to damage or destroy a Leaper. They’re also a source of some solid loot. Their <a href="https://ardb.tools/items/leaper-pulse-unit">Pulse Units</a> do respectable damage as a throwable and they’re needed for stage four of the current Expedition Project. Here’s the best way to take them out.</p>   <p>While I’d wager Leapers, though intimidating, are the weakest of the larger Arc forces, their ability to traverse large distances quickly makes them a tough target. They can also crush you to death without much effort. Luckily, they’re large, they can’t squeeze into tight spaces, and they don’t fire any projectiles. So if you can find a safe spot with a clear sightline, and you’ve got the right weapons, their ass is grass.</p>

 <p>After spending nearly 200 hours in this game, I’ve found what I consider to be the best place for taking down a Leaper quickly, whether you’re running solo or in a crew. To get there you’re gonna head to Spaceport, specifically the center of the map near the Central Elevator. There’s a bunker northeast of the Elevator, sandwiched in between it and the South Trench Tower. That’s our spot.</p>

 <p><strong>Read More:&nbsp;</strong><a href="https://kotaku.com/arc-raiders-trade-fruit-loot-scrappy-lemons-mushrooms-2000649233">Extraction Shooter Player Puts Down Guns And Starts Selling Fruit Instead</a></p> <p>The only downside to this spot is that it’s in a wide open area, so you’re unlikely to be the only one who’ll join the fight and you’ll have to keep an eye out for hostile players. To be honest, this is also true of just about any place in the game. But this specific location has a few critical advantages when it comes to PvP and quick extraction, so let’s dive in.</p>

 <h2>Spaceport: The ultimate Leaper killing grounds</h2> <figure id="attachment_2000649669" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000649669"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000649669">© Screenshot: Embark Studios / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p>This bunker is an excellent location to dig in for a Leaper assault as both of its doors are pre-blocked (if you get there and there’s no option to breach the door, it means other players have broken in already). The Leaper won’t be able to climb into the bunker and, as I mentioned before, they don’t shoot projectiles, so if you stay away from the windows when it charges up its singularity area-of-effect attack, you’re basically untouchable while you pour the heat on our robotic spider pal.</p>

You’ll typically see it walking around near the Elevator, or close to the Launch Towers and Departure Building south of the Elevator.</p>

 <p>Sometimes, a Leaper will also spawn on the opposite, eastern side of the Launch Towers. In theory, you can lure one over to the aforementioned bunker, but it’s a hike and you open yourself to a lot of risk by doing so. If there’s no Leaper in the area near the bunker, I advise making yourself busy with something else and loading back into a new instance of the map where, hopefully, our prey will be waiting.</p>

 <h2>Step one: Arming up and fortifying the bunker</h2> <p><b><a href="https://kotaku.com/arc-raiders-guns-blue-green-purple-gold-best-2000644142">Any gun with Heavy Ammo</a> will deliver sufficient damage to the Leaper.</b> A maxed-out <a href="https://ardb.tools/weapons/ferro-i">Ferro</a> will do well, as will an <a href="https://ardb.tools/weapons/anvil-i">Anvil</a>. If you’re bringing either of those weapons, be sure to have a healthy amount of ammo. The Leaper will go down faster than you think, but it will take a lot of shots.</p> <p>Hullcrackers are okay, but I’d save those for bigger threats. Thrown explosives are also handy to have, though having said that, we’re going to be shooting the Leaper through a two-foot window in the bunker and there’s a good chance that in the chaos of your assault, you may screw up the throw and end up bouncing the grenade back into the bunker and, well, that’s a less-than-ideal situation.</p> <p><strong>Read More:</strong> <a href="https://kotaku.com/arc-raiders-inventory-full-stash-loadout-crafting-cheat-sheet-2000643629">The Hoarder’s Guide To Managing Your <em>Arc Raiders</em> Inventory</a></p> <p>If you’re at all a fan of <i>Rainbow Six: Siege</i>, you’re going to <i>love </i>this next part. Any combination of the following items will help make your mission more successful:</p>

 <ul> <li aria-level="1"><a href="https://ardb.tools/items/barricade-kit">Barricade Kit</a></li> <li aria-level="1"><a href="https://ardb.tools/items/door-blocker">Door Blocker</a></li> <li aria-level="1">Any trap or mine (Blaze Grenade Traps, Jolt Mines, or even Trigger ‘Nades will work well)</li> <li aria-level="1"><a href="https://ardb.tools/items/lure-grenade">Lure Grenade</a> (good for sending the Leaper or other Arc away from you if things get messy)</li> </ul> <p>While the Leaper can’t get into the bunker, other players can and <a href="https://kotaku.com/arc-raiders-pvp-betrayal-bounty-rat-camp-2000649163">there’s no guarantee that they’ll be friendly</a>. So we have to do what we can to make it hard for other players to get inside while you’re taking on the Leaper.</p> <p>Good thing the bunker is pre-blocked! Other players can break those blocks, but they make a lot of sound while doing so, which can buy you time to shift your focus to the invading threat.</p> <p>But you’ll need to smash one of the blocks yourself to get in. I recommend picking the west-facing door to break open. <b>Once you’re inside, immediately block that door again with a Door Blocker </b><b><i>or</i></b><b> place Barricade Kits right up to both doors</b>. (You can get the Barricade Kit close enough to the door frame that you can’t walk past it on the western door. This is harder to do on the eastern door, hence the reason I advise leaving that door untouched when you break in).</p>

 <figure id="attachment_2000649667" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000649667"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000649667">© Screenshot: Embark Studios / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p>At this point, with doors blocked or barricaded, you’ll have bought yourself some valuable time from invading players looking to take advantage of you. Also, since there’ll be a Leaper jumping around the bunker as you attack it, enemy players open themselves up to serious risk if they try to break through the door blocks or take down the barricades.</p> <p>Still, there’s a chance an enemy player can get in to ruin your day. It can be hard to hear an enemy player breaching a door or taking down a barricade while the Leaper is making a racket while bouncing around.</p> <p>That’s where the traps come in handy. Go nuts here with whatever you have: Place Jolt Mines in front of the door or behind barricades. Rig the door with Blaze Grenade Traps. You could even place some <a href="https://ardb.tools/items/laser-trap-lure">Lure Traps</a> which in theory would go off, sending the Leaper to the doorway and calling over any nearby drones, positioning the invading player in between you and Arc threats.</p>

 <p>You can also place some Explosive Mines at the doors too, but I’d be wary of the shrapnel inside the bunker hitting you. There’s risk of that with the Jolt Mine too, but those just temporarily stun and don’t do any damage.</p> <h2>Step two: Luring the Leaper and commencing the attack</h2> <p>Once you’ve fortified the bunker, you should be able to spot a Leaper from inside. There’s usually one patrolling south of the bunker. If there’s no Leaper in the area, you may have to just reload into a new instance. It’s a common area for our spider pal, so you’ll see one eventually. Just fire a shot at it to get its attention and let it race over to try and attack you.</p> <figure id="attachment_2000649668" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000649668"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000649668">© Screenshot: Embark Studios / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p>Since it can’t get into the bunker, it won’t be much of a threat to you. Its charged-up area-of-effect attack <i>can</i> do damage if you’re close enough to the window, so if you see it charging up, just back away from the window.</p> <p><b>Prioritize your fire on its eye.</b> Just keep pouring the damage in. It’ll go faster if you’re with friends, but this is a perfectly soloable activity provided you brought enough ammo. Also, <a href="https://youtu.be/qLlNpSXlgAM">it sure would be nice if you had some grenades</a> or <a href="https://ardb.tools/items/wolfpack">Wolfpacks</a> (just be careful throwing them).</p>

 <p>The Leaper isn’t a total fool, however. After taking enough damage without returning any, it will start to walk away from the bunker. If you keep shooting it, however, you’ll retrigger its aggravated state and it will continue to try and jump on top of the bunker and squeeze into the windows. But try as it might, it can’t.</p> <p>Keep shooting and it will eventually go down.</p> <h2>Step three: Loot (if you need it) and GTFO</h2> <p>You’re going to make <i>a ton</i> of racket with this assault. Any nearby players who are looking to take advantage of you might wait until you’re looting the wreckage to jump you. So, once the Leaper’s dead, head out, grab what you need and then race over to the nearby Elevator to extract.</p>

 <p>Unless you’re doing a Night Raid (where Elevators are your only way out), I advise using a <a href="https://ardb.tools/items/raider-hatch-key">Raider Hatch Key</a> to get out somewhere else so you don’t have to mess around with any rats camping the Elevator.</p> <h2>Closing thoughts and considerations</h2> <figure id="attachment_2000649670" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000649670"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000649670">© Screenshot: Embark Studios / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p>Just about any place similar to this bunker will be a good spot for taking out a Leaper. That said, this particular bunker on Spaceport is advantageous given its proximity to an Elevator for quick extraction, the fact that the doors come pre-blocked, and its right near a common Leaper spawn point.</p>

 <p>There is a pre-blocked bunker south of the Central Elevator that also may work, but it’s a bit too close to the Departures and Arrivals Building where hostile players may be waiting to snipe or jump you.</p> <p><b>Also, if you’re taking out a Leaper for a weekly trial, be sure to run this tactic during a Night Raid or an Electromagnetic Storm since it will double the trial points.</b> The storms are riskier if you want to loot the remains as you open yourself up to a lightning strike, however.</p> <p>There are many other places across <i>Arc Raiders</i>’ current maps to take out Leapers, but this bunker in Spaceport is by far the most reliable spot to just load in and kill one while covering your ass from any rats looking to ruin your day.</p> <p>Happy hunting!</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/helldivers-2-install-size-large-smaller-pc-update-150gb-arrowhead-2000649639</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/helldivers-2-kotaku-review-pc-ps5-is-it-good-ps-plus-1851258251"><em>Helldivers 2</em></a> on PC is a solid version of Sony’s 2024 online co-op shooter. However, one significant flaw of the PC port was its massive installation size, which took up around 150GB of space and was approximately three times larger than the game on console. Arrowhead promised this would be cut down. And a new update does just that.</p> <p>On December 2, <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/553850/view/491583942944621371">Arrowhead Games posted a lengthy and detailed post</a> about the studio’s efforts to make the PC port of <em>Helldivers 2</em> less bloated. According to the team behind the sci-fi shooter, <em>Helldivers 2’s</em> total installation size on PC has been reduced from approximately 154 GB to around 23GB. That’s over 130GB slashed, which is <em>wild</em>. Arrowhead thanked support studio Nixxes, which apparently helped get the install size down to such a small amount.</p>

 <p>So why was <em>Helldivers 2</em> on PC so big compared to the console ports?<a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/553850/view/543369627969783286?l=english"> Well, as explained in this post from Arrowhead back in October</a>, <em>Helldivers 2</em> on PC supports both solid-state drives and older mechanical hard drives. In an effort to keep load times down and make<em> Helldivers 2</em> more optimized, Arrowhead included redundant and repeated files so that older drives that still spin tiny platters and seek out data wouldn’t be bogged down as much. This was a common technique back when games shipped on optical discs and when consoles didn’t use much faster solid-state drives. <a href="https://kotaku.com/helldivers-2-xbox-series-x-s-release-date-ps5-exclusive-1851785573">That’s also why the Xbox and PS5 ports of <em>Helldivers 2</em></a> were smaller in size: Those devices all have SSDs and don’t need redundant, repeated data to optimize loading.</p>

 <p>The majority of what was removed from<em> Helldivers 2</em> in the most recent update on PC were these redundant files. That might make you worry about players on PC still using older drives, but Arrowhead says load times for players on older systems will only be increased by a few seconds, a worthy tradeoff to get the file size below 25 GB.</p> <p>For now, this update is optional on PC as Arrowhead continues testing it to make sure nothing was overlooked. But eventually, sometime next year, this reduction in installation size will be mandatory as the studio doesn’t want to support two different versions of the game on PC.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/metroid-prime-4-reviews-is-it-good-switch-2-nintendo-2000649621</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>18 years after <em>Metroid Prime 3</em> launched and <a href="https://kotaku.com/nintendo-announces-metroid-prime-4-1796058481">eight years after the sequel was first announced</a>, Nintendo and Rare have finally finished<em> Metroid Prime 4: Beyond.</em> The long-awaited follow-up arrives later this week on Switch and Switch 2. And on December 2, ahead of release, reviews from critics went live across multiple outlets. In summary, <em>Prime 4</em> isn’t a bad game. But it doesn’t sound like a masterpiece either, falling short of past entries in the first-person shooter series.</p> <p>Launching on December 4, <em>Metroid Prime 4</em> is Nintendo’s last big game of 2025 and has a lot of hype and hope surrounding it. Fans have been wanting an <a href="https://kotaku.com/nintendo-switch-2-pro-metroid-prime-4-zelda-mario-1850098941">entire console generation</a>. So when previews last month featured an overly talkative sidekick, a big departure from the often atmospheric and empty worlds of past <em>Prime</em> games, people were nervous. Would players quickly grow tired of some bumbling sidekick?</p>

 <p>The good news is that many reviews, even the less glowing ones, indicate that <em>Prime 4</em>‘s human characters aren’t overly annoying and aren’t as big a part of<em> Prime 4</em> as some had feared. Another concern fans had involved the open world connecting the various areas of <em>Metroid Prime 4</em>, which Samus Aran traverses on a motorcycle. Many critics, even those who found the bike cool, weren’t convinced this was a necessary inclusion.</p> <p>Narratively, the world you explore in<em> Prime 4</em> is reportedly filled with excellent worldbuilding and lore teases, but some complained that this latest entry doesn’t feel like a complete story. Instead, it seems like it’s teasing the start of something more. <a href="https://kotaku.com/fans-who-pre-ordered-metroid-prime-4-six-years-ago-have-seen-their-entire-lives-change-2000645936">Hopefully, if <em>Metroid Prime 4</em> gets a sequel, fans won’t have to wait another decade for it.</a></p> <hr> <h2><em><a href="https://www.pcmag.com/reviews/metroidhttps://www.pcmag.com/reviews/metroid-prime-4-beyond-prime-4-beyond">PC Mag</a></em></h2> <blockquote><p>At worst, these characters are somewhat stock, providing a contrast against a singularly awe-inspiring figure like Samus. For example, there’s a chatty nerd and an old, gruff general. They leave you alone for long stretches of the journey, so when they’re deployed, it’s with purpose. Initially, your comrades explain tutorials at base camp. Later, they pop up for set-piece moments that advance the story and diversify the gameplay. In a nice touch, soldiers aid you in battle if you can protect them, and a hulking robot companion clears paths blocked by debris. There are some neat hints of worldbuilding as one teammate explains his spiritual beliefs, which sets up a lovely payoff. These supporting characters are Beyond’s weakest element, but they’re inoffensive and serve their purpose well. As always, <em>Metroid’s</em> real story is between you and the planet.</p></blockquote> <h2><a href="https://www.polygon.com/metroid-prime-4-beyond-review/"><em>Polygon</em></a></h2> <blockquote><p><em>Metroid Prime 4</em> thinks you are very, very stupid. Like, unbelievably dimwitted. At one point, I’m running through a room that only has one exit and one entrance. My companion runs over to the only other door I can walk through and shouts “This must be the way!” Later, I blast down a machine while standing on a bridge. Everything explodes around me in a cinematic and the camera focuses on a morph ball-sized hole that has appeared in the chaos. The scene continues long enough for a soldier to point directly at the hole and tell me that it’s the way out. I gain map data for an area at some point and a pop-up tells me that I can press the minus button on my controller to open it. A companion chimes in: “Wanna check your map?” I get it. Metroid games can be alienating for mainstream audiences, and the series has always struggled to find commercial success. Having linear biomes and tighter direction helps ease the on-ramp for players who are intimidated by the idea of getting lost.</p> <p>But Retro Studios has already solved for that time and time again: cutscenes that telegraph where to go, a scan feature that tells players exactly how to kill bosses, on-screen button prompts. The soldiers don’t replace any of those ideas; they quite literally talk over them. You now get up to three nudges at a time when you encounter an obstacle. And all of that is happening in the&nbsp;<em>one&nbsp;</em>major Nintendo series that isn’t geared towards its youngest players.</p></blockquote> <h2><em><a href="https://gameinformer.com/review/metroid-prime-4-beyond/worth-the-wait">Game Informer</a></em></h2> <blockquote><p>The first-person action gameplay is familiar to previous Prime games and feels good. Samus’ new psychic powers don’t radically change the fun lock-on, shooter gameplay, but I enjoyed remote controlling the Control Beam at opportune times in boss fights and to solve puzzles. The pacing and unfolding of each location are immaculately designed, funneling you toward objectives while consistently planting seeds that make you want to return later with expanded abilities. The desert hub area where Samus drives her motorcycle between objectives is the perfect size: Big enough that the motorcycle feels necessary, but not so big that you are ever driving for too long.</p></blockquote> <h2><em><a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/metroid/metroid-prime-4-beyond-review/">GamesRadar+&nbsp;</a></em></h2> <blockquote> <p id="bf1a2720-ff20-45e4-b300-098b15f2c95a">The overworld, the dune-covered Sol Valley, feels similarly dated conceptually, and, again, closer to classic <em>Zelda</em> than any kind of&nbsp;<em>The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild</em> twist I hesitantly expected – especially considering there are literally shrines that offer small puzzle challenges. There’s so few you can count them on two hands, and basically all amount to walking into a room and seeing if you have the power-up to progress or not – this is no bite-size revolution of the <em>Metroid</em> formula but something to fill an otherwise fairly empty open world map Sol Valley is how Samus accesses each of the five main key-hiding areas, which does make it the largest completely interconnected open world Metroid has ever had. Sort of. The problem is how much of a rigmarole it is to get back and forth between anywhere.</p> </blockquote> <h2><em><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/metroid-prime-4-beyond-review">Eurogamer</a></em></h2> <blockquote><p>The central desert, which you’ll be crossing often as you go back and forth between the main areas, is fun enough. Vi-O-La, the bike, is a blast to drive, with a few fun and simple mechanics to experiment with. The desert does give the impression, though, that it was designed separately from the rest of the game. I genuinely wonder if it was outsourced to a different team. Even the loading zones seem to suggest this, as it doesn’t even directly connect to the dungeons. In each case, there’s a loading zone, then a tiny ‘staging’ area you can cross in about a minute,&nbsp;<em>then</em>&nbsp;the dungeon.</p></blockquote> <h2><em><a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/review/metroid-prime-4-beyond-review/">VGC</a></em></h2> <blockquote><p><em>Metroid Prime 4</em> is a Frankenstein fusion of ideas, which at its peaks delivers some great series moments, but at its troughs, feels like a dilution of the formula that made these games beloved in the first place. Throughout Prime 4, players neck-jerk between horror-style FPS sequences, open-world vehicle exploration, and comedy banter between a crew of wisecracking support characters. It’s an experience that feels like a collage of styles plucked from past Samus Aran adventures,&nbsp;<em>The Legend of Zelda,</em> and&nbsp;<em>Halo</em>, but never really settles into a clear identity.</p></blockquote> <h2><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/metroid-prime-4-beyond-review-prime-but-not-quite-prime-prime/1900-6418446/"><em>Gamespot</em></a></h2> <blockquote><p>All of this is delivered with a visual fidelity on Switch 2 that is among the best we’ve seen on a Nintendo system. Sometimes particular details can look a little rough–some of the flora in Fury Green, or the industrial mesh grating of the Volt Forge, for instance–but other times it’s stunning. The frozen-over laboratory of the Ice Belt, or the futuristic beauty of Lamorn architecture in its artifacts, are particularly strong. It won’t match the best we’ve seen on PC or higher-powered consoles, but it’s a beautiful game regardless. Plus, I just love the look of Samus’ new suit, and in cutscene close-ups, the fidelity did it a lot of favors by showing the layers of its textures and materials.</p></blockquote> <h2><em><a href="https://www.inverse.com/gaming/metroid-prime-4-beyond-review">Inverse</a></em></h2> <blockquote><p>It’s possible that a version of <em>Metroid Prime 4</em>&nbsp;that leaned into the open-world aspects or even the party of secondary characters could work, but as it is now, both feel bolted onto a game that would be much better without them. Ultimately, much of&nbsp;<em>Metroid Prime 4</em>&nbsp;feels like a failed experiment. As great as it is to explore the lightning-struck Volt Forge or pick through the haunted remains of the Ice Belt facility, the game’s standout moments are buried in drudgery.&nbsp;<em>Metroid Prime 4</em> is thrilling at times, set across consistently beautiful environments, but it can’t stop getting in its own way.</p></blockquote>
