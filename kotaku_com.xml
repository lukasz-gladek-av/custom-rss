              <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/ghost-of-yotei-tsushima-protagonist-atsu-wolf-ps5-1851657667"><em>Ghost of Yōtei Legends</em></a> will bring multiplayer to Sony’s fall blockbuster, though not until next year. The cooperative online mode will arrive as free DLC sometime in 2026.</p> <p>For anyone unfamiliar with the mode from the original game, <a href="https://kotaku.com/im-going-to-play-the-shit-out-of-ghost-of-tsushima-s-ne-1845397850"><em>Legends</em> was a multiplayer spin-off for <em>Ghost of Tsushima</em></a> that had players team-up online to take down mythical challenges in a new series of story missions, fight off waves of enemies in a horde-like survival mode, or compete with other players to see who could rack up the highest score. There were character classes, difficulty ranks, and unlockable cosmetics. Is was one of those multiplayer add-ons to a single-player adventure that was way better than it had any right to be.</p> <p><iframe loading="lazy" title="Ghost of Yōtei - &quot;Song of Vengeance&quot; Trailer | PS5 Games" width="500" height="281" src="about:blank" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen="" data-rocket-lazyload="fitvidscompatible" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/FM08YoziYJs?feature=oembed"></iframe></p> <p>A <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/08/19/ghost-of-yotei-legends-dlc-is-coming-in-2026/">PlayStation Blog post</a> suggests things will work pretty much the same in <em>Ghost of Yotei Legends</em>. But this time the story missions will revolve around teaming up to take down members of the Yōtei Six, the main antagonists of the single-player campaign. They’ll be accompanied by new enemies, however, and presumably have other, more challenging tricks up their sleeves. The return of the survival mode is also confirmed, though it’s currently unclear if that will include the 2v2 contest option as well. It sounds like Sucker Punch will reveal more details once <em>Ghost of Yotei</em> is out on October 2.</p> <p>The original <em>Ghost of Tsushima</em> multiplayer mode was one of Sony’s more successful first-party forays into live service content. Its popularity among fans made it seem like a slam dunk for a full-blown standalone spin-off game. But despite the literal billions Sony has poured into trying to get a fleet of live service games off the ground,<em> Legends</em> hasn’t been among the projects released or canceled, at least that we know of. If anything, the success of<a href="https://kotaku.com/elden-ring-nightreign-review-in-progress-difficulty-1851782700"><em> Elden Ring Nightreign</em></a> proves there’s definitely players out there who want innovative coop riffs on traditional single-player games. We’ll see if<em> Ghost of Yotei Legends</em> can satisfy some of that pent up demand when it arrives next year.</p>

<p>This year’s Gamescom has officially kicked off. That means that today, we were treated to a trailer-laden showcase known as Opening Night Live, straight from Cologne, Germany and featuring none other than Geoff Keighley.</p> <p>ONL was pretty packed this year, with some solid trailers and reveals of many awesome-looking games. As always, we’ve rounded up everything that caught our eye. It was a dense show, so read on!</p> <hr> <h2><span id="hollow-knight-silksong"></span><em>Hollow Knight: Silksong</em><span></span></h2> <p><iframe loading="lazy" title="Host Geoff Keighley Kicks Off gamescom Opening Night Live 2025" width="500" height="281" src="about:blank" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen="" data-rocket-lazyload="fitvidscompatible" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/94P9Upb_qjQ?feature=oembed"></iframe></p> <p>While we didn’t get a firm release <em>date</em> of the ever-elusive sequel to <em>Hollow</em> <em>Knight</em>, Geoff Keighley took to the Gamescom stage to officially declare that the game is coming out <em>this year </em>and to show off some new gameplay. A more in-depth presentation from developer Team Cherry <a href="https://kotaku.com/hollow-knight-silksong-announcement-gamescom-stream-2000618437">is coming on Thursday</a>.</p> <p><strong><em>Hollow Knight Silksong </em>launches in 2025.</strong></p> <hr> <h2><span id="call-of-duty-black-ops-7"></span><em>Call of Duty: Black Ops 7</em><span></span></h2> <p><iframe loading="lazy" title="Call of Duty: Black Ops 7 World Premiere Trailer | gamescom Opening Night Live 2025" width="500" height="281" src="about:blank" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen="" data-rocket-lazyload="fitvidscompatible" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/egA6Pj485eA?feature=oembed"></iframe></p> <p>The world is in a bad place in 2035 according to <em>Black Ops 7</em>, so it’s a good thing you’ve got a gun and a willingness to shoot people. I mean, that’s the premise for all these kindsa things, but at least the level design looks surprisingly batty! I’ll take it. I will <em>not</em> take this version of Metallica’s “Master of Puppets,” though.</p>

I am so here for this game.</p>

              <p>Today, at the very end of Gamescom Opening Night Live, Geoff had one more secret to reveal: The developers behind the <a href="https://kotaku.com/black-myth-wukong-review-soulslike-pc-ps5-1851629456">super-popular action RPG <em>Black Myth: Wukong</em></a> are working on a new game, <em>Black Myth: Zhong Kui,</em> starring a new mythical hero.</p> <p>Here’s the very short teaser for<em> Zhong Kui</em>, which doesn’t have a release date yet:</p> <p><iframe loading="lazy" title="Game Science's New Title | Black Myth: Zhong Kui - Teaser Trailer (Chinese Dub)" width="500" height="281" src="about:blank" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen="" data-rocket-lazyload="fitvidscompatible" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/sqe3j4Qch1Y?feature=oembed"></iframe></p> <p><em>Black Myth: Zhong Kui</em> isn’t a direct sequel to <em>Wukong</em>. <a href="https://www.gamesci.cn/zhongkui">On the new game’s official website, the devs explained</a> that they wanted to “build more distinct game experiences, to challenge ourselves with bolder features” and work on “fresh ideas.” However, they did tease an actual sequel or DLC to <em>Wukong</em>, saying: “And to all friends who love <em>Black Myth: Wukong</em>, the westward journey won’t end here.”</p>

 <p>It should also be noted that, despite a slick-looking CG trailer showing off the new mythical hero and setting, Game Science admits it doesn’t have much to show because the game is still very early in development, saying that <em>Zhong Kui</em> is “little more than an empty folder at this stage.” However, the devs said they love announcing new things and updating fans on August 20, so they created a CG short to “let everyone know that a new project has kicked off.” But yeah, don’t expect to be playing this game anytime soon.</p> <p>According to Game Science,<em> Black Myth: Zhong Kui</em>, like <a href="https://kotaku.com/new-souls-like-looks-cool-even-if-it-might-never-come-o-1844786724"><em>Wukong</em></a>, is a single-player action RPG that will follow “the same business model as before.” That seems to imply that this sequel won’t be free-to-play when it eventually launches.</p> <p>“However, you won’t be playing a monkey role this time,” explained the studio. “That said, we’re still exploring and experimenting with the concrete differences between <em>Wukong</em> and <em>Zhong Kui.</em> So take it easy—let us impress ourselves first before we serve it to you.”</p> <p>On August 20, 2024, <em>Black Myth: Wukong</em> launched on PlayStation 5 and PC and quickly became a massive hit. The game saw over 2.4 million concurrent players on Steam alone, beating out popular games like <em>Counter-Strike 2, Dota 2, Elden Ring, Cyberpunk,</em> and many more. It still, to this day, <a href="https://kotaku.com/black-myth-wukong-steam-game-pass-cyberpunk-elden-ring-1851626674">holds the record for second-highest number of players all online at the same time on Steam</a>, only beaten by <em>PUBG’s</em> massive 3.2 concurrent players record. Needless to say, a lot of people are excited for more<em> Black Myth</em>, and I expect that when <em>Zhong Kui</em> eventually arrives on PC and consoles, it will be as big if not bigger.</p>
