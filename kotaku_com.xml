            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>The lore-YouTuber-to-book-publisher pipeline is alive and well. <em>Borderlands 4</em> has another busted exploit, and fired Rockstar devs aren’t going quietly. Welcome to the latest edition of Morning Checkpoint,&nbsp;<em>Kotaku</em>‘s daily roundup of gaming news and culture. According to a handful of Polymarket weirdos, <em>Half-Life 3</em> has a 56 percent chance of being announced before 2027 but only a 7 percent chance of arriving before the end of 2025. Fans are <a href="https://kotaku.com/half-life-3-timeline-hype-leaks-clues-explained-release-date-november-trailer-2000645448">getting ready either way</a>.</p> <h2><em>Elden Ring</em>‘s unofficial YouTube lore master is putting out a 400-page book</h2>  <p>Michael “VaatiVidya” Samuels’ YouTube channel is where everyone who loves FromSoftware games but can’t make heads or tails of their stories while playing goes to figure out what the hell is actually going on. He’ll now be boiling down dozens of hours of video into a more digestible form, assuming you belong to an age cohort that’s still literate. <em>Lore Bound: Elden Ring Explained</em> starts at just $42 for the softback version and comes with a magnificent cover.</p>

 <p>“This book will bind together everything I’ve learned from <em>Elden Ring</em>, <em>Shadow of the Erdtree</em>, and <em>Nightreign</em> into one single volume,” VaatiVidya <a href="https://www.youtube.com/post/Ugkxxl2QfRJDpRsk_HP0kzlQBg9jYy1PQU6D">said on YouTube</a>. “My old video scripts will be updated, new illustrations will be commissioned, and every effort will be made to ensure each page is clear and engaging.” It arrives just in time to explain the games before the upcoming Hollywood adaptation arrives. <a href="https://kotaku.com/elden-ring-movie-alex-garland-hidetaka-miyazaki-atari-2000620675">I’m sure Alex Garland will be buying a copy</a>.</p>

 <h2><em>Borderlands 4</em> glitch lets you speedrun the skill tree</h2> <p>Normally, you have to invest tons of points per Vault Hunter to unlock their strongest abilities at the bottom of their skill trees. There’s a shortcut, however. YouTuber&nbsp;<a href="https://www.youtube.com/@Joltzdude139" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Joltzdude139</a> (via <a href="https://www.thegamer.com/borderlands-4-glitch-unlock-late-game-skills-without-wasting-points/"><em>The Gamer</em></a>) explains how it works. The glitch revolves around repeatedly using the “dump all points option” and reversing it to trick the game into thinking you’ve spent more points than you have.</p>

 <p>Time consuming though it may be, it eventually unlocks the whole tree without using all your points to engineer more busted builds, at least until it <a href="https://x.com/ProdigyXL/status/1990927794000572519?s=20">gets patched out</a>. The full video <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwmTrfhPuhw">will take you through all the steps</a>.</p> <h2>Fired <em>GTA 6</em> devs are still protesting outside Rockstar</h2> <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">Fired GTA 6 devs held a protest outside the Rockstar offices in Edinburgh and the Scottish Parliament</p> <p>"GTA 6 will make billions… But I want people to think of the human cost" <a href="https://t.co/pssbIt30LK">pic.twitter.com/pssbIt30LK</a></p> <p>— Dexerto (@Dexerto) <a href="https://twitter.com/Dexerto/status/1990857470000967749?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 18, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <p>“I was scared at first, I was apprehensive to join,” one of them said outside the studio’s Edinburgh office this week, <a href="https://www.dexerto.com/gta/fired-gta-6-devs-speak-out-about-working-conditions-at-rockstar-at-protests-outside-offices-3284831/"><em>Dexerto</em> reports</a>. “Like many of my colleagues in QA I always felt a bit more dispensable and a bit less skilled than workers in other departments,” he said. “I thought that by joining the union, I could be putting a target on my back. No one should ever feel this way when organizing in their workplace.”</p>

 <p>The studio has yet to elaborate on the firings beyond accusing the developers of leaking company secrets. The matter is currently awaiting review before the UK’s employment tribunal. <em>GTA 6</em> is currently set to release exactly one year from today.</p>

 <h2>Having trouble reviving friends in <em>Battlefield 6</em>? You’re not alone</h2> <p>The shooter’s latest major patch apparently <a href="https://twitter.com/DRUNKKZ3/status/1990751823146389872?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1990751823146389872%7Ctwgr%5Ef30118f2c4253b9223e8b70a1499cb41306c14da%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.thegamer.com%2Fbattlefield-6-defibs-broken-latest-update%2F">broke defibrillators</a>. Many players have reported “watching friendlies try and revive right now and so many of the hits are failing.” The game’s designers are already <a href="http://I've seen quite a few reports yeah, will investigate what's happening">investigating the issue</a>, so a fix might be on the way by this weekend.</p>

 <h2>Where is <em>Dragon’s Dogma 2</em>‘s big expansion?</h2> <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">YOU'RE WELCOME NOW GIVE US DLC PLEASE <a href="https://t.co/PaN5bzYr0e">https://t.co/PaN5bzYr0e</a></p> <p>— FightinCowboy (@Fightincowboy) <a href="https://twitter.com/Fightincowboy/status/1990950415048061015?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 19, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <p>Fans are still hoping for a <em>Dark Arisen</em>-style DLC now that the friction-filled action-RPG has sold 4 million copies. Hideaki Itsuno left to join Tencent’s LightSpeed Studios shortly after release, however, so who knows what Capcom is planning.</p> <h2><em>Dragon Quest 7</em> is being reimagined as a shorter game</h2> <p>Usually, remakes add more content. <em>Dragon Quest 7 Reimagined</em> will take some out. The PS1 version was already over 100 hours. The 3DS remaster was a bit shorter. Square Enix is cutting even more content to streamline the latest version. “Some of the [stories] have now been made optional, so you can play them in any order you want,” producer Takeshi Ichikawa <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/dragon-quest/at-100-hours-dragon-quest-7-is-an-enormous-jrpg-so-in-the-reimagined-remake-a-few-of-the-stories-which-werent-100-percent-relevant-to-the-main-storyline-have-just-been-cut-entirely/">told <em>Gamesradar</em></a>.” He added, “a few of the stories which weren’t 100 percent relevant to the main storyline have just been cut entirely.” I hope the <em>Final Fantasy VII Remake</em> team isn’t listening.</p> <h2>ICYMI:</h2> <ul> <li><a href="https://kotaku.com/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-review-campaign-is-it-good-zombies-multiplayer-2000645198"><em>The Call of Duty: Black Ops 7</em> campaign is very weird and very bad</a></li> <li><a href="https://kotaku.com/morsels-roguelike-binding-isaac-pokemon-2000645175">Morsels, on the other hand, is super surreal and incredibly cool</a></li> <li><a href="https://kotaku.com/take-two-strauss-zelnick-gta-6-pc-console-exclusive-2000645103">Is the center of gaming really moving from console to PC?</a></li> </ul> <h2>Watch this:</h2>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/hurry-to-nab-the-powera-wireless-controller-mario-joy-edition-for-just-27-today-2000645239</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/the-powera-mario-controller-for-switch-is-now-the-cheapest-nintendo-licensed-steal-at-nearly-50-off.1358296/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Amazon has started offering its early Black Friday deals, and if you’re a Nintendo Switch player, one of the best gaming accessories is currently going for nearly half off. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5697/">The PowerA wireless controller (Mario Joy Edition) is down to just $27, thanks to a 46% discount that’s live on Amazon right now.</a></p>
<p>The discount is open to both Prime and non-Prime members, but Prime members will also enjoy free shipping on their orders. Even better, you don’t need to worry about entering any weird coupon codes or following complicated checkout processes to score the discount. Just add the item to your cart, and the discount applies automatically. The offer, however, is selling fast, which means it won’t be around for much longer. Grab it while it is still live!</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5697/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Comfortable to Use for Long Gaming Sessions</h2>
<p>This fun red controller has a lot of personality. There’s a Mario graphic on the side, plus colorful buttons that elevate the look while sticking to the overall theme. The ergonomic design makes it comfortable to hold, so you can game for hours without ending up with sore palms. You’re getting a familiar button layout with precision analog sticks, a full-size D-pad, and all the essential ABXY and shoulder buttons.</p>
<p>The controller plays nicely with all current models, including the Nintendo Switch, Switch OLED, Switch Lite, and even the latest Switch 2. It runs on AA batteries that offer up to 40 hours of gameplay. You can easily go a couple of weeks without worrying about swapping them out. And since it’s wireless, you can move around freely without a cable getting in the way. Sitting back, standing up, or just passing it around; gaming is going to be convenient.</p>



<p>Just note that it doesn’t support HD rumble, IR camera, or Amiibo NFC scanning, like most other options in this range. If that isn’t a dealbreaker for you, this PowerA wireless controller in Mario Joy is a great option to consider otherwise. It not only looks cool, but offers solid performance. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5697/">The compatibility is impressive as well, as so is the battery. This deal brings the price down to just $27 after a massive 46% discount.</a></p>
<p>This is the lowest we have seen it drop to in a long while, but the retailer is likely going to push the price back up soon. Act fast before that happens!</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Why The Internet Thinks Half-Life 3 Is Being Announced Today]]></title>
            <link>https://kotaku.com/half-life-3-timeline-hype-leaks-clues-explained-release-date-november-trailer-2000645448</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/why-the-internet-thinks-half-life-3-is-being-announced-today.1358293/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Over the last few weeks, you might have noticed something odd. A lot of people seem to think that <em>Half-Life 3</em> is about to be announced. Some folks have dates marked for when we should expect the sequel. There are even some who think <em>Half-Life 3</em> will be announced at the Game Awards. And a lot of people seem to believe that <em>Half-Life 3</em> is real and nearly finished despite, you know, Valve never confirming that. So uh, what’s going on?</p> <p>Since 2021, d<a href="https://miro.com/app/board/uXjVINqBTwM=/?moveToWidget=3458764648489439347&amp;cot=14">ataminers have been finding and documenting many snippets of code</a> left in other Valve projects, like<em> DOTA 2</em>, related to something known internally at Valve as “HLX.” And while Valve hasn’t told us what&nbsp;HLX refers to, fans and dataminers have connected a lot of dots over the last four years or so.</p>

 <p>From what has been found, HLX appears to be a single-player, non-VR FPS featuring a character in an HEV suit who fights aliens and soldiers through various levels while possibly solving physics-based puzzles. Now, that sounds a lot like a new <em>Half-Life</em> game. And most of the community following HLX, as well as multiple reliable leakers, have started to call this datamined project <em>Half-Life 3.</em></p>

 <p>The fact that Valve has been working quietly on what appears to be a new <em>Half-Life</em> game for at least roughly five years, and likely longer than that, has created some hype online. But everything got kicked into high gear last week after Valve announced three new pieces of hardware: <a href="https://kotaku.com/16-cool-details-valve-new-steam-machine-console-controller-vr-headset-2000643572">The Steam Machine, Steam Frame, and Steam Controller</a>.</p>

 <h2><em>Half-Life 3</em> hype explodes</h2> <p>For many fans, already hungry for a new <em>Half-Life</em> game and convinced by dubious Reddit posts and TikToks that it was totally being announced soon, this hardware announcement from <a href="https://youtu.be/t1qwXTXVlXE">Valve was a very big deal.</a> Valve often releases new games with new hardware, like <em>Alyx</em> with the Index and <em>Desk Job</em> with the Steam Deck.</p>

 <p>So, naturally, many started to speculate that Valve’s next game, likely HLX aka <em>Half-Life 3,</em> would be announced soon and launched around the release of the new Steam Machine in 2026. <a href="https://kotaku.com/the-steam-machine-is-the-perfect-time-to-launch-half-life-3-2000644102">Heck, even I think that might be possible</a>. But then folks went into overdrive trying to predict the date <em>HLX</em> would be announced.</p>

 <p><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/HalfLife/comments/1oyt88p/summary_of_why_it_will_be_november_2025_and_most/">November 18 became a popular date for many</a>. It would mark the six-year anniversary of <a href="https://x.com/valvesoftware/status/1196566870360387584"><em>Half-Life: Alyx’</em>s announcement</a>, the last <em>Half-Life</em> game, and would give Valve plenty of time to market the sequel before an early 2026 launch. Others believe November 19 is the magical date, as it’s the 27-year anniversary of the original <em>Half-Life.&nbsp;</em></p>

 <p>People soon noticed that there’s a gap in sales events on Steam <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/steam-sale-dates/#:~:text=November%2010%20%E2%80%93%20November,15%3A%20Sports%20Fest">starting on November 18 and ending on December 8.</a> Some theorized that this was because Valve wanted a clear runway for <em>Half-Life 3</em>‘s reveal, though it seems unlikely that Valve would delay sales for a new game reveal.</p> <h2>More clues, more hype</h2> <p>Then fans noticed Geoff Keighley, the creator and host of the Game Awards and master of video game reveals, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/HalfLife/comments/1p02x4w/geoff_keighley_has_one_game_on_his_wishlist/">only had one game on his Steam wishlist</a>. When asked about it, he offered up some eye emojis. This threw people into a frenzy, despite the fact that <em>Half-Life 3</em> doesn’t have a Steam page, so it can’t be added to a wishlist yet. Didn’t matter; this was evidence <em>Half-Life 3</em> was going to be announced at Geoff’s annual trailer extravaganza, the Game Awards, in December.</p> <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">27 years ago today, Valve released HALF-LIFE, it's first game. <a href="https://t.co/9d13MAyAmB">pic.twitter.com/9d13MAyAmB</a></p> <p>— The Game Awards (@thegameawards) <a href="https://twitter.com/thegameawards/status/1991101144207085644?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 19, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <p><a href="https://x.com/thegameawards/status/1991101144207085644">The Game Awards tweeted about <em>Half-Life</em> on Wednesday</a>, noting the anniversary of the first game’s release. People freaked. But, as pointed out by<a href="https://x.com/Tyler_McV/status/1991160882202546235"> longtime Valve reporter and leaker Tyler McVicker</a>, the Game Awards account tweets this same anniversary every year. (And does it for <em>Half-Life 2,</em> as well.)</p>

 <p>But that didn’t matter either. At this point, people can’t ignore how many insiders, leakers, and reporters are hinting at some big announcement from Valve. Too many “clues” are being found by the community every day this week for fans to stop getting more and more excited. The hype levels are out of control. The hopium is off the charts.</p> <p>But keep in mind that, officially speaking, Valve has not announced that a new <em>Half-Life</em> game is in development. Still, Valve did reportedly have <a href="https://www.theverge.com/games/820533/valve-secrecy-security-guards-steam-machine-valve-hq-no-hl3">a lot of extra security at their offices</a> while revealing all the new Steam hardware. And the company does seem to have one more thing to announce, as its <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/publisher/valve/">official Steam page lists two upcoming games</a>, but only shows one, <em>Deadlock</em>. Is the other game <em>Half-Life 3</em>? The internet seems to think so.</p> <p>As a longtime <em>Half-Life</em> fan who has been waiting a long time for <em>Half-Life 3</em>, I’m inclined to believe, though I’d also advise everyone getting excited right now to remember that this could all lead to nothing. Expect nothing and you’ll be pleasantly surprised with whatever we get.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/samsung-40%E2%80%B3-full-hd-smart-tv-2025-looks-more-like-a-clearance-giveaway-than-a-real-sale.1358236/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><span>Entertainment upgrades don’t have to be expensive, especially with early Black Friday deals dropping in fast.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>If you’re after a modest-sized screen that still delivers on both visuals and sound, here’s some good news. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5695/">The 2025 model of Samsung’s 40-inch Full HD F6000 Smart TV is currently available on Amazon for just $148, thanks to a 25% discount</a>. It normally retails for close $200, so this deal is taking a good chunk off the price, making the upgrade much more affordable.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5695/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>
<p>You don’t have to worry about entering any weirdly long coupon codes or following some complicated checkout steps to score the discount. Just add the item to your cart, and the offer applies automatically. It’s also important to note that the retailer has listed it as a limited-time discount, which means it won’t be around for long. If you’ve been looking to treat yourself to a new screen, now is the time to make the move.</p>

<h2>Brilliant, Sharp Visuals for All Your Content</h2>
<p>This screen is not exactly big, which makes it ideal for smaller living rooms and even bedrooms. The sleek profile and slim bezels give it a minimal look while also keeping distractions at bay.</p>
<p>It pushes 1080p Full HD resolution for brighter, sharper visuals. Of course, it won’t rival a 4K screen, but it’s still fairly decent for everyday streaming. There’s High Dynamic Range (HDR) that actively expands the contrast between the lightest and darkest parts of a scene for better color accuracy, plus mega contrast, which automatically adjusts brightness and depth in real time. Watching a nature documentary or streaming your new favorite crime thriller, you’re going to enjoy an immersive viewing experience that pulls you in.</p>



<p>The Object Tracking Sound Lite feature helps the TV simulate directional audio to make it feel more dynamic. It’s pretty solid on its own, but you can always add a compatible Samsung soundbar to improve it even further.</p>
<p>The TV is also powered by Samsung’s One UI Tizen platform, which brings all your major streaming apps into one place. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5695/">You’re going to have instant access to over 2,700 free channels, including 400+ from Samsung TV Plus.</a> New content is also frequently added, so there’s always going to be something new to watch. Best of all, it also lets you cast your phone to the big screen to scroll, watch shows, and even take video calls.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/sonys-budget-headphones-slashed-an-extra-50-off-now-nearly-free-for-black-friday-on-amazon-2000645455</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/sony%E2%80%99s-budget-headphones-slashed-an-extra-50-off-now-nearly-free-for-black-friday-on-amazon.1358233/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Wireless headphones solve the tangled cable problem and keep your music private in shared spaces, but dropping $500 on AirPods Max makes zero sense when budget options deliver good daily performance. Most people need reliable Bluetooth audio for commutes and Zoom calls without the premium features that justify four-figure price tags.</p>
<p>Sony’s <strong>WH-CH520 headphones</strong> target practical users who want solid sound quality and marathon battery life without paying for luxury branding. Amazon has dropped<a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4594/"> these already-affordable headphones to $38 for Black Friday, down from their regular $69 price</a>, and creates an all-time low that makes impulse buying almost mandatory.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4594/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>50-Hour Battery Life</h2>
<p>The<strong> battery life of 50 hours</strong> means you do not face the constant anxiety associated with premium headphones which boast a capacity of between 20 to 30 hours. You can wear these every day on your commute through an entire workweek without thinking about finding power, then charge over the weekend for another five days of use. Road trips and festival weekends can happen sans charging cables or hunting for outlets between sessions.</p>
<p>The <strong>lightweight construction keeps pressure off your head</strong> during those extended wearing sessions that heavier headphones turn into endurance tests. Swivel ear cups rotate to lay flat in bags without taking up excessive space and the the folding design collapses the headphones into a compact form for travel. The adjustable headband accommodates various head sizes without the tight clamping force that causes headaches after an hour of wear.</p>



<p><strong>Sound quality is above expectation for budget-tier headphones</strong> with well-balanced audio that doesn’t artificially pump up the bass at the expense of mids and highs. The Sony app <strong>includes EQ customization to let you tailor frequency</strong> <strong>response</strong> to your taste or simply make up for any differences in your hearing. You can punch up the bass for hip-hop, emphasize vocals for podcasts, or flatten the curve for classical that sounds better reproduced neutrally. DSEE technology upscales compressed streaming audio, restoring detail that lossy formats discard during encoding.</p>



<p>The built-in microphone does its fair share for phone calls and voice commands, though it is not up to the audio quality of dedicated headsets designed primarily for communication. You can answer calls without pulling your phone from your pocket and keep conversations hands-free while walking or working. The microphone picks up your voice clearly in quiet environments, though noisy settings with traffic or crowds overwhelm the basic noise reduction and require you to speak louder.</p>
<p><strong>Bluetooth 5.2 connectivity maintains solid connections out to 30 feet</strong> in open spaces, serving typical home and office distances without dropouts. Walls and obstacles reduce effective range, but the headphones remain connected through normal room-to-room movement. Pairing is quick and easy through standard Bluetooth menus without any requirement for apps or complicated procedures; these headphones will work with <strong>Android, iOS, Windows, and any other device that supports Bluetooth</strong>.</p>
<p>At $38 for Sony wireless headphones with 50-hour battery life, you’re paying what knockoff brands charge for products that break within months. This 46% discount turns already reasonable headphones into the most cost-effective audio upgrade available this Black Friday.</p>

              <p>If you’ve already finished <a href="https://kotaku.com/ghost-tsushima-2-yotei-review-in-progress-open-world-2000628700"><em>Ghost Of Yōtei</em></a>, then crikey, please can I borrow some of your spare time? I’ve yet to finish&nbsp;<em>Ghost of Tsushima</em>, let alone even start <em>Yōtei</em>, despite a strong urge to slaughter my way through all that cherry blossom. But for those so far ahead, good news arrives November 24! The game is receiving a free update that’s adding a pretty detailed New Game+ option.</p> <p>At first glance, it appears to be a fairly traditional NG+, allowing you to start the game over once you’ve completed it, but this time with all the equipment and skills you picked up on the way. That comes with new difficulty levels that’ll let you boost the challenge to accompany your greater abilities (although c’mon, you know it’s fun to wait a bit before turning those on and just enjoy being ludicrously over-powered for a little while first), and a couple of new Trophies to earn.</p>

 <p>But it’s adding a whole bunch more than that. Weapons and armor sets are being given a new suite of upgrades to unlock, adding a bunch more motivation to play through again, alongside 30 new cosmetics and 10 new charms. It’s also adding a whole new in-world currency called Ghost Flowers, which are used to buy these new bits and bobs from a brand new merchant. There’s also a new feature added for the NG+ that’ll offer “stat tracking” as you replay the challenges. You can see a lot of this new stuff in brief glimpses in the trailer:</p>

  <p>Patch 1.100.000 will also come with a few new features for the main game, with a bunch of new doodads for the photo mode, including shutter speed and a composition grid, as well as more silly filters for…for…what <em>does</em> anyone do with these? There are also to be improvements to accessibility, with directional button remapping and other as-yet unrevealed changes. Plus, we assume, a bunch of bug fixes and the like.</p> <p>The co-op multiplayer mode <a href="https://kotaku.com/ghost-yotei-legends-multiplayer-trailer-release-date-2000618559"><em>Ghost Of Yōtei Legends</em></a> and its supernatural take on the events is still a fair ways off, with the ambiguous release date of “2026,” but when it arrives, it too will be free.</p>
