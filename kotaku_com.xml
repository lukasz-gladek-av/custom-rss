One of the most beloved and long-running games in the genre has been <em>Smite</em>, which is currently in its 11th year of service, so it only makes sense that its sequel has come along in the form of the aptly named <em>Smite 2</em>.</p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="195624" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="The Top 10 Most-Played Games On Steam Deck: August 2023 Edition" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="279" data-playlist="195624,196395,196049" data-current="195624"><div><p>The Top 10 Most-Played Games On Steam Deck: August 2023 Edition</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195624/195624_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195624/195624_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195624/195624_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195624/195624_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/21125.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>With <em>Smite 2</em> in Early Access, there’s a lot of work left to be done on the god-focused title, but that doesn’t mean the current build is missing everything we’ve come to expect in modern games. If you’re curious about popular features like crossplay and cross-progression in <em>Smite 2</em>, read on.</p><h2 id="h2861074"><a id="crossplay"></a>Does <em>Smite 2</em> have crossplay?</h2><p>The <em>Smite</em> community is rather large and spans various platforms, and the same can be said for <em>Smite 2</em>.

That’s reasonable, but you’ll want to be sure that your progression can carry over between versions.</p><p>Here’s some good news for you. <strong><em>Smite 2</em> does feature full cross-progression for every version</strong>.

This is nuts. Absolutely sicko behavior. Sony may have won the console war but there are clearly millions of degenerates within its ranks. The revelation comes from a recent interview with console interface designers at Sony and how player habits informed their choices when creating the new Welcome Hub. </p><p>“We had an internal hypothesis that far more people would put their console into rest mode than would fully shut it down each time between their play sessions,” Cory Gasaway, VP of Product, Game and Player Experiences at Sony Interactive Entertainment, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.gamefile.news/p/exclusive-ps5-welcome-hub-dashboard-cory-gasaway&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.gamefile.news/p/exclusive-ps5-welcome-hub-dashboard-cory-gasaway" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">told <em>Game File</em></a></span>. <strong>“</strong>As it turned out, it was actually about 50/50 between the two options between all our players. So, what that meant was for about 50 percent of our users, when they booted up, if they were in the U.S. they were landing on our ‘Explore’ page, and if they were outside the U.S. they were landing on the game page for the last game that they have played.”</p><p>For people like me who just put the console into rest mode, starting it up again puts you right back into whatever game was last being played. Others—roughly 32.5 million, to be exact—were landing on woefully boring home menu tabs. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/ps5-2024-year-review-concord-helldivers-astro-bot-price-1851724531?_gl=1*107oqcx*_ga*ODE3ODM5ODIyLjE3MjA0NjY0NTg.*_ga_V4QNJTT5L0*MTczNjE3MzU0NS42MS4xLjE3MzYxNzYwOTMuNjAuMC4w&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/ps5-2024-year-review-concord-helldivers-astro-bot-price-1851724531?_gl=1*107oqcx*_ga*ODE3ODM5ODIyLjE3MjA0NjY0NTg.*_ga_V4QNJTT5L0*MTczNjE3MzU0NS42MS4xLjE3MzYxNzYwOTMuNjAuMC4w">The Welcome Hub added last year fixed that</a></span> by adding a bunch of customizable widgets that immediately share cool info about things like console storage, DualSense battery life, and wishlist sales. </p><p>It’s all part of an ongoing effort within Sony to “have more shortcuts” in the console that “reduce the number of clicks” for players to get to what they need, as well as surfacing features and functionality they might not have been previously aware of.  Gasaway also told <em>Game File</em> that decoupling some of the user interface from system-level software updates has helped it speed up the number of tweaks and updates it pushes out every year. </p><p> Hiromi Wakai, vice president of product management at Sony Interactive Entertainment, also recently shared another interesting insight with <em>Game File</em> about PlayStation fans. It turns out the heaviest usage for the PlayStation Portal cloud gaming handheld comes at around 9:00 p.m. each day, about an hour after peak PS5 usage hits. “This could suggest scenarios like users playing on the console first, then later switching to PS Portal to play in another room—courtesy of PS Portal’s characteristics like the ability to play in another room—while their family is using the TV,” Wakai said.</p><p>The PS Portal has also been getting updates in response to the real-world usage data coming in.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://kotaku.com/pokemon-year-of-eevee-prismatic-evolutions-plush-1851732914<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Step aside Luigi, 2025 is now officially the Year of Eevee. That’s the rather bold claim made today on the official <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.pokemoncenter.com/en-gb/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.pokemoncenter.com/en-gb/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Pokémon Center UK website</a></span>, and likely to come to the <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.pokemoncenter.com/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.pokemoncenter.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">U.S. version later today</a></span>. What does it mean? Well, the TCG is about to launch a new special set of cards called Prismatic Evolutions, all themed around the lil’ brown pup and its octet of evolved forms, with new products released throughout the whole year, and there’s a bunch of new Eevee merch on the store, but could it also be...?</p><p>Rumors of a new Eevee evolution are an ever-present part of <em>Pokémon</em> fandom, with the wee creature not having gained a new mature form since Sylveon (Fairy type) arrived in 2014's Gen VI. Ten years is the longest Eevee’s ever gone without gaining another—the Normal-type Pokémon  began in 1996 being able to turn into Vaporeon (Water), Jolteon (Electric), and Flareon (Fire), then in 1999 gained Espeon (Psychic) and Umbreon (Dark), and then Leafeon (Grass) and Glaceon (Ice) in 2006's Gen IV.</p><p>While the card game has since dropped Fairy types, and never had Ice, the video games have a wealth of potential types that could receive an additional eeveelution. Most obvious, especially given they <em>are</em> in the TCG, are Fighting, Metal/Steel, and Dragon. If these decisions were to ignore the TCG (where it would adopt something close enough, like Glaceon defaulting to another Water type), then there’s still Poison, Ground, Rock, Bug, or Ghost. Which is all to say, there’s no reason not to do it!</p><p>However, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.pokebeach.com/2025/01/prismatic-evolutions-set-guide-full-card-list-secret-rares-cut-cards-products-and-more&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.pokebeach.com/2025/01/prismatic-evolutions-set-guide-full-card-list-secret-rares-cut-cards-products-and-more" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">we do already know the full card list from January 17's Prismatic Evolutions special set of the Pokémon TCG</a></span>, given it’s formed from two sources—55 percent of it is reprints from 2024 sets, and the remaining 45 percent comes from Japanese sets Terastal Festival ex and ex Starter Deck Generations. And none of them is a new Eeveelution.</p><p>The set is already providing incredibly popular. Pre-order stock is selling out everywhere, and my attempt to pick up my usual ETB from the Pokémon Center proved impossible—it was sold out literally the moment it appeared on the New Releases page. However, given the set is due to release new products for the entire year, it seems likely this over-excitement will eventually wane.</p><p>What you <em>can</em> buy right now in the UK, and likely later today in the U.S., are a bunch of cute Eevee plushes. Of these, eight are brand new, added to the latest sub-category that’s confusingly not “Sitting Cuties,” rather called “Poké Doll.” There’s an Eevee, and one of each eeveelution (except Flareon?!), and they’re <em>super-</em>cute. Please, someone, stop me from doing something silly. (Also, Flareon? You OK?)</p><p>I’ve made a little gallery of them all, so click next to see all those.</p><p>In the meantime, let’s all wildly over-speculate that this very obvious marketing idea, with its own logo, is actually the beginning of a spectacular announcement of a Dragon-type Eevee to be revealed in this year’s <em>Pokémon Legends: Z-A</em>. Zulteon. Imagine if I got that right.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
