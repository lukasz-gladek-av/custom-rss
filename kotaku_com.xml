But this year, the team just put out another game, <em>Dragon Age: The Veilguard</em> and doesn’t want to steal the game’s thunder with a bunch of teases for a game that’s still a ways out.

If you’ve finished Harding’s mission, “The Singing Blade,” you’ll find a chest next to the Workshop. Inside are two armor appearances called Specter of Battles Past and Paragon of Leadership as well as a helmet called Command Helmet. These aren’t armor sets with new stats, but instead are appearances you can set to wear in Rook’s room while maintaining the defense and effects of other armor sets. The Specter of Battles Past includes the recognizable red stripe down the sleeve that any <em>Mass Effect </em>fan would recognize as an homage to Commander Shepard’s armor in the original trilogy.
