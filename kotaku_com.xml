              <p>People online seem tired of <a href="https://kotaku.com/battlefield-6-crossover-skins-rick-morty-call-of-duty-1851786919">crossover skins and silly cosmetics</a> in games like <em>Call of Duty </em>and <em>Battlefield.</em> And now one of the lead devs behind online shooter <em>Arc Raiders</em> has promised that you won’t see Santa Claus or dinosaur outfits in the newly released live-service game.</p> <p>The latest big hit on Steam is multiplayer extraction shooter <a href="https://kotaku.com/arc-raiders-embark-extraction-virgil-watkins-interview-2000639879"><em>Arc Raiders</em></a>. It launched on October 30 on consoles and PC and <a href="https://kotaku.com/arc-raiders-steam-ai-server-connection-error-launch-2000640110">quickly racked up over 200k concurrent players on Steam</a>. And being an online game in 2025 means offering up cosmetics for players to earn or purchase. <em>Arc Raiders</em> is no exception, selling players skins if they so desire. But this year has also marked a turning point online in regard to in-game cosmetics. Players seem less willing to put up with silly crossover skins and goofy cosmetics. This has led to a whole ongoing skin saga involving <em>Battlefield 6</em>, <a href="https://kotaku.com/battlefield-6-goofy-skins-call-of-duty-nicki-minaj-2000614447">which has promised not to include those kinds of items</a>, and <em><a href="https://kotaku.com/call-of-duty-skins-black-ops-7-blops-6-carry-over-battlefield-6-2000620379">Call of Duty: Black Ops 7</a>,</em> which arguably <a href="https://kotaku.com/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-bad-bf6-battlefield-6-hype-trailer-2000618912">started the backlash</a> we are seeing and has backpedaled on allowing silly skins from <em>BLOPS6</em> to move forward into the upcoming FPS. And now the design director for <em>Arc Raiders</em> has weighed in on the topic and claimed the team is “protective” of the shooter’s visual identity.</p>

 <p>“What I believe to be true is that we will maintain the current aesthetic that we have,” <a href="https://www.pcgamesn.com/arc-raiders/skins-cosmetics-interview"><em>Arc Raiders</em> design director Virgil Watkins told <em>PCgamesN</em></a> when asked about silly skins. “[Cosmetics] will fit within our sensibilities of how these things look and fit within the world and inside the fiction.” And while the devs and artists at Embark want to provide players with “as much freedom as possible” to express themselves, there are limits.</p>

 <p>“I think it was said a little while ago in a meeting [that] we would never, say, make a Santa Claus outfit,” explained Watkins.</p> <p>“But we may make something that is of our own tone and our own aesthetic that evokes Santa Claus. That’s not even a statement that we will have a Santa Claus outfit, but I think that’s kind of the line you can draw. We’re pretty protective of making sure that anything that goes into the game fits within the visual identity, fits within the tone, fits within the setting. I think because so much of our game is strong around that element, it would be really unfortunate to upset that by injecting, I don’t know, a T-Rex costume running around suddenly – I don’t think the novelty is worth the trade.”</p>

  <p>Watkins’ answer highlights the problem of trying to walk the line between not disrupting your game’s visual identity while also still offering skins people are willing to buy. This is a problem <a href="https://kotaku.com/battlefield-6-season-one-small-map-battle-royale-reactions-negative-review-ea-2000639948"><em>Battlefield 6</em> is facing right now as it enters its first season.</a> While many of the skins added to the game in the recent update look pretty realistic to me, many other players online are furious about all the colors. One skin even had its neon green toned down after players complained enough. While that might be seen as a victory for some, it leads to a strange situation where other players might not want to buy the game’s battle pass or spend money on new skins because they’re too boring or plain.</p> <p>Threading that needle is proving tricky for EA, will likely be challenging for <em>Black Ops 7</em>, and I suspect it will be a problem for<em> Arc Raiders,</em> too. <a href="https://kotaku.com/new-battlefield-6-skin-is-causing-community-meltdown-grounded-ea-2000638294">All it takes is one skin to be a bit too silly</a> or colorful, and suddenly, the community might turn on you and use your own words against you. Good luck to all devs working on live-service games in 2025. It sounds like a nightmare.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><span>Did you know that several of the </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-legends-z-a-mega-evolution-list-new-all-switch-2000621380"><span>Mega Evolutions in </span><i><span>Pokémon</span></i></a> <span>have some element of the letters “X” or “Y” in their designs? It’s true! While they don’t literally look like the letters in most cases, some aspects of their designs resemble the names of the 3DS </span><i><span>Pokémon </span></i><span>games they originally debuted in back in 2013. When one </span><i><span>Pokémon </span></i><span>pixel artist and commentator called TAHK0 pointed this out on </span><a href="https://x.com/TAHK0/status/1892649080213422279"><span>X</span></a><span>, he was bombarded with hateful responses. Where some people would retreat and try to ignore the harassment, TAHK0 instead made a two-and-a-half-hour-long video breaking down how almost every one of these superpowered transformations has some part of their design that is based on “X” and “Y.” If that’s not commitment, then I don’t know what is.</span></p> <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">it has been over 15 years and pokemon fans and fakemon artists have yet to catch on that pretty much all mega pokemon up to this point have been shaped like an x or a y</p> <p>will this continue to go unnoticed when new mega pokemon start becoming z shaped stay tuned</p> <p>— TAHK0 ☕️ (@TAHK0) <a href="https://twitter.com/TAHK0/status/1892649080213422279?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">February 20, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <p><span>In an interview with </span><i><span>Kotaku</span></i><span>, TAHK0 says he didn’t expect this observation to be as controversial as it was, and that by the time he realized people were mad about it, he’d already spent some time joking with detractors.</span></p>

 <p><span>“It was just like any other throwaway half-joking over-exaggerated tweet I wrote after waking up, and I only realized things were going wrong after about an hour afterward when things started taking off,” he says. “I had thought after pointing it out, it would be clear to everyone, so I was originally replying with jokey answers since I thought they’d be in on it like an upside-down Mega Camerupt— But everyone was taking it very seriously and were very angry. That’s when I knew it was out of control.”</span></p> <div> <p>Welcome to Exp. Share, <em>Kotaku</em> ’s <em>Pokémon</em> column in which we dive deep to explore notable characters, urban legends, communities, and just plain weird quirks from throughout the <em>Pokémon</em> franchise.</p></div> <p><span>Several of the arguments, as TAHK0 points out in his video, seem to be rooted in the assumption that this design motif means that Pokémon must literally be shaped like an X or Y–think a letter puppet from </span><i><span>Sesame Street</span></i><span>–while others pointed to specific images of the Pokémon</span> <span>in question in which this quality is de-emphasized in an effort to “debunk” the theory, rather than looking at the Pokemon’s design as a whole. But TAHK0 is correct. Sometimes it’s best seen when viewing a Pokémon from the front, rather than the side as some artwork depicts them. In the video, TAHK0 points to the </span><a href="https://creativerevolution.io/aphantasia-a-blind-minds-eye/"><span>Aphantasia Test</span></a><span>, which illustrates how people’s abilities to imagine objects in their mind vary, and for some, looking at a piece of art which, out of necessity, depicts an object (or, in this case, a Pokémon) from a particular angle can make it difficult to envision how it looks from all angles, resulting in some of the disagreements people have had with this theory online. The key to a complete takedown is anticipating all the bad-faith arguments someone is going to make, as well as the honest misunderstandings some may have, and as someone who has less patience than he used to for people willfully misinterpreting the things I say, I gotta hand it to TAHK0 for addressing just about every argument in good spirits.</span></p>

 <p><span>The video goes through all the Mega Evolutions that were revealed prior to </span><i><span>Legends: Z-A</span></i><span>’s launch, and also breaks down lore elements like how Mega Evolution originates from </span><i><span>X </span></i><span>and </span><i><span>Y</span></i><span> mascots Xerneas and Yveltal, who are distinctly and intentionally shaped like their respective letters. Some monsters, like Metagross with its four arms or Absol with the wings on its back, are very obviously shaped like an X or Y, while others, like Sableye, have a hidden element of their character design that references letters. Watching the video was fascinating for me, as someone who was largely willing to buy the theory, but hadn’t stopped to look at every Mega Evolution to verify. Some I hadn’t even considered caught me off guard.&nbsp;</span></p>

  <p><span>TAHK0 says he felt “discouraged” after the initial pushback, but as new Megas from the then-unreleased </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-legends-za-review-switch-2-bugs-performance-2000637719"><i><span>Pokémon Legends: Z-A</span></i></a><span> were revealed, like Mega Dragonite and Mega Malamar, which both have pretty noticeable Y silhouettes, he felt more emboldened that it wasn’t all, as some detractors said, a “giant coincidence.”</span></p>

 <p><span>“After the tweet left my audience, I remember addressing most arguments pretty early on, but it got such a viral reaction that I couldn’t keep up with answering everyone, and not everyone would see my responses to others, so then their responses started being about how I wasn’t responding to anything,” he says. “My own initial jokes were being taken seriously, so being light-hearted wasn’t the play, and any disagreement on my part was taken as me having my head up my own butt. So responding to every possible argument I could, while being light-hearted to make sure this time it was clear it’s not that serious, seemed like the only way I could ‘get out alive,’ so to speak. People were originally way more quick to believe a confident argument against me than anything I could respond with, which unfortunately is how the internet has worked for a long time now.”</span></p>

 <p><span>While TAHK0 was working on his feature-length response for his YouTube channel, perhaps the biggest piece of evidence in the Pokedex was revealed: Mega Raichu X and Y. These long-overdue Mega forms for the final stage of Pikachu’s evolutionary line are set to join </span><i><span>Legends: Z-A </span></i><span>in the RPG’s </span><i><span>Mega Dimension </span></i><span>DLC, and their very obvious “X” and “Y” silhouettes have essentially been the silver bullet for the whole discussion, and TAHK0 notes that the onslaught of jokes at his expense on unrelated posts and content have “vanished” overnight.</span></p>

  <p><span>“When Mega Raichu X and Y were announced, I remember being so excited while simultaneously so relieved with how obvious and clear they made [the X and Y shapes],” TAHK0 says. “If you go back and watch my reaction, I actually couldn’t form a sentence. It was a lot all at once after dealing with a not-so-good time for eight months. Also, Pikachu is my favorite Pokémon, so it was pretty fitting.”</span></p> <p><span>TAHK0 says his breakdown of every individual Mega Evolution has changed some minds, and that he sometimes gets a nice comment from randos saying they’re now “a believer.” Now that </span><i><span>Legends: Z-A</span></i><span> is out and brought with it several new Mega Evolutions, it looks like Game Freak isn’t holding as tightly to the design motif, though Dragonite, Raichu, and others do keep that spirit alive. The game even goes out of its way to show that Mega Zygarde, one of the last Mega forms the player receives in </span><i><span>Legends: Z-A</span></i><span>, has a distinct X, Y, and Z on the cannon it holds after it transforms. So if </span><i><span>X</span></i><span> and </span><i><span>Y </span></i><span>set the stage for this design motif, </span><i><span>Legends: Z-A</span></i><span> is driving it home. Will these obvious examples be enough for those who are still digging their heels into the ground over it? Maybe not. But in the meantime, TAHK0 says he’s open to “non-threatening” discussion and disagreements. Especially with at least a few more Mega Evolutions still on the way when </span><i><span>Mega Dimension </span></i><span>launches.</span></p> <p><span>“Obviously, now I would prefer they stick to the letter theming, but I’m pretty indifferent,” he says. “I’m a big fan of creator’s intent, so [new Megas] could be whatever-themed and I would still be excited. Learning about their design and lore decisions is the fun part for me.”</span></p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/retro-games-are-coming-to-animal-crossing-new-horizons-but-you-have-to-pay-to-play-them.1339762/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Nintendo randomly announced a ton of new content coming <a href="https://kotaku.com/animal-crossing-new-horizons-switch-2-edition-update-free-2000640118">to <em>Animal Crossing: New Horizons</em> in a couple of months</a>. That includes new Nintendo crossover items you can purchase from Nook’s Cranny. These will apparently let you play some classic games like <em>Ice Climber</em>. It’s a neat nod to one of the coolest parts of the 2002 <em>Animal Crossing</em> on GameCube, except that this time around it’ll require a paid subscription to access. Boo!</p> <p>It was a neat surprise going about your business in <em>Animal Crossing</em> and randomly discovering a game like<em> Excitebike</em> for the NES. No, it wasn’t just for decoration. You could actually activate it and play Shigeru Miyamoto’s original 1984 racer <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=gamecube+animal+crossing+emulator+kotaku&amp;rlz=1C1ONGR_enUS1089US1089&amp;oq=gamecube+animal+crossing+emulator+kotaku&amp;gs_lcrp=EgZjaHJvbWUyBggAEEUYOTIHCAEQABiABDIICAIQABgWGB4yCAgDEAAYFhgeMggIBBAAGBYYHjIICAUQABgWGB4yCAgGEAAYFhgeMgoIBxAAGAoYFhgeMggICBAAGBYYHjIICAkQABgWGB7SAQg1OTk2ajBqNKgCALACAA&amp;sourceid=chrome&amp;ie=UTF-8">via a fully-functioning in-game NES emulator</a>. A bunch of other classics were available to collect as well. Some, like <em>Punch-Out!!!</em>, were only available through special codes. Others, like <em>Ice Climber</em>, required special e-reader cards.</p>

 <p>Imagine winning a random raffle or shaking a tree and being blessed with a free copy of the original <em>Donkey Kong.</em>&nbsp;Back in 2002 there was both the novelty of playing one game within another game and the appetite for older games that weren’t otherwise backwards compatible on modern hardware. Maybe your mom buried the NES up in the attic or sold it to help buy the SNES. Maybe <em>Balloon Fight</em> got lost when the kid down the street never gave it back.</p>

 <p>I booted up <em>Animal Crossing</em> so many times&nbsp;<em>just</em> to go back and play <em>Punch-Out!!</em>, which even at the time felt strangely nostalgic (and also a pain on the GameCube controller).</p> <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">We can see the playable Super NES and Super Famicom games will be F-Zero and Panel de Pon, respectively <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/AnimalCrossing?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#AnimalCrossing</a> <a href="https://t.co/mpmH0wQjsL">https://t.co/mpmH0wQjsL</a> <a href="https://t.co/vGBmTDbKcR">pic.twitter.com/vGBmTDbKcR</a></p> <p>— André (@AndreSegers) <a href="https://twitter.com/AndreSegers/status/1983926022752874971?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 30, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <p>So it’s a rad idea to bring that feature back for <em>Animal Crossing: New Horizons</em>, but a huge bummer that these games will only work with Switch Online where…you’ve already been able to go and play them for years. It doesn’t even sound like the full suite of NES classics will be injected into <em>Animal Crossing</em> when its free update arrives on January 15.</p>

 <p>Nintendo stresses you’ll only be able to play a “select classic game on each system,” and for the purposes of the trailer at least, it only confirms Famicom, NES, and Game Boy furniture pieces. So you’ll have access to the handheld version of <em>Dr. Mario</em>, but no word on if something like <em>Super Metroid</em> will be available with a possible SNES your Villager can buy from the Nook kids (some eagle-eyed fans <a href="https://x.com/AndreSegers/status/1983926022752874971">have spotted <em>F-Zero</em></a> in one brief moment from the trailer).</p> <p>Why not just make these games free for people who own <em>New Horizons</em>? I have no idea. Got to protect the value proposition of titles that came out over three decades ago and which Nintendo has sold multiple times before across half a dozen different platforms, I guess. Here’s to whichever poor kid accidentally buys <em>Ice Climber</em> in <em>Animal Crossing: New Horizons</em> next year and gets instructed to input their parents’ credit card information when they try to play it without a subscription.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Friday Night Lights Creator Is Making The Call Of Duty Movie]]></title>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Activision has officially announced its plans to make a <em>Call of Duty</em> movie. It will be written and directed by<em> Friday Night Lights</em> creator Peter Berg with some writing help from <em>Yellowstone’s</em> creator Taylor Sheridan. No release date was shared.</p> <p>On October 30, <a href="https://deadline.com/2025/10/taylor-sheridan-peter-berg-call-of-duty-movie-1236602997/">following an initial report from <em>Deadline</em></a>, Paramount and Activision confirmed that after signing a deal in <a href="https://kotaku.com/call-of-duty-movie-paramount-activision-2000622362">September to work together</a> on a future <em>Call of Duty</em> movie, the companies have settled on a director for the live-action war movie based on the popular first-person shooter franchise. Peter Berg is directing, writing, and producing the <em>Call of Duty</em> movie through his studio Film 47. Berg’s past work includes films like <i>Lone Survivor</i>,&nbsp;<i>Deepwater Horizon</i>, and&nbsp;<i>Patriots Day.&nbsp;</i>Taylor Sheridan is co-writing the movie and will help produce it. In recent years, Sheridan has become one of the biggest names in TV, creating shows like <em>Yellowstone</em>, <em>Mayor of Kingstown</em>, and <em>Tulsa King</em> for Paramount’s streaming platform.</p>

 <p>No plot details were shared in a press release announcing the<em> Call of Duty</em> movie’s director and writers, but Paramount did claim that the live-action film will be “designed to thrill its massive global fan base by delivering on the hallmarks of what fans love about the iconic series, while boldly expanding the franchise to entirely new audiences.” In other words, Paramount claims its new <em>Call of Duty</em> movie will be good and everyone will love it.</p> <p>Paramount likely sees Berg as a perfect fit for this project, as he has a history of making gritty action and war movies. And teaming him up with Sheridan makes sense as the two are friends in real life and have worked together before on movies like <em>Hell or High Water.&nbsp;</em>No casting announcements were made by Paramount, but considering Berg has used Mark Wahlberg in five different movies, it seems at least quite possible that the actor (who previously portrayed Max Payne) will be involved in the upcoming <em>Call of Duty</em> movie. Well, assuming it gets made. Activision has been trying and failing for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Call_of_Duty#Films">a decade now to make a <em>CoD</em> movie</a>. But maybe this time…</p>
