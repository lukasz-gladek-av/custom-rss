On December 25, however, they returned to X (formerly know as Twitter) to do exactly that. “This holiday season, I couldn’t resist sharing this gift with you all,” they <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://x.com/NextHandheld/status/1871936689721209331&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://x.com/NextHandheld/status/1871936689721209331" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">posted</a></span>. “Some might call it an early reveal… but I call it the best-kept secret of the year.” The message was accompanied by a photo showing a hand holding an alleged Switch 2 sideways in what looked like a hardware testing workroom. </p><p>The ravenous Switch 2 leak community immediately honed in on weird artifacting and mismatching in the image to accuse it of being an AI-generated fake. NextHandheld later followed up with a second post sharing an alleged image of the Switch 2 dock, cheekily writing, “It’s all just AI generated.” There were once again weird anomalies in the background and the outline of the console. Looking more closely at the images shared, believers speculated that the breaks were too clean to be AI-generated and instead indicated that, likely to protect their identity and the location where the photos were taken, NextHandheld had simply used AI to replace everything in the images <em>but</em> the hardware itself.</p><p>One user on the Switch 2 subreddit, DoctorHoneywell, compared various contours and dimensions from a previous alleged Joy-Con leak and found the photos from NextHandheld were a very close match, possibly indicating that both were in fact from a production unit approximating the final build design and shape. “It could be a really high quality resin 3D print with a well done finish, and then custom stickers on it. It could be really good photoshop job over an AI image,” DoctorHoneywell concluded. “But that would mean that I was still right with what I have said every single time I’ve been asked about this before they came out: It’s either real, or a high quality fake.”</p><p>The debate waged throughout Christmas Day, and NextHandheld’s own poll shared on X had 60 percent of roughly 4,000 respondents believing the leaks were legit and the rest thinking they were elaborate fakes. The mysterious leaker is also promising to reveal new details in the days ahead. Other once-prominent Nintendo leakers <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/nintendo-direct-leaks-youtube-pyoro-switch-2-1851563772?_gl=1*1ff5vse*_ga*MzQzNjkwNDM2LjE2NDY2NjQ1NzQ.*_ga_V4QNJTT5L0*MTczNTI0MTk1MS4xODEuMS4xNzM1MjQ2NDA2LjM4LjAuMA..&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/nintendo-direct-leaks-youtube-pyoro-switch-2-1851563772?_gl=1*1ff5vse*_ga*MzQzNjkwNDM2LjE2NDY2NjQ1NzQ.*_ga_V4QNJTT5L0*MTczNTI0MTk1MS4xODEuMS4xNzM1MjQ2NDA2LjM4LjAuMA..">like Pyoro, who previously confessed</a></span> to having a source with access to Nintendo’s website backend, have also tried to get in on the action, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/GamingLeaksAndRumours/comments/1hirp76/necrolipe_reportedly_says_that_pyoro_liked_the/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GamingLeaksAndRumours/comments/1hirp76/necrolipe_reportedly_says_that_pyoro_liked_the/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">but without sharing anything definitive</a></span>. For some, the entire thing is reminiscent of the notorious 2018 “Grinch leak” about <em>Super Smash Bros. Ultimate</em>’s roster. That one turned out to be a carefully crafted scam. Is NextHandheld pulling a similar trick?</p><p>The stakes around these leaks remain quite low. Unless everything that has so far trickled out has been completely made-up and off-base, all available rumors and reporting point to Nintendo’s next console likely being pretty similar to the existing Switch, just with upgraded specs. Every time it feels like speculation around the Switch 2 might be dying down again, a new data point arises for fans to argue about, and it seems likely that will keep happening until Nintendo finally reveals official information. The company’s promised to do so by April 2025, and the time for its big traditional February Direct is quickly approaching.</p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

The narrative-focused RPG chronicling the struggle of misfit adventurers on a quest to save the world held my attention like little else. Its slow-burn story told through text boxes on pre-rendered backgrounds, all backed by a soaring melodic score, was unlike any piece of media I encountered before. Before the decade was up, <em>Final Fantasy VIII</em> arrived and delivered more of the same for me. In the early 2000s, however, <em>Final Fantasy </em>changed, and I thought I’d never experience <em>that</em> kind of game for the first time again. That is, until I fired up <em>Fantasian Neo Dimension</em> and was instantly transported back to the late ‘90s. </p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="195519" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="I Didn’t Play Final Fantasy XVI ‘Right,’ And That’s OK" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="148" data-playlist="195519,195905,196805" data-current="195519"><div><p>I Didn’t Play Final Fantasy XVI ‘Right,’ And That’s OK</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195519/195519_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195519/195519_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195519/195519_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195519/195519_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/21013.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p><strong>Read More:</strong> <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/final-fantasy-7-ff7-review-1997-worth-playing-1851411735&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/final-fantasy-7-ff7-review-1997-worth-playing-1851411735"><em>Final Fantasy VII: </em>The <em>Kotaku</em> Retro Review</a></span></p><p>And if you’re like me and have been craving those original PlayStation <em>Final Fantasy</em> vibes, then you absolutely need to give <em>Fantasian</em> a spin.</p><figure id="" data-id="e38418917088e72b365c642dec8a38ad" data-recommend-id="image://e38418917088e72b365c642dec8a38ad" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Leo stands on the bridge of a ship." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Leo stands on the bridge of a ship." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Mistwalker / Claire Jackson / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="e38418917088e72b365c642dec8a38ad" data-recommend-id="image://e38418917088e72b365c642dec8a38ad" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Leo stands on the bridge of a ship." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>If you’re only now hearing about <em>Fantasian</em>, there’s probably a good reason for that. Developed by Mistwalker and produced by the father of <em>Final Fantasy</em>, Hironobu Sakaguchi, <em>Fantasian</em> was originally locked behind Apple Arcade’s iOS and Mac ecosystem when it launched in April of 2021. Like <em>Final Fantasy </em>titles of the late ‘90s on the original PlayStation, it features a fixed camera perspective and 3D character models animated over pre-made backgrounds. It also features a soundtrack written by legendary <em>Final Fantasy</em> composer Nobuo Uematsu. Three years after its initial release, <em>Fantasian </em>arrives on modern consoles and PC via <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/how-long-is-fantasian-neo-dimension-1851712603?rev=1735243042840&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/how-long-is-fantasian-neo-dimension-1851712603?rev=1735243042840"><em>Neo Dimension</em></a></span>, an updated version with spruced-up graphics, difficulty adjustments, some tweaks to the gameplay to adapt its mobile origins, and voice acting. </p><p><strong>Read More:</strong> <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/how-long-is-fantasian-neo-dimension-1851712603?rev=1735243042840&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/how-long-is-fantasian-neo-dimension-1851712603?rev=1735243042840">How Long Is <em>Fantasian Neo Dimension</em>?</a></span></p><p>While <em>Fantasian</em> is a video game produced in the 21st century for mobile platforms, it is eerily capable of transporting you back to the simpler times of <em>Final Fantasy 7</em>, <em>8</em>, and <em>9</em>. This is especially the case if you mute the new voice acting and just let the text boxes do the dialogue and exposition for you (which, with all due respect to the voice talent that went into bringing the characters to life, I think is the better way to play <em>Fantasian</em>).</p><figure id="" data-id="7a75d88f3226fb23313ada3bd7643ee2" data-recommend-id="image://7a75d88f3226fb23313ada3bd7643ee2" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Leo, Kina, and Cheryl battle a Mechteria monster." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Leo, Kina, and Cheryl battle a Mechteria monster." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Mistwalker / Claire Jackson / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="7a75d88f3226fb23313ada3bd7643ee2" data-recommend-id="image://7a75d88f3226fb23313ada3bd7643ee2" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Leo, Kina, and Cheryl battle a Mechteria monster." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Unlike <em>FF</em> titles of the late ‘90s, however, the backgrounds in <em>Fantasian </em>weren’t created with computer graphics, but instead were produced with <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/JRPG/comments/1h46qqt/fantasian_neo_dimension_handmade_diorama/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/JRPG/comments/1h46qqt/fantasian_neo_dimension_handmade_diorama/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">actual physical dioramas</a></span> that were photographed from multiple angles. Though it gives a distinct, and <em>gorgeous</em>, look to <em>Fantasian</em>, the experience in motion is very similar to old-school <em>FF </em>titles. <em>FF7 </em>in particular always had a hand-crafted look to its backgrounds that contributed to its charm. The world feels intentional, with an eye toward making it feel like a memorable place, inspirationally crafted to transport you to a fantasy realm. Toss in some turn-based combat, random encounters, and a hybrid fantasy/science-fiction narrative about an amnesiac protagonist and, well, if you were a <em>Final Fantasy</em> fan in the late ‘90s, this should all sound very familiar. And speaking of sound, oh boy, will <em>Fantasian</em> <em>sound</em> familiar. Just listen to this battle theme:</p><p>And compare it to the melodies in this classic <em>FF</em> jam:</p><p>The soundtrack is filled with moments like this, stirring up our memories of the epic adventures of yesteryear through melodies and motifs that sound familiar to ‘90s-era <em>Final Fantasy</em> tunes or just through Uematsu’s signature melodic and compositional styles. It’s some of his finest work. </p><p>As someone who always felt that a certain charm was lost when <em>Final Fantasy</em> started changing its overall structure in the early 2000s with <em>Final Fantasy X</em>, <em>Fantasian</em> has successfully filled several late evenings for me with a kind of wild neo-nostalgia that I’ve always wanted to experience, but have never expected from modern games. In its presentation and narrative, <em>Fantasian</em> literally feels like a hidden PSX <em>FF</em> title. </p><figure id="" data-id="2f3bdede555862b6f4b11c6a06fe5742" data-recommend-id="image://2f3bdede555862b6f4b11c6a06fe5742" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Cheryl stands in the wreckage of the Machine Realm." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Cheryl stands in the wreckage of the Machine Realm." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Mistwalker / Claire Jackson / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="2f3bdede555862b6f4b11c6a06fe5742" data-recommend-id="image://2f3bdede555862b6f4b11c6a06fe5742" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Cheryl stands in the wreckage of the Machine Realm." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>There are a few rough edges here and there, and you can sense the mobile origins of the game from time to time via the UI and the fact that the combat wants you to line up targets in a row in a way that would probably feel more natural on a touch screen. And while the story is perfectly entertaining, it’s not hitting the way <em>FF7</em>’s or <em>FF8</em>’s does. (Then again, it also has to compete with the two decades of nostalgia I’ve built up for Cloud and Squall’s tales.)</p><p>But really, those rough spots matter very little as the game nails the overall pacing and tone of storytelling and dialogue that brought late-‘90s <em>Final Fantasy</em> titles to life. I’ve yet to hit the game’s infamous “Part Two,” which I’ve heard comes with a wild difficulty spike (and I’m playing on “Hard” difficulty), but I’ve been spending evenings grinding out my characters in preparation for that…which, honestly, is what I used to do in <em>Final Fantasy 7</em> anyway.</p><figure id="" data-id="b7a280c56f0fc8ca005720f3061b2dd3" data-recommend-id="image://b7a280c56f0fc8ca005720f3061b2dd3" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Leo stands in a town in the mountains." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Leo stands in a town in the mountains." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Mistwalker / Claire Jackson / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="b7a280c56f0fc8ca005720f3061b2dd3" data-recommend-id="image://b7a280c56f0fc8ca005720f3061b2dd3" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Leo stands in a town in the mountains." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p><em>Fantasian</em> is shaping up to be one of my favorite games of 2024, even though it’s a psuedo-remaster of a 2021 title. It is the kind of game I’ve been aching to play for nearly 25 years. If you’ve been glancing at screenshots since the game’s original release a few years ago, admiring the dioramas and wondering if it could cast the same spell as those late ‘90s PSX <em>Final Fantasy</em> titles, then wonder no more and give <em>Neo Dimension</em> a try.</p><p>.<br></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

After season one ended with Gi-hun (Lee Jung-jae), also known as Player 456,  choosing to search for the people behind the game instead of boarding a flight to Los Angeles to reconnect with his daughter, we catch up with him two years later as he’s contracted a group of people to search for The Salesman (Gong Yoo), the man who recruits people into the game. The formerly naive Gi-hun is now a radicalized vigilante with a makeshift shooting range and illegal guns in his hotel room. But, that’s not the only change this season. </p><p>Over seven episodes, <em>Squid Game</em> introduces its first transgender character, shows us someone being recruited to be a guard, and turns more children’s games into chaos creators. It’s not all good, as some of the second season’s changes left us yearning for more. But one thing is for sure: these changes make it abundantly clear that we are entering the final episodes of <em>Squid Game</em> as a series. Let’s cherish them while we can.</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="fa2a16f2361db10f4303770ed7689ba7" data-recommend-id="image://fa2a16f2361db10f4303770ed7689ba7" data-format="png" data-width="1535" data-height="1038" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Two men about to play Russian Roulette" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Two men about to play Russian Roulette" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Netflix</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="fa2a16f2361db10f4303770ed7689ba7" data-recommend-id="image://fa2a16f2361db10f4303770ed7689ba7" data-format="png" data-width="1535" data-height="1038" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Two men about to play Russian Roulette" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>The central tension of the show has always been rooted in the deadly consequences of playing the show’s twisted versions of children’s games. In the past, <em>Squid Game </em>has turned Red Light, Green Light into a massacre machine, throwing marbles into a breeding ground for lethal deception, and literally put lives in people’s hands with Tug of War. The new season gives still more traditionally harmless games a murderous twist.</p><p>Before the season gets to the island for the start of the competition, the Salesman merges double-handed Rock, Paper, Scissors with Russian Roulette. After capturing Woo-seok (June Suk-ho) and Mr. Kim (Oh Dal-su), two of the men tasked by Gi-hun to find him, he forces them to each throw out a choice in Rock, Paper, Scissors with each of their hands before taking one choice back and determining the winner based on the final selections. The loser got a gunshot to the temple, with the chance that the hammer could come down on an empty chamber. As we saw, the split-second nature of having to observe what your opponent played and choosing which of your hands to take back led to Mr. Kim acting on instinct alone, instincts that convinced him to spare his younger flunky. </p><p>Later, the season introduced a six-legged pentathlon in which six contestants each tie one of their legs to another’s while moving through a course that has them playing five games—Ddakji, Flying Stone, Gongi, Spinning Top, and Jegi. Outside of Ddakji, the other four were all new additions. But none of those produced heart-wrenching results like the final new game introduced in the second season: Mingle.</p><p>In Mingle, contestants stand on a spinning platform surrounded by a number of open rooms. When the platform stops spinning, the announcer speaks out the number of people that must be grouped together and in one of the rooms by the time the timer stops. Anyone left out of a room when the timer is out gets shot dead, along with contestants in a room with the incorrect number of (alive) players. Alliances are formed and broken within minutes, depending on what is asked of them to survive, and the mad dash to doors turns into contestants physically trying to keep others out of their rooms, effectively killing them. This was the first game of the season that made it abundantly clear to the contestants that teamwork is a survivalist illusion, and saving yourself ultimately will come down to killing others.</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="241b4a62e61865bf19eb65f91ef3c47b" data-recommend-id="image://241b4a62e61865bf19eb65f91ef3c47b" data-format="jpg" data-width="2808" data-height="1872" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Contestants choosing sides" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Contestants choosing sides" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Netflix</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="241b4a62e61865bf19eb65f91ef3c47b" data-recommend-id="image://241b4a62e61865bf19eb65f91ef3c47b" data-format="jpg" data-width="2808" data-height="1872" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Contestants choosing sides" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>Following the death of game creator Oh Il-nam (O Yeong-su) at the end of Season 1, it looks like the head of the games In-ho (Lee Byung-hun) took what he learned from last season and expanded it. In the first season, contestants were only given one opportunity to vote on whether the games should continue or stop without any compensation. While the majority voted for the games to stop, they all returned back to the murder lottery after spending a day in their depressing realities. In true <em>Squid Game</em> fashion, one of the few parts of the competition that had any sort of moral fiber was twisted into another opportunity for those working the game to engineer more competition. </p><p>In the second season, players get to vote on the game’s continuation after every competition. To make the decision even harder, players receive an equal share of the prize money if the majority votes to leave. It grows deadlier the deeper into the competition the contestants go, especially when players wear a patch of their choice. The people who vote to stay typically feel as if more money is the only way to save their lives from the debt that could lead to their deaths. The people who vote to leave believe they’d rather be alive and broke than risk their lives for the hopes of a little more money. Even though their decisions are conflicting, they’re both rooted in survival, which inherently puts anyone voting against their decision in opposition to them living. What results from that is one of the bloodiest group fights in <em>Squid Game</em> history.</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="89cb1e803a43325c65b29183926ca8a5" data-recommend-id="image://89cb1e803a43325c65b29183926ca8a5" data-format="jpg" data-width="6462" data-height="4308" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Squid Game contestant looking serious" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Squid Game contestant looking serious" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Netflix</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="89cb1e803a43325c65b29183926ca8a5" data-recommend-id="image://89cb1e803a43325c65b29183926ca8a5" data-format="jpg" data-width="6462" data-height="4308" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Squid Game contestant looking serious" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>This is either blatant foreshadowing of the next winner in <em>Squid Game</em>, or Netflix is about to venture into a dark place of no return. In this season, Player 222, Kim Jun-hee (Jo Yu-ri), is revealed to be pregnant with the child of fellow contestant Player 333, Myung-gi (Yim Si-wan) after he ghosts her. She’s in the competition because she lost her money due to following Myung-gi’s terrible investment advice. Regardless of why she’s there, she’s officially the first pregnant woman in <em>Squid Game</em> history, which means her death could be unprecedented in the worst way.</p><p>Outside of the young guards who get killed in both seasons, <em>Squid Game</em> has pretty much excluded children from risking their lives. Given that Jun-hee’s pregnancy wasn’t overtly visible, it’s possible the organizers of the game were unaware of her bringing a fetus into a warzone. However, a child’s life being decided by their parent’s desperation is the type of social experiment <em>Squid Game</em> has come to be known for. Luckily she survives Season 2, but that doesn’t mean she or her child are in the clear just yet. </p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="a1663cf64a7f5012f189562f35d72bda" data-recommend-id="image://a1663cf64a7f5012f189562f35d72bda" data-format="png" data-width="1507" data-height="1014" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Gi-hun looking at the opposition" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Gi-hun looking at the opposition" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Netflix</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="a1663cf64a7f5012f189562f35d72bda" data-recommend-id="image://a1663cf64a7f5012f189562f35d72bda" data-format="png" data-width="1507" data-height="1014" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Gi-hun looking at the opposition" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>Gi-hun has had a one-track mindset since winning the 45.6 billion  in the first season of <em>Squid Game</em>: stop the people running the game. His first plan fails after the organizers remove the tracking chip implanted in the molar of one of his teeth meant to guide former police officer Jun-ho (Wi Ha-jun) and his team to the remote island that has eluded him for two years. Well, if you can’t bring them to justice, take them to hell. That, or some version of that mentality, was clearly at play when he staged the first attack on the guards by the contestants.</p><p>He doesn’t only remember the games he played in his first go-around, but also the human dynamics that often had depraved results. Once the contestants’ voting reached its first draw, requiring votes to be cast again the following day, Gi-hun knew those who voted to stay would see bedtime as a golden opportunity to take out dissenters from the other side of the voting aisle. He acknowledged that his plan would require fellow contestants to lose their lives, giving him and his collaborators the chance to play dead themselves before attacking guards coming out check their vital signs.</p><p>Even though his plan led to mass casualties, and was ultimately thwarted by In-ho secretly playing as Player 001, Gi-hun now knows the game’s once-impenetrable fortress has exploitable vulnerabilities. Hopefully his attack destabilized their defenses enough for his cavalry to come in and save the day. </p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="3d087d27b02b47c1488bf60af14dc49b" data-recommend-id="image://3d087d27b02b47c1488bf60af14dc49b" data-format="png" data-width="1384" data-height="947" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Gi-hun looking determined" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Gi-hun looking determined" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Netflix</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="3d087d27b02b47c1488bf60af14dc49b" data-recommend-id="image://3d087d27b02b47c1488bf60af14dc49b" data-format="png" data-width="1384" data-height="947" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Gi-hun looking determined" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>We should’ve seen this coming when show creator Hwang Dong-hyuk told <em>Entertainment Weekly </em>that he envisioned the second and third seasons as one season until he realized there were <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://ew.com/squid-game-creator-split-seasons-2-and-3-too-many-episodes-8763970&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://ew.com/squid-game-creator-split-seasons-2-and-3-too-many-episodes-8763970" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">too many episodes</a></span>. Let me speak for the rest of us binge warriors who have routinely dedicated 30 hours of streaming to watch an entire 30-episode series in one weekend: there can never be too many episodes. As a result, the second season of <em>Squid Game </em>is good, but not as satisfying as the first season, which Dong-hyuk also admits was as far as he originally planned for the story to go. </p><p>The primary issue with the truncated season is that the stakes aren’t high enough for viewing interest to be guaranteed much longer. As of now, the third season will show what ramifications will be levied against players for threatening to kill the organizers, how voting on the game’s continuation will change after the bloodbath, whether Gi-hun’s backup arrives in time, and who ultimately will win the competition. Outside of the mutiny, we’ve experienced these stakes in the first season, but they all felt a bit higher because it was our first time. Plus, <em>Squid Game</em> is less of a mystery-style thriller and more of an action thriller that derives its suspense from us clicking to the next episode and finding out how else this show will depict the survival of the fittest. </p><p>While <em>Squid Game</em>’s third season will arrive sometime in 2025, cutting the final season into two parts wasn’t a smart move. Still, if it helped Dong-hyuk get <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://variety.com/2024/tv/global/squid-game-creator-lost-nine-teeth-season-2-money-1236206385/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://variety.com/2024/tv/global/squid-game-creator-lost-nine-teeth-season-2-money-1236206385/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">more money</a></span> (and lose less teeth), then job well done. See you back on the island.  </p></div></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
