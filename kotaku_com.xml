The side-scrolling beat ‘em up is being developed by Tribute Games, who also developed<em> Mercenary Kings</em> and <em>Shredder’s Revenge</em>. Like those titles, <em>Cosmic Invasion</em> has some crunchy-looking retro-themed pixel art and animations. But now we get to see famous Marvel heroes like Wolverine and Storm all pixelated as they fight back an evil alien invasion alone or with some friends. </p><p><em>Marvel Cosmic Invasion</em> will let you play as Venom, Captain America, Wolverine, Spider-Man, Storm, Phyla-Vell, and Nova.

But there’s a lot to take in during its opening hours, from fairly in-depth gameplay mechanics and button combinations to exploring locations densely packed with secrets to uncover. I don’t want to spoil too much for you, but here are a few simple things to know before you dive into <em>AI Limit</em>.</p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="196447" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="The Top 10 Most-Played Games On Steam Deck: January 2024 Edition" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="330" data-playlist="196447,195410,196143" data-current="196447"><div><p>The Top 10 Most-Played Games On Steam Deck: January 2024 Edition</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196447/196447_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196447/196447_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196447/196447_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196447/196447_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/21996.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><h2 id="h9225"><a id=""></a>There’s no need to hoard Mud Balls</h2><p>Mud Balls are a consumable restoration item dropped by enemies or found via exploration. These make for a fantastic supplementary healing option that will gradually restore your health after use. </p><figure id="" data-id="d3d65f046a0bb5888d407c7c41d3795a" data-recommend-id="image://d3d65f046a0bb5888d407c7c41d3795a" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="An image of a menu showing the Mud Ball item and its description." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="An image of a menu showing the Mud Ball item and its description." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->SenseGames / Billy Givens / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="d3d65f046a0bb5888d407c7c41d3795a" data-recommend-id="image://d3d65f046a0bb5888d407c7c41d3795a" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="An image of a menu showing the Mud Ball item and its description." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>While you shouldn’t overuse Mud Balls when you still have plenty of remaining Life Dew (your replenishable primary healing item), you’ll find that they’re more plentiful than you’d expect. As such, don’t hoard them. Instead, use them to top off your health in the middle of intense boss battles, or as a last resort during long treks between Branches (this game’s version of bonfires).</p><h2 id="h9226"><a id=""></a>Look out for safes</h2><p>During the opening sewer level, you’ll occasionally stumble upon safes with a red valve on the front. However, these don’t really stick out from the rest of the environment; if you don’t know they can be interacted with, you’re likely to just wander past them. But there’s some good stuff inside, so keep an eye out and open any you come across.</p><figure id="" data-id="72ae3ff8c1cae8baf45010f24e20cddf" data-recommend-id="image://72ae3ff8c1cae8baf45010f24e20cddf" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="An image of Arissa staring at an open safe within a dark sewer." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="An image of Arissa staring at an open safe within a dark sewer." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->SenseGames / Billy Givens / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="72ae3ff8c1cae8baf45010f24e20cddf" data-recommend-id="image://72ae3ff8c1cae8baf45010f24e20cddf" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="An image of Arissa staring at an open safe within a dark sewer." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>For example, an early safe contains the Traveler’s Outfit, a solid all-around armor set that will offer some much-needed extra defense. You can find it in a room right after heading up some stairs for your first encounter with an enemy type that wields a giant pipe as a weapon. </p><h2 id="h9227"><a id=""></a>Yes, you can change your Seals</h2><p>If you look at your Status screen, you’ll notice you have a Main Seal equipped. You may even find additional Normal Seals as you explore. It can be frustrating when you realize you can’t find a way in which to use or change these Seals.</p><figure id="" data-id="47a911b0d72da3a835d7560e5adeaa0c" data-recommend-id="image://47a911b0d72da3a835d7560e5adeaa0c" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="An image of a menu showing a collection of Seals that can be equipped." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="An image of a menu showing a collection of Seals that can be equipped." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->SenseGames / Billy Givens / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="47a911b0d72da3a835d7560e5adeaa0c" data-recommend-id="image://47a911b0d72da3a835d7560e5adeaa0c" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="An image of a menu showing a collection of Seals that can be equipped." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Don’t fret, though! As you journey through the game’s second main area, the Outer-Wall Ruins, you’ll come across an item that lets you rewrite these Seals while resting at any Branch. Just remember that each Main Seal has a set number of Normal Seals that can be applied to it, so choose your loadout carefully based on which stat bonuses will benefit your build the most.</p><h2 id="h9228"><a id=""></a>You can access the Notepad for gameplay tips</h2><p>There are a lot of mechanics and features to keep up with in <em>AI Limit</em>. With this in mind, you may want to visit the Notepad to remind yourself of how something works from time to time. But you won’t find this in a traditional menu.</p><figure id="" data-id="cdd8da26289119751b117e2afbe3b502" data-recommend-id="image://cdd8da26289119751b117e2afbe3b502" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="An image of a menu showing a notepad filled with gameplay tips." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="An image of a menu showing a notepad filled with gameplay tips." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->SenseGames / Billy Givens / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="cdd8da26289119751b117e2afbe3b502" data-recommend-id="image://cdd8da26289119751b117e2afbe3b502" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="An image of a menu showing a notepad filled with gameplay tips." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Instead, you’ll have to open your map (right on the D-Pad on PS5), then press the appropriate button/key (Square on PS5) listed beside the word “Notepad” on the bottom right of the screen. </p><p>Hopefully, and maybe with a bit of luck, these tips will help you stay alive during the start of your journey through the challenging world of <em>AI Limit</em>, which is available now on PS5 and PC. <br></p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>With the era of the original Switch just about to set below gaming’s horizon, Nintendo has hit the internet with a curtain call of a Direct for the portable console.</p><p>While next week’s,  Switch 2-focused Direct on April 3 is likely to set the internet ablaze, this was everything we saw for today, March 27, 2025's Nintendo Direct.</p></div></div><div><p>Showing off some luscious visuals, we got a nice look at the return of <em>Dragon Quest 1</em> and <em>2</em>, which follow last year’s <em>Dragon Quest III HD-2D Remake</em>. The release is expected to arrive this year, but no solid release date was provided.</p></div><div><p>In this new detective-focused game in the <em>AI: The Somnium Files </em>series, you’ll have to help out a poor idol in distress trapped on a space station with low oxygen, solving mysteries and such to help her. <em>No Sleep For Kaname Date</em> launches on July 25, 2025.</p></div><div><p>A remastered version of <em>Raidou</em>, originally released for PlayStation 2 in 2006 as <em>Devil Summoner: Raidou Kuzunoha vs. the Soulless Army</em>,<em>&nbsp;</em>is heading to the Switch on June 19, 2025.</p></div><div><p>With some sick-looking dark environments, the edgy <em>Pac-Man </em>spin-off <em>Shadow Labyrinth</em> promises some brutal fights in which you can not only beat the crap out of your foes, but also eat them for enhanced abilities. <em>Shadow Labyrinth</em> launches on July 18.</p></div><div><p>If you have fond memories of playing <em>Patapon</em> on PSP, good news! You can relive the portable experience with remasters of <em>Pataon 1 </em>and <em>2 </em>on the Switch, launching on July 11, and get that infectious rhythm stuck in your head all over again. <br></p></div><div><p>Want another farming sim? How about a throwback to the DS era? <em>Story of Seasons: Grand Bazaar</em> hits the Switch on August 27, 2025.</p></div><div><p>With some absolutely gorgeous-looking environments, our girl Samus is back in first-person mode to hopefully escape a hostile planet. While <em>Dread</em> absolutely owned, it’s gonna be pretty sweet to focus on alien-blasting and scanning stuff yet again from inside her helmet. She’s also got some pretty neat psychic abilities for combat and exploration.</p><p><em>Metroid Prime 4: Beyond</em> arrives on the Switch sometime in 2025.</p></div><div><p>Coffee and tea are pretty sweet, but in <em>Disney Villains Cursed Cafe</em>, you’ll get to make some nifty potions with unique narrative outcomes based on your choices. The game is out today, March 27.</p></div><div><p>How about a magic school that doesn’t suck? Well, that’s the dream anyway. <em>Witchbrook</em> features some nice-looking pixel art, magical learnings, and even co-op for up to four players. The game arrives on Switch this holiday season.</p></div><div><p>Billed as a “hand-drawn platforming adventure,” <em>The Eternal Life of Goldman </em>will let you smack the crap out of fools with a cane. Fun! <br></p></div><div><p>Oh hell yeah. Schmup fans will be eating well with this sick-looking collection of the <em>Gradius</em> franchise featuring not only some classics, but also a new adventure with <em>Salamander III</em>.</p></div><div><p>Haven’t you ever wanted to start a band to take on dark forces? Well, you can live out that very dream with <em>Rift of the Necrodancer</em>, available for the Switch today, March 27.</p></div><div><p>With adorable little meeps for dialogue, <em>Tamagotchi Plaza</em> looks like a chill store-management sim where you can explore all of your retail dreams, only cuter. This one arrives on Switch on June 27.</p></div><div><p>What do you mean you still haven’t caught ‘em all? Today we got another look at <em>Pokémon Legends Z-A</em>, in which a corporation is in charge of urban development, you know, to let humans and Pokémon live in peace together. It’s totally not an open air prison for the powerless critters.</p></div><div><p>If you’re looking for a rhythm game that drills timing down to the basics, <em>Rhythm Heaven Groove</em> eschews grand storylines and epic settings for something a bit more focused on timing your button presses to the beat. Past entries have been a delight, so it’s great to see this series make its way to Switch.</p></div><div><p>Hey, there’s a new Switch on the horizon. It’s left many of us wondering what’s gonna happen with our digital games; after all, many of us have dumped a fair bit of coin into that eShop. </p><p>Fortunately, Nintendo is promising us the ability to easily transport digital games via a virtual game card management system across two different Nintendo Switch systems (the trailer seems to indicate that’s the limit). You’ll also be able to share games within your Nintendo family. The feature is coming to both the Switch and the Switch 2, and is expected to arrive in April of this year.</p></div><div><p>Stoner-FPS-fest <em>High On Life</em> is hitting the Nintendo Switch on May 6, perfect for extended periods of couch lock for you troublemakers.</p></div><div><p>Promising speedy action adventure across a strange alien world, <em>Star Overdrive</em> lands on the Switch on April 10.</p></div><div><p>This alien settlement management sim arrives on the Switch on July 17.</p></div><div><p>A sequel to the Nintendo 3DS’ <em>Fantasy Life, The Girl Who Steals</em> <em>Time </em>promises open-world exploration and item crafting when it arrives on the Switch on May 21 of this year.<br></p></div><div><p>1999 PlayStation RPG<em> Saga Frontier II </em>is getting a remaster on the Switch. The original narrative is joined by some new story material and characters. <em>Saga Frontier II</em>’s remaster arrives on Switch today.</p></div><div><p><em>Monument Valley 1 </em>and <em>2 </em>promise chill adventures across geometrically complex environments. This package, which includes all DLC, on April 15, 2025. The third game, which released on Android in December of 2024, will also make its way to the Switch this summer.</p></div><div><p><em>Everybody’s Golf</em>, aka <em>Hot Shots Golf</em>, is making the leap from Sony platforms to the Switch with the appropriately titled <em>Everybody’s Golf: Hot Shots. </em>It arrives on Switch later this year. </p></div><div><p>If you’re craving some retro beat ‘em up action with legendary superheroes like Spider-Man and Wolverine, <em>Marvel Cosmic Invasion</em> looks like a pretty swell time, with single and cooperative play. <em>Marvel Cosmic Invasion </em>arrives this holiday season.</p></div><div><p>The event’s final game reveal showed off the newest <em>Tomodachi</em> release in 10 years with this strange teaser that is already resulting in memes galore on social media.</p></div><div><p>At the very end of the event, Nintendo announced that they’ll continue the Direct series of video presentations, but they’re also launching a new channel via an app called Nintendo Today. It promises to update you every day with Nintendo news, which will be especially promising for next week’s big Switch 2 reveal. </p><p>The app is available for download today.</p><hr><p><br>And that wraps everything we saw at the original Switch’s final Nintendo Direct!</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
