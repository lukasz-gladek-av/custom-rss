Originally released in Japan in September 2023, <em>Ys X</em> now at last has a worldwide English-language release. And yet, despite all this, you’ve never played a <em>Ys</em> game! Let us convince you this is the perfect place to start.</p><p>Before I say anything to you about <em>Ys X: Nordics</em>, I need to level with you for a second: <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/ys-x-nordics-guide-lacrimosa-dana-oath-felghana-1851635135&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/ys-x-nordics-guide-lacrimosa-dana-oath-felghana-1851635135">I’m a huge fan of Nihon Falcom’s <em>Ys</em> series</a></span>. This long-running action-RPG series has captivated me since I first played <em>Ys I&amp;II </em>on the TurboGrafx-CD, and my casual blogging about the series eventually turned into my professional writing career. Every writer has inherent biases to consider when recommending a video game on the internet, and it’s only fair that you know that my biases are especially strong in this case.</p><p>With that said, after pouring roughly 50 hours into the official English version of <em>Ys X: Nordics</em>, I’m here to tell you that I <em>really</em> loved playing this game. This is easily the biggest evolution the series has seen in its core gameplay since <em>Ys Seven</em>, and I eagerly sought out every side quest and optional boss I could find just to make the experience last. Despite the absolute deluge of quality RPGs released this year, <em>Ys X</em> is one of my favorite games of 2024.</p><p>If you’ve never dipped your toes into <em>Ys</em> before, know that <em>Ys X</em><strong> is a mostly self-contained story early</strong> in the overall series canon. You can jump right into this game without feeling like you’re missing the plot from the other games. With that said, is <em>Ys X</em> really the best way to get into the series, or should you opt for one of the earlier entries instead? To answer that, I’ll break down my biggest pros and cons about <em>Ys X</em> below, and I’ll give my firm opinion on who I think would most enjoy playing <em>Ys X</em> first at the end.</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="5cf161af2f3d15d324c12620c787c63e" data-recommend-id="image://5cf161af2f3d15d324c12620c787c63e" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt=" A boy with red hair swings his sword to hit the leg of a giant golem.

Other recent <em>Ys</em> games played as fast-paced hack-and-slash action-RPGs, with an emphasis on perfectly timed dodging and switching between party members to exploit enemy weaknesses. In <em>Ys X</em>, the party system has been minimized, and there are no more enemy weaknesses. Protagonists Adol and Karja now fight in tandem as you rapidly switch between the two to barrage enemies with quick strikes and build huge combos. Similarly, the dodge mechanics have mostly coalesced into Adol and Karja’s block function, with perfectly timed parries resulting in the series’ trademark “Flash Guard.”</p><p>These changes transform the combat of <em>Ys X</em> so much that my muscle memory from past <em>Ys</em> games completely failed me at first. However, once I got the hang of it, I couldn’t believe the colorful flurries of quick sword strikes I was pulling off on screen. Since Adol and Karja have separate SP meters which their special attacks consume, combat felt like a dance where I constantly looked for the right moments to tag the two in and out of battle to maintain a functionally endless stream of special attacks. Meanwhile, by activating the “Duo Mode,” Adol and Karja fight as a singular unit to deliver weighty attacks that I used to generously dispatch huge groups of foes and lay the smack down on bosses whenever they left themselves open.</p><p>Duo Mode pairs perfectly with <em>Ys X</em>’s block, as perfectly timed parries cause Adol and Karja to lock steel with their foes until they push them back and inflict damage-boosted counter attacks. Make no mistake, this is still a very fast action game, just like previous series entries—it’s just that <em>Ys X</em> isn’t afraid to slow the action down at times, to let you build up to those moments of sheer speed the previous games were known for. Falcom basically created a battle system that embodies the feeling of a well designed <em>Sonic The Hedgehog</em> level.</p><p>I could go on, but at this point, you can just look at combo videos uploaded from the Japanese release of <em>Ys X</em> and see how cool it looks in motion yourself. It’s just good, man.</p><h3 id="h119622"><a id=""></a>The cast of characters is lovable</h3><figure id="" data-id="e5bb503bc11ce4b0c90739d95d0116ef" data-recommend-id="image://e5bb503bc11ce4b0c90739d95d0116ef" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1081" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="A boy with red hair excitedly talks to a girl with a blond hair as she disapprovingly gives him a side eye glare." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A boy with red hair excitedly talks to a girl with a blond hair as she disapprovingly gives him a side eye glare." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Nihon Falcom / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="e5bb503bc11ce4b0c90739d95d0116ef" data-recommend-id="image://e5bb503bc11ce4b0c90739d95d0116ef" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1081" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="A boy with red hair excitedly talks to a girl with a blond hair as she disapprovingly gives him a side eye glare." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p><em>Ys</em> games generally aren’t known for gripping storylines. However, this series excels at creating warm atmospheres where virtually every NPC has a name and their own personal stories that advance in the background of the main plot. <em>Ys X</em> especially excels on this front, featuring an emotive crew that supports Adol and Karja as they sail the seas in their boat. However, in a surprising twist for the series, it’s the protagonists that steal the show this time around.</p><p><em>Ys X</em> is a coming of age tale, in which teenagers Adol and Karja are literally bound together by a thread of fate (it’s literally wrapped around their wrists like cuffs) as they join forces to figure out why they’re so attached, and rescue the residents of the town Carnac. While Adol is typically a silent protagonist, he’s surprisingly expressive in <em>Ys X</em>. He’s a flighty goofball with a mischievous streak, but his boundless thirst for adventure and his penchant to run headfirst into danger makes him easy to root for when the chips are down. Meanwhile, while Karja comes off as a stereotypical tsundere at first, her calculated demeanor endeared me to her as she grew into the leader that the people of Carnac needed. Make no mistake, though; Karja’s just as much the badass fighter that Adol is, and it’s a joy to see how well together they work as a team</p><p>Even as soon as the game’s second chapter, Adol and Karja establish a genuine, earnest bond with each other as they share stories of their lives and support each other through their hardships. Whenever they defeat a major boss together, they celebrate with a fistbump or a highfive in exactly the same way you might rejoice after beating a tough challenge with a friend in a video game. They have disagreements and get into nasty arguments, but if anything, these moments further drive home just how authentic their bond together feels. <em>Ys X</em> feels surprisingly personal, and it’s one of the best ways to get to know series protagonist Adol. It’s a low-stakes story by RPG standards, but the overarching themes of realizing your potential and finding meaning in life resonated with me thanks to how well the characters were written.</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="c8cb6ea80d785961130fca0b9e8b5c82" data-recommend-id="image://c8cb6ea80d785961130fca0b9e8b5c82" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1081" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="A boy with red hair looks down at a large red treasure chest." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A boy with red hair looks down at a large red treasure chest." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Nihon Falcom / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="c8cb6ea80d785961130fca0b9e8b5c82" data-recommend-id="image://c8cb6ea80d785961130fca0b9e8b5c82" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1081" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="A boy with red hair looks down at a large red treasure chest." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p><em>Ys X</em> naturally isn’t perfect, and these were my biggest nitpicks throughout my playthrough.</p><h3 id="h119623"><a id=""></a>It’s a surprisingly slow burn</h3><p>In the past, <em>Ys</em> games were generally no-nonsense action-RPGs. After only a handful of minutes to set up the story, the older entries generally threw you headfirst into adventure and carried that energy until you reached the end credits. By comparison, <em>Ys X</em> spends much more time establishing its cast and setting the stage for its story. To its credit, it sprinkles in combat throughout its introduction, and does at least make its tutorials go by pretty fast. Still, the game doesn’t quite hit its stride until Chapter 4, even though I still had fun up until that point.</p><h3 id="h119624"><a id=""></a>The enemy variety is a bit weak</h3><p>As much as I loved the combat system of <em>Ys X</em>, I did wish it had more unique challenges to test my mettle. The pool of common enemies is surprisingly limited, with the same foes popping up in almost every single dungeon in the game. One miniboss appears a double digit number of times before the game ends. You could argue this is a good thing for action game newbies, since you’ll have several opportunities to learn how to perfectly parry each enemy’s attacks. Still, I did feel corners were cut in the enemy design.</p><p>The game does give its enemies some new attacks as you progress, so it’s not all the same from start to finish. I also never felt a feeling of repetition sink in thanks to just how quickly Adol and Karja unlock new special attacks to level up. Still, once I saw some of the crazy bosses that pop up in the final act, I wished I’d seen those kinds of challenges throughout the entire game.</p><h3 id="h119625"><a id=""></a>It’s visually a little bland</h3><p><em>Ys</em> games generally operate on modest budgets, so cutting-edge graphics were never on the table for <em>Ys X</em>. Still, as I sailed from island to island, I found locations started to blend together, since they mostly looked the same. I can’t say for sure if <em>Ys X</em> recycles textures from <em>Ys VIII: Lacrimosa of Dana</em>, but I did consistently feel I wasn’t looking at anything new.</p><p>To be fair to <em>Ys X</em>, the characters themselves are wonderfully expressive. There are some really fun cutscenes that endeared me even more to the main cast of characters, so the graphical budget was invested wisely overall. Again, this just felt like an area where corners were cut. Given the state of the game industry right now, I personally can’t hold this too hard against Falcom.</p><h3 id="h119626"><a id=""></a>Older <em>Ys</em> games had stronger soundtracks</h3><p>I want to be very clear here: <em>Ys X</em> has very good music. This is the first <em>Ys</em> game to feature Shuntaro Koguchi, and his contributions capture the catchy hooks and energy that have made past entries in the series so memorable. There are several tracks in the game that I have repeated nonstop since I finished the game, which includes an absolute banger of a final boss track.</p><p>Still, the soundtrack of <em>Ys X</em> doesn’t quite evoke that sense of awe that past games in the series consistently captured. That “<em>Ys</em> moment” where the adventure kicks off while some of the best video game music you’ve ever heard in your life plays never really came to me, even though I still enjoyed the tunes. Bafflingly, some of the strongest songs in the soundtrack are criminally underutilized. One song that could have easily evoked that “<em>Ys</em> moment” was relegated to the end credits! Again, this is a very good soundtrack by RPG standards, just a weaker one by <em>Ys</em> standards.</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="03b391dfc32072e3f72499d94d7e4ea4" data-recommend-id="image://03b391dfc32072e3f72499d94d7e4ea4" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="A boat creates a wake as it cuts through a vast expanse of water." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A boat creates a wake as it cuts through a vast expanse of water." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Nihon Falcom / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="03b391dfc32072e3f72499d94d7e4ea4" data-recommend-id="image://03b391dfc32072e3f72499d94d7e4ea4" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="A boat creates a wake as it cuts through a vast expanse of water." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>This is neither good nor bad in my book, but this piece wouldn’t be complete if I didn’t talk about arguably the most divisive part of <em>Ys X</em>. For the first time in the series, <em>Ys X</em> features a classic RPG-style world map that Adol’s group traverses via a boat. These segments are a game within a game, as you can get into battles with enemy ships and upgrade your vessel with materials you find on your journey. This is conceptually similar to the airship traversal from the Dreamcast classic RPG <em>Skies of Arcadia</em>, which means I can finally check “talk about <em>Skies of Arcadia</em> this year” off my to-do list.</p><p>I enjoyed this seafaring side of the game, but it doesn’t make the best first impression. Boat combat is wildly different from the game’s core battle system, and at the start of the game, your vessel is <em>very</em> slow. Pro tip: <strong>Wait to focus on traveling to marked locations on your map until you’re about halfway through Chapter Four</strong>. This is when you can start purchasing speed upgrades that make the boat way easier to handle, and you’ll actually start to spot points of interest in the distance that are worth traveling to. There’s no need to frustrate yourself trying to fill in your map and beat ship battles in the early game.</p><p>Funny enough, there is a toggle in the options menu to instantly max out your boat’s stats. So if you <em>really</em> hate the boat sections, you can at least circumvent it quite a bit.</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="43ad15c24d6de857679de81358b66471" data-recommend-id="image://43ad15c24d6de857679de81358b66471" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Two fighters attack a large jellyfish monster in unison as bright streaks of fire and ice shine off of their weapons." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Two fighters attack a large jellyfish monster in unison as bright streaks of fire and ice shine off of their weapons." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Nihon Falcom / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="43ad15c24d6de857679de81358b66471" data-recommend-id="image://43ad15c24d6de857679de81358b66471" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Two fighters attack a large jellyfish monster in unison as bright streaks of fire and ice shine off of their weapons." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>Again, I want to stress that I <em>really</em> liked <em>Ys X: Nordics</em>. I’d rank it as a top five <em>Ys</em> game. As far as whether you should start with <em>Ys X</em>, I’d specifically recommend it for two groups of people.</p><p><strong>1: If you’re an action game enthusiast, <em>Ys X</em> should be your starting point</strong>. The combat mechanics are so enthralling and expressive once you get a handle on the controls, and even on the Nightmare difficulty I never felt like <em>Ys X</em> demanded grinding to win. If you enjoyed the gameplay of <em>Final Fantasy XVI</em>, you should enjoy <em>Ys X</em>.</p><p><strong>2: If you already know you want to play the rest of the <em>Ys</em> games, <em>Ys X</em> is an excellent starting point</strong>. It’s one of the earliest games in the overall series timeline, and the ending literally segues right into 2012’s <em>Ys: Memories of Celceta</em>. From there, you can follow the Chronology of <em>Ys</em> <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.digitalemelas.com/index_ys.php&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.digitalemelas.com/index_ys.php" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">as laid out by Digital Emelas</a></span>, and you can take a detour to play <em>Ys I&amp;II</em> and <em>Ys Origin</em> whenever you feel ready for them.</p><p><strong>For everyone else, <em>Ys X: Nordics</em> is a good starting point for the series, but the “best” starting point is debatable</strong>. While <em>Ys X</em> moves the series forward in important ways, it stumbles a bit in areas that fans especially value in these games. The music and consistent high energy has always been the soul of <em>Ys</em>, so a lesser showing on these fronts does make <em>Ys X</em> land slightly weaker than other past games have. <strong>If you’d like to learn about other starting points I’d personally recommend, you can check </strong><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/ys-x-nordics-guide-lacrimosa-dana-oath-felghana-1851635135&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/ys-x-nordics-guide-lacrimosa-dana-oath-felghana-1851635135"><strong>my <em>Ys</em> starter guide here</strong></a></span>.</p><p>Regardless, <strong>I do recommend you play <em>Ys X: Nordics</em> in one way or another, especially if you’ve bothered to read this far</strong>. A <strong>demo</strong> for the game is out now on PC, PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, and Nintendo Switch, which does allow you to transfer your save file to the full game. By the time you approach the end of the demo content, you should hopefully see what makes <em>Ys X</em> so special. Or maybe you won’t—I don’t know what life is like for someone who never owned a TurboGrafx growing up.</p><p>.</p></div></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Every year they’ve got a new line of merch for every holiday and occasion. It’s a collector’s dream and their wallet’s nightmare. This year is no different, because The Pokémon Company has revealed some adorable plushies for its 2024 holiday line, and these little guys are so cute, it makes me want to decorate for the holidays before Halloween is even here.</p><p>The Holiday Poké Plush line includes a handful of the cutest, cuddliest little shits you’ve ever put in a Poké Ball and dresses them up in winter wear. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.pokemoncenter.com/product/72-10060-101/pikachu-pokemon-holiday-plush-10-in&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.pokemoncenter.com/product/72-10060-101/pikachu-pokemon-holiday-plush-10-in" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Pikachu</a></span> is the clear centerpiece with a light blue sweater with a shining Staryu smack dab in the middle, and a big Santa hat hanging off the side of his head. But the standout, in my opinion, is the <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.pokemoncenter.com/product/72-10062-101/maushold-pokemon-holiday-plush-14-in&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.pokemoncenter.com/product/72-10062-101/maushold-pokemon-holiday-plush-14-in" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Maushold</a></span> plush. The Pokémon made up of a family of three or four mice could have given us each of the rodents separately with individual winter outfits, but The Pokémon Company knows how to commit to a bit, and Maushold’s whole schtick is that it’s treated as one Pokémon despite seemingly being multiple critters. So Maushold has a long scarf stretching around the entire family of mice and wrapping them together. And hey, the family of three is the same price as Pikachu, so that’s three plushies for the price of one.</p><p>While the bigger plushies are the draw, the Holiday line also includes smaller keychains that are just as adorable. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.pokemoncenter.com/product/72-10058-101/dedenne-pokemon-holiday-plush-key-chain&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.pokemoncenter.com/product/72-10058-101/dedenne-pokemon-holiday-plush-key-chain" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Dedenne</a></span>, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.pokemoncenter.com/product/72-10059-101/cubchoo-pokemon-holiday-plush-key-chain&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.pokemoncenter.com/product/72-10059-101/cubchoo-pokemon-holiday-plush-key-chain" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Cubchoo</a></span>, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.pokemoncenter.com/product/72-10057-101/espurr-pokemon-holiday-plush-key-chain&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.pokemoncenter.com/product/72-10057-101/espurr-pokemon-holiday-plush-key-chain" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Espurr</a></span>, and <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.pokemoncenter.com/product/72-10056-101/pawmi-snowman-pokemon-holiday-plush-key-chain&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.pokemoncenter.com/product/72-10056-101/pawmi-snowman-pokemon-holiday-plush-key-chain" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Pawmi</a></span> are each featured as part of the line, all dressed in winter clothes. Espurr sits in a stocking, but the Cubchoo keychain is probably my favorite. I’m a sucker for the snot-nosed little guy, and he looks so warm in his oversized scarf.

After much thought, we have determined the best path forward is to permanently sunset the game and close the studio.   I want to thank all of Firewalk for their craftsmanship, creative spirit and dedication.”</p><p>Firewalk Studios was formed in 2018 as a few ex-Bungie developers working on a new multiplayer shooter under the umbrella of the gaming studio startup Probably Monsters, formed by ex-Bungie CEO Harold Ryan. <em>Concord</em> was in development for years and picked up by Sony early on as a promising prospect for its portfolio of planned live service games. </p><p>The initial development deal for the game was just over $200 million, according to two sources familiar with the agreement but who were not authorized to speak publicly about it. But <em>Kotaku </em>understands that amount was not enough to cover the game’s entire development and did not include the purchase of<em> Concord</em> IP rights or Firewalk Studios itself, which Sony acquired only last year.</p><p><em>Concord</em>, a mix of <em>Destiny 2</em>-style PvP shooting and <em>Overwatch 2</em>'s hero roster, struggled out of the gate following its full reveal at the PlayStation Showcase this past May. Initial trailers received overwhelmingly negative reactions from prospective players, and open betas over the summer didn’t do much to change those perceptions. The final game reviewed okay, but critics by and large felt there was not enough to help <em>Concord</em> standout in an already crowded field of other established multiplayer shooters that were mostly free-to-play.</p><p>With some analysts estimating the game <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.ign.com/articles/concord-is-estimated-to-have-sold-only-25000-units-heres-why-analysts-think-its-failing&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/concord-is-estimated-to-have-sold-only-25000-units-heres-why-analysts-think-its-failing" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">only sold around 25,000 copies</a></span> in its first week, <em>Concord </em>was later taken offline less than a month after it launched. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/concord-firewalk-studios-relaunch-ps5-sony-playstation-1851652811&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/concord-firewalk-studios-relaunch-ps5-sony-playstation-1851652811"><em>Kotaku</em> previously reported</a></span> that game director Ryan Ellis had internally stepped down from his management role on the game while its future was assessed by Sony leadership. The rest of the team, meanwhile, was left in limbo to wonder if Firewalk might be put to work on other Sony projects or shut down entirely. </p><p>Hulst also announced today that Neon Koi, which was also acquired by Sony in the last few years, would be closing as well, and the multiplayer mobile shooter it was working on would be canceled. </p><p>Here is the full statement Sony:</p><blockquote data-type="BlockQuote"><p>Dear Team, </p><p>Today, I want to share some important updates from Sony Interactive Entertainment’s Studio Business Group. </p><p>We consistently evaluate our games portfolio and status of our projects to ensure we are meeting near and long-term business priorities. As part of our ongoing efforts to strengthen SIE’s Studio Business, we have had to make a difficult decision relating to two of our studios – Neon Koi and Firewalk Studios. </p><p>Expanding beyond PlayStation devices and crafting engaging online experiences alongside our single-player games are key focal areas for us as we evolve our revenue streams. We need to be strategic, though, in bringing our games to new platforms and recognize when our games fall short of meeting player expectations. </p><p>While mobile remains a priority growth area for the Studio Business, we are in the very early stage of our mobile efforts. To achieve success in this area we need to concentrate on titles that are in-line with PlayStation Studios’ pedigree and have the potential to reach more players globally. </p><p>With this re-focused approach, Neon Koi will close, and its mobile action game will not be moving forward. I want to express my gratitude to everyone at Neon Koi for their hard work and endless passion to innovate. </p><p>Regarding Firewalk, as announced in early September (<span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://blog.playstation.com/2024/09/03/an-important-update-on-concord/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://blog.playstation.com/2024/09/03/an-important-update-on-concord/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">An Important Update on Concord</a></span>), certain aspects of Concord were exceptional, but others did not land with enough players, and as a result we took the game offline. We have spent considerable time these past few months exploring all our options. </p><p>After much thought, we have determined the best path forward is to permanently sunset the game and close the studio.   I want to thank all of Firewalk for their craftsmanship, creative spirit and dedication. </p><p>The PvP first person shooter genre is a competitive space that’s continuously evolving, and unfortunately, we did not hit our targets with this title. We will take the lessons learned from Concord and continue to advance our live service capabilities to deliver future growth in this area. </p><p>I know none of this is easy news to hear, particularly with colleagues and friends departing SIE. Both decisions were given serious thought, and ultimately, we feel they are the right ones to strengthen the organization. Neon Koi and Firewalk were home to many talented individuals, and we will work to find placement for some of those impacted within our global community of studios where possible. </p><p>I am a big believer in the benefits of embracing creative experimentation and developing new IP. However, growing through sustainable financials, especially in a challenged economic environment is critical. </p><p>While today is a difficult day, there is much to look forward to in the months ahead from the Studio Business Group and our teams. I remain confident that we are building a resilient and capable organization driven by creating unforgettable entertainment experiences for our players.   </p></blockquote><blockquote data-type="BlockQuote"><p>Thank you for your continued support. </p></blockquote></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
