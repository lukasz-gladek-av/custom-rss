              <p>In the wake of the phenomenal success of <em>Balatro</em>, we are going to be treated to all manner of gambling-adjacent roguelites. And bring them on, I say! Coming soon we have picture-pairs deckbuilder <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3509430/Replicat/"><em>Replicat</em></a>, another cat-themed game in Mahjong-based roguelite <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3332060/Feng_Shui_Meowjong/"><em>Feng Shui: Meowjong</em></a>, and deckbuilding-meets-slot-machine-meets-rune-matching game&nbsp;<a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3073990/Runeborn/"><em>Runeborn</em></a> (which is out next week). One of the first to reach us, however, is&nbsp;<a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3314790/CloverPit/?curator_clanid=38011635"><em>CloverPit</em></a>, a slot-machine-themed game that takes the inherent sadness of plunging all your money into a cold, indifferent machine to a grim, deadly place. And it’s very tough to stop playing.</p> <p>There’s something fundamentally sad about a slot machine. First and foremost, because they’re the grimmest form of gambling: there’s no skill involved at all because every single machine is&nbsp;<em>fixed</em>, paying out when its programming tells it to, and designed to always take in far more than it ever gives. There’s also something unpleasantly ironic about their bright, cheerful presentation, colorful fruits and gems spinning around as a hundred colored lights flash on and off in enticing patterns, all designed to take your money. It’s within this contradiction that <em>CloverPit</em> makes its home, presenting its rotating fruits and treasures on a dilapidated machine, complete with a very concerning blood stain on one corner, and put inside a small, grimy cell-like room. Oh, and if you don’t win enough money, you die.</p>

 <p>There’s a demonic nature to all the proceedings, the game’s dirty pixel graphics reminiscent of 2021’s horror card game <em>Inscryption</em> (one of a number of games with which it can be bought in <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/bundle/58319/CloverPit_x_Inscryption/">a two-game bundle</a>), and a subtitled narrator mockingly explaining your predicament. You need to make a fixed number of coins within three rounds of playing on the slot machine, and if you fall short the floor opens up beneath you and you fall to your death. Should you succeed, the target goes up for what it calls a new Deadline, and three more rounds begin.</p>

 <figure id="attachment_2000631035" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000631035"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000631035">© Panik Arcade / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p>Of course there’s a lot more to it than that. Through playing you not only win coins, but also tickets, and these can be used to buy “lucky charms” from a small cabinet behind you. The randomly selected items (chosen from an ever-growing number that are unlocked through reaching certain milestones as you play, one of which involves going for a shit in the room’s filthy toilet) add detailed bonuses, like giving more value to certain symbols or causing other symbols to appear more often, or perhaps randomly triggering the chance for an extra spin in a round. The more you play, the more complicated these bonuses can be, like Fortune Teller’s “25% chance for the chain modifier to be applied to any symbol, decreased by 5% at the end of every round,” where chain modifiers improve the value of particular patterns formed by matching symbols on the three-by-five slot machine display…Like I said, it gets complicated.</p>

 <p>Another crucial element is that for each round, you can choose to play three spins and receive two tickets at the end, or play seven spins and get only one ticket. That imbalance is perfect, forcing you to significantly sacrifice winnings to unlock a more expensive Charm, or risk not getting more bonuses and just going to spins. On top of this, between each Deadline a dirty, red phone will ring, <em>Deal or No Deal</em>-style, and you’re offered the choice of one of three buffs or debuffs. Oh, and there are drawers you can unlock, and there’s a little computer that stores data on all the Charms you’ve unlocked, and the requirements for those you’ve not. It’s an impressive amount to pack into one tiny little prison.</p>

 <figure id="attachment_2000631034" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000631034"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000631034">© Panik Arcade / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p>Perhaps&nbsp;<em>CloverPit</em>‘s greatest advantage is that, just like in real life, those one-armed bandits are compelling machines. There’s a reason we have the cliche of the tragic, hunched figure, feeding coin after coin into the Las Vegas slot machine at 3 a.m. Just pulling the virtual arm in the game and seeing the symbols spin around is enticing. And like real fruit machines, the results are very fixed. Your “luck” is a measurable metric in the game, boosted by Charms, increasing the likelihood of high-scoring patterns of cherries and lemons appearing. This, as it happens, is also the game’s greatest weakness.</p>

 <p>The comparisons with&nbsp;<em>Balatro</em> are very much invited when <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/bundle/58846/CloverPit__Balatro/">the game can be bought bundled with it</a>. But while&nbsp;<em>Balatro</em>‘s poker-themed rogue-ish ways certainly involve a great deal of luck, there’s also an enormous amount of skill involved in shaping a good run from the elements thrown at you. This definitely feels less the case in <em>CloverPit</em> in which, despite the intricacies of the available Lucky Charms and the enormous bonuses available should you wisely combine the attributes of those which work well together, it still always feels far too much like your chance of completing a Deadline can come down to whether the game decides to throw a super-successful spin your way. While you <em>can&nbsp;</em>improve your luck, you can’t purposefully bring on a “jackpot” where every single symbol matches, and you’re pretty certain to earn enough cash.</p>

 <p>It’s also the case that the Charms don’t add anywhere near as much variety to a run as the dozens of different ways you can approach a run at <em>Balatro</em>. This game lacks that sense of, “Oh, I reckon this should be a three-of-a-kind run,” based on your early jokers and planet cards. Instead, you just sort of play the best of what you get, and hope it works out. When it doesn’t, you die and start over.</p> <figure id="attachment_2000631036" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000631036"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000631036">© Panik Arcade / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p>The important thing is that starting over remains very compelling. It’s a fast game, nippily speeding through its various elements, meaning you’re never left frustrated by a bad predicament. And of course, the more you play, the more becomes revealed, like what those drawers are for and why, when you put a Charm inside one in one run, it’s replaced by a severed piece of a corpse in the next. Yeah, that’s a thing.</p> <p>That creepiness adds a lot to&nbsp;<em>CloverPit</em>, with the overriding questions of why exactly you’re being tortured in a disgusting pit with a murderous slot machine always haunting you. It’s splendid how just about every element feels&nbsp;<em>wrong.&nbsp;</em>I mean, I completely forgot to mention the flies buzzing around the bin of what I think might be meat that sits below the slot machine itself.</p> <p>So while this doesn’t manage to survive a comparison with the titan that is&nbsp;<em>Balatro</em>, it’s also the case that no one ever said it should have to. Though I’d love to feel a bit more autonomy over my chances of success, this is ultimately a game about the unfairness of a slot machine that’ll make you want to experience it over and over and over.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>We’re now only four weeks out from the NYC marathon. It’s time to make sure you have all the gear you need picked out. What shorts you’re wearing, perhaps a belt to carry your phone, maybe a fresh pair of running shoes if your current pair are reaching their limit — lots of prep to be done. My question is, how satisfied are you with your watch? Do you even have a watch? Some folks in my run club choose to just carry their phone in hand. It always irks me when I’ve forgotten to charge my watch and now need to run with my phone, I can’t imagine just choosing to do that every time. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4449/">Well, anyway, right now Garmin has its Forerunner 55 GPS watch on sale ahead of Prime Big Deals Day, going for 25% off.</a> You can save $50 as the price comes down from $200 to just $150 for a limited time.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4449/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Garmin Coach</h2>
<p>A GPS watch is your window into your performance. Track your miles, pace, time elapsed and more. The Garmin Forerunner 55 goes even further than than, able to act as your fitness coach. It can provide you with daily suggestions of varying intensities based on previous workouts and fitness level, tailoring your training to you. You can even plan your race day strategy with PacePro, offering GPS-based pace guidance for various courses or distances.</p>
<p>Beyond running, this watch can be used for cycling, Pilates, and even pool swims. When not being used for a workout, the watch can track useful health and wellness metrics such as your heart rate. A favorite feature of mine is Body Battery. This breaks down all your activity, heart rate, and other bits of data to estimate your energy level at any time throughout your day, allowing your to find the best time to either workout or get your rest in.</p>



<p>The Garmin Forerunner 55 has a 1.04-inch capacitive touch screen. It uses a transflective memory-in-pixel display which allows it to be seen clearly in direct sunlight and total darkness alike.</p>
<p>Battery life is super solid. The issue with using a smartwatch like the Apple Watch or a Samsung Galaxy Watch as your running watch is you’ll have to plug it in almost every night for a recharge. The Garmin Forerunner 55 can last up to two weeks. And like those other smartwatches, you can even receive emails, texts and other notifications right on your wrist after pairing it with your phone.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4449/">Choose between three different colors. The Garmin Forerunner 55 is available in either black, aqua, or white — all now discounted down to just $150.</a></p>

Normally, when a studio sets a sequel this long after the first, it’s to make it easier for newcomers to jump in, and they don’t have to worry so much about continuity between previous games. For the most part, </span><i><span>Yotei </span></i><span>is pretty separate from </span><i><span>Tsushima</span></i><span>, but it does have one side quest that directly ties the two together, answers some questions about what happened to the previous protagonist, Jin Sakai, and maybe raises a few more.</span></p>  <p><span>In the side quest titled “The Storm Blade,” <em>Yotei</em> protagonist Atsu is guided through a discrete area in Mount Yotei, which includes what looks like a centuries-old weapon cache full of some items fans might recognize, like a helmet and a horse saddle. As Atsu climbs through the area, she finds Jin Sakai’s sword hidden in a cave. Just then, however, she’s waylaid by enemies, one of whom steals the blade and makes his escape, prompting Atsu to give pursuit. Tracking him down, she also finds what seems to be Jin’s final home and resting place. We then learn from Ugetsu, the game’s resident storyteller, that Jin went on to become the first Shinobi and that “some say” he lived out his final days in Ezo. Once you complete the quest, you’ll get Jin’s sword and armor set.</span></p>

              <p>December feels forever away but here’s the thing: <strong>LEGO drops its Advent calendars in September</strong> for a reason. And if you’ve ever waited until November, you already know the truth: by then, the deals are gone, the stock’s low and you’re stuck paying full price. But right now, the LEGO City Advent Calendar 2025 (the most loved one in the lineup) <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4349/">is hiding on Amazon at an all-time low of just $25, down from $34.99</a>, and it’s available for everyone, Prime or not, until tomorrow night.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4349/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See LEGO City Advent Calendar 2025 at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>A Holiday Countdown That Feels Like Magic</h2>
<p>This isn’t just a calendar: It’s 24 bursts of joy, one door per day. Your kid (or you?) gets to open a fresh surprise every morning—mini builds, fun accessories, and adorable mini-figures—all the way through to Christmas. And what about the mini-figs: Santa and Mrs. Claus are on the job, along with laugh-out-loud hilarious characters of Santa in a reindeer costume, Mrs. Claus as a polar bear, and even Mrs. Claus as a walking Christmas tree.</p>



<p>The great part? It’s made for kids 5 and up and each little build has simple instructions tucked just behind the door. No frustration, no confusing instructions – just the happy “aha!” moment when they click the pieces into place. And the pièce de résistance: <strong>the calendar flips open into a big playmat</strong>. One minute it’s a countdown, the next it’s a winter wonderland holiday party scene where all the figures come to life. Kids can mix and match their other LEGO City sets, build wacky scenarios and play for hours.</p>
<p>Parents, pay attention: how many times can you receive a gift that provides something new each day? That keeps the anticipation going, promotes patience and sparks creativity without the use of a screen? This calendar does all of the above – and it’s only $25 today at Amazon. That’s close to a ten-dollar discount, and it doesn’t often go this low except for Prime Day or Black Friday.</p>

              <p>We’re closing in on Prime Big Deals Day. This is Amazon’s sales even taking place next week on October 7 and October 8. You can expect to see all sorts of deals covering a range of consumer tech, kitchen appliances, apparel, and more. Even though it’s not quite here yet, some deals have already started pouring in. Take a look over the the Fire HD 10. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4448/">This Amazon tablet built for relaxation and fun normally is currently as much as 56% off.</a></p>
<p>There are four different versions of Amazon’s latest tablet. You can choose between having 32GB or 64GB of capacity as well as whether you want to put up with lock screen ads or not. If you don’t mind being bombarded with Alan Ritchson’s beefy shoulders and chiseled face promoting&nbsp;<em>Reacher&nbsp;</em>every time you reach for your tablet, you can get the Fire HD 10 for as low as $70. The 32GB is down to that from $140 while the 64GB is down to just $80 (originally $180). If&nbsp; you’d prefer not to have to look at ads on a device you own whenever you use it, you’re looking at a price point of $85 for the 32GB model and $95 for the 64GB model. If you end up going with the ad-enabled version but change your mind later, no worries. You can pay a one-time fee of $15 to have them removed after the fact.</p>

<p>As you can surmise from the name, this Fire HD 10 comes with a 10-inch HD 1080p screen (well, 10.1 inches to be precise). It makes for a terrific gift for the holidays for any friend, family member, or loved one.</p>
<h2>Bring Your Movies and Shows Anywhere</h2>
<p>This tablet supports a battery life of up to 13 hours. You’ll be able to binge an entire season or more of a TV show in one charge (at least a modern TV show from after we stopped making 24-episode long seasons).</p>



<p>The Fire HD 10 is both light and durable, allowing you to take it with you anywhere easily. This tablet makes for a great travel companion as you’re able to download your favorite stuff to take along with you so you can watch movies or shows without having to pay for the in-flight Wi-Fi.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/discord-fortnite-roblox-terrorism-surveillance-extremist-fbi-2000631018</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Federal investigators and researchers at the National Counterterrorism Center (NCTC) are brushing up on gaming. A reportedly leaked briefing document shows the agency born out of 9/11 to combat global terrorism is taking a closer look at what&nbsp; “violent extremist US teens” are doing in online gaming platforms ranging from <em>Fortnite</em> to Battle.net.</p> <p>Published by <a href="https://danboguslaw.substack.com/p/leaked-intel-brief-shows-feds-terrified">independent journalist Dan Boguslaw</a>, the alleged NCTC document lists a bunch of different places people play games and each one’s functionality. The full list includes Battle.net, Discord, <em>Fortnite</em>, PlayStation Network,<em> Roblox, </em>Steam, Twitch, and Xbox Live. Discord, which the gunman who allegedly <a href="https://kotaku.com/charlie-kirk-shooter-steam-library-valve-discord-radicalization-2000626897">assassinated Charlie Kirk</a> used to discuss the murder, is the only platform that’s listed as checking every functionality box: “text chat,” “voice chat,” “video chat,” “image sharing,” “friend lists,” and “discoverable communities.”</p>

 <p>“Some violent extremist US teens probably play online games or use gaming-affiliated networks and applications (apps), and could use these apps to communicate with like-minded individuals, conduct plotting, or spread terrorist messaging, judging from a past report of extremist use of online gaming to enable terrorist activity,” the leaked memo reads.</p>

 <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">Seems pretty clear the government is coming for Discord users <a href="https://t.co/SFc4yApeAU">pic.twitter.com/SFc4yApeAU</a></p> <p>— Ken Klippenstein (NSPM-7 Compliant) (@kenklippenstein) <a href="https://twitter.com/kenklippenstein/status/1973463700918116392?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 1, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <p>You’ll note that the document isn’t concerned only with the plotting of potential terrorist activities but also “terrorist messaging,” whatever that is. Following the assassination of Charlie Kirk, gaming-affiliated platforms like Discord, Twitch, and Steam have been called <a href="https://kotaku.com/charlie-kirk-shooter-discord-politics-helldivers-memes-2000626029">to testify before Congress</a>. President Trump <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/09/designating-antifa-as-a-domestic-terrorist-organization/">recently proclaimed</a> Antifa a terrorist organization and the Heritage Foundation right-wing think tank <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/heritage-foundation-uses-bogus-stat-to-push-a-trans-terrorism-classification/">called on the FBI</a> to officially label “Transgender Ideology-Inspired Violent Extremism,” or “TIVE,” as a domestic terrorism threat category.</p>

 <p>The reported NCTC memo is quick to point out in a footnote that “the mere presence of an individual on one or more online gaming platforms is not indicative of any nefarious activity,” and that “law enforcement action should not be taken solely on the basis of the exercise of constitutionally protected rights.” But it does say that communication on these platforms could be grounds for further investigation if authorities “observe suspicious behavior.”</p> <p>There are a few notable absences on the sheet. YouTube is not mentioned at all, despite a wealth of gaming content and an algorithmic engine for pointing users toward it like a fire hose. Nintendo Switch Online is also missing despite the fact that the Switch 2 just rolled out video sharing and GameChat. I guess the country’s terrorism experts don’t think anyone is plotting political violence inside <em>Mario Kart World</em>.</p>

              <p>Technically, you can use your standard office monitor for gaming, but is it the same as a dedicated screen that’s built to chase enemies with exceptional refresh rates and near-instant response time? Not really.</p>
<p>You need gear that keeps up, and right now, you can upgrade without paying the full price. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4447/">Amazon has dropped the Samsung 24-Inch Odyssey G3 (G30D) to just $110, which is a massive 45% off.</a> You’re saving $90 on a display that’s going to make you feel like you’re in the middle of the action, but the discount ends soon.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4447/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Mind-Boggling Refresh Rate, Stunning Screen</h2>
<p>Lags and blurs are frustrating. You can’t just sit and wait for your screen to catch up while your opponent gets away. Odyssey G3 packs an impressive 180Hz refresh rate and 1ms response time for ultra-fast visuals that give an in-game advantage. Jumping on an enemy squad the moment you spot them, or slipping away from a close fight, becomes much easier.</p>
<p>Bid farewell to image tearing and mid-action interruptions, too, because AMD Radeon FreeSync makes sure your monitor and graphics card stay in sync – always in real time. There’s Black Equalizer to brighten dark areas in the game, and Virtual Aim Point to line up shots more precisely. Basically, whether you’re checking dark corners for bad guys or going for the clutch shot, this monitor keeps up. Even better, blue light is actively minimized to keep your eyes comfortable, and reduced screen flicker makes it easier to fight the demons for longer.</p>



<p>As for the screen itself, you’re getting a decent 24-inch FHD display that pushes stunning, vibrant visuals. The 3-sided borderless design offers maximum space to play, and will also come in handy when you run a dual-monitor setup. The monitor’s height can be fully adjusted, and you can tilt, swivel, or pivot it to match your ideal setup. Port-wise, you’ll find a Power port, Headphone IN, HDMI IN, and a DisplayPort IN around the back.</p>
<p>If you’ve been playing on your standard monitor or laptop and want to upgrade to something more powerful, the Samsung 24-Inch Odyssey G3 (G30D) is an excellent option to consider. It gets you an exceptional display with an even better refresh rate and response time, which are sure to take your gaming experience up a notch. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4447/">The monitor usually retails for $200, but this deal brings it down to $110, which is a much more affordable price point.</a></p>
