The free-to-play third-person hero shooter has quickly become one of the biggest games of the year, with hundreds of thousands of players logging in every day, just on Steam alone. And now, just a few weeks after launch, developer NetEase has announced the first major in-game event for <em>Marvel Rivals</em>, and as you might expect, it’s Christmas-themed. </p><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://youtu.be/Be5Err7ygLs&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://youtu.be/Be5Err7ygLs" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">On December 16, NetEase released a trailer</a></span> for “The Winter Celebration,” a new update arriving on all platforms.

That trailer contains four Jeff the Landsharks fighting four other Jeffs in a mode that seems tailored to annoy people who hate this tiny healer. Meanwhile, as someone who loves Jeff and plays with him a lot, I’m very excited about this new mode and Jeff’s adorable ski outfit. </p><p>Interestingly, this new limited-time holiday mode looks to basically be a knock-off version of Nintendo’s <em>Splatoon</em>. Four Jeffs take on four other Jeffs to spray snow across the map and try to cover as much of it as they can before the time runs out. So it looks like NetEase is willing to pull from other games beyond <em>Overwatch </em>for “inspiration.” </p><p> .<br></p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Read on for a recap of everything we’ve gleaned thus far about Naughty Dog’s next game.</p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="195928" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="How Alan Wake 2 Builds Upon The 'Remedy-Verse'" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="190" data-playlist="195928,195922,196345" data-current="195928"><div><p>How Alan Wake 2 Builds Upon The 'Remedy-Verse'</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195928/195928_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195928/195928_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195928/195928_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195928/195928_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/21446.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><h2 id="h14074"><a id=""></a><strong>What is <em>Intergalactic: The Heretic Prophet</em> about?</strong></h2><p><em>Intergalactic </em>follows a space-faring bounty hunter named Jordan A. Mun who ends up stranded on a planet called Sempiria. Communication with the planet has been dark for over 600 years, and no one has left its orbit in all that time. Jordan goes to Sempiria in search of members of the Five Aces crime syndicate, apparently because she’s in desperate need of the bounty. They seemingly have history, as in Jordan’s ship, we see a photo of her and what appears to be other members of the group, though the specifics of her relationship with them are unconfirmed. Once she reaches the planet’s surface, she’s faced by hostile robots and likely other dangers.</p><p>That’s the gist of what we know of the main plot, but as far as the larger world of <em>Intergalactic</em>, director Neil Druckmann explained to <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/12/arts/intergalactic-heretic-prophet-naughty-dog-druckmann.html&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/12/arts/intergalactic-heretic-prophet-naughty-dog-druckmann.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>The New York Times</em></a></span><em> </em>that Jordan’s story will also include some kind of fictional religion at the center and explore “what happens when you put your faith in different institutions.” Druckmann also said that <em>Intergalactic </em>takes place in an alternate future in which space travel had become pretty advanced by the 1980s. That’s why you’ll notice several retrofuturistic elements in Jordan’s space ship, including a CD player on which she spins “It’s a Sin” by the Pet Shop Boys and a CRT television on which she watches anime.</p><p><em>Intergalactic</em>’s reveal trailer definitely feels like it’s cut from the same cloth as <em>Uncharted </em>and <em>The Last of Us</em> in terms of being a “prestige” cinematic story-driven game, and Druckmann says much of the team’s inspiration came from anime like <em>Akira </em>and <em>Cowboy Bebop</em>. Fans have even noted that some details in the trailer appear to be homages to <em>Akira</em>, from Jordan’s red jacket to the CD player in her ship.</p><h2 id="h14075"><a id=""></a><strong>Who’s involved?</strong></h2><p>While we only know the broad strokes of the game’s story and haven’t seen any actual gameplay yet, we do know a fair number of the key personnel attached to <em>Intergalactic</em>. Druckmann is the creative director after leading both <em>The Last of Us </em>games and <em>Uncharted 4</em>, with Naughty Dog veterans Matthew Gallant and Kurt Margenau both acting as game directors.</p><p>Jordan is played by actor Tati Gabrielle, who Naughty Dog fans may recognize from her role in the <em>Uncharted </em>movie as mercenary leader Jo Braddock, a character who kinda felt like a stand-in for <em>Uncharted 4</em> and <em>Lost Legacy</em>’s antagonist-turned-ally Nadine Ross. By the time <em>Intergalactic </em>is out, fans will likely be even more acquainted with her, as she plays Nora in <em>The Last of Us</em>’ upcoming second season.</p><p>Outside of Gabrielle, we know a few other actors who will make an appearance in <em>Intergalactic</em>. Halley Gross, the co-writer and narrative lead on <em>The Last of Us Part II</em>, will play AJ, Jordan’s agent, as seen in the announcement trailer. <em>The Big Sick </em>and <em>Eternals </em>actor Kumail Nanjiani will appear as Colin Graves, one of the Five Aces Jordan is hunting. <em>Better Call Saul </em>actor Tony Dalton is also playing a member of the Five Aces, but the character’s name is unknown right now. Troy Baker, who plays Joel in <em>The Last of Us </em>games and <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/the-last-of-us-ep-8-david-scott-shepherd-nolan-north-1850181044&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/the-last-of-us-ep-8-david-scott-shepherd-nolan-north-1850181044">James in the HBO series</a></span>, is also <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/troy-baker-neil-druckmann-naughty-dog-indiana-jones-1851707293&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/troy-baker-neil-druckmann-naughty-dog-indiana-jones-1851707293">confirmed to play a character in <em>Intergalactic</em></a></span>.</p><p>Lastly, the duo of Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross are composing music for the game. The two have written countless scores for films over the years, with some recent standouts including <em>Challengers </em>and <em>Queer</em>. This marks their first time working on a video game score together.</p><h2 id="h14076"><a id=""></a><strong>What’s the plan for the future?</strong></h2><p>Druckmann told <em>The New York Times</em> that Naughty Dog had been restructured as “an IP powerhouse” following <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/sony-playstation-layoffs-london-studio-closure-1851289547&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/sony-playstation-layoffs-london-studio-closure-1851289547">layoffs</a></span> over the past year, and the studio is aiming for <em>Intergalactic </em>to become a big new franchise for PlayStation. Whether or not that comes to pass will depend on how the first game does, but given Sony’s propensity to milk games for spin-offs and external media, I wouldn’t doubt that Sony wants <em>Intergalactic </em>to spawn sequels and maybe some TV or movie adaptations. Naughty Dog is already <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.naughtydog.com/blog/intergalactic_the_heretic_prophet_announcement&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.naughtydog.com/blog/intergalactic_the_heretic_prophet_announcement" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">presenting the game as a “franchise”</a></span> in its official announcement, so it sounds like expectations for this one are pretty high. We’ll see how it all pans out at some point in the coming months or years, as right now we don’t know when <em>Intergalactic </em>will actually make its way to our PlayStation 5s.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Following the reveal of the game’s first trailer at The Game Awards 2024 last week, the studio confirmed that the character’s previous actor,  Jo Wyatt, has been replaced by Ciara Berkeley. She performs the role in the new trailer and will be Ciri’s voice for the entire game, and potentially any further sequels. <br></p><p>  “Ciara Berkeley was cast as Ciri for <em>The Witcher IV </em>Cinematic Reveal Trailer,” a CDPR spokesperson told <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.thegamer.com/the-witcher-4-ciri-voice-actor-jo-wyatt-recast-rumours/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.thegamer.com/the-witcher-4-ciri-voice-actor-jo-wyatt-recast-rumours/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>The Gamer</em></a></span> in a statement. “Ciara is a talented actress who impressed us with her enthusiasm and vocal acting skills, and in this trailer we believe she truly brought Ciri to life in a way that is both faithful to the character and exciting for fans of the series.”</p><p>Ciri, a princess with mystical blood and magic powers turned witcher under the tutelage of her adopted family, was playable at various points in<em> The Witcher 3</em> as Geralt tried to track her down amid an impending interdimensional apocalypse. She was still a young person growing up throughout her journey, with the 2015 blockbuster serving as a sort of coming-of-age tale for her. </p><p>In <em>The Witcher 4</em> trailer, Ciri’s tone is much less innocent, hopeful, and enthusiastic. Now a veteran monster slayer in her own right, she sounds hardened by the cruel world around her and the burden of constantly making the “lesser of two evil” trade-offs that the games and the Polish fantasy novels they’re adapted from are known for. Berkeley performs the role well, though I’ll miss Wyatt for sure. </p><p>Geralt, on the other hand, who is voiced by Doug Cockle across the existing <em>Witcher</em> trilogy, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/witcher-4-geralt-ciri-open-world-rpg-trailer-voice-date-1851720593&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/witcher-4-geralt-ciri-open-world-rpg-trailer-voice-date-1851720593">will return in some form</a></span> with the same actor at the helm.

But worry not, <em>Silo</em> fans: the superb adaptation of Hugh Howey’s novels has been <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.gamesradar.com/entertainment/sci-fi-shows/hit-apple-tv-plus-show-silo-gets-renewed-for-two-final-seasons-to-tell-the-complete-story-of-hugh-howeys-sci-fi-book-series/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.gamesradar.com/entertainment/sci-fi-shows/hit-apple-tv-plus-show-silo-gets-renewed-for-two-final-seasons-to-tell-the-complete-story-of-hugh-howeys-sci-fi-book-series/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">officially confirmed</a></span> for a full four-season run.</p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="197298" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="Live Forever in the Universe of 'New World: Aeternum'" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="108" data-playlist="197298,197284,197260" data-current="197298"><div><p>Live Forever in the Universe of 'New World: Aeternum'</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197298/197298_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197298/197298_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197298/197298_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197298/197298_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"></video></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>First self-published in 2011, Hugh Howey’s short story “Wool” became a word-of-mouth phenomenon. Eventually spawning three novels known as the Silo series, these are the basis for Apple’s <em>Silo</em>, the story of a post-apocalyptic society living in a colossal underground—well—silo. Written by <em>Justified</em>’s Graham Yost, and starring Rebecca Ferguson (<em>Dune</em>), David Oyelowo and Tim Robbins, its second season is currently being released weekly on Apple TV+, and damn, it’s so good.</p><p>While the timing might seem a little awkward given the similarity of <em>Silo</em>’s setting to <em>Fallout</em>’s post-disaster underground societies, the two shows play out very differently. While Amazon’s <em>Fallout</em> adaptation has certainly given more attention to bunker life than the games usually do, <em>Silo</em> doesn’t afford anyone the option to go outside. Any who try are seen falling dead only moments after committing the heinous heresy of leaving the silo.</p><p>The result is utterly compelling, the complex nature of the hierarchical systems of the silo existing in conflict with the mysteries that lie behind its walls (and mirrors),  all oriented around Ferguson’s Juliette Nichols. She’s a mechanic, born high up but living down low, unable to escape the consequences of her parents’ actions, and unafraid of the blasphemy rules around owning “old tech,” essentially anything with a CPU.</p><p>I love it. Having read the short story so long ago, the show has offered the most extraordinary realization of the scenario, with stunning performances, beautiful direction, and the most incredible set design. Given recent trends, I’d normally know better than to get attached to such an excellent sci-fi show!</p><h2 id="h12854"><a id=""></a>It’s tough to be sci-fi</h2><p>It’s been a brutal couple of years for fantasy and sci-fi fans. Netflix cancelled <em>Shadow and Bone</em>, <em>Welcome to Eden</em>, <em>1899</em>, and <em>Kaos</em>, while Disney+ snuffed out <em>The Acolyte</em>, and Apple TV+ barely gave the adored <em>Time Bandits</em> a chance to shine, as well as killing off <em>Constellation</em>. Let alone <em>What We Do in the Shadows</em>, <em>Superman &amp; Lois</em>, <em>Andor</em>, <em>Arcane</em>, <em>The Boys</em>, and <em>The Umbrella Academy </em>all coming to intended ends either now or next season. It’s becoming a real issue that <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://variety.com/2023/tv/news/frequent-tv-series-cancellations-affect-viewership-1235553780/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://variety.com/2023/tv/news/frequent-tv-series-cancellations-affect-viewership-1235553780/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">people just aren’t watching new streaming shows</a></span> because the chances of them getting canceled are so high, it’s not worth the emotional investment.</p><p>So it’s a real joy to learn that Apple has renewed <em>Silo</em>, not just for a third season  but for a fourth as well, with the intention that the show wrap up at that point. After all, by then it’ll have run out of books and short stories to adapt.</p><p>In Apple’s press release, the company quotes series creator Graham Yost explaining, “With the final two chapters of <em>Silo</em>, we can’t wait to give fans of the show an incredibly satisfying conclusion to the many mysteries and unanswered questions contained within the walls of these silos.” Which is another enormous relief, given how this isn’t a <em>Lost</em> or a <em>From</em>—not getting answers here, when they’re tangibly available to those in the know, would be agony. (Or you could read the books, I suppose.)</p><p>Ferguson, who not only does the vast amount of the show’s heavy lifting through her astonishing performance, is also a hands-on executive producer on the program. She adds, in rather unfortunate press-release-ese, “I have always felt passionately about telling the entire story contained within Hugh Howey’s books, so I couldn’t be happier that audiences around the world have enthusiastically embraced the show. I cannot wait to dive into these final two thought-provoking seasons that will beautifully conclude this dystopian tale.” </p><p>If you’ve access to the catacombs of Apple TV+, definitely give <em>Silo</em> a watch. It’s worth noting that as of the last month, Apple’s stuff can now be accessed via Amazon Prime in the U.S. and UK, making it a far less arcane streamer to find.</p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
