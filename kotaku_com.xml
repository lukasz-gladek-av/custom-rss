              <p>Almost five years after <em>Final Fantasy VII Remake Intergrade</em> brought the game to PlayStation 5, that version of the game is getting a free new update that will add a new “streamlined” mode to the game for people who just want to enjoy the story. This patch will arrive on January 22, just in time for the RPG’s launch on <a href="https://kotaku.com/ff7-switch-2-remake-framerate-final-fantasy-2000622094">Switch 2 and Xbox Series X/S</a>.</p> <p>“To celebrate <em>Final Fantasy VII Remake Intergrade</em> launch day on Nintendo Switch 2 &amp; Xbox, a patch for the PS5 and PC versions will launch next Thursday,” Square Enix announced on January 15. “This introduces Streamlined Progression, including the ability to keep HP and MP topped up, and always hit for 9,999 damage!” Now every attack can be an Omnislash and you won’t even have to spend over 500 hours <a href="https://kotaku.com/final-fantasy-vii-player-hits-level-99-in-the-first-rea-1794171766">grinding at the first reactor to make it happen</a>.</p>

 <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">To celebrate Final Fantasy VII Remake Intergrade launch day on Nintendo Switch 2 &amp; Xbox, a patch for the PS5 and PC versions will launch next Thursday.</p> <p>This introduces Streamlined Progression, including the ability to keep HP and MP topped up, and always hit for 9,999 damage! <a href="https://t.co/XMuEdhreTP">pic.twitter.com/XMuEdhreTP</a></p> <p>— FINAL FANTASY VII (@finalfantasyvii) <a href="https://twitter.com/finalfantasyvii/status/2011740264772305213?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 15, 2026</a></p></blockquote>  <p>The previously teased Streamlined Progression mode is effectively a story mode for people who want to follow Cloud and his Avalanche pals in their journey through Midgar to topple Shinra without having to deal with all of the difficulty that might come from combat, and especially certain boss encounters. Instead of toggling the game to easy, players can make it so their characters are already maxed out and hitting for the most damage possible.</p>

 <p>While included at launch in the new ports, the patch will let existing players on PC and PS5 play around with the mode as well. Could it be an easy way to clear the game on hard for the Platinum trophy? Maybe! And for newcomers it’s worth noting that anyone who buys the game digitally before the end of the month will automatically get the digital version of the original <em>Final Fantasy VII</em> along with it.</p>
