              <p>Bose’s <em>QuietComfort</em> line leads the way for the company in active noise cancellation, and Amazon just dropped the price to an unprecedented record low that makes premium audio accessible to anyone. The <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4702/">QuietComfort headphones now sell for $169, slashed from the usual $349 (51% off)</a> and provide active noise cancellation and high-fidelity sound for less than half the price of the original.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4702/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Noise Cancellation That Works</h2>
<p>Active noise cancellation technology suppresses ambient sound incredibly well and creates that quiet bubble when traveling by airplane, train, or working in a noisy office. It suppresses background chitchat, the rumbling of engines and air conditioning humming immediately when Quiet Mode is on so you can just tune in to your music or work without diversion. The system works both through <strong>active electronic cancellation and passive isolation</strong> provided by the plush ear cushions and stops sound within a very wide range of frequencies.</p>
<p>Aware Mode works the opposite way and pipes the ambient sound into your ears with external microphones and enables you to hear your surroundings without removing the headphones. This is useful if you want to hear airport announcements or have quick conversations, or be more attentive to the traffic while walking. Quiet and Aware modes toggle instantly with a button press for seamless control over how much of the outside world you want to let in.</p>



<p>Plush ear cushions softly <strong>encompass your ears in their over-ear design</strong>, rather than pressing hard against them. With even pressure distribution from the memory foam padding, hot spots and discomfort do not develop during extended wear like they can with poorly designed headphones. The padded headband keeps everything secure without pulling tight across the top of your head.</p>
<p>The<strong> 24-hour battery life easily covers multiple days of typical use</strong> without the need for frequent charging. You can take these on weekend trips without packing the charging cable, and commuters easily get through a full work week on a single charge. Then, USB-C fast charging gives you 2.5 hours of playback from just 15 minutes plugged in-perfect for when you forgot to charge overnight and you’ve got to leave soon.</p>



<p><strong>High-fidelity audio reproduction reproduces clear and detailed sound</strong> in all frequency spectra. Bass hits with impact and depth, yet does not overpower the mid or muddy the vocals. Treble stays crisp and present but never gets harsh and fatiguing even on longer listening sessions. The Adjustable EQ in the Bose app lets you customize the sound signature to match your preferences: boost the bass for hip-hop or elevate the treble to make classical music shine.</p>
<p>Multipoint Bluetooth connectivity lets you p<strong>air with two devices at the same time</strong> while switching between them automatically, depending on which one is playing audio. You can watch videos from your laptop and jump right into your phone calls without having to manually disconnect and reconnect. The feature does away with the frustration of juggling multiple devices all day long. Bluetooth range of up to typical home and office distances is covered without dropouts or issues in connectivity.</p>
<p>At $169, you’re paying less than half the original price for flagship Bose noise cancellation, 24-hour battery life, and premium comfort that competing headphones at this sale price can’t match. This record low price on Amazon brings legendary audio quality within reach and you shouldn’t miss that opportunity.</p>
