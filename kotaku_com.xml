            <link>https://kotaku.com/xbox-game-pass-car-cloud-gaming-lg-kia-2000624462</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/microsoft%E2%80%99s-%E2%80%98everything-is-an-xbox%E2%80%99-crusade-is-coming-for-your-car.1292856/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Microsoft wants to turn your car <a href="https://kotaku.com/meta-quest-3s-xbox-vr-game-pass-price-handheld-1851784984">into an Xbox, too</a>. Not content just to stream Game Pass to your TV, laptop, or smartphone, it‚Äôs also aiming to beam hits like <em>Forza Horizon 5</em> directly into your Kia Sportage. Microsoft and LG announced a new partnership on Tuesday to bring Xbox Cloud Gaming to over 20 million internet-connected vehicles by 2030. Who‚Äôs ready to play <em>The Elder Scrolls 6</em> in the back of their Uber?</p> <p>‚ÄúOur work with LG is the latest example of Xbox expanding to new places, building on partnerships that already bring Xbox Cloud Gaming to mobile devices, PCs, and TVs,‚Äù Xbox marketing VP Christopher Lee <a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2025/09/09/xbox-cloud-gaming-vehicles-cars-lg/">said in a blog post</a>.&nbsp;‚ÄúBy adding vehicles to the mix, we‚Äôre giving players more choice than ever in how they enjoy their games.‚Äù</p>  <p>The initiative only pertains to EVs that support LG‚Äôs webOS Automotive Content Platform (ACP) which at this point is primarily Kia and mostly not in the U.S. But LG exec Eun Seok-hyun is promising there will be 20 million of these vehicles on the road&nbsp;<em>somewhere</em> in the next five years. Whether that includes the country where Microsoft is headquartered or not will depend on whether Congress ever revives the electric vehicle tax credit program it recently killed. Otherwise anyone who wants to make their car into an Xbox will have to do it <a href="https://xboxfreedom.com/xbox-360-game-car-installation-2265">the old-fashioned way</a>.</p> <p>Xbox‚Äôs recent pivot to being hardware-agnostic comes as it‚Äôs developing dedicated gaming OS layers for Windows on PC handhelds and bringing more of its exclusives to PS5 and Switch 2. It‚Äôs unclear if that will move the needle much on the overall growth of Game Pass, which hasn‚Äôt announced <a href="https://kotaku.com/diablo-4-game-pass-xbox-podcast-date-1851261824">new subscriber numbers in over a year</a>. This new campaign to turn cars into Xboxes comes just as Microsoft announces <a href="https://www.theverge.com/report/774414/microsoft-return-to-office-policy-announcement">a mandatory return</a> to the office for all employees within a 50-mile radius of its Redmond campus. Now they‚Äôll have something new to do while sitting in traffic, at least eventually.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>How much champagne do you charge to the company credit card when <em>GTA 6</em> mercifully shifts out of your release window? Which celebrity will star in <em>Cyberpunk 2</em>? And what game are <em>Helldivers 2</em>‚Äòs devs working on next? Welcome to another edition of Morning Checkpoint, <em>Kotaku</em>‚Äòs daily roundup of gaming news and culture.</p> <p>People are buzzing <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1757300/Jump_Space/">about <em>Jump Space</em></a>, the sci-fi co-op adventure about blowing up spaceships with friends. It comes to Early Access next week and already has an impressive <a href="https://x.com/KeepsakeGames/status/1965398533546160523">post-launch roadmap</a> of updates lined up. How many more cool ship games will we get before<em> Starfield</em>‚Äòs <a href="https://nitter.poast.org/StarfieldGame/status/1963980745728229522#m">next expansion arrives</a>?</p> <h2>It was a good day in the Sucker Punch offices when <em>GTA 6</em> delayed</h2> <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/ghost-of-yotei-tsushima-sony-ps5-state-of-play-1851786081"><em>Ghost of Yotei</em></a> is one of the biggest game releases of the fall, at least now that <em>GTA 6</em> has been delayed to May 2026. Creative director Nate Fox was asked about that moment in a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ffOTS1CkZVg">new rapid-fire interview with <em>MinnMax </em></a>(via <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/that-was-a-great-day-ghost-of-yotei-studio-screative%20director%20Nate%20Fox"><em>VGC</em></a>). ‚ÄúWhen<em> GTA 6</em> was delayed, did the entire studio pop some champagne?‚Äù host Ben Hanson asked. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre all still hungover. Multi-month hangover,‚Äù Fox responded. ‚ÄúThat was a great day.‚Äù</p>

 <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/ghost-yotei-release-date-gta-6-collector-edition-1851777437"><em>Yotei</em>‚Äòs October 2 release date</a> was announced before Rockstar revealed its delay, locking in its fate one way or the other. Fortune favors the bold. Now lots of games that were waiting to come out until 2026 to escape <a href="https://kotaku.com/gta-6-aaaaa-silksong-next-gen-pc-devolver-digital-2000623190">the<em> GTA 6</em> gravity</a> well are faced with a new conundrum: get out ahead of it or come out later in the year and risk stumbling into a second <em>GTA 6</em> delay?</p> <h2 data-cy="article-headline"><em>Helldivers</em>&nbsp;studio‚Äôs next game will have a <em>Destiny</em>-style social hub</h2> <p>But what is it, exactly? Arrowhead CEO Shams Jorjani seemed to be speaking off the cuff when he responded to a fan in the game‚Äôs Discord who requested a place where <em>Helldivers 2</em> players can hang out in between drops. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs on the feature list for the next one,‚Äù Jorjani teased. What next one? <em>Helldivers</em> 3? Nope.</p>

 <p>‚ÄúThis was about our next game. Not <em>HD3</em>,‚Äù he added <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Helldivers/comments/1nbmucr/comment/nd46h3l/">on Reddit</a>. Some fans are wondering if it‚Äôs a nod to the studio‚Äôs isometric fantasy multiplayer series <em>Magicka</em>. The studio has already confirmed that its next project, whatever it ends up being, <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/paultassi/2025/05/15/helldivers-2-studios-next-game-will-be-free-from-playstation-partnership/">won‚Äôt be published by Sony</a>.</p> <h2>Fans think <em>GTA 6</em> parody website names have leaked</h2> <p>The open-world blockbuster is still over six months away, but in the meantime players may have some fresh teases to parse. What seem like in-game website names <a href="https://gtaforums.com/topic/1002286-gta-vi-general-speculation-discussion-vice-city-baby/page/51/#comment-1072587065">appear to have been registered</a> as real internet domains by Take-Two back in May. They include what-up.app, rydeme.app, and wipeoutcornskin.com. I don‚Äôt know if we‚Äôre ready for <em>GTA 6</em> in the post-internet, algorithmic slop phase of lampooning pop culture.</p>

 <h2>Will Johnny Silverhand return in <em>Cyberpunk 2</em>?</h2> <p>Because Keanu Reeves would be happy to do it if CD Projekt Red wants him back. ‚ÄúAbsolutely,‚Äù he <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/johnny-silverhand-actor-keanu-reeves-says-he-absolutely-wants-to-be-in-cyberpunk-2">told<em> IGN</em></a> when asked about reprising the role. ‚ÄúI‚Äôd love to play Johnny Silverhand again.‚Äù Effectively a virtual ghost in the first game, there‚Äôs no reason Silverhand would need to come back in a sequel, but also nothing precluding it either. <em>Cyberpunk 2</em> is set to return to Night City but <a href="https://kotaku.com/cyberpunk-2077-sequel-orion-night-new-city-chicago-cdpr-1851781566">also take players to a new location</a> likened to ‚ÄúChicago gone wrong.‚Äù</p> <h2>Satoru Iwata laughed when he heard about trying to sell <em>Animal Crossing</em> in America</h2> <p>Veteran Nintendo localizer Leslie Swan <a href="https://www.timeextension.com/features/interview-we-did-try-to-keep-forest-in-the-name-how-mario-64s-princess-peach-helped-bring-animal-crossing-to-the-west">told <em>Time Extension</em></a> that‚Äôs how the former president of the company reacted when she told him they were translating the cozy sim. ‚ÄúHe just laughed and said, ‚ÄòI don‚Äôt know how you‚Äôre going to do this.‚Äô And it‚Äôs true, just everything in that game was so specific to Japan,‚Äù she said.</p> <p>Long-time producer Takashi Tezuka was not confident either. ‚Äú[Tezuka] basically said to me, ‚ÄòWe‚Äôd like to have you localize it‚Äô and I said, ‚ÄòSure.‚Äô But then he said, ‚ÄòNo, Leslie, I‚Äôm not sure you understand, it‚Äôs going to be difficult.'‚Äù Swan recalled. ‚ÄúAnd I kept having to assure him that we would make it happen.‚Äù Decades later, the franchise is now one of the best selling in the world.</p> <h2>ICYMI:</h2> <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/hollow-knight-silksong-difficulty-hard-damage-criticism-2000624031"><em>Silksong</em> is harder than <em>Hollow Knigh</em>t, but is that a problem?</a></p> <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/black-mirror-memecoin-crypto-web3-2000624006">Tech is beyond parody: even <em>Black Mirror</em> is getting a meme coin</a></p> <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/digimon-story-time-stranger-digifarm-hands-on-preview-2000624093"><em>Digimon Story: Time Stranger</em> might be the best JRPG of the fall</a></p> <h2>Watch this:</h2>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>If you‚Äôre out there looking for a solid laptop that can handle basic, everyday tasks, then Lenovo is a manufacturer worth consideration. Maybe you‚Äôre a college student in need of something to build out documents and slideshow presentations for your classes. Maybe you‚Äôre a small business owner in need of something to, err, build out documents and slideshow presentations for your clients. Web browsing, email drafting, YouTube video watching. You know, computer stuff! Well, take a look at the Lenovo IdeaPad Slim 3. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3987/">Right now, Amazon has it on sale for 73% off. It‚Äôs listed at $2,999 but after the discount, the price comes to just $800. That‚Äôs a savings of $2,200.</a></p>
<p>Okay, but let‚Äôs hold our horses for just a moment. A $2,200 discount on a $2,299 laptop? Sounds too good to be true. So yeah, if we take a look at this items price history, we‚Äôll see this listing has only existed on Amazon since the beginning of August. After about two weeks it dropped to the price it‚Äôs at now. It briefly went back up when September hit, but now it‚Äôs back down to $800.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3987/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<p>When we take a look at the specs on offer here, you can tell this is not a three thousand dollar machine. Lenovo‚Äôs own website has various builds of the IdeaPad Slim 3 in this $600 to $800 range. This listing is trying to trick you into thinking you‚Äôre saving a lot more than you are. And that‚Äôs a shame because these specs at this price point is a pretty good deal in its own right.</p>
<h2>Deep Dive</h2>
<p>What we have here is a 15.3-inch laptop capable of displaying in 1920 by 1200 HD. The anti-glare non-touch display has 300nits of brightness and a refresh rate of 60Hz. With DisplayPort 1.2 and HDMI 1.4, you can display on two additional monitors (three displays total including the laptop screen).</p>



<p>It‚Äôs got a built-in webcam that can record in 720p HD with a shutter so you can maintain privacy when not in use. For added connectivity, you have two USB-A ports and one USB-C port to transfer data or charge your other devices. Wi-Fi 6 and Bluetooth 5.2 are also supported.</p>
<p>The real story is its RAM and storage. <strong>It‚Äôs working with 40GB of memory and an SSD containing a full 1TB of storage space</strong>. Great for backing up photos and working with large file types like 4K video.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3987/">All and all, this Lenovo IdeaPad Slim 3 is a worthwhile laptop. At $2,999? Heck no. But at $800? Not bad.</a></p>
