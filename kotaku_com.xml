It’s less spreadsheet upkeep and more vibes-based growth and exploration. </p><p><em>Endless Legend 2 </em>seems like it will stick to that winning recipe. Its announcement yesterday teased an ocean planet with constantly shifting seasons and topography, as receding water exposed new secrets. The emphasis on 4X strategy through the prism of a hero’s journey also returns, with asymmetric gameplay reflected across four unique factions. </p><p>Amplitude Studios kicked off its <em>Endless</em> franchise with <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/endless-space-the-kotaku-review-5925340&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/endless-space-the-kotaku-review-5925340"><em>Endless Space</em> in 2012</a></span>, followed by <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/endless-legend-the-kotaku-review-1655274702?_gl=1*3zbf6i*_ga*ODE3ODM5ODIyLjE3MjA0NjY0NTg.*_ga_V4QNJTT5L0*MTczNzcyODYzNy4yMi4xLjE3Mzc3MzQ2NTIuMy4wLjA.&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/endless-legend-the-kotaku-review-1655274702?_gl=1*3zbf6i*_ga*ODE3ODM5ODIyLjE3MjA0NjY0NTg.*_ga_V4QNJTT5L0*MTczNzcyODYzNy4yMi4xLjE3Mzc3MzQ2NTIuMy4wLjA."><em>Endless Legend</em></a></span><em> </em>and<em> </em><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/dungeon-of-the-endless-is-pretty-good-guys-1656663040&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/dungeon-of-the-endless-is-pretty-good-guys-1656663040"><em>Dungeon of the Endless</em></a></span><em> </em>(a tower defense rogulite action-RPG) two years later that traded the expanse of the cosmos for single planets. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/endless-space-2-the-kotaku-review-1795419442&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/endless-space-2-the-kotaku-review-1795419442"><em>Endless Space 2</em></a></span> arrived in 2017 and it was good but not quite great. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/humankind-the-kotaku-review-1847491705&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/humankind-the-kotaku-review-1847491705"><em>Humankind</em> came out in 2021</a></span> and didn’t turn out to be the <em>Civ</em> killer some had hoped for.

It’s just insane...”</p><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.ign.com/articles/final-fantasy-14-director-yoshi-p-threatens-legal-action-against-stalking-mod&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/final-fantasy-14-director-yoshi-p-threatens-legal-action-against-stalking-mod" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>IGN</em> reports</a></span> that Github has already removed the Playerscope mod from its repository for violating its terms of service, but there are worries the tool has already been backed up in other places for those willing to search it out. Threats of potential legal action also leave open the possibility of someone else making and sharing a similar mod that goes under the radar while still potentially endangering players’ privacy. </p><p>Yoshida did try to reassure fans that no personal data like payment information and home addresses are viewable using these tools, but it’s still unclear why team isn’t exploring an update to <em>FFXIV</em>’s account system as one possible solution to the larger stalking problem. “We strive to offer and maintain a safe environment for our players, which is why we ask everyone to refrain from using third-party tools,” the director wrote. “We also ask that players do not share information about third-party tools such as details about their installation methods, or take any other actions to assist in their dissemination.”</p><p>.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
