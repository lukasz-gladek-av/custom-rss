No, you’re lying, of course you haven’t, which is the secret sauce that makes <em>Like A Dragon: Pirate Yakuza In Hawaii</em> such a unique, wild ride. The argument between whether ninjas or pirates were cooler is over when you can get you a game that basically does both. God, remember back in the day when the internet was full of fun arguments over who’d win between ninjas and pirates and not, “Is this AI video of the president sucking Elon Musk’s toes like he’s trying to drink from the right grail proper resistance praxis?” We used to be a society, I swear.</p><p>Anyway, point is, thanks to the good folks at Ryu Ga Gotoku, we don’t have to choose which of our wild, lawless fantasies to live out. Although, because it’s a <em>Like A Dragon</em> game, it does mean there’s all sorts of little quirks to account for that you probably wouldn’t think you’d have to deal with turning to a life of piracy. Thankfully, we’ve got you very much covered with a few starter tips to help you hoist the colors high.</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="3b1abfaf9d5593386c195fcc80a89e9f" data-recommend-id="image://3b1abfaf9d5593386c195fcc80a89e9f" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Combat in the game, with our character glowing purple." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Combat in the game, with our character glowing purple." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Ryu Ga Gotoku Studio / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="3b1abfaf9d5593386c195fcc80a89e9f" data-recommend-id="image://3b1abfaf9d5593386c195fcc80a89e9f" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Combat in the game, with our character glowing purple." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>As per usual with <em>Yakuza/Like A Dragon </em>games, the opening minutes are quite generous when it comes to showing you the ropes of the combat, but even though <em>Pirate Yakuza </em>shows you how to do Majima’s air juggle combos, they don’t quite emphasize just how much of a boon it is to your entire moveset. For the first two chapters or so, use it because it’s cool. Later chapters, though—especially on those Devil King islands where there’s 100 dudes attempting to shove a cutlass up where dead men tell no tales—<strong>getting an enemy up in the air is the linchpin of your fights when it comes to creating some distance.</strong></p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="811be4fb0ffe7450bb73bf836cf8ed0f" data-recommend-id="image://811be4fb0ffe7450bb73bf836cf8ed0f" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="The Upgrade Ability screen." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="The Upgrade Ability screen." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Ryu Ga Gotoku Studio / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="811be4fb0ffe7450bb73bf836cf8ed0f" data-recommend-id="image://811be4fb0ffe7450bb73bf836cf8ed0f" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="The Upgrade Ability screen." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Compared to a bunch of the other titles in the series,<em> Pirate Yakuza</em> is pretty generous early on when it comes to giving you enough money and Reputation to enhance yourself. Obviously, boosting Majima’s attacks and health are no-brainer purchases you’ll never regret, but the lure of the awesome-looking Heat attacks isn’t easy to ignore. We’re not saying don’t buy any of those, but firstly, many of the other enhancements are far more crucial (and cheaper) early on, and secondly, Heat actions are bound by highly specific situations here. A fair few are only really applicable when you’re raiding an enemy ship, in fact. If there’s a very specific combat situation/button press you find yourself in, go for it. But shop smart.</p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="cf0b220b2a51c9447250f356bfedf124" data-recommend-id="image://cf0b220b2a51c9447250f356bfedf124" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="The Crew Formation screen." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="The Crew Formation screen." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Ryu Ga Gotoku Studio / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="cf0b220b2a51c9447250f356bfedf124" data-recommend-id="image://cf0b220b2a51c9447250f356bfedf124" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="The Crew Formation screen." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>Once you get some shore leave in Honolulu, you’re basically going to be awash in recruits for your ship within about an hour. There’s no downside to letting everybody aboard, but when it comes to who you should squad up with, you’re gonna need to plan for the future.</p><p>Early on, Jason Rich and Masaru are gonna be permanent fixtures in your crew. You’ll get them the earliest, but their stats stay relatively strong through the entire game. More importantly, though, is that they’re the first characters who can be boosted up to level 40. The problem with a lot of the randos you find out in the world is that even the ones with high stats might cap off at level 20. Those are crewmates who you want in there for a good time, not a long time. Have a backup character you can evolve. If you can be patient, and grind a bit before continuing the main story (the Coliseum in Madlantis is perfect for this) <strong>I recommend having a crew of all lvl 40-capables before getting into the weeds of Chapter 3</strong>, where the difficulty spikes. Speaking of…</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="d5eab2ed79e33ad8634c8c2ccbc36e84" data-recommend-id="image://d5eab2ed79e33ad8634c8c2ccbc36e84" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Our hero shoots a baddie in the belly with a very silly amount of fire." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Our hero shoots a baddie in the belly with a very silly amount of fire." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Ryu Ga Gotoku Studio</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="d5eab2ed79e33ad8634c8c2ccbc36e84" data-recommend-id="image://d5eab2ed79e33ad8634c8c2ccbc36e84" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Our hero shoots a baddie in the belly with a very silly amount of fire." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Once you finally land in Honolulu, the more typical <em>Like A Dragon</em> experience takes over for a while. Most of it’s a direct copy-paste from<em> Infinite Wealth</em>, but in terms of sheer money-making potential, <strong>the bounties are the best and most reliable money maker in the game</strong>. You’ll see the pink handcuffs dotted around the map, but right off the bat, after you take down your first one and leave the bar, there’ll be a guy worth $16,000 right down the block. You’d think with that high a price tag, you’re about to face Malenia, Blade of Miquella, but in reality, the price tags tend to correspond with the amount of health they have rather than difficulty. Hell, there are bounties worth $4k that are more of a pain in the ass due to the sheer numbers of enemies. Point being, don’t be afraid to go on safari for these guys when you’re low on cash, and don’t be afraid to take on big fish.</p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="c93bc972d3a6258148408f14ae9cdbda" data-recommend-id="image://c93bc972d3a6258148408f14ae9cdbda" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1079" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="A mighty ship battle with a lot of fire." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A mighty ship battle with a lot of fire." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Ryu Ga Gotoku Studio / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="c93bc972d3a6258148408f14ae9cdbda" data-recommend-id="image://c93bc972d3a6258148408f14ae9cdbda" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1079" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="A mighty ship battle with a lot of fire." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>Of course, it wouldn’t be a proper pirate game without some great ship-to-ship combat on the high seas, and sure, you could just position your flank and fire away like a loser, but this is <em>Like A Dragon</em>, things can get so much wilder than that. For starters, yes, anyone who played <em>Assassin’s Creed Black Flag</em> will have no problem picking up on the fact that you can ram straight into other ships for massive damage, only here they’re actually boosted by fuel tanks that can t-bone other boats to pieces in a heartbeat.</p><p>The real fun begins when you start messing with weapon loadouts, where the typical pirate ship cannons can get upgraded, and in terms of bang for buck, <strong>the flamethrowers are ridiculously overpowered in the early chapters</strong>, able to melt down most enemy ships in seconds.</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="fa483da7085491d97a72ceebebb51ee2" data-recommend-id="image://fa483da7085491d97a72ceebebb51ee2" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="A map screen from the game." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A map screen from the game." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Ryu Ga Gotoku Studio / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="fa483da7085491d97a72ceebebb51ee2" data-recommend-id="image://fa483da7085491d97a72ceebebb51ee2" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="A map screen from the game." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>About halfway through the game, you’re introduced to one of the other major threats roaming the waters around Hawaii: The Devil Kings. Once you beat their initial quest, all of their hideouts open up to be raided. It’s gonna be tempting, especially after the first too-easy ones to just take whatever’s available, and sweet baby Jesus you need to slow your roll, because the difference in difficulty from the early hideouts vs the four-skull ones is vast, without leveling up way above normal. If you’re gonna pump some time into that quest line, do yourself a favor and tackle them in order of difficulty, and don’t get too ambitious.</p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="fb6bc49bf51e53526a004dc3f8d68da0" data-recommend-id="image://fb6bc49bf51e53526a004dc3f8d68da0" data-format="jpg" data-width="1637" data-height="921" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Aiming a rocket launcher at another boat on the sea." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Aiming a rocket launcher at another boat on the sea." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Ryu Ga Gotoku Studio / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="fb6bc49bf51e53526a004dc3f8d68da0" data-recommend-id="image://fb6bc49bf51e53526a004dc3f8d68da0" data-format="jpg" data-width="1637" data-height="921" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Aiming a rocket launcher at another boat on the sea." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>It’s never really emphasized after the brief bit of tutorial in which it’s introduced, but <strong>the rocket launcher is one of the most underrated pieces of gear in your arsenal</strong>. Yes, it requires Majima leaving the captain’s wheel to fire, but given just how much range it has, using the rockets as a bespoke sniper rifle has more utility than you think, especially later on when you start seeing ships with depth charges, and distance is much more at a premium. By that point, as well, you should have Majima’s grappling hook, which gives you a grapple point on your ship up to the crow’s nest, where you can get an even better view.</p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="90f4470712c33e22defb091729fbbcf7" data-recommend-id="image://90f4470712c33e22defb091729fbbcf7" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="The whole gang gathered together on board the pirate ship." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="The whole gang gathered together on board the pirate ship." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Ryu Ga Gotoku Studio / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="90f4470712c33e22defb091729fbbcf7" data-recommend-id="image://90f4470712c33e22defb091729fbbcf7" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="The whole gang gathered together on board the pirate ship." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>The critical path of <em>Pirate Yakuza</em> will endear you plenty to your main ride-or-die characters like Jason, Noah, and Masaru, but as mentioned before, these are also the characters you’re gonna carry with you the entire game. As such, giving them priority attention above everyone else pays dividends like crazy. That’s not just because they have the best-written storylines, but they start out with such high stats that prioritizing them early generally means you can stick them in one position right from jump, and they’ll evolve faster the rest. For most of them, it means keeping them happy and fed while on the ship, and bringing them on raids. For Noah, that means taking in the optional conversations dotted around Honolulu early and often. For Noah’s tiger cat, Goro, though, that means visiting Nele Island just as early and often with the fancy pet food.</p><p>.</p></div></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Finally, the mobile hit’s developers have promised a major overhaul of the busted system, though the fixes could still take a long time to roll out and will destroy a currency players already wasted a bunch of cards farming for. </p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="196165" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="What’s Coming Out Beyond Pokémon: The Indigo Disk | The Week In Games" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="95" data-playlist="196165,196663,197298" data-current="196165"><div><p>What’s Coming Out Beyond Pokémon: The Indigo Disk | The Week In Games</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196165/196165_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196165/196165_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196165/196165_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196165/196165_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/21711.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>“Thank you for sharing your feedback on the trading feature in Pokémon Trading Card Game Pocket,” the team announced <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://community.pokemon.com/en-us/discussion/17262/trading-feature-update&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://community.pokemon.com/en-us/discussion/17262/trading-feature-update" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">in a new blog post</a></span>. “We’re continuing to read your comments and investigate ways to improve the feature.” The biggest change is that trade tokens, a recently introduced currency required anytime you want to trade, will be removed and converted into Shinedust which will be required for trades instead. </p><p>Moments of economic upheaval like this have become common in free-to-play games, but some fans who already destroyed a bunch of their one-star cards to farm the currency for future trades now feel duped. “Appreciate the Trade Tokens being converted to Shinedust, but I definitely feel like an idiot for stocking up on Tokens now,” responded one player <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://x.com/PokemonTCGP/status/1900351172700959147&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://x.com/PokemonTCGP/status/1900351172700959147" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">on X</a></span>. “I shredded a bunch of rare cards. Oh well…” Another was similarly disappointed. </p><p>“Oh people melting their 1* cards to get trade token while sitting on 100k shine dust and they lost nothing?” explained another. Not everyone is sympathetic. “If you traded a card in you didn’t have spares of, that’s on you man, idk what to tell you,” wrote a player debating the subject on the <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/PTCGP/comments/1jas52b/shinedust_is_the_new_trade_currency/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/PTCGP/comments/1jas52b/shinedust_is_the_new_trade_currency/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>PTCG</em>P subreddit</a></span>. Players who have been hoarding shinedust since launch, on the other hand, are quite pleased with themselves right now. </p><p>A future update will also let players publicize cards they want to trade for, streamlining the current clumsy process of needing to coordinate trades offline or risk blindly offering up a card with no clue what someone might offer to trade in return. Sounds great! Unfortunately, the timeline for both changes is simply by the end of “autumn 2025.” Huh.</p><p>The <em>Pokémon TCG Pocket</em> is also looking at changing the current restriction on trading cards rarer than one-star, perhaps the thing players have complained about most regarding the game’s trade system. Instead of being able to trade with a friend for the hardest-to-get card, many hardcore fans are limited to trading for cards they already have. </p><p>“We are also looking into how to accommodate cards that are currently unavailable for trades, such as promo cards and two-star rarity cards,” the developers write. “Keep an eye out for more information about this topic in the future.” Given that trade tokens aren’t getting nuked for another six months as it is, I’m not holding out hope for two-star trading anytime soon. </p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
