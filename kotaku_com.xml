Then on April 8, someone bought the device for $2,000, which the seller accepted. At the moment, that’s all we know. I reached out to Valve and the person who allegedly sold the Steam Deck prototype on eBay to see if I could learn more about the device or how it was acquired.

It appears to be missing a right joystick, too. Oh, and the label on the back mentions that this alleged prototype isn’t meant to be sold. Oops!</p><p><em>SteamDeckHQ</em> further reports that the seller claimed the prototype doesn’t have an OS installed and shared images of the device’s boot screen with more information about it. </p><p>Perhaps this is an elaborate fake.

But some of that rebalancing ended up leaking out into the full campaign, and overall many players felt the changes made the game’s <em>Souls</em>-inspired combat meat grinder feel way overtuned and unrewarding. Negative user reviews instantly started pouring in on Steam and pushed <em>Path of Exile 2</em>'s rating down into mixed territory. </p><p>“Every boss fight is incredibly longer than it needs to be. Most of the skills do little to no damage,” wrote one player reviewing the game on Steam. “I understand they said they wanted to slow game play down, but I don’t think I will even make it more than 1 week in this league at this point.” Another asked, “how do you have a relatively good first patch then wait 3 months nerf everything and make the campaign a worse experience?” Some fans on the game’s subreddit were similarly apoplectic.<strong> </strong>“I was going to take a day or two off work to play this game,” one <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/PathOfExile2/comments/1jrrn4y/jonathanmark_this_aint_it/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/PathOfExile2/comments/1jrrn4y/jonathanmark_this_aint_it/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">wrote</a></span>. “But I removed my vacation I had put in. I’d rather just go into work than play this game right now.”</p><p>Grinding Gear rushed into action with a <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.pathofexile.com/forum/view-thread/3746205&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.pathofexile.com/forum/view-thread/3746205" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">series of quick patches</a></span> to try and ameliorate the key pain points, including the new Huntress class being so reliant on a parry mechanic to be effective, as well as more basic complaints around crashes and server disconnects. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.pathofexile.com/forum/view-thread/3750853&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.pathofexile.com/forum/view-thread/3750853" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">A long list of balance changes</a></span> was outlined earlier today to go live across the rest of the week, including making a range of character skills more powerful. “Now that we have a lot of the nerfs out of the way, we can concentrate on buffing things that are not performing well,” the developers wrote. </p><p>In some ways, that sounds like Early Access working exactly as intended, though there are perhaps deeper philosophical issues underlying some of the ongoing community angst around each big new<em> Path of Exile 2 </em>update. Some of that has to do with a clear, overall effort to make a game that’s (somewhat) more approachable to get into than its predecessor, but also decisively more punishing.  Some of it has to do with the fact that people who still love and play the original<em> Path of Exile</em> feel left behind. That game’s next big season was delayed as Grinding Gear <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/path-exile-2-poe-1-league-date-roadmap-update-1851751502&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/path-exile-2-poe-1-league-date-roadmap-update-1851751502">tries to get a handle on the sequel</a></span>. </p><p>“I think a running theme with <em>PoE 2</em> in general is that the target to hit is smaller because if we want the combat to be more engaging, then that means there’s a smaller target; it puts more pressure on the balance to be right,” Rogers said during yesterday’s livestream. Some fans were critical of him for appearing “defensive” early on during the interview. He apologized toward the end of the chat and said he had just gotten up on the wrong side of the bed. Roberts added that he actually thought it was one of the duo’s more productive discussions about the game because they came out of it ready to launch over a dozen changes to get <em>Path of Exile 2 </em>back on track. </p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://kotaku.com/switch-2-nintendo-no-achievements-trophies-xbox-steam-1851775079<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>I love achievements in video games. I remember playing<em> Call of Duty 2</em> on Xbox 360 and getting my first one and thinking “Oh this is neat!” And over the last 20 years, I’ve grown to enjoy them more and more as they have become a digital  scrapbook documenting my gaming accomplishments across different platforms. Which is why I’m so sad that Nintendo, yet again, has decided not to implement an achievement system.  </p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="194644" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="The Week In Games: Return To Hyrule" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="165" data-playlist="194644,196626,196698" data-current="194644"><div><p>The Week In Games: Return To Hyrule</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/194644/194644_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/194644/194644_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/194644/194644_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/194644/194644_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/20101.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>When <em>Polygon </em>recently asked Nintendo vice president of player and product experience Bill Trinen if the Switch 2 would have an Xbox 360-like achievement system, he simply answered: <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.polygon.com/news/553774/nintendo-switch-2-no-achievements&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.polygon.com/news/553774/nintendo-switch-2-no-achievements" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">“Nope.”</a></span> It’s not surprising that Nintendo has made this decision as the company has avoided achievements for 20 years now, despite nearly every other video game platform and console implementing them in the meantime. Yet the way Trinen is so flippant in his answer rubs me the wrong way. It’s like Nintendo is too good for achievements or doesn’t seem them as useful. And that’s silly.</p><p>When done well, achievements can add an extra layer of replayability to a game. If you really love a game, it can be fun and challenging to work on getting every achievement. And in doing so, you’ll likely be forced to use weapons you never used before or experiment with mechanics you mostly avoided. A particularly tricky achievement might require some teamwork or planning. And that can be a blast in a game you already adore and now get to spend more time with.</p><p>Another aspect that I love about achievements is, as mentioned, the way they act like digital scrapbooks. Right now I can load up my Xbox achievements and see what I was playing in 2018. What games did I finish? What games did I spend a ton of time in, collecting everything? What games did I barely play? I can see all of that and more via my achievements, which act as an always-updating activity log that I can flip through years later. I can do this on Steam, PlayStation, and even my Android device for games that support Google Play’s achievement system. Meanwhile, Nintendo’s lack of achievements means I have to rely on each console’s limited activity tracking data to sort of piece together what I’ve played and done.</p><figure id="" data-id="32961b6e6a289329e8ee20b156016c57" data-recommend-id="image://32961b6e6a289329e8ee20b156016c57" data-format="png" data-width="831" data-height="868" data-lightbox="true" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Xbox / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="32961b6e6a289329e8ee20b156016c57" data-recommend-id="image://32961b6e6a289329e8ee20b156016c57" data-format="png" data-width="831" data-height="868" data-lightbox="true" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p> Devs have also been creating and implementing achievements and trophies for about two decades now, so it’s not like you’d be asking them to do much extra work. And I expect Nintendo would add their own fun spin to collecting achievements. Plus, the people who make <em>Super Mario</em>, <em>Pikmin</em>, and <em>Zelda </em>seem like they’d be able to devise some really creative challenges for you to pull off. </p><p> Look, if you don’t like earning achievements or trophies in games, that’s totally fine. I believe all platforms should let people turn that stuff off if they so desire. But for Nintendo to just ignore achievements entirely is strange. They can add a lot without really causing any problems. </p><p>Sadly, the Switch 2 won’t have achievements. Perhaps Nintendo will get around to adding this industry-standard feature in whatever comes after the Switch 2.  I hope so. It would be pretty dang cool. </p><p> .<br></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
