It’s a dangerous area, filled with bandits and Snorks. My first time setting foot outside the Army Warehouse was pitch-black, and a small horde of Snorks ambushed me from all sides. It was one of the most terrifying gun battles of my playthrough.

I was incorrect, though. You see, the Chemical Plant is filled with enemies, and due to the A-Life quirks, they continuously spawn. By the time I clambered through the upstairs window to open the Journalist’s Stash to acquire the Lullaby, two more bandit groups and another small horde of Snorks spawned and were fighting in the streets below.</p><p>But for now, let’s focus on acquiring the unique assault rifle. To get it, start by climbing up the truck outside the front entrance until you’re aligned with the second floor, then hop across to the awning hanging over the front door. From here, mantle over the windowsill and into the second-floor hallway. </p><figure id="" data-id="49a158058a2afcc068b6fe207ce8e65c" data-recommend-id="image://49a158058a2afcc068b6fe207ce8e65c" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="An in-game screenshot shows the Journalist’s Stash containing the Lullaby at the Chemical Plant." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="An in-game screenshot shows the Journalist’s Stash containing the Lullaby at the Chemical Plant." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->GSC Game World / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="49a158058a2afcc068b6fe207ce8e65c" data-recommend-id="image://49a158058a2afcc068b6fe207ce8e65c" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="An in-game screenshot shows the Journalist’s Stash containing the Lullaby at the Chemical Plant." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>You’ll end up in front of a locked gate leading to the first floor.
