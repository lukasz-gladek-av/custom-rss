              <p>In October 2024, Bungie was sued for copyright infringement by a fantasy author called Kelsey Martineau. He alleged that&nbsp;<em>Destiny 2</em>‘s opening campaign had heavily lifted from his own work that he’d previously published on his blog, complete with a Red Legion embroiled in an “unending cycle of warfare.” The infringing storyline, however, had since been “vaulted” by Bungie, meaning it’s been entirely removed from the game. Now, as <a href="https://thegamepost.com/destiny-2-red-war-lawsuit-ends-bungie-full-settlement-author/"><em>The Game Post</em> points out today</a> (thanks <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/fps/bungie-and-sci-fi-author-settle-lawsuit-over-alleged-plagiarism-of-his-old-wordpress-stories-for-destiny-2s-launch-campaign/"><em>PC Gamer</em></a>), Bungie and Martineau have settled the case and it will no longer go to trial.</p> <p>Martineau, who posted his stories under the name Caspar Cole, says that in 2013 and 2014 he wrote “an original work about a unique and captivating fantasy world,” as it was phrased in <a href="https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.laed.270889/gov.uscourts.laed.270889.1.0.pdf">the lawsuit</a>. This story featured a Red Legion, with a leader called Yinnerah who—he alleged—had a near-identical origin story and motivations as&nbsp;<em>Destiny 2</em>‘s Dominus Ghaul. They are both “urged, guided and assisted by outcast mentors (scholars) to overthrow their leaders to rise to power with the intentions of invading Earth,” both part of a Red Legion fought by rebels on Earth, and both seeking to focus on a hovering celestial entity “that houses strategic assets,” said the lawsuit. This last part refers to Martineau’s Tononob Station and <em>Destiny 2</em>‘s the Traveler hovering above the Last City.</p>

 <p>The lawsuit went on to list many other claims of direct similarities (some appearing more of a stretch than others), along with a claim that both narratives followed the same plot beats. Over the past year, Martineau has gone on to bring in further claims of infringement, including <em>D2</em>‘s <em>Curse of Osiris</em> expansion, and even the&nbsp;<em>Destiny Grimoire Anthology</em> books. Bungie, meanwhile, <a href="https://thegamepost.com/bungie-pushes-back-destiny-2-red-war-lawsuit/">tried to get the case dismissed</a> in December of last year with a filing that pretty much amounted to, “No we didn’t.”</p>

 <p>This ended up not working with the Judge, and was seemingly made even more spurious by Bungie’s attempt to sneer that Martineau had relied on fan-made content and YouTube videos to make his case. He had to do that, though, because Bungie had infamously <a href="https://kotaku.com/destiny-2-tossing-away-old-story-content-is-making-it-h-1848323271">vaulted the original storylines</a> in such a way that even Bungie was unable to go back and re-play it. It seemed that <em>Destiny 2</em>‘s code has moved on so much since its beginning was created, then destroyed, that it would be incompatible with the present version of the game even if it could be recovered.</p>

 <p>This ended up backfiring, given it also meant that <a href="https://thegamepost.com/bungie-access-destiny-2-vaulted-red-war-internally/">Bungie was unable to offer any footage of the original game</a> to counter Martineau’s claims, and eventually had to rely on the very same fan-made content and YouTube videos to demonstrate it hadn’t plagiarized the blogger. Not only was this rather humiliating given the company’s own comments, but it meant Bungie ultimately failed to get the case dismissed as it had originally requested.</p>

 <p>Now, about a year since the original filing,&nbsp;<a href="https://thegamepost.com/destiny-2-red-war-lawsuit-ends-bungie-full-settlement-author/"><em>The Game Post</em> has obtained court documents</a> that show a settlement conference took place last week, November 12, resulting in the matter being settled. “Negotiations were successful and resulted in the settlement of all claims,” said the paperwork. A further filing explained that the lawsuit was now dismissed without costs, which itself demonstrates a big climbdown from Bungie which had tried to seek legal costs from Martineau in its original attempt to dismiss.</p> <p>No details of the settlement are known, nor likely ever will be known, but it’s quite the remarkable result for a case like this. So many successful movies, books and games result in a lawsuit from someone claiming prior art, usually as a result of there being 8 billion people on the planet and so an extraordinary pool from which slightly overlapping coincidences can be found. These are usually either immediately settled just to make the complainant go away, or promptly dismissed by judges. The fact that Bungie tried to push back, but then relented, obviously doesn’t allow us to draw any solid conclusions, but it sure makes the whole ridiculous “vaulting” nonsense seem even more shortsighted.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/anker%E2%80%99s-3-in-1-magsafe-charging-station-falls-to-almost-free-charge-all-your-apple-devices-for-pennies.1355680/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Having multiple devices is convenient, but juggling separate chargers for each one? Not at all.</p>
<p>If you own a smartphone to stay connected, a smartwatch to track your fitness, and earbuds for listening to your favorite tracks on the go, you need a 3-in-1 charger that can juice all these essentials up in one go, and not make a mess while it’s at it. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5632/">The Anker MagGo 3-in-1 charging station does exactly that for Apple devices, and it’s now going for less on Amazon.</a></p>
<p>This compact, but powerful charger is currently sitting at $70, after a nice 37% discount. The deal is open to both Prime and non-Prime members, but it’s only going to be around for a few more hours. If you’ve been wanting to grab a no-fuss charging solution, now is the time to make the move.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5632/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Ultra-Fast Charging for All Your Essentials</h2>
<p>You’ll enjoy Qi2-certified, 15W ultra-fast wireless charging, which is twice as fast as the standard 7.5W chargers most people still use. For reference, it can juice an Apple Watch Series 9 to 48% in just 30 minutes. That means you can drop it on the stand while you’re getting ready, and by the time you’re about to head out, your watch will be charged and good to go. Powering your AirPods will be just as fast, and you can also use the anti-slip pad to charge other earbuds, regardless of the brand.</p>
<p>The stand is structured like a minimalist tech tree, meaning you don’t have to worry about overlapping or constantly repositioning devices. You can place your phone vertically or even flip it horizontally to use it as a clock or calendar while it charges.</p>



<p>As for compatibility, it works well with almost the entire Apple ecosystem. The charger supports MagSafe-equipped iPhones, including the iPhone 13, 14, and 15 series. Apple Watch Series 1 through Series 9, plus Apple Watch SE and the rugged Ultra 1 and 2 should work fine too. Audio-wise, the base charging pad is designed for AirPods Pro 1 and 2, as well as any wireless earbuds with a wireless charging case.</p>
<p>The box includes the Anker MagGo 3-in-1 Charging Station, a 40W USB-C wall charger, and a 5-foot USB-C to USB-C cable. Just note that the discount is a limited-time one, so it’s best to grab it fast.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/gopro-dumps-hero-13-black-bundle-with-2-batteries-and-hand-grip-now-goes-for-pocket-change-2000644771</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/gopro-dumps-hero-13-black-bundle-with-2-batteries-and-hand-grip-now-goes-for-pocket-change.1355674/</guid>

              <p>Action cameras require accessories to actually function in the real world, so purchasing a GoPro by itself leaves you with an expensive paperweight until you grab batteries, mounts, and storage. This <strong>Hero 13 Black bundle solves that with two Enduro batteries, a floating hand grip, adhesive mounts, a 64GB microSD card, and a carrying case all in one package</strong>.</p>
<p>The good news is that<a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5633/"> the complete bundle just dropped to $369 on Amazon for Black Friday (down from $479)</a>, somehow coming in below the price of buying the Hero 13 Black camera alone at its regular $429. You’re <strong>getting $500 worth of gear for $110 less</strong> than it normally costs for the standalone camera.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5633/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Best Action Cam</h2>
<p><strong>5.3K resolution provides 91% more detail than 4K</strong> and an incredible 665% more than 1080p which means your footage will maintain detail in post even if you crop in or zoom in. Additional resolution also allows for digital reframing of your shot, giving a variety of camera angles from a single recording.<strong> Capture 24.7MP photos from video via the GoPro Quik app</strong>, ensuring you don’t miss a single photo opportunity by switching between modes.</p>
<p>Burst Slo-Mo records action at 13x slower than normal speed, <strong>the slowest slow-motion GoPro has achieved in their lineup</strong>. You can capture details such as water droplets, bike tire treads gripping dirt, or facial expressions during those extreme moments that occur too fast to perceive in real time. The 4x slo-mo mode works at full 5.3K resolution and offers slow-motion footage with great clarity and detail. These are types of slow-motion shots that used to require specialized high-speed cameras that cost thousands of dollars.</p>



<p><strong>Rugged and waterproof construction to 33 feet</strong> means you can take this camera into environments that would destroy phones or traditional cameras immediately. Mud, snow, rain, and underwater environments become accessible filming locations without protective housings or concern for damage. The water-repelling lens cover also serves to actively prevent lens flare and artifacts that ruin shots in wet conditions. You can go from skiing powder to swimming in ocean waves without changing gear or stopping to protect it.</p>



<p>The <em>Handler</em> <strong>floating hand grip prevents the camera from sinking in case you drop it in water</strong> and saves many GoPros from resting forever at the bottom of lakes and oceans. Its bright orange color is visible underwater and makes it easy to spot when dropped. The ergonomic grip delivers stable handheld footage without the camera shake that makes unwatchable home videos. For overhead shots or selfie angles, the grip doubles as a buoyant extension pole.</p>
<p><strong>Two Enduro batteries</strong> extend the shooting time significantly beyond a single battery that comes with standalone cameras. Cold weather hastens the drainage of batteries, and having spares means not missing shots during winter activities. Changing batteries takes a couple of seconds, so you’re never waiting hours for charging on active days. The performance of Enduro batteries in cold conditions is better compared to standard GoPro batteries, which maintain performance in temperatures that could cripple regular lithium cells.</p>
<p>The<strong> 64GB SanDisk microSD card is sufficient for hours of 5.3K footage</strong> before needing to offload files. Curved adhesive mounts stick to helmets, surfboards, cars, or any curved surface for stable POV shots. This carrying case protects everything during transport and keeps accessories organized instead of loose in a backpack. In fact, these included items would cost $150-200 if purchased separately which makes the bundle pricing almost absurd.</p>
<p>For $369, you get a complete shooting kit featuring the latest Hero 13 Black, plus essential accessories that normally cost a total of $500, thus paying less than the camera alone costs at regular pricing. The bundle gets rid of the hidden costs that frustrate new action camera buyers because they come to realize their purchase is incomplete.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Handheld gaming PCs have had a <em data-start="168" data-end="176">moment</em> these past few years. The Steam Deck basically kicked the door open, and then devices like the Lenovo Legion Go and the Asus ROG Ally walked right in behind it. They’re convenient, sure, and there’s something very fun about flopping on the couch and playing full PC games without the weight of a whole laptop. But at the end of the day, those handhelds are still pretty focused on gaming and not a whole lot else. If you want something that can actually do all the normal “computer stuff” <em data-start="666" data-end="671">and</em> play the games you want, a good gaming laptop still just makes more sense. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5631/">And right now, Amazon has a solid deal running on the Asus TUF F16. It normally sits at around $1,300, but it’s marked down to $950 at the moment—a nice $350 off.</a></p>
<p>Let’s talk specs for a minute, because that’s what really makes or breaks a gaming laptop. The TUF F16 comes with a 16-inch display in a 16:10 aspect ratio, and it pushes a Full HD resolution. The refresh rate tops out at 165Hz, which is great if you play anything fast-paced or competitive, and the response time clocks in at 7ms. It also uses Adaptive-Sync, which basically helps keep your games looking smooth by cutting down on screen tearing and random stutters. The bezels are pretty slim too, so you get a surprising amount of screen without the whole machine feeling huge.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5631/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Subtle Styling</h2>
<p data-start="1493" data-end="1738">The keyboard is full-size with a number pad—which you don’t always get on laptops these days. Asus also gave the WASD keys a gold highlight, which is a small touch but a fun one if you like a little flair without going full RGB explosion.</p>
<p data-start="1493" data-end="1738">Under the hood, this particular model is running an Intel Core i5-13450HX paired with an NVIDIA GeForce 5050 laptop GPU. You get 16GB of RAM and a 512GB PCIe Gen4 SSD for storage. It’s not a monster machine that will play every AAA title at ultra settings, but for the price, it’s more than capable. Indie games will be a breeze to run, and a lot of bigger-budget titles should run just fine at medium settings without you needing to sacrifice too much.</p>


<p data-start="2777" data-end="2997">Battery life is solid, too. The 90Wh battery supports fast charging, letting you go from dead to 50% in about half an hour. You also get a 100W USB-C port that can charge your phone or accessories, which is always handy.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/lego-cuts-christmas-tree-set-price-twice-in-a-week-now-selling-for-pocket-change.1355581/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>This LEGO Christmas tree has become Amazon’s best-selling toy over the past week, and it received back-to-back price cuts in seven days. The <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5554/">set just dropped to $26 from its usual $44 price and marks a 40% discount and a new record low</a> for this holiday season icon. <strong>Amazon sold over 60,000 units already</strong>&nbsp;which shows how people are jumping on this early Black Friday deal before inventory disappears. The 2-in-1 building option <strong>lets you construct either one large tree or two smaller trees</strong>, which gives you flexibility for different display spaces.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5554/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Holiday Classic</h2>
<p>The larger tree configuration <strong>stands over 11 inches tall</strong> which makes it substantial enough to serve as a tabletop centerpiece without dominating your space. Each tree comes adorned with miniature ornaments, candles, and a yellow star on top that captures the classic Christmas tree aesthetic. The LEGO designers nailed the proportions and details that make this recognizable as a Christmas tree rather than just a generic green structure.</p>
<p>The 2-in-1 building option is what separates this from single-configuration sets that limit your creativity. You can build one tall tree at 11 inches for a dramatic display, or <strong>construct two smaller trees at 9 inches and 6 inches</strong> to spread holiday cheer across multiple rooms. Families can split the pieces and build together, creating matching trees for different spaces in the house.</p>



<p>Build quality matches what you’d expect from LEGO with tight brick connections and durable pieces that survive multiple rebuilds. The green pieces interlock firmly enough to create a solid structure that won’t fall apart when you move it around your house. The <strong>ornament details use clever brick combinations</strong> that add visual interest without requiring hundreds of tiny frustrating pieces. The<strong> color palette stays traditional with greens, reds, and touches of gold</strong> that fit any holiday decor style.</p>



<p>The timing makes this <strong>perfect for early holiday decorating or as a family activity during Thanksgiving weekend</strong>. You can build it together as a group project that gets everyone involved in holiday preparations without spending hours untangling light strings or arguing about ornament placement. The set arrives ready to build with all pieces included and no batteries or electronics required.</p>
<p>At $26 for a set that normally costs $44, you’re getting legitimate holiday decor. You’re investing in reusable decor that brings joy every year instead of disposable decorations that end up in landfills, all while paying pocket change during this record-low Black Friday pricing.</p>
