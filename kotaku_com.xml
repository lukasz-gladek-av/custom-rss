              <p>Jim Ward, sometimes know as James Kevin Ward, was a voice actor and radio host, best known for providing the wonderful voice of&nbsp;<em>Ratchet &amp; Clank</em>‘s buffoonish antihero Captain Qwark. It was <a href="https://x.com/StephMillerShow/status/1998881395167604759">announced</a> last night (via&nbsp;<a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/news/2025/12/jim-ward-voice-of-ratchet-and-clanks-captain-qwark-has-passed-away"><em>PushSquare</em></a>)&nbsp;that he has died at the age of 66.</p> <p>Jim Ward was perhaps more recently most recognized as a co-host on the nationally syndicated talk radio program,&nbsp;<em>The Stephanie Miller Show</em>, but to video games players it’s almost certainly Captain Qwark who would first come to mind. The hilarious character, all bravado and little talent, was so deftly performed by Ward such that he was<em>&nbsp;just</em> likable enough to be both a glorious antagonist, then later a hilariously useless ally, across most of the series of games.</p>

 <p>However, Ward was recognizable in so many other games, as well as his many TV and movie roles (especially as Doug Dimmadome and Chet Ubetcha in&nbsp;<em>Fairly Odd Parents</em>). In 1998 he was the voice of Hector LeMans in&nbsp;<em>Grim Fandango</em>, became a regular in multiple <em>Star Wars</em> games, appeared as <em>FEAR</em>‘s Rodney Betters,&nbsp;<em>Diablo III</em>‘s Belial, as well as roles in&nbsp;<em>Metal Gear Solid 3</em>,&nbsp;<em>Batman: Arkham Knight</em>, and&nbsp;<em>BioShock 2</em>, among many dozens of others.</p>

 <p>Ward had retired in 2021, due to a combination of precocious Alzheimer’s and an extremely serious case of covid-19 that had left him paralyzed for months. After a slow recovery from the sickness, he had entirely lost his memory. (Rather wonderfully, despite this, he apparently would still perform voices and entertain his family.) This obviously meant <a href="https://www.playstationlifestyle.net/2021/05/12/ratchet-clank-jim-ward/">he was unable to reprise his role</a> for 2021’s <em>Ratchet &amp; Clank: Rift Apart</em>, where he was replaced by <span data-testid="hero__primary-text">Scott Whyte, but his voice has continued appearing in more recent games such as&nbsp;<em>The Elder Scrolls Online</em>‘s&nbsp;<em>Gold Road</em> expansion and last year’s remaster of <em>The Thing</em>.</span></p> <p>Ward’s death was publicly announced by his former radio colleague Stephanie Miller, who quoted from an email sent to her by Ward’s wife on December 10. “One of the saddest messages I have ever received,” she began, quoting, “<span>Our wonderful ‘voice deity’ as Steph anointed Jim Ward, passed away today at 10:45AM. Can you let Steph know? Thanks, Janice.”</span></p> <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">One of the saddest messages I have ever received from the amazing Mrs Jim Ward:<br> Our wonderful “voice deity” as Steph anointed Jim Ward, passed away today at 10:45AM.
