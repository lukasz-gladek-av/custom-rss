            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Good morning. I’ve got some great news for you. Today, yes today, is Friday. Tell everyone you know. Spread the word. Friday is back, baby. And on this wonderful Friday, I welcome you to the latest edition of Morning Checkpoint, <em>Kotaku’s</em> daily round-up of video game news and other stuff you might care about. Today, we wonder what happened to a good <i>Black Ops 7 </i>map, learn more about why <em>Hytale</em> is skipping Steam, and ponder high console prices.</p> <h2>Used Xbox consoles are going for some wild prices</h2> <p><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/xbox/comments/1pefqsl/dang_these_prices_are_getting_absurd/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button">Over on Reddit,</a> people are shaking their heads in disbelief at the state of used game console prices. In 2025, <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/store/collections/certifiedrefurbishedxbox">Microsoft is selling refurbished Xbox Series X consoles for $550</a>. In 2020, I bought an Xbox Series X at launch for $500. Microsoft is also selling used Xbox Series S consoles for $330. At launch, the smaller machine was just $300, and you could often get it for less if you found a deal. These are absurd prices, but also not surprising when you consider how expensive consoles are in 2025, thanks to various factors like tariffs, inflation, AI squeezing demand, and every company trying to grow profits.</p>

 <p>Regardless of why prices are so high, it sucks that this is the first console generation where PlayStation and Xbox machines are <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/xbox/comments/1kdmdw4/a_history_of_xbox_console_prices_at_launch_vs_4/">more expensive five years after launch</a>. And <a href="https://kotaku.com/black-ops-7-helldivers-2-lava-skyblivion-delay-2000650525#:~:text=SSD%20and%20RAM%20maker%20Micron%20announced%20it%E2%80%99s%20getting%20out%20of%20the%20consumer%20business%20to%20focus%20on%20manufacturing%20for%20companies%E2%80%99%20AI%20computing%20needs.%20%E2%80%9CThe">prices are likely to keep going up for new and used consoles</a>. I can’t wait to take out a small bank loan to buy a PlayStation 6.</p>

 <h2><strong>A popular <em>CoD: Black Ops 7</em> map has been mysteriously removed</strong></h2> <p><em>Call of Duty: Black Ops 7′</em>s first season is now live, and while it has added a lot of new content to the online FPS, it has also removed something: the fan-favorite map Blackheart. This was one of the original maps to launch with<em> Black Ops 7</em> and quickly became one of its most popular. But it’s gone now. Activision says it was removed “temporarily” from both private and public map pools as it investigates an undisclosed “issue.” The map will return in a future, but-not-yet-specified update.</p>

 <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">📢 Call of Duty: <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/BlackOps7?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#BlackOps7</a> </p> <p>Blackheart has been temporarily removed from both Public and Private map pools while we investigate an issue. It will return in an upcoming update.</p> <p>Details: <a href="https://t.co/rmpoklhguD">https://t.co/rmpoklhguD</a></p> <p>— Call of Duty Updates (@CODUpdates) <a href="https://twitter.com/CODUpdates/status/1996651809017045428?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 4, 2025</a></p></blockquote>    <h2><strong>Newly discovered fish species gets <em>Dragon Ball-</em>inspired name</strong></h2> <p>As spotted by <em>Dexerto</em>, a new small fish was discovered deep in the ocean near an island off the coast of Japan. And, likely due to its bright yellow markings across its body, the fish has been given the scientific name of Vanderhorstia Supersaiyan. Yup, this is a <em>Dragon Ball Z</em> fish. <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10228-025-01047-6">You can read more about the fish here</a>.</p>

 <h2><strong>Newly resurrected <em>Hytale</em> won’t be on Steam at launch</strong></h2> <p>Earlier this year, <em>Minecraft</em>-inspired survival game <em>Hytale</em> was canceled by Riot Games. <a href="https://kotaku.com/hytale-riot-minecraft-hypixel-revived-cancel-shutdown-2000645248">Then, in November</a>, the original creator behind the project was able to negotiate the rights back for the game, and now Hytale is back in development with some of the team that was working on it before it was canned. But when it launches in early access, you won’t find it on Steam.</p> <p><a href="https://hytale.com/news/2025/12/hytale-s-1st-faq">As explained in a new FAQ</a> on the game’s website, the devs are going to avoid Steam for a bit to focus on its existing community and improving the game instead of chasing “a flood of cold first impressions that could overcorrect the game’s direction.”&nbsp; The post clarifies that the team isn’t looking to avoid “bad reviews,” but I have to imagine that’s part of the reason the team is staying away from Steam until the game is in a good state. A game on Steam with negative or mixed reviews can be hard to overcome. I’ll be curious to see if more teams follow this move.</p> <h2>ICYMI:</h2> <ul> <li><a href="https://kotaku.com/fortnite-carter-wu-homer-simpson-nipples-skins-shirtless-2000650650">Nipples are now allowed in <em>Fortnite</em></a></li> <li><a href="https://kotaku.com/outer-worlds-2-rpg-inventory-weight-encumbered-2000650641">Oh no, <em>Outer Worlds 2</em> gave me what I wanted, and I hate it</a></li> <li><a href="https://kotaku.com/it-took-19-years-but-were-finally-getting-total-war-medieval-3-2000650612">Wow, 20 years later, <em>Medieval Total War 3</em> is happening&nbsp;</a></li> <li><a href="https://kotaku.com/new-banjo-kazooie-sequel-remake-game-built-in-dreams-impressive-2000650541">Wow, this fan-made <em>Banjo-Kazooie</em> game is rad</a></li> </ul> <h2>Watch This:</h2>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/microsoft-keeps-its-ms-office-pro-2021-at-84-off-black-friday-low-to-extend-cyber-week-deal-2000650924</link>
            <guid>1374511</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Cyber Monday and Black Friday are a thing of the past at this point, but if you didn’t get a chance to grab all that you wanted during the biggest sale of the year, all is not lost. We’re still spotting quite a few lingering deals across retailers, so whether you’re after a new laptop, the latest smartphone, a kitchen appliance, or a subscription, there’s still time to save.</p>
<p>Stacksocial, in particular, is being the most generous with its post-Cyber Week drops. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4845/">We just spotted it offering a lifetime license of the 2021 Microsoft Office Professional for Windows at a whopping 84% discount.</a> This brings the price down to just $35, from $220. It’s selling out fast, though. We recommend grabbing your sooner rather than later, as the offer could wrap up any moment now.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4845/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at StackSocial</a></p>

<h2>Ideal for Students and Work Professionals</h2>
<p>Note that this licensing type will be connected with your actual device, and not your Microsoft account. You will receive the redemption code with all the instructions immediately via email after your purchase, and you’ll have a week to set everything up. There are some system requirements you should know about before proceeding, as well. First, you should have Windows 10 or 11 installed, as the license is not supported on older versions. You’ll also need at least 1GB RAM, 4GB space available for hard disk formatting such as HFS+ (aka Windows OS Extended or HFS Plus), and a monitor with 1280×800 resolution or higher. Most latest systems already have all of this, but we still recommend double-checking before you proceed.</p>
<p>Office Professional 2021 includes Microsoft Office Word, Excel, PowerPoint, Outlook, Teams (Free version only), OneNote, Publisher, and Access; everything you need for work, creative, and personal use. Word makes it easy to create and edit documents with a whole bunch of useful tools built right in, while Excel offers an easy way to handle data on a regular basis. You’ll be able to create stunning, jaw-dropping presentations with PowerPoint, take quick meetings using Teams, and manage calendars or emails using Outlook like a pro. OneNote is a personal favorite because of how fun it makes creating notes and organizing them in a single place. You can create different notebooks for different projects, incorporate media content within those, and a lot more.</p>



<p>Students can use these helpful programs to create assignments and collaborate on projects. Work professionals will be able to track their deadlines, create presentations, and manage emails; the possibilities are endless. On a regular day, you’d pay around $220 to enjoy all these features, but thanks to this Cyber Week deal, you can do it for just $35 today. It takes $185 off the price of an all-in-one solution. Don’t confuse it with Microsoft 365, though, which is a subscription service that offers the latest Office apps and lets you use them on multiple devices. This one is more of a one-and-done purchase with the core applications. You also won’t be able to use the programs on multiple devices with this license.</p>
<p>Make sure you redeem the activation code within 7 days of your purchase, as it won’t be valid after that. This is also a great time to grab some other subscriptions for less. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4845/">For instance, Stacksocial is also offering Windows 11 Home and Pro at a massive discount, as well. But get your orders in quickly, because the deals are selling out fast</a>.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/sony-pushes-playstation-5-pro-at-its-black-friday-low-while-xbox-series-consoles-stay-full-price-2000650666</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>We’re now a full week out from Black Friday, but it looks like someone forgot to tell Sony. Amazon has the PlayStation 5 Pro on sale for $101 off. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6100/">This latest model of the console has recently been priced as high as $750, but for the holiday season, you can grab the system of just $649.</a></p>
<h2>The PS5 Has No Games</h2>
<p data-start="136" data-end="775">Alrighty, we all love to go online and make jokes. The recurring meme around the PS5 is that the system “has no games.” It’s become a tired bit at this point. When you step back from the jokes and actually look at what the console has to offer several years into its lifespan, the idea that the PS5 is starving for content just doesn’t hold up. While it would have been nice to have a more exclusives, the current library is anything but empty.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6100/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>The PS5 Has Tons of Games</h2>
<p data-start="777" data-end="1567">A standout title of this generation is Ghost of Yōtei. This visually striking and mechanically tight action game that showcases the PS5’s graphical and performance capabilities better than anything in its wake. Then there’s Returnal, a fast-paced third-person shooter with roguelike elements that blends frenetic combat with an eerie atmosphere reminiscent of classic Metroid titles. It’s challenging, stylish, and moody. Gotta love it. And of course, Astro Bot marks a triumphant return to the 3D mascot platformer, a genre we’ve been missing for far too long. This game is a charming, heartfelt celebration of PlayStation’s history, packed with creativity from start to finish. The game’s quality and infectious fun earned it the title of 2024’s <em data-start="1508" data-end="1526">Game of the Year</em> at The Game Awards—well-deserved.</p>


<p data-start="1569" data-end="2375">If you happened to skip the PlayStation 4 generation entirely, the PS5 becomes an even more enticing system. You’ll find a treasure trove of beloved titles waiting to be experienced for the first time, with some receiving enhancements specifically for Sony’s latest console. Games like The Last of Us Part I and The Last of Us Part II continue to dominate discussions about storytelling in video games. The first entry is widely regarded as one of the strongest narratives the medium has ever produced, while the second remains divisive—but passionately defended by many fans who appreciate its bold thematic choices. Regardless of where you ultimately land, both games offer emotionally charged journeys through a post-apocalyptic world that became iconic enough to inspire a major HBO adaptation. Worth checking out at the very least.</p>
<p data-start="2377" data-end="2801">For players who want access to a large back catalog without purchasing every title individually, PlayStation Plus Premium is an excellent gateway. The subscription grants access to hundreds of games spanning multiple PlayStation generations. You can dive into acclaimed modern titles like Control, Kingdom Hearts III, and Final Fantasy VII Remake, as well as older classics that shaped the platform’s legacy.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/jbl-clip-5-takes-another-price-drop-after-black-friday-to-clear-out-its-bluetooth-speaker-inventory-2000650863</link>

              <p>If you missed snapping up a powerful speaker with bold sound from a known brand during Black Friday, Amazon is offering another chance to save big.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6243/">We just spotted the ultra-portable JBL Clip 5 going for $57 at Amazon, after the retailer slashed 29% off its usual (and already affordable) $80 price tag.</a> This deal applies to the classic black model. If you’re looking for something with a bit more personality, several other options are going for less, too. The stunning red and the beautiful blue, for instance, are sitting at $60, after a sweet $10 discount. Even better, you’ll enjoy a three-month free trial of Amazon Music with your purchase, which is going to make vibing and jamming a lot more fun. The only catch is that the deal is selling out fast. If you’ve been after a reliable, lightweight speaker, now is the time to act before it’s too late.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6243/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Easy to Carry Around</h2>
<p>This portable speaker features a compact frame and includes a fully integrated carabiner with a much wider opening. Slip your fingers through to carry it around, hook it to your backpack, or just toss it in your purse and get going. Since it’s quite lightweight, it doesn’t add unnecessary bulk, either.</p>
<p>Of course, small size doesn’t mean average performance; this speaker punches well above its weight. There’s a powerful driver and passive radiator for bigger, louder JBL Pro Sound with deep, rich bass that brings all your favorite tunes to life. It’s great for energy-filled songs, plus catching up on podcasts on the go. You can even pair it with your laptop or phone while streaming shows for a room-filling, immersive audio experience. Installing the JBL app takes the experience even further by letting you choose between audio options, tweak sound settings, install the latest updates, and more. The speaker is quite strong on its own, but you can always pair two of these with Auracast for an even bigger setup. Planning to host a fun gathering this New Year’s? Ask a friend to bring theirs and enjoy your own mini concert right there in your backyard.</p>



<p>The party goes all night with Clip 5’s strong battery that offers up to 12 hours of playtime on a single. Running low, but don’t want to stop the music? Hit the Playtime Boost to add up to three more hours to your playtime. Translation? Non-stop fun all night (and the next day) long. You can take out on your off-road adventures without a worry. Speaking of off-road adventures, the speaker is made to handle all weather and environmental conditions. This exceptional durability comes from its IP67 waterproof and dustproof rating. A few water splashes by the pool or a couple of drops in the sand at the beach won’t hurt the functionality.</p>
<p>Altogether, if you’ve been after a power speaker in a portable design that doesn’t put a dent in your wallet, <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6243/">the JBL Clip 5 is a great option to consider. Amazon is offering it for just $58 today, making the upgrade much more affordable</a>. You’ll also get 90 days free of Amazon Music with your purchase, which gets you instant access to thousands of ad-free songs, ad-free podcasts, offline downloads, and more. It even offers one free audiobook from Audible’s large catalog every month. After the free trial, your subscription will continue at $11 per month ($10 for Prime members), if you choose to keep it.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/govee-offloads-its-smart-led-lights-at-a-record-low-the-cheapest-way-to-decorate-your-christmas-tree-with-music-sync-2000650849</link>
            <guid>1374367</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Is your Christmas tree missing a little bling? It’s time to add some smart lighting to brighten it up. Govee makes some of our favorite solutions out there, and we just spotted its smart RGBIC Christmas tree lights going for less at Amazon.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6242/">On a regular day, these lights would run you around $140, but the retailer just slashed the price by 36%, offering them for just $90 right now</a>. It’s the lowest we have seen them drop to in a long while. It was also originally a Black Friday discount, which managed to survive the main event. You’ll enjoy free delivery on your purchase, which ultimately brings the total down even further. Snap it up quickly, though. Christmas is just around the corner, and we’re expecting these lights to be a popular pick, so both the discount and the stock could run out soon.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6242/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>16 Million Colors to Choose From</h2>
<p>The box includes 24 string lights, with a total of 480 LED beads. Each line is 6.6ft long and features 20 LEDs, making it great for most trees from 6.5ft to 8ft. There’s an 11.5ft power line attached, which allows you to place the lights anywhere without feeling limited. Installation couldn’t be simpler. The lights come with everything you need to put these up, including mounting rings, bar support, cable ties, and U-shaped straps.</p>
<p>Once up, the upgraded LED design, paired with the densely arranged beads, makes for a much smoother, uniform lighting effect. You can choose from 16 million color options (you read that right), plus over 60 versatile preset modes that have something appropriate for every occasion. If you already have a vision in mind, go DIY using the dedicated app, picking your own colors and styles. You can overlap layers, draw a sketch on the app to get specific patterns on the lights, edit patterns, or share your ideas with the AI bot to create unique effects. Don’t have the time for all of that? The preset modes make it easy to choose one within seconds. The Christmas lighting show, for instance, is bright and offers a nice mix of holiday-appropriate colors. Similarly, the “New Year’s” mode is a bit more vibrant, while the “Winter Warm” option brings cozy energy into your space.</p>



<p>The timer section in the app lets you create specific schedules for your lights. There’s a Sleep option to dim them, and a Wake Up to turn them on gradually. What’s more, the lights can also turn on when you clap your hands. Turn it into a game and see who can light them all up in the shortest time!</p>
<p>There’s a lot more to like about these smart lights that can be used for multiple events. You can pick from a range of colors and preset modes, which means you’re no longer stuck with the basic yellow lighting. Maybe go for something bright during the day, and switch to warmer tones at night; the possibilities are endless.<a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6242/"> Amazon is now letting you grab them for just $90, after taking a whopping 36% off their retail price.</a> Make sure you act fast to grab them, because we’re not expecting the discount or the stock to last long. That said, there are plenty of other lighting solutions by Govee going for less, as well. Now is a great time to stock up on everything you’ve had your eyes on, before the prices shoot back up.</p>

              <p>Tim Cain, the legendary developer behind 1997’s seminal RPG <em>Fallout</em>, has withdrawn from his semi-retirement to return to his former haunt, Obsidian Entertainment, as a full-time employee. In a video posted to his popular YouTube channel, Cain explains that he’d moved back to Southern California to rejoin the studio, and is already at work on new projects.</p> <p>Cain’s legacy in video games is deeply enviable. Not only did the <a href="https://chocolateihaveknown.wordpress.com/">dark chocolate-loving developer</a> blast out of the gate with credits on ’90s classics like <em>Stonekeep&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Star Trek: Starfleet Academy</em>, but almost immediately hit a home run with his leading role on the all-time great RPG, 1997’s&nbsp;<em>Fallout</em>. Since then, he project led the fantastic (and fantastically named) <em>Arcanum: Of Steamworks &amp; Magic Obscura</em>, was a senior programmer on the sublime&nbsp;<em>Vampire: The Masquerade – Bloodline</em>, and was co-director of Obsidian’s 2019 hit,&nbsp;<em>The Outer Worlds</em>. Along the way, he had a hand in <i>The Temple of Elemental Evil</i>, <em>South Park: The Stick of Truth</em>, and <em>Pillars of Eternity.</em></p>

 <p>In the video, Cain really buries the lede about his return to Obsidian after leaving in June 2020, making sure to first inform viewers of the squirrel that bullies him out of walnuts every time he enters his new home. But that more important detail out of the way, Cain explains that he’s fully back at RPG specialists Obsidian, full-time, and in the office, after having contributed work to the recently released <em>The Outer Worlds 2</em> remotely as a contractor.</p>  <p>There’s no word yet on which projects Cain might be working on at the studio, but given the only game we know currently in development is <em>Grounded 2</em>, it’s probably a secret. Here’s hoping for <em>Avowed 2</em>, of course, or even a straightforward isometric&nbsp;<em>Pillars</em> follow-up, given that’s Cain’s specialty.</p>
