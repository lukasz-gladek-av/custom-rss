            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        <p>Every search for life begins with a search for water, and while <em>Enshrouded</em> has certainly been lively since its January 2024 launch, its new aquatic update is about to take it to entirely new levels of mindblowing gameplay.&nbsp;<a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5280/"><em>Wake of the Water</em></a>, the biggest update yet to the enormously popular Steam survival RPG, adds so much depth and so many new elements and features that even seasoned <em>Enshrouded</em> players will feel like they’re playing an entirely new game.</p>


<p>Rivers flowing and waterfalls surging with dynamic voxel water are the newest features in the realm of Embervale, and they aren’t just pretty backgrounds. The new water biome is dynamic and completely interactive – swim, collect it, use it to grow food and to terraform the world around you. But, be alert — with this new aquatic element comes new amphibious enemies that you must defeat, or perish while trying.</p>
<h2>An Incredible Detailed Layer</h2>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5280/">As you explore the new world that&nbsp;<em>Wake of the Water</em> brings to&nbsp;<em>Enshrouded</em></a>, you’ll quickly learn to become one with the water. Swimming and diving will be new skills to master, long with using your grappling hooks underwater. Beneath the surface lie chests to open and plants to harvest, while back on land you’ll learn how to enhance your base with water dispensers, rain barrels, and hydro-powered mills to process food or forge new materials.</p>
<p>When you discover the new Veilwater Basin biome, you’ll be sucked in for hours of incredible exploration. Hidden ruins, valuable gold ore and aquamarine to mine, capybaras and wildbeast crabs to observe, and settlements that strange lizard people call home will be revealed. But so will the Drak, a dangerous new amphibious enemy that claims the Veilwater Basin as their own and will be all too eager to lure you into battle in the water, where their amphibious nature gives them a huge advantage that you’ll need to adjust to quickly or be defeated.</p>

<h2>Learn New Survival Skills</h2>
<p>Although the new depths of <em>Wake of the Water</em> present new challenges and danger in the form of the Drak, they are also a new source of sustenance — provided you’re able to master the rod and reel. As you encounter a new survivor selling gear and bait, soon you’ll progress through five different fishing rods and a variety of bait, including worms, moths. fireflies, and frogs. Your prizes come in the form of three common tiers of fish and 5 epic tiers, and as your talent in these mini-games grows, so do your rewards: loot bags, legendary weapons, trophies, and more. The fish themselves can be turned into meals that improve your stamina, mana, and your diving time and ability.</p>
<h2>Prepare for Battle</h2>
<p>Lest you think&nbsp;<em>Wake of the Water</em> is a peaceful and relaxing update to&nbsp;<em>Enshrouded</em> where you just hang out and fish all day, you’ll quickly find that the combat aspect of the game is turned up significantly. There are over 60 new weapons, most notably an entire new class of weapons called greatswords. Seven new armor sets and over 10 new fighting skills are unveiled in&nbsp;<em>Wake of the Water.&nbsp;</em></p>
<p>The combat overhaul with this update also rebalances the fighting statistics — elemental weapons now always inflict elemental damage, gem slots are increased in importance, and the fighting user interface has been overhauled and improved. You’ll need to obtain and master these new weapons and skills quickly, because the danger from the Drak and other enemies is an ever-present peril in this new world.</p>

<h2>A Great Game Redefined</h2>
<p>Gamers know that an “update” can mean anything from a virtually undetectable patch to a complete teardown and rebuild that can either make a middling game incredible or ruin a favorite game for good. <em>Wake of the Water</em> is the rare update that takes an already great game and adds elements and layers and features that create immersive new experiences while keeping in place the features that drew you to it in the first place.</p>

<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5280/">The November 10 drop of <em>Wake of the Water</em></a> fully redefines how you’ll play&nbsp;<em>Enshrouded</em>, with features like fully submerged bases, new skills like swimming and fishing, and lethal new enemies and the all-new weapons you use against them. It’s an exciting new era of&nbsp;<em>Enshrouded</em>, leading into 2026 when the game makes the jump from Steam and PC Early Access to a console and PC launch in 1.0. The possibilities are endless as the realm of Embervale is transformed by the engrossing aquatic elements of <em>Wake of the Water</em>.</p>
