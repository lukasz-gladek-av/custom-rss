              <p>The case between Rockstar and fired <em>Grand Theft Auto 6</em> developers who were unionizing gets messier. Discord is secretly preparing for a possible IPO. And Square Enix might ban you if you share <em>Dragon Quest 7 Reimagined</em> spoilers. It’s the latest edition of Morning Checkpoint, <em>Kotaku</em>‘s daily roundup of gaming news and culture.</p> <p>I’m trying to go into this new year by once again <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/coreybrickley.bsky.social/post/3mbtmvsb7xs2l">limiting my social media intake</a>. There are a lot of cool things that get shared around and I love to see, and also too much of anything will kill you. Curated feeds. Strict time limits. This is the way.</p>

 <h2>Discord is getting closer to an IPO</h2> <p>Bloomberg reports that the gaming chat platform “filed confidentially for an initial public offering.” While that doesn’t guarantee it will move forward with a Wall Street stock offering, it does suggest the company has moved <a href="https://kotaku.com/discord-reddit-ipo-gaming-server-gta-6-enshitification-1851768033">another rung up the ladder toward enshittification</a>. Discord recently boasted over 200 million monthly users and has promised to remain a user-first enterprise that doesn’t monetize its audience for short-term gain. We’ll see!</p>

 <h2>Rockstar shares new details about the unionizing <em>GTA 6</em> developers it fired</h2> <p>Claims were heard from both sides at a labor tribunal this week, <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/union-asks-judge-to-grant-fired-gta-6-devs-interim-relief-at-preliminary-tribunal-hearing-rockstar-denies-claims"><em>IGN</em> reports</a>. Rockstar also shed more light on the union-focused Discord that developers <a href="https://kotaku.com/grand-theft-auto-6-union-firing-rockstar-protests-2000646881">were chatting in before they were fired</a>.&nbsp;“This channel contained at least 25 non-Rockstar employees, including employees of competitor game developers, a video games industry journalist, as well as dozens of anonymous, unidentifiable members,” the company said in a statement to <em>IGN</em>.&nbsp;“Meanwhile, employees who posted union-supportive messages, but who did not breach confidentiality policies, were not dismissed.”</p>

 <p>While the IWGB has claimed only union business was discussed, Rockstar maintains that game features were also leaked. “We regret that these dismissals were necessary; however, confidentiality is fundamental to everything Rockstar Games does,” its new statement continued. “Global interest in our games is unparalleled.”</p>

 <p>Rockstar went on, “Even the smallest leak of any information relating to our products and practices can cause major commercial and creative damage — as we have seen in the past — and damage the experience of our loyal players and dedicated team. This was never about union membership. We have always taken a zero-tolerance approach to unauthorized releases of information — and we always will.”</p>

 <h2>The free <em>Dragon Quest 7 Reimagined</em> demo is out</h2> <p>Players will get an in-game reward for trying it, and save progress carries over to the final game which is out on console and PC on February 5. Be careful, though, as <a href="https://automaton-media.com/en/news/square-enix-bans-posting-certain-parts-of-dragon-quest-7-reimagined-for-a-month-after-the-demos-launch-with-strict-guidelines-on-spoilers/"><em>Automaton</em> reports</a> that Square Enix is threatening to ban anyone who potentially posts <a href="https://www.dragonquest.jp/guideline/dq7r/">unmarked spoilers</a> for the remake of 25-year-old game. The spoiler warnings will continue until morale improves.</p>

 <h2><em>Fallout</em> season 3 starts filming in just a few months</h2> <p>Amazon is wasting no time getting the next batch of episodes for its hit TV adaptation of the RPG series going. According to a <a href="https://productionlist.com/filming-may-frederick-e-o-toye-direct-upcoming-series-fallout-season-3-santa-clarita-ca-united-states/">new production alert</a>, filming will resume in May.</p> <h2><em>Balatro</em> and <em>Silksong</em> prove conventional wisdom can’t always predict hits</h2> <p>That’s one of the points NYU professor Joost van Dreunen made in a recent interview <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/nobody-wants-ai-slop-joost-van-dreunen-on-the-future-of-ai-and-the-shifting-economics-of-the-games-industry">with <em>GamesIndustry.biz</em></a>. “The success of a <em>Balatro</em>, a <em>Silksong</em>: These are all games that shouldn’t really exist,” he said. “They don’t make rational sense financially, and yet somehow they are deeply loved and commercially very viable and popular.”</p> <h2>ICYMI:</h2> <ul> <li><a href="https://kotaku.com/xbox-game-pass-resident-evil-village-star-wars-outlaws-2000657166">Some big blockbusters are headed to Xbox Game Pass this month</a></li> <li><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-red-blue-remake-logan-paul-firered-leafgreen-2000657176">What Logan Paul doesn’t get about Pokémon</a></li> <li><a href="https://kotaku.com/fantasy-fps-where-you-shoot-skeletons-to-stop-the-game-from-crashing-looks-incredible-2000657233"><em>FPS Quest</em> is a neat-sounding game with an incredible trailer</a></li> </ul> <h2>Watch this:</h2>

              <p>A father visiting <a href="https://kotaku.com/disney-world-fourth-death-in-one-month-disneyland-2000641756">Disneyland</a> with his family was reportedly attacked after calling out someone cutting a long ride line. The father ended up bloodied and received stitches, but was able to stay in the park and enjoy some rides.</p> <p>On December 30, <a href="https://people.com/father-injured-in-bloody-disneyland-altercation-over-reported-line-cutting-11880120">as reported by <em>People</em></a> and confirmed by Disney and Anaheim police, a family started cutting the long line for the Indiana Jones Adventure ride at around 2 p.m. At one point, the family of line cutters tried to pass by another family, but the father of this group didn’t appreciate this, and a loud argument erupted. This argument allegedly turned into a physical assault, with the man leading the group of line cutters punching the father multiple times in front of his wife and 17-year-old daughter.</p> <p><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Disneyland/comments/1q06z6f/comment/nxzj3zp/">According to one Reddit user</a> who claimed to have witnessed the attack, it lasted about 30 seconds and “there were several people intervening to stop the guy.” The same user claimed the attacker “managed to get some hits in even with people blocking.” The aggressive line cutter then reportedly stopped, and when people backed off, he “jumped in for one last sucker punch, which drew blood, and then he ran off with his family following.”</p>

 <p>A Disneyland spokesperson confirmed with <em>People</em> that on January 6, a&nbsp; “physical altercation” involving two male guests did occur, and one of them was treated by the park’s medical team. The alleged attacker “fled the scene and has not been located,” according to local police.</p>

 <p>A woman on Reddit claiming to be the wife of the man who was attacked says that he didn’t fight back because he didn’t want to get his family kicked out of the park or be charged with assault. The wife also says her teen daughter recorded the entire incident. As for the father, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Disneyland/comments/1q06z6f/comment/nx4gqzl/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button">a photo shared by the wife</a> shows him with multiple stitches above his right eye. It was also reported that he was covered in blood, and Disneyland provided new clothes while also giving his kids, 17 and 26, Lightning Lanes for the entire day.</p>

 <p>The father and his family stayed in the park, and another image shared by someone claiming to be the daughter <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Disneyland/comments/1q0pyhn/comment/nx4hy4d/?context=3&amp;utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button">showed the father in line at Disney with a bandage over his eye.</a></p>

              <p><span>Razer, the company best known for its RGB-infused keyboards, cat-ear headsets, and over-priced gaming chairs, has just revealed that its “AI gaming copilot” Project Ava will be used in its latest invention: an AI anime waifu that sits on your desk, named “Kira.” She’ll be powered by Elon Musk’s Grok.</span><span><br> </span><span><br> </span><span>The 2026 Consumer Electronics Show kicked off in Las Vegas this week and, unsurprisingly, AI-powered tech is everywhere. Razer announced its </span><a href="https://www.theverge.com/24338016/razer-project-ava-ai-gaming-copilot-coach"><span>AI gaming assistant, Project Ava,</span></a><span> at last year’s show, alongside a prerecorded video of the copilot program suggesting tips to help a player navigate a boss fight in </span><i><span>Black Myth: Wukong</span></i><span>.</span><span><br> </span><span><br> </span><span>Razer’s Project Ava has now returned in physical form. The newly unveiled “AI Desk Companion” version comes equipped with a built-in webcam (which Razer states is for its “human-like vision” and “full contextual awareness”), a series of customizable RGB LEDs, a USB-C port, and, most notably, a “swappable” 5.5-inch-tall 3D holographic avatar.</span></p> <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="fr" dir="ltr">Razer Holographic AI Voice Assistant Kira (Project Ava) CES 2026 Demo <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/Razer?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#Razer</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/CES2026?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#CES2026</a> <a href="https://t.co/ah54Us7QMJ">pic.twitter.com/ah54Us7QMJ</a></p> <p>— Shacknews (@shacknews) <a href="https://twitter.com/shacknews/status/2008539048328171561?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 6, 2026</a></p></blockquote>  <p><span>According to the press release, Project Ava’s holographic companion currently comes in five varieties. These include the default, amorphous green blob Ava, the aforementioned cat-ear wearing anime waifu Kira, and a buff “gaming wingman” called Zane. </span><span><br> </span><span><br> </span><span>The other two holograms are actually 3D recreations of real people: the South Korean eSports legend Lee “Faker” Sang-hyeok and the J-Pop idol Saori “Sao” Araki, the latter of whom exploded in popularity last year following her viral “Office Lady” meme.</span></p>

 <p><span>As detailed in a report by </span><a href="https://www.inverse.com/gaming/sony-razer-project-ava-ai-gameplay"><i><span>Inverse</span></i></a><span>, the physical version of Project Ava will be powered by xAI’s Grok, which recently </span><a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/crrn054nxe7o"><span>started posting CSAM online</span></a><span>. If you’re curious how it will perform as Grok races </span><a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2026-01-07/musk-s-grok-ai-generated-thousands-of-undressed-images-per-hour-on-x"><span>to seed social media with deepfake porn</span></a><span>, several outlets, including </span><a href="https://gizmodo.com/razer-made-its-ai-gaming-assistant-into-a-waifu-hologram-2000705679"><span>both </span><i><span>Gizmodo</span></i></a><span> and </span><a href="https://www.theverge.com/tech/854705/razer-ai-anime-waifu-hologram-desk"><i><span>The Verge</span></i></a><span>, were less than complimentary about its implementation.</span><span><br> </span></p>

 <p><i><span>Gizmodo’s </span></i><span>James Pero stated that his experience with Project Ava was “as wonky as chatting with any other AI chatbot out there,” and </span><i><span>The Verge’s</span></i><span> Antonio G. Di Benedetto noted that the anime AI assistant Kira “kept incessantly filling gaps in communication with annoying chatter.”</span><span><br> </span><span><br> </span><span>If you’re still keen to get your hands on one of these regardless, </span><a href="https://www.razer.com/gb-en/concepts/project-ava"><span>the FAQ</span></a><span> on Razer’s Project Ava website states that it’s “expected to be available in the second half of 2026” and that folks in the United States can already reserve one of the units by putting down a $20 deposit. The company still hasn’t revealed how much the full Grok-powered holograms will cost.</span></p>
