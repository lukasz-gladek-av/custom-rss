              <p>It‚Äôs Tuesday, but it feels like Monday thanks to Labor Day giving many of us the day off. But that weird feeling and a short week won‚Äôt stop the Morning Checkpoint. Today, we learn more about Ubisoft‚Äôs potential plans for <em>Rayman</em>, catch up on <a href="https://kotaku.com/tag/pax-west-2025">PAX West 2025 news</a>, and see how a group of modders is reviving <em>The Crew</em> after Ubisoft killed its servers last year. Also, another game gets delayed to avoid <em>Silksong</em>. And good news: The next Benoit Blanc murder mystery movie hits theaters this Thanksgiving.</p> <h2><em>The Crew Unlimited</em> brings the racing game back online</h2> <p>In April 2024, Ubisoft shut down the servers powering its 10-year-old open-world racing game<em> The Crew</em>. This made it unplayable, and that didn‚Äôt go over well with fans. In fact, <a href="https://kotaku.com/ubisoft-killing-games-the-crew-lawsuit-shutdown-offline-1851695302">the shutdown led to legal battles and a whole ‚ÄúStop Killing Games‚Äù movement</a>. Now, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/fan-made-the-crew-revival-gets-a-release-date-a-year-and-a-bit-on-from-the-ubisoft-racers-controversial-shutdown">as reported by <em>RPS</em></a>, the game that started all of it has been revived, but not by Ubisoft.</p> <p>Instead, <em>The Crew Unlimited,</em> a free mod for the PC version of the racing game, is being built and supported by a group of modders. The mod, which has been in development for about a year now, is set to arrive on September 15. The core of the mod is a server emulator that will let players essentially trick the game into thinking the official Ubisoft servers are still operating like it‚Äôs 2014. You can even, with some work, run the server emulator on your own PC, effectively giving players the offline mode they‚Äôve begged Ubisoft for over the last decade. (<a href="https://kotaku.com/the-crew-2-motorfest-offline-mode-servers-ubisoft-news-1851645034">And something which Ubisoft is adding to<em> The Crew 2</em> and its sequel.)</a></p>

 <p>While the mod looks like it won‚Äôt be the easiest thing to set up, videos of it in action look great, with the devs even making some minor fixes and tweaks to <em>The Crew</em> based on fan feedback. If publishers won‚Äôt help preserve video games, fans will do it. <a href="https://kotaku.com/so-called-pirates-are-doing-the-work-when-publishers-fa-1846533244">It‚Äôs been like this for decades, and I doubt anything will change soon</a>.</p> <h2>Another game has been delayed because of <em>Silksong</em></h2> <p><em>Silksong‚Äôs</em> surprise September 4 launch and $20 price tag have caused many other indie games to panic and flee the days around the game‚Äôs release date. And we can add another game to the list:<em> Star Birds</em>. This is the next game from the <em>Dofromantik</em> developers and it‚Äôs a colorful strategy management game based on a popular educational YouTube channel. <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2719750/view/538863491448046148?l=english"><em>Star Birds</em> was set to arrive on September 4, but will now launch six days later on September 10</a>.</p>

Reportedly, there are already ‚Äúpreliminary plans‚Äù in place for that sequel.</p> <h2>Capcom president blames PS5‚Äôs high price for soft numbers</h2> <p><a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/capcoms-president-says-high-price-of-ps5-has-contributed-to-low-sales-of-monster-hunter-wilds">As spotted by <em>GamesIndustry.biz,</em></a> in a recent interview, Capcom president Haruhiro Tsujimoto partially blamed the ‚Äúsoft‚Äù sales of <em>Monster Hunter Wilds</em> on the high cost of the PlayStation 5. While <em>MonHun Wilds</em> sold incredibly well out of the gate, becoming the fastest-selling Capcom game in the company‚Äôs history, the publisher‚Äôs most recent financial results called the game‚Äôs sales in Q1 2025 ‚Äúsoft.‚Äù According to Tsujimoto, you can blame that on the high price of a PS5 in most parts of the world.</p> <p>‚ÄúThe console costs about ¬•80,000 ($538). When you factor in the cost of software and monthly subscriptions, it comes to about ¬•100,000 ($672) at the time of purchase. This is not an amount that can be easily reached, especially for younger generations. This situation is not limited to Japan, but is similar overseas as well,‚Äù said Tsujimoto.</p> <h2>ICYMI:</h2> <ul> <li><a href="https://kotaku.com/borderlands-4-pax-west-rage-room-gearbox-2000621767">Our report on the <em>Borderlands 4</em> rage room at PAX West 2025</a></li> <li><a href="https://kotaku.com/silksong-demo-hands-on-price-hollow-knight-pax-west-2000621695">Hands-on impressions of <em>Silksong</em></a></li> <li><a href="https://kotaku.com/ff7-switch-2-remake-framerate-final-fantasy-2000622094"><em>Final Fantasy 7 Remake‚Äôs</em> intro is still amazing on Switch 2</a></li> </ul> <h2>Watch this:</h2>

              <p>Los Angeles‚Äô Anime Expo 2025 describes itself as North America‚Äôs ‚Äúlargest celebration of Japanese pop culture.‚Äù The 34th such event finished recently, with the four-day spectacular seeing an extraordinary 410,000 people show up, and it even played host to a Sukeban (the Japanse female pro-wrestling league) World Championship Fight. Also, of course, it featured squillions of attendees showing up in some superbly good cosplay. As ever, <em>Kotaku</em> heroes Minerablu were there to capture the very best fits.</p> <p>Given the anime focus, costumes obviously skewed that way, but gaming still got a look-in. Look, it‚Äôs not like it‚Äôs possible to stop at least&nbsp;<em>one Elden Ring</em> outfit getting into the gallery. (The really shocking thing is that there‚Äôs not a single person sporting an outfit from&nbsp;<em>Marvel Rivals</em> in this latest collection!) That does mean we get some superbly original stuff, including the most stunning Derpy from&nbsp;<em>KPop Demon Hunters</em>. I imagine the next few cosplay galleries we post are going to contain a&nbsp;<em>lot</em> more characters from that movie as the sewing catches up.</p> <p>So click on for the finest fits from Anime Expo 2025. And check back soon to see a video of the event, too.</p>
