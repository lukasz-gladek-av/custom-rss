Anyway, Emmrich, the older gentleman of the group is on the very bottom, which isn’t surprising given some cowards would likely view him as “too old” for protagonist Rook.

Most players chose to keep it, with 56 percent of players telling her to make that call. 44 chose to free the spirit in the end.</p><figure id="" data-id="e89b42209473075bc168e9cabdecdc1d" data-recommend-id="image://e89b42209473075bc168e9cabdecdc1d" data-format="jpg" data-width="801" data-height="633" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="A graphic showing the split between decisions in Bellara's personal quest." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A graphic showing the split between decisions in Bellara's personal quest." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->BioWare</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="e89b42209473075bc168e9cabdecdc1d" data-recommend-id="image://e89b42209473075bc168e9cabdecdc1d" data-format="jpg" data-width="801" data-height="633" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="A graphic showing the split between decisions in Bellara's personal quest." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="de79e91c59926e5b25cc24a270d20ff9" data-recommend-id="image://de79e91c59926e5b25cc24a270d20ff9" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Manfred and Emmrich clasp each other's hands while Rook stands next to them." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Manfred and Emmrich clasp each other's hands while Rook stands next to them." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->BioWare / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="de79e91c59926e5b25cc24a270d20ff9" data-recommend-id="image://de79e91c59926e5b25cc24a270d20ff9" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Manfred and Emmrich clasp each other's hands while Rook stands next to them." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>Jail.

While Outie Mark (Adam Scott) was under the impression that his wife Gemma (Dichen Lachman) was dead, Innie Mark knows she’s alive after seeing her photo because Gemma is the silently tortured Ms. Casey, the Wellness Counselor from the Severed building, who appeared in previous episodes. The only problem is, Innie Mark had already begun an office romance with Innie Helly (Britt Lower). Stiller says the second season will unravel the tangled web of this interdimensional love affair.</p><p>“Is Outie Mark going to find out that Innie Mark knows? And how is Outie Mark going to deal with that? At the same time, I think we’ve sort of developed a relationship with Innie Mark and Helly on the inside that feels like it’s going somewhere.

But, at what cost?</p><p>“The information that has come out into the world that Mark’s wife is alive—if that is actually something that people believe and follow up on, it would have ramifications, obviously, for Lumon going forward,” Stiller explains. “And if Lumon somehow gets exposed, what would happen to the lives of all these Innies who, basically, only exist in Lumon?”</p><p>Stiller will probably propose more questions for us to consider on his and Scott’s <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/severance-season-2-podcast-ben-stiller-adam-scott-1851710455?_gl=1*12ckg9k*_ga*MzQzNjkwNDM2LjE2NDY2NjQ1NzQ.*_ga_V4QNJTT5L0*MTczMzMzNDQ1Ny44Ni4xLjE3MzMzNDc3NTcuMTQuMC4w&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/severance-season-2-podcast-ben-stiller-adam-scott-1851710455?_gl=1*12ckg9k*_ga*MzQzNjkwNDM2LjE2NDY2NjQ1NzQ.*_ga_V4QNJTT5L0*MTczMzMzNDQ1Ny44Ni4xLjE3MzMzNDc3NTcuMTQuMC4w"><em>Severance</em> podcast</a></span> when it premieres on January 7, ten days before the show itself returns on the 17th. </p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

In fact, the fourth game in the franchise only imports three choices from <em>Dragon Age: Inquisition</em>, a stark departure from its predecessor which used a whole separate app to let you craft a world state based on hundreds of previous decisions. While that limitation lingers over <em>The Veilguard</em>, BioWare says this shouldn’t signal to fans that choices from games as far back as the original <em>Dragon Age: Origins</em> can’t factor into a future game.</p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="196742" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="What Is Dragonsplague?

The final game only implements three decisions specifically regarding the Inquisitor, the protagonist of <em>Dragon Age: Inquisition</em>. These choices mainly end up affecting a few lines of dialogue, and meanwhile, <em>The Veilguard </em>goes out of its way to avoid actually addressing anything else the player may have done in previous games. Every returning character’s dialogue is written in a way that they could have feasibly ended up where they do in the sequel regardless of whatever choices you may have made. Some minutiae falls through the cracks, like Isabela talking as if she joined the player in <em>Dragon Age II</em>, when it was possible to play that game without recruiting her. But broadly, BioWare chose to <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/dragon-age-veilguard-canon-choice-bioware-mass-effect-5-1851646112&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/dragon-age-veilguard-canon-choice-bioware-mass-effect-5-1851646112">take more care to not contradict players’ choices</a></span> than to represent them. This was a far cry from the studio’s previous work, and while I appreciate the care the team took to not step on toes, I think most fans were surprised to find something that felt so severed from previous games, especially as <em>The Veilguard</em>’s story ties up so many loose ends from across the franchise.</p><p>The studio has said that it planned on using the geographical distance between the events of the southern regions of Thedas in previous games and the northern setting of <em>The Veilguard</em> to get narrative distance. However, Busche explained to <em>IGN </em>that just because a decision from <em>Origins</em>, <em>DAII</em>, or <em>Inquisition</em> didn’t factor into <em>The Veilguard</em>’s story, that doesn’t mean it can’t be imported in a future game.</p><p>“The big thing for us is we wanted to make this story, every single choice you make, feel relevant to it,” Busche said. “One thing that we could have stated more clearly or maybe alluded to more clearly in the game is the idea that just because these choices from the past library of games didn’t necessarily impact this particular story, that doesn’t mean they’re gone. This is a chance for us to really key in to what matters with these events and what’s happening in Northern Thedas. I do fully expect that these choices going clear back to <em>Dragon Age Origins</em> will again matter. So just wanted to be on record with that. Every one of your choices that people have made throughout their <em>Dragon Age</em> journey, those are still your choices. And if you’ve seen the secret 2D ending we talked about, some of these events being quite pertinent. It’s easy to see how those choices can and will be relevant into the future.”</p><p>While a hypothetical <em>Dragon Age 5</em> is years away at this point, what we do know about the future of the series implies that old choices could be more relevant down the road. <em>The Veilguard</em>’s <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/dragon-age-veilguard-secret-ending-explained-executors-1851686439&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/dragon-age-veilguard-secret-ending-explained-executors-1851686439">secret ending</a></span> in particular has ramifications for the whole franchise, rather than just that game, so I could see BioWare circling around to older game decisions while plotting the series’ path forward.

Mattel issued a recall of the dolls but didn’t offer a refund. By explicitly advertising the toys to children aged as young as four, the lawsuit alleges the company neglected its duty to produce an appropriate product, packaging and all.<strong>&nbsp;</strong>While the toy giant didn’t directly address the lawsuit, it did argue that erroneously including a porn website on its packaging “in no way impacts the value or play experience provided by the product itself in the limited number of units sold before the correction.”</p><p>While Mattel appears to want to separate the packaging from the actual product, in terms of what the company is actually selling to children, there may be another way out of culpability.<strong> </strong>When you visit wicked.com, the first image you get is an age gate prompt that explains how the content on the page is restricted and only intended for viewing by those 18 years of age or older, with no pornographic images visible.

When I checked (for purely journalistic reasons), no advertisements flashed on my screen, and everyone depicted on the home page was fully clothed, even if they were scantily clad. It’s possible the child could have continued clicking through screens in search of <em>Wicked</em> content, and eventually stumbled upon the type of content her mother alleges she was exposed to on the site. But, this might be a case of principle vs practicality where, to the mom, the fact her child was directed to a site that contained pornography trumped the possibility<strong> </strong>that her child maybe didn’t “immediately” show her mom when she got on the site, as the lawsuit claims,<strong>&nbsp;</strong>and rather showed her mom the results of her going through the site on her own. </p><p>Even with the doll recall happening 11 days before the movie debuted, the Broadway adaptation still raked in <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://variety.com/2024/film/box-office/box-office-wicked-shatters-expectations-gladiator-2-starts-strong-1236221979/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://variety.com/2024/film/box-office/box-office-wicked-shatters-expectations-gladiator-2-starts-strong-1236221979/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">$114 million</a></span> at the box office in the United States alone in its opening weekend. With a <em>Wicked Part II </em>set to hit theaters next year, Mattel should definitely invest in a spell check to save itself any future legal headaches, and prevent the possibility of minors stumbling upon porn. Just a thought.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
