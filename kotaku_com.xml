We are currently investigating the issue and working to restore service, so please be patient.” It’s an especially unfortunate time for the network to go down with the <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://x.com/monsterhunter/status/1887911802853327236&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://x.com/monsterhunter/status/1887911802853327236" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">last free <em>Monster Hunter Wilds </em>beta test weekend</a></span> currently underway. </p><p>There’s no information yet on what the cause of the outage is, how many people are affected, or when the service might come back online. While some service disruptions can last for just a few hours, others could go on for much longer, with spotty connection quality even as the network comes back online. The PlayStation status page <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://status.playstation.com/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://status.playstation.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">currently lists</a></span> all online services as being down. </p><p>And so far this certainly seems to be one of the bigger outages PSN has suffered of late. Players started reporting getting disconnected shortly after 6:00 p.m. ET and so far there’s no sign of anyone being able to get back on. The outage also appears to be worldwide, rather than being isolated to certain countries or continents. </p><p>The nightmare scenario for Sony would be a malicious hack or some deeper problem that causes the outage to persist for days or even weeks. That’s been unheard of in the modern era, but that’s what happened back in the infamous 2011 PlayStation Network outage. So far at least, there’s no sign that something on that scale is happening again. Hopefully, the system comes back online shortly. I, for one, was supposed to be spending tonight with my buds in <em>Rocket League</em>. </p><p>.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

The card match was streamed online and the winner would receive a very rare gold Mickey card worth between $10,000 and $20,000. The winner would also move on to the Top 4 and have a chance to make it into the first <em>Lorcana</em> world tournament, so this was a big moment and a lot of people were watching. </p><h2 id="h4743"><a id=""></a>What happened during the event</h2><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.twitch.tv/videos/2369924180&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.twitch.tv/videos/2369924180" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">In the third and final round of the match</a></span>, Lentini “quested” with a magic broom card, gaining a point towards victory. Then he played Goat Merlin, a card that grants you a victory point for simply playing it. And then he went to banish his broom card to his discard pile because that card has an ability that lets you destroy it when you play another character and you then draw a card. That’s when his opponent, Fusade, complained and asked for a judge to step in. </p><p>Fusade’s argument was that Lentini had missed his chance to trigger the broom’s ability when he grabbed Goat Merlin’s point and moved on. If you’ve played <em>Lorcana </em>even casually you’ll know that is, uh, bullshit. In fact, in the official rules, simultaneous triggers can be handled in any order as long as you are clear with the other player. A longtime judge and <em>Lorcana </em>expert confirmed that <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://youtu.be/Mfpt3QNIsgc?t=305&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://youtu.be/Mfpt3QNIsgc?t=305" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">no rule was broken in a video with <em>Lorcana </em>content creator Joe “Speci” Curley</a></span>. In fact, as pointed out in that same video, Lentini did something very similar earlier in that same match which wasn’t flagged by the judge or Fusade. </p><p>That didn’t matter, however, because during the match the judge incorrectly sided with Fusade and made Lentini put his broom back on the board, not letting him discard it to gain a draw. This ended up costing Lentini the match and a chance to qualify for the world tournament. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://x.com/DisneyLorcana/status/1885969386676379884&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://x.com/DisneyLorcana/status/1885969386676379884" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Fusade then made it to the final match</a></span> and lost, but still qualified for the world final.

While it has yet to be confirmed whether Fusade was actually disqualified or just dropped out himself, based on how Ravensburger provided Lentini with a gold Mickey card, I think it’s safe to assume that Fusade was removed from the event.</p><p><em>Lorcana </em>is still a relatively new trading card game compared to <em>Magic </em>and <em>Pokémon</em>, so the community is happy to see this controversial situation be resolved in a mostly satisfactory way. The hope is that this is an indicator that Ravensburger is serious about protecting the game and the quality of its future events. </p><p> .<br></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

And <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/resistance-3-the-kotaku-review-5840845&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/resistance-3-the-kotaku-review-5840845">while 2011's<em> Resistance 3</em></a></span><em> </em>capped off the alternate sci-fi history about a WWII-style fight against alien invaders in the 1950s in a mostly satisfying fashion, die-hard fans have always pined for a sequel. Insomniac Games founder Ted Price recently said the studio wanted to make one too, but Sony wasn’t onboard. </p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="196181" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="The Best Reveals From The Game Awards 2023" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="180" data-playlist="196181,196653,195371" data-current="196181"><div><p>The Best Reveals From The Game Awards 2023</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196181/196181_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196181/196181_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196181/196181_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196181/196181_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/21718.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p> “We did pitch that one and it was a wonderful concept, and it just, in terms of timing and market opportunity, didn’t work out,” the outgoing studio head said when talking about the unmade <em>Resistance 4 </em>in <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWKbHKCUkpw&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWKbHKCUkpw" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">a new interview with <em>Kinda Funny Games</em></a></span>. The comments were made in the context of a conversation about how many games get cancelled or never even greenlit that people don’t hear about. </p><p>“[The pitch] was the result of a lot of Insomniac team members being passionate about extending the story further, because I do believe that <em>Resistance</em> has set up a really cool alternate history base where anything can happen with the Chimera and where they go and what their origins are,” Price said.</p><p>While the <em>Resistance</em> games generally sold well, Price’s mention of “market opportunity” could be a reference to <em>The Last of Us</em>,<em>&nbsp;</em>which came out a few years after <em>Resistance 3</em> in 2013. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0eQMwduYw9o&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0eQMwduYw9o" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>Sacred Symbols</em> host Colin Moriarty</a></span> previously reported that Sony was worried about overloading its portfolio with post-apocalyptic games, and <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.truetrophies.com/n19511/playstation-exclusive-insomniac-resistance-4-cancelled-sony&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.truetrophies.com/n19511/playstation-exclusive-insomniac-resistance-4-cancelled-sony" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">declined to greenlight <em>Resistance 4</em></a></span> because “it sounded too similar to <em>The Last of Us</em> and they didn’t want the two games overlapping with each other.”</p><p>But that doesn’t mean <em>Resistance </em>can’t come back again in the future. While Price, who directed the first two <em>Resistance </em>games, is leaving the studio, Sony now owns the IP and, assuming Insomniac remains busy with its endless slate of upcoming <em>Marvel </em>spin-offs, could potentially farm it out to another studio, either internally or outside of PlayStation. Price seems hopeful that, one way or another, the series might still come back someday. </p><p><em>“Resistance 3</em> was intended to end that chapter of the <em>Resistance </em>franchise with the way that we ended with [recurring protagonist Joseph] Capelli and closed a lot of loops on various story items, and we wanted to do that so we would have more options in the future whether we were to go ahead with more <em>Resistance</em> games or take another turn,” Price said this week. “When you work on a franchise for a long time, it’s nice to have a chance to move on to something else and at the same time it’s also nice to be able to come back to it. Fortunately, because we’re part of Sony and Sony owns the intellectual property to <em>Resistance, </em>we will always have that opportunity to revisit <em>Resistance</em> and if it works out again, as a fan I’m going to be pretty excited.”<br></p><p>At this point, many fans would probably settle for a simple remaster of the existing trilogy for modern platforms. Since the games released on PS3, the only way to play them on PS5 remains through cloud streaming as part of the PlayStation Plus Premium subscription tier. </p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
