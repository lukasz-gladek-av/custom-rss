              <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/2025-best-games-monster-hunter-split-fiction-avowed-1851767689">We got a lot of great games in 2025.</a> Some big, some small. But not every game released over the last 12 months was good. Some were meh. And others, well, others were downright terrible.</p> <p>As we’ve said before, the best games are only great if we can compare them to mediocre or awful games. And 2025 had plenty of these to choose from.&nbsp;So let’s take a look at some of the worst-reviewed games of 2025.</p> <p>But before we do that, it’s worth repeating once again that liking a “bad” game isn’t a <em>bad</em> thing. Numbered scores come with all sorts of caveats, which is part of the reason we don’t use them at <em>Kotaku</em>. And Metacritic’s aggregate isn’t perfect by any stretch. If you see a game on this list that you happen to love, don’t get mad, just smugly nod to yourself and remind yourself that the critics got it wrong.</p>

 <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/the-worst-games-of-2020-according-to-metacritic-1845913017?_gl=1*1906hd1*_ga*NzE0NzM5NTc5LjE3Mjk4Njg5MzU.*_ga_V4QNJTT5L0*MTczMzUwMTEyNS44NS4xLjE3MzM1MDg3NDQuNTcuMC4w">Now,</a> <a href="https://kotaku.com/worst-games-2024-metacritic-review-scores-funko-jjk-1851714921">as we’ve</a>&nbsp;<a href="https://kotaku.com/the-worst-games-of-2021-according-to-metacritic-1848234861?_gl=1*1ij1sdw*_ga*NzE0NzM5NTc5LjE3Mjk4Njg5MzU.*_ga_V4QNJTT5L0*MTczMzQxNDU4NS44My4xLjE3MzM0Mjg3OTguNDIuMC4w">done in</a> <a href="https://kotaku.com/the-worst-games-of-2019-according-to-metacritic-1840668824?_gl=1*66bxk9*_ga*NzE0NzM5NTc5LjE3Mjk4Njg5MzU.*_ga_V4QNJTT5L0*MTczMzUwMTEyNS44NS4xLjE3MzM1MTI4MDEuNjAuMC4w">previous years</a>, here are the <a href="https://www.metacritic.com/pictures/worst-videogames-of-2025/9/">10 worst-rated games on&nbsp;Metacritic</a> (they had to receive at least four reviews to qualify).</p> <h2>10: <em>Fast &amp; Furious: Arcade Edition</em> | 45 Metascore</h2>  <p>Even priced at $30, this budget racer port of a so-so arcade game isn’t worth it. You are better off dropping a few quarters into the original arcade version and playing for a few minutes of nonsense before realizing it has little to offer and moving on.</p>

 <h2>9: <em>Glover</em> |&nbsp; 44 Metascore</h2>  <p><em>Glover</em> is back. I’m so sorry. This port of the OG N64 platformer that someone liked, surely, isn’t much of an upgrade, and even if it was, this is still <em>Glover</em> we are talking about, folks. It’s lucky to make any list.</p>

 <h2>8: <em>Scar-Lead Salvation</em> | 44 Metascore</h2>  <p>Wait a minute, this game has the same metascore as <em>Glover</em>, and yet it is worse? Yeah, I’m ranking it below <em>Glover</em> as it has more reviews, so more people didn’t like this pricey and basic anime spin on a <em>Returnal</em>-esque roguelike shooter.</p>

 <h2>7: <em>Ambulance Life: A Paramedic Simulator</em> | 44 Metascore</h2>  <p>Oh, and look at that, one more game that landed at a 44 Metascore.<em> Ambulance Life</em> slides just below whatever the last game was because even more people played, reviewed it, and didn’t like its AI-generated dialogue, clunky gameplay, and ugly visuals.</p>

 <h2>6: <em>Tamagotchi Plaza – Nintendo Switch 2 Edition</em> | 43 Metascore</h2>  <p>This sequel to <em>Tamagotchi Connection: Corner Shop</em> falls flat on its face because it plays more like a bad mobile game than TKTK and it has some truly repetitive minigames.</p>

 <h2>5: <em>Gore Doctor</em> | 40 Metascore</h2>  <p><em>Gore Doctor i</em>s the first game on the list that I had never heard of before, and now that I do know about it, I’m happy to have avoided this horror game that is apparently a technical mess with terrible controls.</p> <h2>4: <em>Spy Drops</em> | 39 Metascore</h2>  <p>Someone wanted to make a stealth-action game like the OG <em>Metal Gear Solid</em>. Sadly, this game is bogged down by a lot of problems, including a bad camera, bugs, and brain-dead enemy AI.</p> <h2>3:<em> Blood of Mehran</em> | 38 Metascore</h2>  <p>Critics really disliked this <em>Prince of Persia</em>-like action game, with nearly every review calling it some form of terrible. Avoid at all costs.</p> <h2>2: <em>Fire Emblem Shadows</em> | 37 Metascore</h2>  <p>What if <em>Among Us,</em> but <em>Fire Emblem</em>? That was seemingly the pitch for this mobile-only Nintendo-published dud. Even the few good ideas are overshadowed by free-to-play garbage and a lack of content. I’d probably just play <em>Among Us i</em>nstead.</p> <h2>1: <em>MindsEye</em> | 28 Metascore</h2>  <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/mindseye-review-bad-ps5-update-boring-open-world-pc-gta-1851785108">lol, yeah that seems right.</a></p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/microsoft-practically-gives-away-windows-11-pro-at-94-off-plus-a-kotaku-exclusive-code-that-pushes-the-price-even-lower-2000653043</link>
            <guid>1383658</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>If you’ve been considering a PC upgrade, there’s no better moment than right now. Windows 11 Pro—Microsoft’s most up-to-date and feature-rich operating system—is currently being offered at an unusually steep discount. Instead of paying the typical $200 price tag, you can pick up a genuine license for just $10 through StackSocial. That amounts to roughly 94% off. It’s an appealing option whether you’re replacing an outdated OS or finalizing a new computer build, but it just got even more appealing. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4452/">We at Kotaku managed to score you an even better deal. If you use our exclusive discount code<strong> KOTAKU10</strong>, you’ll end up saving yourself an extra 10%.</a> Now, sure, that 10% works out to 99 cents. You might be thinking that pretty negligible, but that’s nonsense. Money saved is money saved. Get Windows 11 Pro for just $9.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4452/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at StackSocial</a></p>

<h2>Smarter Tools Designed to Boost Productivity</h2>
<p>One of the most helpful additions to Windows 11 Pro is Universal Search, conveniently placed right on the taskbar. This feature acts as a centralized search engine for your entire device and beyond. It simultaneously scans your applications, documents, photo library, and even the web. Doesn’t matter if you’re hunting for a PowerPoint file, trying to pull up a recipe you saved months ago, or quickly checking a location on a map, Universal Search streamlines the process. Instead of digging through folders or juggling browser tabs, you now have a one stop shop for anything you’d ever need to find in a single search bar.</p>
<p>Windows 11 Pro of course is built from the ground up for OneDrive integration. With OneDrive, your files stay synchronized across all your devices without any extra effort. Saving a document on your desktop means you can retrieve it later on your laptop, tablet, or smartphone. This cloud-based workflow is especially valuable for remote workers, students, and anyone juggling multiple devices. While OneDrive itself requires a separate subscription, the reliability and accessibility it offers make it a beneficial companion to Windows 11 that’s definitely worth dipping into.</p>



<p>The operating system also shines with its improved Virtual Desktops feature. By enabling Task View, you can build multiple customized desktops tailored to different aspects of your life. You can have one desktop dedicated to work, another for entertainment and browsing, a third for launching all your games, and perhaps a separate one devoted to creative projects. Each virtual desktop can sport its own layout, wallpaper, and shortcuts, helping you maintain organized spaces that you can switch between them effortlessly.</p>
<p>Don’t forget about some of the several lesser-known keyboard shortcuts that can noticeably speed up your day-to-day tasks. A great example is the Win + V command, which opens your clipboard history. Unlike the standard Ctrl + V function, which pastes only your most recent copied item, Win + V lets you select from multiple previously copied clips. This is incredibly handy when filling out forms, gathering research, or moving text around without constantly swapping between tabs or apps.</p>
<p>StackSocial’s heavily discounted offer won’t last forever. If you’ve been waiting for the right moment to upgrade your operating system, securing a Windows 11 Pro license for under $10 is an opportunity worth jumping on before it disappears. And remember to use the code <strong>KOTAKU10</strong> to save that extra $1, bringing it to $9.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Good morning, and welcome to your previously scheduled Monday. Don’t watch the clock, and this terrible day will end soon. Until then, enjoy this installment of Morning Checkpoint, <em>Kotaku</em>‘s daily round-up of video game news and other stuff you might care about. This time around, we get an update on <em>Fate of the Old Republic</em>, check in on <em>Fallout Shelter</em>, and perhaps sing that famous Grinch Christmas song.</p> <h2><strong>Casey Hudson denies claims that <em>FOTOR</em> is five years away</strong></h2> <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/star-wars-rpr-kotor-fate-of-the-republic-2000652729">During last week’s Game Awards, S<em>tar Wars: Fate of the Old Republic</em> was revealed</a>, and people got excited. A spiritual successor to<em> Knights of the Old Republic</em> led by that game’s director, Casey Hudson, who also helped create <em>Mass Effect</em>? Heck yeah. But, as pointed out by a few different reporters, this new<em> Star Wars</em> game is being developed by a studio that’s just a few months old and so, folks speculated, the game was likely a long way off, possibly not launching until 2030.&nbsp; This speculation quickly snowballed into full-on “rumors” and spread like wildfire, without proper context online, eventually leading to Hudson <a href="https://twitter.com/CaseyDHudson/status/1999652683972489385?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">publicly denying the 2030 date on social media</a>.</p>

 <p>“Don’t worry about the ‘not till 2030’ rumors,” <a href="https://x.com/CaseyDHudson/status/1999652683972489385?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">posted Hudson</a> on December 12. “Game will be out before then. I’m not getting any younger!”</p> <p>And while I’d love to be playing <em>FOTOR</em> sooner rather than later, I am curious as to why Hudson is so confident that something as large as a new <em>KOTOR</em>-like<em> Star Wars</em> RPG can be developed in under five years by a team that was just formed a few months ago. Maybe they have a super solid, streamlined plan with lots of support and resources to spare? Or maybe Hudson found a genie lamp? Regardless, according to Hudson, <em>FOTOR</em> will be out sometime before 2030. Place your bets now.</p>

 <h2><strong>10 years later, and <em>Fallout Shelter</em> just got its biggest update ever</strong></h2> <p>Mobile bunker-builder <em>Fallout Shelter</em> has been around since June 2015. And despite its age, <em>Shelter</em> is still extremely popular, receiving ports to console and PC and numerous updates. Its most recent one, out now, is its biggest yet, adding seasons, new characters, quests, and more connections to Amazon’s live-action <em>Fallout</em> show.</p>

 <p>“Rejoice, Overseers – <em>Fallout Shelter</em>’s biggest update yet is here,” <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/588430/Fallout_Shelter/">explained Bethesda on the game’s Steam page</a>. “Years of content previously only available on mobile is now available on Steam, including new questlines, characters, weapons, themes, and more.” It ain’t <em>Fallout 5,</em> but at least it’s something.</p>

 <h2><strong>Arcade1Up might have shut down over the weekend</strong></h2> <p>Over the weekend, as reported by <a href="https://www.timeextension.com/news/2025/12/reports-suggest-arcade1up-is-shutting-down"><em>Time Extension</em></a>, an <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Arcade1Up/comments/1pjy92j/megathread_arcade1up_is_shutting_down/">email was shared online</a> that seemed to indicate that Arcade1Up, a company that specializes in creating modern arcade cabinets, was shutting down. The reported internal email, which was sent on December 10, claims that Arcade1Up shut down on December 12 and that the future of the brand is unknown. At least one dev studio that had worked with the arcade makers has <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Arcade1Up/comments/17cia8r/comment/k5umj6g/">already indicated</a> that its classic ports will still support online play via a backdoor that players will be able to turn on in the future if the shutdown affects online servers. So far, Arcade1Up has yet to confirm or deny the reports of its demise.</p>

 <h2><strong><em>Katamari Damacy’s</em> creator might be done making games after T<em>o a T</em> sold poorly</strong></h2> <p>Keita Takahashi, the creator of <em>Katamari Damacy,</em> released a new and odd-looking game this year, <em><a href="https://kotaku.com/annapurna-interactive-indie-to-a-t-giraffe-song-sugar-1851766204">To a T</a>,&nbsp;</em>and if that’s the first you’re hearing about it, well, you aren’t alone. Apparently, the famed creator says the game didn’t sell well, and it has potentially forced him out of the game industry.</p>

 <p>“I recently returned to Japan, and one of the reasons I had to do so was because <em>T</em><em>o a T</em>&nbsp;didn’t sell well,” <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/adventure/i-wish-i-had-the-katamari-damacy-ip-to-a-t-was-meant-to-counter-the-downer-vibes-of-2019-america-but-keita-takahashi-says-it-didnt-sell-well-and-fears-it-just-wasnt-a-good-fit/">Takahashi recently told <em>GamesRadar</em>.</a> “My next goal is to support my children and find them a school in Japan. Then, if I feel that I don’t belong in the games industry, I’ll have to look elsewhere.”</p> <p>It’s a real shame that an offbeat game like <em>To a T,</em> struggled to find an audience in 2025, and when the developer was asked if there was still room for weird, experimental games in the industry, Takahashi said “I’m not sure” and admitted that it’s “definitely” become harder for him to make these kinds of games anymore.</p> <h2>ICYMI:</h2> <ul> <li><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-legends-za-mega-dimension-review-dlc-raichu-2000653106">Here’s our review of <em>Pokémon’s</em> new DLC</a></li> <li><a href="https://kotaku.com/everything-we-know-about-star-wars-fate-of-the-old-republic-release-date-trailer-2000653076">Learn more about<em> Fate of the Old Republic</em></a></li> <li><a href="https://kotaku.com/doom-id-software-union-microsoft-xbox-cwa-2000653008">The makers of <em>Doom</em> have formed a union</a></li> </ul> <h2>Watch This:</h2>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/lenovo-idea-tab-becomes-the-cheapest-android-tablet-with-a-holiday-discount-lowest-price-of-the-year-2000653357</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Tablets make it incredibly easy to stay both productive and entertained on the go. These are also great for students who don’t want to carry a huge laptop to college and are looking to take notes or work on assignments digitally. The Lenovo Idea Tab does an excellent job at that, and Amazon is letting you pick one up without spending a ton.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6048/">It typically goes for around $240, but thanks to a nice 25% discount, you can grab yourself one for just $180.</a> The tablet comes with a pen for easy navigation, plus a folio case, which makes it safe to carry around. The deal is open to all shoppers, but it’s likely to ship after Christmas. If that’s not an issue, we suggest jumping on the discount as soon as you can!</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6048/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Packs a Punch</h2>
<p>The tablet flaunts an 11-inch 2.5K IPS touchscreen display. It delivers sharp visuals while actively reducing blue light emission to keep the screen comfortable on the eyes; great for exam season, where you might need to pull all-nighters with it. The display is nicely paired with immersive sound, thanks to quad Dolby Atmos-tuned speakers. You will be able to take online lectures comfortably, while still enjoying your study breaks by squeezing in an episode of Stranger Things to take your mind off complicated maths problems.</p>
<p>Four learning apps – including Lenovo AI Note, Squid, Nebo, and MyScript Calculator – come built in. These let you write down important points during the lecture, organize tasks, sketch some diagrams, and perform basic mathematical calculations without needing to install another program. Performing quick Google searches has never been easier, either. A quick circle around items or text pulls up the answers you’re looking for, and it even translates content into your preferred language without switching to another app. The included Lenovo Tab Pen takes the experience even further. It makes it quite convenient to scroll, swipe, draw, and jot thoughts down.</p>



<p>Behind the scenes is a powerful MediaTek Dimensity 6300 processor working tirelessly to keep everything running smoothly. The 8GB memory lets you do a bunch (using multiple applications, switching tabs) without experiencing noticeable slowdowns, while the 256 GB built-in storage offers plenty of space to store all your important files and programs. You will be able to keep all your essential programs, group presentations, final year projects, and more in a single place without feeling limited.</p>
<p>As for the battery, you can expect around 12 hours of continuous use on a single charge. That’s enough to go at least two days without worrying about plugging it in. And finally, the included case lets you prop the thing up anywhere you want, with stability. You can use it in the classroom, cafeteria, on your way back home, and even on the couch easily.</p>
<p>All of these features come together to make the Lenovo Idea Tab one of the best tablets for students and work professionals on the market. It’s made to handle work and play efficiently, and the long battery life makes it quite easy to carry with you when you’re out and about. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6048/">Be sure to grab it before the deal expires if you want to avoid paying the full $240 for it. Once the discount is gone, we don’t expect it to be back before New Year’s.</a></p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/megabonk-update-patch-vampire-survivors-2000653410</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><em>Megabonk</em>, a 3D reimagining of <em>Vampire Survivors </em>that became one of 2025’s surprise hits, has somewhat belatedly released its Halloween update just in time for the winter holidays. But hey, Christmas has always been spook-adjacent, right? There’s <em>A Christmas Carol</em>,&nbsp;<em>Krampus</em>,&nbsp;<em>A Charlie Brown Christmas</em>…</p> <p>“yoo I’ve finally finished the update I was working on,” said solo developer Vedinad <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/3405340?updates=true&amp;emclan=103582791474891212&amp;emgid=523110495538905880">in a post on Steam</a>. “Was originally going to be a small halloween update, but I wanted to make it a bit bigger so it turned into a bit more work than I initially planned.” He goes on to list the new content added in the Spooky Update:</p>

 <ul> <li>New Map</li> <li>New Character</li> <li>New Weapon</li> <li><wbr>New Items</li> <li><wbr>New Enemies and Bosses</li> <li><wbr>New Achievements and challenges<wbr></li> </ul> <p><em>Megabonk</em>&nbsp;is an unabashed reinterpretation of Poncle’s <em>Vampire Survivors</em>, albeit with a few original twists of its own, not least that it’s now a 3D, third-person action game. It came out in September this year and absolutely exploded in popularity almost right away. And deservedly so! <a href="https://kotaku.com/megabonk-vampire-survivors-clone-steam-pc-2000627591">It’s a great game, even if most of its ideas aren’t entirely original</a>. It also came out a couple of months ahead of Poncle announcing its own reinterpretation of&nbsp;<a href="https://kotaku.com/the-vampire-survivorssequel-was-just-revealed-and-its-a-dungeon-crawler-2000645860"><em>Vampire Survivors</em> as a 3D version of itself</a>, although in that case it’s also being combined with a deckbuilding roguelite.</p>

 <p>Alongside the new elements listed above, the Spooky Update also comes with a bunch of bug fixes, some new “advanced” settings for very niche tweaks, and a host of balancing changes. There’s also access to the game’s console, with the intention of making the game more open to speedrunning. And even this update has since received an update, fixing a few issues the spookiness introduced.</p> <p>The game’s well worth checking out. A lot of people already have, to the degree that it was nominated in this year’s Best Debut Indie Game category at the Game Awards, before the pseudonymous developer <a href="https://kotaku.com/megabonk-dev-officially-withdraws-it-from-the-game-awards-2000645270">withdraw it from consideration on the basis that it’s not really his first game</a>. (Something <a href="https://kotaku.com/game-awards-2025-tga-winners-losers-who-won-game-of-the-year-clair-obscur-2000652261">the category’s eventual winners</a> did&nbsp;<em>not</em> choose to do.)</p>

              <p>With Forza Horizon 5 making its way to the PS5 earlier this year, now’s the perfect time to jump in and enjoy one of the standout racing games of this generation. To elevate the experience even further, you’ll want the right gear—something that makes it feel like you’re in the driver’s seat. The Logitech G Driving Force Shifter for PlayStation, Xbox, and PC is currently seeing a major price drop. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6395/">Normally $60 on Amazon, it’s now discounted by 17%, bringing the cost down to just $50 for a limited time.</a></p>
<p>As funny as it would be to use the Logitech G Driving Force Shifter alongside a standard controller, I’m afraid that’s not possible. This product is part of a larger kit. Logitech’s G Series racing setup is crafted for maximum realism with a driving wheel, pedals, and this optional shifter. Real race cars are manual, not automatic. So if you want to complete your driving simulation setup, you’ll need this last piece of the puzzle.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6395/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<p>The Logitech G Driving Force Shifter is compatible with Logitech G29 and G290 Driving Force Racing Wheels in order to enhance your experience behind the wheel. The shifter plugs in via cable to the rear side of your Logitech driving wheel.</p>
<p>You get real, quality construction that has the weight and feel of an actually shifter you might find in your own vehicle. It’s made with a solid steel gear shaft. The knob and boot are covered in a high-quality hand-stitched leather, which makes it look and feel like the real deal. It’s also durable and can put off wear and tear for a long time.</p>
<p>The shifter can be securely mounted to your driving rig. The lever is designed to be grabbed and pulled around, so the whole unit needs to be able to hold it’s ground while you race. That’s why it has built-in clamps and bolt points. The clamps just twist on either side to screw into a secure fit, then you push down the knobs to lock it into place. Easy peasy.</p>



<h2>Ultimate Precision</h2>
<p>Using the six-speed shifter is fluid. You’re met with a satisfying, tactile click as you shift between each gear. You’ll be able to execute smooth, accurate gear transitions whether you’re speeding up down a straight away or coming out of a turn. Pull down to put your rig in reverse.</p>
<p>Aside from just enhancing your experience playing a racing game, a driving sim like this makes for a not so bad method of learning to be behind the wheel. Particularly if you’ve only ever driven automatic, this can provide a safe way to learn how to drive stick. If you travel a lot, especially in Europe, you’ll find that renting an automatic is far more expensive than renting manual. Plus, you’ll have a lot more options of vehicle choice with manual. It’s a good skill set to have.</p>

              <p>Tech purchases tend to be expensive, but they don’t have to be – if you know where to look for the best deals. Our team scans the internet for the top discounts that are actually worth your money, and those for a reliable everyday laptop under $800; we’ve got great news.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6394/">The 17-inch HP laptop (32GB RAM, 1TB SSD) can be yours for just $760 at Amazon, after the retailer took an unbelievable 67% off its usual $2,200 price.</a> It’s a straightforward discount, so you don’t need to worry about entering any complicated coupon codes or following twisted checkout steps to score it. Just add the laptop to your cart, and the offer applies automatically. The bundle comes with a free accessory kit worth almost $400, too, which sweetens the deal even more.</p>

<h2>Solid Performance for Demanding Tasks</h2>
<p>Starting off with the freebies; you’re getting an external CD/DVD drive, a Redragon mouse, a clean cloth, and Windows 11 Pro pre-installed. All of this is useful, but we especially like how you’re getting an efficient OS installed and ready to go. Microsoft has packed the system with a bunch of productivity and security tools that are specifically made keeping remote workers and creatives in mind. Windows 11 typically comes with specific installation requirements, but having it pre-installed means you can skip that entire setup hassle and get started with using it right away.</p>
<p>As for the laptop itself, it’s got a nice, expansive 17.3-inch Full HD screen that delivers stunning clarity and vibrant colors consistently. The anti-glare panel reduces reflections for a more comfortable viewing experience in all lighting situations, whether you’re using the machine out there in the sun or in your room at night. There’s a built-in HD camera with a physical privacy shutter right at the top of the screen for better video calls, too.</p>



<p>Those who need to type long documents frequently will appreciate the ergonomic keyboard that features soft keys to reduce finger and wrist fatigue during long sessions. It’s even got a dedicated Microsoft Copilot key for instant AI-powered assistance 24/7. Battery life is another strong selling point, as it delivers up to 7 hours of usage on a single charge. That translates into going an entire workday without plugging it in. Even better, recharging doesn’t take forever either, as HP Fast Charge boosts your battery from 0% to 50% in just about 45 minutes.</p>
<p>Power-wise, the laptop runs on an Intel Core i3-N305 8-Core processor, which is capable of hitting speeds up to 3.8 GHz. There’s 32 RAM to keep things running smoothly, and it’s especially great for multitaskers who prefer juggling at least a few tasks at the same time. It keeps noticeable slowdowns at bay, even when things get intense. Storage is made easy with the 1TB SSD. It’s not only spacious, but also gets you fast boot/transfer times, helping you stay productive throughout the day.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6394/">There’s a lot more to appreciate about this HP laptop, especially at its current price of $760.</a> For well under $1,000, you’re getting a machine that’s ideal for work professionals, creatives, students, and even casual users. It’s a limited-time discount that somehow managed to crawl through Black Friday, but it won’t be around forever. It’s best to snap it up as quick as you can, as we’re expecting the offer to expire soon.</p>
