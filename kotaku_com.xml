            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>The community manager for the popular and controversial online SWAT simulator <em>Ready Or Not </em>was fired after posting in the game’s official Discord server that “nothing of value was lost” following the <a href="https://kotaku.com/charlie-kirk-shooter-steam-library-valve-discord-radicalization-2000626897">recent assassination of conservative commentator Charlie Kirk</a>.</p> <p>On or around September 17, <em>Ready Or Not’s</em> community manager, known online as Kaminsky, was asked to add “Charlie Kirk” and a few variations of the name to the server’s list of filtered words. Kaminsky confirmed they had done so, but then shared their own personal thoughts about Kirk, who was murdered at a speaking event on September 10 in Utah. The community manager posted:</p> <blockquote><p>“Funny you mention that because me and my roomate are literally just talking about him getting shot. All I have to say is: Nothing of value was lost.”</p></blockquote> <p>Screenshots and posts of this comment <a href="https://x.com/KayfabeMediaYT/status/1968548146398609603/photo/1">were quickly shared online</a> by fans of Kirk and right-wing content creators, with many demanding that Void Interactive fire the manager.&nbsp; And that’s exactly what Void did.</p>

 <p><a href="https://bsky.app/profile/airbagged.bsky.social/post/3lz7e5vzadc2w">On Friday</a>, a Void Interactive representative confirmed in<em> Ready Or Not</em>‘s official Discord server that the studio had “ended” its “relationship” with Kaminsky. It’s unclear if the community manager was a full-time employee or a volunteer.&nbsp; Before the news was official, fans had spotted that Kaminisky, often referred to as Kam online, <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/airbagged.bsky.social/post/3lz5esqafws2e">was no longer listed</a> as being a part of the server. One Discord user in the game’s server <a href="https://discord.com/channels/310075021882294272/452425840274309120/1418631175823687750">claimed</a> that a sticker emoji featuring Kaminsky had also been removed.</p> <p><em>Kotaku</em> reached out to Void Interactive for comment. Kaminsky could not immediately be contacted.</p>

 <p>“To Our <em>Ready or Not</em> Community, We are aware of comments made by our community manager about a recent tragic event,” posted Void Interactive rep Gerby on Discord.&nbsp; “These statements do not reflect our values or represent our company. We have ended our relationship with this individual and reminded our team of the responsibility we all share when communicating on public platforms. Our focus remains on fostering a respectful and professional community around <em>Ready or Not.</em>”</p> <p>This isn’t the first video game industry employee to lose their job after saying the wrong thing about Kirk’s recent murder. Last week, <a href="https://kotaku.com/ghost-yotei-charlie-kirk-joke-playstation-sony-2000625478">a developer working on<em> Ghost of Yotei</em> was fired by Sony</a> after making a joke about Kirk’s alleged assassin. <a href="https://kotaku.com/charlie-kirk-shooter-discord-politics-helldivers-memes-2000626029">The alleged killer’s connection to video games</a> has become a big part of the story around Kirk’s murder, with reports that some of the assassin’s bullets had messages etched into them <a href="https://kotaku.com/charlie-kirk-shooter-helldivers-bullet-engraving-2000625439">referencing <em>Helldivers 2</em>.</a> Meanwhile, <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2025/09/17/charlie-kirk-jimmy-kimmel-abc-disney.html">ABC late-night host Jimmy Kimmel is also facing pressure</a> to apologize after comments he made about Kirk got his show pulled “indefinitely” on Thursday.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/elden-ring-nightreign%E2%80%98s-new-hard-mode-is-kicking-players-asses-so-much-they-can-now-demote-themselves-to-a-lower-difficulty.1302813/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>It’s only been a week since <em>Elden Ring: Nightreign</em>‘s <a href="https://kotaku.com/elden-ring-nightreign-deep-night-hard-mode-time-changes-2000624664">new hard mode was added</a> to the multiplayer roguelike, and FromSoftware is already patching in some relief after even the most stalwart fans found themselves brutally beaten down. The mode has five depths, with the goal being to eventually complete enough successful runs to reach the deepest and most difficult one. Now, however, players will have the option to arbitrarily boot themselves back up to upper levels so they can stop dying and actually have fun again.</p> <p>Depth 1 is straightforward enough. While some <a href="https://kotaku.com/elden-ring-nightreign-patch-notes-libra-nerf-deep-night-2000624624">harder enemies and new item debuffs</a> force players to adapt to the game in new ways, most were able to make short work of it. Then came Depth 2. For my team it was like hitting a brick wall, but others successfully made it to Depth 3. Past that, the game basically becomes a no-hit run mode in disguise. Within a few days some fans were already begging for an option to play on the lower difficulties again just for fun. With a shockingly quick turnaround, FromSoftware has now obliged.</p> <p><a href="https://en.bandainamcoent.eu/elden-ring/news/elden-ring-nightreign-upcoming-deep-of-night-adjustments">An update that went live today adds</a> “a new feature to voluntarily decrease your Depth ranking by one level.” It also gives loss protection to players at lower Depths, so that your first loss on Depth 3, 4, or 5 won’t immediately lose you points and kick you back to the previous one. This protection even applies if you’re returning to Depth 3 or 4 for the dozenth time. This is mostly for players at the final Depths who lose more points from a loss than they earn for each win.</p>

   <p>“Lets go voluntary derank,” one player <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Nightreign/comments/1nl4hun/elden_ring_nightreign_upcoming_deep_of_night/">wrote</a> on the subreddit. “This is based,” wrote another. “But we really just need more bosses.”</p> <p>The new system allows more casual players the option to enjoy the mechanics in the new mode without having to run something they just keep dying in. At the same time, some players are wondering why FromSoftware doesn’t just nuke the whole ranking up system altogether and just let players choose which Depth they want to play on from the jump. Some fans were also hoping for <a href="https://kotaku.com/elden-ring-nightreign-deep-night-difficulty-mode-when-2000620989">a true “endless” mode,</a> which was rumored based on original datamines for the Deep of Night update but which appear to have been based on a mistranslation.</p> <p>Deep of Night is cool overall, but the progression system has been a bit of a bust. It’s also not a replacement for new bosses, maps, or random events during runs. The new difficulty mode will need more tweaks if it’s going to keep<em> Elden Ring: Nightreign</em> in the multiplayer rotation for a lot of current players, especially with so many other big games coming out this fall. But in the meantime, at least everyone can go back and farm the broken Deep Relics they need from easier Depths.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/borderlands-4-the-kotaku-review.1302810/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><span>It’s been six years since the last mainline </span><i><span>Borderlands </span></i><span>game. (No, </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/tiny-tinas-wonderlands-borderlands-spinoff-impressions-1848705496"><i><span>Tiny Tina’s Wonderlands</span></i></a> <span>doesn’t count.) A lot has changed in the last six years, both in the land of video games and in the real world. Players expect a lot more from co-op shooters. And the people in charge are power-hungry losers. </span><i><span>Borderlands 4 </span></i><span>tries to change with the times, with mixed results.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>While it’s a damn fine shooter, the best Gearbox has made, and one which lets the franchise now stand comfortably next to genre titans like </span><i><span>Destiny</span></i><span>, its attempts to address life living under a fascist regime don’t work out as well. But you’ll probably be too busy talking and joking with your friends to notice.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><i><span>Borderlands 4</span></i><span>, in a lot of ways, feels like a soft reboot of the series. The past games still happened and are referenced in big and small ways throughout the story, but the sequel is set on the new planet of Kairos and features new villains, allies, and things to kill. <a href="https://kotaku.com/borderlands-3-the-kotaku-review-1838290570">And unlike </a></span><a href="https://kotaku.com/borderlands-3-the-kotaku-review-1838290570"><i><span>Borderlands 3</span></i></a><span>’s story, which revolved around saving the universe and hopping across the galaxy, </span><i><span>Borderlands 4</span></i><span> is a smaller, more contained yarn mostly focused on what happens when powerful people take control and never let go.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <h2><b>A New World To Be Saved</b></h2> <p><span>While I won’t spoil any specific details in this review, I’ll let you know ahead of time that if you are coming to </span><i><span>Borderlands 4 </span></i><span>to enjoy a satisfying tale of people rising up under fascism to defeat evil, you’ll get that—right up until the end of the main campaign. Then it kind of falls apart.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>A twist in the game’s finale turns its main villain, the Timekeeper, into a far less compelling character. But before that, I really enjoyed the amount of time Gearbox devoted to showing how evil the Timekeeper and his cronies are, and how characters deal with the question of how much they’re willing to sacrifice for freedom. And what happens when some go too far, or not far enough? Don’t expect </span><i><span>Andor</span></i><span>-like depth and writing about genocidal leaders here. Still, I was pleasantly surprised by how often I cared about what was happening to both new and returning characters alike. Gearbox’s writers do a fantastic job of really making you hate the Timekeeper and his various underlings. Don’t get </span><i><span>too </span></i><span>attached to anyone in this story. That’s all I’m saying…&nbsp;</span></p>

  <p><span>Of course, if you play </span><i><span>Borderlands 4 </span></i><span>with a group of your rowdy, silly friends, a lot of its writing will get buried under your pals screaming about loot drops or laughing about inside jokes. If you care at all about the tale Gearbox is telling here, do a run through the story by yourself and take your time to interact with characters and listen to audio logs.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>Regardless of whether you play alone or with others, to defeat the Timekeeper and break his ironclad hold over Karios and its suffering populace, you’ll need to kill thousands of troopers, aliens, monsters, and robots using some of the billions of guns available to loot in</span><i><span> Borderlands 4.&nbsp;</span></i></p>

 <h2><b>Killin’ In The Name…Of Fun</b></h2> <p><span>What’s going to keep me coming back to </span><i><span>Borderlands 4</span></i><span> for (likely) years is the gunplay and movement. I’ve never outright hated the combat in past </span><i><span>Borderlands</span></i><span> games, but this is the first one where I think Gearbox has truly nailed it. And not just because they tossed in more guns than ever before.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><i><span>Borderlands 4</span></i><span> lets players double jump, glide, grapple, and wall climb around the open world of Kairos. This, combined with guns that, overall, feel more distinct and punchier, really helps elevate </span><i><span>Borderlands 4 </span></i><span>into the upper echelon of first-person shooters.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><span>Further elevating combat in </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/borderlands-4-finishes-decade-old-quest-pre-sequel-dunks-watson-explained-2000624918"><i><span>Borderlands 4 </span></i></a><span>are the shooter’s four distinct and new playable Vault Hunters. Each one shakes up how combat encounters play out thanks to their different powers and abilities. Playing alongside a powerful Rafa, a cybersoldier, will lead to combat encounters that feel very different than when you play alone or next to other hunters.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>Really, you get like</span><i><span> 12 characters,</span></i><span> because each hunter has three skill trees that each feature mini-skill trees inside. Perhaps you and a pal both play Vex, the new Siren character. Well, you’ll likely be very different versions of Vex by the time you both reach level 50, thanks to all the different skill and ability options available to each of you.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <figure id="attachment_2000627162" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000627162"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000627162">©Gearbox</figcaption></figure> <p><span>As I leveled up, found great guns I liked, and got more comfortable with the new movement options, I would often get into flow states where I’d lost track of time. I’d end up losing 10 minutes to a random encounter on my way to a big quest simply because I just love shooting shit in this game so much.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>I did find, though, that </span><i><span>Borderlands 4 </span></i><span>has a nasty habit of throwing a few too many waves of enemies at you during a lot of encounters. I’d wipe out the fourth or fifth wave of angry psychos or space buffalo, and then another wave would arrive. And then another. It often felt like too much, and made some missions and activities drag on. Still, I wasn’t too mad because once I’d wiped every enemy out, I was left with piles of loot.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <h2><b>Crappy Green Pistols For As Far As The Eye Can See</b></h2> <p><span>The loot in </span><i><span>Borderlands 4,</span></i><span> like in past games, is the real secret sauce. It’s what keeps you going through a boring mission, or makes it hard to stop playing despite feeling tired and needing to go to bed. That promise that the next gun, shield, or grenade that drops will be better than anything you have.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>Sure, most of the time, what drops is garbage you won’t use, but thanks to</span><i><span> Bord</span></i><i><span>e</span></i><i><span>rlands 4</span></i><span>’s <a href="https://kotaku.com/the-11-best-changes-borderlands-4-junk-loot-menus-legendary-guns-2000624953">improved loot management options</a>, collecting and selling truckloads of terrible rifles and shotguns is easier than ever. And when that amazing piece of loot </span><i><span>does </span></i><span>pop out of a dead enemy or chest with a distinct ping noise, it’s one of the best feelings ever. If I could bottle it and sell it, I’d be a very rich man. It feels even better in </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/borderlands-4-includes-direct-jab-joke-gearbox-former-owner-embracer-bluff-2000624815"><i><span>Borderlands 4 </span></i></a><span>because some of the best loot, Legendary guns, are much rarer than in the last game.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><span>And because nearly everything you do around the open world of Karios rewards you with loot, it can be hard not to just keep playing for hours and hours. Kairos is a big map, chockablock with small activities to complete–like activating a radio tower and defending it from baddies–as well as bigger or sillier side quests, world bosses, collectibles to hunt down, secrets to find, and random events to complete.&nbsp;</span></p> <div>           <ul>                           <li>                 <p>Back-of-the-box-quote</p>                 <p>"Billions of guns, four friends, one meh ending."</p>               </li>                                         <li>                 <p>Developer:</p>                 <p>Gearbox</p>               </li>                                         <li>                 <p>Platforms:</p>                 <p>Xbox Series X/S, PS5, PC (Played on both PS5 and PC) </p>               </li>                                         <li>                 <p>Type of game:</p>                 <p>First-person co-op focused sci-fi looter shooter</p>               </li>                               </ul><ul>                                         <li>                 <p>Liked:</p>                 <p>Combat better than ever, great traversal options, QoL changes, open world.  </p>               </li>                                         <li>                 <p>Disliked:</p>                 <p>Bugs and performance problems, less-than-satisfying ending, some fights feel too big.</p>               </li>                                         <li>                 <p>Release date:</p>                 <p>September 12, 2025 </p>               </li>                                     </ul>         </div>  <p><span>As a result, the open world of </span><i><span>Borderlands 4</span></i><span> is more active and alive than in any previous entry in the franchise, and all of this content rewards you with more loot. Thank god you can junk most of it in seconds. Otherwise, I’d have drowned in all the green pistols that the game dumped on me over my 60 or so hours with it across PS5 and PC.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><span>Loot also becomes a currency among friends. Get a cool sniper, but you don’t snipe? Drop it for your friend. And then, if they find a badass shield that suits your character build better, they’ll share it with you, or you can at least guilt-trip them into giving it over. And because guns can spawn with all sorts of wild extra parts that turn SMGs into rocket snipers or whatever, hunting for loot and sharing it with pals is more exciting than ever.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>Well, assuming you can </span><i><span>see </span></i><span>the guns you have. A nasty bug affected one of my friends and made all his guns invisible. Which leads me to my biggest disappointment with</span><i><span> Borderlands 4: </span></i><span>the technical problems.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <h2><b>Excuse Me, There’s Some Bugs In My Looter Shooter</b></h2> <p><span>On PlayStation 5 Pro, I routinely had to restart the game due to the performance tanking <a href="https://kotaku.com/borderlands-4-performance-fps-drops-stutter-ps5-pro-xbox-console-restart-gearbox-2000626487">after a few hours of play</a>. I also encountered a few bugged quests that required restarts, too. Over on PC, <a href="https://kotaku.com/borderlands-4-pc-performance-dlss-frame-gen-pitchford-gearbox-steam-2000625765">many players and I have experienced optimization and performance problems</a>. Even on my RTX 5080, which can run everything I throw at it, </span><i><span>Borderlands 4 </span></i><span>demands I turn on DLSS and frame gen while also turning down visual settings. And despite getting the game to run at a mostly stable 120FPS, I still encounter microstutters.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>On both platforms, I’ve also found empty vending machines, seen characters hovering off the ground, had animations break, events not start, and encountered audio lines cutting out randomly.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><span>None of this has completely ruined my enjoyment of </span><i><span><a href="https://kotaku.com/borderlands-4-pc-performance-patch-console-crash-pitchford-2000626826">Borderlands</a> 4</span></i><span>, and I’ve had some sessions in which it all worked pretty flawlessly, minus some hitches or stutters. But it would be irresponsible not to mention these technical flaws and annoyances in a review o</span><i><span>f Borderlands 4,</span></i><span> as they are just as much a part of the game as the loot, combat, and story. Hopefully, Gearbox can patch the game over the next few weeks and months to create a better experience, and this part of my review will then become a weird artifact from the past.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <figure id="attachment_2000627163" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000627163"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000627163">©Gearbox</figcaption></figure> <p><span>Still, despite some annoying bugs and performance problems, </span><i><span>Borderlands 4,</span></i><span> in many ways, is the best game Gearbox has ever made.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>It takes what the studio has learned about creating looter shooters and builds upon that in a way that feels like a big moment for the franchise. A large leap forward in both gameplay and narrative. I joked with colleagues that critics and players would suggest this is where the series “finally grew up,” but really, that’s what it feels like.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><span>The story isn’t as cringeworthy, with far fewer memes, more character-driven jokes, and a sense that you might not get out of this adventure with all your friends in one piece. The combat and movement are more refined and expanded, no longer feeling like an afterthought as was the case in past games. And the world of Kairos is visually varied and packed with good reasons to explore it alone or with friends.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>Bugs, performance problems, a less-than-memorable villain, and a grindy endgame are disappointing for sure, but what Gearbox has put together is still a mostly fun, action-packed, and hand-crafted looter shooter that proves once again that this studio is still the best at making these kinds of over-the-top FPS RPGs. </span></p>

              <p><span>There’s a lot to love about </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/sonic-racing-crossworlds-crossover-review-hatsune-miku-2000626583"><i><span>Sonic Racing: Crossworlds</span></i></a><span>. The kart racer is just under a week away from launch, and I’ve been playing it and really enjoying Sonic and friends’ latest run around the racetrack. It’s got a surprising amount of depth with its customizable builds, a wide spread of tracks referencing </span><i><span>Sonic </span></i><span>history, and its races are chaotic, fast-paced fun. But one of the best things the game does happens just before the races. In single-player modes, you’re pitted against a specific Rival racer, and before the first race, they’ll exchange some words with whoever you’re playing as. These brief back-and-forths are absolutely delightful, and show that everyone in the </span><i><span>Sonic </span></i><span>cast is a professional trash talker.</span></p> <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="zxx" dir="ltr"><a href="https://t.co/CNSbEod2FF">pic.twitter.com/CNSbEod2FF</a></p> <p>— Mlick (@Mlickles) <a href="https://twitter.com/Mlickles/status/1968720889840562281?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">September 18, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <p><span>When I play </span><i><span>Crossworlds</span></i><span>, I play almost exclusively as Shadow the Hedgehog, so I’ve seen just how vicious Sonic Team has made my boy when talking to pretty much everyone on the roster.

              <p>We’ve all been there: that moment when your iPhone runs out of battery when you desperately need it to last. Even if you do have a power bank, more often than not, it’s the wrong cable, or worse, the standby battery isn’t even charged. That’s the frustration this 50,000mAh power bank seeks to eliminate entirely: It’s enormous in size, has all the cables you could possibly need integrated right in, and is <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4197/">currently priced at an all-time low of $34 on Amazon, down dramatically from its usual $199</a>. That’s an <strong>83 percent off sale on a charger</strong>.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4197/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>An Actual Power Bank That Fixes Everyday Charging</h2>
<p>Let’s start with the number that means the most: <strong>50,000mAh</strong>. That is just a phenomenal amount of mobile power. In all realism, you could <strong>charge your iPhone more than a dozen times before this battery depletes itself</strong>. That’s seven days of continuous use without having to use a wall charger, or more than enough power to charge your phone, your earbuds, your tablet, and even a friend’s phone when you and your group are all running low on power. The appeal is that you don’t need to bring a lot of extra accessories with you. Instead <strong>of working with adapters and wires, all you need is built-in</strong>. The unit contains four cables built in (USB-C, Lightning, Micro-USB, and USB-A) so you just grab one out and plug in straight into your device.</p>



<p>And on top of that, this charger isn’t just small, but fast: With <strong>22.5W fast charging backed by PD 3.0 and QC 3.0/4.0 technology,</strong> it recognizes your device instantly and adjusts for optimal charging. For example, an iPhone 17 can go from zero to about 60 percent in half an hour. That’s faster than the old wall chargers Apple used to pack, and it’s incredibly useful when you’ve only got a few minutes before heading out the door.</p>
<p>Safety has been integrated into the system as well: The company also had a monitoring chip that keeps an eye on<strong> charging by milliseconds to avoid risks like overvoltage, overcurrent, or short circuits</strong>. Protection steps in if something goes amiss. That is, all your gadgets (whether the new iPhone 17, an iPad Pro, a Galaxy S25, or a Pixel phone) are charging without harm effectively.</p>
<p>If battery drain ever stranded or stressed you, grabbing this 50,000mAh power bank at its all-time lowest price is one of those genius purchases you won’t regret.</p>

              <p>Yesterday, a total overhaul remastering of the original <em>Puzzle Quest</em> was released, updating the 18-year-old match-3 RPG for modern machines, incorporating all its DLCs, adding new classes and missions, and offering a new generation a chance to figure out why people got so excited about it two decades ago. Since its original release, developer Infinity Plus 2 has created multiple spin-offs and sequels, mobile juggernaut <em>Gems of War</em>, and the somewhat less well-loved freemium&nbsp;<em>Puzzle Quest 3</em>, but it’s important to know that&nbsp;<em>Puzzle Quest</em>‘s origins go back much farther, all the way to the late 1980s, and a floppy disc that was thrown into a publisher’s trashcan. I spoke to&nbsp;<em>Puzzle Quest</em> lead developer Steve Fawkner to learn all about it.</p>  <p>When&nbsp;<em>Puzzle Quest: Challenge of the Warlords</em> came out in 2007, gaming was a&nbsp;very different place. This was before your entire PC gaming catalog was on Steam—heck, this was before <em>BioShock</em> was on Steam even, the first AAA game to pioneer such a digital release—and the existence of a digital download-only game was novel. It was a space well-occupied by the likes of PopCap, with smash hits such as&nbsp;<em>Bejeweled</em>,&nbsp;<em>Bookworm</em>, and&nbsp;<em>Peggle</em>, but it had yet to become The Next Big Thing. It was into this space that&nbsp;<em>Puzzle Quest</em> launched, a game explicitly inspired by&nbsp;<em>Bejeweled</em>, but developing the match-3 concept into a full-fledged RPG. And it was <em>huge</em>. But what tends to go forgotten, and mostly went unrealized even at the time, was that the “<em>Warlords</em>” in the game’s tagline isn’t just a bit of flavor—it’s a direct reference to Steve Fawkner’s previous gaming success story, the turn-based strategy RPG <em>Warlords</em> which launched in 1990.</p> <h2>In the trash, looking at the stars</h2> <p>“It was my eighth game at the time,” Australian developer Steve Fawkner told me over a video call. “I think my first game was ’83, about the tender age of 15. And it sold 32 copies.”</p>

 <p>That game was called&nbsp;<em>Quest for the Holy Grail</em>, released on the Spectrum 48K, the cassette given out with a note (including his home address) asking anyone who enjoyed it to mail him five dollars. 32 people sent him cash, and the bug bit him hard. He continued making games that he distributed at shows or sent to his growing mailing list, until in 1989 Fawkner created <em>Warlords </em>for the Amiga, a game that combined role-playing with turn-based strategy, and decided that, with this, he had made something of more significance. However, publishers didn’t appear to agree, and Fawkner was turned down over and over, including by his last resort, Strategic Studies Group (SSG). The president at SSG was so unimpressed he tossed the disc in the trash.</p> <p>It was only after the publishing boss saw his son playing it on his Amiga that he took more notice, and even then it was to say it “looks rubbish.” His son had fished the floppy out of the trash and installed it, and really enjoyed it. He convinced his father it was worth a look, the game got signed, and now, three sequels, a physical card game, and the spin-off <em>Warlords: Battlecry</em> series later, it’s fair to say the kid was vindicated.</p>

 <p>I was pretty shocked when Fawkner then added, “You know, at this stage, I’m pretty much done with the strategy genre. I really haven’t played the strategy genre since.” Surely you’ve played&nbsp;<em>Total War,</em> I splutter, finding it impossible that someone so significant in an entire field of games would be able to just walk away. “I snack on them,” he concedes. He’ll buy everything, play a single game of it, “literally one game, and go, ‘That’s great! I really enjoyed that! But I’m just gonna move on now.'”</p> <p>Instead, it’s puzzle games that have continued to beguile the developer (alongside “a lot of <em>Diablo”</em>) since the creation of <em>Puzzle Quest</em>. It was while playing <em>Bejeweled</em> late into the night when he was supposed to be working on&nbsp;<em>Warlords: Battlecry 4</em> that Fawkner realized there was something special here, something he wanted to work on. Originally called&nbsp;<em>Warlords: Champions</em>, his combination of match-3 and a more traditional fantasy role-playing game was in development as early as 2004. A mock-up of the systems was put together in days, then the story (set in the world of <em>Warlords</em>) was written, and the full game came together in just months. Three years later, he still hadn’t found a publisher.</p>

 <p>“I basically sold everything I could sell just to keep that development running for three years,” said Fawkner, so convinced was he that this game was something special. Eventually, Japanese publisher D3 took an interest, signed it up, and arranged for a DS port to be released alongside the PC version, with the finally released game being vastly more complex than the version quickly put together in 2004. “You give an old-school developer three years,” Fawkner laughs, “and that’s kind of what we pump out.” The lack of early interest among publishers in the end proved a massive benefit. “It actually worked in our favor, because we got to put so much into the game.”</p> <figure id="attachment_2000626913" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000626913"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000626913">© 505 Games / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <h2>Anti-Cheat Technology</h2> <p><em>Puzzle Quest</em> uses its <em>Bejeweled</em>-style grid of gems as a means of violence. Each color of gem represents a form of mana, and eliminating them from the grid adds to your character’s mana pools, eventually allowing an ever-growing collection of spells to be triggered. Some affect the contents of the grid, others directly attack your opponent, and many more do a combination of the two. The grids also contain skulls that also launch attacks when matched, as well as gold for spending in shops, and XP for leveling up your character. It’s the complete RPG package, but played out via the puzzle format PopCap made so famous. Which is to say, it takes one of the most engaging puzzle game formats and makes it the core of an enormous fantasy story complete with quests, companions, and a big ol’ map to explore.</p>

 <p>Key to this success, and something that so many other games that have tried to mimic the success with other puzzling formats have missed, is that in&nbsp;<em>Puzzle Quest</em>, the enemy plays too. Instead of just hitting you with its own abilities, the CPU has to match gems as well, fill its own mana pools, and think about not leaving the grid in a shape that’s advantageous to you at the end of its turn. Which led to something most people remember about the game at the time: it always felt like it was cheating. It was not. In fact, it turns out it was doing the opposite.</p> <p>“So here’s the thing,” says Fawkner. “We did some focus testing and people were saying it felt like it was cheating, and I’m like, we want to fix that.” Wanting to know what it was that felt like cheating, Fawkner’s team tracked some stats in the game, and it turned out it was all about what they call “lucky events.” When the grid would drop in skulls to attack, or set up a four-of-a-kind match, if it happened for the player it felt natural, but if it happened for the AI it felt like cheating. From their experiments, it turns out that players need to be lucky <em>two to three times</em> more often than the CPU before a game feels fair. So, after launch, the game was patched to lower the possible luck for the AI! If the grid was due to randomly drop in three gems of the same color or a row of skulls for the AI opponent, it would occasionally switch them out for a less useful combination, but never do this for the player. So for as much as people claimed the game was rigged against them, the complete opposite was true. This in fact went further, with the AI already programmed to make mistakes and sometimes miss opportunistic turns, because as Fawkner’s team had learned from creating the famously good <em>Warlords</em> AI, the more mistakes it made, the more human it felt.</p>

 <figure id="attachment_2000626914" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000626914"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000626914">© 505 Games / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <h2>From premium to freemium</h2> <p>20 years later, <em>Puzzle Quest</em> is still a big deal for Infinity Plus 2. People still buy the original (the excellent sequel, <em>Puzzle Quest II</em>, is no longer on sale), there are the licensed rights for games like <em>Marvel Puzzle Quest&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Magic: The Gathering – Puzzle Quest</em>, and even the lackluster <em>Puzzle Quest 3</em> chugs along well enough. Plus of course, there’s <em>Gems of War</em>.</p> <p><em>Gems of War</em> is a reinvention of <em>Puzzle Quest</em> as a free-to-play mobile game, complete with its own vast fantasy world, in which teams of four characters work together to use the grid to fire off their own abilities at AI enemies. But it’s also somewhat online, letting you sort of battle human opponents by competing against their bespoke teams controlled by the game’s AI, as well as join guilds, working toward goals, and always, always be grinding to unlock the next level or new character card. As such, with numerous in-game currencies and at least three different ongoing battle passes, <em>Gems of War</em> is a game that’s absolutely set up to milk its players for every penny. And yet, when I played it for a couple of months a few years back, I never felt inclined to buy a thing. I remember chatting with the much-missed and wonderful <em>Kotaku</em> writer Mike Fahey about this, and Fahey’s conspiratorial theory was that Infinity Plus 2 had deliberately designed the game to let people evade payments out of some objection to the whole freemium model. So I figured, heck, as a tribute to Mike, why not put this to Fawkner, no matter how awkward it might be.</p>

 <p>“He’s not entirely wrong,” Fawkner replies.</p> <p>“We wanted to make it as free as we possibly could,” the veteran developer explained. “There were certain foundations to that game. I went in saying, to do it right, I want to make sure there’s nothing in this game you can’t get if you work for it. And I want to make sure that when people are spending, they kind of feel good about the spend, like they really get something for it.” Wanting to avoid the worst of gacha games (although I should add, there <em>are</em> gacha elements where you certainly can spend money for a random chance pull), Fawkner says he believes their approach to the model is a big part of the game’s success. 11 years in, the game is still running and adding twice-weekly updates, so it’s clearly working out. “We’re doing really well,” Fawkner adds, “but it’s not and never will be a billion-dollar-a-year kind of game. I think we’re OK with that. Is there a level of frustration from our publishing partners that we weren’t greedy? Probably!”</p> <figure id="attachment_2000626916" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000626916"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000626916">© 505 Games / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p>With a son who has spent months playing&nbsp;<em>Gems of War</em> to a ludicrously high level, I’m not sure just how innocent the game is when it comes to in-game spending, given there are a lot of nags and pop-ups, and I’ve had to say no to a lot of requests to buy stuff! (And in the interests of full disclosure, after Fawkner and I chatted and he learned that my 10-year-old was over level 600, his development team demanded he send the boy an in-game “care package,” or a bunch of free shit. He’s the corrupted one, not me.)</p>

 <p>That does bring us on to&nbsp;<em>Puzzle Quest 3</em>, another freemium game that many argue does not get the balance right. Its reviews on Steam have only just managed to scrape their way up to “Mixed” after two years of updates and changes, partly due to quite significant mechanical changes to how the game plays (you play three moves in a row, and can now move gems diagonally), and partly because of its brutal in-app purchases, which don’t sit well with players. “What we produced was not a game I’m ashamed of,” says Fawkner. “I’m very proud of it and shipped a game on time that was very playable and very pretty.” However, it was also created during the covid lockdowns, which were something that hit Australia especially hard. Months would go by during which you weren’t allowed to leave your house, and the team was scattered and scared. Fawkner told me that the office was only around the corner from his home, but getting there was sometimes impossible, with police on the streets requiring paperwork if you were caught outdoors.</p> <p>“I don’t like to blame covid,” Fawkner adds, but says it was undeniably a factor. After release, and the very negative reception, the team “struggled” for a bit. “Could we make it into the game we originally envisaged?” He mentions how the reviews have improved since then, but it remains the case that there are still fewer than 1,000 of them, and the game never peaked beyond 221 concurrent players. “People let us know how they felt,” Fawkner says, “and the message was received loud and clear.”</p>

It’s faithful to the original in almost all ways, save for a big change in how the game handles a grid with no turns. What was once a “Mana Drain,” in which both sides lost all their mana for no fault of their own. “It always felt bad, right?” asks Fawkner. “It’s like, ‘I’m being punished.’ So I said, what if we make it a storm? What if, when the board locks up, it just all explodes and the mana splits between you and the enemy? Now you’ve got an abundance of mana.”</p> <p>I can report it works. The game looks great, even at ridiculous aspect ratios, and the replacement of Mana Drain is very welcome. Straight away I’ve found myself hooked on “just one more battle,” buoyed by the constant sense of both character and narrative progress, unlocking new quests and leveling up to use new spells…It’s all still there, just like in 2007, except now it’s much prettier. I cannot wait to see if it gets a release for my Android tablet, after which you may well not hear from me for a while. As it is, it’s running on my PC behind this window I’m typing into, tempting me back.</p>

 <p>Infinity Plus 2 has hopes that if&nbsp;<em>Puzzle Quest: Immortal Edition</em> succeeds, they will be able to do the same for&nbsp;<em>Puzzle Quest 2</em>, and then: “What I’d really absolutely&nbsp;<em>adore</em> to do is take&nbsp;<em>Puzzle Quest 3&nbsp;</em>and turn that into a premium version, move it back a little bit toward&nbsp;<em>Puzzle Quest 1</em> mechanics. I think that would be a really interesting project.”</p> <p>As for a possible <em>Warlords V</em>? Is Fawkner really so set to never return to the strategy? “I want to play it a little bit,” he says. “But I want to make it a lot.” Gosh. “I would love to have a team that’s making it here, me overseeing the making of it, adding some flavor. I think that would be an ideal outcome. So that could happen, you know? It’s a good old nostalgic franchise. What it probably needs is a couple of turn-based strategy games to go well, then it’s an easy pitch to the business department to say, ‘Hey, you know, we’ve got this strategy game sitting here. Lots of expertise, lots of nostalgia. You can do this.’ Lightning’s gotta strike the right place.”</p>
