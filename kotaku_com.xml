And speaking of expansions, <em>The Storybook Vale</em> hasn’t shied away from adding a wide variety of new meals and new ingredients to make them. One of these ingredients—Salt Crystals— can seem a bit elusive at first, but it’s really not that hard to find.</p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="197298" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="Live Forever in the Universe of 'New World: Aeternum'" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="108" data-playlist="197298,197284,197260" data-current="197298"><div><p>Live Forever in the Universe of 'New World: Aeternum'</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197298/197298_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197298/197298_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197298/197298_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197298/197298_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"></video></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>That being said, obtaining a full stack of Salt Crystals can be a bit time-consuming, so we’ll tell you where to find this ingredient in <em>The Storybook Vale</em> and how to stock up on it faster.</p><h2 id="h3689"><a id="location"></a>Where To Find Salt Crystals In <em>The Storybook Vale</em></h2><p>If you’ve glanced at Salt Crystals in your collection menu, you’ve no doubt seen that it lists all four sections from the Everafter as locations to obtain the ingredient. However, clearing the way to all of these areas doesn’t reveal anything to harvest or purchase to grant you Salt Crystals. That’s because this ingredient is, strangely, only obtained via fishing.</p><p><strong>Salt Crystals are caught by fishing in the Everafter biome</strong>. But before you go casting your lure into the colorful pools scattered through this darkly magical section of <em>The Storybook Vale</em>, it’s important to remember that <strong>Salt Crystals can only be obtained by fishing outside of pools</strong>.</p><figure id="" data-id="457b0ed192e306e9c996812439678ab5" data-recommend-id="image://457b0ed192e306e9c996812439678ab5" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A large Salt Crystal hovers on the screen." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A large Salt Crystal hovers on the screen." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Disney / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="457b0ed192e306e9c996812439678ab5" data-recommend-id="image://457b0ed192e306e9c996812439678ab5" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A large Salt Crystal hovers on the screen." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Unfortunately, this ingredient shares a spawn with fish, so not every cast will earn you a Salt Crystal. But make sure that you bring along a fishing friend so that you’ll earn a second Salt Crystal each time you fish one up. Keep at it long enough and you’ll have yourself a full stack of this spice.</p><h2 id="h3690"><a id="cook"></a>What Can You Cook With Salt Crystals?<br></h2><p>These meals all require Salt Crystals to cook to perfection: <br></p><ul data-type="List" data-style="Bullet"><li>A Very Unusual Tea-Time - Salt Crystal, Yogurt, Spiral Strawberry, Sour Berries</li><li>Aquatic Escargot - Salt Crystal, Trumpet Snail, Garlic</li><li>Arcane Garlic Whelk - Salt Crystal, Sorcerer Hat Hermit Crab, Garlic, Any Spice</li><li>Caprese Salad - Salt Crystal, Any Vegetable, Olives, Flyleaf Feta, Any Spice</li><li>Grecian Fish Bake - Salt Crystal, Stygian Mudskipper, Elysian Grain, Olives, Ambrosia</li><li>Greek Potatoes - Salt Crystal, Potato, Garlic, Any Fruit, Any Spice</li><li>Salt-Baked Sea Wolf - Salt Crystal, Sea Wolf</li><li>Salt-Pickled Cauliflower - Salt Crystal, Cauliflower, Any Spice</li><li>Salt-Pickled Garlic - Salt Crystal, Garlic, Any Spice</li><li>Salt-Pickled Green Bean - Salt Crystal, Green Beans, Any Spice</li><li>Salt-Pickled Radicchio - Salt Crystal, Radicchio, Any Spice</li><li>Salt-Pickled Radish - Salt Crystal, Radish, Any Spice</li><li>Salt-Pickled Sea Grapes - Salt Crystal, Sea Grapes, Any Spice</li><li>Shovelbird Eggs Benedict - Salt Crystal, Elysian Grain, Shovelbird Egg, Spiral, Strawberry</li><li>Soda Bread &amp; Feta - Salt Crystal, Wheat, Flyleaf Feta</li></ul><p>Granted, with <em>The Storybook Vale</em>’s second half coming at a later date, there is almost certain to be additional meals added that make use of Salt Crystals in the future.

That includes a new promotion with Build-A-Bear that lets you make cuddly, suited-up versions of Sonic, Shadow, and Tails. I can’t lie, I’m somewhat drawn to the idea of making Shadow and dressing him up in cool clothes. I’m not sure if the fashion for these little guys has gotten better since I last entered a Build-A-Bear maybe seven years ago, but Shadow is one of the few characters who might get me to try it out. [<em>What’s wrong with Gengar, you monster—Ed</em>]</p><p>The most interesting thing about the promotion, however, is that Build-A-Bear might have dropped a hint about <em>Sonic the Hedgehog 3</em>’s story by giving Shadow a specific accessory. The antihero comes bundled with a Master Emerald to carry, and that has some big implications about the direction <em>Sonic 3 </em>might go. Assuming this is a reference to the film itself and not <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/sonic-x-shadow-generations-review-levels-powers-1851676560&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/sonic-x-shadow-generations-review-levels-powers-1851676560">Shadow’s game appearances</a></span>, this implies Shadow may seek out the Master Emerald, which was last seen in the care of Sonic and his friends at the end of <em>Sonic 2</em>.</p><p>Up to this point, Shadow’s appearances in the movie’s trailers haven’t made the connection between him and the emerald, which houses the Chaos Emeralds in the movie’s continuity. These are used to transform Sonic and Shadow into their super forms, which give them the ability to fly, make them more powerful, and turn their quills into a golden yellow or white. There’s a brief clip <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/sonic-3-trailer-shadow-gun-rouge-eggman-gerald-moon-1851707554&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/sonic-3-trailer-shadow-gun-rouge-eggman-gerald-moon-1851707554">in the film’s second trailer</a></span> that some fans think might imply the two hedgehogs will fight in their super forms, and a similarly-brief shot of the rivals reaching for the emeralds without any explanation <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sy4sjrgjjuY&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sy4sjrgjjuY" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">in recent TV spots</a></span>, but the trailers haven’t fixated on this plot point at all.</p><p>Meanwhile, Sonic has a golden ring accessory, and his red shoes come as a separate set. Kinda seems like a baldfaced attempt at getting money out of people for a complete character, especially considering Shadow and Tails have their shoes already. Weird choice, but a transparent one.

Concluding with <em>Bloodborne</em> and its fans’ relentless calls for more <em>Bloodborne</em> was certainly a choice. </p><p>Some have called using a 30th-anniversary celebration to target <em>Bloodborne</em> sickos “<span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://x.com/shinobi602/status/1863626399568785857&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://x.com/shinobi602/status/1863626399568785857" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pure evil</a></span>.” “Someone at PlayStation woke up and chose violence today,” <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://x.com/Hazz3r/status/1863602943246647347&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://x.com/Hazz3r/status/1863602943246647347" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">wrote</a></span> another.

Probably nothing, right? Right?</p><p>It’s never been exactly clear what the hold-up is, given the <em>Dark Souls </em>spiritual spin-off’s critical acclaim and sales success (7.5 million copies sold by last count). FromSoftware made it, but Sony owns the rights. Maybe neither party can agree on what it would take to bring the game into the future nearly a decade later. Bluepoint Games, which made the <em>Shadow of the Colossus</em> and <em>Demon’s Soul</em> remakes, felt like an obvious candidate to work on an update but is reportedly in pre-production for its own original IP. </p><p>Whatever the case may be, <em>Bloodborne</em> fans will never give up.

Yes to all of the above, but it’s not what’s fueling my newfound hype; it’s the anime OP-ass launch trailer NetEase put out over the weekend.</p><p>The trailer doubles as both a launch trailer and a reveal of the <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/marvel-rivals-heroes-character-x-men-avengers-fantastic-1851614564&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/marvel-rivals-heroes-character-x-men-avengers-fantastic-1851614564">final five heroes</a></span> joining <em>Marvel Rivals</em>’ launch roster. Iron Fist, Black Widow, Cloak and Dagger (think Ice Climbers from <em>Smash Bros. </em>with two characters being one playable entity), Squirrel Girl, and Wolverine will all join the line-up of 33 heroes pushing legally distinct payloads. That’s all well and good, and I’ll probably give comic-accurate short king Wolverine a try, but what I’m most excited by today is how NetEase and vocalist Chrissy Costanza created the kind of hero showcase music video you only see in front of an anime that makes you believe in the power of friendship. Costanza’s vocals on “Rivals ‘Til the End” soar over action-packed scenes of Marvel’s greatest heroes doing hero shit. All the cool team-ups—like Hulk throwing Wolverine and Magik teleporting Psylocke up the side of an exploding skyscraper—are sick, but every cool moment is elevated by how good the song is. It’s peak anime opening, and I hope it plays when you boot up the game, because you will not catch me skipping it.</p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="196049" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="This Modern Warfare 3 Gameplay Feature Spices Up A Weak Campaign" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="134" data-playlist="196049,196653,196880" data-current="196049"><div><p>This Modern Warfare 3 Gameplay Feature Spices Up A Weak Campaign</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196049/196049_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196049/196049_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196049/196049_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196049/196049_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/21580.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>Luckily, all this excitement isn’t unfounded.

This update added five new themes for the <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/the-best-games-for-the-playstation-5-1845726626&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/the-best-games-for-the-playstation-5-1845726626">PlayStation 5</a></span> dashboard, four of which are based on past consoles and one based on the PlayStation brand itself. </p><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://x.com/tomwarren/status/1863620268687573453&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://x.com/tomwarren/status/1863620268687573453" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The themes are really cool</a></span>. I picked the PS2 theme, and not only did it add all the abstract blue and green objects from the PS2 boot menu to my PS5's dashboard, it also changed all the colors in all the menus and added PS2 menu noises to everything. I didn’t realize until swapping between the different themes how burnt into my brain some of these old PlayStation noises are and how much nostalgia I had for them all these years (decades?!) later. </p><p>However, the big star of this update, in my opinion, and why you should boot up your PS5 as soon as possible is the newly added OG PlayStation 1 boot-up video and sounds. When I restarted my PS5 console after confirming the update and installing it, I was greeted with the techno-operatic and very loud chime of the classic PlayStation boot-up logos, complete with the echo fade out of metal clinking. </p><p>Here’s what the logo looks and sounds like via a phone recording from me: </p><p>I half expected <em>Twisted Metal </em>or <em>Tony Hawk’s Pro Skater</em> to start playing after all the noises had subsided. Later, when I turned off the console to write this post, the PS5 had even updated that screen to add a little message thanking me for playing over the last 30 years. </p><p>Weirdly, while this stuff is rad and awesome, Sony says that it’s just temporary and eventually it will go away. I’m not sure why Sony would remove this stuff from PS5 as it’s a nice way to acknowledge the past and let people enjoy their expensive consoles a bit more. But what do I know? Anyway, if you want to get on this PlayStation nostalgia, don’t wait too long to boot up your PS5. </p><p> .<br></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
