              <p>The Switch 2 is quickly approaching its one-year anniversary. Nine months in, how is the game library on Nintendo’s new flagship console shaping up? Quite well. What it lacks in the big exclusives we saw during the first year of its predecessor, it’s making up for with great versions of some of the best big-budget games around, as well as perfectly timed sequels from storied indie franchises. If you’re thinking of buying a Switch 2 or already have one, here are the 12 best games to check out on Nintendo’s latest handheld hybrid.</p> <h2><a href="https://kotaku.com/final-fantasy-vii-remake-the-kotaku-review-1842697312"><b><i>Final Fantasy VII Remake Intergrade</i></b></a></h2>  <p>One of the best RPGs ever got one of the best remakes ever and the whole thing is finally on Switch 2. <em>Final Fantasy VII Remake Intergrade</em> preserves the irresistible mix of grim and goofy that seared the original into so many people’s brains while elevating its story and gameplay to new heights with beautiful cinematic setpieces and solid real-time hybrid action combat. Everything from the original’s incredible soundtrack to its story’s most unforgettable moments are reimagined and stretched out in service of a journey that feels both epic and compact. <a href="https://kotaku.com/final-fantasy-7-remake-switch-2-handheld-performance-2000661851">The Switch 2 port</a> offers all of that with even fewer compromises than expected, making <em>Final Fantasy VII Remake</em> <em>Intergrade</em> the platform’s biggest and more rewarding big-budget RPG adventure yet. — Ethan Gach</p>

 <p><strong>A good match for:&nbsp;</strong>brooding eco-terrorists who love the city in <em>Blade Runner</em> and collecting crystals.<br> <strong>Not a good match for:&nbsp;</strong>players who hate when games pause the action for lots of cutscenes.</p> <h2><a href="https://kotaku.com/kirby-air-riders-review-switch-sakurai-2000651657"><b><i>Kirby Air Riders</i></b></a></h2>  <p><em>Kirby Air Riders</em> is a tricked-out hotrod that’s as fun to tinker with as it is to drive. It’s overflowing with systems, mechanics, and stylish details, all packaged into fun and easy-to-manage bite-size morsels. What <em>Smash Bros.</em> is to fighting games, <em>Air Riders</em> is to racing games. It’s first and foremost a party game you’re meant to hang out and mess around in. Competition and heated rivalries are secondary to frenetic moment-to-moment action and a quintessentially satisfying game feel that makes every turn, boost, and attack so good, you forget that underneath all the ostentatious ornamentation there’s not a ton of depth. Who cares? Splashing in puddles can be just as fun as surfing over waves. — Ethan Gach</p>

 <p><strong>A good match for: </strong>people who wish go-karting felt more like smashing gumball machines.<br> <strong>Not a good match for: </strong>anyone who enjoys being anywhere near an actual race track.</p> <h2><a href="https://kotaku.com/star-wars-outlaws-review-size-how-big-hours-xbox-ps5-pc-1851631123"><b><i>Star Wars Outlaws</i></b></a></h2>  <p>Ubisoft’s <i>Star Wars </i>scoundrel sim <i>Outlaws</i>, like so many of the company’s big open-world games, feels a bit awkward and unrefined in spots. Enemy behavior can be too simplistic, and some of your tricks for manipulating them can make you feel more like a Jedi than a smuggler. But, in the immortal words of Han Solo, “she’s got it where it counts.” <i>Outlaws </i>puts you in the world of <i>Star Wars </i>like few games have, letting you soak up the atmosphere of backwater cantinas and more bustling city joints, claim victory at sabacc tables far and wide against some of the steeliest gamblers in the Outer Rim, and rise up the ranks of the criminal underworld as you assemble a crew for the one big job that’s gonna set you up for life. It’s also one of the most impressive games on Switch 2, where a masterful port keeps it looking great and running smooth with few visible compromises. — Carolyn Petit</p>

 <p><strong>A good match for:</strong> people who want to soak in the vibes of every bar and cantina from Tatooine to Toshara.<strong>Not a good match for:</strong> people seeking <i>Hitman </i>or <i>Metal Gear</i>-level stealth gameplay.</p> <h2><a href="https://kotaku.com/hades-ii-the-kotaku-review-2000628064"><b><i>Hades 2</i></b></a></h2>  <p><i>Hades 2</i>&nbsp;feels less like a sequel than a standalone expansion. It will never escape the shadow of the first game. But it is more&nbsp;<i>Hades</i>, a roguelike action-RPG that’s still setting the bar in each of those genres. It doesn’t feel as warm and personal and as accessible as the original, but it’s expertly balanced, beautifully presented, and still so hard to put down. — Ethan Gach</p>

 <p><strong>A good match for: </strong>fans of Greek mythology who think it needs more buildcrafting.<br> <strong>Not a good match for: </strong>folks who hate playing the same great levels over and over again.</p> <h2><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-legends-za-review-switch-2-bugs-performance-2000637719"><b><i>Pokémon Legends: Z-A</i></b></a></h2>  <p>After a year or two, every <em>Pokémon</em> game inevitably gets to a point where the community looks back fondly on it. So while there are plenty of folks still in the rage phase with this one, I’m just gonna forgo the waiting period and say that <i>Pokémon Legends: Z-A </i>is one of the best, boldest games in the long-running monster-taming series. The single-city setting allows you to hang out with one of the series’ best casts for far longer than any of previous games have, and its real-time battle system is full of new nuances and strategies you won’t find in your average turn-based <em>Pokémon</em> game. After two games, we know the <i>Legends</i> subseries has become Game Freak’s place to experiment, so it’s entirely possible the next one won’t look or play anything like <i>Z-A</i>, but it would be nice if these action systems made their way to more games. They’re too good to toss aside after just one entry. — Kenneth Shepard</p> <p><b>A Good Match For: </b>people who want a <em>Pokémon</em> experience that doesn’t feel like more of the same.<b>Not A Good Match For: </b>people who want windows to be lovingly rendered.</p>

 <h2><a href="https://kotaku.com/hollow-knight-silksong-review-hornet-team-cherry-2000639568"><b><i>Hollow Knight: Silksong</i></b></a></h2>  <p>There are no half-measures in <em>Hollow Knight: Silksong</em>. Exploration is carefully crafted and uncompromisingly exacting. Boss fights will force you to learn and improve before unblocking your path. The music is excellent, the little sound effects amazing, and every part of <em>Silksong</em>‘s gothic underground labyrinth is full of rich veins of lore and character to mine. It’s a game that thrives in the tension between limitation and mastery and never fails to reward those who soldier on no matter how often their effort and ambition is momentarily shunted.&nbsp; — Ethan Gach</p> <p><strong>A good match for: </strong>Metroidvania nerds who love exploring dangerous tunnels.<br> <strong>Not a good match for: </strong>Anyone who hates dying in Soulslikes.</p>

 <h2><em><strong>Cyberpunk 2077</strong></em><strong>&nbsp;</strong></h2>  <p>CD Projekt Red’s open-world RPG is one of the most impressive technical showcases for the Switch 2 thus far. <em>Cyberpunk 2077</em> once broke PlayStation 4s and Xbox Ones across the globe, but it runs well on Nintendo’s system. Driving around Night City is still a dream, and the Switch 2’s optional mouse controls are pretty intuitive in the game’s shooting segments. There are certainly better ways to play <em>Cyberpunk 2077</em>, but seeing it running on a Switch 2 is a reminder that while the system might seem like a pretty lowkey upgrade from the original, playing console-quality games on the go is still a novel experience eight years later. — Kenneth Shepard</p> <p><strong>A good match for: </strong>story-driven RPG fans.<br> <strong>Not a good match for: </strong>people with a weak stomach for some tough subject matter.</p> <h2><em><strong>The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild</strong></em><strong> and </strong><em><strong>Tears of the Kingdom</strong></em></h2>  <p>It’s no surprise that the two best games on the original Switch are vastly improved in their Switch 2 incarnations. <em>Breath of the Wild </em>and <em>Tears of the Kingdom </em>run at a smooth 60fps on the Switch 2, and if seeing these games running on a device that doesn’t feel like it’s struggling to keep them afloat isn’t enough, the Switch 2 editions come with new content thanks to the Zelda Notes app that adds new challenges and lore to two already dense games. If you played them before, they’re worth revisiting. If you never touched Link’s open-world adventures, they’re even more essential on the Switch 2. — Kenneth Shepard</p>

 <p><strong>A good match for: </strong>people who want peak.<br> <strong>Not a good match for: </strong>people who get overwhelmed with dense systems.</p> <h2><em><strong>Mario Kart World</strong></em></h2>  <p>Nintendo’s biggest launch title for the Switch 2 is still arguably the best game the system has to offer. <em>Mario Kart World </em>is a sublime addition to the kart racer series’ long line of quality party game staples. Though it’s not without its frustrations, <em>World </em>presents&nbsp;the chaotic, rollicking fun of throwing a blue shell down a track or barreling through your enemies as a Bullet Bill at its best. The open world is kind of empty, but it’s a fun playground to practice all the cool stunts you can do now, like riding on the wall and grinding on rails. <em>Mario Kart World </em>is all about giving you the freedom to race how you want, and that means giving you more tools, more players on the track at once, and more bothersome items to chuck at your foes. This is only the beginning, and Nintendo will likely be updating the game for years to come. <em>Mario Kart World </em>will undoubtedly be a staple of the Switch 2’s lifetime. — Kenneth Shepard</p> <p><strong>A good match for: </strong>everyone, really.<br> <strong>Not a good match for: </strong>anyone looking for something chill.</p> <h2><em><strong>Split Fiction</strong></em></h2>  <p>Hazelight’s co-op platformer <a href="https://kotaku.com/split-fiction-review-hazelight-coop-game-it-takes-two-1851767470"><em>Split Fiction</em></a> doesn’t feel built for the Switch 2. Its split-screen format makes it a pain to play in tabletop mode, so it’s really best played on a TV like you would on PS5 or Xbox. But once you’ve got it running on a big screen, the game is still a hoot. Though its cheesy writing leaves much to be desired, as a cooperative platformer with a ton of mechanical and environmental variety, it’s easily the best in Hazelight’s long line of co-op games. <a href="https://kotaku.com/split-fiction-final-level-mio-zoe-rader-ending-1851768868">That final level still whips ass, too</a>. — Kenneth Shepard</p>

 <p><strong>A good match for: </strong>someone with a friend to play with.<br> <strong>Not a good match for: </strong>someone who doesn’t have a friend to play with.</p> <h2><em><strong>Street Fighter 6</strong></em></h2>  <p>Fighting games were always going to be one of the biggest tests of the Switch 2’s technical capabilities, and Capcom thankfully managed to bring one of the best genre entries in recent years to the system without much compromise in <a href="https://kotaku.com/street-fighter-6-review-world-tour-story-mode-roster-1850481281"><em>Street Fighter 6</em></a>. Some of its Switch 2 features, like amiibo support and motion controls with the Joy-Cons, feel like cute nods to the system’s original features rather than something that fundamentally changes the game, so you’ll most likely go right back to standard play before long. Once you do, though, you’ll find a really great version of an already stellar game running at a smooth 60fps. Sure, it’s probably not going to be the version people are playing at EVO, but it’s more than good enough to break out at the function and play with friends. — Kenneth Shepard</p>

 <p><strong>A good match for: </strong>the fighting game sickos.<br> <strong>Not a good match for: </strong>people who don’t like to memorize combos.</p> <h2><em><strong>Donkey Kong Bananza</strong></em></h2>  <p>Donkey Kong and Pauline’s latest adventure is one of the Switch 2’s most impressive technical achievements. Its breakable environments are so malleable that they’re a <a href="https://kotaku.com/donkey-kong-bananza-destructible-environments-ocd-1851786630">bit of a distraction</a>, but its tight platforming, creative problem-solving, and booming personality make it one of the most joyful games on the Switch 2 right now. Is it the <a href="https://kotaku.com/switch-2-launch-lineup-single-player-mario-3d-mkw-1851784352">cultural moment the system needed to bring people in out of the gate</a>? Maybe not. But it’s still an absolute delight on its own terms. — Kenneth Shepard</p>

 <p><strong>A good match for: </strong>people who wanted <em>King Kong </em>to have a happier ending.<br> <strong>Not a good match for: </strong>people who can’t move on without finding every collectable in a level.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Counter-Strike Pros Keep Switching To This New Mouse That Lets Them Shoot Even Faster]]></title>
            <link>https://kotaku.com/x2-superstrike-mouse-logitech-valorant-counter-strike-2000670747</link>
            <guid>1439776</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><span>Usually, pro esports players are hesitant to change up their peripherals, especially before a big tournament. Getting comfortable with a new keyboard or mouse can be especially daunting when, y’know, your entire job is on the line. But a new mouse is making waves in a </span><i><span>Counter-Strike 2</span></i><span> tournament as players try to get any edge they can in the team-based shooter.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>Logitech only just released the X2 Superstrike and the new $180 gaming mouse is already becoming a fast favorite for competitive </span><i><span>Counter-Strike 2 </span></i><span>players. As pointed out by </span><a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-technology-is-just-better-why-counter-strike-pros-are-loving-a-new-mouse-that-reduces-the-time-it-takes-to-fire-their-first-shot-by-up-to-30ms"><i><span>IGN</span></i></a><span>, 13 of the ongoing PGL Cluj-Napoca tournament’s remaining 50 players have all switched over to the X2 Superstrike. Apparently no one wants to prioritize familiarity over potentially losing out on reaction time.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><span>Logitech’s website boasts that the mouse is a “breakthrough in ultra-low click-latency technology.” It uses something called a Haptic Inductive Trigger System (or HITS) instead of traditional switches to allow users to click with a lot less travel time while receiving customizable haptic feedback. Basically, it saves players even more time from the second they try to fire off a gun in an online multiplayer shooter to the instant the hit registers on the enemy player.</span></p> <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">PART 1. Here is my feedback on this mouse. It's a game changer. NO, you won't become good with this NO, but yes, the click response is faster, which I really like, and it's really great and excellent of Logitech to have created this technology. Part 2 below 🔽 <a href="https://t.co/RNQIk6L4q3">https://t.co/RNQIk6L4q3</a> <a href="https://t.co/l6XvScTLUO">pic.twitter.com/l6XvScTLUO</a></p> <p>— Polo922 (@Polo922_) <a href="https://twitter.com/Polo922_/status/2022435891852292374?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">February 13, 2026</a></p></blockquote>  <p>How much time, exactly? Up to 30 milliseconds. That’s 20 milliseconds less than the average time it takes a human to blink their eye. The <span>X2 Superstrike effectively gets you a half-blink advantage over the competition if you’re skilled enough to need it.&nbsp;</span><span>It’s probably not beneficial to casual players, but for competitive players, a more responsive mouse that can fire just a few ticks earlier can be a game-changer.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><span>According to </span><i><span>IGN</span></i><span>, Logitech apparently sped up the technology’s development after receiving encouragement from pros who tested it. This isn’t really a surprise, however, considering the fact that the X2 is basically a fancier spiritual successor to the Superlight 2, which was already a top pick for </span><i><span>CS2 </span></i><span>pros.</span></p>

 <p><span>We do know that some (if not all) of these players had access to the mouse in advance. Kscerato already won the MVP award at the Thunderpick World Championships using the mouse back in October. Still, it’s pretty impressive to see a mouse taking over a competition so quickly, especially considering that a few high-ranking teams like the Mongolz, Team Falcons, and FURIA now have half their players using the mouse.</span></p> <p><span>The X2 Superstrike is obviously a new favorite in the </span><i><span>CS2 </span></i><span>community, but I’m personally curious to see if the mouse spreads to other esports. Based on its newfound status as a hot commodity among </span><i><span>CS2 </span></i><span>pros, I could see it becoming the default gaming mouse in other competitive games like </span><i><span>Valorant </span></i><span>and </span><i><span>League </span></i><span>as well—that is, if it isn’t banned.</span></p>

            <title><![CDATA[Starfield‘s Next Big Update Isn’t A 2.0 Reboot, It’s For People Who Already Love The Game]]></title>
            <link>https://kotaku.com/starfields-next-big-update-isnt-a-2-0-reboot-its-for-people-who-already-love-the-game-2000670749</link>
            <guid>1439725</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Sorry, folks, the rumored <em>Starfield 2.0 </em>update isn’t happening. While the 2023 space RPG is getting a big update in the near future, Bethesda’s creative director Todd Howard threw cold water on the rumors of a big 2.0-like overhaul for <a href="https://kotaku.com/starfield-the-kotaku-review-1850883627"><em>Starfield</em>.</a></p> <p>On February 18, <a href="https://youtu.be/sX4rKpB97L4">as part of a larger interview with <em>Kinda Funny</em></a> about Bethesda and its games, Howard talked about what’s coming for <a href="https://kotaku.com/starfield-2-0-expansion-bethesda-ps5-2000654580"><em>Starfield</em></a>. As pointed out by host Greg Miller, he and other content creators had already seen the next big update as part of a preview event months ago, and he asked why that content was still under embargo. According to Howard, Bethesda was focused on <em>Fallout</em> and big <em>Fallout 76</em> updates last year and early this year because of the show. But now, the studio is refocusing on <a href="https://kotaku.com/starfield-exploration-astronauts-moon-boring-1851786351"><em>Starfield</em></a>.</p>

 <p>“Obviously, we’ve been working on a lot of <em>Starfield</em> content…I can tell everybody we are going to be talking about [the new content] really soon,” said Howard.&nbsp;“We’re moving into a phase where we’re ready to talk about <em>Starfield</em>. And really show that in the right way, and what’s coming to the game. We’ve been doing a lot of work that we like a lot.”</p>  <h2><em>Starfield 2.0</em> isn’t happening</h2> <p>However, Howard made it clear that folks shouldn’t expect some grand overhaul of <em>Starfield</em>, bluntly telling Miller and viewers that the update is “not <em>Starfield 2.0</em>.”</p>

 <p>“You know, I’ve seen some of that, so for expectation-setting, I think it’s the kind of thing where if you love <em>Starfield</em>, we think you’re going to love this,” explained Howard. “It’s updates and things that change the game, not in an isolated way, but sort of meta. Using outer space and things in ways that we haven’t.”</p>

 <p>Howard also acknowledged that for people who didn’t like <em>Starfield</em>, this update likely won’t change that, adding: “But look, if <em>Starfield</em> is something that didn’t connect with you right away, or you bounced off it, or found it boring in places, I don’t think this is going to change that fundamentally.”</p> <p>When Miller pushed again for a timeframe on when to expect news of this new <em>Starfield</em> update, Howard would only offer up “Soonish.”</p>

 <p>Meanwhile, Howard said that Bethesda is a “relatively small” studio and that balancing all of its roughly 250 employees across <a href="https://kotaku.com/elder-scrolls-6-is-powered-by-new-version-of-creation-engine-starfield-classic-rpg-2000670744"><em>Fallout</em>, <em>Starfield</em>, and <em>The </em><em>Elder Scrolls</em></a> is challenging. But he wanted to make it clear that Bethesda isn’t done with <em>Starfield</em>.</p> <p>“We are doing more <em>Starfield</em> stuff coming up,” said Howard. “It’s something we see continuing for a while.” <a href="https://kotaku.com/starfield-ps5-second-expansion-shattered-space-date-2000614380">Maybe that includes a PS5 port?&nbsp;</a></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>In a new interview with <em>Kinda Funny Games</em>, Bethesda creative director Todd Howard explained that <a href="https://kotaku.com/elder-scrolls-vi-6-tes6-update-release-date-bethesda-1851363646"><em>The Elder Scrolls 6</em></a> is a return to the kind of games the studio is known for and will be powered by a new version of Bethesda’s Creation Engine.</p> <p><a href="https://youtu.be/sX4rKpB97L4">In the February 18 interview livestream</a>, Howard admitted to host Greg Miller that <em>Starfield</em> and <em>Fallout 76</em> were departures from the open-world RPGs fans “expect” from them. And with <em>Elder Scrolls 6,</em> it sounds like they are going back to that “classic” style.</p>

 <p>“In many ways<em>, Fallout 76</em> and <em>Starfield</em> are a little bit of a creative detour from kind of that classic <em>Elder Scrolls, Fallout</em>, where you are exploring a world in a certain way,” said Howard.</p> <p>“As we come back to <em>Elder Scrolls 6</em> that we are doing now, we are coming back to that classic style that we’ve missed, that we know really, really well.”</p> <p>“We have a style of game we really, really like, that people expect from us, and there is a lot of innovation to be done there still, so when you step into a world you feel like you are experiencing it for the first time,” said Howard.</p>

 <p>“We’re happy with where [<em>Elder Scrolls 6</em>] is headed right now.”</p> <p>Howard also told Miller that the studio has been working hard on updating its internal engine, which has powered its past games, to help it do more with <em>Elder Scrolls 6</em> and future games.</p>

 <p>“We’ve spent the last several years bringing Creation Engine 2, which powers <em>Starfield</em>, up to Creation Engine 3, which is going to power <em>Elder Scrolls 6</em> and beyond.”</p> <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/todd-howard-elder-scrolls-vi-6-2018-e3-teaser-early-1850770820">As for when to expect <em>Elder Scrolls 6,</em> which was announced over six years ago</a>, Howard was cagey as expected, saying that while the team was close to passing a “big milestone” and development was going well, it is “going to be a while yet” before the RPG is finished.</p>
