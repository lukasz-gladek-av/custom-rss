Highlights in the patch notes include more forgiving stealth conditions in “False Flag” and other missions, fewer collisions while riding speeders, more auto-saves while playing, and scaled “wanted” difficulty based on player progression. A bunch of bugs were also addressed, while overall stability and framerate drops are also supposed to be better.</p><p>Unfortunately, the thing many players on PS5 instantly noticed after booting the game up post-update wasn’t any of these improvements but a noticeable visual downgrade with screen tearing, i.e. ripples across your TV while navigating the world and even menus. The problems are particularly bad in performance mode, which is how most people play their PS5 games. </p><p>“I loaded the game up about half an hour ago and noticed the screen tearing immediately, tried fiddling with the settings for a bit but favor quality (40fps) seems the most stable with very little screen tearing compared to the other graphic settings,” <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/StarWarsOutlaws/comments/1gb65at/screen_tearing_on_ps5/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/StarWarsOutlaws/comments/1gb65at/screen_tearing_on_ps5/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">wrote one player</a></span> on the subreddit. “I just hope this gets fixed soon as the visuals are the only thing that game really has going for it and having to deal with screen tearing is just getting in the way of enjoying the game overall.”</p><p><em>Star Wars Outlaws</em> has one more major update planned for November alongside its arrival on Steam on November 21. That patch is supposed to go even more deeply into fine-tuning combat and stealthy systems, with a Lando-based story pack and free new contract mission types also getting added that month. That’s just in time to make it an extra appealing Black Friday discount pickup for anyone who hasn’t already given the Han Solo simulator a try, at least as long as no more visual bugs get introduced along the way. </p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

The first will take place a week into the new season, which begins on December 10. Rather than a direct return to the 2-2-2 role spread of the original <em>Overwatch</em>, this test will require the team to have at least one hero of each role, but no more than three per team composition. For example, in a six-person team, you could have one tank, one DPS, and one support, and as long as those are accounted for, the other three players can freely pick whatever hero they want so long as there are no more than three per role. This way you’ll definitely have at least one person on healing and another person to tank, so a group can’t just queue up with six damage heroes.</p><p>The second test will take place midway through the season, but will “incorporate some new principles” from the sequel like incorporating hero reworks and deprioritizing crowd control abilities. With any luck, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/overwatch-2-sombra-season-13-patch-notes-ramattra-1851673081&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/overwatch-2-sombra-season-13-patch-notes-ramattra-1851673081">the Sombra revision from the current season</a></span> will have been reverted by then, but I’m not holding my breath.</p><p>In the meantime, Blizzard is also planning on a test for a new variation of its current 5v5 format that limits a team of five to two heroes per role. This means you can finally have two tanks again, but they will have the nerfs associated with the open queue format, so they won’t be quite as powerful as they are in the current, standard role-locked play. This will also include a midseason game mode codenamed “Kingmaker” that will reward any player who is the lone person in one role with a “bonus,” but they didn’t get any more specific than that.</p><p>Blizzard says it’s going to look at the reaction to these tests and determine what’s next, but the studio says there’s a possibility that both 5v5 and 6v6 could exist in the game simultaneously, which might be the best of both worlds, though it does sound like a lot to manage for a team that has seen such drastic cuts in the past year.</p><p>This is probably exactly what some folks who miss the days of the original <em>Overwatch </em>were hoping for, but I still find it hard to get too excited about <em>Overwatch 2</em> when <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/overwatch-2-anniversary-pve-story-events-skins-shop-1851665897&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/overwatch-2-anniversary-pve-story-events-skins-shop-1851665897">it’s given me so little in the past two years</a></span>. Maybe the return of folks coming back to the game to relive the glory days will be enough to rejuvenate my love for it. We’ll see when Season 14 starts in December.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

It seemed clear from the show’s start that Aubrey Plaza’s Rio Valda wasn’t exactly who she said she was. Fans had a <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/marvel-agatha-all-along-mcu-theories-wiccan-mephisto-1851656313&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/marvel-agatha-all-along-mcu-theories-wiccan-mephisto-1851656313">wide array of theories</a></span>, but they don’t have to guess any longer. As some may have suspected thanks to the show’s many hints, Rio Valda is none other than Death herself. This was most obviously hinted at in episode five when a ouija board the coven uses says that Death is in the room with them, which we now know meant Rio Valda. The revelation has an ominous note to it, as Death tells Patti LuPone’s Lilia that all roads lead to her. This is clearly implying that the coven’s journey on the Witches’ Road will lead to their deaths.</p><p>This, tragically, seems to be true, as by the end of episode seven Lilia meets her demise. Before the episode’s flashy finale, however, Patti LuPone steals the show and delivers the performance we’ve all been waiting for. The casting of LuPone was exciting for Broadway fans, as the actress is a legend of the stage known for her killer presence and voice. Given her star power, it came as a shock that LuPone takes the backseat in <em>Agatha All Along</em> for the first six episodes. Sure, she has some good quips in there, but it often felt like the show was scared to let her go all-out and risk her overshadowing the lead performances of Kathryn Hahn and Joe Locke. But in episode seven, LuPone gets to let loose.</p><p>With Agatha and Billy coming to a tentative truce after the revelations of <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/agatha-all-along-episode-6-twist-spoilers-recap-1851676452&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/agatha-all-along-episode-6-twist-spoilers-recap-1851676452">the last two episodes</a></span>, the coven find themselves in yet another trial of the Witches’ Road. This one traps them in a room with a tarot deck and a ceiling full of swords slowly pressing down toward them. The only way forward is to place the correct cards on the table, a job which falls to fortune teller Lilia. The episode then dives into how Lilia sees events take place which, due to her ability to see the past and future, occurs out of order for her. That means we get a lot of cutting back and forth between time periods as the show depicts Lilia’s disorienting life, a life that, it seems, has always been leading to this moment. Throughout it all, LuPone infuses every scene she’s in with a palpable emotion that blows her co-stars out of the water, and it all builds up to her sacrificing herself to save Agatha, Billy, and Jen. It’s a climactic conclusion to Lilia’s arc, anchored by a performance only Patti LuPone could give.</p><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://disneyplus.bn5x.net/c/379647/564546/9358?subId1=KT-&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.disneyplus.com%2Fseries%2Fagatha-all-along%2F6Nf0RIVHbJnh&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://disneyplus.bn5x.net/c/379647/564546/9358?subId1=KT-&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.disneyplus.com%2Fseries%2Fagatha-all-along%2F6Nf0RIVHbJnh" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>Agatha All Along</em> is streaming now on Disney+.</a></span> </p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
