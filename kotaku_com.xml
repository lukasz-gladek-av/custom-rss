While new inventory comes and goes on a rolling basis, places like Best Buy, Walmart, Target, and GameStop are already showing the Switch 2 as “out of stock” more often then not. </p><p>Still, Nintendo of America President Dough Bowser sought to reassure people that even if the Switch 2 becomes hard to find, it won’t be impossible to get. “We have a steady supply of manufacturing that’ll be coming in and we believe we’ll be able to meet that demand all the way through the summer, through Father’s Day, and then on into the holiday period,” he said on <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://youtu.be/3xHJ1SlyDys&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://youtu.be/3xHJ1SlyDys" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">CBS Mornings</a></span> this week (via <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/06/doug-bowser-promises-steady-supply-of-switch-2s-nate-bihldorff-plays-mario-kart-with-jimmy-fallon&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/06/doug-bowser-promises-steady-supply-of-switch-2s-nate-bihldorff-plays-mario-kart-with-jimmy-fallon" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>NintendoLife</em></a></span>), adding that stores often stagger their inventory availability instead of unleashing it all at once. </p><p>The hosts also grilled Bowser on the Switch 2's $450 price tag, the highest non-inflation adjusted price in the company’s history. He stressed that the new hardware was “built from the ground-up” with new features and better specs, pushing back against the implication that it’s an overpriced upgrade. He was <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/switch-2-ps5-pro-game-console-prices-tariffs-report-1851779765&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/switch-2-ps5-pro-game-console-prices-tariffs-report-1851779765">also asked about tariffs</a></span>, which still threaten to torpedo that pricing strategy if a current pause lapses next month. </p><p>“It’s still a very fluid and complex situation as it is for most companies,” Bowser said. “We’re continually looking at various scenarios of how we make sure we can keep our pricing as low as possible and the products as obtainable as possible. For the Switch 2 we’ve already announced we’ll be holding our pricing for $449 for the base unit and $499 for the bundle with <em>Mario Kart World</em> but we did have to take some pricing [increases] on some accessories.” </p><p>While Nintendo hasn’t released official sales figures, the Switch 2 already seems to be shaping up to be the company’s biggest new console release ever. And it’s not just the Switch 2 <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/switch-2-preorder-day-one-update-live-eshop-mario-kart-1851783549&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/switch-2-preorder-day-one-update-live-eshop-mario-kart-1851783549">flying off shelves during launch week</a></span>.

Each time Nintendo adds new dimensions to its tracks, <em>Mario Kart </em>fans find ways to do some of the sickest shit you’ve ever seen people do on four wheels. <em>Mario Kart World </em>is no different, and seeing some of the stuff people are pulling off has me champing at the bit to get behind the wheel.</p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="195905" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="Three Things We Learned From The Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth Demo " data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="121" data-playlist="195905,196599,195519" data-current="195905"><div><p>Three Things We Learned From The Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth Demo </p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195905/195905_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195905/195905_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195905/195905_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195905/195905_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/21419.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p><em>Mario Kart World </em>is a game primed for happy accidents.

All that chaos lends itself to some pretty incredible highlights. I can’t scroll through any of my social media feeds without seeing <em>World</em> players pulling off the most harebrained, improvised physical comedy, and somehow ending up near the front of the race by the time it’s over. New additions like the rewind mechanic and wall-riding have given players the tools to pull off some incredible tricks. Here are a few examples that have had me popping off and laughing my ass off.</p><p>I want it. I would like to be playing <em>Mario Kart World </em>right now, please.

It looks better and runs smoother, but perhaps the most enticing thing Nintendo has added for the new system is Zelda Notes, an assortment of voice and text logs from different characters that you can read on your phone while you play. Many of them are from the princess herself, and actually do a lot to flesh out our hero, who is typically a silent protagonist. One entry has Zelda recounting the time the two went to Eventide Island, and how Link, having been there before and being stripped of his gear, expected the same to happen to Zelda, and thus covered his eyes so he wouldn’t see anything indecent. That, my friends, is a gentleman.</p><blockquote data-type="BlockQuote"><p>‪Link came along to protect me, but he suddenly covered his eyes the moment we landed. Fortunately, it seems all the monsters vanished with the Calamity… Regardless, when I asked him what he was doing, he said last time he was here, he had been stripped of…ahem…all his possessions when he arrived. He…could have mentioned that possibility before I set foot on the shore…‬</p></blockquote><p>That’s my Hero of Time. Or whatever we’re calling him these days. <em>Tears of the Kingdom </em>is a huge game, so the prospect of going back to it feels a little daunting, even with all the Switch 2 enhancements. But I am looking forward to what other story secrets fans might find in the Zelda Notes.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Here’s each one with a brief explanation of what they do:</p><ul data-type="List" data-style="Bullet"><li><strong>Banana Peels</strong>: As one of the franchise’s original power-ups, you can always count on Banana Peels showing up. You can place these on the ground, and any players who touch them will wipe out. </li><li><strong>Blooper</strong>: You need to see the track to race on it, right? Well, use a Blooper to squirt ink on your opponents’ screen to briefly block their sight.</li><li><strong>Blue Shell</strong>: No item is more dreaded than the Blue Shell. This shell will track down and hit the leading racer, potentially causing chaos to additional racers along its path.</li><li><strong>Bob-Omb:</strong> You can really frustrate other players with a Bob-Omb. Use this power-up to set the little fella on the track so that it blows up when someone drives nearby.</li><li><strong>Boo</strong>: The Boo power-up makes you a tricky little devil. Using this item will steal another player’s item and turn you invisible briefly.</li><li><strong>Boomerang Flower</strong>: If you’re a good shot, then the Boomerang Flower can be an excellent item to have. It grants you multiple boomerang throws that can hit your opponents during the throw and on the item’s way back to you.</li><li><strong>Bullet Bill</strong>: If you need a good recovery item, Bullet Bill’s got you covered. Using this power-up transforms you into a Bullet Bill so you can dash forward while hitting any opponents in your way.</li><li><strong>Coin</strong>: The more coins you hold (up to 20), the higher your max speed becomes. As such, you’ll want to use these when you get them to, you know, get more vroom vroom.</li><li><strong>Coin Box</strong>: I think we all know what Coin Boxes do in a <em>Mario </em>game. Use this item to let you jump and hit the box for coins.</li><li><strong>Coin Shell</strong>: If you want to go faster, you need coins, and that’s where the Coin Shell comes in handy. This shell fires ahead while dropping coins for you to pick up.</li><li><strong>Feather</strong>: The Feather is a must-have for defensive play. If you learn how to master the timing on this power-up, you’ll be able to jump in the air and avoid items sent at you from other racers.</li><li><strong>Fire Flower</strong>: As one of the original power-ups from Mario canon, we all know what a Fire Flower can do. Use this item to fire off balls of fire at your foes and wipe ‘em out.</li><li><strong>Golden Mushroom</strong>: Speed is the name of the game, and Golden Mushrooms are all about it. A Golden Mushroom gives you unlimited turbo boosts for a brief period after use.</li><li><strong>Green Shell</strong>: If you’ve got a good aim, then a Green Shell can be your friend because this item will fire off ahead or behind you to hit an opponent. And if it misses, it’ll bounce off walls to create a hazard for additional drivers.</li><li><strong>Hammer</strong>: If you want to be a disruptive pest, then Hammers are for you. This power-up lets you throw hammers at your opponents with the added benefit of sticking in the track briefly as an obstacle. </li><li><strong>Ice Flower</strong>: Using the Ice Flower is cold as, uh, ice. Be a pain in the ass by freezing other racers to make them slide around the track with poor control.</li><li><strong>Kamek</strong>: Everyone loves the wizard Kamek and his magical spells, right? Well, you’ll like him better when you’re not on the receiving end of this power-up, which summons the blue-robbed foe to turn your opponents into random enemies.</li><li><strong>Lightning</strong>: Similar to the Blue Shell, the Lightning power-up is historically one of the franchise’s scariest items, letting you shrink other racers. Its duration has been nerfed a bit in this game, but it still slows folks down enough for you to make a little bit of a push ahead.</li><li><strong>Mega Mushroom</strong>: Do you like to get big and crush your foes? The Mega Mushroom lets you do just that by making your character massive so you can streamroll over anyone in your path.</li><li><strong>Mushroom</strong>: If you need a quick boost of speed, you’ll want a Mushroom. This item grants you a quick burst of speed.</li><li><strong>Red Shell:</strong> If you’ve ever played a<em> Mario Kart</em>game, you already know Red Shells are one of the best overall items. This homing shell will track down the closest foe ahead of you and wipe ‘em out.</li><li><strong>Super Horn</strong>: The Super Horn is a useful offensive and defensive tool.

It’s a chonker! Nintendo’s biggest gaming handheld yet looks familiar on paper, but makes a stronger impression in person. We’re not ready to review the new $450 gaming console just yet. That’ll take a lot more testing and game time to get familiar with all of its little changes, improvements, and quirks. Players spent more than eight years with the Switch 1. It’ll take more than eight hours to get a good handle on its successor.</p><p>But in the meantime, we’re already really enjoying our time with the <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/nintendo-switch-2-preparing-ship-late-delivery-target-1851783714&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/nintendo-switch-2-preparing-ship-late-delivery-target-1851783714">Switch 2</a></span> outside of a few annoying shortcomings and design choices that haven’t yet won us over. Calling it just a bigger, stronger Switch might sound boring, but in practice, it totally rocks. Here’s what we love and hate about the Switch 2 after our first day with it.</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="b602347dc1c820a5344900de5229c137" data-recommend-id="image://b602347dc1c820a5344900de5229c137" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Nintendo / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="b602347dc1c820a5344900de5229c137" data-recommend-id="image://b602347dc1c820a5344900de5229c137" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>The single biggest physical design difference with the Switch 2 is that the Joy-Con now snap onto the side of the console with magnets instead of sliding along a metal track, and it feels so, so satisfying. They effortlessly click in and are easy to remove without having to scrape metal on metal. The triggers to release them are also a lot easier to press than the tiny black buttons on the original Switch, too. -Ethan Gach</p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="31e41cc6e361eed7a2d14748ec06b599" data-recommend-id="image://31e41cc6e361eed7a2d14748ec06b599" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Nintendo / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="31e41cc6e361eed7a2d14748ec06b599" data-recommend-id="image://31e41cc6e361eed7a2d14748ec06b599" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>It’s really nice to have a Nintendo console that actually works with my big dumb 4K TV. Previously the Switch, for a few reasons, felt like an old relic I was plugging into my modern TV. But now, I have a Mario machine that takes advantage of the modern features of my big TV and produces a super sharp image. I can’t wait to play Nintendo games like <em>Breath of the Wild</em> and more at smoother framerates and higher resolutions. -Zack Zwiezen</p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="ea6c39be03d45612178b749402bcc6af" data-recommend-id="image://ea6c39be03d45612178b749402bcc6af" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Nintendo / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="ea6c39be03d45612178b749402bcc6af" data-recommend-id="image://ea6c39be03d45612178b749402bcc6af" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>Games load noticeably faster on Switch 2. These aren’t lightning-fast PS5 SSD speeds, but they’re a big leap compared to the old hardware. Loading <em>The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild</em> and <em>Tears of the Kingdom </em>takes only 7-8 seconds on Switch 2, roughly half what they took on the original Switch. Fast-travel in those games is roughly twice as fast as well. Even games without official Switch 2 updates are vastly improved. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://x.com/NintenTalk/status/1930656532636606865&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://x.com/NintenTalk/status/1930656532636606865" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>Animal Crossing: New Horizons</em></a></span> takes 30 seconds less on Switch 2. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://x.com/HeavyWingsDX/status/1930623920698257671&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://x.com/HeavyWingsDX/status/1930623920698257671" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>Monster Hunter Rise</em></a></span>,<em> </em><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://x.com/Lizard_yyy/status/1930543992749326434&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://x.com/Lizard_yyy/status/1930543992749326434" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>Mario &amp; Luigi: Brothership</em></a></span>, and <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://x.com/search?q=switch%202%20load%20times&amp;src=typed_query&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://x.com/search?q=switch%202%20load%20times&amp;src=typed_query" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>Pokémon Scarlet and Violet</em></a></span> have all had their load times buffed, too<em>.</em></p><p>I also tested<em> Mario Kart 8 Deluxe</em> and <em>Mario Kart World</em>.

The Switch OLED was marginally bigger and felt like having a weight lifted when I upgraded to it from my OG model. That feeling is magnified with Switch 2, which includes a much bigger screen with a smaller bezel and rim of plastic at the top and bottom. It’s not OLED, but it’s surprisingly crisp, clear, and vibrant for an LCD. It makes the original Switch feel washed out by comparison. - EG</p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="99f70fe8324ae5fbbff287e20023bccf" data-recommend-id="image://99f70fe8324ae5fbbff287e20023bccf" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Nintendo / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="99f70fe8324ae5fbbff287e20023bccf" data-recommend-id="image://99f70fe8324ae5fbbff287e20023bccf" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>I always found the Switch to feel like a kids’ toy that just so happened to play games. That’s not the case with the Switch 2. It feels incredible to hold. The buttons feel perfectly pushable, and the outer coating on the console and Joy-Con feels lovely. Not too slippery, not too rough. It also has a nice heft to it and feels substantial. It feels like a  high-end tech device and not a toy, and I really appreciate that. -ZZ</p></div><div><p>It’s been years since the Switch eShop felt anywhere close to borderline usable. It chugged like a ‘90s Windows PC loaded up with malware. Menus were sluggish, icons wouldn’t load, and half the time I just gave up looking for stuff to play and went back to my PS5 or PC instead. But on Switch 2, the eShop is once again snappy and responsive. The search bar returns way better results, and I like that the store has given wishlists and personal recommendations more emphasis on the left action bar. I also like that things are slightly more spaced out, making the whole experience feel a little less cramped. - EG</p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="11c7e90c6e75f238bad5303ccbc7ae20" data-recommend-id="image://11c7e90c6e75f238bad5303ccbc7ae20" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Nintendo / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="11c7e90c6e75f238bad5303ccbc7ae20" data-recommend-id="image://11c7e90c6e75f238bad5303ccbc7ae20" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Similar to the console and Joy-Con, the Switch 2 Pro Controller is a wonderful thing to hold and use. The buttons feel just clicky enough without feeling cheap or being too loud. The new GL and GR buttons are a great addition that will be useful in more complicated games. And the entire controller, like the Switch 2 console, just oozes high-end, luxury vibes. And it better, as it cost me nearly $100 after taxes and shit. -ZZ</p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="e16561301ad95ed9412f192f523cfcb3" data-recommend-id="image://e16561301ad95ed9412f192f523cfcb3" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Nintendo / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="e16561301ad95ed9412f192f523cfcb3" data-recommend-id="image://e16561301ad95ed9412f192f523cfcb3" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>While the eShop got a nice refresh, the rest of the Switch 2 interface, sans new features like Game Chat, looks basically identical to that of the old hardware. The home screen is still a single row of game icons surrounded by a sea of white space (or black if you use the system’s only other menu theme option). The coming back from standby screen is also the exact same, with a news bar on the left, the time at the top right, and a small icon of the last active app in the middle. </p><p>Would it kill Nintendo to add some more color options, menu themes, or background art? - EG</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="9131203652269fac7b95630b2d629c4a" data-recommend-id="image://9131203652269fac7b95630b2d629c4a" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Nintendo / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="9131203652269fac7b95630b2d629c4a" data-recommend-id="image://9131203652269fac7b95630b2d629c4a" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>For as nice as the controllers feel, they are still a horrible way to play games.

Ultimately, once we are friends, this problem isn’t a big deal, but it’s still not great. -ZZ</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="9a0f746cdb7508fb07f6bf7219e95857" data-recommend-id="image://9a0f746cdb7508fb07f6bf7219e95857" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Nintendo / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="9a0f746cdb7508fb07f6bf7219e95857" data-recommend-id="image://9a0f746cdb7508fb07f6bf7219e95857" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>The eShop is great now on Switch 2! It loads so fast, and you can quickly navigate it. However, as I did this last night, I quickly noticed that the shop was filled with all the same slop as before. And checking out the upcoming releases revealed a big tidal wave of low-priced garbage coming down the pipeline. A reminder that, while the Switch 2 is a new console, it is bringing with it a lot of baggage. -ZZ</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
