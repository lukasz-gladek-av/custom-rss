              <p><span>Leon Kennedy has become known for many things over the course of the </span><i><span>Resident Evil </span></i><span>series, including his stylish fighting style, good looks, and the fact that he cannot shut the fuck up in even the most dire of circumstances.</span></p> <p><span>The Raccoon City cop turned anti-bioterrorism agent loves to crack wise even when a zombie’s got its teeth at his neck, and my guy does not let up on that in </span><i><span>Resident Evil Requiem</span></i><span>. So I decided to take note of all his one-liners and decide which are the best ones. We won’t be getting into major story spoilers here, but in giving context to Leon’s remarks, we’ll be making vague references to some events. Here are all of his quips, ranked from the blandest to the most delightfully stupid. Reader discretion is advised.</span></p>

 <p><span><strong>“Didn’t realize I had such a big fan. How about an autograph?”</strong> – Leon after a rando enemy says he’s been waiting to fight him</span></p> <p><span><strong>“When was the last time you brushed your teeth?”</strong> – Leon, while being interrogated by an infected man with fucked-up teeth</span></p> <p><span><strong>“Funny, I don’t remember getting an invitation.”</strong> – Leon, upon being told a bioterrorist doctor he’s been tracking was expecting his arrival</span></p> <p><span><strong>“Well, that’s my cardio for the week.”</strong> – Leon after defeating a wave of zombies that cornered him in an office room</span></p> <p><span><strong>“I don’t have time for pest control.”</strong> – Leon while fighting a giant spider</span></p> <p><span><strong>“I missed that Raccoon City hospitality.”</strong> – Leon after killing a giant spider</span></p>

 <p><span><strong>“You’ll have to take the next one.”</strong> – Leon after tossing a zombie off a lift</span></p> <p><span><strong>“These pups could use more training.”</strong> – Leon as he’s pursued by mutated wolves</span></p>

 <p><span><strong>“Just a few…potholes.”</strong> – Leon, speeding over a giant gap in the road when asked how the dilapidated roads of Raccoon City are to drive on</span></p> <p><span><strong>“Must be time for the evening service.”</strong> – Leon as zombies approach a church in which Grace is hiding</span></p> <p><span><strong>“Let me guess, you’re the town lumberjack.”</strong> – Leon as a crazed chainsaw-wielding zombie approaches him</span></p> <p><span><strong>“Should’ve worn a helmet.”</strong> – Leon as someone falls off a road on a motorcycle</span></p>

 <p><span><strong>“I remember you…I remember that, too.”</strong> – Leon after being thrown against a wall by a familiar enemy</span></p> <p><span><strong>“Sorry, I was a little tied up.”</strong> – Leon after cutting rope tied around his wrists</span></p> <p><span><strong>“Sorry, but I’m not on the menu.”</strong> – Leon after blowing up a weird baby creature that kept trying to eat him</span></p> <p><span><strong>“I guess this is my stop.”</strong> – Leon after an old subway train collapses under him</span></p> <p><span><strong>“Feel like a million bucks.”</strong> – Leon, puking up blood</span></p> <p><span><strong>“I think I want a second opinion.”</strong> – Leon, as a zombified doctor murders a woman with a chainsaw</span></p>
