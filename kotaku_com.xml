              <p>It’s not every day you get to snag a fully loaded 17-inch laptop with serious muscle for less, and that’s especially true for options from known brands out there. While we’re still a couple of weeks away from Black Friday, deals on top-rated tech are coming in hot already, which makes it a great time to treat yourself to a new, powerful laptop that you can use for both work and play.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5549/">Amazon is currently being generous with a massive 71% discount on the 17.3-inch HP laptop, which brings it price down to $700.</a> This machine is packed with high-end specs, so finding it at an entry-level price like this is a rare win, and you’re even getting a bunch of useful accessories thrown in for absolutely free. It’s also one of the lowest prices we have ever seen this powerhouse drop to, and the deal is open to both Prime and non-Prime members. We just recommend getting your orders in fast, as the offer might wrap up any moment now.</p>

<h2>Immersive Visuals, Comfortable Typing Experience</h2>
<p>It’s a sleek laptop with a basic, no-fuss design. The build feels premium, and is also quite lightweight for you to carry around easily. The screen size is quite generous. For context, most options in this range offer a 15.6-inch display, so you’ve got significantly more room to work, browse, and stream here. You’ll enjoy crisp, bright visuals thanks to its HD+ IPS panel, and since it’s anti-glare, you won’t have to deal with annoying reflections when working in brighter settings.</p>
<p>Then there’s a full-sized keyboard with a lift-hinge design, which gently elevates your typing angle just a bit to ensure a comfortable position. Those who spend long hours typing won’t have to deal with sore wrists by the end of it.</p>



<p>Performance-wise, you’re covered with an Intel i3-N305 processor with 8 cores, reaching speeds up to 3.8GHz, plus a massive 32GB of DDR4 RAM. That’s enough power to push through a variety of tasks and even multitask during busy days without slowing down. For storage, you get a fast 1TB PCIe SSD. It’s got enough room to store all your important data without constantly needing an external drive.</p>
<p>Wi-Fi 6 and Bluetooth 5.4 make wireless connectivity easy, and you’re getting a wide range of ports to connect peripherals without feeling limited. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5549/">There’s a lot more to like about this laptop, especially now that it’s down to $700. Just be sure to grab yours fast, before the price shoots back up.</a></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>We already knew Hideo Kojima was working on an anime movie set in the <em>Death Stranding</em> universe,&nbsp;<a href="https://kotaku.com/hideo-kojima-physint-od-trailer-showcase-2000627889"><em>Death Stranding: Mosquito</em></a>, and <a href="https://kotaku.com/hideo-kojima-productions-death-stranding-2-od-physint-1851661289">he’d also dropped word</a> that there were other&nbsp;<em>Death Stranding-</em>based adaptions in the works. Well, now we know what at least one of them is going to be:&nbsp;<em>Death Stranding Isolations</em>, an anime TV series created for Disney Plus.</p>

 <p>Kojima’s number-one fan, Geoff Keighley, posted the news to his&nbsp;Game Awards account, stating that the seemingly very brightly-colored series would be arriving from Kojima Productions and E&amp;H Productions on Disney’s streamer some time in 2027.</p>

 <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">Death Stranding Isolations has been announced, a new anime series coming to Disney+ in 2027, from the mind of Hideo Kojima. <a href="https://t.co/gY65pFFWkh">pic.twitter.com/gY65pFFWkh</a></p> <p>— The Game Awards (@thegameawards) <a href="https://twitter.com/thegameawards/status/1988808663201640643?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 13, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <p><a href="https://deadline.com/2025/11/disney-unveils-death-stranding-isolations-from-game-creator-hideo-kojima-1236616004/"><em>Deadline</em></a>, meanwhile, has a few more details about the project, revealing that the series will be directed by&nbsp;<em>Dragon Ball Z: Battle of Gods</em>‘ Takayuki Sano, and stresses it will be using traditional hand-drawn 2D animation (which is presumably now how we say, “God, no, it’s not using AI.”) It will star the series’ main character, Sam Bridges, in a spin-off story where Bridges is attempting to save America and help others cope in their isolation. The summary continues,</p>

 <blockquote><p>“An old man is trying to realize salvation through ways outside of the connection advocated by Bridges. A female warrior is trying to kickstart a world of constant fighting. A boy holds a grudge against Bridges, and a girl has embraced her loneliness. On the precipice of the end of humanity and the world, their fates and hopes converge, as another story of <em>Death Stranding</em> begins.”</p></blockquote> <p>There’s no word on casting yet, although it would be surely impossible for anyone other than Norman Reedus to voice Bridges. It’s interesting to note that the promotional image doesn’t show him, however, instead presumably focusing on that younger boy and girl mentioned in the blurb. It seems likely that the anime will explore the lives of the individuals Bridges meets on his wobbly journeys, as he helps them reconnect. And hopefully it’ll all be super-fucking weird.</p> <p>Obviously this is still a long way off—given there’s no specific portion of 2027 mentioned, it could be as much as two years before we get to see any of it. But, unlike&nbsp;<em>Mosquito</em>, at least this seems to be showing some sort of plan for when to actually exist.</p>

              <p>Are those sleigh bells I hear? No, sir. Those are Pokéballs. December is approaching faster than a Blaziken’s Quick Attack. With the holidays right around the corner, why not have some extra fun counting down to Christmas this year? You and your family can celebrate the beginning of the holiday season with this advent calendar from Funko Pop. This set is packed with daily surprises in the form of mini Funko Pop vinyl figures of a handful of your favorite Pokémon. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5548/">Amazon usually lists the mystery box holiday calendar for $50, but ahead of Black Friday, the site has it going for 10% off.</a> That saves you a cool $5, bringing the price to just $45 for a limited time.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5548/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>



<h2>Celebrate With Your Favorite Pokémon, One Day at a Time</h2>
<p>This makes an ideal gift for Pokémon fans of all ages. Just get it to them before December, otherwise that kind of defeats the purpose of an advent calendar. How it works is the mystery box contains four rows of six small doors, each containing a beloved Pokémon character. Starting on December 1, you can peel back the layer to reveal who it is behind it waiting in vinyl Funko Pop form. One day, you’ll find Caterpie, the next you might Bulbasaur, then after that maybe Piplup. Every day for 25 days, you get to reveal a new pocket-sized friend.</p>
<p>All Pokémon included are featured right on the box. If you want to keep yourself surprised, I suggest you neither not look at it too closely nor read the following list, detailing each of the 24 Funko Pop Pokémon included:</p>
<ul>
<li>Caterpie</li>
<li>Sylveon</li>
<li>Dragonite</li>
<li>Oshawott</li>
<li>Arcanine</li>
<li>Lucario</li>
<li>Pigeotto</li>
<li>Leafeon</li>
<li>Horsea</li>
<li>Ponyta</li>
<li>Umbreon</li>
<li>Lapras</li>
<li>Munchlax</li>
<li>Psyduck</li>
<li>Charmander</li>
<li>Squirtle</li>
<li>Charizard</li>
<li>Alakazam</li>
<li>Scorbunny</li>
<li>Lapras</li>
<li>Espeon</li>
<li>Eevee</li>
<li>Pikachu</li>
<li>Bulbasaur</li>
</ul>
<p>Predictably, most featured are Gen 1 though there are some later generation favorites getting some love too. 16 are among the first Pokémon we met on our Game Boys back in 1999 while the other nine comprise of mainly later generation starters and various new Eeveelutions.</p>
<p>Each figure is smaller than the standard, popular Funko Pop figures. They measure in individually at a maximum of two inches tall. They are made from a durable vinyl materials. As collectibles, these are built to last—able to withstand daily wear of playtime too.</p>
