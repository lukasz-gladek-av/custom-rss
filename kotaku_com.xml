              <p><span>If you’ve grown up with </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-legends-za-review-switch-2-bugs-performance-2000637719"><i><span>Pokémon</span></i></a><span>, you have no doubt dreamt of waking up in the </span><i><span>Pokémon </span></i><span>universe. That’s a pipe dream, but if you can make it to Tokyo, you can get a facsimile of this experience at PokéPark Kanto, a new theme park opening on February 5. In the months since The Pokémon Company announced the attraction, we’ve </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/the-pokemon-theme-parks-first-trailer-still-doesnt-explain-anything-2000642904"><span>mostly only seen mock-ups of what the park was going to look like</span></a><span>. Well, some Japanese press and content creators finally got to see the park ahead of its grand opening and have posted videos and photos, and y’all, </span><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cph2QjATgeo"><span>I want to go to there</span></a><span>.</span></p> <p><span>The idea of PokéPark Kanto is that you’re essentially being transported to the </span><i><span>Pokémon </span></i><span>world, with statues, character actors, and photo ops all meant to immerse you in the setting. Think of it like one of the immersive experiences at Disney World, but instead of </span><i><span>Star Wars </span></i><span>characters, you’re rubbing shoulders with Pikachu and hundreds of other critters. There are several outdoor displays, but you’ll also find spots like a Pokémon Center and a professor’s lab.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><span>Despite the name, there are Pokémon from several regions, not just the Kanto setting of the original games. You can find “scenes” of Pokémon battling and interacting in the wild while others like Chansey, who stands behind the desk at the Pokémon Center, act as helpers for the staff. There’s also a shop with exclusive merchandise, and you can probably expect some of those items to end up on reseller sites in the coming weeks.</span></p> <p><a href="https://www.famitsu.com/article/202601/64249"><i><span>Famitsu</span></i></a><span> has a rundown of their experience at the park, and there’s a ton of photos of the different Pokémon on display, the different buildings and attractions you can visit, and&nbsp; the exclusive merchandise that you can buy at the shop.</span></p>

For context, Ubisoft has </span><a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/assassin-s-creed/assassins-creed-shadows-passed-5-million-players-2-billion-stealth-kills-and-most-importantly-38-million-animals-petted-which-to-ubisoft-has-delivered-on-expectations/"><span>previously stated</span></a><span> that </span><i><span>Assassin’s Creed Shadows</span></i><span> “performed within expectations,” and, as of July 2025, had amassed over 5 million players.</span></p>

 <p>Ever since <em>Shadows</em> dared include an African samurai as one of its two protagonists, it’s been the target of anti-woke attacks, <a href="https://kotaku.com/assassins-creed-shadows-yasuke-backlash-racist-elon-1851539007">including from Elon Musk</a> <a href="https://kotaku.com/assassins-creed-shadows-yasuke-backlash-racist-elon-1851539007"><span>(who was later ratio’d by whoever runs the official </span></a><a href="https://x.com/assassinscreed/status/1904648274675445938?s=20"><i><span>Assassin’s Creed</span></i></a><a href="https://kotaku.com/assassins-creed-shadows-yasuke-backlash-racist-elon-1851539007"><span> X account)</span></a><span>.</span>&nbsp;Some of those same people have now been saying the company’s financial fallout vindicates their attacks on diversity and inclusion in gaming.</p> <p><span>Shimoda, who worked for the publisher from 2021 to 2024, stated “unequivocally” that Ubisoft’s DEI initiatives “didn’t wield that much influence” and were, in fact, “actually beneficial” in helping them expand in South America and the Middle Eastern territories.</span></p>

 <p><span>His comments regarding Ubisoft’s “excessively low turnover rate” and “lack of senior/lead-level staff with experience” imply that Shimoda lays the blame squarely at the feet of the publisher’s upper management, especially when paired with his “Big Business Syndrome” remark.</span></p>

 <p><a href="https://www.omron.com/global/en/about/corporate/history/founder/06/"><span>Big Business Syndrome</span></a><span> is a term coined by Kazuma Tateisi, former president of Japanese electronic manufacturer OMRON, in 1987. In short, Tateisi believed that the profits of several prominent Japanese companies in the 80s began to fall once their leaders became too obsessed with maintaining the status quo. When stepping down as president in 1987, Tateisi warned OMRON employees that refusing to pursue the same riskier strategies that led to their initial success, yet continuing to expand in the process, would lead to them suffering the same fate as their contemporaries.</span></p> <p><span>Shimoda is arguing that Ubisoft has become a victim of the same mentality. </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/ubisoft-cancels-long-delayed-prince-of-persia-remake-black-flag-remake-delay-2000661866"><span>On January 21</span></a><span>, the publisher announced a painful shakeup that included the cancellation of “4 unannounced titles, including 3 new IP’s” and the formation of “Five Creative Houses” that will solely focus on developing games for their pre-existing IPs. But some current employees feel like this latest reset is just history repeating itself.&nbsp;</span></p>

            <title><![CDATA[I Have A Resident Evil Requiem Theory, And I Hope I’m Wrong]]></title>
            <link>https://kotaku.com/resident-evil-9-requiem-leon-infection-dead-dies-theory-2000663084</link>
            <guid>1416331</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><span>I <a href="https://kotaku.com/resident-evil-9-requiem-preview-leon-gameplay-grace-2000662270">played about three hours of </a></span><i><span><a href="https://kotaku.com/resident-evil-9-requiem-preview-leon-gameplay-grace-2000662270">Resident Evil Requiem</a> </span></i><span>earlier this month, and I could not shake the feeling that I know where the rest of the game is going to go when it launches next month. Though I have not seen enough of the ninth entry in Capcom’s long-running horror series to be sure, I’ve got a theory, and it’s one that some fans have independently come to as well after combing through the trailers. There’s nothing in the time I played that outright confirms this is the way things are going to go, but there are clues that I’ve started latching onto. If you don’t want your experience of </span><i><span>Requiem</span></i><span> to be influenced even by speculation about where the story </span><i><span>might </span></i><span>go, turn back now.</span></p>  <p><span>I think Leon Scott Kennedy, one of </span><i><span>Resident Evil</span></i><span>’s long-time protagonists, is going to be dead by the end of </span><i><span>Resident Evil Requiem</span></i><span>. Now, I know what you’re thinking. “Capcom would never kill one of </span><i><span>Resident Evil</span></i><span>’s recurring leads.” And yeah, we are in uncharted territory. Take my hand and follow me down this dark passageway toward the worst-case scenario.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><span>In my time playing </span><i><span>Requiem</span></i><span>, I learned something that astute fans have already picked up on: Leon has </span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ResidentEvilCapcom/comments/1pmsq1z/leon_is_100_infected_in_this_game_leon_in_this/"><span>some kind of deadly infection</span></a><span>. He’s looking for a cure, which is why he ends up in the Rhodes Hill Chronic Care Center where his </span><i><span>Requiem</span></i><span> co-lead Grace Ashcroft has been taken. The infection manifests in a gnarly wound on his neck, but whatever’s going on, he still has time before he turns. How much time? That’s unclear right now. But that infection is only half the reason I think Leon is going to be pushing daisies by the end of </span><i><span>Requiem</span></i><span>.</span></p> <p><span>The game’s name, </span><i><span>Requiem</span></i><span>, has a few different meanings, both in and out of the context of the game. A requiem, </span><a href="https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/requiem"><span>as the dictionary describes it</span></a><span>, is a “mass for the dead,” or some kind of musical tribute to the dead. Yes, this could be in reference to Grace’s mother Alyssa Ashcroft, </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/resident-evil-requiem-9-grace-trailer-gamescom-mother-2000618547"><span>whose death is an inciting incident</span></a><span> in the story, but it also has a very specific meaning attached to it that links Leon and Grace. Early on in the section I played, Leon and Grace meet, and the ex-Raccoon City cop gives Grace a powerful revolver named Requiem. Though I only had one bullet for it in Grace’s resource-scarce segment, it did blow a hole right through a zombie’s head, so thank you, Leon, for saving my ass with your gift of foresight. However, this moment could also be seen as a literal passing of the torch (or gun) to a new generation of </span><i><span>Resident Evil </span></i><span>heroes, and that’s something Capcom has been pretty upfront about in its marketing.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">Two generations of survival. Grace Ashcroft and Leon S. Kennedy face unimaginable terrors in Resident Evil Requiem.</p> <p>🌿<a href="https://t.co/JBHl3u25qT">https://t.co/JBHl3u25qT</a> <a href="https://t.co/NrcAVXDNTf">pic.twitter.com/NrcAVXDNTf</a></p> <p>— Resident Evil (@RE_Games) <a href="https://twitter.com/RE_Games/status/1999317087034950074?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 12, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <p><span>Grace’s playstyle is defined by her inexperience. A gun that wrecks shop in Leon’s hand barely harms a zombie when Grace is using it. This is her origin story, and while she and Leon might be separated for large parts of the game, she has his gun, whose name literally means a tribute to the dead, on her at all times. From a thematic standpoint, Leon entrusts something to her, and parts from her fully realizing he may never see her or the revolver again. I would not be surprised if </span><i><span>Requiem </span></i><span>ended with Leon doing something to save Grace, ensuring she gets out of this whole outbreak alive and earning himself a big goddamn hero’s sacrifice, knowing that he was on borrowed time anyway. Grace escapes, but still has the Requiem revolver in hand, and uses it as a tribute to her fallen comrade in future cases. See? It all comes full circle.</span></p>

 <p><span>That’s all speculation, but if </span><i><span>Requiem </span></i><span>is really meant to be a generational shift for </span><i><span>Resident Evil</span></i><span>, it would make a lot of sense for Capcom to sell that in the most definitive way possible. But hey, characters like Leon, Chris, and Jill have gotten through worse, so I also wouldn’t be surprised if he manages to squeeze his way out of this problem, too. We’ll find out for sure when </span><i><span>Resident Evil Requiem </span></i><span>launches on February 27.</span></p>
