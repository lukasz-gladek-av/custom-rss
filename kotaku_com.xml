Then, in April 2023, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://archive.is/2023.07.03-160323/https://www.gq.com/story/david-zaslav-warner-bros-discovery-ceo-tcm-max&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://archive.is/2023.07.03-160323/https://www.gq.com/story/david-zaslav-warner-bros-discovery-ceo-tcm-max" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">WB Discovery CEO and dingus David Zaslav</a></span> announced that it was dropping the HBO branding from the service and it would just be called Max. After the announcement, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Max_(streaming_service)#cite_note-62&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Max_(streaming_service)#cite_note-62" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">WB’s stock dropped by six percent</a></span> and people mostly laughed at the new name and kept using the old one. Then, in February, WB rebranded Max’s logo from blue to black, seemingly signaling a return to the HBO branding. And now here we are. HBO Max is back after millions of wasted dollars. </p><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://press.wbd.com/us/media-release/max/warner-bros-discovery-announces-max-become-hbo-max-summer&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://press.wbd.com/us/media-release/max/warner-bros-discovery-announces-max-become-hbo-max-summer" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">On May 14, WB Discovery announced</a></span> that it was bringing back the HBO Max name this summer because “consumers” now demand “better” content, not just “more” content. Fun fact: <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.theverge.com/2023/4/12/23673475/warner-bros-discovery-max-new-name-hbo&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/4/12/23673475/warner-bros-discovery-max-new-name-hbo" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Back in 2023</a></span>, after dropping HBO from the brand, the reason given was because they wanted people to not assume it was just premium adult content. Anyway, here’s some corpo blabble that will make you roll your eyes so hard they might fall out of your head. </p><p>“Returning the HBO brand into HBO Max will further drive the service forward and amplify the uniqueness that subscribers can expect from the offering. It is also a testament to WBD’s willingness to keep boldly iterating its strategy and approach—leaning heavily on consumer data and insights—to best position itself for success.”</p><p>Ahh, yes, what a bold strategy! Taking a name that was popular, recognized, liked, and successful, and tossing it into the bin because you completed a big merger and suddenly had new execs wanting to shake things up and be a part of the process. Then, after that new name flopped and everyone mostly igorned it anyway, you sneak back out to the garbage, clean up the old name, and bring it back with a big press release that touts how HBO is a brand connected to quality and prestige. Makes you wonder why you ditched it to begin with? </p><p>Now, let’s all think about how much money was spent on this stupid process and how the richest people in the world running these companies aren’t good at their jobs. Welcome back, HBO Max. You shouldn’t have been killed in the first place. </p><p> .<br></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

I am told, by just about every single person in my life, that I should be using a mechanical keyboard, with removable switches, clickity-clackity sounds, and probably enough neon lighting to open a nightclub. I do not. I use a Microsoft MultiMedia Keyboard 1.0A, with a blob of Blu-Tac over the Num Lock LED, and I have done so for as long as I can remember. And as of today, I’m down to my last one. When this one goes, that’s it. I’m done.</p><figure id="" data-id="e919d42bb401a06493cea7a3fded7e08" data-recommend-id="image://e919d42bb401a06493cea7a3fded7e08" data-format="jpg" data-width="967" data-height="544" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A dead keyboard, lying on its belly on a towel." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A dead keyboard, lying on its belly on a towel." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Photo<!-- -->: <!-- -->John Walker / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="e919d42bb401a06493cea7a3fded7e08" data-recommend-id="image://e919d42bb401a06493cea7a3fded7e08" data-format="jpg" data-width="967" data-height="544" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A dead keyboard, lying on its belly on a towel." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>I’m not ashamed, and you’re not going to make me ashamed. The Microsoft MultiMedia Keyboard 1.0A is the best keyboard ever made. First created in 1997, its keys press with a whisper-quiet “shddd” and that is perfection. Yes, it has the most ludicrous array of “media” buttons across the top in a fancy arch, and no, I’ve never pressed one of them once in the twenty-ish years I’ve been using this keyboard. And no, this isn’t the “Natural” ergonomic version, it’s the regular-shaped one. I’m not a sicko.</p><p>I have had friends and co-workers react with genuine horror upon hearing of my use of this device. To not be part of the mechanical cult is, apparently, shun-worthy, and I accept that you too, reader, are now thinking even less of me. But worry not, for of the pile of six of these keyboards I bought when I heard they were no longer going to be manufactured, the one I’ve attached via its PS/2 cord to my PC today is my last. And after this one dies, I feel like retirement is my only option.</p><p>You know those authors who say that they write their books out long-hand, using the fountain pen they inherited from their great-great grandmother, and then some poor lackey has to type them up for the publisher? Or the writers who insist on using a 1930s Royal P typewriter, because they’re incapable of composing their prose on anything else? That’s me. Pretentious, dumbass me. The magic’s not in my heart, it’s in the Microsoft MultiMedia 1.0A.</p><p>(Look, I know, there’s controversy here that I’m not addressing. The official Microsoft data sheet for the keyboard calls it a “1.0a,” but the device itself says “1.0A,” and I won’t be budged from that capitalization. Sorry, you’ll just have to be offended.)</p><p>This is the keyboard on which I’ve composed my greatest works.

It’s the keyboard on which I finished <em>Dishonored 2</em>, and the means by which I conquered <em>Titanfall 2</em>. I’m far better at <em>Fortnite</em> on these keys than I am on my Xbox. This is how I spent those billions of hours in <em>Skyrim</em>. This keyboard is vital to my gaming life!</p><p>Over the years, I’ve been through so many makes of PCs, mice, monitors and speakers, but the keyboard has always remained the same. For years, I had to use a USB adaptor to plug the PS/2 cable in, although right now (because fate knows best) my current PC actually has a classic purple port right on the motherboard. I have literally no idea why. Surely there’s no one else this stupid?</p><figure id="" data-id="f5a2623becea03076327bdf1913928c4" data-recommend-id="image://f5a2623becea03076327bdf1913928c4" data-format="jpg" data-width="1042" data-height="587" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A new keyboard in its cardboard box." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A new keyboard in its cardboard box." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Photo<!-- -->: <!-- -->John Walker / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="f5a2623becea03076327bdf1913928c4" data-recommend-id="image://f5a2623becea03076327bdf1913928c4" data-format="jpg" data-width="1042" data-height="587" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A new keyboard in its cardboard box." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>But it feels right! Maybe you have a favorite make of running shoes that you insist on buying, because everything else makes your feet feel funny. (You should try barefoot shoes though, trust me.) Perhaps there’s a cushion you put on the driver’s seat of every car? A favorite pillow without which going to sleep is significantly harder? That’s my 1.0A. It feels exactly the right shape under my fingers, the keys are perfectly spaced apart for my hands, and the wrist rest clips on the front in a way that makes all other keyboards feel like a form of gentle torture.</p><p>Time is certainly not on my side. Despite the mysterious PS/2 port, Windows doesn’t like this keyboard very much any more. The first thing I do each time I crack open a new one (usually because either the one I’m using has become as clickity-clackity as your ghastly mechanical setup, or because—as with today—I’ve murdered the last one with liquid) is fix the crummy delay when holding down a single key. Except, in the ten minutes I spent looking before I started writing this, I have been unable to find the key delay settings in Windows! They’re gone! I just misspelt “They’re” and when I held down Backspace to fix it, it took a near interminable half a second to begin clearing the mistake. I’m searching on Google for a solution, and most of the results are, “Are you OK? Do you need anything?”</p><figure id="" data-id="e5a829273329b1a945225e2f2c0f82b8" data-recommend-id="image://e5a829273329b1a945225e2f2c0f82b8" data-format="jpg" data-width="1128" data-height="634" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The new keyboard in all its glory, complete with Blu-Tac over the light." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="The new keyboard in all its glory, complete with Blu-Tac over the light." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Photo<!-- -->: <!-- -->John Walker / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="e5a829273329b1a945225e2f2c0f82b8" data-recommend-id="image://e5a829273329b1a945225e2f2c0f82b8" data-format="jpg" data-width="1128" data-height="634" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The new keyboard in all its glory, complete with Blu-Tac over the light." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>“So just buy a new one,” you might say, before realizing that it’ll only encourage me to keep working. Oh, poor sweet fool, if only it were that simple. When these things were new, they cost like $20. They were so gloriously cheap. When I bought that batch of six in 2013, it cost me $40 (plus $25 shipping!). That’s the greatest bargain of my life. Less than $11 a keyboard, and they’ve kept me going for 12 beautiful years. But right now, when I look on eBay, I’m finding <em>used</em> ones for $90! <em>USED! </em>(And to make matters worse, it’s listed as “Vintage.” It’s not fucking vintage! It’s as old as <em>Fight Club</em>. That is not a vintage film.)</p><p>In the last couple of years, when looking to find more back-ups, I’ve never seen a new one on sale for less than $100, which is ludicrous. Today, however, the best price for a new, unused version I’ve found <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.ebay.co.uk/itm/235994418826&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.ebay.co.uk/itm/235994418826" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">is £32</a></span> ($43) and maybe I have to pay that? What’s that—a quarter of the cheapest mechanical keyboard you’d consider buying? <em>Outrageous</em>. Is my career worth this much?</p><p>OK, fine, I just bought it, alongside a second one I found for $20 that claims to be unused, but I’m suspicious. And with that, I’ve bought <em>all</em> the “new” 1.0As available on UK eBay. (PayPal was so suspicious of this activity that on buying the second one it sent alerts to my phone to make sure my account hadn’t been hacked by a deranged, 150-year-old criminal.) I refuse to believe there aren’t Microsoft warehouses filled with forgotten pallets of these things, lurking in a dark corner behind the crates holding Arks of the Covenant. Honestly, at this point I should be part of some ambassador program, appointed by Microsoft to herald the greatest moment in the company’s history, before it got distracted all over again by being evil.</p><p>And I still don’t care what you think. It’s so lovely to be on a brand new one of these lovely keyboards, the keys especially thuddy, the gaps between them not containing concerning amounts of fluff, and the insides entirely free of coffee and soda. I just need to figure out how to let it let me delete my mistakes more quickly, and I’m a happy boy. Until they’re all gone, that is, although I somewhat suspect that’ll be more than the universe can take, and everything else will go with it.</p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
