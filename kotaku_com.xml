But some heroes can just shut down several ultimates in the game; it’s just a matter of timing, precision, and situational awareness to ensure it’s worth the risk when you could, instead, just run away.</p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="193348" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="God Of War Is Still The GOAT For Opening Boss Fights" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="223" data-playlist="193348,197298,197284" data-current="193348"><div><p>God Of War Is Still The GOAT For Opening Boss Fights</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/193348/193348_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/193348/193348_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/193348/193348_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/193348/193348_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/18794.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>Fans have been trying out several of the game’s stun-based abilities against different ultimates, and discovered that several heroes on the roster can deny enemy players all that value with the press of a button. Some of them are pretty simple, such as Luna Snow freezing Scarlet Witch out of her Reality Erasure attack.</p><p>Others require much more precision and game sense, like using Cloak &amp; Dagger’s Dark Teleportation ability to briefly make your team invulnerable right as <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/marvel-rivals-jeff-the-land-shark-ultimate-ability-1851716962&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/marvel-rivals-jeff-the-land-shark-ultimate-ability-1851716962">noted menace Jeff the Land Shark</a></span> tries to gobble them up and spit them off the map.</p><p>Timing really is everything with some of these strategies. Several heroes’ ultimate abilities have a brief startup animation before they get real crazy and can’t be stopped. Characters with crowd control abilities, like Wolverine and Peni Parker, can stop most ults if they strike just before the enemy executes the attack, and doing so will often come down to the stars aligning. The ability can’t be on cooldown, of course, and you have to have the perfect line of sight to strike. But if you’re going to play heroes who have that utility, it’s a good skill to have in your arsenal.</p><p>A lot of these shutdowns will become second nature as you memorize ultimate voice lines and are on the receiving end of every attack. Anticipating when your foe’s about to drop theirs is a big part of canceling a possible team wipe. This also comes with time, as you’ll get a sense of when enemies have likely racked up enough damage or healing to charge their ultimate. Then you’ll know what positioning to look for as enemies set up their attacks. You’ll see an Iron Man who tries to flank your team to surprise you with an Invincible Pulse Cannon, for instance, or Thor leaping into the air before he slams his hammer down. You can spend some time in the training range to see what abilities you can actually stop, but nothing will replace the practice of getting into casual matches and trying them out naturally. Then you’ll be ready to take those skills into competitive play.</p><p>For more on <em>Marvel Rivals</em>, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/marvel-rivals-review-hero-shooter-overwatch-netease-1851717975&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/marvel-rivals-review-hero-shooter-overwatch-netease-1851717975">check out <em>Kotaku</em>’s review</a></span>.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

It stands for “Second Valuable Player.” A few games here and there have used it, namely some MOBAs like <em>League of Legends: Wild Rift</em>, but it isn’t the most common gaming phrase. It is fortunately an easy concept to understand, and one worth knowing when it comes to ranked play. Let’s break down what SVP means in <em>Marvel Rivals</em>.</p><h2 id="h173172"><a id="svp"></a>What is SVP?</h2><figure id="" data-id="9486f2106988401fd4cb7b3f41e1d0a2" data-recommend-id="image://9486f2106988401fd4cb7b3f41e1d0a2" data-format="jpg" data-width="3840" data-height="2160" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The Post-Match result screen shows a defeated team with Jeff the Land Shark as the SVP." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="The Post-Match result screen shows a defeated team with Jeff the Land Shark as the SVP." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Marvel Games / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="9486f2106988401fd4cb7b3f41e1d0a2" data-recommend-id="image://9486f2106988401fd4cb7b3f41e1d0a2" data-format="jpg" data-width="3840" data-height="2160" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The Post-Match result screen shows a defeated team with Jeff the Land Shark as the SVP." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>The MVP is always the best-performing player on the winning team. <strong>On the flip side is the SVP, or Second Valuable Player, who is the best performer on the losing team.</strong> Even though they lost, they’re highlighted for putting in the most work among their teammates.</p><p>SVP is likely awarded on the same merits that MVP would be. The Ace players for each team are likely the ones that will be awarded MVP and SVP in the end. <strong>Here are some general guidelines to improve your chances of being considered the best on your team</strong>:</p><ul data-type="List" data-style="Bullet"><li>Spending time on the match’s objective is key for everyone.</li><li>Blocking damage is an important duty for Vanguards.</li><li>Getting the most kills isn’t always the most important thing in a team game, but it is what Duelists should aim for.</li><li>Healers are vital for every team, so Strategists should heal as much damage as possible.</li></ul><p>The SVP title doesn’t mean much in regular quick matches besides earning some kudos for doing your best. When it comes to Competitive Play, however, it does have a functional purpose that everyone on the losing team will want: Hanging onto more Ranked points.</p><h2 id="h173173"><a id="avoid"></a>How to avoid losing Rank with SVP<br></h2><p>The Rank system in <em>Marvel Rivals</em> is pretty simple. When it comes to progress, your Rank will increase with every win and decrease with every loss. There is one small consolation though—<strong>the SVP in a Competitive match loses fewer Ranked points</strong>. </p><p>Although there is no way to prevent the entire team from dropping their Rank, the best player on the losing team can at least receive a more lenient deduction. It’s a great way to motivate you to try your hardest during the most difficult situations. You should be aiming to win no matter what, but it’s still nice to know you might have a saving grace waiting if you do really well despite losing the match.</p><p>SVP isn’t as flashy as MVP, but earning the title is still a great accomplishment in <em>Marvel Rivals</em>. You’ll need to take your role seriously and be a real team player to be the best for either team. If you want to know how else to be an asset to your allies, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/marvel-rivals-hero-shooter-overwatch-team-attacks-how-1851718182&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/marvel-rivals-hero-shooter-overwatch-team-attacks-how-1851718182">Team-Up Abilities</a></span> can make a difference. <em>Marvel Rivals</em> is available for free on PS5, Xbox Series X/S, and Windows.</p><p>.<br></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

If you long for <em>Titanfall 3</em>, you should stop reading this and play <em>Echo Point Nova.</em></p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="2cb6b721c587b94c3a457fe51c7a191d" data-recommend-id="image://2cb6b721c587b94c3a457fe51c7a191d" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="A screenshot of Mullet Madjack.

It’s a fast-paced, hyper-linear, action-packed FPS built around killing rich robots as quickly as possible. In <em>Mullet Madjack </em>you use not only guns but also your fists, feet, and melee weapons to massacre wealthy androids while you livestream it to your in-game audience. They always want more murder, and I’m always happy to oblige them because it feels great to kill some robot CEOs with a shotgun in <em>Mullet Madjack. </em></p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="af61840617cf30d04f22bf1e7cef6365" data-recommend-id="image://af61840617cf30d04f22bf1e7cef6365" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="An image shows heroes from Marvel Rivals.

Many characters in the game, like Punisher and Black Widow, use guns, and others, like Hela, use ranged magic attacks. But then still <em>others</em>, like Hulk and Wolverine, are strictly melee. Personally, I think there are enough shooter-y vibes and gameplay elements in <em>Rivals </em>for it to make the list. </p><p>What I love about <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/marvel-rivals-review-hero-shooter-overwatch-netease-1851717975&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/marvel-rivals-review-hero-shooter-overwatch-netease-1851717975"><em>Marvel Rivals</em></a></span><em> </em>is how powerful characters feel. Jumping into a group of enemy players as Venom, taking most of them out, and then hopping away feels good. On the flip side, when I see a Venom try to do that and I’m playing as Black Widow, I just smile and snipe that gooey bastard from afar. Everyone is powerful. Everyone feels dangerous in the right hands. Is this balanced? Probably not. But that’s why it’s so much fun! </p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="3679f2c2ff5f1b6c4469e01c97f7307e" data-recommend-id="image://3679f2c2ff5f1b6c4469e01c97f7307e" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="A screenshot of Sulfur.

I sort of suck at <em>Sulfur</em>, but I still keep coming back to play more.

Well, because Epic has greatly expanded the shooty-shooty bang-bang bits of <em>Fortnite</em>, helping it secure a spot here one more time. </p><p>In the last 12 months, Epic has added <em>Fortnite OG, Reload, </em>and <em>Ballistic</em> to the game.

Other additions, like the horde mode Onslaught, showed <em>Destiny 2</em> is still at its best when friends are just shooting tons of aliens together and collecting tons of loot for doing so. Fans got a great raid this year and another great dungeon, and while updates are buggier and <em>Destiny 2</em>'s future more up in the air than ever, the bones of this shooter are still some of the best around. - Ethan Gach</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="af0afef05a859b033c734410a93596ba" data-recommend-id="image://af0afef05a859b033c734410a93596ba" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="A screenshot of Dark Forces Remaster.
