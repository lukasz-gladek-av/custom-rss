              <p>The decline in Xbox hardware revenue has become so predictable you could <a href="https://kotaku.com/starfield-bethesda-xbox-game-pass-watch-special-edition-1850527638">set your <em>Starfield</em> watch to it</a>. Microsoft reported its second-quarter earnings on Wednesday and, yes, console sales are down yet again. But the rest of the gaming division didn’t have a such a hot holiday either. The company is blaming year-over-year declines on the lack of strong releases near the end of 2025. Hmmm.</p> <p>“Xbox content and services revenue declined 5 percent (down 6 percent CC) on a prior year comparable that benefited from strong first-party content performance,” reads the company’s <a href="https://view.officeapps.live.com/op/view.aspx?src=https://microsoft.com/en-us/investor/earnings/FY-2026-Q2/Document/DownloadDocument/141/SlidesFY26Q2.pptx">latest earnings presentation</a>. “Xbox hardware revenue declined 32 percent.”</p>

 <p>But last year’s numbers weren’t exactly stellar. The gaming division <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/xbox-revenue-fell-7-in-q2-as-hardware-sales-dropped-29/">saw a 7 percent decline</a> overall in the second quarter. Xbox hardware was down 29 percent this time in 2025, while content and services were only up 2 percent. Holiday 2024 had <em>Indiana Jones and the Great Circle</em> and <em>Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024</em> but was otherwise quiet.</p> <p>Holiday 2025, on the other hand, saw the release of <em>Ninja Gaiden 4 </em>and&nbsp;<em>The Outer Worlds 2</em>, while<em> Flight Sim</em> came to PS5. Also the underperforming <em>Call of Duty: Black Ops 7</em> which, combined with a major Game Pass price hike, might have led to a spike in churn. We don’t know, though, because Microsoft still isn’t releasing new subscriber numbers.</p>

 <p>All we know for sure is that the Xbox Series X/S is an ever-shrinking part of the equation for Microsoft Gaming and the company in general. And it’s been that way <a href="https://kotaku.com/xbox-series-x-s-sales-microsoft-next-gen-exclusives-1850375665">almost every year</a> <a href="https://kotaku.com/xbox-ps5-sales-exclusivity-starfield-microsoft-1851436748">since the consoles launched</a>. The company has promised <a href="https://kotaku.com/xbox-next-gen-backwards-compatibility-microsoft-pc-2000644836">new hardware</a> but the priorities of the evolving Xbox platform seem to increasingly lie beyond it.</p>

 <p>With the AI arms race led by Microsoft and others spiking <a href="https://kotaku.com/intel-cpu-production-pivot-ai-data-centers-shortages-increase-price-ram-memory-pc-2000663095">gaming hardware costs in the near term</a>, maybe that’s for the best.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Former 2K Boss Leaves Amazon Game Studios As It Pivots To Party Slop]]></title>
            <link>https://kotaku.com/2k-christoph-hartmann-amazon-studios-crucible-2000663900</link>
            <guid>1419112</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>The boss of Amazon Game Studios is out. VP Christoph Hartmann is leaving the company according to <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/jasonschreier.bsky.social/post/3mdisznjdh22x"><em>Bloomberg</em>‘s Jason Schreier</a>. It’s another big blow to another tech giant that once had <a href="https://kotaku.com/new-world-mmo-servers-rust-facepunch-amazon-2000660558">big ambitions for gaming</a>.</p> <p>Hartmann was a cofounder of 2K Games and served as the <em>BioShock</em> and <em>Borderlands</em> publisher’s <a href="https://kotaku.com/how-the-makers-of-mafia-iii-lost-their-way-1825242177">president up until he left in 2017</a>. He joined Amazon a year later to lead a range of studios working on games like the MMO <em>New World</em>, which is now set to go offline in January 2027.</p> <p>“Gaming, today’s favorite form of entertainment in the world, is connecting hundreds of millions of people,” Hartmann said <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/former-2k-games-president-christoph-hartmann-joins-amazon-games">when joining Amazon back in 2018</a>. “Between the teams at AGS, the incredible tools and technology from AWS, the global communities of Twitch and Twitch Prime, and all of the other assets around Amazon, there are few companies in the world set up to take gaming to the next level.”</p>

 <p>Unfortunately, Amazon never managed to bring those tools together, or the other resources at its disposal, to deliver a lasting hit in the ultra-competitive gaming space. One of its projects was a 2020 hero shooter <a href="https://kotaku.com/amazons-crucible-flopped-so-hard-its-being-un-released-1844222299">by Relentless Studios called<em> Crucible</em></a>. If you don’t remember it, that’s because a few months after its release it was “unreleased,” and eventually canceled.</p> <p>Amazon signaled it was shifting away from AAA game development last fall amid massive cuts across the company. It still hasn’t confirmed the status of a previously announced <a href="https://kotaku.com/amazon-layoffs-lord-rings-mmo-tomb-raider-2000639620"><em>Lord of the Rings</em> MMO</a>, though one of its developers said <a href="https://kotaku.com/amazon-lord-rings-mmo-resident-evil-switch-2-pro-controller-2000640104">the team working on it was also laid off</a>, and remains slated to publish the upcoming<em> Tomb Raider</em> games, including this year’s reboot of the original.</p>

 <p>But to the extent that Amazon is still meaningfully invested in gaming, it seems to be mostly focused on its cloud gaming platform Luna. It shifted gears last fall to focus on party games like a courtroom comedy <a href="https://kotaku.com/amazon-failed-game-streaming-service-luna-pivots-snoop-dogg-ai-2000630696">featuring an AI Snoop Dogg</a>. Hartmann and Amazon did not immediately respond to requests for comment.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Emberville Is A Mash-Up Of Diablo And Stardew Valley That Has Our Attention]]></title>
            <link>https://kotaku.com/emberville-diablo-stardew-valley-rpg-life-sim-trailer-2000663882</link>
            <guid>1419097</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><span>Farming is great, but what if you also want to grind through action-RPG dungeons for cool loot? </span><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2295170/Emberville/"><i><span>Emberville</span></i></a><span> is seemingly the answer. The upcoming life sim is pitched as a cross between </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/diablo-ii-resurrected-is-mostly-just-diablo-ii-for-be-1847741744"><i><span>Diablo</span></i></a><i> </i><span>and </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/stardew-valley-concerenedape-haunted-chocolatier-update-1851778392"><i><span>Stardew Valley</span></i></a>. A new look at gameplay makes the formula seem pretty compelling.</p> <p><span>Earlier this week, indie studio Cygnus Cross shared the official announcement trailer for </span><i><span>Emberville</span></i><span>, which is now slated to launch in early access this summer. The announcement came alongside the reveal of some of its star-studded voice cast, which is especially exciting considering the fact that it’s a pixel art indie game. </span></p>

 <p><span>Doug Cockle (best known as Geralt from </span><i><span>The Witcher</span></i><span>)</span><span> and Alex Jordan (who can be heard as Mr. Hands in </span><i><span>Cyberpunk 2077</span></i><span>)</span><span> are on board, with Jordan also serving as the voice director. In a press release, the team also teased that it’ll be revealing a “literal all-star cast” over the next few months, which is a big promise to make after already having Geralt himself on board.</span></p>  <p><span>While </span><i><span>Emberville </span></i><span>was quietly revealed back in 2023, this week’s trailer is being called the “official” announcement. The game is set in a prison of sorts called the Vitromotus, which appears to consist of a foggy, desolate town paired with more traditional dungeon-esque areas built for combat. There’s also a…very foreboding vibe going on in the trailer (the narration promises that there will be </span><span>many</span><span> challenges).</span></p>

 <p><span>While I’m guessing that the creepier tone will persist throughout the game’s combat segments, the player’s goal is to rebuild the town through the classic life-sim gameplay elements: farming, fishing, and befriending townspeople. The trailer shows off how the town starts to take on more of a bright, classic farming sim atmosphere as you progress.</span></p>

 <p><span>At the same time, the combat system also looks pretty fleshed out. There are “challenging” bosses, a dynamic HUD that adapts to different encounters, and a skill tree where earned perks can be inherited between classes. It seems like customization is really key here, whether it’s through designing a homestead or improving the main character’s stats and abilities.</span></p> <p><span>As a </span><i><span>Stardew Valley</span></i><span> freak who has always wished the game had a more in-depth combat system, I’m looking forward to checking out <em>Emberville</em> (and finding out who else could possibly be part of that already wild voice cast). It’s currently slated to come to PC sometime in 2026.&nbsp;</span></p>

            <title><![CDATA[10 Tips To Know Before You Start Playing Code Vein 2]]></title>
            <link>https://kotaku.com/code-vein-2-tips-beginner-blood-codes-weapons-2000663875</link>
            <guid>1419061</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><i><span>Code Vein II</span></i><span>, the sequel to Bandai Namco’s 2019 anime Soulslike, is here. While it’s pretty easy compared to other games in the genre, the bosses can still be challenging if you’re careless or don’t level up properly. </span><i><span>Code Vein II</span></i><span> adds a new open world for you to explore, giving you more options to progress throughout the game. Here are some useful tips to surviving its post-apocalyptic vampiric world.</span></p> <h2>1. Ride your bike</h2> <p><span>In the opening hours of </span><i><span>Code Vein II</span></i><span>, you’ll obtain your bike/motorcycle that can be whipped out at almost any time when you’re out traversing the open world. It’s obviously much faster than running around, but it also has some utility. If you’re fast enough, you can ram straight through enemies, dealing a small amount of damage to them. So if you’re in an area where you just want to skip all the enemies, just hop on your bike and charge through. It also makes for a great getaway vehicle. There were some moments where I had run out of healing items and was about to die, so I pulled out the bike and simply drove away to recoup.</span></p>

 <h2>2. If you’re overwhelmed by a story boss, come back later</h2> <p><i><span>Code Vein II </span></i><span>may be an easier Soulslike, but the bosses can still wreck you if you’re not prepared. However, because of </span><i><span>Code Vein II</span></i><span>’s open-world design, if one boss is giving you a good deal of trouble, you’re free to explore other areas and tackle different bosses. Additionally, unlike in some Soulslikes that have you manually putting points into the attributes you want to strengthen, here your character gets predetermined, across-the-board stat increases as you level up. So if a boss is continually wiping the floor with you, just come back when you’re stronger, as those additional levels you’ve acquired will definitely make a difference.</span></p> <h2>3. Find health upgrades as soon as possible</h2> <p><span>There are two different health upgrades: Golden Blood Beads and Golden Nectar. The former increases the amount of health recovered when using a potion, while the latter increases how many you can carry at one time. You can find them in the open world and they’re actually indicated on the map as blue dots. Seek those out, as better recovery obviously means more survivability.</span></p>

 <h2>4. Uncover as much of the map as possible</h2> <p><span>When you first start playing </span><i><span>Code Vein II</span></i><span> your map will be obscured, a result of these small red trees that act as map jammers. They’re indicated on your map as pink circles, so you can track them down and destroy them. This’ll help you get more clarity out in the world and know where to head next.</span></p>

 <h2>5. Do the side content</h2> <p><span>Doing the side content can be extremely helpful in your progression. Not only will you get stronger by defeating additional enemies, but you’ll also find new weapons, skills, and Blood Codes to experiment with. This’ll help you flesh out your builds, giving you more ways to fight enemies. Plus, if you’re looking to get all three of the game’s endings, you’ll need to finish each of the heroes’ Timeline Decision side missions.</span></p> <figure id="attachment_2000663893" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000663893"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000663893">©Bandai Namco</figcaption></figure> <h2>6. Constantly swap out Blood Codes</h2> <p><span>Blood Codes act as sort of “character classes” in </span><i><span>Code Vein II</span></i><span>, and offer a variety of different stat bonuses and abilities tailored to specific playstyles. For example, if you like to heal, then you might gravitate toward using Holly’s Blood Code more. When you defeat enemies with a Blood Code equipped, you’ll earn EXP toward them and eventually max them out. If you take one you’ve maxed out to Lavinia in MagMell, she can extract a Booster from it, a passive skill that can further enhance your builds. So keep switching out Blood Codes to obtain even more Boosters.</span></p>

 <h2>7. Upgrade your Weapons, Bequeathed Forma, and Jail</h2> <p><span>Throughout the game, you’ll come across materials that can help strengthen your equipment, and it’s imperative that you do so. By upgrading your weapons, Forma, and Jail, you’ll increase their effectiveness, letting&nbsp;you deal more damage per hit. If you’re finding that you’re not dealing enough damage, it might be time to head back to the shopkeepers in MagMell (and across the open world) to level up your gear. The max level for your weapons and Jails is +20, while it’s +5 for you Bequeathed Forma. There are separate achievements to unlock for all three.</span></p> <h2>8. Take advantage of Item Synthesis</h2> <p><span>Materials can also be used to create helpful items outside of the typical healing potions, such as ammo for rifles and bayonets, as well as food to temporarily increase stats like defense and maximum Ichor. These items can be very helpful in a pinch during the middle of a fight, so be prepared! The game gives you eight shortcuts you can equip items to so you can use them on the fly; don’t neglect them.</span></p> <figure id="attachment_2000663895" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000663895"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000663895">©Bandai Namco</figcaption></figure> <h2>9. Keep an eye on your Ichor reserves</h2> <p><span>Ichor is </span><i><span>Code Vein II</span></i><span>’s magic point system, which can be used to execute flashy attacks called Weapon Fromae. It’s easy to get carried away and not realize that your Ichor levels are dry and you can’t use any more Formae attacks. But don’t worry! Use your Jail attack to drain enemies and replenish your Ichor. Just monitor your reserves so you don’t suddenly find yourself wondering why you can use your Formae anymore and waste precious seconds potentially getting killed.</span></p>

 <h2>10. Let your ally take the hit</h2> <p><span>One of the main reasons why </span><i><span>Code Vein II</span></i><span> is easier than many other games in the genre is its NPC companion system. You’ll have a companion at all times, unless dictated otherwise by story reasons. These allies don’t cost anything and cannot be killed. This makes them perfect distractions for enemies and bosses. If your companion can draw an opponent’s aggro, that gives you the chance to heal or team up to deliver some killer blows. Don’t take your friend for granted!</span></p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/nintendo-says-no-to-toxic-dong-on-switch-2-as-dispatch-devs-confirm-censored-content-2000663868</link>
            <guid>1419019</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/dispatch-review-adhoc-studios-all-8-episodes-finale-2000644106"><em>Dispatch</em> is out on Switch 1 and 2</a> as of January 28, but not without some compromises. The original release had the option to censor certain explicit content from the settings menu, but the version on Nintendo platforms will censor content by default with no option to remove it. That seemingly includes brief scenes that show supervillain Toxic’s full appendage.</p> <p>“Different platforms have different content criteria, and submissions are evaluated individually,” developer AdHoc said in a statement to <em>Eurogamer</em> <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dispatch-switch-switch-2-censored-adhoc-comment">prior to release</a>. “We worked with Nintendo to ensure the content within the title met the criteria to release on their platforms, but the core narrative and gameplay experience remains identical to the original release,” the statement continued.</p>

 <p><em>Dispatch</em> is a four-episode interactive game about reformed villains navigating their emotional baggage and personal hang-ups in a superhero call center. The workplace comedy by ex-Telltale developers also includes some adult moments, like the aforementioned Toxic dong as well as romantic scenes and explicit hand gestures. In fact, some fans have spent the last few months <a href="https://kotaku.com/devs-dispatch-telltale-superhero-game-cut-sex-scenes-romance-2000643646">wishing the game was much raunchier</a>.</p> <p>At one point a character’s areola is exposed as she’s fitting into her new costume. It’s a lighthearted throwaway gag poking fun at the genre’s silly wardrobes, and I’m guessing that moment isn’t in the Switch version either. <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2026/01/psa-dispatchs-visual-censorship-settings-cant-be-removed-on-switch#:~:text=AdHoc%20Studios'%20superhero%20narrative%20adventure,playing%20solely%20on%20Nintendo%20systems.">According to<em> NintendoLife</em></a>, a late-game sex scene has been nerfed altogether. The game’s profanity made it through, however, so you can still hear the characters swear if you want.</p>

 <p>It’s unclear what exactly Nintendo’s rules are for this kind of stuff. The <em>Dispatch</em> changes are especially weird because the Switch eShop is not otherwise shy about suggestive content. Anime sex game shovelware <a href="https://ntdeals.net/us-store/tag/sexual-content?platforms=switch">remains impossible to escape</a>. Maybe some games rated ESRB 17+ are just built different.</p>
