            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://kotaku.com/a-trailer-for-the-canceled-live-action-powerpuff-girls-1851768051<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>I memory-holed the fact that CW was making an adult-oriented, live-action <em>Powerpuff Girls </em>show after the series was <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://tvline.com/news/live-action-powerpuff-girls-pilot-cancelled-the-cw-1234988763/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://tvline.com/news/live-action-powerpuff-girls-pilot-cancelled-the-cw-1234988763/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">canceled before it was even released back in 2023</a></span>. I, like plenty of other millennials growing up in the ‘90s, have a lot of good memories of watching the Cartoon Network show following three superpowered sisters, and not only did I think CW’s pitch of a more “mature” version of these characters going through adult problems sounded like the basis of a YouTube parody, but I’d also wasted enough hours of my life watching CW’s DC Comics universe shows to know that this company’s version of melodramatic campy riffs on legacy characters only works half the time. Today, March 6, a trailer for the scrapped show has been published online, and <em>Powerpuff Girls</em> fans are both glad the show never saw the light of day and morbidly curious about what it could have been.</p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="197298" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="Live Forever in the Universe of 'New World: Aeternum'" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="108" data-playlist="197298,197284,197260" data-current="197298"><div><p>Live Forever in the Universe of 'New World: Aeternum'</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197298/197298_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197298/197298_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197298/197298_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197298/197298_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"></video></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>The trailer was posted by Lost Media Busters, a YouTube channel that posts videos from canceled, deleted, or otherwise not publicly available shows, movies, and video games. The one good thing I will say about it before we start dragging the three-and-a-half minute clip is that it sounds like CW got Tom Kenny (who most know as the voice of SpongeBob) to reprise his role as the narrator for the trailer. Either that or they got a really convincing soundalike. And that does it for the positive because, holy shit, this looks <em>terrible</em>.</p><p>It looks like <em>Powerpuff </em>(there’s no <em>Girls</em> in the title because they’re grown women now, of course), would have started the same way the original cartoon did, with <em>Scrubs </em>actor Donald Faison playing Professor Utonium as he accidentally created three superpowered girls who fought crime and were generally considered heroes to the city of Townsville. Their heroism led to a wave of popularity, including merch lines and even a cartoon riff on their exploits (the original show which, in a bit of meta-humor, live-action Buttercup says “completely whitewashed” the trio), and things were going well for the girls. That is, until something happens that turns the public against them. We see protests against the girls, and eventually the three of them do something that gets Townsville mayor Mojo killed, paving the way for his son Jojo to take over. (The pair’s names are clearly an homage to Mojo Jojo, a monkey with human intelligence who was one of the cartoon’s main villains.)</p><p>After this, the girls go their separate ways, and this is where the show goes from what looks like an okay YouTube parody video to a bad <em>Saturday Night Live</em> sketch about the girls crashing out in their young adult years. Blossom runs away, Buttercup becomes a firefighter, and Bubbles becomes a burnout who drinks her nights away and tries to cash in on her lost fame. Eventually, the girls regroup in Townsville and Jojo hatches an evil scheme they must band together to stop.</p><p>But, my god, this whole thing is a hard watch. The three minutes of curated footage amounts to a series of unfunny jokes, awkward and stilted action, some of the worst green-screened flying you’ve ever seen, and a signature CW needle drop of the most popular song on the radio at the time, Dua Lipa’s “Levitating.” It oozes focus-tested flavorlessness with a slight pinch of edgy toilet humor so people know this time the Powerpuff Girls are Not For Kids. If you’ve got the stomach for it, check out the full trailer below.</p><p>CW’s campy shlock can sometimes work. <em>Riverdale </em>managed to take its self-seriousness and morph it into something enjoyable over several seasons. The company’s decade of DC Comics extended universe shows produced some real garbage, but <em>Legends of Tomorrow </em>was pretty exceptional before it was unceremoniously canceled in its seventh season. But I see no such spark here. Fans of the original show are mostly celebrating that the show was canceled before it had a chance to sully the <em>Powerpuff</em> name, though some admit they probably would have hate-watched it and others think the adaptation could have had potential.</p><p>Well, I’ll leave you with the one laugh I’ve had through looking at this all day. The top YouTube comment on the trailer right now comes from @SarilingMundo, who posted a slightly altered version of the <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2KrBZrVQ7XU&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2KrBZrVQ7XU" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">original show’s episodic sign-off</a></span>: “And once again the day is saved, thanks to whoever decided to cancel this.”</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Before you dive in with a friend or loved one, though, here are four things you should know about the game.</p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="c70e9f7e4bc09609fa674b87fa40ff1b" data-recommend-id="image://c70e9f7e4bc09609fa674b87fa40ff1b" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="An image of Mio and Zoe running through a sci-fi setting with a giant exploding sun in the background." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="An image of Mio and Zoe running through a sci-fi setting with a giant exploding sun in the background." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->EA / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="c70e9f7e4bc09609fa674b87fa40ff1b" data-recommend-id="image://c70e9f7e4bc09609fa674b87fa40ff1b" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="An image of Mio and Zoe running through a sci-fi setting with a giant exploding sun in the background." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>Whether you’re playing couch-based or online co-op, you only need to purchase a single copy of <em>Split Fiction</em> for both players to enjoy the experience. If the two of you are both sat on a couch, you can obviously share a screen. However, if you’re a pair playing online, the game’s owner can use a Friend’s Pass to allow their friend to join in free of charge.</p><p>Even better, your Friend’s Pass works cross-platform! This means if you grab the game on PlayStation 5 and your friend has an Xbox Series X, you’re still golden. Same goes for PC! No matter where you like to play your games, <em>Split Fiction</em> is good to go.</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="68fb14e774071883280597cbf7426b6c" data-recommend-id="image://68fb14e774071883280597cbf7426b6c" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="An image of Mio and Zoe climbing poles outside of a winter castle." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="An image of Mio and Zoe climbing poles outside of a winter castle." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->EA / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="68fb14e774071883280597cbf7426b6c" data-recommend-id="image://68fb14e774071883280597cbf7426b6c" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="An image of Mio and Zoe climbing poles outside of a winter castle." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p><em>Split Fiction</em> isn’t an extraordinarily challenging game, but its difficulty is no doubt a notch above developer Hazelight’s previous title, <em>It Takes Two</em>. There are a lot of segments during the game that require intense focus and quick thinking to overcome, as both players help one another bypass obstacles or defeat enemies.</p><p>Luckily, <em>Split Fiction</em>’s checkpoint system is quite generous, and failure rarely puts you back more than a minute’s worth of gameplay. With this in mind, be patient if you’re playing with friends or family who don’t have your killer gaming acumen. With a bit of trial and error, you’ll get past even the most frustrating hangups!</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="584c458b74d863ddf92bdd77b0990964" data-recommend-id="image://584c458b74d863ddf92bdd77b0990964" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="An image of Mio and Zoe looking at a side story bubble in Split Fiction." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="An image of Mio and Zoe looking at a side story bubble in Split Fiction." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->EA / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="584c458b74d863ddf92bdd77b0990964" data-recommend-id="image://584c458b74d863ddf92bdd77b0990964" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="An image of Mio and Zoe looking at a side story bubble in Split Fiction." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>As you venture through the sci-fi and fantasy lands thought up by main characters Mio and Zoe, you’ll also encounter quite a few side stories that can be explored.

In addition to the game’s main path and exciting side stories, there are numerous optional things throughout its levels that you can interact with. Some of these, such as benches for your character to rest on, offer quiet moments of reflection with a good view. Elsewhere, you may come across hilarious interactions like a cauldron where you can make potions that turn you into funny creatures, just for laughs. So don’t rush! Take your time and soak in all the game has to offer.</p><hr><p><em>Split Fiction</em> is an exciting and endlessly creative outing that co-op fans shouldn’t miss.

There are plenty of funny and heartfelt moments for you and a friend to experience in this adventure. But if you’re wondering how many hours of cooperative fun there is to be had, we’ve got the answer for you. Here’s how long it takes to beat <em>Split Fiction</em>.</p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="195896" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="Spider-Man 2's New Web Wings Make It Feel Like A Proper Sequel" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="112" data-playlist="195896,196578,194088" data-current="195896"><div><p>Spider-Man 2's New Web Wings Make It Feel Like A Proper Sequel</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195896/195896_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195896/195896_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195896/195896_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195896/195896_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/21410.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><h2 id="h3886"><a id=""></a><strong>How long does it take to beat <em>Split Fiction</em>?</strong></h2><p>Seeing as <em>Split Fiction</em> is an entirely cooperative title, the time it takes you to see it through depends largely on the skill level of both players. However, the average playthrough of <em>Split Fiction</em> will take roughly <strong>12 hours</strong>. This would be simply pushing through the game’s main storyline with minimal distractions.</p><p>It’s worth noting, though, that the distractions are half the fun of <em>Split Fiction</em>! Fully completing the game and snagging every trophy or achievement will take some dedication, as you’ll need to be on the same page about finishing every side story and finding a variety of optional one-off moments throughout the game.</p><figure id="" data-id="702a4f752baa8aa3de72fbc6b1356000" data-recommend-id="image://702a4f752baa8aa3de72fbc6b1356000" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="An image showing Split Fiction's main characters in split screen shooting at mechs in a sci-fi setting." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="An image showing Split Fiction's main characters in split screen shooting at mechs in a sci-fi setting." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->EA</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="702a4f752baa8aa3de72fbc6b1356000" data-recommend-id="image://702a4f752baa8aa3de72fbc6b1356000" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="An image showing Split Fiction's main characters in split screen shooting at mechs in a sci-fi setting." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Luckily, <em>Split Fiction</em> has a very generous chapter select that allows you to revisit past segments of the game and wrap up any side content you may have missed on your first pass through a level. This makes full completion much less stressful, leaving you to enjoy your initial play at a pace that feels right for you and your gaming partner.</p><p>If you’re a completionist looking to get the absolute most out of <em>Split Fiction</em>, you can expect to spend around <strong>15 hours</strong> experiencing its sci-fi and fantasy worlds. This includes stopping to check out all of the side stories and fun little interactions, or using the aforementioned chapter select to catch up on any of these you missed your first time through the game.</p><hr><p><em>Split Fiction</em> is available now on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X, and PC. And remember: Only one person has to buy the game, as it features a Friend’s Pass that allows a second person to play for free. So you only have half the excuses for not jumping into this thrilling co-op adventure right away!</p><p>.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
