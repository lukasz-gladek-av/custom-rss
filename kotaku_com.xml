However, a deal was never struck and it seemed like the film was destined to never see the light of day. But now a new report says a deal is in the works that could lead to <em>Coyote Vs. Acme</em> be released. </p><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://deadline.com/2025/03/coyote-vs-acme-movie-deal-sale-warner-bros-ketchup-1236329381/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://deadline.com/2025/03/coyote-vs-acme-movie-deal-sale-warner-bros-ketchup-1236329381/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">On March 19, <em>Deadline </em>reported</a></span> that Warner Bros. was negotiating a deal to sell the film to small media company Ketchup Entertainment, which will reportedly acquire it for $50 million, assuming the deal is finalized and gets across the finish line.

That film was also canned by WB in August 2022 before it was saved by Ketchup who stepped in and purchased it. The movie has since earned over $5.5 million in theaters with no virtually no marketing. </p><p>Hopefully, assuming this deal is completed, <em>Coyote Vs.

Those games were <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://youtu.be/UmCLtRhifgg&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://youtu.be/UmCLtRhifgg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">2D and level based</a></span>. <em>Zombieville USA 3D </em>is, as the name implies, in 3D and is much bigger, featuring a large cartoon town overrun with deadly zombies. You start with a single pistol and survive as long as you can while racking up cash. When you die, you return to a hub, have the chance to spend your money to buy permeant upgrades, and then return to the fray. </p><p>It’s a simple formula found in plenty of other roguelike games, and <em>Zombieville USA 3D</em> doesn’t really shake any of this up in a major way. Instead, the small team behind it have focused entirely on making a really, really good version of this kind of game with slick visuals and satisfying action. A big reason the combat feels so good is because of excellent feedback via energetic animations. Everything you do, from walking and running to shooting and hacking or smashing enemies to bits looks great thanks to a slick art style and snappy animations that have a nice bounce to them.</p><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/indiegames/comments/1hybgzc/comment/m6g1zxb/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/indiegames/comments/1hybgzc/comment/m6g1zxb/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">According to the game’s lead developer on Reddit</a></span>, who has mostly worked as a VFX artist and animator, the idea is that these “juicy” and “extra” visuals will help <em>Zombieville 3D USA</em> stand out among all the other games on Steam. And, in my case at least, it worked. When I was scrolling through <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/steam-sale-deep-discounts-doom-undertale-spring-sale-pc-1851769776&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/steam-sale-deep-discounts-doom-undertale-spring-sale-pc-1851769776">Steam’s Spring Sale</a></span>, I randomly spotted this game in the “Under $10” section and its art and animation immediately made me click to see more. A few hours later I had played a ton of <em>Zombieville 3D USA</em> on both my PC and my Steam Deck.</p><p>On Steam Deck I recommend knocking the visual settings down to medium and locking the FPS to 60 to get more battery life and a very stable experience. Once I did that,<em> Zombieville 3D USA </em>played perfectly on Valve’s portable PC. On my desktop PC, though, <em>Zombieville 3D USA</em> looks even better with raytracing and high-resolution options.</p><p>Regardless of how you play it, <em>Zombieville 3D USA</em> is a fantastic little indie zombie shooter that even supports online co-op. It demonstrates that a successful game doesn’t have to be massive or completely reinvent the wheel. Sometimes, all you have to do is perfectly nail a simple gameplay loop and make sure your game looks cool as heck and you’ll end up with something special that catches people’s eyes. </p><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://store.steampowered.com/app/1801520/Zombieville_USA_3D/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1801520/Zombieville_USA_3D/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>Zombieville 3D USA</em> is currently available on Steam for $8</a></span>.

You know what I mean. These people, usually to simp for billionaires, voice their support for AI taking over creative fields, or justify discriminating against people, love to make their arguments in the most grandiose, wordy way possible, as if they were the one-winged angel himself monologuing over Aerith’s corpse. I think I’ve found the perfect counter to Sephiroth posting: Barret posting.</p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="195905" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="Three Things We Learned From The Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth Demo " data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="121" data-playlist="195905,196452,195519" data-current="195905"><div><p>Three Things We Learned From The Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth Demo </p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195905/195905_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195905/195905_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195905/195905_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195905/195905_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/21419.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><figure id="" data-id="df63d37f494cc17fb7dee5d3c8ea901a" data-recommend-id="image://df63d37f494cc17fb7dee5d3c8ea901a" data-format="png" data-width="732" data-height="490" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A Bluesky screenshot that shows Sephiroth standing over Cloud and Aerith with an Elon Musk quote in the text box that reads &quot;My companies make great products that people love and I've never physically hurt anyone.

He’s the leader of the eco-terrorist group AVALANCHE which is trying to save the world from the Shinra megacorporation that is destroying the planet. He’s also a no-nonsense activist known to give a rousing speech or two when the going gets tough. Unlike Sephiroth, he gets right to the heart of what he’s trying to say, doesn’t bloviate about why bad things are actually good, and speaks to real issues with the kinda gusto you need to change the world. If somebody speaks with clarity in favor of the common good, you can probably put it as a caption under Barret’s face and I would believe it to be a genuine screenshot from <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/final-fantasy-7-rebirth-review-ps5-1851276129&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/final-fantasy-7-rebirth-review-ps5-1851276129"><em>Final Fantasy VII Rebirth</em></a></span>.</p><figure id="" data-id="427b5f6e3181cb9dadd4e13a2ef62e45" data-recommend-id="image://427b5f6e3181cb9dadd4e13a2ef62e45" data-format="png" data-width="737" data-height="738" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A Bluesky post that shows Barret with a speech bubble above a separate post that reads &quot;“I can’t believe they are damaging Elon musks private property”  Why can’t you believe this.

Sephiroth posters, meanwhile, will come looking for you. They just spent 30 minutes coming up with a 300-character diatribe, and they’ll be damned if someone isn’t going to at least be subjected to it long enough for them to hit the block button. But Barret posters, I see you, I hear you, and I know you’re fighting the good fight against these insufferable fucks.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
