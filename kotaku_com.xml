              <p>Not a fan of big, bulky PCs taking over your workstation? You might want to consider investing in a mini PC. These options pack significant power in a compact frame and are easy to carry around on the go.</p>
<p>The market is filled with options, but if you’re after something muscular that can handle both regular work and some resource-intensive projects with ease, the mini gaming PC by Acemagician is worth a look, especially at its current price. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6688/">Amazon has now dropped the model by 30%, offering it for just $599, down from $856.</a> You’re saving a whopping $257 on a powerful option that comes with Windows 11 Pro pre-installed. Delivery is free, too, which sweetens the offer even more!</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6688/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Incredible Performance, Spacious Storage</h2>
<p>This PC runs on the efficient Intel Core i9 13900HK processor, which features 14 cores (6 P-cores + 8 E-cores) with 20 threads, and turbo boosts up to 5.4GHz. It’s built on Intel 7 process technology with 24MB Smart Cache and 54W TDP to deliver speedy, reliable performance for all your tasks, whether you’re working on an office project or trying to get creative with a personal assignment. The processor outperforms options like i9 12900HK, 7840HS, and 6800H in overall performance, too. You can rely on it for content creation, 4K editing, business workloads, studies, and even gaming.</p>
<p>There’s a massive 32GB DDR4 RAM to keep things snappy as you push through productive days. It’s more than enough to help you multitask like a pro with ease. Think juggling multiple applications at the same time, hopping through a ton of tabs on a couple of different browsers, taking back-to-back video calls, and streaming while gaming – all this without experiencing noticeable slowdowns. Storage capacity is just as impressive, thanks to a 1TB PCIe 4.0 NVMe SSD. It’s roomy enough to house all your multimedia files (photos, videos, movies), work documents, research papers, important programs, and more. Best of all, both the memory and storage are expandable up to 64GB RAM and 4TB, respectively. This means you can always upgrade the system as your needs grow, without relying on external solutions.</p>



<p>All these specs also make this mini PC great for playing your favorite games. While it won’t offer the performance of a full-fledged gaming PC, it’s more than capable of running titles like Fortnite, League of Legends, and Valorant on medium settings. Those who prefer a larger, more productive work/play setup will appreciate how it can support up to three displays at the same time. Other connectivity options include WiFi 6E, Bluetooth 5.2, and a 2.5GbE LAN port. Additionally, USB4 ports take the performance even further by offering up to 40Gbps transfer speeds. For reference, it can easily move a 3GB 4K video in just 1 second – quite literally.</p>
<p>Despite all this power, the mini PC stays fairly quiet while working. It comes with an advanced dual fan that ensures quiet and efficient operation, regardless of the task at hand. The PC itself is quite compact and can even be mounted at the back of a monitor for a cleaner setup. Windows 11 Pro comes pre-installed, too, so you can get started with using the device right away.</p>
<p>To wrap it up, if you’ve been looking to give your desktop setup a refresh, now is a great time to make the move. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6688/">This efficient PC is now available for less than $600, and is sure to make both work and play a lot more enjoyable.</a></p>

            <title><![CDATA[Pokémon’s Promo Card For Its Natural History Museum Collab Could Scare Off Scalpers]]></title>
            <link>https://kotaku.com/pokemon-natural-history-museum-pikachu-card-scalper-2000657713</link>
            <guid>1399387</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><span>After the destructive shitstorm that happened when </span><i><span>Pokémon </span></i><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-van-gogh-museum-scalpers-pikachu-card-1850882131"><span>collaborated with Amsterdam’s Van Gogh Museum</span></a><span> in 2023, I’m surprised any esteemed establishment wants to partner with Pikachu and friends. Videos of </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-scalper-reseller-trading-card-van-gogh-pikachu-1850925900"><span>scalpers pulling a Black Friday-level raid</span></a><span> on the museum’s store are still lodged in my brain, and when I heard the Natural History Museum in London was going to have a </span><i><span>Pokémon </span></i><span>exhibit later this month, I started bracing myself for a repeat. It may still happen, but now that The Pokémon Company and the museum have </span><a href="https://www.pokemon.com/uk/pokemon-news/pokemon-natural-history-presents-pokecology"><span>announced the card</span></a><span> they’ll be giving out at the event, some fans are </span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/PokemonTCG/comments/1q6bqwn/new_natural_history_museum_promo_for_the/"><span>letting out a sigh of optimistic relief</span></a><span> that scalpers might leave the whole thing alone.</span></p> <p><span>The “Pikachu at the Museum” promo card is super cute, and shows the little yellow guy excitedly walking through a museum adorned with what look like fossils of Aerodactyl and Tyrantrum. At a glance, it doesn’t look like a great card for competitive play, with reasonably low stats and good but not great damage output for the amount of energy cards you’ll have to feed into it, but none of that actually matters because this card won’t be used in a deck. It’s a jumbo card, not suitable for use in a playable deck or, perhaps more notably, for placement into a collector’s binder.</span></p>

 <figure id="attachment_2000657715" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000657715"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000657715">© The Pokémon Company</figcaption></figure> <p><span>This is significant because jumbo cards tend to go under scalpers’ radars, specifically because they’re often harder to sell. Though its rarity may still bring in vultures, fans are hopeful this choice will take the wind out of resellers’ sails. On top of this, the card will be available at select UK retailers on January 30, so if scalpers want it that badly, they might have better luck bothering a store than a museum.</span></p>

 <p><span>“I love how their scalping prevention is ‘let’s make it a jumbo, nobody cares about jumbos,’” ZVAARI wrote on Reddit. “Hope someone makes a nice normal sized reproduction of it, the art is cool and I’d like to have it in my binder.”</span></p>

 <p><span>“Its both a shame it’s oversized (won’t fit in my collection nicely), but also will hopefully prevent too much hype,” PlopTheOwl wrote in the same thread. “Love the art. Would have liked it to be a full art, but honestly so pleased to see some Pokémon bones like in-game Pokémon museums.”</span></p>

 <figure id="attachment_2000657714" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000657714"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000657714">© The Pok<span>émon Company</span></figcaption></figure> <p><span>After this announcement, I’m more concerned the collab’s exclusive merchandise might be targeted by scalpers, rather than the card itself. The museum will also be selling an exclusive collection of art, stationery, clothes, collectibles, and a Pikachu plush showing him hugging a miniature museum. These will also be sold online at the UK Pokémon Center shop and the museum’s online store. If nothing else, it seems the museum and Pokémon Company are trying to avoid a second Van Gogh debacle, but we’ll see if these safeguards actually amount to anything, as scalpers still find a way to ruin anything with Pikachu’s face on it. If nothing else, I hope the fans who show up to see the exhibit are able to have a good time without being trampled by someone looking to flip the merchandise.</span></p>

 <p><span>The </span><i><span>Pokémon </span></i><span>x Natural History Museum event will last from January 26 to April 19.</span></p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/asus-zenscreen-15-6-portable-monitor-quietly-drops-to-a-record-low-with-a-3-year-warranty-included-2000657284</link>
            <guid>1399384</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Tired of running out of screen real estate when working on your laptop? The ASUS ZenScreen 16″ (viewable 15.6″) is a mobile monitor that can give your laptop or tablet the feel of a complete desktop wherever you go. It adds extra screen space for work, school and play, without having to carry a large additional display. And best of all, it can make working with multiple windows much more comfortable at home, at the office, or on the go.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6687/">You can find the ASUS ZenScreen 16″ (viewable 15.6″) at Amazon for the low price of $119, which is a $30 savings off of the original price of $149</a>. This is an excellent opportunity to save money on this product, since it’s been discounted 20%.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6687/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>An additional portable monitor to give you more space</h2>
<p>This 15.6-inch viewable display is large enough to be used as a true secondary monitor. That means you can keep email, chat, or reference documentation open on one window while you are working on the primary window. For example, this would be ideal for students researching papers, professionals managing spreadsheets and taking phone calls, or anyone that likes to keep streaming video and/or social media feeds open while they work. The text appears clear, and the widescreen format works well for having multiple windows side-by-side.</p>
<p>The ASUS ZenScreen 16″ is also extremely portable. The monitor is very thin and lightweight, making it easy to fit into a backpack or laptop case without being too bulky. Whether you’re traveling a lot or you just want to give yourself more room to work, game, or browse online, ou can’t do much better than this.</p>



<p>Setting up the ASUS ZenScreen 16″ is also easy. Just connect it with a single USB-C cable that provides both power and video in minutes. That means you don’t actually need any additional power bricks and cables. And who wants to figure out a place to put all of those, anyway? This results in a clean workspace and allows for easy movement between locations. Mostly, that means you might actually use it instead of tossing it in the closet.</p>
<p>Tech can be prohibitively expensive in some categories these days, and it can be hard to find deals on things you want to add to your stack. An extra monitor can be expensive, but this deal makes it relatively painless to spend.</p>
<p>This portable monitor might just change the way you get things done online. It can help, first and foremost, make your digital life seem less cluttered. Whether you’re creating graphics and placing tool palettes to the sides, keeping notes open during online classes, or monitoring chat windows while gaming, the additional screen will make a difference. All you have to do is make sure to grab it while it’s discounted.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[January Kicks Off 2026 With Some Big Free Games]]></title>
            <link>https://kotaku.com/epic-store-free-games-jan-2026-amazon-prime-2000657707</link>
            <guid>1399354</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>The Epic Games Store’s holiday giveaways are over but it’s getting 2026 started with another batch of very good freebies. That’s on top of a bunch of free games Amazon is giving away for paid Prime subscribers.</p> <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/total-war-three-kingdoms-the-kotaku-review-1834993637"><em>Total War: Three</em> Kingdoms</a>, normally $60, is the Epic Games Store’s first big free game of the year, which anyone can go and claim just by logging into the PC <em>Fortnite</em> launcher. The sprawling strategy game is one of the <em>Total War</em> franchise’s best and will cover you for the rest of the month and beyond if you’ve never played it before. It also won’t break your PC in terms of specs, with only a GTX 650 equivalent needed to get the game running.</p> <p>The other freebie right now is <em>Wildgate</em>, the sci-fi PvPvE multiplayer shooter from ex-Blizzard developers. The idea of <em>Sea of Thieves</em> in space with Moba elements is neat, but the execution leaves something to be desired. The player counts have gotten low on Steam, so if you want to check out what this one’s all about before it’s potentially put on ice, now’s the time. Both<em> Wildgate</em> and <em>Three Kingdoms</em> are free through January 8.</p>

 <h2>Prime Gaming free games for January 2026</h2> <p>Amazon also revealed the games that Prime subscribers can claim for free this month, starting with <em>Civilization 6</em>. Here are the rest:</p> <blockquote> <p id="available-now"><strong>Available Now</strong></p> <ul> <li><em>Reflections of Life: Dark Architect Collector’s Edition</em></li> </ul> <p id="january-15"><strong>January</strong> <strong>15</strong></p> <ul> <li><em>Deathkeep</em></li> <li><em>Brigador: Up-Armored Deluxe</em></li> <li><em>Gunslugs: Rogue Tactics</em></li> </ul> <p id="january-22"><strong>January 22</strong></p> <ul> <li><em>Harold Halibut</em></li> <li><em>D&amp;D Stronghold: Kingdom Simulator</em></li> </ul> <p id="january-29"><strong>January 29</strong></p> <ul> <li><em>Elderborn</em></li> <li><em>Technotopia</em></li> <li><em>Al-Qadim: The Genie’s Curse</em></li> </ul> </blockquote> <p>Given<em> Civilization 7</em> still isn’t quite where fans want it to be following its launch last year, <em>Civ 6</em> is a great place to start for anyone who’s been away from the 4X series. <em>Brigador: Up-Armored Edition</em> is also an oldie but a goodie. The top-down, twin-stick shooter is like the old J<em>ungle Strike</em> games but for mechs.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/google-pixel-watch-4-gets-a-bigger-discount-than-the-apple-watch-lte-model-is-nearly-as-cheap-as-the-wi-fi-version-2000657678</link>
            <guid>1399351</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Smartwatches do a lot more than just track your steps and monitor your heart rate. The best options out there are made to help you stay connected, plus on top of your health and fitness levels, right from your wrist.</p>
<p>Google makes some of the best Android smartwatches out there. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6609/">Now is a great time to pick up its latest Pixel Watch 4, as Amazon has dropped it by 22%. This brings the price of this $450 watch down to just $350</a>. The offer applies to all color options, including the black case with obsidian band, the champagne case with lemongrass band, and the silver case with iris band, so there are options to choose from. Those looking for something basic yet classy should consider the black model. And if you want your watch to pop, the lemongrass band is sure to turn some heads!</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6609/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Plethora of Health and Fitness Features</h2>
<p>The smartwatch flaunts a stunning Actua 360 domed display that’s 10% larger and 50% brighter than the Pixel Watch 3. You will be able to comfortably use it in both a sunny day and a dimly lit room without squinting. The scratch-resistant Gorilla Glass, paired with aerospace-grade aluminum housing, makes Pixel 4 more durable than ever, meaning you won’t have to constantly stress about those accidental scratches and everyday wear that’s almost inevitable. Speaking of durability, the watch is also IP68-rated, which means it can withstand most weather conditions well. Wearing it while walking in the rain or during sweaty workouts won’t affect its functionality one bit.</p>
<p>Fitness-wise, the watch offers over 40 exercise modes to let you track a range of workouts, from early morning stretches to midday cardio and late-night runs. It features custom run plans and even offers real-time guidance with advanced form tracking to help you train better. When it comes to health, Pixel 4 monitors your heart rate, plus tracks your sleep. The latter helps you understand how well you rest at night, and you can then use those insights to improve your sleep quality.</p>



<p>When connected to your phone, the watch helps you view important notifications, take calls, reply to texts, and manage music – all from your wrist. Additionally, the Satellite SOS feature lets you update your loved ones on your whereabouts, even when you’re off the grid. Gemini comes built in, so you will have a smart AI assistant to help you with stuff throughout the day. You can use it to quickly search stuff, brainstorm ideas, get reply suggestions, create schedules, and more; without picking your phone up.</p>
<p>A single charge gets you up to 30 hours of battery life. You can extend it up to 48 hours in Battery Saver mode. That’s more than enough to go a couple of days without worrying about plugging the watch in. Even better, when you’re running low, a quick 15-minute top-up can get you an additional 15 hours of usage. This is great for when you’re in a hurry and don’t have the time to recharge the watch fully.</p>
<p>Note that while the basic health and fitness features are available for free, advanced metrics can be accessed using Fitbit Premium. This membership offers AI-run recommendations based on your goals, deeper insights, and even access to energizing workouts by Peloton instructors. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6609/">There’s plenty more to like about the Google Pixel Watch 4. You can now grab a $100 discount, which applies to all color options</a>. It won’t last long, though, so it’s best to place your orders without wasting time.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/ugreen-steam-deck-docking-station-hits-its-lowest-price-compatible-with-rog-xbox-ally-legion-go-and-more-2000657269</link>
            <guid>1399312</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>A few years back, Valve changed the way we think about portable PC gaming with the launch of the Steam Deck. While comparisons to the Nintendo Switch were inevitable, the real game-changer was the ability to play your existing Steam library on a handheld device. That innovation sparked an entirely new category of gaming hardware: PC gaming handhelds. Being able to take full PC games on the go was something gamers could only imagine a decade ago (I’m ignoring laptops for the sake of this argument), and it’s a level of flexibility that’s hard to beat.</p>
<p>Handheld gaming is what the Steam Deck does best, but sometimes a 7.4-inch display just isn’t enough. You might want to kick back on the couch and play on a massive 65-inch TV instead. The Nintendo Switch has made this concept familiar—but can the Steam Deck do the same? With the right dock, absolutely. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6686/">One superior option comes from UGREEN, and it’s currently available at a 33% discount</a>. Normally priced at $60, the dock is reduced by $20, bringing the cost down to just $40 for a limited time.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6686/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Extensive Connectivity for Gaming</h2>
<p>The UGREEN docking station lets you connect your Steam Deck to an external monitor or smart TV, supporting 4K output at up to 120Hz. That level of visual performance simply isn’t possible in handheld mode, where the Steam Deck tops out at a 1280 × 800 resolution and up to 90Hz. It’s also worth noting that this dock isn’t limited to the Steam Deck—it’s compatible with other handheld PCs like the Lenovo Legion Go and various versions of the ASUS ROG Ally.</p>
<p>The dock charges your Steam Deck via USB-C using 100W PD fast charging, ensuring your device stays powered while docked. It essentially becomes a home base for your Steam Deck, keeping it fully charged and ready to go whenever you pick it up.</p>



<p>In terms of ports, the dock includes two USB-C and two USB-A ports for wired controllers or accessories, though Bluetooth controllers work just as well. HDMI handles video output, and there’s also a built-in Ethernet port capable of speeds up to 1,000Mbps, making it suitable for stable online play or fast game downloads.</p>
<p>The thoughtful design of the UGREEN dock allows it to fold up for easy storage—ideal for travel. You can game in handheld mode on a flight, then dock the Steam Deck to a TV when you arrive at your hotel or Airbnb. The adjustable viewing angle also allows you to use the Steam Deck in a tabletop-style setup, similar to the Nintendo Switch’s Tabletop Mode, while keeping it charged.</p>
