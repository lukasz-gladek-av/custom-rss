              <p>Almost five years after <em>Final Fantasy VII Remake Intergrade</em> brought the game to PlayStation 5, that version of the game is getting a free new update that will add a new “streamlined” mode to the game for people who just want to enjoy the story. This patch will arrive on January 22, just in time for the RPG’s launch on <a href="https://kotaku.com/ff7-switch-2-remake-framerate-final-fantasy-2000622094">Switch 2 and Xbox Series X/S</a>.</p> <p>“To celebrate <em>Final Fantasy VII Remake Intergrade</em> launch day on Nintendo Switch 2 &amp; Xbox, a patch for the PS5 and PC versions will launch next Thursday,” Square Enix announced on January 15. “This introduces Streamlined Progression, including the ability to keep HP and MP topped up, and always hit for 9,999 damage!” Now every attack can be an Omnislash and you won’t even have to spend over 500 hours <a href="https://kotaku.com/final-fantasy-vii-player-hits-level-99-in-the-first-rea-1794171766">grinding at the first reactor to make it happen</a>.</p>

 <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">To celebrate Final Fantasy VII Remake Intergrade launch day on Nintendo Switch 2 &amp; Xbox, a patch for the PS5 and PC versions will launch next Thursday.</p> <p>This introduces Streamlined Progression, including the ability to keep HP and MP topped up, and always hit for 9,999 damage! <a href="https://t.co/XMuEdhreTP">pic.twitter.com/XMuEdhreTP</a></p> <p>— FINAL FANTASY VII (@finalfantasyvii) <a href="https://twitter.com/finalfantasyvii/status/2011740264772305213?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 15, 2026</a></p></blockquote>  <p>The previously teased Streamlined Progression mode is effectively a story mode for people who want to follow Cloud and his Avalanche pals in their journey through Midgar to topple Shinra without having to deal with all of the difficulty that might come from combat, and especially certain boss encounters. Instead of toggling the game to easy, players can make it so their characters are already maxed out and hitting for the most damage possible.</p>

 <p>While included at launch in the new ports, the patch will let existing players on PC and PS5 play around with the mode as well. Could it be an easy way to clear the game on hard for the Platinum trophy? Maybe! And for newcomers it’s worth noting that anyone who buys the game digitally before the end of the month will automatically get the digital version of the original <em>Final Fantasy VII</em> along with it.</p>

              <p><span>Because </span><a href="https://bsky.app/profile/veryimportant.lawyer/post/3lybxlwzjuc2h"><span>everyone on the internet is 12 years old</span></a><span>, the current American administration is posting through its fascist agenda with memes. Trump’s White House has previously used </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-responds-to-dhs-video-using-the-original-animes-theme-2000628222"><i><span>Pokemon</span></i></a><span>, </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/department-homeland-security-halo-ice-pokemon-video-dhs-2000639308"><i><span>Halo</span></i></a><span>, and even pop star </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/sabrina-carpenter-ice-video-juno-song-response-trump-2000649672"><span>Sabrina Carpenter’s music</span></a><span> to try to recruit people for ICE. Now, it’s using an AI mockup of beloved farming sim </span><i><span>Stardew Valley </span></i><span>to promote the return of whole milk to school lunches.</span></p> <p><span>On January 14, Trump signed a law that will </span><a href="https://apnews.com/article/whole-milk-school-lunches-trump-5572176286b322d844bb76d52906e2c7"><span>return whole milk to school lunches</span></a><span>, This is overturning an Obama-era restriction on higher-fat milk options. Alright, whatever. On a list of things Trump has done in his years in office, that’s hardly the worst. But now, the White House has used this as another opportunity to use a video game’s imagery.</span></p>

 <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">Whole milk is back. 🥛 <a href="https://t.co/kHf51s5qwX">pic.twitter.com/kHf51s5qwX</a></p> <p>— The White House (@WhiteHouse) <a href="https://twitter.com/WhiteHouse/status/2011864079053238516?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 15, 2026</a></p></blockquote>  <p><span>At a glance, it might not look like much. The AI-generated image has an ugly faux-pixel-art sprite of Trump looking like he got hit in the face with a frying pan, his inventory has a bunch of the things you’d expect like a MAGA hat and a cop badge, and he’s shown saying, “We’re bringing back Whole Milk and Making America Healthy Again.” But also, if you look at the gold he’s carrying in the screenshot, the number is 45464748.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><span>Trump is the 45th and 47th president of the United States, and has held onto the debunked claims that he won the presidency against Joe Biden in 2020. He has also publicly said he’s </span><a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/donald-trump/trump-third-term-white-house-methods-rcna198752"><span>open to a third term</span></a><span>, which would be in </span><a href="https://constitutioncenter.org/the-constitution/amendments/amendment-xxii"><span>violation of the 22nd amendment</span></a><span>, but Trump doesn’t seem to think the law applies to him. Steve Bannon, the ex-chief-strategist of the Trump administration, has also said that Trump </span><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/24/us/politics/president-trump-2028-steve-bannon.html"><span>will have a third term</span></a><span>, while also </span><a href="https://www.axios.com/2026/01/10/steve-bannon-2028-campaign-maga"><span>reportedly planning to run himself</span></a><span>. So these numbers seem to be a thinly veiled threat that Trump wants to be president again in 2028.</span></p>
