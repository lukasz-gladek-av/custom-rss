              <p><em>Bully Online,</em> a mod that added online multiplayer to Rockstar’s classic open-world game, is shutting down less than a month after launch. The creators haven’t explained why yet, but fans are already blaming Rockstar Games and its parent company, Take-Two Interactive, for the sudden demise of the project.</p> <p>Developed by Fat Pigeon, a collection of modders and fans, and led by <em>Bully</em> content creator Swegta, <a href="https://kotaku.com/bully-online-mod-play-free-gta-online-release-pc-rockstar-2000639618"><em>Bully Online</em> took years to develop</a> and launched on PC on December 15. The mod added new content like mini-games, multiplayer activities, custom vehicles, and competitive racing. Fans were excited to check it out, especially as the original <em>Bully</em> didn’t include online multiplayer and Rockstar seems unwilling to make a sequel or remaster anytime soon. But now, not long after it was released, the mod is shutting down.</p>

  <p>On January 14, a message was posted to the official <em>Bully Online</em> Discord server announcing that the mod will be shut down “forever”&nbsp; in 24 hours. According to the Discord announcement, <a href="https://x.com/TheNathanNS/status/2011478101419544964/photo/1">as seen in a message shared by TheNathanNS on Twitter,</a> the devs are stopping development of new content and scripts for the mod, removing the source code from the main site, and deleting any webpages connected to the mod, as well as wiping all account data connected to the project. The modders say players can hop on and enjoy <em>Bully Online</em> for the next 24 hours until the servers are completely wiped and deleted for good.</p>

 <h2>Why is <em>Bully Online</em> shutting down?</h2> <p>As for why <em>Bully Online</em> is being killed, nobody involved has provided a clear answer. On Discord, the announcement does make it clear that this wasn’t what the modders had planned, saying, “For now though, know this was not something we wanted.” The messages also promise that Swegta will be posting a video in the near future explaining more.</p>

 <p>Many fans are already blaming Rockstar and/or Take-Two Interactive, companies that <a href="https://kotaku.com/ambitious-gta-underground-mod-shutdowns-after-six-years-1847619249">have a long track record</a> of <a href="https://kotaku.com/take-two-is-removing-old-gta-mods-using-dmca-notices-1847315391">screwing with</a> and <a href="https://kotaku.com/take-two-sues-gta-reverse-engineering-project-1847613341">shutting down fan projects and mods</a>. But it should be noted that at the moment, we don’t know for sure what happened.</p>

 <p><em>Kotaku</em> has contacted both Swegta and Rockstar Games for more information, but didn’t hear back from either before publication.</p> <p><a href="https://x.com/SWEGTA/status/2011478849431687225">Swegta himself also confirmed the news on Twitter</a>, posting on Wednesday that he will make a “proper statement on the situation” on January 21. On the creator’s website, a new message was added that states: “The Bully Online project is shutting down. Thank you all for playing.”</p>

            <title><![CDATA[PS Plus Extra Packs A Big Lineup This Month Just In Time For Resident Evil 9]]></title>
            <link>https://kotaku.com/jan-2026-ps-plus-resident-evil-village-2000659885</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Sony revealed the latest games coming to PS Plus Extra in January 2026 and the headliner will be arriving just in time for anyone who still needs to catch up on Capcom’s survival horror franchise ahead of <a href="https://kotaku.com/resident-evil-requiem-9-capcom-grace-leon-2000632633"><em>Resident Evil Requiem</em></a>.<em> Resident Evil Village</em>, along with eight other games, will all be joining the PlayStation subscription library this month.</p> <p>Even if you’ve never played <em>Resident Evil Village</em>, you’ve probably encountered its fan-favorite vampire giantess <a href="https://kotaku.com/resident-evil-villages-lady-dimitrescu-was-worth-the-wa-1846848171">Lady Alcina Dimitrescu</a>. And while completing <em>Village</em> isn’t essential for anyone planning to play <em>Requiem</em> at launch on February 27, it’ll certainly be a nice option for passing the time until then. The other headliner this month is <a href="https://kotaku.com/infinite-wealth-like-a-dragon-review-kasuga-yakuza-1851190269"><em>Like a Dragon: Infinite Wealth</em></a>, the 2024 <em>Yakuza</em> game that’s a turn-based RPG and the first in the series to go outside of Japan.</p>

 <p>Here’s the full list of games for Extra and Premium tiers in January 2026:</p> <h2>PlayStation Plus Extra And Premium</h2> <ul> <li><em>Resident Evil Village</em> | PS5, PS4</li> <li><em>Like a Dragon: Infinite Wealth</em> | PS5, PS4</li> <li><em>Expeditions: A MudRunner Game</em> | PS5, PS4</li> <li><em>A Quiet Place: The Road Ahead</em> | PS5</li> <li><em>Darkest Dungeon II</em> | PS5, PS4</li> <li><em>The Exit 8</em> | PS5, PS4</li> <li><em>Art of Rally</em> | PS5, PS4</li> <li><em>A Little to the Left</em> | PS5, PS4</li> </ul> <h2><strong>PlayStation Classics (Premium Only)</strong></h2> <ul> <li> <p><em>Ridge Racer</em> | PS5, PS4</p> </li> </ul> <p>I’d like to draw quick attention to two of the smaller games above: <em>Darkest Dungeon II</em> and <em>Art of Rally</em>. Both are excellent. <em>Darkest Dungeon II</em> isn’t what some fans of the original game wanted, but it’s a neat crisis-management RPG mapped onto the roguelike structure of <em>Slay the Spire</em>. <em>Art of Rally</em> is a beautiful, minimalist, chill top down racing game. Give both a try if you haven’t already.</p>

 <p>Oh, and <em>A Little To The Left</em> is great as well, especially for couch buddies who might not normally play games. You organize stuff in unusual ways to unlock little easter eggs. It’s way cooler than it might sound.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><em><a href="https://deadline.com/2026/01/ryan-hurst-cast-kratos-prime-video-god-of-war-1236683097/">Deadline</a> </em>is&nbsp;reporting that Sony and Amazon have tapped <em>Sons of Anarchy </em>and <em>God of War: Ragnarök </em>actor Ryan Hurst to play Kratos in the <a href="https://kotaku.com/god-war-tv-amazon-ps5-release-date-trailer-1851675600">upcoming live-action <em>God of War&nbsp;</em>series</a>.</p> <p>Hurst, who played Thor in the 2022&nbsp;<em>God of War&nbsp;</em>game, will be swapping roles for the show, and will lead the series based on the storylines of the modern <em>GoW </em>games, which find Kratos interacting with (and often fighting) figures from Norse mythology. We still don’t know who will be playing his son Atreus, but it’s cool to have Hurst on as someone who is intimately familiar with the source material.</p>  <p>Along with playing Thor, Hurst’s notable credits include playing Opie in&nbsp;<em>Sons of Anarchy</em>, as well as Beta in the&nbsp;<em>Walking Dead&nbsp;</em>franchise, both in the main series and the <em>Fear the Walking Dead&nbsp;</em>spin-off show. Most recently, he has played Miles in the new Netflix western series&nbsp;<em>The Abandons</em>.</p>

 <p>If you want a quick refresher on Hurst’s acting chops, someone was kind enough to compile all his scenes as Thor in <em>Ragnarök</em>.</p>  <p>That’s the only casting news we have for now, but given that the show seems to be comfortable picking from the game’s cast, it would be interesting to see Sunny Suljic&nbsp; reprise his role as Atreus for the series, though the 20-year-old actor might be a bit too old to play the child as he appeared in the 2018 game at this point. Atreus was still a young teen by the time <em>Ragnarök&nbsp;</em>came around, however, and Suljic still looks pretty young.</p>

 <p>There were rumors that Christopher Judge, the actor who plays Kratos in the Norse <em>God of War&nbsp;</em>games, was also up for the live-action role last year, but Judge himself seemed to debunk these in <a href="https://x.com/iamchrisjudge/status/1968155387863109880">an X post</a> in September.</p> <p>The&nbsp;<em>God of War&nbsp;</em>series is coming from writer, showrunner, and executive producer <a href="https://kotaku.com/god-of-war-tv-ronald-d-moore-battlestar-galactica-1851770751">Ronald D. Moore</a>, who is best known for his work on <em>Star Trek&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Battlestar Galactica</em>.</p>
