              <p>From unexpected power outages that can leave your home in the dark to weekend camping trips where you still need to charge devices and run small appliances, these portable power stations deliver peace of mind when you need it most. Jackery’s Explorer 1000 has long been the bestseller in this category with its 1500W output but right now there’s a game-changing deal that changes everything: The <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4831/">much more powerful Jackery Explorer 2000 (2200W) just dropped to $799, down from $1,499, matching the original price of that classic Explorer 1000</a>. With $700 slashed off and hitting an all-time low, this is hands-down the smartest buy on Amazon.</p>

<h2>Favorite Power Generator</h2>
<p>Jackery Explorer 2000 boasts an <strong>impressive 2042Wh of capacity with three AC outlets that provide 2200W of continuous power</strong>. That means you’ve got the capability to power a full-size fridge for over 15 hours, your internet router and laptop during a blackout for days on end or <strong>charge your phone more than 150 times in a single recharge</strong>.</p>
<p>By virtue of having the 2200W output, you have the luxury of plugging power-hungry devices like microwaves, coffee makers or power tools with no fear of overloading. That <strong>USB-C PD 100W port</strong> comes in very convenient so you fast-charge laptops and tablets immediately without having to carry around big power strips. With this amount of capability, it’s perfect in home backup emergency applications, yet it’s also convenient in RV trips, tailgate parties or to power tools at remote construction job sites.</p>



<p>Despite only weighing 39.5 pounds, the <strong>Explorer 2000 is 41% lighter and 34% smaller</strong> compared to similar 2kWh lithium iron phosphate power stations. That weight disparity becomes enormous when you hoist it out of your garage and into your vehicle, or from vehicle to campsite. Jackery was able to do this with the application of CTB technology taken from the design of electric vehicles that mounts the battery cells internally into the structure itself.</p>
<p>Normal AC charging <strong>gets the battery from dead to 80% in a very impressive 66 minutes</strong> so you can give it a quick top up before you go. In a real hurry? Emergency Super Charging via the companion app gets it to full in 102 minutes. And for those who love solar independence, the unit will take up to 400W of solar panel (sold separately) and recharge to full in approximately six hours of good sun. There’s even a silent charging mode that operates at under 30 decibels while still giving you a full charge in five hours.</p>
<p>At this all-time-low price of only $799, you’re getting high-grade backup power that literally could save the day during the next storm or blackout.</p>
