              <p>Cady “Fandy” Hoffmann can usually be found on Twitch streaming <em>World of Warcraft</em> or <em>Overwatch 2</em>. This week, fans found her livestreaming the birth of her first kid. They’re calling Fandy the first streamer to give birth on Twitch. Many are not sure how to feel about the newest breakthrough in streaming culture.</p> <p>“Hi twitter my water just broke so I think I’m going this live Baby time&nbsp;:)” Fandy <a href="https://x.com/fandybtw/status/1975712190050279688">wrote on X</a> at 7:57 p.m. ET on October 7. The birth took place at home surrounded by friends and family with the camera on the far side of the room and privacy when mom needed it. A nurse appeared to be present as well. The Twitch chat was displayed on the living room TV with Fandy occasionally interacting in-between contractions.</p>

 <p>“I’ve waited forever for her,” she said at one point. “Get the hell out already.”</p> <p><iframe loading="lazy" src="about:blank" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" scrolling="no" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" data-rocket-lazyload="fitvidscompatible" data-lazy-src="https://player.twitch.tv/?video=2585966702&amp;parent=kotaku.com"><span data-mce-type="bookmark" style="display: inline-block; width: 0px; overflow: hidden; line-height: 0;" class="mce_SELRES_start"></span><span data-mce-type="bookmark" style="display: inline-block; width: 0px; overflow: hidden; line-height: 0;" class="mce_SELRES_start"></span></iframe></p> <p>Giving birth in real life doesn’t happen as fast as in the movies. Fandy walks around, bounces on a yoga ball, and rests at various points during the livestream marathon before eventually getting into an inflatable water birth pool. Twitch CEO Dan Clancy even appeared in the chat at one point to wish her well. “Fandy, best of luck and congratulations. Wishing you the best in this journey,” Clancy wrote. Others in the chat said to <a href="https://x.com/Alykkat/status/1975775572845613449">fill the pool with Tylenol</a> for “optimum chances of raising a human genius.”</p>

 <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">literally staying up late to watch someone livestream their birth spamming "lock in" and "push"</p> <p>you know what hell yeah</p> <p>— Liquid Eiya (@EiyaWoW) <a href="https://twitter.com/EiyaWoW/status/1975819858874110405?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 8, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <p>The stream peaked at over 30,000 viewers, <a href="https://www.dexerto.com/twitch/twitch-streamer-fandy-gives-birth-live-on-stream-as-tens-of-thousands-tune-in-3263532/">according to<em> Dexerto</em></a>, with thousands hanging around to witness the moment the baby came out over seven hours later. Fady named her Luna and both mom and kid appear to be perfectly healthy following the landmark milestone for the Amazon-owned video platform. The two are resting peacefully at the end of the stream. Even <em>TMZ</em> felt the need to <a href="https://www.tmz.com/2025/10/08/streamer-fandy-gives-birth-live-on-twitch/">blur the newborn’s face out</a>.</p>

 <p>The stream was a wholesome look inside one of the most important and intimate moments in a person’s life. Maybe some fans preparing to have a child of their own will find it reassuring to see how smoothly it went. So why does it feel like there are just some things that don’t need to be recorded, let alone shared with the whole world in real-time? How will the child feel about it later on in her life? Why am I, a complete stranger, even in a position to have questions like this?</p> <p>“That’s a plus one baby, boys!” said husband Adamax after seeing his newborn for the first time. May they all live happily ever after.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/clair-obscur-expedition-33-ending-choice-canon-correct-2000633292</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><span>One of the many consequences of modern fandom’s obsession with “canon” is that stories that have open-ended themes or choices are now held to a new standard of scrutiny. Swaths of the video games we play are about choice, whether that be in the weapons we wield or the sacrifices we make; however, because the internet has become fixated on listing events in bullet points on wikis, the act of making choices and watching the consequences unfold isn’t enough. Some players want to be “right,” and they want video games and their creators to tell them so. </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/clair-obscur-expedition-33-rpg-review-in-progress-1851777402?_gl=1*9icn1w*_ga*MTc0MjY2NTg1OS4xNzQwMzc1OTc4*_ga_V4QNJTT5L0*czE3NDcyMzIxNjAkbzU4JGcxJHQxNzQ3MjQ1MDg0JGo2MCRsMCRoMCRkTGhKQ1VESkJYd2lqTzFUMTlocEx1a0ptWERkbVBiM21jZw.."><i><span>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</span></i></a> <span>is not primarily a choice-based game, but it does offer one at the very end that changes the story entirely. Since the RPG launched back in April, fans have debated the merits of both outcomes, but because a sequel is coming and some people need validation, the developers at Sandfall Interactive have come out and said there is no “correct” ending.</span></p>  <p><i><span>Clair Obscur</span></i> <a href="https://kotaku.com/clair-obscur-expedition-33-ending-verso-maelle-choice-1851778284"><span>ends in one of two ways</span></a><span>, depending on whether or not the player chooses to play the final duel as either the paintress Maelle or Verso, the painted version of her deceased brother. In an interview with Lits Play, </span><i><span>Clair Obscur </span></i><span>lead writer Jennifer Svedberg-Yen spoke about how both endings of the game are valid and were made with purpose. Neither was meant to be the “other” or “wrong” choice.</span></p>

 <p><span>“I tell everyone there is no ‘correct’ ending, there is no ‘canon’ ending, there is no ‘official Sandfall’ ending,” Svedberg-Yen said. “Both endings are there for a reason; we put them both there for a reason; they were designed in a very particular way. Neither is perfect. Both are heartbreaking in their own ways. Both of them have parts that make you glad, parts that you feel like, ‘okay, I want a happy ending for these characters,’ but both of them also have their own cost. It’s a reflection of reality. You know, a lot of times, some people’s happiness does come with its costs. Things are very rarely perfect. And I think we were really trying to also show both sides of the story.”</span></p>

  <p><span>She’s right. Obviously, the debate over which is the morally correct answer is a whole different discussion. I personally chose the Maelle ending because it felt thematically appropriate, while also understanding that the Verso choice is probably the one that provides the most closure. Both have their merits and drawbacks, and one of the rewarding things about choice-based games is that we get to argue about those forever. However, this modern need to have these decisions declared “correct,” either by the text or by the developers, has added an often dismissive layer to those discussions.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><span>To some extent, this goes back to an attachment players have to their own “canon.” If a sequel like </span><i><span>Infamous Second Son </span></i><span>chooses one of its predecessor’s endings to build off of, it raises questions about the other choice. Why was it there if it was going to be cast aside? What does it say about players who chose the other option? Were they wrong? Was any debate about the morality or merits of that choice for nothing? This is a cloud that has been hanging over the next </span><i><span>Mass Effect </span></i><span>game for nearly a decade, as the remnants of BioWare have to figure out how they’re going to make a fifth game set in the Milky Way that either works for all of </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/mass-effect-3-ending-shepard-catalyst-crucible-choice-1851313435"><i><span>Mass Effect 3</span></i><span>’s galaxy-defining final choices</span></a><span>, or picks one and moves the timeline forward from there.</span></p>

 <p><span>BioWare is an interesting example to point to when it comes to this dilemma, because even though the </span><i><span>Mass Effect </span></i><span>and </span><i><span>Dragon Age </span></i><span>communities love to throw around terminology like “canon” to refer to specific choices that are chosen by default if players don’t import a world state or save from a previous game, the studio doesn’t view it that way at all. The team has even said it would </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/dragon-age-veilguard-canon-choice-bioware-mass-effect-5-1851646112"><span>rather not acknowledge a decision</span></a><span> in a sequel like </span><i><span>Dragon Age: The Veilguard </span></i><span>than contradict it. This allows players to feel like their world state is valid, even if they’re not staring the ramifications of it in the face every game.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><span>Maybe it’s because I </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/baldur-s-gate-3-cyberpunk-mass-effect-character-creator-1851422575"><span>grew up spending a lot of my early roleplaying days</span></a><span> working within the gaps that developers didn’t fill, but I’ve never looked for confirmation from games that I was “right” when I made a decision.&nbsp; The need for a game or developer to justify what you’ve done suggests that making choices in games is about aligning your actions with the “true vision” of the developers, rather than actually expressing your own agency within the story. I almost always treat roleplaying in games as an opportunity for self-reflection. It’s a big part of why I make myself in character creators. These are my stories, and I’ll write them how I want. I’d rather a developer not pat me on the head and tell me everything I did was “correct” or aligned with canon; that’s not what it’s about, and it shouldn’t be a factor in our decision-making process.</span></p> <p><span>Perhaps the uncertainty about “what really happened” is too much for some people. For me, that flexibility, the co-existence of multiple possibilities and my ability to shape which way things go, is the best part of when games give me that autonomy.&nbsp; But the best choice-based games are the ones we’re still debating years later, not the ones for which the developers have retroactively decided which was the “one true choice.” So shoutout to Sandfall Interactive and Svedberg-Yen for sticking beside the decision they handed players, rather than capitulating to some imagined idea of “canon.” I hope they stay true to that in </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/clair-obscur-expedition-33-sequel-sandfall-interactive-2000620688"><span>the inevitable sequel</span></a><span>.</span></p>

              <p>Building a gaming PC can be a rewarding experience. I can also be frustrating as all hell. Sometimes, it is better to just get something that’s already assembled. It saves time both on shopping side of things when you’re trying to source each part you need as well as after it arrives. No delicate assembly. No headache-inducing cable management in the case. No dropping screws off the table and having them roll under the couch. Just take it out of the box and and start downloading&nbsp;<em>Hades II</em>. Right now for Prime Big Deals Days, you can save quite a big on a pre-built gaming PC. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4653/">The Alienware Aurora gaming desktop has dropped by 17%. That’s doesn’t sound like a lot, but it’s taking the price down from $1,845 to just $1,535. You’ll save $310.</a> That extra cash can buy an Xbox Game Pass Ultimate subscription for… just shy of one year? Wow, Microsoft needs to get a grip.</p>

It can even handle livestream your gaming to Twitch or YouTube.</p>

              <p>Like the original game, <i>Silent Hill f</i> sends players to an “abandoned” school during its protagonist’s attempts to escape the horrors of the fog. And similar to the original, the halls and classrooms of the school are adorned with everything you’d expect to find in an institution of learning: posters, calendars, lockers, bookshelves, cubbies; you name it, it’s there. That includes a bit of simple sheet music that many are likely to overlook as just part of the set dressing.</p> <p>It turns out, however that this slice of music, if performed, will sound awfully familiar to fans of the original <i>Silent Hill</i>. And it’s kinda spooky once you hear it, especially if you’re willing to indulge in the perilous, though fun, art of headcanoning. (Maybe kids singing this in school was what brought the fog to Ebisugaoka?)</p>

And with the help of a viewer who played the melody on guitar, the sheet music revealed itself to be none other than the opening song to the original <i>Silent Hill</i>.</p>  <p>While I can read and write music, my sight reading skills <i>suck</i>, so I wasn’t sure what music was on the sheet when I first saw it. That said, it doesn’t surprise me to find this little nugget packed into the game. <i>Silent Hill f</i>’s environmental storytelling is really on point. And if you don’t speak Japanese, I highly recommend using a simple translation tool like Google’s auto-translate to find all sorts of interesting messages that speak to the various themes in <i>Silent Hill f</i>, be they on signs that encourage traditional subservient roles for women in society or other creepy posters in the school that suggest you’re being watched.</p> <figure id="attachment_2000633283" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000633283"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000633283">© Image: NeoBards Entertainment / Google / Claire Jackson / Kotaku</figcaption></figure>
