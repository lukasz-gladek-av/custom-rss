              <p><span>Deadpool, Marvel’s merc with a mouth who loves to spout off meta jokes and wink at the camera, is the kind of gimmick character that can come together like a spectacular, fourth-wall-breaking fireworks show or </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/deadpool-vr-is-a-game-for-deadpool-fans-and-nobody-else-2000645514"><span>be so grating and obnoxious</span></a><span> that he can push you away from a project entirely.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>In </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/marvel-rivals-review-hero-shooter-overwatch-netease-1851717975"><i><span>Marvel Rivals</span></i></a><span>, Wade Wilson can’t just hijack the whole game with his antics; he has to synergize with the established dynamics of other heroes’ tool kits and banter. As such, developer NetEase has found a ton of really smart and funny ways to slot Deadpool into the game that are additive, rather than disruptive. And yes, he drops a fair amount of fun pop culture references to media both in and out of the Marvel universe.</span></p>

 <p><span>Deadpool’s in-game abilities and behavior </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/deadpool-marvel-rivals-role-fourth-wall-break-meta-2000659834"><span>include numerous nods to his tendency to break the fourth wall</span></a><span>, with comic-book-style panels and pop-ups often appearing around him, </span><a href="https://x.com/HoshizoraTTV/status/2012008202855203157"><span>in-character ability descriptions</span></a><span> that you can swap to the straightforward, “emotionless” descriptions written by the NetEase team for clarity’s sake if you prefer, and even the ability to have conversations with announcer Galacta.</span></p>

    <p><span>His banter with </span><i><span>Marvel Rivals</span></i><span>’ other heroes is full of nods to pretty much every facet of the Marvel multimedia franchise. He makes references to the </span><a href="https://www.youtube.com/shorts/8EaW9rnSJNc"><i><span>Rivals</span></i><span> community leakers</span></a><span> and memes as well as to the MCU’s </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/avengers-doomsday-teaser-leak-thor-doom-trailer-avatar-2000654848"><span>fumbling multiverse saga</span></a><span>, and there’s also an </span><a href="https://www.youtube.com/shorts/waHFQEfGY-c"><span>“It’s Morbin’ Time!” line</span></a><span> referencing the notorious Sony</span> <span>flop </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/morbius-memes-twitch-movie-morbing-time-nintendo-switch-1848987370"><i><span>Morbius</span></i></a><span>. As </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/marvel-is-desperate-to-make-avengers-doomsday-the-biggest-event-of-2026-2000659295"><span>pretentious and self-important as Marvel has become</span></a><span> in the past 20 years as its movies have shifted pop culture, Deadpool does usually act as a reminder that someone in the writing room is paying attention to the criticism people have been levying at the franchise for years now. Even </span><i><span>Deadpool &amp; Wolverine</span></i><span> was </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/x-men-movies-best-worst-ranked-deadpool-logan-wolverine-1851595435"><span>taking shots at the MCU from the inside</span></a><span>.</span></p>

   <p><span>But it’s not all Marvel references. It’s fitting that in a video game Deadpool would borrow lines from series like </span><i><span>Pok</span></i><i><span>é</span></i><i><span>mon</span></i><span>, </span><i><span>Grand Theft Auto</span></i><span>, and </span><i><span>Super Mario</span></i><span>. There’s some stuff from other media as well, like </span><i><span>Spongebob Squarepants</span></i><span>. From the looks of it, voice actor Alejandro Saab ad-libbed several of these lines and “can’t believe” that NetEase kept them in the game. Oh, and you’ll also find some memes like “67” and “Hawk Tuah” in the mix. The “67” one is </span><a href="https://x.com/nerdyomniman/status/2011606344210792595"><span>pretty clever, at least</span></a><span>, and can’t be spammed like the one in </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/overwatch-2-soldier-76-6-7-emote-season-20-release-date-2000651668"><span>another hero shooter</span></a><span>.</span></p> <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">I CAN'T BELIEVE THEY KEPT ALL OF THIS! HAHAHAHAHA I love my job 🤣 <a href="https://t.co/IYABRuTEZq">https://t.co/IYABRuTEZq</a></p> <p>— Alejandro Saab | DEADPOOL | Marvel Rivals (@KaggyFilms) <a href="https://twitter.com/KaggyFilms/status/2011962195064525201?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 16, 2026</a></p></blockquote>   <p><span>Deadpool launches today as part of </span><i><span>Marvel Rivals</span></i><span>’ sixth season.</span></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Kathleen Kennedy, who helped produce and create films like <em>Jurassic Park, E.T., </em>and <em>Indiana Jones,</em> is <a href="https://gizmodo.com/dave-filoni-lucasfilm-kathleen-kennedy-2000706230">officially stepping down</a> from her role as Lucasfilm president after holding the position since George Lucas left following the Disney deal in 2012. And in a new interview with Kennedy, the longtime producer and filmmaker shared some updates on various<em> Star Wars</em> projects, and the one <em>Star Wars</em> project that left her with regrets.</p> <p>On January 15, after announcing her departure from Lucasfilm, <a href="https://deadline.com/2026/01/kathleen-kennedy-exit-interview-1236665253/"><em>Deadline</em> posted a lengthy interview</a> with the outgoing producer and president covering a whole lot of ground. Depressingly, Kennedy seems to be excited about AI and wants to work with the tech to make new stuff. She also told the outlet that she’s been planning this exit for a few years now and hand-picked her successors, <em>Clone Wars</em> creator Dave Filoni and veteran ILM manager Lynwen Brennan. And while she’ll still be around producing future <a href="https://kotaku.com/the-best-and-worst-parts-of-every-star-wars-movie-1850406311"><em>Star Wars</em> movies</a>, including Ryan Gosling’s <em>Starfight</em>er and the upcoming <em>Mandalorian and Grogu</em> flick, it’s clear from this interview that Kennedy was tired of Disney not wanting to take more risks on projects like <em>Andor</em>.</p>

 <h2>A new <em>Star Wars</em> trilogy and an update on the Ben Solo movie</h2> <p>Perhaps the biggest news to come out of this interview is Kennedy sharing the status of various<em> Star Wars</em> movie projects and<a href="https://deadline.com/2025/02/kathleen-kennedy-clarifies-lucasfilm-exit-star-wars-future-1236304421/"> confirming that the previously announced <em>Star Wars </em>trilogy</a> being led by screenwriter Simon Kinberg is still happening, at least for now.</p>

 <p>“<a href="https://kotaku.com/star-wars-celebration-ashoka-trailer-rey-new-jedi-order-1850313084#:~:text=Plus%20two%20more,%2C%20%5Band%5D%20Ashoka.%E2%80%9D">[James] Mangold’s is really on the back burner</a>, as is Soderbergh’s [Ben Solo film],” Kennedy told the outlet. “I think the ones by Taika and Donald [Glover] are still somewhat alive. That’s going to really be up to the new team to figure out. Dave, I know that Dave [Filoni] and Lynwen [Brennan] are very much on board with what Simon [Kinnberg]’s doing, and that would be a new trilogy. In the timeline of things, that takes you well into 2030 plus. So that’s really what’s up next.”</p>

 <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/star-wars-trilogy-skywalker-saga-episode-10-11-12-kinbe-1851692144">It was previously reported that this new <em>Star Wars</em> trilogy</a> wouldn’t be connected to the <em>Skywalker Saga</em>, but it is also possible that things have changed. Kennedy makes it clear in this interview that putting together <em>Star Wars</em> movies takes many years of dedication, and a lot of directors and filmmakers aren’t willing to commit to such an undertaking. That likely explains the large number of canceled and delayed <em>Star Wars</em> movies over the last seven years or so. As for the status of Kinberg’s first film in this new trilogy, it doesn’t sound close to filming at all.</p>

 <p>“[Kinberg is] working right now.,” said Kennedy. “He wrote something that we read in August, and it was very good, but not there. We’ve pretty much upended the story, and then spent a great deal of time on the treatment, which he finished literally about four weeks ago. And it’s a very detailed treatment, like 70 pages. And so he is expected to give us something in March.”</p>

 <p>I wouldn’t get too excited about this trilogy yet. Remember that Rian Johnson, who directed <em>The Last Jedi,</em> was tapped to direct a new trilogy of films after his 2017 <em>Star Wars</em> movie was a big hit. But according to Kennedy, the negative firestorm online scared him away, and he got distracted with <em>Knives Out</em> and its sequels. So who knows if this new trilogy will happen anytime soon or ever.</p>

 <h2>Regrets and concerns about studios being too afraid of risk</h2> <p>Elsewhere in the interview, Kennedy called the script for the <a href="https://kotaku.com/disney-killed-adam-drivers-cool-star-wars-movie-for-the-dumbest-reason-2000637628">Ben Solo movie</a>, whose existence was leaked publicly by Adam Driver last year and got fans very excited, “great.” And it could still happen, according to her. “Anything’s a possibility if somebody’s willing to take a risk.” However, that seems unlikely as the longtime Lucasfilm boss explained that, at the moment, Disney and other big studios aren’t interested in taking bold swings and big risks.</p> <p>“Right now we’re in an era where companies are so risk-averse, and I get it,” said Kennedy. “I hear all the conversations. They’ve got Wall Street to please, and I get it, but I also believe that that’s what contributes to things disappearing, ultimately. I just think you have to take those chances. Everything I just reeled off to you is taking a bit of a chance because none of those filmmakers are just walking in trying to do the same old, same old. I’m excited by that, but the studio’s nervous about that, and that’s kind of where it sits at the moment.”</p> <p>And as for whether she has any regrets from her time as president of Lucasfilm, <a href="https://kotaku.com/what-we-liked-and-didnt-like-about-solo-1826489974">Kennedy listed the 2018 <em>Solo</em> spin-off movie</a> as the only one because, according to her, they tried to replace Harrison Ford, and that was always going to be a nearly impossible challenge.</p> <p>“We were so excited about that idea,” said Kennedy. “And then when you’re into something, and you realize fundamentally, conceptually, you cannot replace Han Solo, at least right now. As wonderful as Alden Ehrenreich was, and he really was good, and is a wonderful actor, we put him in an impossible situation. And once you’re in it and once you’re committed, you’ve got to carry on. I think I have a bit of regret about that, but not about the moviemaking and filmmaking. I don’t have regrets about that. I just think that conceptually, we did it too soon.”</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><span>Julian Gerighty, executive producer on </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/games/tom-clancy-s-the-division"><i><span>Tom Clancy’s The Division</span></i></a><span>, has parted ways with Ubisoft after almost 27 years with the company—and only three months after the French conglomerate denied rumors about the executive’s exit.</span></p> <p><span>The departure was announced by Ubisoft studio Massive Entertainment earlier today. In the announcement, the company wishes Gerighty good luck on his new “adventure” at Battlefield Studios. Moreover, Massive tells fans not to worry, as “our teams who built this world with Julian are still here,” focused on </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/games/tom-clancys-the-division-2"><i><span>The Division 2</span></i></a><span>, extraction game mode </span><i><span>The Division 2: Survivors,</span></i><span> mobile title</span><i><span> The Division Resurgence</span></i><span>, and </span><i><span>The Division 3</span></i><span>.</span></p>

 <p><a href="https://x.com/UbiMassive/status/2012157010784186856"><span>https://x.com/UbiMassive/status/2012157010784186856</span></a></p> <p><span>Rumors about Gerighty leaving Ubisoft began back in mid-October of last year after </span><a href="https://www.resetera.com/threads/veteran-creative-lead-julian-gerighty-has-left-ubisoft-after-almost-27-years.1328146/"><span>people took notice of</span></a><span> his LinkedIn profile no longer showing his executive producer role as Gerighty’s current job. The next day, Massive </span><a href="https://x.com/UbiMassive/status/1979546362405351487"><span>issued a statement</span></a><span> via social media acknowledging the rumors, and saying they were “far from true.”</span></p>

 <p><span>“Julian is still with us as Executive Producer for </span><i><span>The Division</span></i><span> franchise, leading the creative vision for </span><i><span>TCTD2</span></i><span>, </span><i><span>Resurgence</span></i><span>, </span><i><span>Survivors</span></i><span>, and </span><i><span>TCTD3</span></i><span>.&nbsp; We can’t wait to share what’s ahead,” read Massive’s post.</span></p> <p><span>As of now, it’s unclear who will be succeeding Gerighty in his previous role. According to an </span><a href="https://www.ubisoft.com/en-us/game/the-division/the-division-2/news-updates/enWR3N37m6wAbtZbV4nuA/the-division-2-survivors-and-the-division-resurgence"><span>update about the upcoming projects</span></a><span> issued in August, Magnus Jansén was appointed as creative director for </span><i><span>The Division 2: Survivors</span></i><span>, but the update didn’t provide leadership details about </span><i><span>Resurgence</span></i><span>. Regarding the upcoming mainline entry, during last week’s </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/steam-machine-price-leak-division-3-fable-ps5-2000658489"><span>New Game+ Showcase</span></a><span>, Gerighty said </span><i><span>The Division 3</span></i><span> is “shaping up to be a monster.”&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><span>Gerighty’s departure is happening mere days after the announcement of a Realism Mode for </span><i><span>The Division 2,</span></i><span> slated to launch in March of this year, as well as a </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/ubisoft-layoffs-division-3-massive-tencent-2000659368"><span>round of layoffs</span></a><span> at both Massive and Ubisoft Stockholm, which is expected to impact 55 employees. Moreover, </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/division-3-definitive-edition-remaster-destiny-2000658970"><span>marketing for “</span><i><span>The Division: Definitive Edition</span></i><span>” recently appeared in Japan</span></a><span>, suggesting the loot shooter could be getting a remaster or a package including both games.</span></p>
