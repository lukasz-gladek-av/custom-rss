              <p><i>Silent Hill</i> is ascendant once more. Following Bloober Team’s well-received remake of <i>Silent Hill 2</i> last year, the studio has confirmed that a remake of the series’ 1999 debut, <i>Silent Hill</i>, has entered full production.</p> <p><b>Read More:</b> <a href="https://kotaku.com/silent-hill-f-review-horror-konami-hinako-ryukishi07-2000627505"><i>Silent HIll f</i>: The <i>Kotaku</i> Review</a></p> <p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/bloober-confirms-silent-hill-1-remake-in-production-and-wont-rule-out-a-cronos-sequel-just-yet">As noted by <i>Eurogamer</i></a>, Bloober Team shared the news <a href="https://www.stockwatch.pl/czat-inwestorow-gieldowych/piotr-babieno-prezes-karolina-nowak-wiceprezes-bloober-team-start-30-wrzesnia-o-godz-1100,797">during an investor call yesterday</a>. “We have two first-party production teams,” Bloober Team shared (via Google Translate), “one of which is working on the <i>Silent Hill 1 </i>project and the other has started work on the next project.” The studio also discussed its recently released horror title <i>Cronos: The New Dawn</i> which, much like the <i>Silent Hill 2</i> remake before it, has been received well.</p> <p>We’ve known about the <i>Silent Hill</i> remake since June of this year, when <a href="https://x.com/Konami/status/1933159748137828365?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1933159748137828365%7Ctwgr%5Ef2a809ce836d796e0adb1769885c38dae3a3a4fd%7Ctwcon%5Es1_c10&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.eurogamer.net%2Fthe-silent-hill-remake-has-been-revealed-during-konami-press-start-showcase">Konami teased the project</a> with the briefest of teasers featuring little more than some eerie, familiar music and the acknowledgement that the game was in development.</p> <p>While many fans of the classic survival horror series were skeptical about whether or not Bloober Team could deliver a quality <i>Silent Hill</i> experience, the team has proved the doubters wrong. And on top of that, the recently released <i>Silent HIll f</i>, developed by NeoBards, and the remake of <i>Metal Gear Solid 3</i> show that Konami is doing what it needs to do to facilitate quality video games these days.</p> <p>A remake of the original <i>Silent Hill </i>brings with it many opportunities. Originally released in the late ‘90s, the game is certainly a product of its time with its awkward camera and…<a href="https://youtu.be/diknIjVTKxo">interesting localization</a>. Not to mention, it’s kinda tricky to get your hands on it. You either need an actual PSX copy and a machine that’ll run it, or you have to snag it on the otherworldly, hellish lagscape that is the PSN store on the PlayStation 3. Terrifying.</p>

              <p>You can turn any TV into a smart TV with an Amazon Fire TV Stick.. That was the big selling point of these streaming sticks when they first came out. Though nowadays, you be hard-pressed to find a TV that isn’t already smart. That doesn’t mean though that these streaming sticks don’t have their place. Some Smart TVs honestly would be better off without any of their functionality due to an annoying user interface <em>*cough cough LG cough cough*</em>.&nbsp; This is just one person’s opinion, but I much prefer the Fire TV OS to any Smart TV on the market, plus you get Alexa support.<a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4050/"> Normally the Fire TV Stick 4K sells for $50, though right now Amazon has cut the price down ahead of Prime Big Deals Day to just $25. That’s a 50% discount.</a></p>
<p>This is the latest model of the 4K-supported Amazon Fire TV Stick. With it, you can enjoy 4K streaming&nbsp; with improved performance that’s been optimized for 4K TVs. Added Wi-Fi 6 support means you can enjoy smooth streaming over fast internet, even with a number of other devices connected to the same network.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4050/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<p>This Fire TV Stick, in addition to 4K, supports Dolby Vision, HDR10+, as well as the immersive sound provided with Dolby Atmos. You can get as close as you can to the cinema experience from the comfort of your living room.</p>
<p>A streaming media player will grant your access to close to two million movies and TV episodes across all of your favorite apps like Netflix, Prime Video, Disney Plus, HBO Max (if that’s what they’re still calling it this week), and more — provided you have an associated subscription. You can enjoy a number of free movies and shows on your Fire TV Stick 4K with channels like Tubi and Pluto TV.</p>



<h2>Alexa-enabled Search</h2>
<p>Search smarter with Alexa. One of the most annoying parts of looking up movies or shows on your TV is having to use that on-screen keyboard. It’s tedious and takes forever to move the cursor over one letter at a time to type out what you’re looking for. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4050/">Well, with the Fire TV Stick 4K, the remote has a built-in microphone and Alexa button.</a> Just hold down the button and speak into it “<em>Barb and Star Go to Vista Del Mar</em>” and before you know it, you’ll be watching Kristen Wiig and Annie Mumolo getting into all sorts of alcohol-induced hijinks.</p>
