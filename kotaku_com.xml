              <p>Classic sci-fi immersive sim <em>Deus Ex</em> is returning with a fresh coat of paint and updated features, compliments of Aspyr. The remaster about a futuristic society crumbling beneath the weight of feckless governments and wild conspiracy theories arrives at a hell of a time.</p> <p>“Question Everything. Trust No One,” reads the tagline to a game with many fans, including billionaire Elon Musk. <a href="https://x.com/elonmusk/status/1321245225755512832">He called the original “one of the best games ever” in 2020</a>. This new remaster promises visual upgrades and quality-of-life improvements similar to Aspyr’s existing HD remasters of the <em>Tomb Raider</em> games. Hopefully,&nbsp; <em>Deus Ex Remastered</em> will be the definitive way to replay one of the most important games of the century. At least it will make the PC version accessible on console. The PS2 version, <em>Deus Ex: The Conspiracy</em>, joined PS Plus earlier this year.</p>  <p>The irony of Elon Musk’s love for the game has haunted it in recent years. One of the game’s original writers, Austin Grossman, called it the immersive sim’s “worst legacy” <a href="https://kotaku.com/elon-musk-favorite-game-deus-ex-conspiracy-2000624003">in an interview earlier this month</a>.</p>

 <p>“That kind of political weight and social satire is a real common thread between&nbsp;<em>Deus Ex</em>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<em>Dishonored</em>,” Grossman, who co-wrote the Warren Spector-directed hit with Sheldon Pacotti and Chris Todd, <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/fps/deus-exs-influence-on-elon-musk-may-be-its-longest-worst-legacy-says-its-writer/">recently told&nbsp;<em>PC Gamer</em></a>. “It is the thing that Elon Musk likes, creepily. It is creepily in Elon Musk’s worldview. So that may be its longest, worst legacy.”</p> <p>Musk has been a lifelong gamer with a notorious career as an amateur Quake player back in college. Last year, however, <a href="https://kotaku.com/elon-musk-poe2-diablo-4-paid-boosting-fake-controversy-1851743670">he was caught cheating at games like <em>Diablo 4</em> and <em>Path of Exiles 2</em></a> by allegedly paying other people to boost his accounts. Trust no one, indeed.</p>
