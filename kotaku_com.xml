              <p>The computer role-playing game, most widely known as the RPG, turns 50 today! Well, as close as we can pin it, anyway. Happy birthday, RPGs!</p> <p>In 1974, the year <em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons</em> began publication, a couple of guys at Southern Illinois University called Gary Whisenhunt and Ray Wood became interested in programming in the TUTOR language for the educational computer system PLATO (Programmed Logic for Automatic Teaching Operations). PLATO was kind of extraordinary: a network of around a dozen mainframe computers running processes for several thousand terminals around the world. And like all educational devices, the University of Illinois’ PLATO was frequently misused by students, in this case to create a role-playing game on that proto-internet. That game was to be <em>The Game of Dungeons</em>, more commonly known—because of its filename—as <em>dnd.</em></p> <p>In 1975, a University of Illinois resident called Rusty Rutherford—aware of the as-yet unfinished <em>dnd</em> but not involved—spent a handful of weeks creating his own RPG for PLATO. His was called <em>The Dungeon</em>, but again due to filenames became known as <em>pedit5</em>. Due to the speed with which Rutherford worked, <em>pedit5</em> would release first, and as such take the mantle of the first-ever RPG.</p>

 <p>Meanwhile, at the Claremont University Center in California, student Don Daglow (the person responsible for the first-ever baseball game in 1971, <em>Baseball</em>, and the first-ever RTS game in 1981, <em>Utopia</em>) worked on a game for the DEC mainframe computer, the PDP-10, also based on 1974’s breakout pen-and-paper hit <em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons</em>. It was called—wait for it—<em>Dungeon</em>. According to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dungeon_(video_game)">Wikipedia</a>, it’s unknown whether the game released in 1975 or 1976, but given Daglow’s propensity for being first to genres, the former seems more likely. (He also made the first MMO in 1991, <em>Neverwinter Nights</em>.)</p>

 <p>Oh, and on November 4, 1975, another PLATO-based RPG—this time multiplayer—was released by John D. Daleske and Gary Fritz among others, with the groundbreaking title of…<em>Dungeon</em>.</p> <p>So whether&nbsp;<em>The Game of Dungeons</em>,&nbsp;<em>The Dungeon</em>,&nbsp;<em>Dungeon,</em> or&nbsp;<em>Dungeon</em> was first, what we know for sure is that they appeared in 1975, 50 years ago, and one of them on this exact day. Which is plenty of reason to mark today as the day to celebrate the birth of the genre.</p>

 <figure id="attachment_2000641119" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000641119"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000641119">© John D. Daleske et al</figcaption></figure> <p>It seems to be generally accepted that Rutherford’s&nbsp;<em>pedit5</em> was the very first of them all, a game about wandering through a single floor of a dungeon while doing the two most important RPG things: killing monsters and collecting treasure. There were spells to cast, with randomly generated enemies and loot, and a battle and leveling system based on the rules of the brand new <em>D&amp;D</em>. It was all there, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110707162725/http://armchairarcade.com/neo/node/1948">albeit limited to around 50 rooms and only 20 stored characters across the whole network</a>, due to the hefty limitations of the system. That name, <em>pedit5</em>, <a href="https://insight.ieeeusa.org/articles/going-rogue-a-brief-history-of-the-computerized-dungeon-crawl/">came from the area in which the code was stored</a>, sectioned off for Rutherford’s department of the Population and Energy Group. The group had five slots, the first three used for relevant programming, while the fifth stored&nbsp;<em>The Dungeon</em> and the fourth contained its manual. As a result, the university naturally deleted this frippery to make room for “proper” programs, but Rutherford persistently re-added it.</p>

  <p><em>dnd</em>, meanwhile, was a story as old as time: a game with large ambitions that was thus delayed and scaled back before eventually being “released.” The intention had been for the game to be a graphical multi-user dungeon (MUD), but this was never achieved, and the game eventually emerged as a more complex version of&nbsp;<em>pedit5</em>. From my reading, there appears to be a fair amount of confusion over whether developers Whisenhunt and Wood created their game contemporaneously with&nbsp;<em>pedit5</em>, or whether it eventually became an embellished version of the earlier game. Either way,&nbsp;<em>dnd</em> offered a multi-layer dungeon called Whisenwood, in which players sought a mystical Grail and Orb. Once again, it merrily ripped off <em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons</em>‘ core rules, leveling and spells, although didn’t feature <em>pedit5</em>‘s randomization. But it also boasts two extremely important firsts of its very own.</p>

 <p>The first first for&nbsp;<em>dnd</em> is nonlinearity: Players were able to return to previously explored levels, approaching the game in their own preferred order, relying on the fixed position of enemies and items to let the computer network to store all that data. The second first, and perhaps the more significant, is that this was the first game to feature a boss encounter. Heck, this post could easily have been titled “Happy 50th Birthday, Boss Fights.” Each dungeon’s exit was guarded by a high-level monster, including the Golden Dragon that protected the Orb.</p>

 <p>Then, come November 4, we get the release of the PLATO network’s&nbsp;<em>Dungeon</em> which,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mobygames.com/game/101218/dungeon/">according to <em>Mobygames</em>,</a> is considered one of the first-ever MUD games. However, there’s a weirdly small amount of information out there about this one other than that, none of which supports its being multiplayer. The <a href="https://crpgadventures.blogspot.com/2014/08/dungeon-1975.html">wonderful obsessives over at&nbsp;<em>CRPG Adventures</em></a> have been similarly stumped, unable to get it running at all.&nbsp;<a href="https://crpgaddict.blogspot.com/2021/06/brief-everything-we-know-about-1970s.html"><em>CRPG Addict</em> also had no joy</a>, finding the game missing from many retrospectives, but noting that it was <a href="https://www.daleske.com/plato/plato-games.php">marked by co-creator Daleske</a> as “incomplete,” and also as a “predecessor to <em>Moria.”&nbsp;</em>That would appear to be 1975’s PLATO <a href="https://www.mobygames.com/game/100905/moria/"><em>Moria</em></a> by Kevet Duncombe and Jim Battin, yet another RPG from that year, but this one able to have ten players joining in together. It was played in the most basic form of first-person you can imagine, but that’s enough for it to claim the title of first 3D RPG! All in that same year!</p>  <p>Obviously none of these games were technically “released,” instead being stored on university servers and spread by word-of-mouth among students and staff. This had been the case since the early 1970s, with text-based adventures already proving popular on the same systems. Others took over development of some of the games mentioned above, elaborating on them through the late ’70s as the technology improved, but it wouldn’t be until 1980 and the arrival of <em>Rogue</em> as a commercial product that anything like an RPG could be considered as becoming mainstream as opposed to mainframe.</p> <p>But it remains undeniable that 2025 marks the 50th anniversary of the RPG as a computer game, and with&nbsp;<em>Dungeon</em> (PLATO)’s November 4 release, today as good as any date on which to recognize it.</p> <p>Happy birthday, RPGs! 50 years old and still one of the most popular types of games on the planet. From <i>dnd </i>to&nbsp;<em>Baldur’s Gate 3</em>, the impact of the <em>D&amp;D</em>-inspired genre on video games cannot be overstated.</p>

              <p>Those familiar with Nintendo are likely aware of the company’s litigious proclivities (that is, except when <a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-responds-to-dhs-video-using-the-original-animes-theme-2000628222">a certain governmental body is using its intellectual property</a> to promote the brutalization of human beings). And <a href="https://kotaku.com/nintendo-pokemon-palworld-lawsuit-patent-summon-digimon-2000624724">scoring a patent for summoning monsters</a> and having them fight on your behalf, known as the “397 patent,” was an essential victory in Nintendo’s battle against “<i>Pokémon</i> with guns” survival game <i>Palworld</i>. <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/5-game-mechanics-legally-protected-by-the-companies-that-made-them/">Patenting a game mechanic</a> <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/5-game-mechanics-legally-protected-by-the-companies-that-made-them/">is nothing new</a>, but this particular patent has been <a href="https://kotaku.com/nintendo-pokemon-palworld-patent-pocketpair-court-2000640115">regarded by many as, well, <i>absurd</i></a>, and acquiring it hasn’t exactly been the victory the Pokémon Company seems to have been hoping for in its quest to deal <i>Palworld</i> an irreversible loss.</p> <p><b>Read More: </b><a href="https://kotaku.com/nintendo-pokemon-palworld-patent-pocketpair-court-2000640115">Nintendo Was Just Dealt A Big Blow In Its Battle Against <i>Palworld</i></a></p> <p>Joining the chorus of folks saying “this is silly” is Trump nominee John A. Squires, director of the United States Patent and Trademark Office (<a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/us-patent-office-boss-orders-reexamination-of-nintendos-controversial-summon-character-and-let-it-fight-pokmon-patent-which-ip-lawyer-claims-further-undermines-credibility-of-its-case-against-palworld">h/t <i>IGN</i></a>). Squires has highlighted two older patent applications from Konami and Nintendo as “prior art” that might invalidate Nintendo’s claim to owning the concept this particular patent focuses on. As a result, Squires has ordered the merits of the controversial 397 Patent to be reconsidered.</p>

 <p>It doesn’t look good for Nintendo’s aggressive efforts.</p> <p>Some, such as <a href="https://gamesfray.com/huge-blow-for-nintendo-head-of-u-s-patent-office-takes-rare-step-to-order-reexamination-of-summon-subcharacter-and-let-it-fight-in-1-of-2-modes-patent/"><i>Games Fray</i>’s Florian Mueller</a>, are describing this move by Squires as a major loss for the company. As Mueller notes, Squires has not ordered the patent to be yanked. Reexamination orders, according to Mueller, “can result in a patent being upheld.” But this specific <i>Pokemon</i> case seems unlikely to be one of those situations. Nintendo has two months to respond to the reexamination, and in that time other companies are free to challenge the merits of the patent.</p> <p>These days it feels hopeless to expect any sort of fairness or equitable decision-making to come out of the federal government, but it seems like, at the very least, Nintendo’s power grab might be reined in.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Good morning and welcome back to Morning Checkpoint, <em>Kotaku’s</em> daily round-up of interesting news and other stuff you might care about. Don’t worry, I’m not mad that you didn’t call at all while you were away. I’m used to it, really. Anyway, let’s move on and talk about <em>Concord</em>, a new<em> Vampire Survivors</em> spin-off game, bad news for <em>PUBG</em> fans on PS5, and good news for <em>Battlefield 6</em> players craving a big new map to play on.</p> <p><strong><em>Battlefield 6</em> finally has a big Conquest, but EA didn’t make it</strong></p> <p>Since <em>Battlefield 6′</em>s beta earlier this year, <a href="https://kotaku.com/battlefield-6-data-confirms-smallest-maps-franchise-ea-fps-bf1-2000640803">players have been begging the devs to make bigger maps</a>. And a few fans have grown tired of waiting and have used <em>Battlefield 6</em>‘s own in-game content creation tools to turn the shooter’s recently added (and very big) battle royale map into a few different massive conquest levels. You can see some gameplay of this below via Jackfrags.</p>

  <p>Watching gameplay of the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Battlefield/comments/1on9ras/two_new_br_maps_with_three_conquest_gamemodes/">Golf Course conquest map created by Kurtinthegrind</a> and a few other players has me both excited for the future of Portal<!--StartFragment --><span>—</span><!--EndFragment --><em>BF6</em>‘s mode dedicated to user-created levels and modes<!--StartFragment --><span>—</span><!--EndFragment -->and sad that we don’t have a big map like this in the official game yet. Portal, while fun, has various restrictions, including smaller XP rewards and less populated matches and servers. And from what I can tell, this big new conquest map made by fans runs well on console and PC. So the engine seems capable of handling this kind of experience.</p>

 <p>Honestly, if I were running Battlefield Studios, I’d be porting at least the Golf Course map into the main game ASAP as a bonus extra new level for this season. Don’t even tease it. Just drop it and watch fans go wild.</p> <p><strong><em>Concord</em> directly mentioned during UK government debate over consumer laws</strong></p> <p>Remember <em>Concord</em>? It was that short-lived hero-based FPS from Sony that <a href="https://kotaku.com/concord-shutting-down-closing-servers-refunds-ps5-1851638566">shut down just two weeks after launch</a>. Well, <em>Concord</em> was brought up in the UK House of Commons during a debate about consumer rights and laws regarding live-service video games, an issue raised by the Stop Killing Games movement. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/concords-sudden-shutdown-is-such-a-big-deal-its-been-brought-up-during-uk-government-debates-on-video-game-consumer-laws">According to <em>Eurogamer</em></a>, MP Ben Goldsborough led the debate on Monday.</p>

 <p>During the debate, another MP specifically named <em>Concord</em>, stating: “A recent example is <em>Concord</em>, a game released for PlayStation 5 and Windows in August 2024. Following a disappointing launch, Sony Interactive Entertainment made a commercial decision to shut it down. To their credit, they did refund all purchases, but this isn’t always the case.”</p>

 <p>Don’t expect any change to UK laws to come from this, as the government <a href="https://commonslibrary.parliament.uk/research-briefings/cdp-2025-0195/">has already stated it has no plans to change consumer laws</a> in regards to live-service, online-only video games.</p> <p><strong><em>Vampire Survivors</em> and <em>Warhammer</em> collide in new official spin-off</strong></p>  <p>As announced on November 4, the folks behind<em> Vampire Survivors </em>are teaming up with the <em>Boltgun </em>devs to create a new spin-off game officially known as <em>Warhammer Survivors.</em> In a press release for the newly revealed game, <a href="https://www.warhammer-community.com/en-gb/articles/dmvj6ri9/tear-through-hordes-of-tyranids-and-skaven-in-upcoming-video-game-warhammer-survivors/">Games Workshop describes it</a>&nbsp;as a “brand new and completely standalone survivors-style game” that is set in the <em>Warhammer 40,000</em> and&nbsp;<em>Warhammer Age of Sigmar</em> universes. <em>Warhammer Survivors</em> launches sometime in 2026.</p> <p><strong>You’ll have to re-earn all your <em>PUBG</em> trophies on PS5</strong></p> <p>The Xbox One and PlayStation 4 ports of <em>PUBG: Battlegrounds</em> will soon be dead and done, <a href="https://kotaku.com/well-bad-news-for-pubg-players-on-ps4-and-xbox-one-2000617500">as previously announced in August</a>. The devs are going to focus on the PS5 and Xbox Series X/S ports of the battle royale game instead. But a new wrinkle for PS4 players is that when you leap to PS5, you’ll have to re-earn all your trophies again. This was confirmed in a new blog post from the devs who say they “explored various options with Sony Interactive Entertainment to make trophy transfer possible,” but due to how much data was involved, it would be “technically difficult to implement.” So they aren’t going to do it. “We kindly ask for your understanding,” <a href="https://pubg.com/en/news/9355">said the <em>PUBG</em> team.</a></p> <h2>ICYMI:</h2> <ul> <li><a href="https://kotaku.com/new-fan-made-courage-the-cowardly-dog-game-perfect-creepy-dreams-ps4-2000640924">New<em> Courage the Cowardly Dog</em> fan game looks good</a></li> <li><a href="https://kotaku.com/pillars-eternity-3-turn-based-mode-update-avowed-crpg-2000640875">RPG <em>Pillars of Eternit</em>y is getting a turn-based option a decade later</a></li> <li><a href="https://kotaku.com/arc-raiders-loot-hack-cheat-embark-studios-2000640831"><em>Arc Raiders</em> devs returning loot to people killed by cheaters</a></li> </ul> <h2>Watch This:</h2>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/paddington-musical-animatronic-puppet-actor-london-nyc-2000641107</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><span>Few characters in pop culture exemplify goodness like Paddington Bear. The Peruvian bear has captured the hearts of children and adults alike in his books, television series, and, most recently, his beloved live-action films starring Ben Whishaw. Now, the British icon has returned to the theater for the first time in 40 years with </span><i><span>Paddington: The Musical</span></i><span>, and I’m so obsessed with how the show brings the anthropomorphic bear onto the stage.&nbsp;</span></p>   <p><span>The London production began this weekend, with its first show debuting in the West End on November 1. You can recreate the sets, cast brilliant actors as the human characters, and have excellent songs to bring it all together, but the entire show would have fallen apart if they couldn’t bring Paddington himself convincingly to life on stage. Instead of merely using a puppet, </span><i><span>Paddington: The Musical </span></i><span>utilizes a combination of animatronics, an on-stage actor, and an off-stage voice to bring the character to the show, and the results are so impressive that it’s almost uncanny.</span></p>

   <p><span>The actor you’ll see in costume on stage is Arti Shah, a little person who dons the full-body Paddington suit. While she’s interacting with the other actors, James Hameed stands off-stage and recites Paddington’s spoken lines. The costume is also fitted with animatronics so the little guy can move his mouth, blink, and be expressive on stage, which Hameed controls to match his line delivery. It’s a multi-person job, but it’s hard to argue with the results. Fans who have seen the show live are smitten with Paddington, and those of us unlucky enough not to be in London are desperate for the show to come stateside. I’ve only seen a handful of Broadway shows since moving to NYC, but I will be there for </span><i><span>Paddington: The Musical </span></i><span>if it comes over.</span></p>   <p><span>For now, </span><i><span>Paddington: The Musical </span></i><span>is only in London, so if you’re looking for a dose of marmalade-flavored feel-good joy and don’t live there, you can still boot up the excellent live-action movies on your movie streaming service of choice.</span></p>
