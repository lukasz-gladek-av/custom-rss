            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Thanks to its <a href="https://kotaku.com/final-fantasy-tactics-jobs-ranking-best-ivalice-chronicles-2000630679">excellent job system</a>, there are hundreds of abilities your characters can learn in <a href="https://kotaku.com/final-fantasy-tactics-remaster-review-ivalice-chronicles-2000628040"><em>Final Fantasy Tactics</em>:<em> The Ivalice Chronicles</em></a>. Some of them are trash. Some of them are fun but mid. Here are the godlike ones.</p> <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/final-fantasy-tactics-tips-guide-ivalice-remaster-jobs-2000630228">Abilities in<em> Final Fantasy Tactics</em></a> come in four types: action, reaction, support, and movement. Below I’ve listed the best abilities to unlock in the latter three categories. These are useful no matter what Job or action abilities you’re rocking.</p> <p>If you want my advice for action abilities, you should prioritize the Monk’s Chakra and Revive, White Mage’s Raise and Holy, Black Mage’s Flare, and the Summoner’s Cyclops and Lich. Also every Item, Geomancy, and <span id="Iaido">Iaido</span> action ability.</p>

 <p>But when it comes to the movement, support, and reaction abilities, these are the best:</p> <h2>Teleport</h2> <p><strong>Job:</strong> Time Mage</p> <p><strong>Cost:</strong> 3,000 JP</p> <p><strong>Why it’s great:</strong> You can move anywhere on the map, but with a decreasing chance of success the farther away from your current location the spot is. It breaks some maps entirely by letting you cross chasms or hop on the other side of barriers. It’s also perfect for Mages who want to cast a spell and then teleport out of range.</p>

 <h2>Ignore Elevation</h2> <p><strong>Job:</strong> Dragoon</p> <p><strong>Cost:</strong> 700 JP</p> <p><strong>Why it’s great:&nbsp;</strong>You can move without being restricted by how high or low the square in front of you is. Need to jump up on top of a cathedral? You can do that! Plus you don’t have to worry about Teleportation failing.</p>

 <h2>Fly</h2> <p><strong>Job:</strong> Bard</p> <p><strong>Cost:</strong> 900</p> <p><strong>Why it’s great:&nbsp;</strong>It looks goofy seeing your character flap around like a Chocobo but flight has some advantages that Ignore Elevation does not. Namely, you can escape if you get cornered by flying over enemies. The price to unlock is exorbitant but it’s never a bad option.</p>

 <h2>Movement +3</h2> <p><strong>Job:</strong> Bard</p> <p><strong>Cost:</strong> 1,000 JP</p> <p><strong>Why it’s great:</strong> This one is also a Bard specialty, meaning female characters can’t learn it. But you can never go wrong with a good old solid plus-three to movement. Every time you go to move your character you’ll be like, whoa, WHOA! It doesn’t have the versatility of the other movement abilities but it’s great for heavy-hitters that need to get around the battlefield quickly.</p>

 <h2><span id="Doublehand">Doublehand</span></h2> <p><strong>Job:</strong> Samurai</p> <p><strong>Cost:</strong> 900 JP</p> <p><strong>Why it’s great:&nbsp;</strong>Doublehand lets you hold one weapon with two hands and doubles the attack power. It’s great for rare greatswords like Excalibur and polearms that require two hands already.</p>

 <h2>Dual Wield</h2> <p><strong>Job:</strong> Ninja</p> <p><strong>Cost:</strong> 1,000 JP</p> <p><strong>Why it’s great:</strong> You can equip two weapons and attack with both. That splits the odds of missing both hits and lets you get bonus stats from the second equipped item. It’s almost always preferable to Dual Wield. Plus it works with the Monk’s Martial Arts, which Doublehand does not.</p> <h2><span id="Equip_Guns">Equip Guns</span></h2> <p><strong>Job: </strong>Orator</p> <p><strong>Cost:</strong> 800</p> <p><strong>Why it’s great:</strong> Guns have great range, basically never miss, and once you unlock the special magic versions, can be extremely powerful. The two jobs that can normally equip guns are pretty weak, so it’s great for pairing with other ones. Plus you can use it with the Knight’s Arts of War to break enemy gear from afar.</p> <h2>Swiftspell</h2> <p><strong>Job: </strong>Time Mage</p> <p><strong>Cost: </strong>700 JP</p> <p><strong>Why it’s great:</strong> The main drawback to the most powerful magic in the game is casting time. Spells that take forever give enemies too much time to move out of the way or to kill you before they go off. Swiftness makes Summons like Cyclops and Lich go off in record time and can make it easy to heal allies in a pinch before they are totally KO’d. On top of that, <i data-stringify-type="italic">The Ivalice Chronicles</i>&nbsp;remaster dialed down some of the casting times for the best spells, so Swiftness will make them land even more quickly.</p> <div role="listitem" aria-roledescription="message" data-qa-hover="true" data-qa="virtual-list-item" data-qa-unprocessed="false" data-qa-placeholder="false" id="message-list_1759440969.970539" tabindex="0" aria-setsize="-1" data-item-key="1759440969.970539"> <p role="group"> <h2 role="group" aria-label="Message actions" data-qa="message-actions">Throw Item</h2> </p> </div> <p><strong>Job: </strong>Chemist</p> <p><strong>Cost:</strong> 350</p> <p><strong>Why it’s great:</strong> Items is one of the most useful action abilities in the game. Adding range to them doubles that utility. There’s simply no substitute for a fully stocked inventory you can deploy across the battlefield without the need to wait for spells or getting into the perfect position.</p>

 <h2>Auto-Potion</h2> <p><strong>Job: </strong>Chemist</p> <p><strong>Cost:</strong> 400</p> <p><strong>Why it’s great:</strong> You learn very early in <em>Final Fantasy Tactics</em> that Auto-Potion is one of the most annoying abilities to fight against. As the name implies, it has a high chance of using a potion after very hit, whether it’s physical damage or magic. It’s usefulness maxes out with X-Potions which restore 150 health, but even in the late game it’s rare that you’ll get hit for substantially more than that. One of the simplest, easiest-to-access abilities in the game will increase the survivability of everyone on your team exponentially, as long as you can afford to restock in-between battles.</p> <h2><span id="First_Strike">First Strike</span></h2> <p><strong>Job: </strong>Monk</p> <p><strong>Cost:&nbsp;</strong>1,300 JP</p> <p><strong>Why it’s great:</strong> Tired: Counter Tackle. Wired: Counter. Inspired: First Strike. Not only do you get to attack the enemy first, but they don’t get to respond at all, so you’re essentially co-opting their entire turn. It only works for melee attacks, however, so its usefulness is limited to hand-to-hand brawls. Still, few things are more satisfying than sending a Ninja into battle and watching them double-strike every Knight in the vicinity before they even get their next turn.</p>

 <h2><span id="Dragonheart">Dragonheart</span></h2> <p><strong>Job: </strong>Dragoon</p> <p><strong>Cost:</strong> 600 JP</p> <p><strong>Why it’s great:</strong>&nbsp;Dragonheart gives your character a chance to cast re-raise on themselves every time they take damage. It’s especially useful for characters you know will get wiped out because it guarantees them another turn when they revive, at which point hopefully the cavalry has arrived either to heal them or provide cover.</p> <h2><span id="Shirahadori">Shirahadori</span></h2> <p><strong>Job: </strong>Samurai</p> <p><strong>Cost: </strong>700 JP</p> <p><strong>Why it’s great:</strong> Once known as Blade Grasp, Shirahadori gives you somewhere between 60-80 percent evasion on every physical attack. It’s supposed to only apply to melee attacks but works for bows too, which is what ultimately makes it better than First Strike. When it comes to survivability, the only thing better than Auto-Potion is never getting hit at all.</p> <h2><span id="Archer's_Bane">Archer’s Bane</span></h2> <p><strong>Job:</strong> Archer</p> <p><strong>Cost:</strong> 450 JP</p> <p><strong>Why it’s great:&nbsp;</strong>So this is basically Shirahadori but worse. It dramatically increases evasion but only for projectiles. Why include it on this list then? It’s cheap and easy to unlock very early on and <em>Final Fantasy Tactics</em> loves to throw enemy Archers at you up through almost the end of the game. Archer’s Bane can keep a Black Mage or Summoner from getting picked off. I prioritized it on my latest playthrough and was surprised how much work it put in.</p> <h2><span id="Critical:_Recover_HP">Critical: Recover HP</span></h2> <p><strong>Job:</strong> Monk</p> <p><strong>Cost:</strong> 500 JP</p> <p><strong>Why it’s great:</strong> Okay, one more for the road. Critical: Recover HP will fully restore your character’s health&nbsp;<em>if</em> the enemy’s attack takes them into near-death but doesn’t outright kill them. That might sound extremely limiting, but there are a surprising number of times when that is exactly what happens during a battle. It’s not as consistent as Auto-Potion and doesn’t provide as much overall value as a First Strike or Shirahadori but it’s a cheaper skill and has some very unique cases where it easily out-performs both thanks to the fact that it can automatically restore all of your character’s health. Pound-for-pound one of the best early-game reactive abilities.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>After 30+ years, longtime <a href="https://kotaku.com/florida-woman-mortal-kombat-legi0n-juicy-2000630181"><em>Mortal Kombat</em></a> audio director Dan Forden is no longer a part of the team working on the fighting series. The veteran game developer, famously known as the guy who pops up in the corner and yells “Toasty!” when uppercutting someone in a <em>Mortal Kombat</em> game, has left NetherRealm.</p> <p>On October 2, <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/fighting/the-guy-who-says-toasty-in-mortal-kombat-has-left-netherrealm-after-more-than-30-years-with-the-team/">as spotted by <em>PC Gamer</em></a>, Forden <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/DPTnVKxE6Ch/">posted on Instagram</a> that Wednesday was his last day at the WB-owned studio behind the <em>Mortal Kombat</em> franchise. Previously, Forden had worked at Midway Chicago, the predecessor to NetherRealm and the studio that originally developed the <em>Mortal Kombat</em> games. Forden has worked on every mainline entry in the franchise, starting with <a href="https://www.imdb.com/name/nm1527016/">1992’s <em>Mortal Kombat</em> all the way up to 2023’s<em> Mortal Kombat 1</em>.</a></p>

  <p>He’s most famous for being the guy who popped up in the corner of the screen during fights in <em>Mortal Kombat II</em> and<a href="https://youtu.be/pRFMgHBNA5Y"> yelled “Toasty!” in a high-pitched voice</a>. This <a href="https://mortalkombat.fandom.com/wiki/Toasty!">Easter egg</a> continued into nearly every subsequent game in the series, including some spin-offs and modern entries. Now, Toasty Dan, as he’s called online, has left behind the franchise he helped build over the last few decades.</p>

 <p>“Wednesday was my last day at NetherRealm,” posted Forden on Instagram. “We made a lot of fun stuff over the years. I’m really proud of what we accomplished as well as how much fun we had making that stuff. There are so many smart, talented people there – look for more great things to emerge over the next several years.”</p>   <p>On Instagram, Forden shared a photo of what appears to be a bathroom inside the studio. And on the mirror inside the bathroom is a little sticker of him yelling his famous catchphrase as seen in <em>MKII</em>. Forden added that he “loved” these “little touches that people left around the studio.”</p> <p>“I wouldn’t have lasted 37 years in the industry if fans weren’t out there playing the games we made,” said Forden. “Thanks to all of you for supporting what we’ve done. Live long and…Toasty!”</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Two of director <a href="https://kotaku.com/quentin-tarantino-best-movies-walton-goggins-kill-bill-1851759855">Quentin Tarantino’s</a> most popular and successful movies, <a href="https://kotaku.com/kill-bills-most-violent-scene-required-blood-wires-an-5936137#!"><em>Kill Bill Vol. 1 </em>and <em>Kill Bill Vol. 2</em></a>, are merging back into one large 4-hour movie as first envisioned. This longer, uncut version will arrive in theaters nationwide in December with 70mm and 35mm showings in some select locations.</p> <p>On October 1, <a href="https://deadline.com/2025/10/kill-bill-the-whole-bloody-affair-release-date-1236567983/">Lionsgate and Tarantino announced</a> plans to combine both volumes of <em>Kill Bill</em> into one large movie. Technically, the director behind <em>Pulp Fiction</em> and <em>Django Unchained</em> has shown a version of<em> Kill Bill Vol 1 </em>and <em>Vol 2</em> edited together at past events. But the <em>Whole Bloody Affair</em> will be the first time that general audiences around the country will get a chance to see the two action-packed revenge movies starring Uma Thurman like this.</p>

 <p>“I wrote and directed it as one movie — and I’m so glad to give the fans the chance to see it as one movie,” said Tarantino. “The best way to see <em>Kill Bill: The Whole Bloody Affair&nbsp;</em>is at a movie theater in glorious 70mm or 35mm. Blood and guts on a big screen in all its glory!”</p>

  <p><em>The Whole Bloody Affair</em> arrives in theaters over 22 years after <em>Kill Bill Vol. 1</em> was first released in 2003. That gory martial arts movie told the first half of the tale of Thurman’s Bride, who seeks revenge after a group of assassins ambushes her wedding and tries to kill her. Originally, <em>Vol. 1</em> ended with a cliffhanger ending that was resolved in <em>Kill Bill Vol. 2,</em> released the following year in 2004. And that movie started with a recap of what happened in the first film. Both the recap and the cliffhanger have been removed from this version to create a more seamless one-film experience. This new version also includes a new seven-minute animated sequence.</p> <p>Tarantino’s <em>Kill Bill: The Whole Bloody Affair</em> arrives in theaters on December 5. It has a runtime of around 4 hours and 18 minutes.</p>

              <p><span>Generative AI continues to plague every creative industry you care about, and despite the obvious copyright infringement and legal cases that surround it, companies like OpenAI keep training their models on licensed art. Sora, OpenAI’s video generation model, launched its updated “Sora 2” model on September 30. The app trains itself on copyrighted material by default, with the burden on </span><a href="https://www.wsj.com/tech/ai/openais-new-sora-video-generator-to-require-copyright-holders-to-opt-out-071d8b2a"><span>copyright holders to actively opt out of it</span></a><span>. As a result, there’s a lot of AI-generated slop leaking out onto the internet featuring huge characters you know and love.</span></p> <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">I tested the AI model Sora 2 on classic anime, the result is hardly believable…</p> <p>I can already see the hundreds of fanmades and parodies that are going to come out! Sora 2 is definitely a new step in AI anime.. <a href="https://t.co/npWkSJjjML">pic.twitter.com/npWkSJjjML</a></p> <p>— Naegiko (@naegiko) <a href="https://twitter.com/naegiko/status/1973171308868542578?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">September 30, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">I am not going to be posting a ton of these or anything but just to get extent of the capabilities and copyright violations of Sora 2, here’s Zagreus riding a scooter through hell (sound on) <a href="https://t.co/zCCNNppQ0k">pic.twitter.com/zCCNNppQ0k</a></p> <p>— Paul Tassi (@PaulTassi) <a href="https://twitter.com/PaulTassi/status/1973377707791552984?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 1, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <p><a href="https://www.404media.co/openais-sora-2-copyright-infringement-machine-features-nazi-spongebobs-and-criminal-pikachus/"><i><span>404 Media</span></i></a> <span>has some videos of Pikachu and what appears to be a Nazi version of SpongeBob SquarePants doing everything from ASMR to boxing matches. By default, Sora 2 can generate animated videos of almost any copyrighted material you prompt it with because genAI companies seem to think the rules governing how copyright IP is typically handled don’t apply to them. So now, companies like Nickelodeon and Nintendo will have to hit OpenAI up to tell the company to stop using their characters and iconography, rather than the other way around. It’s a bold strategy considering that Disney, NBC, and </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/wb-lawsuit-midjourney-ai-art-slop-batman-joker-disney-nbc-2000623232"><span>Warner Bros.</span></a><span> are all </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/midjourney-ai-disney-lawsuit-copyright-marvel-star-wars-1851784340"><span>suing Midjourney</span></a><span> for using characters from their IP. Artists who work on the </span><i><span>Magic: The Gathering </span></i><span>card game have also </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/magic-the-gathering-midjourney-ai-art-lawsuit-1851143250"><span>sued Midjourney for scraping their artwork to train the generative AI model</span></a><span>.</span></p>

 <p><span>The Pokémon Company may </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-responds-to-dhs-video-using-the-original-animes-theme-2000628222"><span>not be taking immediate action against the Department of Homeland Security</span></a><span> for using its characters in a video posted to social media, but I can’t imagine the litigious company is going to sit by while Pikachu’s image is used in AI slop that puts the mascot in a bad light. We’ve reached out to The Pokémon Company, Supergiant Games, and Toei Animation about their respective characters appearing in videos generated by the app.</span></p>

 <p><span>On top of the slop featuring copyrighted characters, Sora 2 seems to let people make deepfakes of </span><a href="https://www.theverge.com/ai-artificial-intelligence/788786/openais-new-ai-sora-ios-social-video-app-will-let-you-deepfake-your-friends"><span>themselves or public figures</span></a><span>. The new app has a TikTok-like feed that lets you endlessly scroll through the generated videos, and if you scroll long enough, you might see deepfakes of real people, despite OpenAI claiming it has safeguards in place to protect people from this. Some have even reported seeing some wild shit, like a blackface version of actor Scarlett Johansson performing in the musical </span><i><span>Hamilton</span></i><span>. OpenAI notably got into </span><a href="https://www.npr.org/2024/05/20/1252495087/openai-pulls-ai-voice-that-was-compared-to-scarlett-johansson-in-the-movie-her"><span>legal hot water</span></a><span> with the actor last year when the company was using a voice that sounded very similar to her performance as an AI in the movie </span><i><span>Her</span></i><span> for its own ChatGPT AI chatbot.</span></p> <div><blockquote data-bluesky-uri="at://did:plc:qc6xzgctorfsm35w6i3vdebx/app.bsky.feed.post/3m23nnoegpc2w" data-bluesky-cid="bafyreibal4konbfyadx3sib5opich4cmc6kg3eei7iyfgvtrjahahj3hru"> <p lang="en">I literally have seen someone posting on Twitter a version of Hamilton where Scarlett Johansson is in it. </p> <p>On top of this likely costing OpenAI a dollar a second to generate, they are potentially going to get sued into a fine paste by multiple different parties</p> <p>— <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/did:plc:qc6xzgctorfsm35w6i3vdebx?ref_src=embed">Ed Zitron (@edzitron.com)</a> <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/did:plc:qc6xzgctorfsm35w6i3vdebx/post/3m23nnoegpc2w?ref_src=embed">2025-09-30T23:13:44.116Z</a></p></blockquote></div>  <p><span>The entire thing seems like a series of legal battles in the making, but it also has some artists and animators disheartened as the possibility looms that animation companies may be increasingly inclined to use it to cut costs at the expense of a human touch.</span></p> <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">Man, sometimes i feel like giving up as a real animator when I look at this.<br>AI animation is advancing way faster than I expected.

Even the more fluid, action-packed scenes Sora generates still have clear tells of AI generation, like unnatural shifts and glitches in the animation. But for any who hope to use this to cut costs, quality is probably not a priority. Bigwigs who insist that AI is the future only do so because they’re the ones who stand to benefit from it, while the artists who create and the people who enjoy their work get the short end of the stick. Maybe some of IP lawyers will step in and try to put a stop to it all, but it sometimes feels like every time one AI slop machine gets taken down, another one sprouts up in its place.</span></p>

              <p>A new update for <a href="https://kotaku.com/borderlands-4-the-kotaku-review-bugs-pc-performance-ending-gearbox-ps5-2000627149"><em>Borderlands 4</em></a> is available now on all platforms, and after installing it you’ll discover that all of the game’s playable vault hunters are now stronger. But one in particular, Amon, is much, much more powerful after the patch, which is great because many (myself included) considered him to be the worst and weakest of the bunch.</p> <p><em>Borderlands 4</em> launched last month to mostly positive reviews and big numbers on Steam. I really like the game and its chaotic mix of looting and shooting, <a href="https://kotaku.com/borderlands-4-pc-performance-dlss-frame-gen-pitchford-gearbox-steam-2000625765">even if performance issues have been a problem</a> <a href="https://kotaku.com/borderlands-4-performance-fps-drops-stutter-ps5-pro-xbox-console-restart-gearbox-2000626487">over the last few weeks</a>. But performance has <a href="https://kotaku.com/borderlands-4-fov-slider-consoles-ps5-update-pc-crashing-patch-performance-2000628823">improved steadily with the last few patches,</a> and now Gearbox is targeting balance tweaks. But don’t worry, the studio isn’t nerfing anything yet. Instead, the latest patch for the open-world FPS is all about buffing the vault hunters. And Amon, a large space warrior, <a href="https://x.com/FervorGamingYT/status/1971346313968316591">got the most buffs following complaints that he wasn’t much fun to play</a> and didn’t feel as exciting during firefights as other characters.</p>

 <p><a href="https://borderlands.2k.com/borderlands-4/update-notes/">On October 2, Gearbox pushed out a new patch for <em>Borderlands 4</em></a> that is focused entirely on improving each of the game’s four vault hunters. After the update, Harlowe does more stasis slam damage, Rafa’s APOPHIS Lance skill is deadlier, and the Siren Vex got some buffs to make some of her builds more viable. But it’s Amon who got the most tweaks by far, with the new patch notes listing 60+ buffs. Yowza! And some of these are huge, with one buff to “Massive Forgewave Damage” being listed as a 100-percent increase!</p>

 <p>While it might seem drastic, Amon truly needed these buffs. I’ve now played as Rafa, Vex, and Amon in <em>Borderlands 4,</em> and by far the most boring and weakest was the big, tanky Amon. It often felt like I was tossing points into his skill tree without ever feeling the effects. Hopefully, these buffs help his kit feel more exciting and effective to use during combat encounters.</p> <p>Anyway, here are the full <em>Borderlands 4</em> patch notes as shared by Gearbox on
