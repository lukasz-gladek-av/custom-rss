              <p>If you’re rushing to grab the latest round of free-ish games included in October’s PS Plus Extra or Premium bundle, you might want to slow your horses slightly and double-check that you aren’t about to accidentally lose your ownership of one of the games forever. Due to an ongoing bug with the PlayStation’s current subscription service, if you previously picked up PS Plus Essential’s giveaway of <em>Yakuza: Like a Dragon</em> in 2022, downloading it again today will erase your license to own it completely!</p> <p aria-label="Post Title: Fun fact: The Crew 2's &quot;Offline Mode&quot; still requires the Internet, and is unplayable during the AWS blackout. (As well as Settlers and probably 90% of Ubisoft's singleplayer games)" aria-describedby="feed-post-credit-bar-t3_1obfk0e">This issue is pointed out by <a href="https://www.playstationlifestyle.net/2025/10/21/ps-plus-extra-essential-yakuza-like-a-dragon-game-license/"><em>PlayStation Lifestyle</em>‘s Zarmena Khan</a>, who has been trying to raise awareness of this hefty problem ever since Sony relaunched its PS Plus service three years ago. It boils down like this: Back in the day, when you downloaded the monthly freebies from PS Plus Essential, they were yours to keep for so long as you maintained your subscription. It was a great deal, and made logging in at the start of a month—well—essential. However, in 2022 this changed, with PS Plus shifting to be more like Microsoft’s Game Pass, such that the games are only accessible to play so long as they remain a part of the PS Plus catalog. Once they’re gone from there, you can no longer play them without paying for the full version. The problem is, if you picked up a game via the Essential service and then re-download it via the modern PS Plus, your original license is permanently overwritten and you’ll lose access to a game you previously owned once its time on the sub comes to an end. And that’s pretty bad!</p>

 <p aria-label="Post Title: Fun fact: The Crew 2's &quot;Offline Mode&quot; still requires the Internet, and is unplayable during the AWS blackout. (As well as Settlers and probably 90% of Ubisoft's singleplayer games)" aria-describedby="feed-post-credit-bar-t3_1obfk0e">This month makes this issue particularly relevant, with <em>Yakuza: Like a Dragon</em>, which was originally given away as part of PS Plus Essential in August 2022, now available in the catalog. Reddit user kabirsingh84 <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/PlayStationPlus/comments/1obn64b/reminder_if_you_claimed_the_ps_plus_essential/">first raised the concern yesterday</a>, reminding people that the PS Plus Extra version that arrives today will delete your license.</p>

   <p>So before you grab it—and indeed any other game added to the PS Plus subscription—make sure to check your library to see if you picked it up any time before 2022. It’s so easy to have grabbed all three games in any given month, forgot you ever did, and then too easily lose your ongoing right to play it.</p> <p>Of course, this all shines a bright light on the degree to which <a href="https://kotaku.com/california-ab-2426-digital-games-the-crew-new-law-psn-1851659641">we increasingly don’t own the majority of the games we play, or even buy</a>, as consumer rights are eroded by deeply dubious digital licenses.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/samsung-quietly-clears-out-galaxy-s25-edge-512gb-before-the-black-friday-rush-while-apple-sticks-to-full-price.1330426/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>As the name implies, the Samsung Galaxy S25 Edge is slim. It measures in at under a quarter inch thick. Beyond that, you’re getting the quintessential Samsung Galaxy experience with this phone.&nbsp;The Samsung Galaxy S25 family of phones come in a few different storage capacity options plus a whole slew of colors, <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4899/">but right now the Edge model with 512GB is deeply on sale. You’ll save 40% on the specifically the titanium silver and titanium jet black options</a>. They normally go for $1,220, but the discount brings them down by $490. That makes it so you only have to pay $730 for a limited time.</p>
<p>Just because this model phone is extra thin, doesn’t mean it’s sacrificing any toughness. Each is made with a durable titanium build along with a Corning Gorilla Glass Ceramic 2 face.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4899/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Superior Photography</h2>
<p>Despite how thin the phone is, the S25 Edge is still able to pack in Samsung’s powerful 200MP camera. You can capture every stunning detail with the highest resolution camera on any Galaxy phone. It also includes and ultra wide auto-focus 12MP camera plus the 12MP selfie camera on the front.</p>
<p>One of the more practical uses of Galaxy AI integration in the S25 Edge is when it comes to the camera. The Samsung smartphone employs a feature called Best Face. You ever set up to take a group photo, snap a bunch in a row, then look back through them only to see there’s something wrong with each of them? Maybe Jolie blinked in the first, then Daniel got distracted and turned his head in the next. None of them are post-worthy. Well, Best Face can intelligently take everyone’s best look across all the photos and stitch them together into one perfect shot. It only takes a few seconds and can provide results for group photos of up to five people.</p>



<p>Selfies are also elevated when taken on the Galaxy S25 Edge. Galaxy AI can recognize your environment’s lighting and capture accurate skin tone, balancing the levels on the fly without any extra editing.</p>
<p>Finding photos through your camera roll has also been made easier. If you’re trying to find a specific pic you took, you can just describe it in your search to have Galaxy AI dig through your photos to bring you to it. Like maybe you dress your dog up as a Dracula for Halloween but you don’t remember what year that was. Just type in “vampire dog” and it should come up.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><span>The </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-legends-za-society-battle-connoisseurs-jacinthe-2000637284"><i><span>Pokémon </span></i><span>franchise</span></a><span> is an excellent propaganda machine. Thanks to the anime focusing so heavily on the powerful bond between </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-anime-ash-ketchum-pikachu-final-episode-netflix-1850805389"><span>Ash and his starter Pokémon, Pikachu</span></a><span>, everyone feels like they </span><i><span>have </span></i><span>to love their first partner in each game. These cute little guys are typically given to you by a professor, and they serve as an early foundation for the rest of the team you’ll build out over the course of the game. But sometimes, you’ll boot one of these games up and realize you don’t like any of your options. Then you’re stuck with this hangnail of a Pokémon you don’t really care about. Friends, what if I told you that there’s another option? One that most trainers, chained down by sentimentality, never even consider? Put that little shit in the box and catch your actual fave.</span></p> <p><span>Every time a new </span><i><span>Pokémon </span></i><span>game comes out, fans decide which of the three starter monsters they’ll be taking out on their adventure. These fire, water, and grass-type Pokémon are meant to give new players a sense of the series’ rock-paper-scissors-style types and weaknesses, and usually end up being faces of the franchise for a few years until the next game comes out. The </span><i><span>Legends </span></i><span>games, however, have handled this a bit differently. Instead of three new critters to start your journey with, these experimental spin-off RPGs bring back old starters from previous games, but with a new twist. </span><i><span>Arceus </span></i><span>gives Rowlet, Cyndaquil, and Oshawatt’s final stages regional variants, and </span><i><span>Z-A </span></i><span>gives Chikorita, Tepig, and Totodile Mega Evolutions.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><i><span>Z-A</span></i><span>, however, has gotten a bit of flak for its starter choice which includes Chikorita and Tepig, arguably two of the least popular starters in </span><i><span>Pokémon </span></i><span>history even though they are both my special babies who have never done anything wrong. So if you fire up a new </span><i><span>Pokémon </span></i><span>game only to find yourself greeted with three Pokémon you’re not particularly thrilled about, are you just forced to use them for several dozen hours? No, my friend. That’s just what Big Pokémon Company wants you to think.</span></p>

 <figure id="attachment_2000005417" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000005417"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000005417">The Pokémon Company</figcaption></figure> <p><span>While I’ve never boxed a starter during my initial playthrough, I’m no stranger to treating my game-sanctioned first partner like any other Pokémon on my team. That’s because the second I boot up one of these games, I’m looking for my real starter: a Pichu or PIkachu. My favorite Pokémon is </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-legends-za-alolan-raichu-quest-how-to-get-mega-2000637259"><span>Raichu</span></a><span>, and because it’s the evolved form of the series’ mascot, my basic ass has the wonderful privilege of knowing my favorite boy is going to be in most games (we don’t talk about </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/only-three-pokemon-are-catchable-in-every-game-but-not-1850461272"><i><span>Black </span></i><span>and </span><i><span>White</span></i></a><span>). So every time I pick a starter in these games, I know they’re going to end up playing second fiddle to my electric rat. I learned at an early age that I don’t have to believe the lie that my starter has to be my best friend, because they’re often just a placeholder for the little yellow guy in my mind. That was true in </span><i><span>Z-A</span></i><span>. I picked Chikorita, and when he evolved into Meganium, he was a surprise MVP of my playthrough thanks to the new grass/fairy-type Mega Evolution. But even though my time in Lumiose City began with this Pokémon, he didn’t </span><i><span>have </span></i><span>to be in my party any longer than it took me to catch another critter. In fact, most games barely acknowledge the starter after you initially get one.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>In </span><i><span>Pokémon Legends: Z-A</span></i><span>, we have one of the more underwhelming starter line-ups ever, at least for people who hate good and cute babies like Chikorita and Tepig, with Totodile being far and away </span><a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/over-half-of-you-are-picking-totodile-as-your-pokemon-legends-z-a-starter"><span>the most popular of the trio</span></a><span>. What if you don’t need a water-type Pokémon in your party because your favorite is Gyarados? Did Totodile’s ugly </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-legends-z-a-mega-evolution-list-new-all-switch-2000621380"><span>Mega Evolution after it becomes Feraligatr</span></a><span> put you off the blue dude altogether? The secret no one at Game Freak wants you to know is that you can put that little guy in a box and make a party that has no starters in it at all. Hell, take it a step further and release that red-headed stepchild back into the wild. </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-legends-za-crossdress-clothing-options-gender-2000637336"><span>Taunie and Urbain</span></a><span> don’t have to know you sent their Pokémon down the street with a bindle. Break free of the chains of decades of Ash and Pikachu brainwashing and write your own story.</span></p>

              <p>Dating isn’t easy. Especially if you happen to be a poor female soul cursed with <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/07/21/magazine/men-heterofatalism-dating-relationships.html?utm_source=newsshowcase&amp;utm_medium=gnews&amp;utm_campaign=CDAQspWt0aOL99lsGPeQp6Hnw_mspQEqDwgAKgcICjCO64oDMJavPA&amp;utm_content=related&amp;gaa_at=g&amp;gaa_n=ASWzDAj2070ceV5niWLiExz7RE6uqIscvHvFTwlASZjfdaIZDJ2TwX8FRRCWk55LxUyicaxQPQ25azo74ocH5pU8rHhCmNd0l0SrXjkLvZyd&amp;gaa_ts=68817188&amp;gaa_sig=FDeQQB0pPPY6GmEQ04nFWesgmVcQDaCT4UAJeHrOWle61WGf2D-tp0pqldaLrNruTgZ6mi9JxAvwOFLYbm0xWQ%3D%3D">wanting to date men</a> (it’s me, I am poor female soul). When they don’t seem checked out, they’re busy telling you the elaborate details of how their marriage collapsed over intimacy issues. Or confiding in you about their secret plans to make everyone in their polycule very unhappy. Maybe they won’t stop talking about video games (which can go either way, really). Or, as upcoming indie narrative game <i>DateBoy</i> simulates, maybe the guy you’re dating won’t stop <i>playing</i> video games. Ugh, my eyes are up here, buddy.</p> <p>Developed by brothers Anton and Henri Pätsi, <i>DateBoy</i> casts you in the role of a boy on a date at an Italian restaurant who is Checked Out™, too busy playing video games under the table while his off-screen date struggles to carry on a conversation. It’s a free narrative game out on Steam and Itch.io next month and it looks delightfully amusing. Check out <a href="https://youtu.be/Ezkq3qqwUu4">the trailer here</a>:</p>

  <p>Essentially you play as a dude on a date, trying to play a platformer that bears a passing resemblance to <i>Gimmick!</i> on a device that’s probably legally distinct from a certain beloved late ‘90s handheld console. While hopping around in the platformer, you’ll have to try and keep up with the usual, tired dating conversational topics such as “How was your day?” with opportunities to deliver those one-word answers that us girls <i>love </i>hearing on a night out.</p> <p>Oh well. At least there’s pizza.</p> <p>The game promises to be no longer than half an hour. <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/4022300/DateBoy/">The Steam listing</a> makes for an amusing read, too. So if you’re looking for what seems to be a cute narrative joint, maybe mark this one on your calendar and try not to stand it up.</p>

<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4898/">The retailer has slashed 35% off this compact powerhouse, bringing the price down to just $299</a>.

<h2>No-Fuss Build, But No Compromises on Performance</h2>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/lego-friends-advent-calendar-is-the-only-one-left-now-selling-42-off-on-amazon-2000637620</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/lego-friends-advent-calendar-is-the-only-one-left-now-selling-42-off-on-amazon.1330348/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>LEGO released its 2025 Advent calendars just a few weeks ago, and they’re already vanishing from Amazon’s shelves at an alarming rate. The<strong> Lego City calendar is completely sold out</strong>, <strong>Minecraft has disappeared</strong>&nbsp;and most other themes have either limited stock or inflated prices. Surprisingly, the <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4905/">Lego Friends Advent Calendar remains available and has dropped to an all-time low of $20, down from its original $34 price</a>. For parents trying to stretch holiday budgets while keeping the magic alive through December, this is one of those deals that won’t last long once word gets out.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4905/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<p>Advent calendars solve a specific parenting challenge every December: Kids need something to channel their excitement during those long weeks leading up to Christmas, and a daily surprise keeps them engaged without the sugar overload of chocolate-filled alternatives. This<strong>&nbsp;set delivers 237 pieces spread across 24 doors, giving children aged six and up</strong> a new building project each morning.</p>
<h2>What’s Different This Year About The Calendar?</h2>
<p>LEGO recently rebranded the Friends theme with greater emphasis on varied storytelling and everyday situations that children are more likely to connect with. This 2025 calendar shows that transition with a holiday sleepover theme that seems more down to earth than releases from earlier years. The package <strong>contains five mini-dolls: Aliya, Autumn, Liann, Nova, and Leo</strong>&nbsp;who come with sleeping mats that complete a whole indoor campout setup. The choice of characters reflects varied personality types and interests so that children may enter the narrative on several different levels.</p>



<p>The animal companions add another layer of play value: <strong>Two dogs, a guinea pig, a gecko, and a cat</strong> come with their own accessories like food stations, water dispensers, scratching posts and pet beds. Each animal’s accessories are scaled to match the mini-doll world so kids can actually integrate them into ongoing play scenarios beyond December.</p>



<p>The day-by-day builds range from tiny accessories in early December to larger interactive pieces as we build up to Christmas. Early dates may open with wrapped gift boxes or a table lamp, while later dates open up the fireplace with flame elements, a working sled with space for a minidoll, and a life-sized LEGO reindeer figure. The karaoke machine features a microphone piece that is compatible with a minidoll’s hand, and the hot chocolate stand includes mugs proportionate to the figures.</p>
<p>The scene-building potential extends well past December 25th. The sofa seats two minidolls comfortably, the Christmas tree comes with decorative elements that can be rearranged, and the hobbyhorse has a spring mechanism built into its base. These aren’t single-use holiday decorations. They <strong>become permanent additions to any existing LEGO Friends collection, compatible with playsets like the Heartlake City buildings</strong> and vehicles sold separately.</p>
<p>At $20, this calendar is cheaper than several single LEGO Friends expansion packs while offering more variety. The retail price of $34 already offered good value compared to purchasing single blind bags or accessory packs over the course of the year.</p>

              <p><span>Selling autographed merchandise has become so lucrative that celebrities and athletes are told </span><a href="https://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/entry/the-very-important-reason-celebrities-wont-use-blue-pens-for-autographs_uk_658059cee4b08e9b410b51f7"><span>not to sign anything with blue ink</span></a><span> because it’s believed that this makes their John Hancock easier to scan and forge. It’s true that if you don’t actually see someone sign something in front of you, it’s pretty difficult to verify if a signature is legitimate, so it’s good to be cautious when buying signed merchandise from a third party. Luckily some public figures, like </span><i><span>Nier </span></i><span>director Yoko Taro, are willing to call out phonies peddling fake autographs for profit.</span></p> <p><span>A </span><i><span>Nier </span></i><span>fan on X sent Taro a screenshot of a now-deleted auction of an autographed </span><i><span>Nier </span></i><span>soundtrack CD that the director had seemingly signed. At a glance, you wouldn’t know that it was forged. It even has a little sketch of Emil, a character from the </span><i><span>Nier</span></i><span> series whose mask Taro wears during public appearances and that he often includes in his signatures. However, Taro himself replied that “nearly half” of the items for sale that are ostensibly bearing his signature are forged, including the one the fan had originally sent. After Taro put it on blast, the original auction listing was taken down.</span></p>

 <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">This autograph is a fake. I include small unknown features in my real autographs to prevent reselling, so I can tell when one isn’t genuine. I've confirmed that nearly half of the autographs being resold are actually fake, so please don't buy them.<br>（◎血◎） <a href="https://t.co/yQVeoYQcfo">https://t.co/yQVeoYQcfo</a></p> <p>— yokotaro (@yokotaro) <a href="https://twitter.com/yokotaro/status/1980304441493582021?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 20, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <p><span>Taro says he includes “small, unknown features” in his signature to identify forgeries. A fan posted an image of Taro’s real signature as seen at a Square Enix event, and the differences are subtle but noticeable upon comparison. The R is longer, and the Y is kind of squiggly.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">heres a real signature to compare everyone from the square enix cafe <a href="https://t.co/Heahqg06bI">pic.twitter.com/Heahqg06bI</a></p> <p>— la reina (rena) 🌽🐓🐟💀🐅😊 (@ashykitten_) <a href="https://twitter.com/ashykitten_/status/1980400732768817636?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 20, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <p><span>Well, that’s another scammer’s day ruined, at least. Hopefully, now that </span><i><span>Nier </span></i><span>fans have been made aware of this, they won’t buy any fake Yoko Taro autographs. It’s also possible that forgeries get better now that those looking to make a quick buck know what to look for. So be careful out there, y’all.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>Normally, this is where I’d talk about what Taro is working on right now, but we don’t really know, actually. I just finished a replay of </span><i><span>Nier: Automata, </span></i><span>and as much as I know people want more of those games, I’m pretty content with where it all ended. Hopefully Square Enix is considering giving </span><i><span>Nier Reincarnation </span></i><span>the </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/octopath-traveler-0-demo-hands-on-impressions-jrpg-2000622687"><i><span>Octopath Traveler 0 </span></i><span>treatment</span></a><span> to bring it to consoles, given that the gacha game is </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/nier-reincarnation-shut-down-1851206958"><span>no longer playable</span></a><span> but contains a lot of major story revelations. </span></p>
