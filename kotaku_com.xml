              <p>Fans of AMD’s GPUs, which are typically more cost-effective than those made by Nvidia, might be in for some sticker shock in the near future. Team Red is likely to start raising the price of its goods. And unfortunately, there’s a chance this will affect more than just your graphics card.</p> <p>As <a href="https://videocardz.com/newz/amd-rumored-to-raise-gpu-prices-just-as-radeon-rx-9070-xt-finally-reaches-msrp">reported by <i>VideoCardz</i></a>, AMD has informed its partners of an impending price hike for its GPUs. Last month the company reportedly adjusted prices for its corporate partners to reflect changes in the market, though it managed to save retail customers from the shift. This time around, however, retail prices are likely to get hit. The culprit? Well, if you’ve been paying attention to the price fluctuations of computer components, you may already know: the cost of DRAM components, which provide the memory for computers and other electronics, is going up as <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/china/samsung-hikes-memory-chip-prices-by-up-60-shortage-worsens-sources-say-2025-11-14/">the AI industry</a> <a href="https://youtu.be/wM8LDVIiwhA">wolfs down</a> the earth.</p>

 <p>And if you’re familiar with what goes inside consoles like the PS5 and Xbox Series machines, or even the upcoming Steam Machine, then you know AMD chips power those too.</p> <p>Retail prices haven’t gone up just yet, but the prospect is frustrating.Sure, PC gaming has always been more expensive than just grabbing the latest Sony/Microsoft/Nintendo box and plugging it in, but it’s continued to get worse. And given the central role AMD plays in all of these devices, PC gamers aren’t the only ones likely to get a haircut.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/nordvpn-is-almost-free-on-black-friday-now-selling-at-77-off-for-us-customers-only-2000645733</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><strong>NordVPN just launched its Black Friday deal this morning</strong> on November 20th and matches Amazon’s Black Friday kickoff with aggressive pricing of its own: The NordVPN <em>Basic</em> plan <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3712/">dropped to a record low of $2.99 per month when you commit to 27 months, which works out to $80.73 total instead of the usual $312.93</a>.</p>
<p>VPN services protect your internet privacy, encrypt your connection and let you access content that’s geographically restricted, but most people skip them because monthly costs add up quickly. This <strong>Black Friday pricing makes premium VPN protection cost less than a fancy coffee each month</strong>, and you<strong> get three extra months</strong> thrown in on top of the two-year commitment.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3712/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See NordVPN</a></p>
<h2>What NordVPN Does for Your Daily Internet Use</h2>
<p>NordVPN <strong>encrypts all the data that travels between your device and the internet</strong> which prevents your internet service provider, government agencies, or hackers on public Wi-Fi from seeing what you are doing online. Normally, your ISP tracks every website you visit and can sell that data to advertisers or hand it over to authorities without your knowledge. The encryption forms a security tunnel that scrambles your traffic into unreadable code and anyone intercepting it sees only gibberish instead of your passwords, bank details, or browsing history.</p>
<p>The service<strong> works by masking your actual IP address</strong> and routing your connection through NordVPN’s servers in the country of your choice. Websites and online services will see the VPN server’s IP address instead of your own, effectively blocking them from tracking your physical location or compiling deeply detailed profiles of what you do online. Based on where you choose, you could appear to browse from within the UK, Japan or anywhere else NordVPN has servers.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3712/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See NordVPN</a></p>
<p>NordVPN currently operates <strong>more than 6,000 servers across 111 countries</strong> which builds the required structure for fast and reliable connections, no matter where you are located or through which region you connect. The distributed server network allows one to always find a nearby server that will impact your speed very little, or connect to distant servers when you need to access specific regional content. Based in Panama, this country has no obligatory data retention laws: It’s also outside of international agreements, including Five Eyes surveillance. In this context, <strong>NordVPN can follow its strict no-logs policy</strong> without any government pressure to capture user data.</p>
<p>For $2.99 per month, the <em>Basic</em> plan will get you the core VPN functionality: secure, fast connections, and the ability to use the service on up to 10 devices simultaneously. Protect your laptop, phone, and tablet, or configure your router to lock down every device on your home network with a single VPN connection. <strong>The 30-day money-back guarantee</strong> lets you try out the service completely risk-free, and you’ll receive a full refund if it doesn’t meet your needs. You’ll save 74% compared to paying month-to-month, and the total cost for 27 months plus those three bonus months drops to just $80.73.</p>
<p>NordVPN Plus plan jumps to $3.89 per month and adds anti-malware protection, ad blocking, tracker blocking and a password manager with breach scanner. Complete at $4.89 monthly includes everything in Plus plan plus scam call protection and 1TB of encrypted cloud storage. Prime plan at $6.89 monthly adds NordProtect identity protection with cyber crime monitoring and insurance coverage.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/beats-solo-4-headphones-2000645533</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/amazon-turns-beats-solo-4-into-apple%E2%80%99s-cheapest-headphone-for-black-friday.1359310/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Good headphones that offer solid sound quality, have a reliable battery life, and are comfortable to wear for an extended period are hard to find. And when you do find a pair that offers all this, the price tag isn’t always the most friendly. In fact, most such options sit well over $250.</p>
<p>Thankfully, that’s not the case today. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5737/">Amazon, like most other retailers, is offering plenty of impressive early Black Friday discounts you can score ahead of the event.</a> It has also dropped the price of the top-rated Beats Solo 4 by 35%! Normally, these would run you around $200, but you can now grab them for just $130. It’s one of the lowest we have seen this pair go for in a long time, and the offer applies to all color options. Looking for something minimal? The matte black version looks stunning. Want something with a bit more personality to it? Pink and blue color options are just as heavily discounted. Just note that, like most other big discounts, this one won’t be around for long. If you have been wanting to grab a premium pair without spending a ton, now is the time to act.</p>
<p>Add the product to your cart, and the discount will apply automatically; no coupon codes or complicated procedures to worry about!</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5737/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Sound That Pulls You In</h2>
<p>These headphones feature a premium design. The overall build is super lightweight, and the headband folds down safely when not in use. This means the pair doesn’t take up much space in bags; just fold it, toss it in, and you’re good to go. They are also quite comfortable to wear, thanks to the UltraPlush ear cushions that fit nicely and stay in place throughout the day. You can wear them for hours while travelling, streaming, or gaming without feeling uneasy.</p>
<p>Powerful sound is made possible with a custom acoustic architecture and updated drivers that deliver the brand’s signature sound. Expect rich, deep audio, whether you’re listening to a podcast, vibing to your favorite songs, or winding down after a long day with some relaxing music. These also support spatial audio with dynamic head tracking for a more immersive, surround-sound experience, which pulls you in. This mode makes it feel like you’re part of whatever’s playing, in real-time, from concerts to action-packed movies.</p>



<p>Best of all, plugging in via USB-C or 3.5mm audio cable lets you stream in a format that preserves the original quality of any recording; perfect for when you want to experience a more detailed texture in your music. Calls get a boost, too. The upgraded microphones are smart enough to automatically reject background noise (chatter, laughter, traffic) on your end while precisely targeting your voice. You can attend meetings and catch up with friends even in busy cafes and chaotic subways!</p>
<p>The battery is designed to last up to 50 hours on a full charge. That’s more than enough to go at least a couple of days without worrying about plugging the pair in. Recharging is fast, as well, and you can get an additional five hours of listening with just a quick 10-minute top-up. Compatibility-wise, the Beats Solo 4 work well with both Android and iOS devices. Pairing them with smartphones, tablets, computers, and more hardly takes a few minutes.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5737/">The pair is now down to $130, which makes grabbing these quite affordable right now.</a> The discount could wrap up soon, however, which is why it’s best to get your orders in without wasting time. All color options are discounted, so you can grab the one that suits your aesthetics the best.</p>

              <p>Homer will break new ground in <em>Fortnite</em>: his underpants version will blast its nips, unlike every previous bare-chested skin before it. It’s all seemingly part of the next beat in the battle royale’s <a href="https://kotaku.com/simpsons-fortnite-homer-mascots-santa-monica-2000645254">ongoing <em>Simpsons</em> mini-season</a>.</p> <p>While a giant naked Homer was shown off in the latest “<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=buwIZkFuBA0">Multiplidiocy</a>” animated trailer this week, the actual giant Homer skin <a href="https://twitter.com/DrCacahuette/status/1991097774012797411?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1991097774012797411%7Ctwgr%5E6b2bc80873737b841841aee64dc4d0c99c09bc95%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamespot.com%2Farticles%2Fleaked-underwear-homer-would-be-first-fortnite-skin-with-nipples%2F1100-6536357%2F">has also leaked</a> ahead of its introduction to the game, confirming the existence of nipples. Casual fans might be thinking, “So what? I’ve seen Homer’s nipples dozens of times before.” Yes, yes you have. We all have. But not in <em>Fortnite</em>, a game which has famously refused to put nipples on character skins until now.</p>

 <p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/leaked-underwear-homer-would-be-first-fortnite-skin-with-nipples/1100-6536357/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f">As <em>GameSpot</em> points out</a>, a shirtless Travis Scott performed nipple-less in<em> Fortnite</em> way back in 2019. Bare-chested skins for Castaway Jonesy, Menace, TheGrefg, Raz, Dude, and others all had their nipples nerfed as well. Kong was not immune. Neither was Avatar’s Aang. Even Drax and Blanka had their glands removed. The <a href="https://www.google.com/url?sa=i&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.resetera.com%2Fthreads%2Fhelp-me-understand-male-nipples-in-japanese-media.455356%2F&amp;psig=AOvVaw35zTq1Jgy_2Lw9GQ7eKL7n&amp;ust=1763734655381000&amp;source=images&amp;cd=vfe&amp;opi=89978449&amp;ved=0CBkQjhxqFwoTCPCNtOT1gJEDFQAAAAAdAAAAABAE">mighty Goku</a> was stripped as well.</p>

 <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">First look at New (Giant) Homer Skin! <a href="https://t.co/LI2ibt7SfM">pic.twitter.com/LI2ibt7SfM</a></p> <p>— Dr Cacahuette – FN Leaks (@DrCacahuette) <a href="https://twitter.com/DrCacahuette/status/1991097774012797411?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 19, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <p>So why is Homer different? Is he just more cartoony than the others, and so Epic Games is less squeamish about adding a pair of dots to his cel-shaded character model? Or is this the company dipping its first toe into the pond, with more realistic anatomy to eventually follow for other characters?</p>

 <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/here-are-a-bunch-of-other-video-game-nipples-1818495101">Other companies</a> haven’t shied away from adding nipples to lots of other cartoon-y video game characters. Sora from <em>Kingdom Hearts</em> had nipples all the way back in the PS2-era, when they probably took all week to animated and half the RAM to render. Even Nintendo bravely <a href="https://kotaku.com/marios-supposed-to-be-cute-which-is-why-his-nipples-gr-1828557226">let&nbsp;Mario’s nips go free</a> in <em>Super Mario Odyssey</em>, though it has <a href="https://kotaku.com/nintendo-it-seems-has-removed-marios-nipples-1844723285">occasionally censored them</a> in other contexts.</p> <p>It’s nice to see Epic Games finally catching up.</p> <p><em>Fortnite</em>‘s <em>Simpsons</em> season is set to end on November 28, so it probably won’t be long until whatever final showdown Epic has planned with giant naked Homer goes into effect. That’s likely when the new skin will drop. After that, well, the company is already trying to get fans hyped for its next big Hollywood takeover: <a href="https://kotaku.com/fortnite-kill-bill-yukis-revenge-lost-chapter-tarantino-2000645687"><em>Kill Bill</em></a>.</p>

              <p>LEGO make for wonderful gifts during the holidays. The catalog of sets LEGO offers is unthinkably vast, ranging from capturing memorable moments across our favorite media like that of Star Wars or Marvel all the way to simple sets aimed more at adults designed for display. Think those LEGO flower bouquets every slightly nerdy millennial has in their living rooms. This set here leans a little closer to the latter. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5736/">LEGO has a buildable cat on sale right now for 20% off. Not just any cat—a tuxedo cat.</a> This will make the perfect gift for any tuxedo cat owner this upcoming holiday. They’ll put it together and think, “it looks just like Tux!” (every tuxedo cat owner seems to name theirs Tux for some reason. Well anyway, right now this 20% discount will end up shaving $20 off the standard $100 price tag. That brings it down to just $80 for a limited time.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5736/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Perfect Holiday Gift for Cat Owners</h2>
<p>This lifelike LEGO cat model is built to actual size, standing over 12.5 inches tall and made from 1,710 pieces to bring to life its distinctive black fur and white underbelly. It makes a wonderful gift for anyone with a passion for animals, art, or design, but especially for cat owners. Particularly those who own a tuxedo cat themselves.</p>
<p>The set is interactive. The cat’s features are all adjustable so you can display yours to your liking. Rotate the head or adjust the ears, paws and tail. You can even reconfigure the cat to have it’s mouth be open or closed. And yes, when it’s open, there is a little pink piece in there so you cat can blep.</p>



<p>Even the eyes are swappable. The set comes with a pair of yellow eyes in addition to a pair of blue eyes, so you can make it match your own cat. Or go for the stunning heterochromia look with one yellow and one blue.</p>
<p>The LEGO Builder app can help make the build even easier. View each step with a 3D digital version so you can get a better look at some of those weird angles that don’t print well in the instruction booklet. You can zoom in and rotate the model around even bookmark your progress so you can walkaway and come back later to complete your build.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5736/">Ahead of Black Friday, you can grab this tuxedo cat for display from LEGO for a solid $20 off over at Amazon.</a></p>
