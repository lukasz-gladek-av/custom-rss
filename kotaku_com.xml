              <p><span>The Pokémon Company seems likely t</span><span>o reveal the upcoming Generation X games in February on the series’ 30th anniversary, but if leakers have anything to say about it, Game Freak might not have much new information to give us by the time that showcase arrives. On December 24, a series of new leaks about the games, allegedly titled </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-leak-generation-10-wind-wave-galar-legends-mmo-2000635337"><i><span>Pokémon Wind </span></i><span>and </span><i><span>Wave</span></i></a><span>, began spreading online. We’ve gotten a few waves (sorry) of information since </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-wind-wave-pikachu-leak-generation-10-redesign-2000635674"><span>the massive Teraleak</span></a><span> in October, but now we know a little bit more about the games’ map, battle gimmick, and have even our first look at the new region’s professor.</span></p> <p><span>The latest info was posted on X early today by self-described <a href="https://x.com/i/status/2003786462651932797">Pokémon detective Moot Monthly</a>. All of these new images, animations, and illustrations are reportedly from this existing leak, so it’s entirely possible they aren’t indicative of the final games that will eventually ship on Switch 2. But they do give us some interesting insight into what Game Freak has been working on for the next mainline entries.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">Christmas came early, heres ur pokemon gen 10 leaks </p> <p>&gt;Gen 10 map<br>&gt;Majin Pikachu<br>&gt;professor<br>&gt;gameplay</p> <p>Join gaiachads discord for a q&amp;a when i wake up link in bio <a href="https://t.co/QmIuuTqgTi">pic.twitter.com/QmIuuTqgTi</a></p> <p>— Moot /ムート (@Mootmonthly) <a href="https://twitter.com/Mootmonthly/status/2003786462651932797?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 24, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <p><span>First, we have a new look at the beta versions of the male and female protagonists, and their previously reported Rotom scooter that they’ll ride around on. </span><i><span>Pokémon Legends: Z-A </span></i><span>really popped off with its fashion, so hopefully we’ll be able to customize our characters’ fits in </span><i><span>Wind </span></i><span>and </span><i><span>Wave</span></i><span>.</span></p>

 <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="zxx" dir="ltr"><a href="https://t.co/IcoKrFa5cx">pic.twitter.com/IcoKrFa5cx</a></p> <p>— (Not) Centro Leaks (@CentroLeaks_alt) <a href="https://twitter.com/CentroLeaks_alt/status/2003487471536153050?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 23, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <p><span>Next, we have some early renders of the games’ professor and the Pokémon Center. Apparently, the professor will ride around in a car and appear in multiple locations in the games’ archipelago setting. Right now, all we know is that he appears to be an older man with thick eyebrows and a beard.</span></p>

 <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="de" dir="ltr">Pokémon Gen 10 leak: the new Professor (he drives around in a car!) and how the new Pokémon Centers will look <a href="https://t.co/erGuj76bUM">https://t.co/erGuj76bUM</a></p> <p>— Centro LEAKS (@CentroLeaks) <a href="https://twitter.com/CentroLeaks/status/2003838143943094555?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 24, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <p><span>Speaking of the archipelago, we also have a new illustration of the Gen X region. Its beta map shows several islands that the player will be able to explore. Early reports say they will be procedurally generated, so it’s unclear if the map is a sort of presumed “default” shape for these islands or if the terrain is what changes for each player, rather than the shape of the landmass.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="ht" dir="ltr">Pokémon Gen 10 leak: here’s the beta map of the new region. <a href="https://t.co/ZNML8djcEu">https://t.co/ZNML8djcEu</a></p> <p>— Centro LEAKS (@CentroLeaks) <a href="https://twitter.com/CentroLeaks/status/2003837845975474261?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 24, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <p><span>The last and perhaps most interesting detail from the latest leak is a first-look at this gen’s battle gimmick codenamed “Majin.” This will reportedly be a factor in something called “weather moves,” but we still don’t know what those will entail. What we can see for now is that this phenomenon will seemingly distort a Pokémon’s physical shape and then create some kind of cloud to obscure them. Looking at what this shit does to Pikachu in the leaked animation, I’m not immediately onboard. But hey, it’s leaked in-development footage from a hack. We’ll see how it actually changes up battles when the games are eventually revealed.</span></p>

For now, </span><i><span>Pokémon Legends: Z-A</span></i><span>’s </span><i><span>Mega Dimension </span></i><span>DLC is keeping me busy, so I’m not starving for something new right now.</span></p>
