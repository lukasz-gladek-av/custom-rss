            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Nintendo just reversed course on one of its most controversial changes to <em>Mario Kart World</em>, sorta. The Switch 2 maker just buffed the appearance rate of three-lap courses after <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/mario-kart-world-patch-notes-random-online-switch-2-1851785133&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/mario-kart-world-patch-notes-random-online-switch-2-1851785133">previously nuking a sneaky workaround</a></span> players had been exploiting to avoid the new game’s in-between driving sections. Somehow that’s not even the biggest change in the game’s first major update since launch. The Switch 2's biggest exclusive is back on the menu. </p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="197565" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="Nintendo Switch 2 Could Launch With Almost No Reviews" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="122" data-playlist="197565,197567,195670" data-current="197565"><div><p>Nintendo Switch 2 Could Launch With Almost No Reviews</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197565/197565_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197565/197565_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197565/197565_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/23089.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p><em>Mario Kart World </em><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://en-americas-support.nintendo.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/68580/~/how-to-update-mario-kart-world&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://en-americas-support.nintendo.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/68580/~/how-to-update-mario-kart-world" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">version 1.2.0</a></span> includes new features, lots of game tweaks, and some massive rebalancing. One thing that might bring back some lapsed players is this patch note: “Increased the frequency of lap-type courses appearing in the selection when choosing the next course in ‘VS Race’ and wireless races.” Fans are taking that to mean that traditional three-lap stages will be more frequent, including when playing online. </p><p>A big criticism of the game has been throwing lots of straightaway, interstitial courses into the mix that just have players racing between the actual tracks they want to play on. When<em> Mario Kart World</em> first released, choosing “random” while playing online automatically removed these tracks from the selection pool. The community’s preference was so strong it became common to see all 24 players in a race choose random. So, Nintendo being Nintendo, they got rid of that workaround in an apparent attempt to “force” fans to play <em>Mario Kart World</em> “the right way.” </p><p>The company now seems to have backed off a bit, though it’s anybody’s guess whether it was “bullied” into accommodating players’ preferences or simply wanted to try and fix how the random selection option worked without making everyone extra miserable. In any case, <em>Mario Kart World </em>version 1.2.0<em>&nbsp;</em>is so big, that’s not even the most consequential part of the update. Far from it, in fact.</p><p>“Made COM weaker in everything other than ‘Battle,’” reads a major change that’s already rippling throughout the community with fans unsure whether to embrace the difficulty nerf or call for an unofficial “hard” mode to return. Grand Prix and Knockout races could get pretty gnarly at 150cc (a 200cc mode doesn’t exist in the game yet, though many suspect it will get added at some point), and it’s not just the higher speeds that make things tricky. </p><p>Instead, its CPU racers tricking off every surface in sight and hammering players with shells and other items. <em>Mario Kart World</em>’s item box RNG also tends to incentivize players “bagging” it in last place before trying shoot up the ranks with the powerful items they’ve earned. Twenty-four players also means races have huge middle packs with double the carnage of previous <em>Mario Kart</em> games. We’ll see how it shakes out, but some players are already claiming special bragging rights for unlocking three stars—the highest performance rating—on all races before the CPU nerf. </p><p>Other significant patch notes include “made homing of Boomerang weaker” and “On the ‘Free Roam’ map, when you gather all of the P Switches, ? Panels, and Peach Medallions, the colors of the various numbers will now change.” There are also dozens of fixes to race tracks where players were previously falling through the map or getting snagged on trees and other obstacles. It’ll take some time to see how all the changes shake out, but it definitely feels like we’ve entered <em>Mario Kart World</em>’s first official “We’re so back” era. </p><p>Here are the full patch notes for ver. 1.2.0:</p><blockquote data-type="BlockQuote"><h2 id="h421390"><a id=""></a><strong>Latest update: Ver. 1.2.0 (Released July 29, 2025)</strong></h2><p><strong>General</strong></p><ul data-type="List" data-style="Bullet"><li>In the “VS Race” of “Single Player”, added “No COM” to the COM rules.</li><li>In the “VS Race” of “Single Player” and “Multiplayer”, added “Mushrooms only” to the item rules.</li><li>You can now choose “View Replay” after downloading ghost data in “Time Trials”.</li><li>You can now choose whom to watch when spectating in “Knockout Tour” and “Balloon Battle” in “Online Play”, “Wireless Play”, and “LAN Play”.</li><li>You can now see the waiting time until the next race or battle starts in “Online Play”, “Wireless Play”, and “LAN Play”.</li><li>When using CameraPlay in “Multiplayer” and “Online Play”, the game will now remember the camera cursor position and size until the player closes the game.If you change the number of people playing, the cursor position and size will return to their original settings.</li><li>On the “Free Roam” map, when you gather all of the P Switches, ?

" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>“Seeing the rise of censorship and claiming it’s to ‘protect kids,’ it sounds almost like the Satanic Panic, targeting people that have done nothing to anyone except having fun,” Martinez told <em>Kotaku</em>. “We’re already seeing the negative effect this has on people’s personal and financial lives because of such unnecessary restrictions. If parents are so concerned over protecting kids, then they should parent their own kids instead of forcing other people to meet their ridiculous demands.”</p><p>Indie horror game <em>Vile: Exhumed</em> <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://bloody-disgusting.com/video-games/3890112/vile-exhumed-banned-from-steam/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://bloody-disgusting.com/video-games/3890112/vile-exhumed-banned-from-steam/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">is one of the titles</a></span> that’s been banned from Steam by Valve. Released last year by Cara Cadaver of Final Girl Games, it has players rummage through a fictional ‘90s computer terminal to uncover a twisted man’s toxic obsession with an adult horror film actress, using this format to engage with themes of online misogyny and toxic parasocial relationships. “It was banned for ‘sexual content with depictions of real people,’ which, if you have played it, you know is all implied, making this all feel even worse,” Cadaver <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://bsky.app/profile/dirtlord77.bsky.social/post/3lv2264j6sk2c&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://bsky.app/profile/dirtlord77.bsky.social/post/3lv2264j6sk2c" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">wrote on Bluesky</a></span> on July 28.<br></p><p>Valve did not immediately respond to a request for comment. </p><p><em>Vile: Exhumed </em>is a textbook example of what critics of the sex game purge always feared: that guidelines aimed at clamping down on pornographic games believed to be encouraging or glorifying sexual violence would inevitably ensnare serious works of art grappling with difficult and uncomfortable subject matter in important ways. Who gets to decide which is which? For a long time, it appeared to be Steam and Itch.io. Last week’s purges revealed it’s actually Visa and Mastercard, and whoever can frighten them the most with bad publicity.</p><p>“Things are definitely changing as reports of responses to calls have gone from ‘Sorry what are you talking about?’ to then ‘Are you ALSO calling about itch/steam’ to now some [callers] receiving outright harassment,” a 2D artist who goes by Void and who has helped organize a Discord for a reverse call-in campaign told <em>Kotaku</em>. It’s hard to have any clear sense of the scope of these counter-initiatives or what ultimate impact they might have on the companies in question, but anecdotally the effort seems to be gaining traction. For instance, callers are now needing to spend less time explaining what Steam, Itch.io, or “NSFW” games are to the people on the other end of the line. </p><p>“For calls I was originally focusing on Mastercard, but I ended up getting a lot of time out of Visa,” Bluesky user RJAIN told <em>Kotaku</em>. “Two days ago I had a call with Visa that lasted over an hour, and a follow-up call later on that lasted over 2.5 hours.  Those calls, I spoke with a supervisor and they seemed very calm and understanding.  Yesterday, the calls were different. The reps seemed angry and exhausted. They refused to let me speak to a supervisor and kept insisting that it is now protocol for them to disconnect the call on anyone complaining about this issue.”</p><p>Bluesky user snowlupinwood, an LGBT furry author whose work was impacted on itch.io, said calls were juggled between various managers until one earlier this week led to a 30-minute exchange with a manager reading from a script, while subsequent calls led to quickly getting disconnected. Another person who claimed to call at least 30 times said the interactions have also changed since last week when the purges on itch.io and Steam first happened. </p><figure id="" data-id="cdb956f129ecb431e093e7f8254b663c" data-recommend-id="image://cdb956f129ecb431e093e7f8254b663c" data-format="png" data-width="858" data-height="770" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A screenshot shows scripts advocates are sharing to speaking to credit card companies.

" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>“Now, as soon as I mention anything in regards to the issue of censorship, they immediately tell me to email,” Bluesky user sakurakyun told <em>Kotaku. “</em>Even if I ask for a supervisor, some even hung up on me after pretending they were transferring me.  Others started cutting me off and started their ‘ending speech’ informing me they can no longer help me and to email.  Some even started mocking me and telling me that they recognize my number and they ask me before I said anything if I called before.  I am very concerned with my next phone call but I will be continuing to call until they change something. I am not scared of being yelled at, I’ve been working in customer service for almost 5 years now.”</p><p>Visa and Mastercard did not immediately respond to requests for comment. </p><p>Some say the exchanges have remained polite while others say they’ve been put on hold indefinitely. “It’s clearly having an impact,” RJAIN said. “They are changing how they deal with calls and they sound exhausted with the issue. There are often queue times when I call.” The ACLU, which has been critical of credit card companies being leveraged to censor sex work online, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://bsky.app/profile/aclu.org/post/3lv4g32jhgc2p&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://bsky.app/profile/aclu.org/post/3lv4g32jhgc2p" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">also commented on the issue on Tuesday</a></span>, though it hasn’t shared any direct actions it might be pursuing on behalf of effected creators. </p><p>Some industry trade groups have also weighed in. The International Game Developers Association (IGDA) released a statement stating that “censorship like this is materially harmful to game developers” and urging a dialogue between “platforms, payment processors, and industry leaders with developers and advocacy groups.” “We welcome collaboration and transparency,” it wrote. “This issue is not just about adult content. It is about developer rights, artistic freedom, and the sustainability of diverse creative work in games.”</p><p>For the time being, that dialogue appears to mostly be taking place at Visa’s and Mastercard’s call centers, at least when they allow it. </p><p>.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://kotaku.com/steam-itch-io-sex-game-nsfw-censor-visa-mastercard-1851787281]]></content:encoded>
