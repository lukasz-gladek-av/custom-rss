            <guid>1413037</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>If you use a Steam Deck or another handheld PC for games or work, and want to switch to a bigger screen for a more immersive experience, a dedicated dock can help.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6343/">Right now, the 6-in-1 Ugreen Steam Deck dock is on sale at Amazon for $30, down from its usual (and already affordable) $46 price</a>. You’re saving an impressive 35% on an option that packs a punch and offers solid compatibility across a range of devices. Shipping will be free for Prime users, so they’re saving a bit on that front, too.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6343/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Comes With a Foldable Stand</h2>
<p>The dock supports HDMI 2.1 output with up to 4K@120Hz, plus VRR, FreeSync, and G-Sync. It’s made to deliver an incredibly smooth and immersive gaming or movie playback experience without screen tearing or noticeable lag. You’ll enjoy sharp, vibrant visuals on compatible displays for all your favorite titles.</p>
<p>There’s 100W PD 3.0 fast charging support, too. The Steam Deck dock delivers up to 85W to your host device, while also powering itself, which means you can keep the connected device charged and running without relying on an external power solution. This is also great for ensuring the secondary device doesn’t run out of power in the middle of an important session with friends.</p>



<p>Port-wise, you’re getting two USB-A 3.0 ports, a USB-C data port, Gigabit Ethernet, and the HDMI output. These are more than enough to connect a bunch of peripherals, from controllers to keyboards and external storage solutions, without feeling limited. The thing plays nicely with gaming handhelds like Steam Deck, ROG Ally, ROG Xbox Ally, ROG Xbox Ally X, Region Go, and is also fully compatible with laptops, PCs, Macs, and phones.</p>
<p>Getting started couldn’t be easier. The dock offers a simple plug-and-play setup across Windows, macOS, Linux, and SteamOS, meaning there’s no need to worry about installing drivers or following complicated setup processes. Connect it to your device, and you’re good to go in no time. Just note that the dock is mainly designed for PC-based setups, so it is not compatible with Nintendo Switch 2. Additionally, the built-in foldable stand holds your handheld safely in place as you teach the bad guys a lesson. It’s made out of aluminum alloy and PC+ABS, so it’s sturdy for both daily use and occasional travel.</p>
<p>You can now enjoy all these features and a lot more for just $30, which is basically nothing considering the convenience this dock brings. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6343/">The 35% discount is open to all shoppers, but it ends soon.</a> If you’ve been looking for a way to play your favorite titles better, now is the time to make the move.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><span>People who play gacha games sometimes tell me they’ve spent thousands of dollars in them over the course of years of playing, but in those situations at least they’re doing so on purpose and with full knowledge of their actions. </span><i><span>Arknights: Endfield</span></i><span> players, however, were charged thousands of dollars for mundane microtransactions due to a Paypal glitch, prompting developer Hypergryph to take the option to make purchases through the service offline. Not a great start to the game’s launch today.</span></p>   <p><span>Players reported (thanks, </span><a href="https://www.thegamer.com/arknights-endfield-paypal-launch-issues/"><i><span>TheGamer</span></i></a><span>) multiple odd Paypal charges from the game in various currencies and amounts within hours of </span><i><span>Arknights: Endfield</span></i><span>’s launch, ranging anywhere from a few dollars up to </span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Endfield/comments/1qjj50k/comment/o0zecyy/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button"><span>the equivalent of $3,300 USD</span></a><span>. The glitch seemed to </span><a href="https://clips.twitch.tv/DifficultCooperativeAntDuDudu-5OOgZdEZo-lg2RNm"><span>charge players for other users’ purchases</span></a><span> if their Paypal account was linked to the game, hence why some players saw charges in different currencies from around the world, rather than solely in their own domestic currency.</span></p>

 <p><span>Developer Hypergryph was made aware of the issue and has since </span><a href="https://x.com/AKEndfield/status/2014188503891099888?s=20"><span>taken the game’s Paypal compatibility offline</span></a><span>, and recommends players use any other means of purchasing microtransactions for the time being.</span></p> <blockquote><p><span>We have received reports that the PayPal payment channel is currently undergoing temporary maintenance and upgrades.</span></p> <p><span>All affected Endministrators are advised to use other available payment channels.</span></p> <p><span>Transactions involving abnormal item delivery or payment deduction will be handled accordingly.</span></p></blockquote> <p><span>Well, it couldn’t possibly get any worse for launch day, right? God willing. Hopefully those four-figure charges weren’t too widespread. Hypergryph says it will be handling all these erroneous transactions, but I wouldn’t be surprised if the company also gave out some in-game currency or rewards as an apology. If you’re playing </span><i><span>Arknights: Endfield</span></i><span>, keep an eye out for any odd transactions for a bit in case this affects other payment options as well.</span></p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/amazon-clears-out-amd-ryzen-9-cpu-at-its-lowest-price-after-a-sudden-discount-16-core-32-thread-processor-2000661946</link>
            <guid>1412983</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>PC hardware deals don’t always line up this cleanly, but this one is hard to ignore. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6822/">Amazon has dropped the price of AMD’s Ryzen 9 9950X by 20%, knocking it down to $519 from its original $649 launch price.</a> For anyone planning a new gaming PC or looking to anchor a high-end upgrade, this discount puts one of AMD’s most powerful consumer CPUs firmly within reach.</p>
<p>Building a PC might look intimidating at first glance, but the real challenge usually comes long before a screwdriver ever touches a case. Sorting through spec sheets, comparing model numbers, and figuring out what actually delivers value can feel overwhelming. CPUs in particular tend to blur together when clock speeds, core counts, and generation labels start stacking up. Finding a processor that’s got power and long-term relevance that doesn’t break the bank is key. So please direct your attention to the AMD Ryzen 9 9950X.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6822/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2 data-start="870" data-end="911">A Flagship CPU Built for Modern Gaming</h2>
<p>Only a little more than a year old, the Ryzen 9 9950X sits at the top of AMD’s consumer lineup. With 16 cores and 32 threads. It’s designed to handle far more than today’s games alone. Paired with a strong GPU, this processor can comfortably drive high refresh rate gaming, including demanding titles running at ultra settings. High-resolution streaming, background apps, and content creation tasks won’t slow it down either.</p>
<p>Clocked at a base speed of 4.3 GHz, the Ryzen 9 9950X delivers excellent performance right out of the box. Anyone who like to squeeze out extra power will appreciate that the chip is fully unlocked for overclocking, with boost speeds reaching up to 5.7 GHz under the right conditions. That extra headroom can make a noticeable difference for video encoding, 3D rendering, and competitive gaming scenarios where every frame counts.</p>



<p>AMD’s Ryzen Master software adds another layer of control. The utility provides real-time monitoring of temperatures, voltages, clock speeds, and memory timings, all from a clean interface. Custom profiles make it easy to switch between performance-focused settings and quieter, power-efficient configurations depending on the task. Keep in mind that the Ryzen 9 9950X does not ship with a stock cooler, and AMD recommends pairing it with a quality liquid cooling solution to maintain optimal performance.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6822/">At $519, the Ryzen 9 9950X is a serious investment, but also a smart one</a>. CPUs of this caliber tend to age gracefully, staying relevant for years as games and software continue to evolve. This is the kind of processor that can serve as the backbone of a system well into the next generation of PC gaming. With the current Amazon discount in play, now is an excellent moment to lock in elite performance at a much more approachable price.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/samsungs-nintendo-switch-2-optimized-microsd-card-crashes-to-its-lowest-price-at-under-0-16-per-gb-2000661937</link>
            <guid>1412962</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p data-start="0" data-end="594">Nintendo’s next-generation console, the Switch 2, has already had a strong start. Since launching earlier last year, Nintendo’s follow-up to one of the most successful consoles in gaming history has rolled out several notable exclusives, including <em data-start="248" data-end="266">Mario Kart World</em>, <em data-start="268" data-end="289">Donkey Kong Bananza</em>, <em data-start="291" data-end="309">Kirby Air Riders</em>, and and <em data-start="334" data-end="359">Metroid Prime 4: Beyond</em>. While that exclusive lineup is still growing, the real strength of the Switch 2 at launch is its backwards compatibility. The full eight-year library of original Nintendo Switch games can be played on the Switch 2.</p>
<p data-start="0" data-end="594">That’s a lot of games, but unfortunately, you’re Switch 2 won’t even be able to hold a small fraction of them on its internal storage alone.&nbsp;Fortunately, Nintendo has once again made storage expandable via microSD cards—though not just any card will do this time around.</p>
<p data-start="994" data-end="1336"><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5799/">Amazon is offering the Samsung P9 Express 512GB microSD card at 25% off.</a> Normally priced at $120, the discount brings it down to $80, saving you $40 for a limited time. Additionally, the 256GB option is down from $55 to just $40, saving you $15.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5799/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>
<p data-start="1338" data-end="1805">The Switch 2’s updated system architecture delivers improved performance and noticeably faster load times compared to its predecessor. However, that performance leap also means the console requires microSD Express cards to keep up with its faster data speeds. Older microSD cards that worked perfectly fine on the original Switch simply won’t meet the new standards. Express cards tend to cost more, which makes sales like this Samsung P9 deal hard to pass up.</p>
<h2>Triple Your Gaming Storage</h2>
<p data-start="1807" data-end="2237">Out of the box, the Nintendo Switch 2 comes with 256GB of internal storage. While that’s a massive improvement over the original Switch’s paltry 32GB, the usable space is slightly lower than what’s listed on the tin once system software is accounted for. On top of that, Switch 2 games are noticeably larger than last-generation titles. <em data-start="2114" data-end="2176">The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom – Switch 2 Edition</em>, for example, takes up more than 20GB on its own.</p>

<p data-start="2239" data-end="2635" data-is-last-node="" data-is-only-node="">Adding a 512GB Samsung P9 microSD Express effectively triples your total storage, giving you far more breathing room as new releases roll out over the coming years. With that kind of capacity, you won’t need to constantly juggle downloads or delete old favorites to make room for the next big Nintendo release. I’ve still got my fingers crossed for a new <em data-start="2624" data-end="2634">Star Fox</em>.</p>
<p data-start="2239" data-end="2635" data-is-last-node="" data-is-only-node=""><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5799/">Beyond the Nintendo Switch 2, the Samsung P9 microSD Express is also compatible with the original Switch, the Steam Deck, and Asus ROG Xbox Ally.</a> Also it’s not just for gaming. Photographers have been using these for ages too, so maybe you’re just looking to take more photos and videos on your Canon. The deal is just as good regardless of what you plan on using it for.</p>

              <p>Today’s annual Xbox Developer Direct goes live today at 1 p.m ET, during which the focus is expected to fall heavily on Playground Studios, developers of both <em>Fable</em> and&nbsp;<em>Forza Horizon 6</em>. Both are confirmed to be appearing at the show, alongside Game Freak’s non-<em>Pokémon</em> RPG&nbsp;<em>Beast of Reincarnation</em>, and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/forza-horizon-6-release-date-leak-corroborated">as&nbsp;<em>Eurogamer</em> reports</a>, it seems we now doubly know for sure one of the show’s intended surprises: <em>Forza Horizon</em>‘s release date. However, if any other games are to appear, Microsoft has achieved the unlikely and managed to keep it all under wraps.</p> <p>This isn’t the first time the May 19 release date for <em>FH6</em> has got out into the wild, although a second source certainly makes it seem all the more likely. <a href="https://kotaku.com/forza-horizon-6-leak-release-date-may-xbox-direct-2026-ps5-japan-2000659807">Last week a Saudi X account claimed to have seen an accidentally released trailer</a> for the Japan-set racing game which featured the release date of May 19. <em>Eurogamer</em> now adds that renowned leaker <a href="https://www.dealabs.com/magazine/forza-horizon-6-oui-une-version-physique-sera-bien-prevue-a-cette-date-et-a-ce-prix-on-vous-revele-les-details-du-lancement-60887">billbil-kun has authenticated the date</a>, alongside the blatantly obvious news that the game will release in Standard, Deluxe and Premium forms. Despite only being a few months away, we’ve seen almost nothing of the game beyond <a href="https://kotaku.com/forza-horizon-6-location-microsoft-tokyo-game-show-2000628658">a tease of Japanese mountains</a> and other culturally iconic artifacts. Microsoft is promising a “deep-dive” during the Direct, which will include “new features.”</p>

 <p>Microsoft also says the Developer Direct livestream will include a “first extended look at <em>Fable</em>,” the relaunching of the action-RPG franchise formerly developed by Lionhead Studios. Despite seemingly having been in some sort of development since perhaps as early as 2017, this will be the first time anything of depth will have been shown, following <a href="https://kotaku.com/fable-4-reboot-gameplay-trailer-xbox-summer-game-fest-1849051021">2023’s somewhat obfuscatory trailer</a> featuring Richard Ayoade. No word has leaked about whether we’ll be seeing a release date for the oft-slipping game.</p> <p>The final announced game is quite the coup for Microsoft (and Sony, it should be said), getting a Game Freak title away from Nintendo for the first time since 2017’s, er, <em>Giga Wrecker</em>. (No, me neither.) That eventually saw a Switch release, meaning the last time the&nbsp;<em>Pokémon</em> developer made a game that didn’t see a Nintendo version was 2015’s&nbsp;<em>Tempo the Badass Elephant</em>, and I think we can all agree: what? Before those two you have to go back to the 1990s. Anyway, action-RPG <em>Beast of Reincarnation</em> is due to come to PC, Xbox and PS5 (and&nbsp;<em>not</em> Switch) at some point in 2026, and today’s show will reveal “details of our protagonist Emma’s innovative plant manipulation actions and gameplay with her canine companion, Koo.”</p>

 <p>That’s all that’s confirmed, but I bet my right buttock that a fourth game will be snuck in there, even if it’s just a teasing glimpse (which you will <em>not</em> be getting of my right buttock.)</p> <p>You can catch the entire thing at 1 p.m. ET (10 a.m. PT) via Xbox’s <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hXn6bvU1Kh4">YouTube</a> and <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/Xbox">Twitch</a> channels, or just stare at the embed below for the next few hours.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/dji-mini-drone-combo-with-4k-camera-hits-its-first-low-of-the-year-now-cheaper-than-black-friday-2000661980</link>
            <guid>1412920</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>“The Drone Ban” sounds overly alarmist, but it’s real. The U.S. Federal Communications Commission has instituted a ban on new foreign-made drones and drone components. Which, considering the huge market dominance of Chinese brands, translates into a “buy them now while you can” situation for hobbyist drones. While this ban prevents any new models from being imported and sold in the U.S., ones that are already here are still available for purchase and use.</p>
<p>DJI is the undisputed U.S. market leader for drone hobbyists, and they’re a Chinese company that’s subject to the new FCC ban. Thankfully this doesn’t affect current DJI products already in the country, so <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6821/">Amazon’s number-one-selling hobbyist drone — the DJI Mini 4K — is available and at its lowest price in 30 days after a 21% price drop down to $309.</a> There won’t be any upgraded versions of the Mini coming, so it’s wise to grab this one while supplies last.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6821/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Beginner-Friendly Bundle</h2>
<p>The DJI Mini 4K Combo that’s on sale at Amazon is comprised of the top-selling, beginner-friendly Mini 4K, its remote controller, two DJI Mini 2 Intelligent Flight rechargeable batteries, a propeller holder, and shoulder bag. The two batteries combine for over an hour of flight time, more than enough to use the Mini 4K’s UHD camera to take incredible aerial still photos and 4K videos.</p>
<p>Most importantly, the Mini 4K is exceptionally beginner-friendly — easy to learn, easy to operate, and built with failsafe features like GPS Return to Home, which automatically brings it back to its point of origin if the signal is dropped or you just feel like you’re losing control of the drone. Most of the commands are one-touch, including takeoff and a soft landing that prevents crashes. The DJI Fly app (available for download at the official DJI website) is packed with learning resources that will have you sending the Mini 4K up to 4,000 meters high, with video transmission of up to 10 km for long-range flight and photography.</p>



<h2>Tiny and Tough</h2>
<p>The Mini 4K weighs just over 8 ounces, and the four propeller arms fold back into the main body to reduce it to a neat palm-sized package. Even with such a small and lightweight body, the Mini 4K’s four brushless motors are powerful enough to battle winds of up to 23 mph while in flight, a vast improvement over earlier hobbyist drones.</p>
<p>Is it possible that the Drone Ban will be lifted and new advanced models from DJI and other foreign manufacturers will again be allowed into the U.S.? Of course — nothing is less predictable than what comes out of Washington. But there’s an equal or better chance that the ban will stick, and it could take years for U.S. manufacturers to catch up to where DJI is now. Bottom line: The last legal foreign-made hobbyist drones are on our shores now, and the DJI Mini 4K is among the very best for beginners and more advanced flyers. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6821/">Take this Amazon limited-time deal and score yourself a terrific entry-level drone bundle for just $309.</a></p>
