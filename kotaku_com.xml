Still, if playing one of the greatest singer-songwriters ever forces Mescal to go through hours of training to learn how to sing some of the best songs from the 1960s like Timothée Chalamet did in preparation for the Bob Dylan biopic <em>A Complete Unknown</em>, then we can go a few more years without another Scott/Mescal movie. </p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

There are no respawns until the next round and between rounds, you buy guns and equipment with money you earn from kills and winning.</p><p> That probably sounds a lot like <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/dust-2-new-crate-boost-update-counter-strike-2-valve-1851602614?_gl=1*1luxzsp*_ga*NzE0NzM5NTc5LjE3Mjk4Njg5MzU.*_ga_V4QNJTT5L0*MTczMzk1MjM5NC45Ni4xLjE3MzM5NTQ2OTMuMTQuMC4w&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/dust-2-new-crate-boost-update-counter-strike-2-valve-1851602614?_gl=1*1luxzsp*_ga*NzE0NzM5NTc5LjE3Mjk4Njg5MzU.*_ga_V4QNJTT5L0*MTczMzk1MjM5NC45Ni4xLjE3MzM5NTQ2OTMuMTQuMC4w"><em>Counter-Strike</em></a></span><em>&nbsp;</em>and that’s because, yeah, <em>Ballistic </em>is basically <em>Fortnite</em>’s<em> </em>version of Valve’s popular FPS. </p><p>Before I played a few matches, I was curious how well FPS gameplay would work in <em>Fortnite</em>. After a few matches of <em>Ballistic</em>, I came away impressed. Epic has done the work to make animations and movement feel and look good in the first-person perspective. Sprinting, climbing, aiming down sights, reloading, and all that feels snappy and responsive, like you’d expect from a well-made first-person shooter. </p><p>I do have some quibbles with the controls. I really want a button that lets me swap between my rifle and pistol. I’d love to be able to map my grenade and gadgets to specific buttons, too, instead of using <em>Fortnite</em>’s default inventory and hotbar system. But these are minor issues that could be fixed in future updates. For now, what’s here is a solid FPS that just happens to live in <em>Fortnite </em>and uses all the character and weapon skins you already own. </p><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/dragon-ball-z-goku-fortnite-vegeta-anime-update-dbz-1849420484?_gl=1*14um7a4*_ga*MzQzNjkwNDM2LjE2NDY2NjQ1NzQ.*_ga_V4QNJTT5L0*MTczMzk0NzY1My4xMTQuMS4xNzMzOTQ3ODg5LjQyLjAuMA..&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/dragon-ball-z-goku-fortnite-vegeta-anime-update-dbz-1849420484?_gl=1*14um7a4*_ga*MzQzNjkwNDM2LjE2NDY2NjQ1NzQ.*_ga_V4QNJTT5L0*MTczMzk0NzY1My4xMTQuMS4xNzMzOTQ3ODg5LjQyLjAuMA..">Yes, that means Darth Vader can snipe Goku</a></span> while Leatherface helps Snoop Dogg plant the bomb at location A.

However, I experienced some issues with menus not loading properly, random sound effects happening for no reason, long waits between matches, and janky post-game victory screens. While I had a good time taking out <em>Fortnite </em>kiddies who have never played a game like <em>Counter-Strike</em>, I understand why Epic labeled this an “Early Access” experiment. It’s enjoyable, but far from finished or stable.</p><p>Still, even in this janky, early access form, Epic’s latest mode is a promising first step toward the developer adding more FPS modes and games into <em>Fortnite</em>. </p><p>Epic has also, with the launch of <em>Ballistic</em>, given the community the ability to start publicly uploading games using the company’s FPS tools.  I expect that in the coming days and weeks, we’ll see people recreating famous <em>Counter-Strike</em> maps and more. That sounds exciting, though if I was someone working on a first-person shooter that wasn’t <em>Call of Duty</em>, I’d be nervous. </p><p>If Epic can build upon <em>Ballistic </em>and add more modes, games, and options, it might be able to bring a whole new audience into its <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/gta-6-lego-fortnite-brick-life-roleplay-ps5-xbox-pc-1851716667&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/gta-6-lego-fortnite-brick-life-roleplay-ps5-xbox-pc-1851716667">ever-growing ecosystem</a></span>, and it might get even tougher than it already is to launch a multiplayer shooter. </p><p> .</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
