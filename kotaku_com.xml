              <p>This week is Prime Big Deals Day. Despite the name, it’s actually two days. On both October 7 and October 8, you can save huge swaths of cash on a bunch of cool tech or home goods, and that included PC gaming accessories. If you’ve been on the hunt for a new gaming monitor, <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4561/">now might be the time to pull the Hall Effect trigger you have mapped to “Add to Cart.” Samsung’s curved Odyssey G5 gaming monitor has dropped in price by $100.</a> The 27-inch model is down from $300 to $200, while the 32-inch has gone from $330 to $230.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4561/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Why Go Curved?</h2>
<p>The way we perceive the world around us is not on a flat plain. Heck, we even describe it as the world around us, not in front of us. So when we simulate worlds through the games we play, why not aim for a more immersive experience? Monitors like this are awesome to play pretty much anything on but where they really shine is anything that’s first-person. When I initially got my curved monitor, first thing I played was the updated version of <em>Portal </em>with RTX and oh boy was that thing a beaut.</p>
<p>The Samsung Odyssey G5 curved gaming monitor comes in either a moderate 27-inch or large 32-inch screen, each with a curvature of 1000R to help fill your peripheral vision with the visuals from your game. Enjoy a better-than-HD resolution of 1440p which packs in 1.7 times the pixel density of 1080p HD displays. HDR10 allows for vibrant colors with deep blacks and luminous whites, portray a wide depth of color and brightness.</p>



<p>The screen has a refresh rate of 165Hz to help maintain smooth gameplay with fast frame rates and the 1ms response time will keep your character feeling snappy. Seriously. I’d been playing <em>Hollow Knight: Silksong</em> through Game Pass and my Xbox on a TV from 2017 then switched over recently to my PC and a similarly-specced monitor and wow what a difference. Input lag I had thought was just normally going completely away. I felt like I was cheating. It was just like that episode of <em>Samurai Jack</em> when Jack is training with the rocks strapped to his wrists and ankles. You know the one I’m talking about.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4561/">Elevate your game and save yourself a solid $100 during Amazon’s Prim Big Deals Day with this Samsung Odyssey G5 curved gaming monitor,</a> currently going for an even $100 off during the sales event.</p>

              <p>It feels like&nbsp;<em>forever</em> since we had a big gaming rivalry. Since the dawn of&nbsp;<em>Call of Duty</em> it has gone through patches of directly competing with other big-name shooter franchises, whether they were <em>Medal of Honor</em>,&nbsp;<em>Halo</em> or&nbsp;<em>Battlefield</em>, with everyone obliged to take a side. It’s kind of nostalgic to see it happening again, with the announcement that&nbsp;<em>Call of Duty: Black Ops 7</em>‘s current beta is being extended by an extra 24 hours, to bring it close enough to&nbsp;<em>Battlefield 6</em>‘s release to creepily whisper in its ear.</p> <p>The current <em>CoDBlops 7&nbsp;</em>beta was due to come to an end at 12 p.m. EDT on Wednesday 8 October, but has now been given a 24 hour extension, along with a brand new map to play on and double XP rewarded until the new deadline of Thursday 9th. And you know this was planned from the start, designed to tread on <em>BF6</em>‘s heels as much as possible.</p>

 <figure id="attachment_2000632462" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000632462"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000632462">© Activision</figcaption></figure> <p>The sixth and final map is Toshin, the <a href="https://kotaku.com/xbox-tokyo-game-show-2025-ninja-gaiden-forza-2000628659">much vaunted Japanese setting</a> complete with cherry blossoms, a downtown shopping district, and a rather unfortunate central monorail crash. The update from the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.callofduty.com/patchnotes/2025/10/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-beta-patch-notes"><em>Call of Duty</em> patchnotes blog</a> also mentions that double XP&nbsp;<em>and</em> double weapon XP will be running through the end of the beta on Thursday, trying to keep as many eyes looking toward this franchise and not glancing away at EA’s rival.</p>

 <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/call-of-duty-cod-black-ops-blops7-beta-doors-ttk-2000632082">Reports from the beta so far</a> have suggested issues with mulitplayer matchmaking (which of course is one of the reasons these betas are run in the first place—to try to get on top of problems like this before the release), as well as grumbles about TTK and oddly enough, the game’s closing doors.</p>

 <p>Come the end of the beta, attention returns to&nbsp;<em>Blops 6</em> and season 6’s The Haunting event for Halloween from October 9, which also happens to be the day&nbsp;<em>Battlefield 6</em> comes out. At that point, FPS fans’ attentions will be torn, <a href="https://kotaku.com/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-bad-bf6-battlefield-6-hype-trailer-2000618912">but many will be tempted by the shiny new object</a>.</p> <p><em>Battlefield 6</em> then has more than a month to itself, with <em>Black Ops 7 </em>not out until November 14 and not planning any more betas before then. It’ll be interesting to see if that’s long enough for <em>BF6</em> players to have had their fill and be willing to move across, or if both games can maintain their own audiences in the holiday season. Certainly Activision and EA are <a href="https://kotaku.com/battlefield-6-two-new-maps-modes-roadmap-free-updates-dlc-2025-ea-2000630301">both planning</a> an awful lot of post-game content to try to keep everyone’s attention, and I’m looking forward to sitting back with popcorn to watch it all play out.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/anker-65w-3-port-charger-is-down-to-pennies-amazon%E2%80%99s-nearly-giving-away-the-last-units.1318345/</guid>

              <p>Multi-device charging becomes a daily headache when you’re constantly swapping cables and hunting for available outlets. You need one charger that can handle your laptop, phone and tablet without compromising speed or taking up half your desk. <strong>Anker’s 65W Charger solves this with three ports (USB-C and USB-A)</strong> in a package roughly the size of an AirPods Pro case. These chargers haven’t seen meaningful discounts in months with the last comparable pricing showing up during July’s… Prime Day. Amazon’s <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4567/">bringing that record low price back for Prime members right now, dropping it from $39 to $25</a> for this Prime Big Deal Day event.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4567/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>GaN II Technology Redefines the Charging Game</h2>
<p>The Nano II Anker charger employs GaN II technology and it is <strong>running twice as fast as a typical silicon-based charger</strong>. That elevated speed creates smaller internal component sizes for the same output, hence how Anker managed to pack a whopping 65W into a tiny form factor.</p>
<p>With three devices plugged in simultaneously, the <strong>charger dynamically divides power across ports based on what’s plugged in</strong>. The dividing of power is by way of PPS protocols which speak to your devices to deliver only the wattage each is capable of receiving. If we say a MacBook Air, an iPhone, and an iPad are plugged in simultaneously, for example, the charger might deliver 45 watts to the laptop, 15 watts to the iPad, and 5 watts to the phone.</p>



<p>The three-port configuration includes <strong>a pair of USB-C ports and a USB-A port</strong>. The USB-C configuration for two ports is good for newer phones, tablets, and laptops, which have embraced USB-C but older devices like wireless headphones, fitness monitors, or Kindle readers, which are yet to conform, are dealt with by the USB-A port.</p>
<p>Also, GaN II technology <strong>enhances heat management</strong> better than traditional charger designs. The new circuit board architecture and stacked component arrangement allow for better heat dissipation, enabling the charger to remain cooler even for longer periods of use. It will warm up during high-charge sessions which is typical but it should not become unbearably hot, causing concern about leaving it on a charger for an entire night.</p>
<p>At $25, it’s costing about $8.33 per port for a charger that will do everything from our phones to our laptops. If we contrast it to getting individual chargers for each piece of equipment, we see how valuable it is. That it’s available at a price equal to July’s Prime Day’s cheapest, despite its absence of discounts for several months, makes it a good buy now.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/meta-is-upset-amazon-has-dropped-the-meta-quest-3s-128-gb-price-for-the-third-time-2000632430</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/meta-is-upset-amazon-has-dropped-the-meta%E2%80%AFquest%E2%80%AF3s%E2%80%AF128%E2%80%AFgb-price-for-the-third-time.1318339/</guid>

              <p>Getting into virtual reality has always meant making a tough choice: <strong>spend big on premium hardware or skip it entirely</strong>. Meta designed the Quest 3S to fix that problem, creating an entry point into mixed reality that doesn’t require a second mortgage. The catch? Meta rarely discounts their hardware. Instead of price cuts, they’ve traditionally thrown in free games or extended their Meta Horizon+ subscription for a few months. Actual savings on the headset itself simply didn’t happen.</p>
<p>Amazon’s Prime Big Deal Day is changing that pattern for the first time ever,<a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4500/"> dropping the 128GB Quest 3S with the Gorilla Tag Cardboard Hero Bundle from $299 to $249</a>. If you’ve been thinking about early holiday shopping or surprising someone with their first VR experience, this timing couldn’t be better.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4500/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>
<h2>Price Matters for Newcomers to Mixed Reality</h2>
<p>The Quest 3S is <strong>Meta’s most accessible path into current-generation mixed reality technology</strong>. At $249, you’re getting hardware that shares the same core processor as the more expensive Quest 3, the Snapdragon XR2 Gen 2 chip. This processor handles the demanding computational work of tracking your environment, rendering games at smooth frame rates, and blending virtual objects into your real-world surroundings.</p>
<p>Mixed reality overlays virtual information onto your own reality by way of passthrough cameras: You may play games where virtual entities speak to your furniture, construct virtual desks with multiple floating monitors all around your own workspace or work out and yet see your living room. This integration of worlds holds you <strong>anchored to your own space rather than isolating you from reality</strong>.</p>

<p>The headset runs at a whopping 1<strong>832 x 1920 pixels per eye at a 90Hz refresh rate</strong>. That type of resolution produces clear images for reading text within virtual worlds and perusing environmental objects within games. A 90Hz refresh rate also reduces motion blur during abrupt head movements, precluding motion sickness that plagued other VR headsets at lower refresh rates.</p>
<p>Installation is easy and <span><strong>cableless</strong></span>: The Quest 3S is a self-contained headset, so all of your processing occurs within the headset itself, eliminating your need for a gaming PC. You charge it through USB-C, mark your play space boundary with controllers, and are playing within a few minutes. <strong>Batter life averages two to three hours</strong> depending on your activity.</p>



<p>The 128GB of storage holds space for some 10 to 15 large games, depending on how large they are themselves. The physics-based <strong>multiplayer game Gorilla Tag, a game included here in this Amazon-only bundle</strong>, is incredibly popular among VR groups because after a little while of getting used to swinging your arms to build up speed, your movements end up feeling really intuitive. Themed cosmetic items for the game are included here as part of the Cardboard Hero bundle which means you can set your character before even getting going directly.</p>
<p>In addition to Gorilla Tag, y<strong>ou receive a three-month trial of Meta Horizon+</strong>, which grants access to more than 30 games through a rotating library. Games like Walkabout Mini Golf, Demeo, and Pistol Whip are offered, which allow for a change of pace directly without purchasing titles individually. New titles are released each month, so each month you have a new set of genres ranging from rhythm games through puzzle adventures to try out.</p>
<p>With games included at $249, Meta’s finally giving a real hardware discount on hardware actually delivering on promises of affordable mixed reality.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/seagate-4tb-xbox-expansion-card-falls-to-all-time-low-a-rare-deal-that%E2%80%99s-better-value-than-2tb-for-prime-day.1318285/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Having all your games in one place is not as impossible as it might seem. But with modern games pushing 100GB or more, the built-in storage on the Xbox Series X or S just doesn’t go far. The easiest way to boost your storage capacity is by getting your hands on a dedicated expansion card like this one from Seagate.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4557/">The massive 4TB version is now 24% off on Amazon, bringing the price down to $380</a>. It’s the largest officially licensed Xbox expansion card available on the market, but the deal might not be around for too long. We recommend acting fast to grab yourself one while it’s still live.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4557/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Enough Capacity for All Your Favorite Titles</h2>
<p>This expansion card is built in partnership with Xbox, so you can expect it to match the performance of your console’s internal SSD. Xbox Velocity Architecture support makes for fast load times and sharp graphics without any slowdowns. You can also play the games directly from the card without needing to transfer files back and forth. Simply insert it into the expansion slot on the back of your Xbox Series X or S, and it’s ready to go – literally within minutes.</p>
<p>The 4TB storage capacity is enough to house all your treasured titles across four generations of Xbox consoles. So, whether you’re after the latest releases or still can’t part ways with your Xbox 360 favorites, this card has enough room to keep everything in one place. Quick Resume support lets you jump between several games without losing your progress, both from the internal SSD and the expansion card. The switch is quick and will be especially appreciated by players who rotate between different games. You could be playing as a single player one minute, and then jumping into action with your friends the next!</p>



<p>Next-gen features are also taken care of. Plus, you’re getting a 3-year limited warranty with your purchase for some extra peace of mind. Should there be any issues down the line, you’re covered.</p>
<p>Altogether, this card does not just offer extra storage for your games. It also keeps up with the performance of your console. It’s designed around the Xbox Velocity Architecture, so speeds and output is going to be the same as what you get from your internal SSD. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4557/">It’s now down to $380, which is a $120 discount on the retail price of $500. If 4TB is too much space for you, consider going for the 1TB or 2TB version.</a></p>
