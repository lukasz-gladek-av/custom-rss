After careful consideration, we are closing three of our development studios – Monolith Productions, Player First Games and Warner Bros. Games San Diego. This is a strategic change in direction and not a reflection of these teams or the talent that consists within them. </p></blockquote><blockquote data-type="BlockQuote"><p>The development of Monolith’s Wonder Woman videogame will not move forward. Our hope was to give players and fans the highest quality experience possible for the iconic character, and unfortunately this is no longer possible within our strategic priorities.  This is another tough decision, as we recognize Monolith’s storied history of delivering epic fan experiences through amazing games. We greatly admire the passion of the three teams and thank every employee for their contributions. As difficult as today is, we remain focused on and excited about getting back to producing high-quality games for our passionate fans and developed by our world class studios and getting our Games business back to profitability and growth in 2025 and beyond.</p></blockquote><p>In addition to Monolith, the publisher is also closing Player First Games, the team behind<em> MultiVersus</em>, and WB San Diego.

One of the channel’s most popular shows was <em>MTV Unplugged.</em> This was a live concert series that brought in different artists and bands and had them play their music using a minimal amount of instruments and tech. And now <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/star-trek-section-31-cameo-big-name-jamie-lee-curtis-1851747475&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/star-trek-section-31-cameo-big-name-jamie-lee-curtis-1851747475">Paramount+</a></span> has added a ton of <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.paramountplus.com/shows/mtv-unplugged/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.paramountplus.com/shows/mtv-unplugged/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">classic<em> MTV Unplugged</em> episodes</a></span>, including famous performances by Nirvana and Alice in Chains. </p><p>As noted in a press release by Paramount, many of these <em>Unplugged </em>episodes “haven’t been available in 20+ years.” Sure, you could find some of the most famous ones on YouTube in various levels of quality, but most were much trickier to find and the versions floating around online looked and sounded terrible. So it’s really nice to have a large chunk of music history accessible again. Well, accessible if you have Paramount+. I have the service because I love<em> Star Trek </em>and <em>Survivor</em>, and I rewatch <em>Frasier</em>. If you ask nicely I’ll share my account with you. <br></p><p>One of the <em>Unplugged </em>episodes added to Paramount+ features the infamous 1996 performance by Oasis. That episode almost didn’t happed because days before the event, Liam Gallagher <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.musicradar.com/news/even-before-we-got-to-the-day-of-the-show-there-was-a-concern-a-concern-with-liam-the-story-behind-the-farce-and-the-glory-of-oasiss-infamous-1996-mtv-unplugged-performance#&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.musicradar.com/news/even-before-we-got-to-the-day-of-the-show-there-was-a-concern-a-concern-with-liam-the-story-behind-the-farce-and-the-glory-of-oasiss-infamous-1996-mtv-unplugged-performance#" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">reportedly complained of a sore throat</a></span>. And when the band finally showed up an hour before taping, he was apparently very drunk. Noel Gallagher, his brother, ended up singing the entire show on his own. This episode existed in some low-quality forms online already, but now you can watch a pristine version of this famous concert that almost wasn’t. </p><p>Beyond Unplugged, Paramount+ has also added a ton of <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VH1_Storytellers&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VH1_Storytellers" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>VH1 Storytellers</em></a></span> episodes, too. This was a similar show to <em>Unplugged</em>, but even more stripped down and with the artists talking more about their lives or the origins of their songs in between numbers.</p><p>Now, excuse me, I’m going to listen to Nirvana’s performance of <em>The Man Who Sold The World</em> again. </p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
