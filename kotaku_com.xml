Hype levels are starting to run dangerously low.

They might finally be in luck. According to reliable leaker NatetheHate, a new Nintendo Direct is coming before the end of July. </p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="197565" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="Nintendo Switch 2 Could Launch With Almost No Reviews" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="122" data-playlist="197565,197567,197533" data-current="197565"><div><p>Nintendo Switch 2 Could Launch With Almost No Reviews</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197565/197565_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197565/197565_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197565/197565_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/23089.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>“From what I have been told, there is a direct this month,” the YouTube podcaster, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/switch-2-announcement-nintendo-console-rumor-date-1851738104&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/switch-2-announcement-nintendo-console-rumor-date-1851738104">who correctly reported</a></span> the timeframe for the Switch 2's original showcase, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYkD9QCBp4Y&amp;t=1920s&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYkD9QCBp4Y&amp;t=1920s" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">said on his latest episode</a></span>. “So, the month of July, but that Direct will not take place until after <em>Donkey Kong Bonanza </em>releases.” That game comes out July 17, and with Nintendo often opting for showcases in the middle of the week, we’re left with likely dates of July 22-24 and 29-31. </p><p>“Beyond beyond that, I have no additional information. I do not have information as to the exact timing at this point,” NatetheHate continued. “If I had to speculate, I would say probably the last week of July because Friday of that week is August 1st which is Nintendo’s earning report day. So, I could see them having a Direct that week leading to that investors’ report.”</p><p>Elsewhere in the episode, the leaker dives into all the reasons fans are getting impatient for the next Switch 2 showcase. Nintendo has a big first-party fall lineup, but not much of it is Switch 2 exclusive at the moment. We still need dates for <em>Metroid Prime 4</em> (cross-gen) and <em>Kirby Air Riders </em>(Switch 2 only). All of the big third-party ports like <em>Borderlands 4</em>, <em>Elden Ring</em>, and <em>Final Fantasy VII Remake </em>are slated for 2025 but haven’t been nailed down either. </p><p>According to NatetheHate,<em> Red Dead Redemption 2</em> is definitely coming to the Switch 2, but it’s unclear if that would get announced in a Nintendo Direct or via a standalone trailer by Rockstar Games. There’s also been a surprising lack of support from Microsoft so far. <em>Gears of War: Reloaded </em>is seemingly feasible on the new hardware, but is currently only announced for PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X/S. <em>Helldivers 2</em> is also getting ported to Xbox. While a stretch, that would probably be the biggest Switch 2 surprise of all if it somehow became a reality.</p><p>There’s also the mysterious absence of <em>Call of Duty</em>. Microsoft made promises to bring the franchise back to Nintendo platforms as part of its Activision acquisition, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/will-call-of-duty-black-ops-7-come-to-switch-2-1851784023&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/will-call-of-duty-black-ops-7-come-to-switch-2-1851784023">and the latter confirmed</a></span> that both sides were working on something that would be announced in the future. Does that start this year with <em>Call of Duty: Black Ops 7</em>, or in 2026 with the next sequel? Nintendo was reportedly being very precious with Switch 2 devkits during development, so it’s hard to have a good sense of who may have projects in the pipeline already and who is playing catchup. </p><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/switch-2-3d-mario-odyssey-donkey-kong-bananza-director-1851785403?_gl=1*1l973qf*_ga*MTg4NjY0MzM1NS4xNzM5NDU1MDcz*_ga_V4QNJTT5L0*czE3NTI1MDMwMzgkbzc5JGcxJHQxNzUyNTA2ODE2JGo2MCRsMCRoMA..&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/switch-2-3d-mario-odyssey-donkey-kong-bananza-director-1851785403?_gl=1*1l973qf*_ga*MTg4NjY0MzM1NS4xNzM5NDU1MDcz*_ga_V4QNJTT5L0*czE3NTI1MDMwMzgkbzc5JGcxJHQxNzUyNTA2ODE2JGo2MCRsMCRoMA..">Finally, there’s the question of Mario</a></span>.

It feels like we’re running out of time (and room) for the next one to arrive this fall, but the 2026 spring window could be a decent bet. Nintendo rarely teases things that are more than a year away at this point, but I’m hoping they make an exception in this case. They’ll want to have the next<em> Mario </em>ready for the next <em>Super Mario Bros.</em> movie anyway, and <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/donkey-kong-movie-nintendo-bananza-super-mario-bros-1851786191&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/donkey-kong-movie-nintendo-bananza-super-mario-bros-1851786191">that’s coming in April</a></span>. </p><p>.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://kotaku.com/switch-2-nintendo-direct-july-mario-red-dead-2-1851786219]]></content:encoded>

Thank you to the community for bringing this to our attention, and we’ll be removing that from the environment art in the next update.”</p><p>This prompted a lot of replies from fans asking Iron Galaxy to leave it in, as they didn’t believe it was a joke about Neversoft, but instead a joke about Activision. </p><p><em>Kotaku </em>has contacted Iron Galaxy and Activision for comment. </p><p>When I spotted this box on Waterpark, I assumed it was Iron Galaxy making a joke about how Neversoft, the creators of the <em>Tony Hawk’s Pro Skater </em>series, were forced off the skateboarding franchise around 2005 and <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://web.archive.org/web/20100216142213/http://www.bingegamer.net/2010/rumor-layoffs-loss-of-guitar-hero-at-neversoft/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20100216142213/http://www.bingegamer.net/2010/rumor-layoffs-loss-of-guitar-hero-at-neversoft/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">had to develop new <em>Guitar Hero</em> games instead</a></span>. That sounds a lot like how Activision operates in 2025, shoving all of its teams onto its current big cash cow, <em>Call of Duty</em>, and not letting them make their own stuff. Eventually, <em>Guitar Hero</em> sales tanked, and Neversoft was closed in 2014, with its remaining staff shoved into the <em>CoD </em>mines. A sad and frustrating end for a great studio.

The truth is likely far less nefarious than a right-wing grifter would have you believe: when the world has reached comic book levels of evil, comic book stories about heroes doing genuine good <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.vulture.com/article/review-james-gunns-superman-cant-help-but-be-political.html&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.vulture.com/article/review-james-gunns-superman-cant-help-but-be-political.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">start to feel a little too pointed and relevant</a></span> for people who think the dystopian hellscape we live in is the world functioning as intended.</p><p>Unlike the <em>Man of Steel </em>iteration of Clark Kent, <em>Superman </em>leans into a hopeful vision of its hero. This guy wants to save everyone he can, and the movie makes a point of showing him going to great lengths to protect the people and animals of Earth. One of the standout moments in the movie is when Clark, in the midst of a much bigger battle, saves a small squirrel. Superman doesn’t trade lives. Everyone is worth saving, whether they’re a person or a little rodent. He initially does this because a damaged message from his parents, recorded before they sent him from his doomed home planet of Krypton, seemed to instruct him to be humanity’s protector. But once the message was repaired, it’s revealed that, in this version of events, Clark was sent to the planet to rule over it like a dictator. Nevertheless, he makes his own decision to commit to the mission he started: to be humanity’s protector. But he’s not “of this world,” so Lex Luthor and his ilk conspire against our hero and use propaganda to try and turn the public on him. That’s pretty much the immigrant experience in America.</p><p>The core conflict of <em>Superman </em>is refreshingly simple. Clark cannot fathom how geopolitics could be more important to <em>anyone</em> than saving the lives of innocent people. An early interview between him and Lois Lane escalates because she repeatedly pokes at him for not saving people “the right” way. This principle extends to him stopping the country of Boravia from invading its neighbor, Jarhanpur. Though these places are fictional, the parallels between these events and the real-world conflict between Israel and Palestine aren’t subtle. Some debate whether or not this was actually Gunn’s intention or if it’s merely happenstance that the film’s geopolitical conflict mirrors a real one, but that hasn’t stopped people from taking this to mean the movie is pro-Palestine or, more specifically, anti-Israel.</p><p>As <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://comicbookclublive.com/2025/07/13/is-superman-about-the-israeli-palestinian-conflict/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://comicbookclublive.com/2025/07/13/is-superman-about-the-israeli-palestinian-conflict/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">some critics have pointed out</a></span>, <em>Superman </em>could very well be about Palestine, but it could also be about Ukraine. The truth is the film’s fictional framing is non-descript enough that it can be interpreted as being about many things. My cynical read is that it could give DC some plausible deniability to talk about these kinds of conflicts without having to make a big public statement, but whatever the authorial intent is, the fact that viewers are coming away from it wholeheartedly believing that it is “political” speaks to the truth of its story. It’s emboldening to those who want the world to be better, and uncomfortable for those who think things are just fine as they are. Lex Luthor is willing to spread lies, put people in danger, and even kill innocent people to maintain his power. Superman, having been on the receiving end of a torrent of abuse and distrust, still wants to believe in people, rather than falling into cynical detachment. When Lois asks how he can still think everyone he meets is “beautiful” after everything he’s been through, Clark says believing in people, even after you’ve been let down, is “punk rock.” If that’s “too political” for you, then that sounds like a you problem. </p></div></div><br/><br/>https://kotaku.com/superman-israel-palestine-woke-clark-kent-punk-rock-1851786212]]></content:encoded>
