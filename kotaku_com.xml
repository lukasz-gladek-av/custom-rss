I can’t really say for myself yet. To be honest, I haven’t really done much in Nintendo’s latest open-world reimagining of its iconic ape’s adventures. It’s not because I don’t want to, but because I, like several others, have found <em>Bananza </em>difficult to get through. This isn’t because of a difficult boss fight or tough platforming challenge, but because this game feels like the most expensive fidget toy I’ve ever held in my hands. The coolest thing about <em>Donkey Kong Bananza </em>is also what makes it a pain in the ass: I’m talking about the destructible environment.</p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="196470" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="The Week In Games: Reignited Rivalries And More New Releases" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="123" data-playlist="196470,197589,197586" data-current="196470"><div><p>The Week In Games: Reignited Rivalries And More New Releases</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196470/196470_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196470/196470_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196470/196470_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196470/196470_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/22020.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>When I first booted up <em>Bananza</em>, I spent over an hour in the first room. No, not the first area, but the first <em>room</em> that Donkey Kong spawns into when you start a new playthrough. What was I doing in a mostly barren cave? I was beating the absolute shit out of the ceiling, floor, and walls in search of hidden packets of gold buried in the stone. And <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.polygon.com/culture/613994/donkey-kong-bananza-destruction-mechanics-switch-2-opening-level&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.polygon.com/culture/613994/donkey-kong-bananza-destruction-mechanics-switch-2-opening-level" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">I’m not the only player</a></span> who has been captivated (perhaps unwillingly) by the act of giving the environment the ol’ one-two.</p><p>Nintendo made a big deal about how <em>Bananza</em>’s cave structures could be pounded into submission, potentially revealing new areas or treasures waiting for you on the other side. In this game, DK is effectively a miner in search of golden bananas, and it’s genuinely impressive just how thoroughly he’s able to excavate the world. It’s incredibly satisfying to just be able to pull a Stanley Yelnats and plunge into the ground below you whenever you feel so compelled. I can rip a stone off a cave wall and start slapping enemies around with it. DK climbs up walls and can tunnel through the ceiling like it’s nothing. Caves are often meant to feel restrictive in video games, but <em>Bananza</em> makes Donkey Kong a walking drill capable of making tunnel systems at the press of a button. It’s a <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/donkey-kong-bananza-dk-switch-2-60fps-30fps-nintendo-1851786303&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/donkey-kong-bananza-dk-switch-2-60fps-30fps-nintendo-1851786303">pretty impressive technical feat</a></span> on top of being a satisfying design space to play around in. But the problem is, being able to tear up the ground underneath you and find a bunch of shiny shit scratches my brain a little <em>too</em> well.</p><figure id="" data-id="2bed8ff5a6e652cb1e8bf9ac3a7c3288" data-recommend-id="image://2bed8ff5a6e652cb1e8bf9ac3a7c3288" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Donkey Kong looking annoyed at gold nuggets." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Donkey Kong looking annoyed at gold nuggets." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Nintendo / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="2bed8ff5a6e652cb1e8bf9ac3a7c3288" data-recommend-id="image://2bed8ff5a6e652cb1e8bf9ac3a7c3288" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Donkey Kong looking annoyed at gold nuggets." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>I was diagnosed with OCD last year, and while it’s not the stereotypical clean freak shit you often see depicted in media, it did give me context for some of my odder neurodivergent tendencies. As far as my gaming habits go, however, this was somewhat surprising to me because I’m not usually the completionist type who has to do every little side quest or task, and I generally don’t like games that feel like they’re wasting my time. <em>Bananza</em>, however, has found a way past that mental block and tapped into a more easily activated tendency by giving me a small taste of destruction that inevitably turns into me devouring a meal of demolition.</p><p>Walking through the environment in <em>Bananza</em> is like bee-bopping around in a minefield until I find a stray nugget of gold poking out of a wall. I punch the shiny rock out of the wall, but the wall keeps caving in with every subsequent punch, and every few swings, another piece of gold comes tumbling out of the rubble. Sometimes an entire geyser of gold erupts from the stone, and I can’t simply leave to go to the next area when there could be another one of those waiting for me inside a stalagmite I have yet to pummel. Then, by the time I’ve really gotten into the rhythm of digging around, I realize that I’ve left a lot of destruction in my wake and have lost an hour or so of my day and accomplished nothing.</p><figure id="" data-id="530829a019bb0f00e3a6552ad2304953" data-recommend-id="image://530829a019bb0f00e3a6552ad2304953" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Donkey Kong smiles in a barren cave after he rocked its shit." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Donkey Kong smiles in a barren cave after he rocked its shit." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Nintendo / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="530829a019bb0f00e3a6552ad2304953" data-recommend-id="image://530829a019bb0f00e3a6552ad2304953" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Donkey Kong smiles in a barren cave after he rocked its shit." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>I have always considered myself firmly a “goal-oriented” player, and that means I tend to like linear games more than the open-world glut of a lot of modern AAA projects. I get agitated when I feel like I’m not doing something and making real progress, and that discomfort with idle time means I’m usually the type of person who will do a few side quests, but hold off on a lot of the extracurricular stuff until I’ve seen the main quest through. In most video games, these alternate activities are sequestered enough down different pathways that I can keep my mind on my primary goal and come back to them later. With <em>Donkey Kong Bananza</em>, however, the alternate path is underneath my feet with every step. Everything I do chips away at the walls of the cave system, and every inch I break through might lead me to treasure, or at least make a really satisfying crushing sound. I’ll see the end eventually, but y’all go ahead. I’ll catch up after I’ve left no stone unturned.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://kotaku.com/donkey-kong-bananza-destructible-environments-ocd-1851786630]]></content:encoded>

Except, for reasons never announced, that’s not happened—we’re experiencing our first four-year gap in the franchise in ages. (God, I <em>hope</em> it’s just four years.) And while <em>Z-A</em> is looking intriguing, and we’ll definitely get a good look at it again tomorrow, one thing it isn’t going to do is add any new Pokémon to the roster.</p><p>So could this Presents be hiding some sort of tease for Gen X? I wish I could believe that, but I have my doubts. If there is going to be a new mainline game next year, all of history suggests it won’t be until around October, and starting reveals over a year early seems unlikely. Still, it’d be good!</p><p>What’s more likely is we’ll get updates for the array of <em>Pokémon</em> games already out there, including <em>Unite</em>, <em>TCG Pocket</em>, <em>Sleep</em> and the rest, as well as reveals for perhaps a couple of new mobile apps and games, and maybe a new multiplayer game. Oh, and something about <em>Horizons</em> season 2, perhaps. Perhaps more on the new season of the wonderful stop-motion <em>Concierge.</em>&nbsp;</p><p>The stream will start tomorrow, July 22, at 9 a.m. EDT, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.youtube.com/pokemon&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.youtube.com/pokemon" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">via the official YouTube channel</a></span>. And intriguingly, if you tune into the Japanese channel an hour earlier, there’s apparently going to be an hour of DJ Pikachu Live? I have no idea. But it could well be promoting a surprise reveal of a DJ-based game in the main event.</p><p>.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://kotaku.com/pokemon-presents-legend-z-a-youtube-dj-pikachu-1851786626]]></content:encoded>

Here are the five biggest takeaways from the annual fan extravaganza. </p><h2 id="h260190"><a id=""></a>Unannounced fall 2025 update will finally explain <em>Warframe</em>’s convoluted mod process to new players</h2><figure id="" data-id="3c4a6e9f04dc9b517f81e72144eddf53" data-recommend-id="image://3c4a6e9f04dc9b517f81e72144eddf53" data-format="png" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Warframes appear in art for the fall season.

" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p><em>Warframe</em>, like <em>Destiny</em>, is practically ancient by modern live-service gaming standards now, and it has acquired a number of systems that have become second nature to ongoing players but inscrutable to newcomers. One of those is the mod system, which features a lot of customization and crafting. </p><p>While Digital Extremes hasn’t dished on what its big fall update will include (more info is coming in a devstream on September 25), we do know it will have a new quest called Teacher that will onboard players to the game’s most important buildcrafting tool. Hopefully it’s a good onramp for everyone still looking for one. </p><h2 id="h260191"><a id=""></a>The next story chapter is called<em> The Old Peace</em></h2><p><em>Warframe</em>’s next expansion drops near the end of 2025 and will take players into the past to witness the game’s “most tectonic historical event,” known as “The Old War.” It’ll feature a visual overhaul to player controlled Tenno Operators and WWI-inspired trench warfare. </p><p>It’ll include a playable Excalibur Prime for one of the quests, Caliban Prime, new Sentient allies and enemies, the devil-inspired Warframe Uriel, and two new Protoframes. Most importantly, it’ll set the stage for something the game has never done before.</p><h2 id="h260192"><a id=""></a>2026 will takes players to the distant Tau star system</h2><p>Following the events of <em>The Old Peace</em>, players will, for the first time in Warframe’s history, be taken to the new Tau star system. It was a target for colonization within the game’s fiction long ago, with self-replicating terraforming machines called Sentients tasked with preparing Tau for inhabitation. What will await players there next year is anybody’s guess. </p><h2 id="h260193"><a id=""></a><em>Soulframe</em> is still years away but fans went hands-on with an early test build called <em>Preludes</em></h2><p>In addition to continuing <em>Warframe</em>’s legacy, Digital Extremes has also been busy with the fantasy-based spin-off <em>Soulframe</em>. An extended demo during TennoCon 2025 showed character customization and a player tracking a monster through the woods, using a combination of melee weapons, archer, and spells to survive various woodland threats. While fans were able to try out the pre-alpha <em>Preludes</em> build over the weekend, a lasting free demo sounds a bit farther away. </p><p>Will the game be ready before the end of 2025? That’s sounding less and less likely.  “It’s an aspirational goal,” community manager Sarah Asselin told fans during a Q&amp;A <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.eurogamer.net/soulframe-alpha-prelude-access-2025-delay-2026&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/soulframe-alpha-prelude-access-2025-delay-2026" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">over the weekend</a></span>. “We’re looking at where we’re at by the end of the year, but we want to feel confident that we’ve built<em> Soulframe</em> out to the point where it feels good to do so, for the players and the developers.” </p><h2 id="h260194"><a id=""></a><em>Warframe</em>’s devs would love to make a Switch 2 version but still haven’t received a dev kit from Nintendo</h2><figure id="" data-id="eaf5981b80d6f1aaf29bba3e598ac81e" data-recommend-id="image://eaf5981b80d6f1aaf29bba3e598ac81e" data-format="png" data-width="1186" data-height="669" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Warframe characters appear on a Switch 2.
