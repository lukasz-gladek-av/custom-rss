              <p>Earbuds are great, but they don’t compare to the sound quality achievable with a pair of headphones. You can even get a pretty solid pair for not much cash. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5054/">Right now, Amazon has the Beats Solo 4 on-ear Bluetooth headphones on sale for 35% off.</a> That ends up bringing the price down by $70. The headphones start at $200, so that brings the price down to just $130. This is the lowest price we’ve seen for the Beats Solo 4 since the summer.</p>
<p>Now, even though these on-ear headphones can produce pretty stellar sound, do note that they do not support active noise cancellation or transparency mode like some of the premium model Beats do. The option of turning on noise cancelling is super practical and can be great to have, but its one of those features that can really jack up the price of a pair of headphones. So you end up getting high-quality audio at a fraction of the price by going without ANC. If that’s a deal breaker for you though, check out the Beats Studio Pro instead.</p>

<h2>All-Day Listening</h2>
<p>With the Beats Solo 4, you can expect to get a full 50 hours of playtime off on just a single charge. That’s more than two days of non-stop listening if you really wanted to. Then when they finally do die down to zero percent, they can charge up super quickly. Say you’re about to head out for the day and realize you forgot to plug them in overnight. Not a problem. The Beats Solo 4 support fast fuel charging which can bring your battery up from dead to five full hours of listening time after charging the set for just 10 minutes.</p>
<p>That long battery life wouldn’t do you any good if the headphones weren’t comfortable to wear. Well, the Beats Solo 4 have an ultralight yet durable construction which means you can keep them on throughout the entire day without them weighing down your noggin. Plus, the flex-grip headband with adjustable angled ear cup and plush ear cushions help to ensure they stay snuggly fit and comfy for all sizes and shapes of heads.</p>



<p>Connecting to your Beats Solo 4 is easy whether you have an iPhone or an Android. The headphones support touch to pair functionality with is exactly what it sounds like. Just touch you phone to your headphones and you’ll immediately be able to listen to your favorite music, audiobooks, or podcasts.</p>
<p>Choose between five different color options which include matte black, black gold, cloud pink, metallic pink, or slate blue. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5054/">All colorways are on sale for $70 off for a limited time.</a></p>
