And thanks to the Booster Course Pass DLC, that library of older tracks only grew bigger. Many of<em> MK8 Deluxe Edition</em>’s new tracks were pulled directly from <em>Mario Kart Tour,</em> a 2019 mobile version of Nintendo’s popular racing series. But for some reason, Piranha Plant Pipeline never made the leap to Switch. It also isn’t included in <em>Mario Kart World </em>on Switch 2. And because <em>Mario Kart Tour</em> rotates tracks in and out, actually <em>playing </em>Piranha Plant Pipeline is tricky. But the track is back and playable for the next few days.</p><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.ign.com/articles/what-may-be-mario-karts-rarest-track-is-available-to-play-now-for-a-limited-time-as-part-of-smartphone-spin-off-mario-kart-tour&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/what-may-be-mario-karts-rarest-track-is-available-to-play-now-for-a-limited-time-as-part-of-smartphone-spin-off-mario-kart-tour" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">As spotted by <em>IGN</em>,</a></span> on July 9, Nintendo announced that the <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.mariowiki.com/Piranha_Plant_Pipeline&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.mariowiki.com/Piranha_Plant_Pipeline" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Piranha Plant Pipeline</a></span> track was available again in <em>Mario Kart Tour.</em> The track will be playable as part of the Pipe Tour, which goes from today until July 22. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/07/mario-kart-tour-grants-access-to-a-track-unplayable-anywhere-else&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/07/mario-kart-tour-grants-access-to-a-track-unplayable-anywhere-else" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">This is reportedly</a></span> only the third time since 2019 that the rare track has returned.

There were also some people claiming the track isn’t very good, and people shouldn’t care about it. Maybe that’s true, I’ve not played this particular <em>Mario Kart </em>course.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>It’s taken a couple of weeks for the full extent of <em>KPop Demon Hunters</em> to enter my field of view. For a while, all I’d seen of the Netflix animated phenomenon was the extremely…uh, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/shittymoviedetails/comments/1lpb52f/i_havent_seen_kpop_demon_hunters_so_i_have/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/shittymoviedetails/comments/1lpb52f/i_havent_seen_kpop_demon_hunters_so_i_have/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>exuberant</em> early scene</a></span> of its main cast of KPop idols getting real excited about their dinner, and the gifs from it being used <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://x.com/GOREJ1RA/status/1939835188982554998&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://x.com/GOREJ1RA/status/1939835188982554998" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">in some out-of-pocket ways</a></span> by gay and stan Twitter. Then, I saw some movie critics saying it would likely be in the conversation come awards season, and my interest was actually piqued. What finally put me over the edge was hearing one of the soundtrack’s standout songs: “Free.”</p><p>The hopeful ballad is a duet between Rumi, the lead singer of a demon-hunting trio group called Huntr/x, and Jinu, an up-and-coming boy band frontman who is secretly a demon seeking to weaken Huntr/x’s influence by stealing their fanbase out from under them. However, by this point in the film, the two opposing rivals have shifted into a star-crossed lovers era, and the result is a song that could easily stand alongside some of Disney’s classic love songs. After hearing just a few brief seconds of the soaring vocals, I knew I had to see what all the fuss was about. And y’all, if you were put off by the memery, I urge you to give <em>KPop Demon Hunters </em>a chance.</p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="197589" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="Ring Psychology: Understanding The 6 Phases Of A Wrestling Match Through Heel Era John Cena" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="659" data-playlist="197589,197586,197585" data-current="197589"><div><p>Ring Psychology: Understanding The 6 Phases Of A Wrestling Match Through Heel Era John Cena</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197589/197589_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197589/197589_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197589/197589_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/23110.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>Huntr/x is the latest group in a long line of demon hunters who use music to win the hearts and minds of the public, whose adoration in turn powers them in their demon-hunting efforts. Rumi, however, has an even more personal stake in seeing the demon and human world separated than her predecessors did, as she is part demon herself. For her entire life, Rumi has been told that if she and her bandmates can power the “Honmoon,” a barrier between both worlds, the demon markings on her skin will disappear, and she won’t have to hide who she is from her friends and fans. It’s very much giving Elsa’s story in <em>Frozen</em>, but the demon-hunting girl group framing gives it an edge that production studio Sony Pictures Animation bolsters with a vibrant visual style that makes you want to press a non-existent Screenshot button in your head every other shot.</p><p><em>KPop Demon Hunters</em>’ character arcs are a little tropey, but it pulls off its sentimentality and paranormal action with such confidence that I was still caught up in all of it. Its main trio’s story of superficial friendships being tested when shit gets real is poignant and punctuated by explosive, visually stunning fights with Jinu’s demon hordes. Whether its leads are dueling or dancing, <em>KPop Demon Hunters </em>is a pretty thrilling animated spectacle.</p><p>But a KPop movie is nothing without its songs, and <em>KPop Demon Hunters</em>’ soundtrack is full of bops. “Free” is still probably my standout favorite, but the assortment of Huntr/x songs and a few tracks by the rival demon group Saja Boys run the gamut of spunky power pop, flirtatious earworms, and anthemic stadium songs. The music is sung by some major KPop talent including Ejae, who provides Rumi’s singing voice and has worked with huge names in the space like Le Sserafim and Twice. So if you’re a KPop enthusiast and wondered if the film would have the talent to back up such a storied genre and industry, worry not.</p><p>All the gorgeous animation, music, and choreography in the world are great, but without an interesting storyline, <em>KPop Demon Hunters</em> would have still fallen flat. What surprised me the most about the movie is how it depicts stan culture and musicians’ impossible task of maintaining an audience in a world in which a viral hit can come and go. Though the film does approach this with a tongue-in-cheek, rapid-fire comedic attitude, the concept of a pop group having to maintain their fanbase lest they face the literal end of the world makes for a surprisingly layered setup. If you’ve ever been online and adjacent to pop fandoms (KPop and elsewhere), you know that the industry and fans love to pit two bad bitches against one another. Having what is essentially a stan battle between Huntr/x and Saja Boys serve as a potentially world-ending war is a clever foundation that could have allowed for deeper interrogation of real-world issues of unhinged fandom than the film cares to explore. I also wish <em>KPop Demon Hunters </em>would get a bit more pointed about some of the <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.koreaherald.com/article/3440558&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.koreaherald.com/article/3440558" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">systemic problems in the music industry like overwork</a></span>, which the film mostly chalks up to its girls being “workaholics,” but most of the industry talk in the movie is set dressing for it to deal with other, more universal topics. Can’t win them all, I suppose.</p><p>That being said, if your sole exposure to <em>KPop Demon Hunters </em>is a gif of Rumi passionately sniffing and eating kimbap, I do think you’ll find something to like in the movie. It’s beautifully animated with a killer soundtrack, and it’s just angsty enough that it can feed a fandom for ages.

Speaking about the <em>Ironheart</em> series premiere, Downey praised the episode’s ability to introduce a new character in <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/ironheart-riri-williams-breaking-bad-walter-white-1851784602&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/ironheart-riri-williams-breaking-bad-walter-white-1851784602">Riri Williams</a></span> while quickly establishing the impetus of her journey, developing the supporting cast, and complicating the show’s emotional core by giving her a dead friend as her AI sidekick. To the most important actor in the history of the MCU, Thorne ran “the whole gamut of an MCU film in 40 minutes.”</p><p>He’s not wrong. What made <em>Ironheart</em> one of my <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/andor-severance-black-mirror-daredevil-best-tv-shows-1851779606&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/andor-severance-black-mirror-daredevil-best-tv-shows-1851779606">favorite shows of 2025</a></span> is how ambitious the storytelling was from the very start. In the first episode alone, the show explores the world’s obsession with iron suits after Tony Stark’s death, centers the Iron Man legacy on intelligence rather than money by having Riri build a suit out of scrap metal, and uses childhood trauma to justify the creation of her AI assistant. Each of those story beats could’ve been entire episodes on lesser Marvel series.</p><p>Beyond his love of the show’s storytelling, Downey also explained how Tony Stark and Riri Williams are “twin flames.” It all begins with the heart. Tony Stark’s journey starts in <em>Iron Man</em> after one of his weapons explodes and a piece of shrapnel gets dangerously close to his heart. That injury—and Ho Yinsen (Shaun Toub) using an electromagnet to keep the shrapnel from reaching his heart—inspires the creation of the arc reactor, Stark’s most important invention. Riri’s heart is physically intact when her <em>Ironheart</em> journey begins, but Downey sees a philosophical connection between their origin stories.</p><p>“In this iteration, the heart is not only [about] going home, but also this disparity and inequity, and knowing she can only do as much as she can do.”</p><p>When this video was shot, he’d only watched the first three episodes of the show and he hints at a second conversation between the two that will take place after he finishes the series. Let’s all hope we get more intergenerational chats to push the superhero genre forward.</p></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://kotaku.com/robert-downey-jr-ironheart-iron-man-mcu-disney-plus-1851785928]]></content:encoded>

After all, they <em>seem </em>like a Drift that lets you keep moving straight, and Drifts are awesome! Charge Jumps generate Mini-Turbos just like drifting does too, and <em>Mario Kart World </em>features more wide straight paths than any game in the series has had before. You can even start charging another Charge Jump the second you land! This has to be a new speed-generating technique, right?</p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="196698" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="Princess Peach’s Leading Role And More New Releases" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="121" data-playlist="196698,195719,196572" data-current="196698"><div><p>Princess Peach’s Leading Role And More New Releases</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196698/196698_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196698/196698_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196698/196698_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196698/196698_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/22254.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>Unfortunately, it appears the opposite is true: <strong>Charge Jumps actually <em>slow you down</em>.</strong></p><p>Day-one <em>Kart </em>fans began to notice that Charge Jumps might actually come with a speed loss <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/mariokart/comments/1l4vd1x/does_the_charge_jump_slow_you_down/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/mariokart/comments/1l4vd1x/does_the_charge_jump_slow_you_down/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">shortly after release</a></span>. These findings were then confirmed via a YouTube video by Karting All Day titled “What’s the FASTEST way to go STRAIGHT in Mario Kart World?” Among the experiments shown in the video, a racer using Charge Jumps is shown going face to face against an identical racer who is simply accelerating forward without pressing any other buttons. The Charge Jump player definitively loses.</p><h2 id="h8480"><a id=""></a>The Charge Jump slows you down, no matter which character or vehicle you use</h2><p>The video by Karting All Day is probably enough evidence to show that you shouldn’t spam Charge Jumps in <em>Mario Kart World</em>, but just to be <em>extra </em>sure, I repeated the video’s experiments myself. I switched my test subjects to two Baby Marios using the Cute Scoot just to see if a low Top Speed and high Acceleration build would meaningfully change the results.</p><p>[Narrator’s voice]: it didn’t. </p><p>The Charge-Jump-spamming-Baby-Mario would always lose ground as soon as he initiated a Charge Jump, and the Mini-Turbo afterward just couldn’t make up the difference. The results were the same on water, though it did seem the two racers wound up closer together than they did during the land test. </p><figure id="" data-id="c5615d59b8f11e5a1be99c3f8f720deb" data-recommend-id="image://c5615d59b8f11e5a1be99c3f8f720deb" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Pianta rides on a rail." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Pianta rides on a rail." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Nintendo / Timothy Monbleau / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="c5615d59b8f11e5a1be99c3f8f720deb" data-recommend-id="image://c5615d59b8f11e5a1be99c3f8f720deb" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Pianta rides on a rail." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Frankly, even if there is a kart and driver combination that can get a <em>slight </em>speed boost from Charge Jumps under the right circumstances, I still wouldn’t recommend it. You’d be much better off looking for jumps to do tricks off of and grabbing item boxes than compromising your mobility for a virtually insignificant (at <em>best</em>) speed boost. Maybe a speedrunner will find a use for this tech on long straightaways, but for now, it’s not worth spamming.</p><h2 id="h8481"><a id=""></a>So, what’s the Charge Jump even good for then?</h2><p><strong>Despite everything said above, Charge Jumps are still useful! Just generating one spark while initiating a Charge Jump will give you enough air to latch onto grind rails</strong> (which the game officially calls “<span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/mario-kart-world-rail-wall-charge-jump-ride-switch-2-1851784648&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/mario-kart-world-rail-wall-charge-jump-ride-switch-2-1851784648">Rail Rides</a></span>”), which <em>can </em>increase your speed under the right circumstances. Even if a Rail Ride isn’t a speed boost, you still might prefer pulling one off to break away from a congested crowd of racers throwing an utter mess of items at each other. </p><p><strong>Charge Jumps can also be used to initiate Wall Rides</strong>, which are similarly situational speed boosts. Even if you aren’t an expert player looking to shave seconds off your World Record times, you do need to Wall Ride to get <em>several </em>Question Block Panels in <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/mario-kart-world-switch-2-coins-question-marks-outfits-1851784658&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/mario-kart-world-switch-2-coins-question-marks-outfits-1851784658">Free Roam mode</a></span>.

So long story short, even if you shouldn’t use Charge Jumps everywhere you go, you should absolutely experiment with them to see what shortcuts they might lead to. You might find routes that completely change the way you see certain tracks.</p><hr><p><br><em>Mario Kart World</em> is available now on Switch 2.  </p></div></div><br/><br/>https://kotaku.com/mario-kart-world-charge-jump-speed-boost-too-slow-1851785905]]></content:encoded>

His ability, the Entry Denial Device, is an explosive trap that attaches to doors and window frames and, once activated via movement, explodes outward, taking down enemy Attackers.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Lies of P</em> impressed us in 2023 with its fun and innovative weapon assembly system, which resulted in some of the most bizarre weapon creations in the Soulslike genre. With <em>Lies of P: Overture</em>, the game’s first and only major DLC, that trend continues with even weirder weapons than ever before. However, not every weapon is strange. Some, like the all-new bow, are simply new, but well worth acquiring.</p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="197589" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="Ring Psychology: Understanding The 6 Phases Of A Wrestling Match Through Heel Era John Cena" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="659" data-playlist="197589,197586,197585" data-current="197589"><div><p>Ring Psychology: Understanding The 6 Phases Of A Wrestling Match Through Heel Era John Cena</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197589/197589_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197589/197589_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197589/197589_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/23110.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>Serving as <em>Lies of P</em>’s very first fully ranged weapon, the Royal Horn Bow takes a bit of getting used to. While it doesn’t dish out quite the same level of damage as some stronger melee weapons, it can be an immensely useful secondary weapon to keep equipped for pulling enemies or picking off strays in the distance. </p><p>If that sounds up your alley, here’s where to find the Royal Horn Bow.</p><h2 id="h10945"><a id=""></a>Where to get the Royal Horn Bow in <em>Lies of P: Overture</em></h2><p><strong>The Royal Horn Bow can be found very early in <em>Lies of P: Overture</em></strong>. After working through some enemies in the opening of the DLC, you’ll eventually come to the Hall of Adventure Stargazer.</p><p>From the Stargazer, head up the right set of stairs and then take an immediate right at the top. Follow this hallway to the end, take a left, and clear any enemies around the destroyed glass cases in the next room.</p><p>Take the exit at the other end of the room and follow the next hallway while staying aware of an enemy who will burst through a window on your right. </p><p>In the following large room, you’ll spot a giant beast roaming below. Defeat it if you’d like, then take the large stairs up. At the fork, continue up the right set of stairs.</p><figure id="" data-id="fc5a14903f8b6c901c6d4cabde40a3be" data-recommend-id="image://fc5a14903f8b6c901c6d4cabde40a3be" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The protagonist opens a chest." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="The protagonist opens a chest." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Neowiz / Billy Givens / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="fc5a14903f8b6c901c6d4cabde40a3be" data-recommend-id="image://fc5a14903f8b6c901c6d4cabde40a3be" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The protagonist opens a chest." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>After weaving into the next room and back out again, defeating the goo-shooting foes within, you’ll exit to a chest. <strong>Open this chest to obtain the Royal Horn Bow</strong>. </p><p>This bow will be weak when you first get it, as it won’t be leveled up at all.
