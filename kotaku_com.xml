Another is only using points to purchase the rarest cards you’re least likely to get just by opening packs. But mostly it’s just a waiting game since the bulk of <em>Pokémon TCG Pocket</em> is governed by RNG and stamina meters. </p><p>I personally have clearly torpedoed my odds of getting a complete Genetic Apex set anytime soon, since instead of maximizing my chances of getting cards I don’t have, I’ve been focusing on getting Charizards, Mewtoos, and legendary birds Moltres and Articuno in order to wreck people in random battles. The rewards for winning are minuscule, but it’s a great way to kill time in-between waiting for my next booster pack to be ready. </p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

The app offers a lighter simulation of the excitement of the physical game, letting you open up booster packs, add them to your “binder,” and use those cards to build decks and battle other players or the computer. Much like the real TCG, you can choose to approach it as you prefer, whether that’s by collecting all the cards to admire the stellar artwork, or to create a brutal arsenal of <em>Pokémon </em>that will crush other players online.</p><p>You can also engage in different missions that provide rewards upon completion. Some of them can be fairly simple, such as opening a pack, while others could require you to collect specific cards or register a set number in the Card Dex—basically the record of your collection. Most of these will be completed just by playing the game, but you do need to remember to go into the Mission Menu to collect your rewards.</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="1ed7ae4b689c6d7a634f800183d1a917" data-recommend-id="image://1ed7ae4b689c6d7a634f800183d1a917" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="The Dex Missions list." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="The Dex Missions list." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->The Pokémon Company / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="1ed7ae4b689c6d7a634f800183d1a917" data-recommend-id="image://1ed7ae4b689c6d7a634f800183d1a917" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="The Dex Missions list." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>Much like the real world, you get more cards by opening booster packs. However, unlike their physical counterparts which contain ten cards, <em>Pokémon TCG Pocket </em>boosters (like those gained through code cards in <em>Pokémon TCG Live</em>) only contain five. The launch set is called Genetic Apex, with three different booster pack arts, Pikachu, Charizard and Mewtwo. These three types each have some specific cards unique to them: for example, if you want the Pikachu ex card, it’s only available in the Pikachu pack.</p><p>If there’s a particular card you’re looking for, make sure you are opening the correct type of pack. The card list for each, as well as their percentage chance of being pulled, can be viewed by tapping the “Offering Rates” Button in the left corner.</p><p>Of course, you can’t just open as many packs as you want. You need to make sure you have enough Pack Stamina, which refills automatically on a timer. Every 12 hours, the bar refills, allowing you to open up another pack. For those bad at math, this means you can open two packs a day, receiving only ten new cards a day. Fortunately, the game has some ways to speed up this timer, as well as other methods to get new cards, like the Wonder Pick.</p><p>The Wonder Pick is basically a roulette where you can select one random card from a pack that another player has opened. Don’t worry, you aren’t stealing from them, you are just getting a chance to get the same card they pulled. Depending on the rarity of the cards in their booster, it could cost up to three Wonder Stamina, which also refills on a timer. Wonder Pick can be a great way to get a specific card, but given the randomized nature of what you get, it can be frustrating spending three Wonder Stamina trying to get a full-art or EX card, only to get a garbage common one. Still, the option is there, so you might as well use it, especially once you start filling out your collection and need incredibly specific cards to complete it.</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="54093d3561b3a6fc6ab168bc5f3b37d1" data-recommend-id="image://54093d3561b3a6fc6ab168bc5f3b37d1" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="The My Cards screen." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="The My Cards screen." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->The Pokémon Company / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="54093d3561b3a6fc6ab168bc5f3b37d1" data-recommend-id="image://54093d3561b3a6fc6ab168bc5f3b37d1" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="The My Cards screen." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>When you open a pack, your cards are automatically added to the “My Cards” section, which can be viewed by pressing the second button from the left on the bottom of the screen. From here, you can create specific binders to show off cards from your collection, or build a display board to highlight a favorite card. This section also lets you add “Flair” to individual cards, which is just a cosmetic effect such as sparkles or bubbles, by consuming duplicates and Shine Dust. If you are having trouble adding flair to a card you have multiples of, make sure you have the correct quantity of copies of the card and ensure you will still have at least two remaining after the flair is purchased. Also note that Shine Dust is only used to add flair, so don’t worry about hoarding it.</p><p>By pressing a tab near the top of the screen, you can also toggle between recently added cards and their quantities, or have the cards organized by their placement in the expansion. The former is useful in quickly searching if you have enough duplicates to add flair, while the latter can be incredibly helpful in determining what is needed to fill holes in your collection.</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="83f37efad4790fe5d69562cf474a240c" data-recommend-id="image://83f37efad4790fe5d69562cf474a240c" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="The Premium Pass screen." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="The Premium Pass screen." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->The Pokémon Company / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="83f37efad4790fe5d69562cf474a240c" data-recommend-id="image://83f37efad4790fe5d69562cf474a240c" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="The Premium Pass screen." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>One of the many ways to spend money in <em>Pokémon TCG Pocket </em>is the Premium Pass subscription. This gives you access to an additional Stamina bar that refills every 24 hours, allowing one more pack to be opened per day. You will also gain access to Premium Missions that offer a unique currency called “Premium Tickets,” used for special rewards and cosmetics such as promo cards, or battle cosmetics like coins and sleeves. It costs $9.99 per month, which is a little steep for what you get, but there is a two-week free trial if you want to try to complete all the missions to snatch up the first set of redeemables, which are Mewtwo themed.</p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="e981e3a5455dd7aea234cab3688ecc49" data-recommend-id="image://e981e3a5455dd7aea234cab3688ecc49" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="The various hourglasses you can get in the game." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="The various hourglasses you can get in the game." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->The Pokémon Company / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="e981e3a5455dd7aea234cab3688ecc49" data-recommend-id="image://e981e3a5455dd7aea234cab3688ecc49" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="The various hourglasses you can get in the game." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>By playing the game and completing missions, you will probably notice you’re obtaining at least two types of hourglass items: Pack Hourglasses and Wonder Hourglasses. Both of these are consumables that can be used to refill their respective Stamina bar by one hour. For example, if you just opened a booster pack, you can use 12 Pack Hourglasses to immediately open another one.</p><p>You will gain these items by completing daily missions, or by leveling up, but you can also purchase them in the Shop by using a whole different type of currency called “Shop Tickets.” These are gained by completing the game’s “Step Up Battles,” which are <em>TCG Pocket’s</em> Computer Controlled fights, by completing Event Missions, and from gifts sent by other players after you’ve battled or Wonder Picked with them. It may be tempting to hoard your Hourglasses, but they can only be used to open packs, so don’t feel bad about using them to do so. Though, if you do save up 120 Pack Hourglasses, you can open ten packs at once which is a very cool experience.</p><p>When you first start the game, it’ll throw buckets of hourglasses at you, until you get very used to having them. Then it rather sharply reduces that rate, while nudging that you could always buy some more, so be careful not to get sucked into the sense that they’ll keep on flowing.</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="71007cebf26571e5ac9d84c03f1b4fa8" data-recommend-id="image://71007cebf26571e5ac9d84c03f1b4fa8" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="The Poke Gold shop screen." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="The Poke Gold shop screen." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->The Pokémon Company / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="71007cebf26571e5ac9d84c03f1b4fa8" data-recommend-id="image://71007cebf26571e5ac9d84c03f1b4fa8" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="The Poke Gold shop screen." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>It wouldn’t be a free-to-play game without a premium currency, so of course <em>Pokémon TCG Pocket </em>has one of those. Among many other ways to spend it, the creatively named Poké Gold can be used to speed up your Stamina bar if you find yourself short on hourglasses. You can use a combination of both Gold and hourglasses, and the game will automatically apply the most efficient usage of both. There is also currently bonus gold for buying the $1, $5 and $10 packages, but note these bonuses can only be used for each increment once.</p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="1563994953f600df48613bfed8a59aca" data-recommend-id="image://1563994953f600df48613bfed8a59aca" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="A screenshot of some of the Shop screen." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A screenshot of some of the Shop screen." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->The Pokémon Company / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="1563994953f600df48613bfed8a59aca" data-recommend-id="image://1563994953f600df48613bfed8a59aca" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="A screenshot of some of the Shop screen." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>Yes, there are more currencies. Mentioned briefly above, Shop Tickets are obtained by completing different missions or battles, and can be redeemed to buy item cards, different cosmetics, or hourglasses. These are probably the most versatile currency in the game, so they should be used on whatever you prefer. There are also Emblem Tickets which are awarded by completing Dex milestones, such as registering a set number of cards, and can<em>&nbsp;</em>be<em>&nbsp;</em>used to buy Emblems from the Store. Emblems are just badges you can apply to your profile, and don’t really have any impact on the game. Right now, the options are Pikachu, Charizard and Mewtwo, so if you have enough, just use it on whatever monster is your favorite of those. There are also Special Shop Tickets which can be gathered by spending regular Shop tickets, or consuming high-rarity cards. These let you purchase Special Series cosmetics such as coins and playmats, though they aren’t too exciting.</p><hr><p>For a game about collecting cards, <em>Pokémon TCG Pocket </em>complicates this simple hobby by including an obscene amount of currencies and cosmetics that may leave you with a headache even Psyduck could’t handle. While it is a lot to take in at first, most of these currencies can only be used on a specific aspect of the game—such as hourglasses—so you don’t need to worry about spending it on the “wrong” thing. Just play the game however you want, and good luck collecting ‘em all.</p><p>.</p></div></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Need some help blowing off that stress?

That’s right, put down <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/dragon-age-veilguard-4-review-dreadwolf-rook-action-rpg-1851681954&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/dragon-age-veilguard-4-review-dreadwolf-rook-action-rpg-1851681954"><em>Dragon Age: The Veilguard</em></a></span> and the major consequential decisions it asks you to make at any given point and pick up these relaxing and fun games to drown out the noise and troubles of the world instead.</p></div><div><p>We don’t need to mince words here: <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/stardew-valley-beginner-guide-patch-update-cozy-1851688289&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/stardew-valley-beginner-guide-patch-update-cozy-1851688289"><em>Stardew Valley </em>is the de facto cozy relaxing game of the generation</a></span>. And you know what’s pretty great about that? The console and mobile versions of <em>Stardew Valley </em>just received the 1.6 update that introduced a million changes that fans have explicitly asked for over the years, as well as fresh content by way of new events and dialogue. That’s right, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/games/stardew-valley&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/games/stardew-valley"><em>Stardew Valley</em></a></span><em> </em>is somehow still growing all these years later, and it’s now arguably in the best spot it’s ever been across every platform it’s available on. It has never been a better time to hide away by moving to a small town, inheriting your grandfather’s farm, and hitting on some cute locals.</p></div><div><p>There are a lot of things going on in the world that I have zero control over, but I can clean my own home, and that’s often enough for me. For years, I took for granted the euphoria of a clean space I could call my own, as well as the actual act of cleaning itself. I only really learned to appreciate it when <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/games/powerwash-simulator&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/games/powerwash-simulator"><em>PowerWash Simulator</em></a></span> finally released onto Game Pass, allowing me to<span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/powerwash-simulator-xbox-game-pass-steam-goat-clean-1849200259&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/powerwash-simulator-xbox-game-pass-steam-goat-clean-1849200259"> fly my freak flag</a></span> and clean up the most ridiculously unclean town I’ve ever seen.</p><p>I can’t do much about the things going on in the world right now. I’ve done my part already, despite how badly I want to clean up the messes that others keep making. But I can’t, and it’s important to know when to take care of others, and when to take care of myself. And when I finally make the call to do a little something for me, it often means turning off the lights, crawling into bed, throwing on some relaxing music, and powerwashing my troubles away. Let this be a balm for your soul like it has for me.</p></div><div><p>Okay, so I understand that I screamed at you all to ditch big RPGs that charge you with making huge decisions, so why not take on an even bigger one that doesn’t ask you to do any such thing?

But the great thing about <em>FFXIV</em>–and this is a staple of most MMOs if we’re being entirely honest–is how many supplementary things there are to do to immerse yourself in the world beyond the main story quest. Do you want to earn some titles and cute minions? Do literally anything else on offer, like become a master crafter, or fisher. There are multiple jobs that you can take on that have nothing to do with combat, dungeons, trials, or anything remotely like that. You can lock in to the most idle game content ever and spend your hours relaxing, casting a line, and chatting with friends in a Discord call. Take it from one of said friends who has been on that call, my friends seemed utterly blissed out, and that could (and perhaps should) be you, too.</p></div><div><p>Music is how I most often come down. The minute I pop my overpriced earphones into my head and put on my messy, uncurated playlist of liked songs, my worries wash away. Even now, I’m listening to Phoebe Bridgers and Connor Oberst’s joint record <em>Better Oblivion Community Center </em>to simultaneously listen to a record I’ve meant to throw on for some time now, put on something folk-adjacent to relax the nerves, and motivate me to write today. I’m chill as fuck now.

Similar to the effect music has on me in my real life, it <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/tetris-effect-is-the-game-i-ve-always-dreamed-of-1827720987&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/tetris-effect-is-the-game-i-ve-always-dreamed-of-1827720987">exposes the rhythm of all things</a></span>. There’s an ebb and flow to <em>Tetris Effect </em>that I could never see in other incarnations of the game. There’s a give and take, and I learned to appreciate it, and even make it work for me. I came to peace with the things I could and couldn’t do, and became better at seizing opportunities to make triumphant and huge plays. I learned to take my time and pick my moments, and by internalizing that, I made peace with some part of myself that rarely enjoyed it.</p><p><em>Tetris Effect actually </em>gave me that, but it’s also just a thoroughly relaxing version of <em>Tetris </em>set to trippy visuals and the aforementioned house music with lyrics about connectedness. If what you really need is a semblance of unity, perhaps in the face of overwhelming dread and an existential threat, there are few experiences that can soothe you like <em>Tetris Effect</em>.</p></div><div><p>My <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/games/the-sims-4&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/games/the-sims-4"><em>Sims</em></a></span><em> </em>girlies have always been ahead of the curve on this one, if I’m being totally honest. These games aren’t for me, but I can understand how they could be for others. Hell, life has gone sideways a million different ways, and a game enabling me to be delulu, remake myself, and act out my fantasies sounds like a wonderful gift.</p><p>I think it’s good that we all have something that we can have control over that routinely brings us some bit of joy or peace of mind. <em>Sims </em>is the blueprint, in this regard; the original feel- good game to relax withto and drown out the noise of the world with. <em>The SiIms 4</em>, like the rest of the series before it, is an exercise in complete and selfish control, a luxury so many of us are often denied, and risk having taken away from us at numerous disappointing junctures.</p><hr><p>I don’t know about you all, but I could stand to pull a bit of a disappearing act right now. The <em>Final Fantasy XIV Online </em>icon on my desktop is looking mighty tempting, and while I’ve resisted it for some time now, maybe I owe it to myself to go somewhere better. At least, until the real world begins resembling my greatest fantasies a bit more. Anything but this, y’know?<br></p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

As an apology for all this, players are being given a single free car. </p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="195410" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="The Top 10 Most-Played Games On Steam Deck: July 2023 Edition" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="169" data-playlist="195410,195189,196358" data-current="195410"><div><p>The Top 10 Most-Played Games On Steam Deck: July 2023 Edition</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195410/195410_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195410/195410_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195410/195410_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195410/195410_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/20876.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p><em>Test Drive Unlimited: Solar Crown</em>, which had <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/paid-early-access-pre-order-madden-star-wars-outlaws-1851596675#:~:text=I%20also%20want,to%20seven%20days.&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/paid-early-access-pre-order-madden-star-wars-outlaws-1851596675#:~:text=I%20also%20want,to%20seven%20days.">three different release dates</a></span> depending on how much money you spent on it, arrived in September to negative reviews from critics and players. For some who forked over nearly $100, for the fanciest version that provided the earliest access, the game was basically unplayable due to server issues for days. Other players shared videos of physics and graphical bugs. In other words, <em>Solar Crown’</em>s launch was a big mess, and now, for those early players, the developers are offering a free (digital) Porsche as an apology, alongside a large update. </p><p>On November 4, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1249970/view/4505380324428942357&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1249970/view/4505380324428942357" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>Test Drive</em> publisher Nacon and developer KT Racing posted an update to Steam</a></span> thanking players for their “patience and support.” And to help win people back, those who logged into <em>Solar Crown </em>before October 12 will automatically receive the “Adventurer” edition of the 1986 Porsche 911 Carrera Coupe after Season 2 launches. </p><p>Meanwhile, Nacon and KT Racing announced that on Tuesday the second major patch for <em>TDU Solar Crown </em>will be available on all platforms. This patch is focused on improving stability and performance on Xbox, PS5, and PC. The patch also promises to fix many of the server login issues players have been encountering since September. </p><p>“Over the past few weeks, we’ve worked hard to roll out multiple maintenance phases and hotfixes aimed at enhancing the game,” explained Nacon. “We know there’s still work to be done, and we hear you. Please know that your feedback is invaluable, and our development team is fully dedicated to addressing the issues you’re encountering as quickly as possible, while also refining features to ensure a smoother, more enjoyable gaming experience for everyone.”<br></p><p>Will a free car and the promise of more fixes be enough to win players over? I’m not sure. So far, the game’s Steam review rating is still standing at Mostly Negative. So there’s still a lot of work to be done if Nacon and KT Racing want to turn this car around.</p><hr><p>Here are the full patch notes for <em>Test Drive Unlimted Solar Crown’</em>s new major update:</p><h2 id="h17997"><a id=""></a>Servers/Network</h2><ul data-type="List" data-style="Bullet"><li>Fixed various login issues</li></ul><h2 id="h17998"><a id=""></a>Performance/Stability</h2><ul data-type="List" data-style="Bullet"><li>Reduced shadow cost in performance<br></li><li>Added various optimizations to improve memory consumption and overall stability<br></li><li>Fixed a crash that could happen when entering a spot<br></li><li>Fixed a crash that could happen when traffic spawned<br></li><li>Fixed a crash that could happen while buying car parts<br></li><li>PC: Fixed a crash that could occur when playing with certain AMD GPUs<br></li><li>PS5: Reduced frame drops in performance mode<br></li></ul><h2 id="h17999"><a id=""></a>Graphics</h2><ul data-type="List" data-style="Bullet"><li>Improved global illumination performance<br></li><li>Improved octree tracing performance<br></li><li>Improved shadow quality created by headlights<br></li><li>Improved SSR upscaling<br></li><li>PC: Use DLAA instead of FSR TAA by default when available<br></li><li>PS5: Improved quality mode resolution from 1080p to 1440p<br></li></ul><h2 id="h18000"><a id=""></a>Compatibility</h2><ul data-type="List" data-style="Bullet"><li>PC: Fixed binding and default preset on Thrustmaster TMX wheel<br></li><li>PC: Fixed Logitech G923 default binding<br></li><li>PC: Fixed Moza devices default preset<br></li><li>PC: Fixed issue where FFB was lost when the mouse was moved<br></li><li>PC: Fixed issue where FFB could still be present when navigating menus<br></li><li>PS5 &amp;
