Nintendo announced the new gaming console with a short YouTube video showcasing the new hardware, which includes magnetic Joy-Con controllers, a bigger screen, and backwards compatibility with original Switch games. It also gives fans their first glimpse of what people are speculating is <em>Mario Kart 9</em>.</p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="194644" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="The Week In Games: Return To Hyrule" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="165" data-playlist="194644,195670,196626" data-current="194644"><div><p>The Week In Games: Return To Hyrule</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/194644/194644_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/194644/194644_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/194644/194644_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/194644/194644_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/20101.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p><strong>Read More: </strong><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/mario-kart-9-nintendo-switch-2-announcement-trailer-1851740833&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/mario-kart-9-nintendo-switch-2-announcement-trailer-1851740833">Did Nintendo Just Reveal <em>Mario Kart 9?</em></a></span></p><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/switch-2-announcement-nintendo-console-rumor-date-1851738104&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/switch-2-announcement-nintendo-console-rumor-date-1851738104">The reveal day lines up with leaks earlier this week</a></span> indicating that Nintendo was preparing to show off the Switch 2 for real after somehow going all of 2024 without so much as a peep about its upcoming hardware, not even revealing the new device’s name. We didn’t get a the release date today beyond the fact that it’s coming sometime in 2025, but we did get the official name. Switch successor is indeed called the Nintendo Switch 2. How un-Nintendo of them!</p><p>The trailer shows off a bigger, sleeker upgrade to the 2017 hardware that’s sold over 150 million units. The new Joy-Con are black instead of red and blue, and the right one has a new, mysterious c-button. They attach to the screen—which is larger with a smaller bezel—with magnets. But Nintendo still hasn’t gone into detail on the official specs or what the hardware will be capable of. It looks cool though:</p><p>A quick segment near the end of the trailer appears to show the upgraded Joy-Con moving like a PC gaming mouse, possibly an allusion to a new optical tracking capability. The company also reiterated that the Switch 2 will play Switch games, but with a major caveat. “Certain Nintendo Switch games may not be supported on or fully compatible with Nintendo Switch 2,” a disclaimer at the end of the trailer reads. It’s unclear which games will be included in that carve-out, but more information is promised on Nintendo’s website at a later date. </p><p>Nintendo’s official Switch 2 reveal comes <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/nintendo-switch-2-rumors-genki-ces-2025-official-1851736830&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/nintendo-switch-2-rumors-genki-ces-2025-official-1851736830">after weeks of alleged leaks purporting to show everything</a></span> about the new console from its motherboard to its new magnetic Joy-Con connectors. The sum total of the rumors amounted to the new device being an upgraded Switch <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/switch-2-joy-con-nintendo-new-features-1851735307?_gl=1*1r5k8ox*_ga*MzQzNjkwNDM2LjE2NDY2NjQ1NzQ.*_ga_V4QNJTT5L0*MTczNjg4MjQyMy4yNzcuMC4xNzM2ODgyNDI3LjU2LjAuMA..&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/switch-2-joy-con-nintendo-new-features-1851735307?_gl=1*1r5k8ox*_ga*MzQzNjkwNDM2LjE2NDY2NjQ1NzQ.*_ga_V4QNJTT5L0*MTczNjg4MjQyMy4yNzcuMC4xNzM2ODgyNDI3LjU2LjAuMA..">with a bigger screen and a more powerful processor</a></span> but otherwise largely the same hybrid gaming tablet everyone’s come to love since the original launched back in 2017. And they basically all turned out to be right.</p><p>Whether the Switch 2 can pull off a similar year-one coup will depend mostly on what first-party exclusives the system launches with. The one-two punch of <em>The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild</em> and <em>Super Mario Odyssey</em> was a powerful recipe for success with the original hardware. Can the Switch 2 muster a similarly impressive lineup? <em>Mario Kart 9</em>, which certainly looks like what’s been revealed in the Switch 2 preview trailer, would make for a great start. </p><p>One thing that might help is a <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/halo-master-chief-collection-ps5-switch-2-port-1851737175&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/halo-master-chief-collection-ps5-switch-2-port-1851737175">steady drumbeat of third-party ports from Xbox, Ubisoft, and others</a></span>. We’ll no doubt find out in the days and months ahead as the company announces the rest of the Switch 2's official launch lineup. </p><p><em>Update 1/16/2025 8:43 a.m. ET: Added more info from the trailer about the Switch 2. </em></p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

If you missed it, Nintendo <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/switch-2-reveal-trailer-date-nintendo-mario-kart-9-1851739487&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/switch-2-reveal-trailer-date-nintendo-mario-kart-9-1851739487">finally revealed the Switch 2</a></span> after months of leaks and teases. It’s coming out this year, has a bigger screen, magnetic joy-con controllers, and can play the original Switch’s games through backwards compatibility. Also, Nintendo may have nonchalantly announced a new <em>Mario Kart </em>game alongside the system announcement.</p><p>As you can see in this trailer, the Switch 2 is shown playing a <em>Mario Kart </em>game, and while I initially thought it was <em>Mario Kart 8 Deluxe </em>at a glance, <em>Mario Kart </em>fans <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://x.com/adifying/status/1879877991414812977&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://x.com/adifying/status/1879877991414812977" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">don’t seem</a></span> <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://x.com/nemesislacroix/status/1879878852769640544&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://x.com/nemesislacroix/status/1879878852769640544" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">to recognize</a></span> the track players are racing through. It looks like the Switch 2 could launch with <em>Mario Kart 9</em>. One of the most notable differences between the game we saw and previous <em>Mario Karts</em> is Donkey Kong. If you look at the gorilla racer in the background of different shots, you’ll notice he looks pretty similar to his <em>Super Mario Bros. Movie </em>counterpart, rather than the classic design seen in games like <em>Mario Kart 8</em>. Some fans have observed that Mario’s proportions seem to be a little more cartoony and similar to the recent <em>Super Mario Wonder</em>, as well. So while Nintendo didn’t officially put a name to the footage, it’s a pretty reasonable leap to assume this is <em>Mario Kart 9</em>.</p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="194644" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="The Week In Games: Return To Hyrule" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="165" data-playlist="194644,196626,196698" data-current="194644"><div><p>The Week In Games: Return To Hyrule</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/194644/194644_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/194644/194644_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/194644/194644_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/194644/194644_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/20101.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>Fans have been combing through the brief bits of footage to determine some of the playable racers, and the roster we can see includes: Mario, Luigi, Bowser, Peach, Yoshi, Toad, Daisy, Rosalina, Donkey Kong, and what appears to be Paulina, Toadette, a Goomba, and a Koopa.</p><p>We’ll get a better look at the next <em>Mario Kart </em>and the Switch 2 in April, as Nintendo has confirmed it will hold a Direct presentation on the system <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/nintendo-direct-switch-2-release-date-april-2025-1851740848&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/nintendo-direct-switch-2-release-date-april-2025-1851740848">on April 2</a></span>.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
