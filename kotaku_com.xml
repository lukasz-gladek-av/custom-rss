              <p><em>Magic: The Gathering</em>‘s Marvel Super Heroes set arrives next June, just in time for <a href="https://kotaku.com/avengers-endgame-rerelease-movie-theater-tickets-doomsday-2000651023"><em>Avengers</em> to return to theaters and <em>Doomsday</em></a> to debut at the end of the year. But the <a href="https://kotaku.com/magic-gathering-mtg-star-trek-marvel-avengers-2026-sets-2000629313">licensed Universes Beyond expansions</a> have been at their best when they add more flavor to the trading card game rather than just lean on it for publicity. On Tuesday, Wizards of the Coast gave fans a taste of what to expect from the latest comic-book-inspired set, from Incredible Hulk card art to new Captain America card mechanics.</p> <p>The company teased 38 new cards on its <a href="https://magic.wizards.com/en/news/feature/marvel-super-heroes-preview-prologue">latest WeeklyMTG show</a>. There’s plenty of Legendary Creatures, some neat spells, and lots of really nifty art. There’s Captain America, a 3/2 white creature with a shield counter that protects it from one instance of damage. There’s Bruce Banner, a 1/1 blue who can transform into the Hulk with an Enrage condition that gives him a +1/+1 counter when damaged and a second attack phase.</p>

 <figure id="attachment_2000651829" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000651829"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000651829">Wizards of the Coast</figcaption></figure> <figure id="attachment_2000651830" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000651830"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000651830">Wizards of the Coast</figcaption></figure> <p>And then there’s Doctor Doom, a 3/3 black creature that enters with Doombot tokens, lets players draw a card and take damage at the end of their turn, and is indestructible while an artifact creature or Plan is on the field. Wizards also revealed a notable reprint of Heroic Intervention, with the effect of “Permanents you control gain hexproof and indestructible until end of turn.” The set has a Horn of Greed, too, with the perfect Doctor Doom “toot” art.</p>

 <p>While the reprints each have callbacks to some classic Marvel comic book art, my favorite-looking cards so far are the full-art variants of Widow-Making Infiltrator, Dig Through Time, and Elektra, Deadly Assassin. And for all your Saga nerds out there, we have World War Hulk, which ends with doubling a creature’s power and toughness and giving it trample, and The Coming of Galactus, which culminates in a 16/16 black Elder Alien with flying, trample, and “Whenever Galactus attacks, destroy target land.”</p> <p>I wasn’t too impressed with the Marvel set when it was initially revealed earlier this year. Coming right after Spider-Man and in the midst of a glut of other Universes Beyond crossovers, it seemed likely to be another property stretched thin and rushed out to keep the release calendar rolling. These initial card reveals look promising, though. I’m intrigued. Maybe I wasn’t as burnt out on Marvel as I thought. I might just have to chase Galactus after all.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/airpods-pro-3-return-to-black-friday-record-low-on-amazon-apple-store-still-charges-full-price-2000651653</link>

              <p>Apple never puts its newest products on sale, especially not something as new as the AirPods Pro 3 which came out just a few months ago. But Amazon has taken matters into its own hands and cut prices on almost all of Apple’s products right before Christmas. For instance, <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4214/">you can get these third-generation AirPods Pro for $219 instead of the usual $249</a> which is the same price as the lowest price we saw on Black Friday. You might be tempted to buy the older AirPods Pro 2 because they are cheaper, but this newer model has so many more features powered by Apple Intelligence that if you don’t upgrade, you’ll miss out on features that change the way you use wireless earbuds.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4214/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Efficient Noise Cancellation</h2>
<p>Apple says that the <strong>AirPods Pro 3 block out twice as much unwanted noise as the already-great Pro 2 model</strong> – and it means that subway rumble, airplane engine drone, and coffee shop chatter almost completely disappear. The active noise cancellation changes in real time based on the shape of your ear canal and the fit of the ear tips and keeps changing to keep out as much outside noise as possible. The <strong>box now comes with five different ear tip sizes</strong> instead of the three it used to have to make sure you can find a snug fit that makes the best seal for the best noise cancellation and bass response.</p>
<p>The audio architecture was completely changed to focus on what Apple calls <em>“three-dimensional sound,”</em> which makes music feel like it’s happening around you instead of inside your head. Bass hits with more depth and power without drowning out the midrange, and high frequencies give you clear detail that lets you hear each instrument in a complicated arrangement. The vocals are very clear and present, putting the singers right in front of you in the soundstage. When you turn your head, <strong>spatial audio with dynamic head tracking</strong> keeps sound sources anchored to your iPhone or iPad which makes for an immersive experience that is especially fun when watching movies or playing games.</p>



<p>One of the most useful new features of the AirPods Pro 3 is heart rate sensing: It turns your earbuds into workout partners that <strong>can track your heart rate and calorie burn for 50 different types of exercise</strong>. This information syncs with the Activity app on your iPhone, adding to your Move ring and step count. It also gives you useful information through the new Workout Buddy feature powered by Apple Intelligence.</p>
<p><em>Live Translation</em> uses Apple Intelligence to process speech and give instant translations that sound natural: This breaks down language barriers in real-time conversations. Think about going to another country and being able to talk to people there without having to pull out your phone or look for a translation app: The feature works with many languages and gets better as Apple Intelligence learns from more interactions. Active Hearing Protection keeps an eye on the noise levels in your environment all the time and it lowers the volume when you’re around sounds that could hurt your ears, like construction work, concerts, or loud traffic.</p>



<p>The Hearing Aid feature uses the great fit and noise processing to work as a clinical-grade hearing aid, complete with automatic Conversation Boost to boost speech frequencies. You can even use your iPhone and AirPods Pro 3 to take a hearing test at home which will give you personalized audio profiles that make listening to music, calls, and media more enjoyable. With active noise cancellation turned on, the battery lasts for eight hours and with Transparency mode and hearing aid functionality turned on, the battery lasts for up to ten hours.</p>
<p>It might not sound like much, but Apple products don’t usually go on sale this soon after they come out, so this price is very good by Apple’s standards. You can get flagship earbuds at a lower price before the holiday shopping season ends because Amazon matched the Black Friday record low in mid-December. You’re buying earbuds that work as fitness trackers, hearing aids, translation devices, and high-end audio equipment all in one package which makes the price worth it even before the discount is taken into account.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[McDonalds Got Bullied So Badly It Deleted Its AI Christmas Ad]]></title>
            <link>https://kotaku.com/mcdonalds-ai-christmas-ad-deleted-comments-removed-bad-2000651791</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Earlier this month, McDonald’s Netherlands put out an ugly and lifeless Christmas commercial that was created using AI generation tools. Over the weekend, after the ad spot went viral online for all the wrong reasons, the fast-food chain deleted it.</p> <p>Recently, <a href="https://kotaku.com/coca-cola-ai-tv-commerical-ad-coke-generated-holiday-1851700865">McDonald’s followed in the footsteps of Coca-Cola</a> and released <a href="https://x.com/CultureCrave/status/1998108853444169807">a new AI-generated advertisement</a> just in time for the holiday season. The ad features numerous AI-generated scenes of people dealing with all the horrible, annoying, and not-so-great moments that can happen during this time of year. It’s genuinely a funny little idea for an ad, but it’s hard to watch and enjoy when it’s so clearly AI-generated.</p>

 <p>This is normally the part where I’d embed the ad via an official source, like the McDonald’s YouTube account. But, <a href="https://futurism.com/artificial-intelligence/mcdonalds-ai-generated-commercial">as spotted by <em>Futurism</em></a>, I can’t do that because the fast food company has seemingly removed it entirely from the internet, a step it took after previously shutting down comments on the ad. So here’s a reupload of it via the YouTube channel CongenAI:</p>

  <p>Perhaps the wildest part of all of this is that the studio behind the awful-looking AI ad claimed that it crunched for weeks to produce this slop. Seriously. <a href="https://80.lv/articles/mcdonald-s-unveils-an-ai-generated-christmas-ad-that-somehow-looks-worse-than-coca-cola-s">Here’s the full statement</a> from the studio, <a href="https://lbbonline.com/news/McDonalds-Netherlands-AI-Terrible-Truth-of-December">Sweetshop</a>, which has also since been deleted:</p> <blockquote><p>“For seven weeks, we hardly slept, with up to 10 of our in-house AI and post specialists at The Gardening Club working in lockstep with the directors. Every shot travelled through a rigorously engineered toolchain: real Google Earth plates, advanced style-transfer, pixel-level photo repair, custom LoRAs, control nets, bespoke ComfyUI graphs, and thousands upon thousands of tightly steered iterations.</p> <p>Then came compositing, lighting balance, physics corrections, artefact removal, and final finishing in Flame. We generated what felt like dailies – thousands of takes – then shaped them in the edit just as we would on any high-craft production. This wasn’t an AI trick. It was a film. And here’s the thing I wish more people understood: magic isn’t the technology. The magic is the team behind it, people who pushed, questioned, experimented, swore at broken models, solved impossible problems, and refused to stop until every frame felt cinematic.</p> <p>I don’t see this spot as a novelty or a cute seasonal experiment. To me, it’s evidence of something much bigger: that when craft and technology meet with intention, they can create work that feels genuinely cinematic. So no – AI didn’t make this film. We did.”</p></blockquote> <p>Personally, I think it would be easier and better to just have a camera crew and a director film some actors, maybe add some stock footage in, and not make something horrible in a way that sounds both tedious and terrible. But I’m just old-fashioned like that, I guess.</p>
