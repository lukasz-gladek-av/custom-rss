Yet, in recent years, we’ve seen a trend of animated movies and franchises being remade in live-action (or, sometimes, CGI that’s meant to mimic live action with its realism), like Disney’s <em>The Lion King</em> or Universal’s upcoming<em> </em><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/how-to-train-your-dragon-live-action-trailer-2025-httyd-1851703309&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/how-to-train-your-dragon-live-action-trailer-2025-httyd-1851703309"><em>How To Train Your Dragon</em></a></span>. So you might wonder if Wallace and his silent dog Gromit will ever get a live-action remake. According to the duo’s creator, Nick Park, that ain’t ever happening. </p><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.polygon.com/movies/501986/wallace-gromit-netflix-live-action-disney-remake&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.polygon.com/movies/501986/wallace-gromit-netflix-live-action-disney-remake" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>Polygon </em>talked to Park about the upcoming <em>Wallace &amp; Gromit</em> movie</a></span>, <em>Vengeance Most Fowl, </em>and asked him about the possibility of the duo getting a fancy live-action remake. According to the outlet, his response was quick: </p><p> “Well, it’s quite an easy answer,” said Park. “NOOOOOOOO.” </p><p>Park isn’t against bringing the characters to more platforms and mediums. For example, there have been <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/games/wallace-and-gromits-grand-adventures&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/games/wallace-and-gromits-grand-adventures"><em>Wallace &amp; Gromit </em>video games</a></span>. But when it comes to the big movies and shorts, Park thinks the characters will “always be clay.” </p><p> “I think [the clay] is part of the character, it’s part of their soul to be that medium. It’s what they were born out of and [losing the clay] might take something away. It’s quite hard to define. ‘Thumby and funny’ is the phrase we’ve often used.”</p><p>While <em>Wallace &amp; Gromit</em> won’t be making the leap to live action anytime soon, Disney is continuing to push ahead with its attempts at turning its popular animated features into live-action hits.

Thankfully, we know how to mute players in <em>Marvel Rivals</em> so you don’t have to listen to the white noise of someone’s oscillating fan if you don’t want to.</p><h2 id="h669765"><a id="console"></a>How to mute players on PS5 and Xbox</h2><figure id="" data-id="dc5476381867950c83a43bab6b58adaa" data-recommend-id="image://dc5476381867950c83a43bab6b58adaa" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The Match Settings screen, with the cursor highlighting one teammate's muted voice chat." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="The Match Settings screen, with the cursor highlighting one teammate's muted voice chat." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Marvel Games / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="dc5476381867950c83a43bab6b58adaa" data-recommend-id="image://dc5476381867950c83a43bab6b58adaa" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The Match Settings screen, with the cursor highlighting one teammate's muted voice chat." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p><em>Marvel Rivals</em> makes great use of the many keys on a keyboard, but quite a few functions aren’t included as part of the default controls on PlayStation or Xbox. </p><ul data-type="List" data-style="Bullet"><li>Press the Menu/Options button on your controller during a match.</li><li>Select Settings and you should be taken to the Match Settings tab which lists the players of both teams. If you were messing around with some settings earlier, you might need to manually switch to the Match tab.</li><li><strong>Click on the message or speaker icons to the right of the player names; this will mute the text and voice chat respectively for those players.</strong>&nbsp;</li><li>You can also click the microphone icon next to your name to mute your voice from going through.</li></ul><p>This won’t take too long once you get used to it, but it can still be an awkward thing to do during a match unless you’re waiting to respawn. Fortunately, there’s a shortcut.</p><ul data-type="List" data-style="Bullet"><li>Go to the Settings menu during a match or on the main menu screen.</li><li>Move over to the Controller tab using R1/RB.</li><li>Move to the Communication sub-tab using R2/RT.</li><li>Scroll down until you find the option to remap a button for the Voice Chat Menu. Don’t let the name confuse you, it’s referring to the Match Settings screen.</li><li>Pick a button of your preference to remap this handy shortcut.</li></ul><p>You’ll then be able to immediately go to the Match Settings Screen by pressing that button while playing. If you’re unsure of what to get rid of for it, I recommend remapping it over the Chrono Vision button. Developing a general knowledge and familiarity with the maps will make that ability redundant anyway. Chrono Vision is set to the right Directional Pad/Button by default.</p><h2 id="h669766"><a id="pc"></a>How to mute players on PC</h2><p>Muting a toxic player is a lot faster on the PC version of <em>Marvel Rivals</em>. For starters, you can do it the longer way console players use. That means navigating to Settings, Match Settings, and then choosing who to mute. Who has time for all that though? Any time spent on a menu is time you could be making use of your <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/marvel-rivals-hero-shooter-overwatch-team-attacks-how-1851718182&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/marvel-rivals-hero-shooter-overwatch-team-attacks-how-1851718182">Team-Up abilities</a></span>. Luckily, the PC version already has a default key that leads right where you need to go.</p><p><strong>Press the P key and you’ll find yourself at the Match Settings screen.</strong> Look for the player(s) who are disrupting your play, and click on the message or speaker icons next to their usernames to mute text and voice chat from them. </p><h2 id="h669767"><a id="text"></a>How to disable text chat</h2><figure id="" data-id="df8cea084a8a4996d396ccd6bf5b9fb7" data-recommend-id="image://df8cea084a8a4996d396ccd6bf5b9fb7" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The Social Settings tab, with the cursor hovering over the Chat submenu." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="The Social Settings tab, with the cursor hovering over the Chat submenu." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Marvel Games / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="df8cea084a8a4996d396ccd6bf5b9fb7" data-recommend-id="image://df8cea084a8a4996d396ccd6bf5b9fb7" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The Social Settings tab, with the cursor hovering over the Chat submenu." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Any form of chat is important for Competitive matches, but I won’t judge you for preferring to rely on the Ping system in Quick matches. If you just want to avoid seeing particular types of messages in general, you can filter out what goes through the chat. Simply go to the Settings menu and move over to the Social tab. The Chat submenu allows you to enable or disable the following message types:</p><ul data-type="List" data-style="Bullet"><li>Friend Whisper Messages</li><li>Team Messages</li><li>Event Messages</li><li>Faction Messages</li><li>Spectator Messages</li></ul><p>Curiously, there doesn’t seem to be a way to automatically disable chat from the enemy’s team. The only way to stop seeing trash talk from the opposing side is to individually mute them as we covered above.</p><p>Muting players might feel like a mean thing to do, but it’s worth it if you don’t think it will be a major detriment to the team. And it’s certainly the right thing to do if someone’s being toxic. There is nothing wrong with zoning out during some quick matches and just having fun with your <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/marvel-rivals-hero-shooter-free-skins-ps5-psplus-1851721614&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/marvel-rivals-hero-shooter-free-skins-ps5-psplus-1851721614">free skins</a></span>. Either way, the option to mute players is present for multiple reasons, so don’t feel bad about using it.</p><p>.<br></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

It’s also full of rich metaphoric language ripe for creative license and re-interpretation. The movie is set to begin filming next year. </p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

If you paid more, you got PC and streaming games, too.</p><p>But in the summer, Xbox announced a big price hike for all Xbox plans. Xbox Game Pass Ultimate, the plan that included everything, went from $17 to $20. Meanwhile, the console-only plan, which previously cost $11 a month, was being retired and replaced with a new “Game Pass Standard” tier that cost $15 a month and would no longer include day-one releases. Xbox explained that eventually some day-one releases would land on Standard, but didn’t specify a timetable. </p><p>To sum it up: Everyone is paying more for Game Pass, but not everyone gets access to big new games like <em>Call of Duty Black Ops 6</em> at launch. Not great! For as long as Game Pass has been a thing, the promise of day-one first-party titles like <em>Halo </em>has been its big selling point. But in 2024, seemingly to help cover the cost of spending nearly $70 billion on Activision, Xbox has ruined what was once the best deal in gaming.</p><h2 id="h65746"><a id=""></a><strong>Everything Is An Xbox, Including Your PS5 And Switch</strong></h2><p>Maybe the weirdest Microsoft storyline that unfolded in 2024 is the way the company tried to navigate its dwindling console sales numbers while telling Xbox fans not to worry. </p><p>I mean, if you look at everything that happened in 2024, it doesn’t paint a good picture for Xbox consoles.

That sounds less like a confident and well-developed blueprint for the future and more like a messy bundle of promises and individual plans meant to distract us from reality. </p><h2 id="h65747"><a id=""></a><strong>The Future Is Looking Weird For Xbox And Microsoft</strong></h2><p>As 2024 draws to a close, here is the reality of the situation: Xbox seems to be aimlessly moving forward as Microsoft focuses most of its money on AI. </p><p>Sure, Xbox has a huge stable of studios and publishers that will help it develop and release more games than ever before across more platforms in 2025 and beyond. It can’t seem to support all of these studios, however, and keeps closing them or laying people off. </p><p>Game Pass is now a questionable and expensive subscription plan that is a very shitty version of what we used to have, and which is only likely to get worse as Microsoft looks to keep numbers growing amid a lack of new users. </p><p>And if you’re looking to buy a new console, it almost seems like a gamble at this point to invest in an Xbox Series X/S. I’m not suggesting Microsoft will flip a switch and kill its consoles overnight. But as the company invests more and more into streaming and makes more of its exclusives multiplatform, there are fewer and fewer reasons to own an Xbox, whatever that even means in 2024.</p><p>2025 could also be a massive year for Xbox. It has new games coming from Bethesda, Activision, and its own many studios in the next few months, and will likely announce more as the year goes on. But 2024 was also a big year for Xbox; it’s just that the cost was massive job cuts, big price increases, and multiple studio closures. So while some Xbox fans might be excited for another big year, I’m truly concerned about how much more blood will be spilled to pay for it. </p><p> .<br></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
