              <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-shiny-odds-scarlet-violet-ivs-red-gyarados-1850248457"><span>Shiny hunters</span></a><span> are Arceus’ strongest soldiers in the </span><i><span>Pokémon </span></i><span>community, but I think we may have found the strongest among them. One fan did a somewhat unorthodox Shiny hunt not in one of the </span><i><span>Pokémon </span></i><span>RPGs, but in a 20-year-old battle simulator spin-off on the Wii. Collecting these alternate-colored monsters in it is far more complicated than doing so in your average </span><i><span>Pokémon </span></i><span>game.</span></p> <p><span>User Noa_Kyogre on X (thanks, </span><a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/pokemon/pokemon-player-spends-5-years-completing-one-of-the-weirdest-shiny-hunts-in-history-immediately-promises-to-never-do-it-again/"><i><span>Gamesradar</span></i></a><span>) took five years to find Shiny costumes in </span><i><span>Pokémon Battle Revolution</span></i><span>. The Wii game doesn’t have wild Pokémon encounters, but its various trainers can dress up as monsters if the player chooses to wear themed outfits based on creatures like Groudon, Kyogre, Roserade, and Lucario. However, it’s possible to find these outfits in their respective Pokémon’s Shiny colors, such as a yellow-and-green Lucario rather than its usual blue-and-black color scheme. It will just take you thousands of hours of playtime to do it.</span></p>

 <p><span>You can acquire these outfits by beating a trainer wearing them in the game’s single-player mode, but each of these trainers shows up during what is essentially a long boss rush of high-level battles, and their outfits have as little a chance of changing as a rare Pokémon has of showing up in a base game. That’s a roughly 1 in 8192 spawn chance.&nbsp;</span></p> <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="ja" dir="ltr">ポケモンバトルレボリューション (通称バトレボ)<br>日本語版と海外版 それぞれで色違いコスチューム コンプリートしました！😋💫<br>多分、史上初だと思います🤔<br>海外版は肌の色が3種類から選べるので褐色ガチ神！😍<br>多分5〜6年ぐらいこの厳選やってました！🤣<a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/%E8%89%B2%E9%81%95%E3%81%84%E3%83%9D%E3%82%B1%E3%83%A2%E3%83%B3?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#色違いポケモン</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/ShinyPokemon?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#ShinyPokemon</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/Shinyhunt?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#Shinyhunt</a> <a href="https://t.co/20K0tvLc9F">pic.twitter.com/20K0tvLc9F</a></p> <p>— のあ (@Noa_Kyogre) <a href="https://twitter.com/Noa_Kyogre/status/2020371004934221837?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">February 8, 2026</a></p></blockquote>  <p><span>So, if you want to Shiny hunt these outfits, you’ll have to reload and fight through these battles over and over just to get one of them. That wasn’t enough for Noa_Kyogre, who has collected the full set of six, not once but twice, and asserts they are the first person to do so. The double dipping came from finding the full set in both the Japanese and international versions of the game.</span></p>

 <p><span>It’s definitely worth the bragging rights, but is it worth the likely insanity you’ll subject yourself to in order to get it? Probably not, and Noa_Kyogre says they will </span><a href="https://x.com/Noa_Kyogre/status/2020382448736207114?s=20"><span>never do it again</span></a><span>. I’m surprised they didn’t come to that conclusion the first time through.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><i><span>Pokémon Battle Revolution </span></i><span>was pretty maligned back in the day for being more of a battle simulator than a full-blown game, but it does still have some of the </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-battle-revolution-animations-wii-scarlet-violet-1850362666"><span>best animations of the series’ 3D games</span></a><span>. It really captured each monster’s personality in a way that doesn’t come across in games like </span><i><span>Scarlet </span></i><span>and </span><i><span>Violet</span></i><span>, but it also had the benefit of a much smaller Pokémon selection than most modern games. </span><i><span>Pokémon Champions</span></i><span>, the Switch and mobile battle simulator </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-champions-legends-z-a-presents-day-stream-1851766818"><span>coming later this year</span></a><span>, is essentially its spiritual successor, and will act as the battle platform for competitive </span><i><span>Pokémon </span></i><span>moving forward.</span></p>

            <title><![CDATA[The Binding Of Isaac Dev’s New Game Takes 500 Hours To Complete And Will Take Players ‘Months or Years’ To Find All Of Its Secrets]]></title>
            <link>https://kotaku.com/mewgenics-completionist-secrets-hours-binding-isaac-roguelike-2000667343</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><span>On Tuesday, </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/mewgenics-edmund-mcmillen-roguelike-impressions-2000666865"><i><span>Mewgenics</span></i></a><span>, the tactical RPG-slash-life-sim roguelite about breeding and battling cats, created by developers behind </span><i><span>The Binding of Isaac </span></i><span>and </span><i><span>Closure</span></i><span>, launched and almost immediately shot to the top of Steam’s charts. </span><i><span>Mewgenics </span></i><span>seems like it’s shaping up to be the next big hit for roguelite sickos, in no small part thanks to how absolutely massive its scope is.</span></p> <p><span>In </span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/SteamDeck/comments/1qzfwae/edmund_mcmillen_here_mewgenics_is_steam_deck/"><span>an AMA on the Steam Deck subreddit</span></a><span> over the weekend, developers Edmund McMillen and Tyler Glaiel teamed up to answer fans’ questions about the game, and they revealed that it’s a </span><i><span>lot </span></i><span>larger than anyone previously expected. In one response, McMillen referred to the game as “one of the largest tactical RPGs of all time.” In another, he revealed that “it will take an average player about 200+ hours to ‘beat the game’ and 500+ hours to 100% :)” (thanks, </span><em><a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/roguelike/its-going-to-take-you-over-500-hours-to-100-percent-complete-mewgenics-according-to-creator-edmund-mcmillen/"><span>PC Gamer</span></a></em><span>).</span></p>

 <p><span>Judging by the game’s 281 Steam achievements and the fact that it has 1,000 unique abilities to unlock, that estimate doesn’t sound like much of a stretch. And it seems like </span><i><span>Mewgenics</span></i><span>’ most dedicated players might end up pouring quite a few extra hours into hunting for secrets. According to Glaiel, “there’s a lot of little things that I think people will be discovering for months or years. But we will reserve the true ARG level stuff for DLC.” (thanks, </span><em><a href="https://www.polygon.com/mewgenics-dlc-secret-unlock-arg-binding-of-issac/"><span>Polygon</span></a></em><span>).</span></p> <p><span>While the base game’s absurd length should tide players over for a long time, McMillen also said the team is planning on beginning work on the game’s DLC in the next few months, with a planned release around a year later. McMillen also hinted that a Switch 2 port might be on its way. The game is currently only available on PC.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <h2>From delayed development to the top of the charts</h2> <p><i><span>Mewgenics </span></i><span>was announced all the way back in 2012, but the project entered a long period of development hell (and was even cancelled at one point). Despite the game’s wildly tumultuous development cycle, it’s </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/mewgenics-edmund-mcmillen-roguelike-impressions-2000666865"><span>apparently pretty good</span></a><span>. It’s currently the <a href="https://www.metacritic.com/browse/game/all/all/current-year/">highest-rated game</a> on Metacritic for the year so far. If <em>Binding of Isaac</em>‘s trajectory <a href="https://kotaku.com/binding-of-isaac-designers-new-game-is-both-uncomfortab-1728533526">is any indication</a>, this is only the start of a long and wild post-launch life for <em>Mewgenics</em>.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><span>I haven’t had a chance to pick up the game yet, but I’ve been having a blast watching players share their freakish findings online all day. Even McMillen couldn’t resist sharing some of his own discoveries in the AMA—he wrote: “my nephew Eli had one where he could punch one of his other cats in the face and it would send out 1000 sparkles to totally destroy all enemies instantly…the game is so insane man, you don’t even know.”</span></p>

              <p><em>Arc Raiders</em> devs are assessing the damage from an ongoing duplication glitch before they decide how to respond. <a href="https://kotaku.com/all-of-besiege-beaten-with-a-single-perfect-machine-1688320789">Ten years later</a>, <em>Besieged</em> still has new content coming. And <em>Marvel Tokon: Fighting Souls</em> isn’t skimping on its fighting game roster at launch. It’s the latest edition of Morning Checkpoint, <em>Kotaku</em>‘s daily roundup of gaming news, rumors, and culture.</p> <p>Bryan Dechart, the actor who played Connor in <em>Detroit: Become Human</em>, might be <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/samitron.bsky.social/post/3mehke7eta22r">teasing fans with the threat</a> of a sequel. Quantic Dream has announced a live-service MOBA called <i>Spellcasters Chronicles </i>and a <em>Star Wars</em> game called <em>Star Wars Eclipse</em>, but it’s now been almost eight years since it last shipped something. Maybe in the <em>Detroit</em> sequel the humans will try to become AI instead of the other way around. Or maybe Dechart is just trying to get <a href="https://x.com/BryanDechart/status/2020873211286528029">more subscribers on Twitch</a>.</p>   <h2>A duplication glitch taking over <em>Arc Raiders</em> gets an emergency fix</h2> <p>Embark Studios has been playing <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ArcRaiders/comments/1r0x0i7/just_a_heads_up_before_you_check_the_patch_notes/">whack-a-mole with this exploit</a> for a couple of weeks now and it’s taking its toll. Players can essentially duplicate any item in the game that their character can hold, leading to <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ArcRaiders/comments/1qq36np/12m_loot_in_one_raid_killed_a_guy_with_this_loot/">inventory screens</a> that all look hacked. Today’s big &nbsp;1.15.0 patch didn’t include anything addressing the issue, but Embark ended up rushing out a hotfix just hours later.</p>

 <p>“We have just pushed a hotfix to resolve the current duplication issue. We are still actively monitoring the situation to ensure we’ve covered all cases – should you encounter other duplication issues, please raise them to us in the bug report channel,” the development team wrote on Discord. “We are still investigating the full impact of the issue, and will be taking action based on the severity of the different cases as we complete our investigation.”</p> <h2>A group of <em>Valheim</em> devs have a demo for their next game</h2> <p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FPMxYZAlpPU"><em>Begraved</em> is a medieval PVE looter</a> from some of the developers who made the hit Viking survival crafting sim. Think a co-op dungeon crawler with extraction shooter elements. It now has <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/4113160/Begraved/">a free demo</a> for players to try on Steam ahead of its upcoming Early Access launch.</p>

 <h2>Hit medieval destruction sim <em>Besiege</em> goes to space</h2>  <p>The unusual physics sandbox arrived a decade ago, only hit 1.0 on Steam five years ago, and is still heading to new frontiers.<em> Besiege: The Broken Beyond</em> will hit Steam sometime around mid-2026 and add a new campaign, environment, mechanics, and blocks.</p>

 <h2><em>Marvel Tokon: Fighting Souls</em> will feature 20 comic book characters at launch</h2> <p>That number <a href="https://www.resetera.com/threads/marvel-tokon-steams-page-has-been-updated-revealing-roster-size-20-characters-at-launch-single-player-mode-64-player-lobbies-psn-acc-required.1430548/">leaked on Steam</a> ahead of this week’s PlayStation Showcase. <a href="https://kotaku.com/three-things-we-learned-about-the-coolest-looking-marvel-fighting-game-in-years-2000614384">Arc System Works’ riff on the <em>Marvel vs. Capcom</em> formula</a> has already confirmed eight of its roster members, including Captain America, Doom, and Iron Man. It’s very light on <em>X-Men</em> characters at the moment so maybe the upcoming State of Play will reveal Magneto and others are joining the fray.</p> <h2><em>Until Dawn</em> studio Supermassive reveals a new release date for its next game</h2> <p>Upcoming horror release <em>Directive 8020</em> was supposed to be out last year but ended up getting a long delay. It’s now resurfaced with <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61OMILUgVyo">a new trailer</a> and a May 12 launch date. Hopefully it marks a turnaround from <a href="https://gameinformer.com/news/2024/01/18/dead-by-daylight-studio-behaviour-interactive-has-reportedly-laid-off-45-people">the very rough last few years</a> the studio’s been through.</p>

 <h2>A <em>Marathon</em> hands-on leak out of China sounds very positive</h2> <p>Bungie’s extraction shooter <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GamingLeaksAndRumours/comments/1r0wp7k/marathon_handson_event_in_china_impressions_leaked/">reportedly had a recent test event there</a> that went very well. General impressions summarized in a <a href="https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1JCcPzYEov/">video posted on Bilibili</a> suggest a lot more depth and tension than the original alpha test in early 2025 conveyed. We’ll probably get a closer look at the worldbuilding and lore in a new State of Play trailer this week.</p> <h2>ICYMI:</h2> <ul> <li><strong><a href="https://kotaku.com/super-bowl-60-ads-celebs-stars-ben-affleck-dunkin-jurassic-park-ai-de-aged-best-commericals-2000666913">How did Super Bowl ads get so cringe?&nbsp;</a></strong></li> <li><strong><a href="https://kotaku.com/the-best-thing-about-the-winter-olympics-are-the-drone-cameras-2000666958">The best thing about the Winter Olympics are the drone cameras</a></strong></li> <li><strong><a href="https://kotaku.com/mewgenics-edmund-mcmillen-roguelike-impressions-2000666865">The latest roguelike from Binding of Isaac’s creator is a brilliantly poopy take on strategy&nbsp;</a></strong></li> </ul> <h2>Watch this:</h2>
