However, a deal was never struck and it seemed like the film was destined to never see the light of day. But now a new report says a deal is in the works that could lead to <em>Coyote Vs. Acme</em> be released. </p><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://deadline.com/2025/03/coyote-vs-acme-movie-deal-sale-warner-bros-ketchup-1236329381/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://deadline.com/2025/03/coyote-vs-acme-movie-deal-sale-warner-bros-ketchup-1236329381/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">On March 19, <em>Deadline </em>reported</a></span> that Warner Bros. was negotiating a deal to sell the film to small media company Ketchup Entertainment, which will reportedly acquire it for $50 million, assuming the deal is finalized and gets across the finish line.

That film was also canned by WB in August 2022 before it was saved by Ketchup who stepped in and purchased it. The movie has since earned over $5.5 million in theaters with no virtually no marketing. </p><p>Hopefully, assuming this deal is completed, <em>Coyote Vs.
