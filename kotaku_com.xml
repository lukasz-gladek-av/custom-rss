              <p>Manufacturers of laptops have been working on making thinner and lighter laptops for years, and the byproduct of that is necessarily diminishing the amount of ports. You no longer need to deal with a string of ports for HDMI, SD cards, etc. That’s why carrying a USB‑C hub is now essentially a requirement, especially if you own a MacBook or a thin Windows laptop. This Acer <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4201/">7‑in‑1 USB‑C hub is the gap filler and now it costs a record low of $17 (down from $24) on Amazon</a>.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4201/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>A Little Hub That Widens Your Laptop’s World</h2>
<p>What this hub basically does is give your laptop the versatility that’s been taken away from it by manufacturers: Plug it into one USB‑C port and <strong>you’ve got seven handy connections at your fingertips</strong>. There are <strong>two fast USB‑A 3.1 ports</strong> for keyboard and external drives and <strong>two</strong> <strong>further USB‑C data ports</strong> capable of transfer speeds of up to 5Gbps. There’s even a <strong>full-size HDMI output</strong> to feed 4K video at 30Hz or Full HD at 1080p which makes it easy to plug in to monitors, projectors, or even your TV.</p>



<p>Through its Power Delivery port, this<strong> Acer hub can pass through up to 100W of power</strong> which is enough to keep a MacBook Pro charged while you’re running everything else at once. That means no worrying about draining your laptop mid‑presentation or mid‑flight. If you’ve ever been stuck unplugging accessories just to keep your laptop alive, this hub solves that daily frustration.</p>
<p>For photographers, content creators, or anyone who still uses SD cards in cameras and drones,<strong> the MicroSD and SD ports are a lifesaver</strong>. You do not need to carry extra adapters to transfer files directly into your laptop. The hub itself is housed in a rugged aluminum casing which protects it from damage and keeps it cool when used extensively.</p>
<p>It works with MacBooks, Windows laptops, ChromeOS, Linux, and even gaming systems like the Nintendo Switch or Steam Deck. If your tablet supports Samsung’s DeX mode, it turns your portable device into a desktop‑style setup with a display and peripherals connected through this hub. In practice, that means one tiny accessory can unlock a huge boost in productivity whether you’re working from home, commuting, or even gaming on the go.</p>
<p>And for just $17, this Acer 7‑in‑1 hub is like one of those rare upgrades that are worth it the moment you connect it.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>In the span of about 20 seconds and with just a single Discord ping, Rockstar Games got 65,000+ people, nearly all of whom are waiting for<em> Grand Theft Auto 6</em>‘s launch, very excited and then crushed their hopes, dreams, and happiness.</p> <p>On September 19, at precisely 3:20 p.m. EST, Rockstar Games posted a single message in the <em>GTA Online</em> section of the <a href="https://kotaku.com/gta-6-rockstar-game-official-discord-server-launched-1851762536">company’s official Discord server</a>. The message was simply Rockstar Games acknowledging a bug involving a <em>GTA Online</em> weekly challenge that was supposed to unlock a piece of in-game clothing for those who completed it, but wasn’t working properly. Pretty basic <em>GTA Online</em> update. But for some reason, <a href="https://discord.com/channels/618327687701725194/1299025718440759357/1418678232735158292">Rockstar Games followed that message up with an “@here.”</a> They did this in a server with 68,097 members. Uh oh!</p> <figure id="attachment_2000627266" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000627266"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000627266">©Kotaku / Rockstar Games</figcaption></figure> <p>For those who don’t use Discord, dropping “@here” pings everyone in the server channel unless they specifically opt out of notifications. And most people don’t do that, especially not in Rockstar’s Discord server, where desperate fans cling to the hope that at any time, the studio could drop a new trailer for <em><a href="https://kotaku.com/grand-theft-auto-6-gta-vi-new-trailer-gameplay-story-1851779368">GTA 6.</a>&nbsp;</em> Rockstar Games has also not really done this before. So that random “@here” instantly caused around 68,000 fans to freak the fuck out. Making matters worse is that for many, myself included, the notification simply appeared as “Rockstar Games – @here” with no further context.</p> <p>I’ll fully admit that when I first saw it, I assumed the company was making some big random announcement about<em> GTA 6</em>. Instead, what I found when I opened Discord was a lot of confused, sad, and angry fans who weren’t sure why Rockstar had done this to them all. “Why!” “Whattt?” “Shut up!” “WTF?!” “No GTA 6??” “Stop it!” and “HOLY SHIT WHY” were just some of the hundreds and hundreds of messages that whizzed by my eyes when I opened Discord shortly after the ping.</p> <p>I’ve reached out to Rockstar Games about the Discord ping and why it decided to do this. But whatever the reason, it won’t change the fact that for a brief and chaotic moment, 65,000+ people went wild thinking they were about to watch a new<em> GTA 6</em> trailer or get news of another delay. Nope. There’s no new trailer or other big announcement, and <a href="https://kotaku.com/gta6-grand-theft-auto-6-release-date-delay-may-2026-1851778799"><em>GTA 6</em> is still set to launch in May of next year</a>.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/this-140w-laptop-power-bank-is-a-dream-buy-now-that-amazon-has-it-back-at-black-friday-price-2000627209</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/this-140w-laptop-power-bank-is-a-dream-buy-now-that-amazon-has-it-back-at-black-friday-price.1302972/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>There are thousands of power banks on Amazon, but most of them fall between 5W and 60W. That is fine if all you do is charge a phone but when it comes to laptops and bigger devices, they are not much use. The <strong>Anker 737 power bank is in a league of its own</strong> and it is able to charge nearly everything you own – the new iPhone or a MacBook. And right now, <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4200/">Amazon has cut it down to $87 (from $109), an all-time low price under the $100 threshold</a>, which is why that it is currently the best-selling product in its category.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4200/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>The Power Bank That Charges Everything</h2>
<p>At the core of the Anker 737 lies its huge capacity and speed: Carrying a <strong>gargantuan 24,000mAh battery</strong>, it has the juice to charge an iPhone 17 Pro from zero all the way up more than four times. Need to charge an iPad Pro or a MacBook? It can do that too, more than once over so you will not be scrambling to find an outlet on road trips. The difference from an average power bank is noticeable day one, because with them you usually need to ration juice.</p>



<p>And there’s the speed: The 737 model <strong>supports 140W fast charging via Power Delivery 3.1</strong>, something that’s usually reserved for laptop-only charger like devices. This lets you go from nearly dead, empty MacBook to usable in a hurry even when you’ve got other devices along for the ride. To get that kind of speed, you’ll need a 5A USB-C cable and a hefty 140W wall adapter to get the job done. But once you’ve got that, the experience is silky.</p>
<p>Another clever thing is the clever display on the device: Instead of guessing how much battery you have remaining or when you’ll be ready to go again, the digital readout on the screen shows real-time figures like power in and out and an estimate of time remaining to charge. For those who are lugging a number of devices, that sort of openness spares heartache and allows you to plan more effectively.</p>
<p>Yes, portability matters, and despite all its muscle, the Anker 737 still fits into a bag. It’s about 6 inches long and 22 ounces, so it’s easily portable on a vacation and, most importantly, does fit under TSA guidelines for carry-on luggage. That means you can bring it on a plane without any problem, which isn’t the case with most large power banks.</p>



<p><strong>Three charging ports (two USB-C and one USB-A)</strong> mean that you can charge a few devices at once so you charge a laptop, phone, and earbuds at the same time instead of switching between them. That sort of freedom when you’re fully powered is what sets the Anker 737 power bank apart from the sea of tiny batteries that only get to keep one or two devices charged gradually. Add on top of that Anker’s excellent two-year warranty and many-year record of customer service, and there’s reassurance in the box.</p>
<p>Power banks are everywhere, but power banks like this one are not. If your definition of peace of mind is never running out of juice on your most important devices, now is the time to buy one.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/roborock-doesnt-want-you-fighting-housework-anymore-its-selling-its-latest-model-with-no-margin-2000627205</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/roborock-doesn%E2%80%99t-want-you-struggling-with-housework-it%E2%80%99s-selling-its-latest-model-with-no-margin.1302957/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Budget robot vacuum cleaners have three huge complaints. One, they’re never powerful enough so there’s always still some dust and some crumbs left behind. Two, they usually do mopping not so great so you’re left with streaks or worse still, no way to mop. And three, they need constant maintenance because you have to empty them almost every run. The <strong>Roborock Qrevo S5V</strong>, launched this summer, fixes all of that in one lean machine. Even better, <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4199/">Amazon knocked it down to only $549 (from $899), its lowest price yet, which makes it a deal worth paying attention</a>.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4199/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Solves Your Daily Hassles</h2>
<p>The new Roborock Qrevo S5V is all about sheer cleaning power: <strong>Its 12,000Pa HyperForce suction</strong> is several times stronger than many budget models which means it lifts stubborn dirt from rugs, carpets and hard floors. If you’ve struggled with pet hair tangling inside brushes, this model is certified to end that frustration. Roborock uses a floating rubber main brush designed to resist tangles, combined with an arc-shaped side brush that sweeps along edges while avoiding hair buildup.</p>



<p>Mopping is no afterthought here, either. Instead of a single plate scratching the floor, the<strong> FlexiArm design includes two turning mop pads</strong>. They turn around 200 times per minute to buff out stains, down into corners and chair legs. The arm goes so far that the pads can swing into spaces other robots cannot cover. In addition, the mop lifts automatically 10 millimeters when it drives over carpets so you never have soggy rugs. You can control water flow through 30 levels using the companion app to accommodate any floor surfaces, from delicate wood to hard tile.</p>
<p>Then there is the dock which is essentially having an assistant built-in: The device isn’t just dumping the dustbin into a large bin <strong>capable of holding seven weeks’ worth of garbage</strong>. The device also washes the mop pads with clean water and dries them with warm air so that they don’t smell. You won’t have to top it up as frequently either since the dock will charge the water tank in the robot automatically, giving it enough to clean a massive 3,500 square feet on one fill.</p>



<p>Navigation is accomplished by Roborock through LiDAR scanning: It <strong>maps rooms 360 degrees</strong> and then plans effective cleaning routes. If you have a multi-level house, it remembers up to four different floor plans and auto-switches as needed. Structured light sensors have obstacle avoidance, so it won’t chomp toy cars, run into cables, or get stuck under chair legs. In the app, you can even define no-go zones when you know a space is too messy.</p>
<p>For a record-low price of $549, the Qrevo S5V positions itself in a very desirable spot. Numerous competitors within the category either skip better mopping, compromise on suction, or lack a good self-maintenance dock. If you’ve been waiting for a vacuum and mop combo that truly reduces cleaning stress, this is the most convincing deal so far.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/cyberpunk-2-online-multiplayer-witcher-4-sequel-cdpr-2000627198</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/cyberpunk-2077-sequel-experimenting-with-multiplayer-as-cdpr-embraces-online-gameplay.1302924/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Asymmetric mercenary leaderboards? Co-op heists? A full-blown<em> GTA Online</em>-style live-service component? The multiplayer possibilities for <a href="https://kotaku.com/cyberpunk-2-release-date-witcher-4-rpg-cdpr-1851782750">a <em>Cyberpunk 2077</em> sequel</a> are easy to imagine, even if they’re hard to implement. A new job posting at CD Projekt Red suggests the studio is at least flirting with some sort of online component for its next sci-fi open-world RPG. It’s a small and noncommittal data point that’s nevertheless part of a larger trend.</p> <p>“Lead your team to develop and optimize multiplayer systems, including matchmaking, and address challenges related to latency, bandwidth usage, and server performance,” reads <a href="https://www.cdprojektred.com/en/jobs/20217-lead-network-engineer">part of the job description</a>, <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/cyberpunk-2077-sequel-looks-set-to-include-multiplayer-years-after-cyberpunk-2077-online-mode-scrapped">first spotted by <em>IGN,</em></a>&nbsp;for a new engineering role at CDPR’s Boston-based satellite studio leading development on <em>Cyberpunk 2</em>. That ambition gestures toward plans the studio originally had for adding multiplayer to the first game. Plans for that content were later set aside or abandoned as CDPR rushed to prioritize the stability and long-term viability of <em>Cyberpunk 2077</em> after a disastrous 2020 launch.</p> <p>Will history repeat itself, or is multiplayer coming to the world of <em>Cyberpunk </em>for real this time? With the big-budget blockbuster still in pre-production as CDPR focuses on <em>The Witcher 4</em>, it’s impossible to say. But it’s clear the Poland-based company has been looking to experiment with multiplayer for some time now. CDPR told investors it was looking to bring “online gameplay” to more of its franchises in a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIAiGI-v6Y8">strategy briefing</a> four years ago, and co-CEO Michał Nowakowski <a href="https://kotaku.com/cyberpunk-2077-sequel-orion-multiplayer-1851190429#:~:text=Kotaku%20reached%20out%20to%20CDPR%20for%20comment.&amp;text=Badowski%20and%20Nowakowski's%20comments%20on,works%20that%20we%20know%20of.">told<em> Reuters</em> last year</a> the team was “considering” bringing multiplayer to the next <em>Cyberpunk</em>.</p>

 <p>CDPR has also already confirmed at least one multiplayer project: a <em>Witcher</em> spin-off codenamed <em>Project</em> <em>Sirius</em>. That game has been in prolonged development at what used to be called The Molasses Flood, with layoffs, departures, and design pivots reportedly all taking their toll. The studio was officially absorbed into the rest of CDPR earlier this year. “Overall, it shows a very bright future for Project Sirius (aka ‘the multiplayer Witcher game,’ of which I was the Design Director for three years),” Molasses Flood co-founder Damian Isla wrote upon leaving <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/damian-isla-815a46_well-its-the-end-of-an-era-tucked-away-activity-7315404560620044288-Qazy/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=member_desktop&amp;rcm=ACoAAAoO_OkB-VfPR7dhiZ-PZ-9sf_EfWliEy1k">back in March</a>. “It’s going to be an amazing game, one for the books, and I cannot wait until the rest of the world learns about what we’ve been working on.”</p> <p>One does not simply pivot to making an online multiplayer game any more than one simply walks into Mordor. CDPR’s own struggles with going from the third-person perspective of <em>Witcher 3</em> to the first-person<em> Cyberpunk 2077</em> speak to the tech and design difficulties inherent in taking on new development challenges. But it would be cool to see what CDPR can achieve if it takes that next leap. It ultimately worked out in the end for the studio’s last game, even if it took an extra three years after it came out.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/this-iphone-gimbal-costs-peanuts-amazon-is-clearing-out-djis-budget-model-2000627191</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/this-iphone-gimbal-costs-peanuts-amazon-is-clearing-out-dji%E2%80%99s-budget-model.1302918/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Smartphones are incredible cameras in our pockets with the capability of capturing crisp snaps and 4K video, but there’s a further issue: <strong>shaky footage</strong>. If you’ve ever tried to film a birthday moment, a journey moment or a TikTok dance, then you’ll know how frustrating shaky video is. So, that’s why gimbals exist.</p>
<p>The DJI Osmo Mobile SE gets rid of that problem and you’re able to turn ordinary recordings into professional-quality videos that look as if they’re shot by pros. And since <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4198/">Amazon has dropped the price to just $58 (down from a previous low of $69)</a> — its lowest price ever — this is the perfect time to pick one up.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4198/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Why This Gimbal Is Worth It</h2>
<p>The Osmo Mobile SE is <strong>DJI’s lowest-priced stabilizer</strong> but cheap doesn’t have to mean bare bones. In real life, it’s the category leader simply because it distills pro-level video stabilization into an accessible package. Its folding design means you can shove it neatly into a backpack but when you unfold it and clip your phone onto the magnetic clamp, you’re getting that liquid-smooth footage artists adore right away. It’s <strong>compatible with both iPhones and Androids</strong>, so compatibility issues are out of the question.</p>



<p>One of the real game changers in this regard is ActiveTrack 6.0: In essence, this <strong>permits the gimbal to automatically follow your subject</strong>. If you’re filming your children playing in the park or your dog running around on the beach, the Osmo Mobile SE holds them in frame without you scrambling for controls. It even works well for solo creators: just set the phone up, get in frame and let the gimbal take center stage in your own video. The DJI Mimo app also adds to those capabilities and offers Smart templates and shot ideas that help you get more cinematic with less effort.</p>
<p>Another intelligent aspect is that it allows pairing with an Apple Watch and gives you a remote in your wrist. Tilt, pan, or begin recording without needing to rush back to your phone. For vloggers, that is a real boost for how you record hands‑free. Throw in quick editing using the LightCut app which contains easy-to-use templates and your raw shots start looking like mini-movies to share in minutes.</p>



<p>And then the real magic: <strong>3-axis stabilization</strong>. DJI’s algorithm reacts in real time to eliminate jitters and bumps that ruin handheld video. Walking down urban streets, backpacking a path or merely shooting a travel blog at an airport, the video is stable and watchable. You can even switch between landscape shooting for cinematic use or portrait mode for social media updates with a single click of a button. And if you wish to get creative, the gimbal comes with<strong> various modes including Follow, Tilt Lock, FPV and Spin Shot</strong>&nbsp;which each unlock various artistic possibilities.</p>
<p>For a paltry $58, this deal is hard to hype. Most gimbals with this much stabilization and tracking tech run more, but DJI somehow crammed it all into a lightweight, tiny device for creators. Over 10,000 people bought it last month alone, and <strong>over 10,000 reviewers left it an average 4.5‑star rating</strong>. That should tell you everything you need to know about how dependable and adaptable it is.</p>

              <p>The community manager for the popular and controversial online SWAT simulator <em>Ready Or Not </em>was fired after posting in the game’s official Discord server that “nothing of value was lost” following the <a href="https://kotaku.com/charlie-kirk-shooter-steam-library-valve-discord-radicalization-2000626897">recent assassination of conservative commentator Charlie Kirk</a>.</p> <p>On or around September 17, <em>Ready Or Not’s</em> community manager, known online as Kaminsky, was asked to add “Charlie Kirk” and a few variations of the name to the server’s list of filtered words. Kaminsky confirmed they had done so, but then shared their own personal thoughts about Kirk, who was murdered at a speaking event on September 10 in Utah. The community manager posted:</p> <blockquote><p>“Funny you mention that because me and my roomate are literally just talking about him getting shot. All I have to say is: Nothing of value was lost.”</p></blockquote> <p>Screenshots and posts of this comment <a href="https://x.com/KayfabeMediaYT/status/1968548146398609603/photo/1">were quickly shared online</a> by fans of Kirk and right-wing content creators, with many demanding that Void Interactive fire the manager.&nbsp; And that’s exactly what Void did.</p>

 <p><a href="https://bsky.app/profile/airbagged.bsky.social/post/3lz7e5vzadc2w">On Friday</a>, a Void Interactive representative confirmed in<em> Ready Or Not</em>‘s official Discord server that the studio had “ended” its “relationship” with Kaminsky. It’s unclear if the community manager was a full-time employee or a volunteer.&nbsp; Before the news was official, fans had spotted that Kaminisky, often referred to as Kam online, <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/airbagged.bsky.social/post/3lz5esqafws2e">was no longer listed</a> as being a part of the server. One Discord user in the game’s server <a href="https://discord.com/channels/310075021882294272/452425840274309120/1418631175823687750">claimed</a> that a sticker emoji featuring Kaminsky had also been removed.</p> <p><em>Kotaku</em> reached out to Void Interactive for comment. Kaminsky could not immediately be contacted.</p>

 <p>“To Our <em>Ready or Not</em> Community, We are aware of comments made by our community manager about a recent tragic event,” posted Void Interactive rep Gerby on Discord.&nbsp; “These statements do not reflect our values or represent our company. We have ended our relationship with this individual and reminded our team of the responsibility we all share when communicating on public platforms. Our focus remains on fostering a respectful and professional community around <em>Ready or Not.</em>”</p> <p>This isn’t the first video game industry employee to lose their job after saying the wrong thing about Kirk’s recent murder. Last week, <a href="https://kotaku.com/ghost-yotei-charlie-kirk-joke-playstation-sony-2000625478">a developer working on<em> Ghost of Yotei</em> was fired by Sony</a> after making a joke about Kirk’s alleged assassin. <a href="https://kotaku.com/charlie-kirk-shooter-discord-politics-helldivers-memes-2000626029">The alleged killer’s connection to video games</a> has become a big part of the story around Kirk’s murder, with reports that some of the assassin’s bullets had messages etched into them <a href="https://kotaku.com/charlie-kirk-shooter-helldivers-bullet-engraving-2000625439">referencing <em>Helldivers 2</em>.</a> Meanwhile, <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2025/09/17/charlie-kirk-jimmy-kimmel-abc-disney.html">ABC late-night host Jimmy Kimmel is also facing pressure</a> to apologize after comments he made about Kirk got his show pulled “indefinitely” on Thursday.</p> <p><em><strong>Updated: 9/19/2025, 3:30 p.m. ET:</strong></em>&nbsp;When asked for further comment, Void Interactive PR pointed <em>Kotaku</em> to the studio’s previously mentioned statement, which has <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1144200/view/517473296253453455">also been posted on <em>Ready or Not</em>‘s Steam page</a>.</p>
