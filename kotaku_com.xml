              <p>The Nintendo Direct that fans have been waiting for is finally here and it’s a big one. September is usually when the company has its annual blowout showcase, and after a messy first half of 2025 ahead of the Switch 2 launch, it seems like we might be getting back into a familiar flow. After a quiet couple of years, the drought may finally be over. The Switch 2 is out and Nintendo can finally wheel out the big guns.</p> <p>With Nintendo promising an hour-long livestream, <a href="https://kotaku.com/nintendo-direct-september-12-mario-metroid-prime-4-2000624629">the September 12 Direct</a> will be the longest in the company’s history outside of the April one earlier this year for revealing the Switch 2 hardware. It also comes just ahead of the 40th anniversary of <em>Super Mario Bros.</em> on September 13, suggesting plenty of Mario-themed announcements may be in tow as well. And then there’s the flurry of recently leaks from self-proclaimed insiders, some with a good enough track record to take them seriously going into the event. Here’s what we’re likely to see at the latest Nintendo Direct this Friday, from rumors and best guesses to some wild longshots that are too cool not to think about.</p> <h2><em>Resident Evil</em>, <em>Final Fantasy VII Rebirth</em>, and more ports</h2> <p>According to <em>Resident Evil</em> <a href="https://twitter.com/AestheticGamer1/status/1965424695731478833?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1965424695731478833%7Ctwgr%5E6786e5247f19b31b1c73c98ae9cc0dc0eabda24e%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fkotaku.com%2Fa-bunch-of-resident-evil-games-are-reportedly-getting-switch-2-ports-2000624442">leaker Dusk Golem,</a> we should expect a whole lot of Capcom’s horror series to be coming to Switch 2 in the year ahead. That includes <em>Resident Evil 7 </em>and&nbsp;<em>Resident Evil Village</em>, as well as the <em>Resident Evil 2</em>,<em> 3</em>, and<em> 4</em> remakes. Notably, all of these were created on the current RE Engine, which Capcom has been using for all of its new games. Dusk Golem has suggested the newest sequel,<em> Resident Evil: Requiem</em>, will arrive on Switch 2 at some point as well.</p>

 <p>While only a port of<em> RE7</em> has been claimed to be getting revealed at this week’s Direct, fans have already started speculating about what this will mean for Capcom’s other franchises on Switch 2. Both <em>Dragon’s Dogma 2</em> and <em>Monster Hunter Wilds</em> were also developed in the RE Engine, as was <em>Street Fighter 6</em> which was a launch game for the hardware back in June.</p> <p><em>Final Fantasy VII Remake</em> <a href="https://kotaku.com/ff7-switch-2-remake-framerate-final-fantasy-2000622094">isn’t out on Switch 2 yet</a>, but there are already rumors that <em>Rebirth</em> isn’t far behind. Reliable Switch leaker NateTheHate <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GamingLeaksAndRumours/comments/1n9qetv/comment/ncoma6b/">recently claimed</a> the sequel is headed to Nintendo’s new console sometime in 2026. He’s also previously reported that <a href="https://kotaku.com/switch-2-nintendo-direct-july-mario-red-dead-2-1851786219"><em>Red Dead Redemption 2</em> is being ported</a> to Switch 2, which seems likely to arrive sooner than later. That doesn’t mean either will be at this week’s Direct but they are certainly in the mix. There are rumors that<em> Starfield</em> and <em>Assassin’s Creed Shadows</em> will end up on Nintendo’s handheld hybrid at some point, too.</p>

 <p>Then there’s a <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GamingLeaksAndRumours/comments/1n9qetv/comment/ncoma6b/">very messy riddle from leaker SwitchForce</a> who was the first to reveal that a Nintendo Direct was happening on September 12. The tease is that there will be three games at the showcase with the number seven in the title. Outside of<em> FF7</em>, there’s been speculation about <em>Call of Duty: Black Ops 7</em> and <em>Ace Attorney 7</em> being the others, though SwitchForce said the long-running courtroom series <a href="https://xcancel.com/INRamos13/status/1964543031216157045?t=jnplNfO2lqZpB6lvD7zsoQ&amp;s=19">definitely wouldn’t be in the livestream</a>. A more obvious choice is<em> 007 First Light</em>, which was recently at the PlayStation State of Play as well.</p> <h2>The year of <em>Super Mario Bros.&nbsp;</em></h2> <p>SwitchForce has also been teasing big Mario news at the event. “They buy the new systems for the mustache,” <a href="https://x.com/TheSwitchForce/status/1965782433674199051">read a tweet</a> featuring a GIF of Mario from <em>Super Mario Odyssey</em>. One theory is that the <em>Odyssey</em> team split in two, with a younger offshoot working on <em>Donkey Kong Bananza</em> and another developing the next 3D <em>Mario</em> game. The timing makes the reveal of<em> Super Mario Odyssey</em>‘s successor feel all but assured, though it probably won’t be the only Mario announcement in the Direct.</p>

 <p>We’re also less than a year out from <em>The Super Mario Bros. Movie 2</em> with no real info about what the story will be or which celebrities will be joining the English-language cast. At least an initial teaser, if not a full-blown trailer, could be in the cards. Maybe we’ll even get a double feature with a tease for the upcoming <em>Zelda</em> movie in 2027 as well? It could be as simple as confirmation of whether it will be a brand-new story or not, or whether it will be another isekai tale (people from the real world magically appearing in Hyrule).</p> <p>But back to Mario. It’s his time to shine after all. The way Nintendo usually likes to handle these anniversaries means we could get a new anthology of remasters or remixes of older games in the series, or ports of more recent entries that have been languishing on old hardware like <em>Super Mario Galaxy</em>&nbsp;(I’m still holding out hope for <em>Super Mario Galaxy 3</em> myself). Another Switch Online exclusive multiplayer spin-off like<em> Super Mario Bros. 35</em> doesn’t sound out of the question either. Maybe this time it’ll go from 2D side-scrolling to a <em>Fall Guys</em>-style 3D battle royale mode.</p>

 <p>Finally, we know Nintendo loves its limited-edition accessories and merchandise. A <em>Mario Bros. </em>40th anniversary Switch 2, new Amiibo, and new Switch 2 Joy-Con colors feel like an easy prediction. More exciting would be some new sort of dedicated device like the Nintendo Game &amp; Watch: Super Mario Bros., only this time with more than just the first two games. And what’s going on with that <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/nintendos-detachable-dual-screen-patent-has-been-updated/">detachable dual-screen add-on</a> that Nintendo patented? Could the Switch 2 finally get DS games coming to its subscription service?</p> <h2><em>Xenoblade Chronicles 2</em> deserves a Switch 2 upgrade</h2> <p>If the original Switch taught us anything, it’s that Nintendo loves double-dipping. Half of the first-party library for that console was just Wii U games. And I fully expect the company to maintain that pattern with Switch 2 by continuing to roll out free and paid upgrades for older games. A recent Monolith Soft job posting on social media included <a href="https://x.com/SoSnake13/status/1959893819190824996#m">fresh footage of <em>Xenoblade Chronicles 2</em></a> that appeared to show it running at a much higher resolution. Those open-world RPGs have always struggled on the first Switch, leaving fans pining not only for <em>Xenoblade Chronicles 4</em> on Switch 2 but also upgrades for the last two numbered entries. They’re also still waiting to see what’s up with <a href="https://wccftech.com/xenoblade-chronicles-x-definitive-edition-hidden-60-fps-mode/"><em>Xenoblade Chronicles X</em>‘s hidden 60fps mode</a>.</p>

 <p>There are also still lots of other old games Nintendo can pull onto the Switch 2 in one form or another. A Wii U HD remaster of <em>Twilight Princess</em> is still MIA on modern platforms, and the original <em>Luigi’s Mansion</em> could be remastered or added to the GameCube library on Switch Online. Nintendo’s also getting ready to release <em>Metroid Prime 4: Beyond</em> (a release date reveal at this Direct would be nice!) and yet two of the games in the original trilogy still aren’t available to play on Switch.</p> <h2><i>Smash Bros., Animal Crossing, </i>and <em>Mother 3</em></h2> <p>Beyond the next <em>Mario</em>, there are plenty of other Nintendo franchises that are ripe for their next entries. <em>Animal Crossing: New Horizons</em> is five years old now, and <em>Smash Bros. Ultimate</em> got its last DLC character in 2021. Despite multiple remakes in the series since, the last new<em> Luigi’s Mansion</em> was in 2019. It’s not quite time for a new <em>Fire Emblem</em> but we are getting close. And what about Nintendo’s back-bench franchises like <em>Star Fox</em>, <em>Punch-Out</em>, and <em>Pilotwings</em>? The company loves pulling from the past just as much as building new things.</p>

 <p>Speaking of new things, a new <a href="https://kotaku.com/switch-2-splatoon-3-raiders-upgrade-price-maps-1851784179"><em>Splatoon</em> spin-off called <em>Raiders</em></a> was teased earlier this year and will no doubt make an appearance at the Direct if it’s coming out any time in the next 12 months. It would also be nice to see more of FromSoftware’s upcoming Switch 2 exclusive <em>The Duskbloods</em>. There’s also no word on what Platinum Games is working on for the console. Could Switch 2 be getting <em>Bayonetta 4</em> or <em>Astral Blades 2</em> anytime soon? And I know Team Ninja has been very busy lately, but it would be neat to see <em>Marvel Ultimate Alliance 4</em> confirmed.</p> <p>The deepest cut of all would be <em>Mother 3</em>, the GBA game never officially localized in the West but which is already available through Switch Online in Japan. There was a big exhibit for the series <a href="https://essential-japan.com/news/classic-rpg-earthbound-gets-major-new-exhibition-in-tokyo-this-summer/">in Tokyo this summer</a>, and this year marks the 30th anniversary of <em>Earthbound</em> coming out in the U.S. Meanwhile, 2026 will mark the 20th anniversary for <em>Mother 3</em>. Series creator Shigesato Itoi is already 76 and not getting any younger. It’s time. Seriously. Just give us <em>Mother 3</em>. Hell, give us <em>Mother 4</em>! Or even a 3D remake of <em>Earthbound</em>. How much money do I need to spend these <a href="https://www.1101.com/mother_project/items/goldbox5.html"><em>Earthbound</em> figures</a> to make it happen?</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Now that the film and TV industries have finally cracked the code to making decent, sometimes great, live-action adaptations of video games, there’s actually good reason to pay attention to the developments of these works. To be excited about them, even. One of the latest games to get the treatment is none other than Xbox 360-era darling <i>BioShock</i>. The first one (not <i>Infinite</i>, thank god).</p> <p>As reported by <i>The Direct</i>, producer Roy Lee (<a href="https://kotaku.com/minecraft-movie-review-bad-jack-black-kids-movie-steve-1851775345"><i>A Minecraft Movie</i></a>, <i>Weapons</i>, <i>The Long Walk</i>) said that while everything else about the movie must be kept secret, “it’s definitely going to be based on the first <i>BioShock</i> game.” The deep sea adaptation hit a snag after some necessary script work, but it looks like it’s on track; now it just awaits director Francis Lawrence (<i>Constantine</i>, <i>The Hunger Games</i>, <i>The Long Walk</i>) who first has to wrap work on <i>The Hunger Games: Sunrise on the Reaping</i>.</p> <p>While I’ve been something of a hater of the non-stop barrage of live-action video game adaptations, I find the idea of bringing the first <i>BioShock</i> “to life” as a big-budget movie a neat proposition. Sure, the story is the most obvious expression of why <i>Atlas Shrugged</i>’s themes are stupid, but the setting, the underwater city of Rapture, was a real treat to explore, and seeing it reproduced on the big screen should be a treat.</p> <p>As a thematic device, Rapture is a pretty straightforward tool for skewering libertarian-minded politics, but as a setting, it’s dreamy and atmospheric, with tremendous potential for some seriously cool set and prop design. And if Francis Lawrence’s work on 2007’s <i>I Am Legend</i> is anything to go by, the man knows how to work well with evocative settings. Who knows, maybe we’ll take some better lessons away from this trip down to the doomed ocean floor city than we did the first time.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/crusader-kings-3-dev-apologizes-coronations-dlc-steam-paradox-2000624792</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Yesterday, <em><a href="https://kotaku.com/crusader-kings-iii-the-kotaku-review-1844848772">Crusader Kings 3</a></em> released a new DLC for the popular historical strategy game. The reaction to it was very negative, with complaints about it being small and broken, as well as including features that some players felt should have been in the main game. Now, the game’s QA manager has issued a lengthy apology and explained what happened.</p> <p>On September 9, Paradox Interactive released the “Coronations” DLC pack for <em>Crusader Kings 3</em>. This is just one of <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/dlc/1158310/Crusader_Kings_III/">many, many DLCs and expansions</a> that have been released for the large-scale strategy game since it launched back in 2020. However, shortly after Coronations launched on Steam, players began sharing negative reviews and complaining that one feature of the small DLC, oaths, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/CrusaderKings/comments/1nd6c2j/i_completed_my_oath_years_ago_wtf_paradox/">was completely broken and causing problems during campaigns</a>. Others complained that the small DLC should have been a free update and argued that Paradox has been squeezing player wallets more and more with these smaller DLCs. <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3315520/Crusader_Kings_III_Coronations/">The Coronations DLC now has an overall negative rating on Steam</a>.</p> <p>In response to all this negative feedback and anger, Paradox’s QA manager has posted an apology, explained what happened, and promised that the studio would do better in the future to prevent this from happening again.</p>

 <p><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1158310/view/517472660906573991">On Thursday, <em>Crusader Kings 3</em>‘s QA manager, Riad, shared a message</a> with fans on the game’s official Steam page. According to Riad, he’s been wanting to apologize to the community for the last 24 hours and asked the “higher-ups” for permission to write an apology.</p> <p>“I’m sorry. <wbr>Coronations was not up to the standard you deserve, and that’s on me,” said Riad. “As the QA Manager for the studio, it is my job to ensure that our releases meet the [quality assurance] vision we have set out. It is clear we didn’t give the project the resources and attention it needed, and the result was a release that let you down. You have every right to be upset, and I want to acknowledge that openly.”</p>

  <p>Riad explained that the studio has been “pouring enormous effort” into the next massive <em>Crusader Kings 3</em> expansion, All Under Heaven. According to the QA boss, it’s the biggest expansion the studio has ever made and “basically every resource” is “committed” to making sure the expansion is “up to [fan] expectations.” However, this led to other projects at Paradox, like the Coronations DLC, having fewer resources and staff. And while Riad is “very proud” of what the team was able to pull off with limited resources, the QA boss called the whole situation “unfair” to both fans and the devs. Riad also blamed “last-minute” changes for oaths being broken in the new DLC and claimed the studio was going to be more “stringent” about these tweaks.</p> <p>“Many of us on the team, myself included, joined Paradox as fans of the games. Meeting you at events…hearing your stories, and seeing how much <em>Crusader Kings 3 </em>means to you is what makes this work so meaningful,” said Riad. “That’s why it hurts so much when we fuck up like this. We don’t take your trust for granted, and I want to do my best to ensure we earn it back.”</p> <p>Riad says that there is at least one more patch on the way to fix more issues in the Coronations DLC and added, “Thank you for holding us accountable and for continuing to care about this game as much as we do. We will do better.”<wbr><wbr><wbr><wbr></p>

            <title><![CDATA[Soon-To-Be-Demolished Fry’s Electronics Is Your Daily Dose Of Liminal Dread]]></title>
            <link>https://kotaku.com/frys-electronics-store-abandoned-liminal-phoenix-az-2000624785</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/soon-to-be-demolished-fry%E2%80%99s-electronics-is-your-daily-dose-of-liminal-dread.1294182/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>The world of gaming and consumer electronics kinda feels like a liminal space right now if you grew up during the ‘00s, ‘90s, or earlier decades. The brick-and-mortar locations that many of us would visit to pick up a new game or simply to wander around and kill some time are increasingly empty, destined for destruction or for uses far removed from what they were before. And as physical media continues to be squeezed out of gaming thanks to the convenience of digital distribution and silly stuff like Nintendo’s Game Key-Cards, it doesn’t look like that’s likely to change anytime soon.</p> <p>If you’re looking to steep yourself in that strange feeling of seeing a world frozen in a state of abandonment, might I divert your attention to a set of photos from a vacant Fry’s Electronics store in Phoenix Arizona?</p>  <p>This emptied store came up on my radar while <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/LiminalSpace/comments/1nd42uk/frys_electronics_soon_to_be_demolished/">browsing Reddit’s r/LiminalSpace</a> (an experience that pairs well with <a href="https://somafm.com/darkzone/">SomaFM’s Dark Zone station</a>, I might add). Vast empty aisles and hanging signs advertising products that are nowhere to be found–it sure is a mood. And though the Aztec-themed stylings of this particular location use some different cultural affectations, its abandoned state reminds me of <a href="https://youtu.be/oysS9lBP644">the Las Vegas section of <i>Horizon: Forbidden West</i></a>, with notably less water and fewer robot dinosaurs (I hope).</p>

 <p>Unfortunately, this location is destined for demolition, so future Aloy will not be battling a Tideripper in here. Check out a walkthrough of <a href="https://youtu.be/Mx92kBmxzAY">this abandoned location here</a>:</p>   <p>Fry’s Electronics started closing all of its stores on February 24, 2021, a victim of the massive shift toward online shopping and the impact of the covid-19 pandemic. Being an East Coaster, I never had the chance to check out one of these stores. We have plenty of MicroCenters here, but <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/LiminalSpace/comments/1nd42uk/comment/ndejf78/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button">as one Redditor commented</a>, MicroCenter “lacks the personality” of what we can see even in the shots of this abandoned Fry’s.</p>

 <p>Elsewhere in the comments of the Reddit post highlighting the Phoenix Fry’s location, folks are shouting out the variety of themes Fry’s had across its various locations. A San Fernando Valley one was<a href="https://www.instagram.com/reel/C5SBIy4xBdA/?hl=en"> based on <i>Alice in Wonderland</i></a>. <a href="https://youtu.be/kC9clA3oRPg">Another in Austin, Texas had music themes</a>, with a piano-shaped entrance. San Jose’s had <a href="https://maps.app.goo.gl/CWUPs3TViVBdt5o28">a Mayan temple motif</a>.</p>  <p>It feels a bit strange to be basking mournfully in the liminal vibes of an abandoned big box store, since Fry’s was, after all, just another business like any other, a capitalist enterprise concerned only with amassing profit. Now the big chains are the food. Circle of capitalist life. I’m sure there’s an interesting academic article on that somewhere.</p>
