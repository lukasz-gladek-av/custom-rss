When it does let you play, it’s got a decent assortment of deductive puzzles, weird minigames, and stealth sequences where you have to outwit and evade some truly grotesque monsters.</p><p>It likes to spend long stretches of time without letting you do anything, but <em>Bridge Curse 2 </em>is a decent pick if you like some helplessness in your horror. It’s got a nasty edge to it, with some brutal death scenes, the occasional gratuitous gross-out, and a lot of terrible things happening to people who in no way deserved it. </p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="d04683daef9b853e9135ead14714ec02" data-recommend-id="image://d04683daef9b853e9135ead14714ec02" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="A purple-haired person runs toward a strange beastie in some pumpkin-laden woods." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A purple-haired person runs toward a strange beastie in some pumpkin-laden woods." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->SFB Games / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="d04683daef9b853e9135ead14714ec02" data-recommend-id="image://d04683daef9b853e9135ead14714ec02" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="A purple-haired person runs toward a strange beastie in some pumpkin-laden woods." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>Statistically, only about 30 percent of the players who start a video game will see it through to its end. As a result, many single-player games are front-loaded, on the assumption that a solid start is a better use of developers’ time than a strong finish.<span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://crowcountrygame.com/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://crowcountrygame.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"> <em>Crow Country</em></a></span><em> </em>defies that in its last half-hour, with a plot twist in its final moments that neatly turns the rest of the game on its head.</p><p>Before that point, it’s a quietly effective throwback to the ‘90s, both in its PlayStation-style graphics and the reflexive post-<em>Scream</em> irony of its script. As Mara Forest, an improbably young federal agent, you’re exploring an abandoned park in search of its reclusive owner when you’re attacked by strange mutants. From there, it’s a struggle to stay alive, save the handful of other people in the park, and still accomplish your stated goal.</p><p>Most of <em>Crow Country </em>is creepy without being scary, with a deliberate appeal towards nostalgia. (The designers went out of their way to create<span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://x.com/SFBDim/status/1777367629730025883&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://x.com/SFBDim/status/1777367629730025883" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"> mock literature for it</a></span> like a manual, magazine ad, and <em>GameFan</em>-style preview page.) It wasn’t until I reached the final area that it took that final swerve, which turned <em>Crow Country </em>into something dark, bleak, and quietly frightening. It’s worth the whole run just for that moment. </p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="a953fdc72025910c510f1ca217a1aee0" data-recommend-id="image://a953fdc72025910c510f1ca217a1aee0" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="A character crouches behind a table, as a spotlight-faced creature creeps about." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A character crouches behind a table, as a spotlight-faced creature creeps about." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Blumhouse Games / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="a953fdc72025910c510f1ca217a1aee0" data-recommend-id="image://a953fdc72025910c510f1ca217a1aee0" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="A character crouches behind a table, as a spotlight-faced creature creeps about." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://blumhouse.com/games/fear-the-spotlight&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://blumhouse.com/games/fear-the-spotlight" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>Fear the Spotlight</em></a></span><em> </em>is beginners’ horror, and I mean that as a compliment. It’s the video game equivalent to <em>Goosebumps </em>or <em>Scary Stories to Tell in the Dark</em>, which delivers its impact without relying on violence, gore or gross-outs.</p><p>You play as Vivian Singh, who breaks into her high school on the week of Halloween so her best friend Amy can conduct a séance. Soon, Vivian has been seemingly pulled back in time to the school as it was in 1991, right before a devastating fire that killed two-dozen students. She has to find her way through the school, past a strange man with a theater light for a face, and rescue Amy before history repeats itself.</p><p>If you’ve got any horror or adventure-game chops, you’ll breeze straight through <em>Fear the Spotlight</em>. It’s a fast-moving six-hour campfire story that really comes alive in its second half. The real value to picking it up is if you’ve got a teenager or precocious kid who’s interested in playing some creepy games for Halloween. It’s a solid dose of memorable PG-13 dread. </p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="5b3b3f998463036a1f6e4ab6546bd2a5" data-recommend-id="image://5b3b3f998463036a1f6e4ab6546bd2a5" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="721" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Our character fires a gun at a zombie in what might be a sewer tunnel." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Our character fires a gun at a zombie in what might be a sewer tunnel." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Headware Games / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="5b3b3f998463036a1f6e4ab6546bd2a5" data-recommend-id="image://5b3b3f998463036a1f6e4ab6546bd2a5" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="721" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Our character fires a gun at a zombie in what might be a sewer tunnel." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>A couple of different indie developers made “spiritual sequels” to Konami franchises this year, only to have Konami suddenly break its silence and steal their thunder.

What initially looks like a midnight run through a dead suburb turns bloody when Mica discovers the ruins are infested with bizarre plants and strange monsters.</p><p><em>Hollowbody</em> ends right when it feels like it’s hitting its stride, but it’s good while it lasts. For a game produced by one person with crowdfunding, it understands the value of atmosphere better than most indie survival horror projects. I’d be interested in seeing what Headware Games could do with an actual budget. As of October 29, it’s just released a new update that’s added several locations, tweaked its balance, and thrown in a few more puzzles. </p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="a393a361711150be920733a2d563c083" data-recommend-id="image://a393a361711150be920733a2d563c083" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Swansea talks to a character stuck in yellow foam." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Swansea talks to a character stuck in yellow foam." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Wrong Organ / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="a393a361711150be920733a2d563c083" data-recommend-id="image://a393a361711150be920733a2d563c083" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Swansea talks to a character stuck in yellow foam." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>It almost takes longer to explain<span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.headwaregames.com/hollowbody&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.headwaregames.com/hollowbody" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"> <em>Mouthwashing</em></a></span><em> </em>than it does to play. It’s a psychological thriller about space truckers who crash their ship, then go insane while waiting for a rescue that probably isn’t coming. The title of the game comes from their cargo, which turns out to be nothing more valuable than gallons upon gallons of 15 percent ABV mouthwash.</p><p>The word I keep coming back to is “bleak.” <em>Mouthwashing </em>starts off as a narrative-led adventure game, then occasionally turns into stealth/action as its characters degenerate. It’s also more willing to play with its basic presentation than any game has been since maybe <em>Eternal Darkness</em>, as it often abruptly transitions between scenes with effects that look like a hard crash.</p><p>It’s short, at around four hours, but if you take the trip, you’ll be thinking about this one for a while. It’s a vicious little bastard of an experience.</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="7c3e724825f7ea44bb60c1090a9dea56" data-recommend-id="image://7c3e724825f7ea44bb60c1090a9dea56" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="A purple Muppet-like runs down a corridor toward the player." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A purple Muppet-like runs down a corridor toward the player." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->John and Evan Szymanski / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="7c3e724825f7ea44bb60c1090a9dea56" data-recommend-id="image://7c3e724825f7ea44bb60c1090a9dea56" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="A purple Muppet-like runs down a corridor toward the player." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>This is what you’d have gotten if you’d hired David Lynch to direct <em>The Muppet Movie</em>.

When city repairman Gordon O’Brian shows up to find out why, he’s thrown into a cuddly nightmare. When this station closed down, the old performers got locked inside, and they’ve all gone insane. They don’t <em>mean </em>to hurt Gordon, but they will.</p><p>This is a hard one to explain or justify, but <em>My Friendly Neighborhood </em>makes the most of a twisted premise. Like <em>Fear the Spotlight</em>, it’s creepy without being gory, as every puppet has a gift of coming out of nowhere. And like <em>Crow Country</em>, it saves its scariest sequence for its endgame. If you missed this one last year, this Halloween’s a solid excuse to revisit it.</p><p>If you want something that’s about as unhinged, but much darker and weirder, the developers, the Szymanskis, spun off an older project into a standalone game earlier this year called <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://store.steampowered.com/app/2536530/The_Pony_Factory/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2536530/The_Pony_Factory/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>The Pony Factory</em></a></span>.

It’d be weirder if I didn’t.</p><p><em>Signalis </em>just celebrated its second anniversary, but if you’re new to survival horror with the <em>SH2 </em>remake or haven’t paid attention to the genre for a while, it’s worth bringing it up again. It also put out a patch last year with several optional improvements to its inventory system, which addressed one of fans’ most common complaints.</p><p>Self-described as “a dream about dreaming,” <em>Signalis </em>is a story of cosmic space horror. As an android worker in a dystopian society, you survived a shipwreck on the distant ice planet Leng, but your co-pilot is missing. Your search for her takes you into a nearby mining colony, where the humans have fallen prey to an inexplicable disease and the other androids have gone insane.</p><p>It’s also possible that this is all a dream, and not necessarily yours; that you’re lost in some Lovecraftian nightmare realm; and/or that you’re trapped in an endless cycle of violence by an insane god. All of these can be true at once. <em>Signalis </em>is a dream. Old rules no longer apply.</p><p>It’s by turns oppressive, frightening, and surreal, with a visual style that’s uniquely its own. If you haven’t played it, or you bounced off it at launch due to its inventory mechanics, now is a good time to check it out.</p><p>.</p></div></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Whether you’re a seasoned veteran of developer BioWare’s fantasy RPGs or a newcomer looking to see what all the fuss is about, it’s worth noting that <em>The Veilguard </em>represents a pretty drastic shift from the tactical, open-zone RPG gameplay of its predecessor, <em>Dragon Age: Inquisition</em>. So no matter what your previous experience, there are a few things worth noting before you dive into this long-awaited return to Thedas.

My most honest recommendation is to <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/dragon-age-veilguard-inquisition-origins-what-to-play-1851538846&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/dragon-age-veilguard-inquisition-origins-what-to-play-1851538846">play through all of the <em>Dragon Age</em> games and a few pieces of DLC</a></span>, but if you just don’t have the time and patience for all that, at least read or watch a summary of the events of <em>Dragon Age: Inquisition </em>and its <em>Trespasser </em>DLC. <em>The Veilguard </em>will give you a brief and kind of vague recounting of a few details when you boot it up, but it’s woefully insufficient in giving you a full sense of what led to the game’s opening moments.</p><h2 id="h36822"><a id=""></a><strong>Don’t pick your faction based on fashion</strong></h2><p><em>Dragon Age: The Veilguard</em> shows off several casual outfits and “aspirational” armors tied to your hero’s faction in the character creator. The faction you choose for Rook (the protagonist) gives the character a backstory that ties them to different places and cultures within the <em>Dragon Age</em> universe. But if you’re anything like me, you’re trying to serve at any given moment in an RPG, and I was conflicted about my faction choice because I wanted one of the sluttier outfits. However, this is your PSA that every casual outfit and aspirational armor you see in the character creator is available later in the game, so make the choice based on the story you want to tell, rather than the clothes you want to wear. You’ll find these outfits and armors in stores tied to their respective faction when you reach them in your playthrough.</p><h2 id="h36823"><a id=""></a><strong>Don’t accidentally skip the Inquisitor customization screen</strong></h2><p><em>The Veilguard </em>lets you create two characters at the beginning of the game. One is Rook, the hero you’ll be playing as, and the other is the Inquisitor, the protagonist from 2014’s <em>Dragon Age: Inquisition</em>. However, while the screen to customize the latter isn’t buried, it’s not as visually apparent as it probably should be. On the last two pages of Rook’s customization, you’ll see an option on the right-hand side to go to a different screen to create the Inquisitor and make three choices from the last game that will carry over. Unfortunately, it’s entirely possible to miss this screen, and the game doesn’t do much to direct your attention to it. You won’t have another chance to make the Inquisitor or these choices, and if you don’t, you’ll get hit with a default that might look and think nothing like your old hero.</p><h2 id="h36824"><a id=""></a><strong>You can only sell valuables at certain stores</strong></h2><p>Speaking of in-game shops, you’ll pick up a lot of valuables throughout your adventure that only exist to be sold to merchants you meet in Thedas. However, you might notice that not every shopkeeper is looking to buy your garbage. Each region has a specific merchant that is tied to the local faction, such as the Shadow Dragons in Minrathous or the Antivan Crows in Treviso. These will have a specific menu option to let you sell valuables, as well as upgrade their shops with other materials you find on your quests. Selling valuables to these shops will also increase the faction’s power, which is another way to improve relationships with groups beyond doing their quest lines.</p><figure id="" data-id="762f6348a9201b4b80094245e887c8c0" data-recommend-id="image://762f6348a9201b4b80094245e887c8c0" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Harding looks at something off-screen." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Harding looks at something off-screen." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->BioWare / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="762f6348a9201b4b80094245e887c8c0" data-recommend-id="image://762f6348a9201b4b80094245e887c8c0" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Harding looks at something off-screen." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><h2 id="h36825"><a id=""></a><strong>Keep an eye out for gifts for your teammates</strong></h2><p>Like in previous <em>Dragon Age</em> games, you can give gifts to your companions for an approval boost. (However, you unfortunately don’t get a new conversation out of it.) You can typically find these in the various shops around Thedas, with the gift often corresponding to the companion whose faction is based in that region.</p><h2 id="h36826"><a id=""></a><strong>Dodge-roll into potion pots</strong></h2><p>Throughout <em>The Veilguard</em>, you’ll see green pots that have a healing potion inside them. While the most obvious route to breaking these open would be to hit them with your sword/axe/dagger/orb, one strategy I used during frantic boss fights was to just dodge-roll into them. This will still break the pot and have you grab the potion as you pass through it, and won’t lock you into a static animation that leaves you vulnerable to an attack. “Do a barrel roll, Rook!” - Varric, probably</p><h2 id="h36827"><a id=""></a><strong>Look for conversations around the Lighthouse, not just in companion rooms</strong></h2><p>For most of <em>The Veilguard</em>’s companion conversations, you can rely on lit-up lanterns outside each character’s quarters to know when your party members want to talk to you. However, a lot of banter and side conversations are happening around the Lighthouse throughout the game, and you’ll have to seek these exchanges out. You can see if some characters aren’t in their rooms through the map, so check it every time you come to the Lighthouse because folks are rarely in the same place twice. You can stumble upon party members talking to each other, or they might have an observation to share with you, so be sure to make your rounds every time you head back to home base.</p><h2 id="h36828"><a id=""></a><strong>Never sacrifice power for fashion or vice versa</strong></h2><p>We touched on how your fashion doesn’t have to be determined by your faction, but it also doesn’t have to be determined by stats. <em>The Veilguard </em>has a pretty straightforward transmog system that lets you equip your most powerful armor and weapons while also placing a custom appearance on top of it. My mage Rook sports a slick Shadow Dragon leather armor set while also getting the stats of ill-fitting metal armor meant for the tankiest of warriors. Best of both worlds, baby. You can edit your appearance in Rook’s room in their wardrobe.</p><h2 id="h36829"><a id=""></a><strong>You can change your appearance throughout the game</strong></h2><p><em>Dragon Age: The Veilguard</em>’s character creator is extensive, and odds are you’ll spend a lot of time making your Rook look exactly how you want them to. But if you start playing the game and find you don’t like how something looks, you can tweak your appearance at any point by examining the mirror in the infirmary. So don’t get so caught up in the finer details that you feel like you can’t actually start playing the game until your Rook looks “perfect.”</p><h2 id="h36830"><a id=""></a><strong>You can respec at any time</strong></h2><p>If you’re not feeling the abilities or specialization you’ve picked a few hours in, <em>The Veilguard </em>lets you respec from the Skills menu at any time. This is a good way to encourage experimentation and let you feel out every build option in the game. I was pretty happy with the dagger-based Spellblade specialization, but if I wanted to, I could reset all my Rook’s points and try out a drastically different play style without any drawbacks. So try things out without worrying that you’re committing to any one build.</p><figure id="" data-id="a441954010decbde0605c0bbe8c2ef6b" data-recommend-id="image://a441954010decbde0605c0bbe8c2ef6b" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Davrin and Rook kiss as Assan walks toward them." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Davrin and Rook kiss as Assan walks toward them." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->BioWare / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="a441954010decbde0605c0bbe8c2ef6b" data-recommend-id="image://a441954010decbde0605c0bbe8c2ef6b" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Davrin and Rook kiss as Assan walks toward them." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><h2 id="h36831"><a id=""></a><strong>Romance has no restrictions</strong></h2><p><em>Dragon Age: Inquisition</em> is known for its diverse romances that are also restricted based on gender and race. However, <em>The Veilguard </em>has no such restrictions. The sequel thankfully manages to avoid the <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/video-game-romance-playersexual-baldurs-gate-dragon-age-1851253394&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/video-game-romance-playersexual-baldurs-gate-dragon-age-1851253394">“playersexual” trope</a></span> by establishing that each of its characters are pansexual rather than letting that just feel like something that’s defined by the player’s presence, but if you were concerned that you needed to play a certain gender or race to wife up your favorite companion, worry not.</p><h2 id="h36832"><a id=""></a><strong>Don’t neglect the memory quests</strong></h2><p>There’s a series of quests in <em>The Veilguard </em>that I can’t believe is optional, but it is. Spread across The Crossroads, a hub that connects all the other regions you can explore in the game, these quests involve flashbacks to antagonist Solas’ past, and each one contains a debrief with the team that has some major <em>Dragon Age </em>lore drops. You’ll have to seek them out, so be on the lookout for translucent, glowing barriers throughout The Crossroads, as walking through these will give you a glimpse into the elven god’s past.</p><h2 id="h36833"><a id=""></a><strong>Read the missives</strong></h2><p><em>Dragon Age: The Veilguard </em>has an equivalent to <em>Mass Effect</em>’s email system called Missives. You’ll get pop-up notifications that you received a new one when you return to the Lighthouse after most quests. These letters will come from companions and people you met around Thedas, and give you some notable insight into things going on outside your field of view in the <em>Dragon Age</em> world. Unfortunately, they’re buried in the pause menu next to the codex, rather than somewhere like the email terminals in <em>Mass Effect</em>, so it can be easy to forget about them if you don’t make a point to seek them out.</p><figure id="" data-id="4fcbf9850acd216c620fc204b9b130fb" data-recommend-id="image://4fcbf9850acd216c620fc204b9b130fb" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Rook slices through a foe with a magic knife." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Rook slices through a foe with a magic knife." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->BioWare / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="4fcbf9850acd216c620fc204b9b130fb" data-recommend-id="image://4fcbf9850acd216c620fc204b9b130fb" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Rook slices through a foe with a magic knife." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><h2 id="h36834"><a id=""></a><strong>Revives are attached to equipment</strong></h2><p>If you die in <em>The Veilguard</em>, you’ll notice there’s a “Revive” option next to the one that lets you reload a previous save. By default, you won’t be able to actually use the Revive function to stand right back up where you were in the fight, even as the game taunts you with the possibility on the game over screen. Revives are tied to rare pieces of equipment you’ll find for your companions. Having those revive charges will let your party members resuscitate you when you fall in battle, but that option will come at the expense of other utilities and upgrades. It’s a meaningful trade-off, but there was never a point where I wasn’t glad to have a revive on hand.</p><h2 id="h36835"><a id=""></a><strong>You can make your Rook trans, but you need to pick the option when you see it</strong></h2><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/dragon-age-veilguard-trans-choice-rook-gender-pronouns-1851682607&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/dragon-age-veilguard-trans-choice-rook-gender-pronouns-1851682607">We wrote about this already</a></span>, but if you missed it, <em>Dragon Age: The Veilguard </em>has an option to explicitly make your Rook trans early in the game. When you set up your hero’s quarters, you’ll place a handheld mirror down and have a moment for self-reflection. Here you’re able to pick dialogue options that confirm your Rook is trans, which unlocks new dialogue options to discuss this with other characters. However, as far as I can tell, this is the only chance the game gives you to make this decision. If that’s the route you want to go with your Rook, don’t miss it.</p><h2 id="h36836"><a id=""></a><strong>You can import your Rook when you start a new playthrough, but there’s no New Game+</strong></h2><p>For some reason, <em>Dragon Age</em> games never have New Game+ and <em>The Veilguard </em>is no exception. However, BioWare did do one thing right on this front, as it still allows you to import your Rook’s appearance into new playthroughs. So if you’re like me and get attached to the characters you make and want to run them again in your second playthrough, you can do that, unlike in previous <em>Dragon Age </em>games that made you recreate them every time. </p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

While the main goal is to dig at the barrow, the town’s web of residents and happenings sucks you in.

The art style looks like a mashup of <em>Darkest Dungeon</em> and <em>Warhammer</em> miniatures, and the gameplay revolves around rows of characters battling it out with turn-based abilities in search of XP and loot. Players grow their champions or craft new ones and can then sell them on a <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://championstactics.ubisoft.com/marketplace&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://championstactics.ubisoft.com/marketplace" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">crypto-backed marketplace</a></span>. </p><p>Here’s the gameplay trailer:</p><p>While the most expensive champion currently listed has an asking price of $63K, or about 1.9 million gold, many of the most recently listed ones are going for anywhere from $5 to around $200. The way cryptocurrency game economies tend to work is that players invest money to get stronger teams to win more matches to make their collectibles more valuable in the hopes of then turning around and selling them to newer recruits. It is 100 percent not a pyramid scheme, fans of these NFT-based games swear. </p><p>Ubisoft’s initial push into blockchain technology came in late 2021 when it tried to incorporate NFTs into <em>Ghost Recon Breakpoint</em>. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/ubisoft-nft-quartz-digits-ghost-recon-assassins-creed-p-1848437476&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/ubisoft-nft-quartz-digits-ghost-recon-assassins-creed-p-1848437476">The backlash from both fans and developers was swift</a></span>, however, and the buzz around everything crypto faded pretty quickly throughout 2022 and into 2023. The French publisher has been keeping at it, though, in case the gaming genre ever does blow up into something bigger. </p><p>Weirdly, <em>Champions Tactics: Grimoria Chronicles </em>lists an age rating of “adults only” in one of its trailers. A spokesperson for the ESRB told <em>IGN</em> that this was an error, and the game hasn’t officially been rated at all yet. It’s still unclear how successful the game will be, or if that will even matter for Ubisoft’s ongoing blockchain ambitions. The fact that <em>Champions Tactics</em> revolves around an NFT economy isn’t even the worst thing it has going for it. That would instead be the fact that you can currently only play it by downloading the company’s Ubisoft Connect launcher, which to some is even more disqualifying than needing to connect a crypto wallet. </p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
