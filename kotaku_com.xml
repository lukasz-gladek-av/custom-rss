              <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-legends-za-review-switch-2-bugs-performance-2000637719"><i><span>Pokémon Legends: Z-A’s</span></i></a> <i><span>Mega Dimension </span></i><span>DLC is just a few weeks away, and it’s bringing a handful of new <a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-mega-evolutions-best-worst-designs-legends-z-a-2000625459">Mega Evolutions</a>, a <a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-legends-za-mega-dimension-dlc-level-cap-100-2000641765">roguelike mode</a>, and additional story to the Nintendo Switch RPG. Today, Game Freak announced that Zeraora, one of the rare mythical Pokémon from Generation VI, is getting its own Mega Evolution in the DLC with a new trailer, and it sure does sound like the <a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-legends-za-mega-dimension-dlc-new-evolutions-2000641670">datamined list of new Megas is completely legit</a>.</span></p> <p><span>The trailer is brief, but shows the </span><i><span>Legends: Z-A </span></i><span>protagonist running around and fighting hostile Pokémon in a weird bizarro version of Lumiose City with Zeraora by their side. Just as the pair seems about to be overwhelmed, Zeraora mega evolves and manages to win the fight:</span></p>

  <p><em>Legends: Z-A</em>‘s Mega Evolutions have been so lopsided in terms of the goofy/cool ratio that it’s kind of refreshing to see Mega Zeraora is a super edgy, overdesigned electric cat boy. It’s straightforward and has that “middle schooler’s notebook doodle” design philosophy that is pretty prominent in a lot of the original Mega Evolution designs from <em>Pokémon X </em>and&nbsp;<em>Y</em>. I like the silly designs like Mega Victreebell and Slowbro, but we need some cool cats in the mix, too.</p>

 <p>Zeraora is one of several leaked Mega Evolutions dataminers found in <em>Legends: Z-A</em>‘s code, and thus far, every new form Game Freak has revealed for <em>Mega Dimension&nbsp;</em>has been on that list. We knew Raichu was getting two forms, then Baxcalibur and Chimecho were <a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-legends-za-mega-dimension-dlc-new-raichu-2000641644">revealed in the DLC’s first gameplay trailer</a>, so we’re just waiting for the rest of the list at this point.</p> <p>Some of the new Mega Evolutions will apparently include new forms for Pokémon who have already received Megas in the past, including Lucario, Absol, and Garchomp. At the moment, it’s unclear if those forms will have the same “X” or “Y” naming convention of other Pokémon who have gotten multiple Mega forms, including Raichu, Charizard, and Mewtwo, so fans have taken to calling them “Z” forms.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/if-you-own-an-iphone-amazon-gives-you-2-free-airtags-for-black-friday-2000645425</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/if-you-own-an-iphone-amazon-gives-you-2-free-airtags-for-black-friday.1357972/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Losing keys and wallets is a source of stress that tracking devices solve by locating the exact position through your phone. Individual (Apple) AirTags sell for $29 apiece which puts two units at around $60 before you add in Apple’s usual premium.</p>
<p>Amazon’s deal for Black Friday flips this math on its<a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3844/"> head by offering a four-pack for $64, down from the regular $99 price</a>. You’re basically<strong> paying for two AirTags at full price and getting two additional units as bonus freebies</strong>. This all-time low pricing makes stocking up on trackers for every item you frequently misplace finally affordable, and for iPhone users, it means access to Apple’s <em>Find My</em> network.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3844/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Precision Tracking via Apple’s Vast Network</h2>
<p>AirTags use the<strong> more-than-a-billion-strong Find My network of Apple devices worldwide</strong>, crowdsourcing locations even when items move beyond your Bluetooth range. Any passing iPhone, iPad, or Mac picks up your AirTag’s encrypted signal and relays its location anonymously back to your account without the intermediary device owner ever knowing. This network effect works great in cities where Apple devices are everywhere and provides near real-time updates as your lost item moves through populated spaces.</p>
<p>Precision Finding allows the iPhone 11 and newer to display directional arrows and distance measurements and leads you directly to where lost items are located. Ultra-wideband technology calculates the precise spatial positioning to show you which direction to walk and how many feet remain. The capability turns vague searches like “somewhere in this room” into guided treasure hunts leading you to the couch cushion holding your keys.</p>



<p>The built-in speaker plays sounds when you activate the Find My app which can help you find items buried under papers on your desk or tucked in jacket pockets you might have forgotten to check. The speaker volume gets loud enough to be heard from adjacent rooms, though thick materials like couch cushions muffle it significantly. You can also trigger the speaker when an AirTag separates from your iPhone beyond a certain distance and warns you that you’ve left something behind before you drive away or hop on a train.</p>
<p><strong>Battery life is around a year on the user-replaceable CR2032 coin cell battery</strong> which is a standard size available for a few bucks at grocery stores and gas stations. That replaceable design means you’re not tossing the entire tracker when power runs out, unlike sealed competitors that’ll become e-waste when their batteries eventually die.</p>



<p><strong>Water and dust resistance rated at IP67 lets AirTags survive splashes, rain, and brief submersion</strong> up to one meter for 30 minutes. The sealed construction protects internal components from pocket lint, dirt, and the general abuse that small accessories endure.</p>
<p>With four AirTags costing just $64, when singles are $29 apiece, you’re essentially getting $116 worth of trackers for barely more than the price of buying two units separately. The $35 discount and underlying buy-two-get-two-free math makes this four-pack the only sensible purchase option for iPhone users needing to track multiple items.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/dyson-quietly-unloads-its-185aw-vacuum-stick-on-amazon-now-cheaper-than-no-name-vacuums-2000645366</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/dyson-quietly-unloads-its-185aw-vacuum-stick-on-amazon-now-cheaper-than-no-name-vacuums.1357870/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Dyson built its reputation by staying away from Black Friday discounts and maintaining premium pricing year-round. That strategy ends this year as the brand drops record-low prices across its lineup on Amazon and signals a major shift in how they approach holiday sales: The <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4478/">V11 Origin now sells for $399, down from its regular $629 price tag (nearly 40% off)</a> and puts modern Dyson technology within reach of shoppers who previously settled for cheaper alternatives. You’ll also find the older V9 at $269, but that model dates back to 2016 with significantly weaker suction and outdated battery technology.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4478/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Power and Intelligence</h2>
<p>The <strong>V11 sends 185 air watts through its motor</strong> which provide 60% more suction than previous Dyson generations and beats most corded vacuums in debris pickup tests. This power amounts to the ability to clean both hard floors and carpets in single passes, eliminating the need for repeated cleaning of the same spots. The Motorbar cleaner head employs counter-rotating bristles that dig deep into carpet fibers while maintaining contact with hard surfaces, adapting automatically as you move room to room. <strong>Anti-tangle technology</strong> inside the brush bar keeps hair from wrapping around the roller.</p>
<p>Three modes of power give you control over suction intensity and battery life, depending on what you’re cleaning. Auto mode utilizes onboard sensors to detect floor type and dynamically adjust power for a balance of performance and runtime, extending battery life during everyday tasks. <strong>Eco mode dials back suction for light cleaning jobs and maximum runtime</strong>, stretching<strong> battery life up to 60 minutes</strong> for whole-home sessions. Boost mode unleashes full power for stubborn dirt in high-traffic areas or deep carpet cleaning, though it drains the battery faster at roughly five minutes of intensive use.</p>



<p>Real-time information is <strong>displayed on an LCD screen</strong> mounted on the body, something older cordless vacuums lack, showing remaining runtime counted down to the second. You will know just how much time remains for cleaning before you have to recharge, and you won’t have to deal with the annoying mid-room battery deaths. The screen will also alert you when maintenance is required, such as filter cleaning or blockage detection.</p>



<p>You can also <strong>convert it to handheld mode in a matter of seconds</strong> by detaching the wand and attaching tools directly into the motor body. This setup is ideal for car interiors, upholstered furniture and stairs where the full stick format becomes too unwieldy. The hair screw tool that comes with this vacuum has a conical brush bar designed especially for picking up pet hair on furniture, while the crevice tool reaches into tight gaps along baseboards and between cushions.</p>
<p><strong>HEPA filtration captures 99.97% of particles as small as 0.3 microns</strong>, and traps allergens and fine dust that lesser vacuums blow back into your air. The sealed system ensures that dirty air passes through the filter before exiting, making the V11 suitable for allergy sufferers who need cleaner air as much as cleaner floors. The bagless design includes a bin that you empty with a single button press, with no ongoing costs for replacement bags.</p>
<p>At $399 for a vacuum packing 185AW, you’re getting Dyson’s current engineering for less than many inferior stick vacuums cost at full price. $230 off means this is the first time the V11 has dipped below $400 and undercuts even generic mid-range models that lack the power, battery life and smart features.</p>
