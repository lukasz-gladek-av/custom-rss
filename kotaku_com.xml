              <p>Good morning. Unfortunately, I swear it’s not my fault but yes, today is Tuesday, aka <a href="https://kotaku.com/days-of-the-week-ranked-from-best-to-worst-2000639864">the worst day of the week</a>. But hey, at least we are here together to enjoy another installment of <em>Kotaku’s</em> Morning Checkpoint, a daily round-up of video game news and other stuff you might care about. Today, we have data on how well <em>Elden Ring</em>‘s DLC is selling, a weird <em>Stranger Things</em> crossover, and a report of a new 2K studio with connections to that canceled<em> Perfect Dark</em> game.</p> <h2><strong>Bosses Behind Canned<em> Perfect Dark</em> Reboot Reportedly Creating New 2K Studio</strong></h2> <p>First announced in 2020 and then officially revealed in <a href="https://kotaku.com/perfect-dark-xbox-showcase-gameplay-1851528864">2024 with a snazzy gameplay trailer</a>, Xbox’s <em>Perfect Dark</em> reboot had a lot of buzz around it before <a href="https://kotaku.com/xbox-reportedly-cancels-that-cool-looking-perfect-dark-1851785531">it was canned by Microsoft in July</a>. The studio behind the game, The Initiative, was also shut down. And now, <a href="https://kotaku.com/perfect-dark-canceled-take-two-embracer-xbox-crystal-dynamics-2000622400">following a reported attempt at Take-Two to save</a> <em>Perfect Dark,</em> the publisher behind <em>GTA</em> and<em> NBA 2K</em> has apparently hired two of the bosses behind the canceled reboot and is funding the creation of a new game studio.</p>

 <p><a href="https://bsky.app/profile/did:plc:2mkgbhbhqvappkkorf2bzyrp/post/3m7izaecnvc2j">As first reported by <em>Bloomberg’s</em> Jason Schreier</a> on Tuesday, former <em>Perfect Dark</em> director Brian Horton and former The Initiative studio head Darrell Gallagher are building a brand new studio within 2K Games. <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7403902973464014848/">Gallagher later confirmed the news on LinkedIn</a>. We have no other details about the studio, but it is interesting to see this saga unfold. I guess some people at Take-Two were really impressed by that<em> Perfect Dark</em> demo, huh?</p> <div><blockquote data-bluesky-uri="at://did:plc:2mkgbhbhqvappkkorf2bzyrp/app.bsky.feed.post/3m7izaecnvc2j" data-bluesky-cid="bafyreiedakzbq5fnpipnr65rwghg5p7c3gpqxejosc73vaimwdnixdbuwi"> <p lang="en">Earlier this year I broke the news that Take-Two was close to rescuing Xbox’s Perfect Dark but the deal fell apart.</p> <p>Now, a new development: Take-Two has hired Perfect Dark studio head Darrell Gallagher and director Brian Horton to start a brand new studio within 2K.</p> <p>— <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/did:plc:2mkgbhbhqvappkkorf2bzyrp?ref_src=embed">Jason Schreier (@jasonschreier.bsky.social)</a> <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/did:plc:2mkgbhbhqvappkkorf2bzyrp/post/3m7izaecnvc2j?ref_src=embed">2025-12-08T21:51:37.009Z</a></p></blockquote></div>  <h2><strong>Why <em>Resident Evil 2</em> Featured No Returning Characters</strong></h2> <p><em>Resident Evil 2</em> game director, <em>Bayonetta</em> creator, and famed online poster Hideki Kamiya has recently been talking more about Capcom’s beloved 1998 survival horror game on social media. And on December 9, <a href="https://x.com/HidekiKamiya_X/status/1998278386020671793?">Kamiya explained to a fan</a> why he didn’t include any characters from <em>Resident Evil</em> in the sequel, saying:</p>

 <p>“At the time, I was a selfish idiot who didn’t consider the feelings of the users, so when I was making <em>Biohazard 2</em>, I decided to remove all the characters from the previous game and start a new one. In the end, this was buried in the dark as <em>Biohazard 1.5</em>, and when Sugimura-sensei joined the team later, he got mad at me, saying, ‘Why aren’t you including the characters from the previous game?’, so I added Chris’s sister, Claire…”</p>

 <h2><strong><em>Elden Ring: Nightreign’</em>s First DLC Has Already Sold Over 2 Million Copies</strong></h2> <p>In less than two weeks, <em>Elden Ring: Nightreign’s&nbsp;</em>first DLC, Forsaken Hollows, has already sold two million copies. <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2622380/view/493836377652201354?l=english">The news comes via FromSoftware</a>, who posted a thank you to all the fans who have “joined the hunt against the Dreglord.”</p> <h2><strong>And now for one of 2025’s weirdest crossovers</strong></h2> <p>When I think of <em>Microsoft Flight Simulator, I</em> think of realistic planes, gorgeous landscapes, and of course, a hit TV show set in the 80s featuring demons and sci-fi monsters. Wait, sorry, I wrote that sentence after falling down the stairs and landing on my head really hard. Anyway, yeah, <a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2025/12/09/netflix-stranger-things-coming-to-microsoft-flight-simulator-2024/"><em>Stranger Things</em> is coming to <em>Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024.</em> Yay?</a></p> <h2>ICYMI:</h2> <ul> <li><a href="https://kotaku.com/horses-review-steam-epic-games-ban-horror-ride-race-2000651442">Here’s our review of the controversial <em>Horses</em></a></li> <li><a href="https://kotaku.com/gamestop-trade-in-anything-day-pokemon-coupon-2000651415">The chaos of Gamestop’s “Trade In Anything” day</a></li> <li><a href="https://kotaku.com/the-streamer-awards-2025-streamer-of-the-year-2000651399">The Streamer Awards were a mess</a></li> <li><a href="https://kotaku.com/metroid-prime-4-beyond-kotaku-review-is-it-good-120-fps-switch-2-2000651400">And here’s our review of <em>Metroid Prime 4</em></a></li> </ul> <h2>Watch This:</h2>
