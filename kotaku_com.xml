            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/nintendo-pokemon-pokopia-game-key-card-2000642940">Game key cards</a> were one of the more deflating aspects of the Switch 2’s launch year. While digital downloads are now ubiquitous, some of Nintendo’s most devoted (and loudest) fans still prefer physical games for the purposes of collecting or preservation, or just because they look nice. A cartridge that doesn’t actually have the game on it just isn’t the same. Yet despite all the uproar over the issue, a new survey suggests people are buying game key cards anyway.</p> <p>Deku Deals, an aggregator of sales and discounts for physical games, shared some new data about its users that shows game key cards are selling just fine. “Of the 1,070 Deku Deals users who have added one or more third party physical releases to their collection, 735 of them own one or more Game-Key Card titles,” the site wrote in <a href="https://www.dekudeals.com/articles/are-switch-2-owners-buying-third-party-game-key-card-releases">a new blog post this week</a>. There’s even a pie chart to show the disparity.</p>

 <p>The site also listed the most popular Switch 2 games among its users. Six of them are game key cards (the bolded ones):</p> <ul> <li><em>Cyberpunk 2077: Ultimate Edition</em></li> <li><em><strong>Bravely Default Flying Fairy HD Remaster</strong></em></li> <li><em>Hades II</em></li> <li><em>Rune Factory: Guardians of Azuma</em></li> <li><em><strong>Star Wars Outlaws Gold Edition</strong></em></li> <li><em><strong>Yakuza 0 Director’s Cut</strong></em></li> <li><em><strong>Final Fantasy VII Remake Intergrade</strong></em></li> <li><em><strong>Street Fighter 6 Years 1-2 Fighters Edition</strong></em></li> <li><em><strong>Persona 3 Reload</strong></em></li> <li><em>Story of Seasons: Grand Bazaar</em></li> </ul> <p>Of course, it’s worth noting that the&nbsp;<em>majority</em> of Switch 2 physical games are actually game key cards. So if you’re someone who just buys a bunch of games in general, or are one of those hyper-fans who wants to own all of the Switch 2’s launch library, you’re going to end up with a bunch of game key cards by default. At the same time, the survey at least suggests that people who would buy physical in the first place are still opting for game key cards&nbsp;over just buying the game digitally from the eShop. That’s probably the sentiment that led Nintendo to launch game key cards in the first place.</p>

 <p>At launch, companies reportedly only had access to the 64GB card sizes for physical Switch 2 games. The extra expense is what steered so many to opting for game key cards instead. <em>Hades 2</em>, for example, is $50 for the Switch 2 cartridge but only $30 if you buy it in the eShop. Other companies have just eaten the loss on margins. That’s seemingly what CD Projekt Red did with<em> Cyberpunk 2077: Ultimate Edition</em>.</p>

 <p>Fortunately, it sounds like that is no longer a restriction for companies moving forward. <em>R-Type Dimensions 3</em> publisher Inin Games accidentally leaked that more cartridge sizes had become available back in December before <a href="https://kotaku.com/switch-2-dev-explains-why-its-ditching-game-key-cards-thanks-to-nintendo-2000654878">deleting its post on the subject</a>. Game key cards will still be necessary for some games. The file size for <em>Final Fantasy VII Remake Intergrade</em> on Switch 2 is too big to fit on a cart, and developers for open-world games like <em>Star Wars Outlaws</em> have argued that loading data off of a physical cartridge is too slow to yield decent performance. We’ll see if players stop opting for game key cards if and when they become less prevalent.</p>

              <p>Because Nintendo couldn’t do anything as normal as just release a trailer with a press release, today greeted us with a&nbsp;<em>Tomodachi Life: Living the Dream</em> Direct, in which the Japanese giant revealed lots more details about its upcoming threequel to 2009’s DS Mii-based social sim game <em>Tomodachi Collection</em> and its 2014 3DS sequel, <em>Tomodachi Life</em>. We’ve picked out the most interesting news, and you can watch the whole Direct below.</p> <p>The&nbsp;<em>Tomodachi</em> games are all about the social lives of Miis, the user-created characters best known from the Nintendo Wii, that still sort of persist today. Think&nbsp;<em>The Sims</em>, but with much bigger heads and far more complicated interpersonal issues.</p>

 <figure id="attachment_2000664132" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000664132"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000664132">© Nintendo / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <h2>An all new Mii creator</h2> <p><em>Living the Dream</em> isn’t reinventing the wheel, once again having you design your own residents for an island by designing Miis. You can either have the game generate their look by asking you a series of questions, or make use of a far more in-depth character creator than we’ve seen for Miis in the past. There are ear-shape choices for the cartoon creations.</p> <h2>You can choose ‘dating preferences’ and be non-binary</h2> <p><em>Tomodachi</em> fans have long been hoping that this third entry in the series will finally introduce same-sex relationships, and a promise that during character creation you can choose “dating preferences” confirms that. You can also choose to be non-binary as well as male or female.</p>

 <figure id="attachment_2000664136" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000664136"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000664136">© Nintendo / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <h2>You can medal in everyone’s relationships</h2> <p>At one point during the Direct we see the player character deep in thought in her house. She’s musing about matchmaking a local doctor with a resident jester, and you can suggest a talking point to help the pair hit it off. In this example, the unlikely subject of “monster trucks” is typed in, and despite this they do manage to find something in common.</p>

 <h2>There’s a bonkers news network for the island</h2> <figure id="attachment_2000664129" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000664129"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000664129">© Nintendo / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p>MiiNews Network provides updates for what’s going on in and around the island on which all your Miis live, although it appears to be providing some deeply surreal offerings. Clips shown in the Direct include a trip through time for a research crew searching for the origins of life, and news of a “nearby faucet that appeared to be dispensing Patrick,” as a man emerges from an outdoor tap. Which makes it slightly more grounded and realistic than Fox News.</p> <h2>You can make your house look like a supermarket</h2> <p>Home decor is of course available for making your Miis’ homes unique. The options on offer seem pretty vast, with the Direct showing off that you can make a house look like a supermarket with shelves packed with produce, or a library complete with hundreds of books.</p>

 <h2>Patrick seems like a douche</h2> <figure id="attachment_2000664127" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000664127"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000664127">© Nintendo / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p>Patrick appears as the generic love interest during the trailer. But look at him. What a douche. Thankfully, after he turns down our main character, she instead starts to notice just what a lovely chap that jester Hugh Morris seems to be. She’s in love! But she matched Hugh Morris with Dr. Winters! LOVE TRIANGLE! And they force him to choose! Well, gross, and it serves our character right that she completely loses out.</p> <h2>Oh lord, you can design your own ‘animals,’ buildings and clothing</h2> <p>Who’s ready for an island made of dicks? That’s what Nintendo’s apparently inviting with the ability to draw your own creations and have them appear in the game. This can take the form of a pet (a pet dick), designs on clothing (a dick shirt), or the ground and outsides of buildings (dicks dicks dicks).</p> <h2><em>Tomodachi Life: Living the Dream</em> is out April 16</h2> <p>Well, there’s not a lot to add there, other than to note that it’s coming to both the original Switch and the Switch 2.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[This Chill Climbing Game Is So Frustrating It Sent Me Into A Mini-Crisis]]></title>
            <link>https://kotaku.com/cairn-review-game-bakers-haven-impressions-furi-2000664121</link>
            <guid>1419637</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><span>How many chances should you give a game before you decide it’s just not clicking with you? That’s what I asked myself every time I booted up the Game Bakers’ </span><i><span>Cairn</span></i><span>. As a huge fan of the studio’s past work with its romance RPG </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/haven-is-a-sci-fi-rpg-about-being-in-a-long-term-relati-1838020224"><i><span>Haven</span></i></a><span>, I was eager to put on some climbing gear and see what the team had waiting for me at the top of its rocky mountain. But each time I turned the game back on, I felt like I was struggling to get a foothold in its dense, cumbersome climbing.</span></p> <p><span>A lot of games make you climb, but few have ever required me to be as intentional with every single movement as I scaled their cliffs. In most games that have you climbing and doing cool parkour tricks, simply pushing your analog stick in the right direction will have your hero pretty autonomously accounting for every gap between handholds, with the developer having painstakingly crafted a path for you to cross that miraculously accounts for where the character’s feet are going to go as you reach for your next conveniently placed grip. </span><i><span>Cairn</span></i><span>, meanwhile, makes you move all four of heroine Aava’s extremities independently, which is what makes the game challenging, and often maddening.</span></p>

 <p><span>I spent my time with </span><i><span>Cairn</span></i><span> methodically charting a course up the side of a cliff, hoping that by the time I reached the halfway point I’d have somewhere for both feet and both hands to rest, lest I find myself tumbling down a chasm after my limbs grew weak from all the exertion. Much like in real rock climbing, your climbing in </span><i><span>Cairn</span></i><span> rapidly oscillates between stretches of breezy momentum as you effortlessly climb and find places where your hands and feet can comfortably sit, and very sudden roadblocks. Encountering these, you&nbsp; only have so much time to figure out how to proceed before Aava’s shaky legs give out from under you.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><i><span>Cairn</span></i><span>’s control scheme can be awkward to navigate, with you having to swap between the various limbs you’re controlling at any given moment, and your view of them often obscured by Aava’s torso in the game’s behind-her-back camera angle. Even when it highlights her limbs as you pivot between them, their positioning can get so wacky as you’re climbing that it can be difficult to tell whether you’re controlling her right arm or her left leg. Aava’s body contorts to ascend the side of these mountains, and when precise movement is so core to your progress in this game, even the slightest moment of obscurity can turn a mostly frictionless scale into a quick fall back to the start of a climb.</span></p>

  <p><span>Movement is clunky in </span><i><span>Cairn</span></i><span>, and movement is what you do in this game. Even when Aava is standing on solid ground, the weight of her climbing gear makes her sluggish to pilot, so simply stepping along a flat surface requires the same kind of measured attention as deciding which chip in the stone to reach for next. You’re not really meant to run up to the side of a cliff and just start crawling up the side of it. Every path you endeavour to climb must be meticulously planned, often from below, and I can imagine how that kind of slow, thoughtful movement could click for someone more patient than I, but </span><i><span>Cairn</span></i><span>’s dedication to emulating the full-body workout of rock climbing can’t get out of its own way.</span></p>

 <p><span>I sometimes think about how video game control schemes can never truly capture realistic movement on an intuitive, sensory level. As much as we become accustomed to the clicking of buttons, the clanking of sticks, and the swerving of a gaming mouse, they are still approximations of real-world movement, an imperfect translation of how our bodies navigate physical space and experience sensory input. VR allows for the closest approximation, and even it can’t replicate the feeling of a gun’s kickback or punching a bad guy in the jaw. </span><i><span>Cairn</span></i><span> is going the extra mile to try and recreate the feeling of having to independently account for your entire body at any given moment, in a way that we often take for granted when we’re just walking through life. Climbing requires you to be aware of everything from your toes to fingertips. The game’s attempt to replicate that is an admirable one, but the gap it tries to bridge between how the human body moves and how a video game character does feels like it doesn’t quite meet in the middle. What’s left is something that rewards a level of patience I don’t think I have anymore. I’ll just keep my feet firmly planted on the ground for now.</span></p>

You simply place your handheld device into the foldable stand, connect the docking station with a single cable, and immediately gain access to a display, a wired internet connection, and additional accessories. The stand’s design keeps the handheld device’s rear vents exposed, allowing proper airflow and cooling during both use and charging.

<h2>A handy dock to keep your Steam Deck and accessories on</h2>
<p><span>The UGREEN Steam Deck Dock’s adjustable, foldable stand uses two hinges to give you a comfortable viewing angle for your handheld gaming system.

            <title><![CDATA[TCL 40″ Smart TV Crashes to All-Time Low and Doubles as a PC Monitor for Less (Alexa Built-in, Apple AirPlay Compatibility)]]></title>
            <link>https://kotaku.com/tcl-40-smart-tv-crashes-to-all-time-low-and-doubles-as-a-pc-monitor-for-less-alexa-built-in-apple-airplay-compatibility-2000663944</link>
            <guid>1419526</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Is your living room in need of a new TV, or do you want a screen for your bedroom to enjoy your favorite shows while snuggling in the blanket? Prefer a smaller screen and not looking to shell out big bucks on the upgrade? The TCL 40-inch Class S3 TV checks all those boxes.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6938/">Currently, this modest-sized TV is going for just $150 at Amazon, after the retailer took 21% off its usual $190 price tag</a>. It’s the lowest we have seen this screen go in a long while, and placing your orders today can also help you skip delivery charges altogether. But as you’d expect, the deal is selling out fast. If you’ve been looking to add a new screen to your entertainment setup, now is the time to act.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6938/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Impressive Visuals</h2>
<p>The 40-inch size is pretty decent. It’s not massive, but also not too small to make the content feel cramped. This size is ideal for bedrooms and smaller living areas where you don’t want the screen to take over the entire wall. With this one, you’re getting an elegant edge-to-edge glass design for that modern look that blends effortlessly into any space.</p>
<p>The 1080p full HD resolution delivers a bright, sharp, and detailed picture quality, which can bring any content to life. There’s also a direct LED backlight for better brightness uniformity and picture performance compared to edge-lit TVs, which adds to the immersive experience. Whether you’re catching up on the latest crime thriller on Netflix or streaming a nature documentary, you’ll experience breathtaking detail with exceptional color accuracy. Yellow won’t turn into neon, and shadows stay visible instead of turning black. The latter is especially helpful when you’re playing a game on the TV, as it helps you spot enemies hiding in the dark easily.</p>



<p>You’ll also never be out of content to watch, thanks to the built-in Fire TV. This TCL screen comes with all the popular streaming platforms – like Netflix, Prime Video, Disney+, Peacock, and more – preinstalled. There’s support for Spotify too, which makes it easy to vibe to your favorite songs in the background as you finish house chores. Most of these platforms, however, require a monthly subscription. Looking to cut back on those? No sweat. Free options such as Freevee, Pluto TV, Tubi, plus live channels, are available too. Maybe start the day by catching up on what’s happening around the world with live TV, and then wind down at night with an episode of your all-time favorite show. All is possible, and that too, without cable.</p>
<p>Navigation is made easy with the Alexa voice remote. It lets you search and launch content both manually and using your voice. For instance, when you’re not in the mood to press some buttons, you can say something like “Alexa, launch Netflix”, or “Alexa, show me the latest horror movies on Prime Video”, and your command will be answered in seconds. Additionally, AirPlay compatibility lets you share videos, photos, and music, and more to the TV from your compatible iPhone or iPad.</p>
<p>There are more features to appreciate here, but to wrap it up, if you’re looking to grab a new smart TV without breaking the bank, this 40-inch TCL TV deal makes the jump easy. Just be sure to act before it’s too late.</p>
