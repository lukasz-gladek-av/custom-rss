            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Handheld gaming PCs have had a <em data-start="168" data-end="176">moment</em> these past few years. The Steam Deck basically kicked the door open, and then devices like the Lenovo Legion Go and the Asus ROG Ally walked right in behind it. They’re convenient, sure, and there’s something very fun about flopping on the couch and playing full PC games without the weight of a whole laptop. But at the end of the day, those handhelds are still pretty focused on gaming and not a whole lot else. If you want something that can actually do all the normal “computer stuff” <em data-start="666" data-end="671">and</em> play the games you want, a good gaming laptop still just makes more sense. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5631/">And right now, Amazon has a solid deal running on the Asus TUF F16. It normally sits at around $1,300, but it’s marked down to $950 at the moment—a nice $350 off.</a></p>
<p>Let’s talk specs for a minute, because that’s what really makes or breaks a gaming laptop. The TUF F16 comes with a 16-inch display in a 16:10 aspect ratio, and it pushes a Full HD resolution. The refresh rate tops out at 165Hz, which is great if you play anything fast-paced or competitive, and the response time clocks in at 7ms. It also uses Adaptive-Sync, which basically helps keep your games looking smooth by cutting down on screen tearing and random stutters. The bezels are pretty slim too, so you get a surprising amount of screen without the whole machine feeling huge.</p>

<h2>Subtle Styling</h2>
<p data-start="1493" data-end="1738">The keyboard is full-size with a number pad—which you don’t always get on laptops these days. Asus also gave the WASD keys a gold highlight, which is a small touch but a fun one if you like a little flair without going full RGB explosion.</p>
<p data-start="1493" data-end="1738">Under the hood, this particular model is running an Intel Core i5-13450HX paired with an NVIDIA GeForce 5050 laptop GPU. You get 16GB of RAM and a 512GB PCIe Gen4 SSD for storage. It’s not a monster machine that will play every AAA title at ultra settings, but for the price, it’s more than capable. Indie games will be a breeze to run, and a lot of bigger-budget titles should run just fine at medium settings without you needing to sacrifice too much.</p>


<p data-start="2777" data-end="2997">Battery life is solid, too. The 90Wh battery supports fast charging, letting you go from dead to 50% in about half an hour. You also get a 100W USB-C port that can charge your phone or accessories, which is always handy.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>This LEGO Christmas tree has become Amazon’s best-selling toy over the past week, and it received back-to-back price cuts in seven days. The <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5554/">set just dropped to $26 from its usual $44 price and marks a 40% discount and a new record low</a> for this holiday season icon. <strong>Amazon sold over 60,000 units already</strong>&nbsp;which shows how people are jumping on this early Black Friday deal before inventory disappears. The 2-in-1 building option <strong>lets you construct either one large tree or two smaller trees</strong>, which gives you flexibility for different display spaces.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5554/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Holiday Classic</h2>
<p>The larger tree configuration <strong>stands over 11 inches tall</strong> which makes it substantial enough to serve as a tabletop centerpiece without dominating your space. Each tree comes adorned with miniature ornaments, candles, and a yellow star on top that captures the classic Christmas tree aesthetic. The LEGO designers nailed the proportions and details that make this recognizable as a Christmas tree rather than just a generic green structure.</p>
<p>The 2-in-1 building option is what separates this from single-configuration sets that limit your creativity. You can build one tall tree at 11 inches for a dramatic display, or <strong>construct two smaller trees at 9 inches and 6 inches</strong> to spread holiday cheer across multiple rooms. Families can split the pieces and build together, creating matching trees for different spaces in the house.</p>



<p>Build quality matches what you’d expect from LEGO with tight brick connections and durable pieces that survive multiple rebuilds. The green pieces interlock firmly enough to create a solid structure that won’t fall apart when you move it around your house. The <strong>ornament details use clever brick combinations</strong> that add visual interest without requiring hundreds of tiny frustrating pieces. The<strong> color palette stays traditional with greens, reds, and touches of gold</strong> that fit any holiday decor style.</p>



<p>The timing makes this <strong>perfect for early holiday decorating or as a family activity during Thanksgiving weekend</strong>. You can build it together as a group project that gets everyone involved in holiday preparations without spending hours untangling light strings or arguing about ornament placement. The set arrives ready to build with all pieces included and no batteries or electronics required.</p>
<p>At $26 for a set that normally costs $44, you’re getting legitimate holiday decor. You’re investing in reusable decor that brings joy every year instead of disposable decorations that end up in landfills, all while paying pocket change during this record-low Black Friday pricing.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Nintendo Joy-Con Controllers (L/R) Are Going for Peanuts as a Special Early Black Friday Deal]]></title>
            <link>https://kotaku.com/game-better-with-the-nintendo-joy-con-l-r-2000644661</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/nintendo-joy-con-controllers-l-r-are-going-for-peanuts-as-a-special-early-black-friday-deal.1355542/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>One of the main ways to play on the Nintendo Switch is with the Joy-Con controllers. If you’ve been looking to upgrade your existing ones or just want to gift a fresh set to a gamer in your life this holiday season, we’ve got good news.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5630/">Right now, the Nintendo Joy-Con (L/R) are down to $79 on Amazon, which is 12% off their usual $90 price tag.</a> Joy-Cons rarely see major discounts, which makes this one a great option to grab a new pair without paying the full price. There are other color options available, too, though the discount may vary depending on the one you choose. The Neon Red and Blue combo is a classic, though, and it makes the most sense to grab it while it’s the most heavily discounted. We just highly recommend acting fast to snag it up, as the deal is likely going to wrap up soon.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5630/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Multiple Ways to Play</h2>
<p>These Bluetooth controllers can be used in multiple ways. You can use them independently in each hand, attach them to a Joy-Con grip for a single controller-style unit, or snap them onto the Switch for handheld gaming. Each of these has a full set of buttons, so using one as a standalone mini-controller won’t feel limiting at all. In fact, it’s going to come in handy for some two-player sessions in games!</p>
<p>There’s an accelerometer paired with a gyro-sensor for accurate, two-dimensional movement tracking. These make it possible to pull off motion-based gameplay without requiring any additional accessories.</p>



<p>Battery-wise, you’re looking at up to 20 hours of continuous use on a full charge, which is more than enough to support at least a couple days of gaming. They recharge quickly too and are back to full in about 3.5 hours, so you can get back to the action without much downtime. Recharging can be done by attaching them to the Nintendo Switch console while it’s docked or plugged in. You can also insert them in the Joy-Con Charging Grip which is sold separately, or go for third-party charging accessories.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5630/">Again, it’s best to grab the offer sooner rather than later. We’re not expecting Amazon to keep this deal live for too long, especially with holiday shopping ramping up.</a> Once the discount disappears, you’ll have to pay the full $90 price or worse, deal with shipping delays.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/ahead-of-black-friday-amazon-has-its-fire-tv-stick-hd-on-sale-for-half-price-2000644443</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/amazon-is-practically-giving-away-the-new-fire-tv-stick-hd-in-a-pre%E2%80%93black-friday-price-meltdown.1355515/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Back when the Amazon Fire TV Stick first showed up, the whole pitch was basically, “Hey, plug this in and boom—your old TV is suddenly smart.” Fast-forward to now, and most TVs fresh off the shelf already have some kind of smart interface built in. The thing is, a lot of those built-in interfaces… kind of suck. Some companies still haven’t cracked the code on making a simple, smooth UI. (Looking at you, LG, with your strange Wiimote-wannabe remotes). So at this point, the real draw of the Fire TV Stick isn’t that it makes your TV “smart”—it’s that it gives you a <em data-start="722" data-end="730">better</em> smart experience. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4359/">And right now, the newest Fire TV Stick HD is down to just $18.</a> Normally it runs $35, but this deal chops nearly half off the price, which is pretty hard to complain about.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4359/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<p>Once you plug it in, you can basically stream anything you’d expect: Netflix, Hulu, HBO Max (or whatever they’re deciding to call it this month), Disney+, Prime Video—the usual cast.. As long as you’ve got the subscriptions, the content is there. But even if you don’t want to spend any more on streaming subs, the Fire TV Stick actually has quite a bit of free stuff built in. Apps like Freevee, Tubi, Pluto TV, and a ton of Fire TV’s own free channels give you a surprising amount of movies and TV show episodes to just kick back and watch. Sure, they’re ad-supported, but free is free.</p>
<p data-start="1513" data-end="1986">One of the nicest quality-of-life things is the Alexa remote. No one enjoys hunting and pecking their way through an on-screen keyboard with a clunky d-pad. With the Alexa button, you literally just say what you want—“play <em data-start="1736" data-end="1742">Dune</em>” or “find <em data-start="1753" data-end="1770">The Mandalorian</em>”—and it pulls it up for you. It even scans across multiple apps to tell you which service actually has the thing you’re searching for, which saves you from the endless “which app did I watch that on?” guessing game.</p>


<h2 data-start="1513" data-end="1986">Cloud-based Gaming</h2>
<p data-start="1988" data-end="2503">Another neat perk that’s becoming more and more practical: you can actually play cloud-streamed Xbox games through it. If you’ve got Game Pass Ultimate, you don’t need an Xbox console at all—the cloud streaming service lets you play straight on your Fire Stick as long as your internet isn’t terrible. It’s kind of wild being able to fire up games like <em data-start="2321" data-end="2334">Animal Well</em> or <em data-start="2338" data-end="2374">Indiana Jones and the Great Circle</em> on something only marginally larger than pack of gum. As long as your Wi-Fi is steady, the whole experience is way smoother than you’d expect. And now with&nbsp;<em>Red Dead Redemption 2&nbsp;</em>coming to a number of services including Netflix, now’s a great time to experiment with cloud gaming.</p>
