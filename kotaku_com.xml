              <p>The latest batch of games joining Sony’s PS Plus subscription library in December 2025 has been revealed and it’s not a bad haul. In fact, it has one of the more overlooked JRPGs of the last few years on it: <a href="https://kotaku.com/granblue-fantasy-relink-review-pc-1851209297"><em>Granblue Fantasy: Relink</em></a><em>.&nbsp;</em></p> <p>The Cygames-developed spin-off to the popular mobile franchise is part linear anime RPG, part <em>Monster Hunter</em>, and includes some excellent real-time combat thanks to the pedigree of the Platinum Games employees who helped make it. It combines the pacing and strategizing of an MMO boss battle with the responsiveness and ability juggling of a great action game. Plus, it’s multiplayer and includes an extensive end game. All told, it was one of last year’s bigger surprises for me and one I still feel like a lot of people haven’t woken up to.</p>

 <p>Here’s the rest of <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/12/10/playstation-plus-game-catalog-for-december-assassins-creed-mirage-wo-long-fallen-dynasty-skate-story-and-more/">what’s coming this month</a>:</p> <h2>PlayStation Plus Extra And Premium</h2> <ul> <li><em>Assassin’s Creed Mirage</em> | PS5, PS4</li> <li><em>Wo Long: Fallen Dynasty</em> | PS5, PS4</li> <li><em>Skate Story</em> | PS5</li> <li><em>Granblue Fantasy: Relink</em> | PS5, PS4</li> <li><em>Planet Coaster 2</em> | PS5</li> <li><em>Cat Quest III</em> | PS5, PS4</li> <li><em>Lego Horizon Adventures</em> | PS5</li> <li><em>Paw Patrol: Grand Prix</em> | PS5, PS4<strong><br> </strong></li> <li><em>Paw Patrol World</em> | PS5, PS4</li> </ul> <h2><strong>PlayStation Classics (Premium Only)</strong></h2> <ul> <li><em>Soulcalibur III</em> | PS5, PS4</li> </ul> <p><em>Granblue Fantasy: Relink</em> aside, the main headliners are <a href="https://kotaku.com/assassin-s-creed-mirage-review-ps5-steam-pc-valhalla-1850897175"><em>Assassin’s Creed Mirage</em></a> and <a href="https://kotaku.com/wo-long-fallen-dynasty-review-ps5-soulslike-nioh-sekiro-1850176726"><em>Wo Long: Fallen Dynasty</em></a><em>.</em> Despite launching in 2023, the former recently got a free update that added new story content and additional parkour options, including a dedicated jump. The latter, also from that year, is a Three Kingdoms-based Soulslike from Team Ninja that’s not quite <em>Nioh 2-</em>quality but is still pretty great.</p> <p>Everything above, with the exception of <em>Skate Story</em> which arrived on December 8, joins PS Plus on December 16. That includes<em> Soulcalibur III</em>, arguably the best entry in the fighting game series. It was also the first to let players create their own characters with the Create-A-Soul mode.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Light Up The Town Is The Perfect Cozy Christmas Lights Simulator]]></title>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>I love this time of year. Cozy weather. Tasty cookies and warm cocoa. <a href="https://kotaku.com/anthem-still-hasnt-taken-down-its-christmas-decorations-1841522397">Festive events in games</a>. And of course, all the <a href="https://kotaku.com/mcdonalds-ai-christmas-ad-deleted-comments-removed-bad-2000651791">Christmas</a> lights hanging on houses, businesses, and elsewhere. In particular, I have a soft spot for all the colorful lights that get hung up during December. They just look so magical at night and fill me with nostalgic feelings. What can I say? I’m a sucker for plastic lights.</p> <p>So when I randomly discovered <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3419910/Light_Up_The_Town/"><em>Light Up the Town</em></a>, a newly released cozy indie game all about decorating a wintry small town with Christmas lights, I immediately installed it and happily discovered a wonderful holiday treat that I can’t stop playing.</p>

  <p><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3419910/Light_Up_The_Town/">Out now on Steam, <em>Light Up the Town</em></a> has a super simple premise. You play as a young anthropomorphized ferret named Bean who is going through some stuff. His father, in an effort to lift his spirits, asks Bean to follow in his own footsteps and handle lighting up the entire small Colorado town of Bellflower. If he does this, he’ll get a new bike for Christmas. There’s more going on, but I’ll leave that for you to discover on your own. The narrative isn’t bad at all, but it’s not why you should play <em>Light Up the Town</em>. The real reason is that decorating this snow-covered town with various Christmas lights and decorations is sublime.</p>

 <p>In real life, putting up lights across multiple buildings, roofs, and interiors can be a hassle of tangled cables, extension cords, and broken bulbs. <em>Light Up the Town</em> doesn’t include any of that. Instead, you are able to fling strings of lights in different colors and shapes across large distances like a Christmas Jedi. You can also undo your actions and cut light strings whenever you want, letting you create massively long or incredibly short strings of light. Also, don’t worry about plugs or running cords. Lights just work, regardless of where you put them. Is this realistic? Nope! And I love it. It’s all the joy of hanging lights up and making a home glow without the hassle or headaches the process can create in the real world.</p>

 <figure id="attachment_2000652227" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000652227"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000652227">©Meadow Studios / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p><em>Light Up the Town’</em>s decorating controls are finicky at times, but mostly work great and let you quickly cover areas in lights and other decorations, like presents, candy canes, and more. I recommend playing in first-person mode, but regardless of what view you pick, the end result of putting up all these lights is always magical. The lighting in this game is phenomenal and changes based on how you decorate. Cover a house in just a few white lights? The glow will be softer and dimmer. Fill a room with 20 strings of red and green lights? You’ll create a vibrant Christmas rave. As you hang up lights, look for coins to collect. These can be spent at stores to unlock more varieties of lights and new decoration items.</p> <p>Each time I stepped back after putting up lights for an hour or so, I’d find myself lingering the same way I do in real life when spotting Christmas lights at night. <em>Light Up the Town</em> truly nails the festive and cozy vibes of a cold, dark night in December filled with thousands of tiny bright lights in the snow. For fans of the holiday season, put on your favorite festive songs, make a hot beverage, grab a blanket, and then dive into <em>Light Up the Town.</em>&nbsp;Just set a timer so you don’t spend your whole night decorating.</p>
