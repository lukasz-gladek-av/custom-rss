              <p>Well, the week is nearly at its end and Prime Big Deals Days have come to pass. This was Amazon’s giant Fall sale stretching from October 7 to October 8 in which you could save buttloads on all sorts of cool products you didn’t know you wanted. Had you wished to pick something up this season, but time got away from you, the good news is you’re not out of luck just yet. Some consumer tech products are still on sale. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4688/">Take a gander at this GMKtec Mini PC. It’s usually priced at $240, but this week and still right now it’s come down to only $170. That’s a $70 savings representing 29% of the total price.</a></p>
<p>A quick dive into the specs — this GMKtec Mini PC is working with a 2025 Intel Twin Lake N150 processor with an integrated graphics card. It’s got 12GB of RAM and 512GB of storage on its SSD. The two HDMI ports and DisplayPort will let you plug into up to three monitors at once.</p>

<h2>What’s the Appeal of a Mini PC?</h2>
<p>If you’re not living in the biggest house or apartment, you’ve probably come to know that space is a hot commodity. This is especially true if you’re living with roommates or when living in an already expensive city. That small amount of space you have is precious and you may not be willing to give up a huge chunk of it to a massive PC tower. A mini PC on the other hand offers the versatility of a dedicated desktop PC while only taking up a fraction of the space.</p>



<p>Beyond that, you may find use in using a mini PC as a multimedia player. Tons of modern TVS may already have their built in smart features with apps like Netflix and Hulu, but there is still value in using a mini PC to power your home theater instead. These are full-on Windows devices, which means they can support a much wider range of formats than you are on a smart TV natively or via a streaming stick — especially for locally save files you’ve a acquired through 100% legal means.</p>
<p>On that note, a mini PC makes for an excellent PLEX server, allowing you to access your media files from anywhere. Plus they are great for turning into an emulation machine for retro games due to the low amount of processing power needed for ROMs. Again, just make sure they are games you already 100% legally own.</p>

              <p><em>War of the Worlds</em> will inevitably go down as 2025’s worst film, with its coveted <a href="https://www.metacritic.com/movie/war-of-the-worlds-2025/">Metascore of 6</a> and <a href="https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/war_of_the_worlds_2025">Rotten Tomato rating of 4</a>. But if you thought that might mean the end of sci-fi movies based around surveillance footage, boy do I have a trailer for you. The first promo for Chris Pratt’s&nbsp;<em>MERCY</em> just dropped, and it stinks worse than sewage-filled socks.</p> <p>I love/hate&nbsp;<em>everything</em> about this trailer. The central premise is so stunningly stupid: a near-future world where people are tried for crimes by an AI via, um, strapping them into a chair in the middle of a colossal auditorium and then having them scour all surveillance, mobile and TV footage for proof of their innocence, but only with the run-time of a movie to do it all in. Should they fail to evidence their own lack of guilt in 90 minutes, they’re instantly murdered. It’s as stupid as a hundred ’80s Arnie movies put together, but delivered without a wink of irony.</p>

  <p>LAPD officer (because of course) Pratt has been accused of the murder of his wife. BUT GET THIS! He’s also <em>the very guy</em> who designed the MERCY system! What a piece of screenwriting mastery! Will he learn a valuable life-lesson about authoritarianism? Well, given the trailer begins with a murder mystery and appears to end with car chases and an entire city blowing up, I’m going to guess no.</p>

 <p>Look, I’m mostly ambivalent about boring Chris Pratt. Yes, he’s irritatingly ubiquitous and frustratingly average, and certainly his gross personal views are far from my own, but then I enjoyed him as Starlord and there’s no taking away from his performance in <em>Parks &amp; Recreation</em>. Which is to say, I didn’t head into this trailer with an agenda. I sure came out of it with one! And I’m not even sure what I think about the usually excellent Rebecca Ferguson after this shitshow. She’s playing an AI, sure, but oh my goodness, even the current awful LLMs have more personality than is on display here.</p>

 <p>This really has everything. A woman fridged from before the film even starts; a cold, calculating female antagonist faced off against by the big, buff man; a countdown clock for literally no possible reason; animated percentages measuring guilt popping up like scores in a game; and just some of the most excruciating dialogue you could hope for. “I shouldn’t be here! I helped <em>create</em> the MERCY program!” “Do you honestly think that I killed my wife, or were you just programmed wrong?” Glorious stuff.</p>

 <p>But what I’m enjoying most of all is just how much <a href="https://kotaku.com/war-of-the-worlds-amazon-prime-review-2000616263">it reminds me of&nbsp;<em>War of the Worlds</em> 2025</a>. Those same faux-surveillance camera angles, the crappy quality phone footage, actors trying to do naturalistic while sounding like elementary school nativity performances (I’m talking to you, Jamie McBride). The only disappointment is that Pratt’s clamped into that chair so he can’t get up and rattle a glass door. Can you imagine being in the editing suite for this movie when Amazon drops its ultra-stinker, and realizing that all you’re going get is grim comparisons.</p>

 <p>Perhaps Chris Pratt was just tired of all the running and jumping, and wanted to make a movie where he just got to have a sit down? Fair play to that. And look, I’m willing to admit I can be wrong. I am, after all, the person who (oh God, why can’t I just delete it?) wrote the post, “<a href="https://kotaku.com/war-of-the-worlds-amazon-prime-ice-cube-movie-trailer-1851786939"><em>War of the Worlds</em> Via Found Footage Looks Like A Good Time”</a>. I’m really hoping this is the yang to that yin, and this time I’m ensuring that&nbsp;<em>MERCY</em> is an all-time classic. It is, after all, from the “Academy Award winning producer of&nbsp;<em>Oppenheimer</em>“!</p>

 <p>Well, um,&nbsp;<em>sort of</em>. One of the listed producers of <em>MERCY</em>, Charles Roven, was a producer on <em>Oppenheimer</em> and that movie won Best Picture. So, technically? But far better, <em>MERCY</em>‘s director, Timur Bekmambetov (best known for the wildly overrated&nbsp;<em>Night Watch</em> and&nbsp;<em>Day Watch</em>), was a producer on&nbsp;<em>War of the Worlds</em>! Yay! Why wasn’t&nbsp;<em>that</em> mentioned in the trailer?!</p> <p>It’s out in theaters January 23, 2026, although I rather strongly suspect it won’t be the&nbsp;<em>longest</em> wait before it hits streamers after that.</p>
