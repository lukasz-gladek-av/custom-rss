              <p>There’s no reason for you to spend over $1,000, or even over $500, on a reliable everyday laptop. No, we’re not talking about a refurbished machine or one from a brand hardly anyone’s ever heard of.</p>
<p>We’re bargain hunters, and we just spotted a hard-to-miss deal. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4872/">Amazon is offering the 14-inch Asus Vivobook Full HD laptop for just $480, which is a full 40% off its original price.</a> It was already quite affordable at $800, but grabbing it for less than $500 is practically a steal. Like most good discounts, we don’t expect it to last long, so we recommend grabbing one for yourself sooner rather than later.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4872/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Ultra-Fast Performance for All Your Tasks</h2>
<p>You’re getting a powerful device in a minimal build. It runs on a 10-core Intel Core i5-1334U processor that hits speeds up to 4.6GHz – enough power to get you through your most productive work days without any slowdowns. The processor is thoughtfully paired with 24GB of RAM and a 1TB PCIe SSD, so expect impressive multitasking capabilities and faster boot times. Whether your work requires you to hop between multiple apps at once or you’re just a creative looking to push some boundaries, this machine has you covered. The storage space is also more than enough to house all your essentials, including work files, a ton of movies, all your favorite shows, a couple of games, and much more.</p>



<p>The display is a 14-inch screen with a 1920×1080 resolution and ultra-narrow bezels. It’s not too big, but you also won’t feel cramped while working, streaming, or browsing. The display also isn’t too heavy on the eyes, so you won’t be left with eye strain at the end of the day. There’s also a solid 720p front camera that makes sure you look your best during video calls.</p>
<p>Those who are out and about often will appreciate the reliable battery life. You’re looking at up to 8 hours of usage on a single charge, meaning you can get through an entire workday without worrying about plugging it in.</p>
<p>Best of all, your purchase also includes a free 4-in-1 accessory kit with a Type-C extension cable, Type-C to HDMI cable, mousepad, and a cleaning cloth. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4872/">All of this is valued at $40, but you’re getting it included at no extra cost. Grab the deal before it sells out or Amazon pushes the price back to $800.</a></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><span>You know, about 24 hours ago I had every intention of pitching a post for </span><i><span>Kotaku</span></i><span> about how I could finally forgive </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-tcg-pocket-celestial-guardians-alolan-raichu-1851777665"><span>Alolan Raichu</span></a><span>, the surfing, psychic, pancake-loving regional variant of my favorite Pokémon, for its crimes. For many years, I have looked upon Alolan Raichu with disdain as it usurped the Kanto original as The Pokémon Company’s favorite Pikachu evolution. The Alolan mouse was featured in </span><i><span>Super Smash Bros. Ultimate</span></i><span>, is a playable character in the MOBA </span><i><span>Pokémon Unite</span></i><span>, and received some significant promo in the anime and </span><i><span>Sun </span></i><span>and </span><i><span>Moon</span></i><span>. Meanwhile, my boy’s legacy </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-raichu-alolan-pikachu-anime-1851011570"><span>has mostly seen him overshadowed by his own pre-evolution</span></a><span>, and this all began with an episode of the anime that painted him as inferior to Pikachu in battle decades ago. Then, Game Freak announced he was getting not one, but </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-legends-z-a-mega-evolution-list-new-all-switch-2000621380"><span>two Mega Evolutions</span></a><span> in </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-legends-z-a-mega-raichu-evolution-x-y-paid-dlc-2000625371"><i><span>Legends: Z-A</span></i><span>’s DLC</span></a><span>. For a moment, it seemed Raichu would finally get some respect put on his name. I’d decided I could finally forgive Alolan Raichu for stealing the spotlight and let the electric rats coexist in my mind…until this little shit showed up in </span><i><span>Legends: Z-A</span></i><span> with the audacity of someone who’s never been told “no” in his life.</span></p> <p><span>If you’re wondering where Alolan Raichu is in <em>Legends: Z-A</em>, know it is only available in the post-game. I hadn’t given the regional variant much thought until I was heading to do a quest in Lumiose City. There I was, walking toward the Quasartico Inc. building minding my own business, Raichu by my side, when all of a sudden, I see this agitating, dopey, maple-syrup-smelling twerp hovering alongside a woman on the way in. “Pshaw!” I say in my mind as the side quest marker hovers above them, as if inviting me to inquire about this odd-looking rodent when I have spent 30 hours having only seen Raichus that are orange and have their feet planted firmly on the ground. I know who you are, Alolan Raichu, and you’re a war criminal. But then I think, maybe if I do this side quest, they’ll go away and I won’t have to see them next time I come to Quasartico’s office. So I speak to the woman. She introduces herself as Griddella, a member of CHARGE, or “Committee to Highlight Alolan Raichu and Generate Excitement.” I guess even serial killers have fandoms.</span></p>

 <figure id="attachment_2000637260" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000637260"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000637260">© The Pokémon Company / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p><span>Griddella asks if our Raichus can battle, and she wants to make some ceremony of it. I have to remove all my other Pokémon from my party before I can complete the quest, so it’s just me and Raichu against Griddella and the Pocket Monster equivalent of Bizarro from </span><i><span>Superman</span></i><span>. The Alolan Raichu we face is decently powerful at level 64, but my guy’s at level 70 and we just finished the endgame, so we’ve faced much tougher foes than this imposter. Raichu smacks Alolan Raichu around the field a bit and then Griddella congratulates us on our win. Alright, cool. Kanto Raichu supremacy has been established. Let’s get back to what we were doing, Raichu. But no, Griddella’s not done with us yet, as she then asks a baffling question: “Let’s trade: your Raichu for my Alolan Raichu! What do you say?”</span></p> <p><span>What do I say, Griddella? I say “Hell fucking no, are you kidding me?” But the game only lets me say “No thanks,” so you will never hear the disgust with which I decline your insult of an offer. Not only have I gone to hell and back with this guy throughout </span><i><span>Legends: Z-A</span></i><span>’s story, but he also just whooped your faker’s ass in the middle of a crowded area of Lumiose City. Why would I reward my king’s loyalty and strength by giving him to you for this second-rate phony? He’s been with me since Day One, and we have journeyed through every region of the </span><i><span>Pokémon </span></i><span>universe together, saving the day while this guy serves pancakes to people in Alola. When the </span><i><span>Mega Dimension </span></i><span>DLC comes out, he’s finally going to undergo Mega Evolution like he should have a decade ago. The Pokémon Company may not respect him, but I do. I’ll never trade my OG for a pretender. Even if it means I’ve gotta see him every time I go to Quasartico’s building because they will not leave unless I make the trade. Guess that quest’s not getting finished. “Ken, just catch another Raichu and trade it.” No! It’s the principle!</span></p>

              <p>If you’re out there making content for TikTok or Instagram Reels, there’s one small change you can implement to your work that will make a world of difference. Get a microphone. Seriously. Creators underestimate the importance of good audio. Whether you’re filming simple vlogs from the comfort of your couch or conducting one of those man-on-the-street styled interviews. Those watching are going to notice your sound quality. They may not even be directly aware of it, but on an unconscious level, they might get the feeling your content seems subpar, but can’t exactly point to why. 9 times out of 10, it’s the audio. Nip that in the bud with a set high-quality lavalier microphone that’s on sale.<a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4871/"> Right now, the DJI Mic Mini two-person vlog bundle is down 34%, bringing the price from $119 top just $79.</a> I don’t know about you, but saving $40 sound pretty good to me.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4871/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Tiny But Mighty</h2>
<p>These wireless microphones are low-profile without sacrificing quality. They are ultralight, weighing only 10 grams. They are discreet and aesthetically pleasing on camera, plus they’re easy and comfortable to wear.</p>
<p>Each mic is capable of delivering high-quality sound to the receiver at a maximum transmission range of up to 400 meters. That’s a quarter mile away from the receiver you can be.</p>



<p>They’re great for recording in bustling outdoor environments like a busy street or a crowded convention. That’s because each mic is capable of pro-level noise cancelling. It can be set to two different mode of intensity. Basic is good for quiet indoor settings while the strong mode is ideal when outside in a noisy environment. They are also able to automatically limit the volume input if it detects the sound being too high. This prevents clipping and can be an absolute lifesaver when it comes to editing your content.</p>
<p>The DJI Mic Minis can be connected to your own greater DJI OsmoAudio ecosystem. pair them easily with an Osmo Action 5 Pro without even needing the receiver.</p>
<p>Each transmitter and receiver come with a long battery life so you can stay out there and film for as long as you need for the day. The DJI Mic Minis offer a maximum operating time of up to 10 hours on a single charge. Great for interviews and livestreaming that may go on for a while.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4871/">Right now, you can get this bundle of two DJI Mic Mini microphones and their DJI receiver for a discounted price of just $79, saving your $40.</a></p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/jbl-clip-3-bluetooth-speaker-finally-drops-to-an-almost-free-price-after-months-without-a-discount-2000636703</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/jbl-clip-3-bluetooth-speaker-finally-drops-to-an-almost-free-price-after-months-without-a-discount.1329421/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>A good Bluetooth speaker is one of those things that everyone should just have. Whether you’re heading to the park with some friends and planning to listen to some music while you hang or are just at home folding laundry and catching up on the latest episode of your favorite podcast, you’re gonna want a solid speaker. The JBL Clip 3 isn’t the latest model, but it still produces quality sound at an inexpensive price point. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4870/">Amazon has the Bluetooth speaker on sale right now so you can get one for 16% off</a>. It’s normally listed at $45, but for a limited time you can grab yours for just $38. That’s not too steep of a savings, but hey, $7 is still $7.</p>
<p>JBL has a built a name for itself in the world of portable Bluetooth speakers. With the JBL Clip 3, you can expect big sound from a small speaker that can clip onto your bag or belt. Yes, that’s where the name comes from. This ultra-compact speaker has a carabiner clip built into the side of it so you can hang it on your person or perhaps the back of your beach chair so it doesn’t have to sit in the sand.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4870/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Bring Great Sound Anywhere</h2>
<p>Take it to the beach or even poolside as the JBL Clip 3 is waterproof. No need to worry about a little splash, spill, or rain. Heck, the whole thing can even be fully immersed in water and come out fine. The exterior is made with a durable fabric material and a rugged rubber house to protect it, even if it gets dropped onto hard concrete.</p>
<p>Battery life is reliably long. It wouldn’t be that great of a portable speaker if it had to spend most of its time plugged into an outlet. Well, the rechargeable lithium ion battery can hold onto a full 10 hours of playtime on a single charge.</p>



<p>If you want to take a call form your phone, you can do so while connected to the Bluetooth speaker. The JBL Clip 3 even has noise and echo-cancelling so when using it as a speaker phone, the folks on the other end will be able to hear you crystal clear.</p>
<p>JBL speakers come in a large assortment of colors and the JBL Clip 3 is no different. A couple are out of stock, but you can still pick between gray, blue, red, sand, white, yellow, green or even camo patterns in both black or green. All of which are currently on sale for the low price of just $38.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/emiru-twitchcon-assault-video-cosplay-streamer-2000637226</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/famous-cosplay-streamer-says-it%E2%80%99s-%E2%80%98definitely-my-last-twitchcon%E2%80%99-after-shocking-assault-goes-viral.1329391/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Emily “Emiru” Schunk says she’s pressing charges and won’t be returning to TwitchCon after being assaulted by an attendee in a security lapse that’s bringing renewed scrutiny to Twitch’s safety and security policies for its biggest event of the year. “Twitch security is nowhere near me,” she said in a statement after the incident went viral on social media. “I can see them, but they don’t do anything.”</p> <p>Emiru, an online creator with over a million subscribers best known for <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3pwSsUVn3Ws">her cosplay livestreams</a>, was in the middle of a fan Meet and Greet at TwitchCon 2025 over the weekend when a man seemingly cut in line and grabbed her before leaning in toward her face. Footage shows her personal security running over to grab the individual and get him away from Emiru, at which point the man walks away from the Meet and Greet area.</p>

 <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">So some freak just assaulted Emiru at <a href="https://twitter.com/TwitchCon?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@TwitchCon</a> . This behavior is fucking disgusting. I’m amazed that she still came back to finish the Meet and Greet line, honestly she deserves the utmost of respect. THIS HAS TO STOP!!!<a href="https://twitter.com/EmiruUpdatess?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@EmiruUpdatess</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/emiru?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@emiru</a> <a href="https://t.co/pyO2QHQ9Pv">pic.twitter.com/pyO2QHQ9Pv</a></p> <p>— BaconCrumbz 🥓 @TwitchCon SD (@BaconCrumbz) <a href="https://twitter.com/BaconCrumbz/status/1979387279149068577?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 18, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <p>She said her first thought when the assault occurred was that it may have been a Twitch staff member coming to tell her something about the event but once he grabbed her she knew something was wrong. “I’m still, like, freaked out because he grabbed me,” Emiru <a href="https://x.com/emiru/status/1979602519967060414?">said in a video</a> released after the event. “That’s not normal. And then he grabs my face and he leans in and lips puckered tries to kiss me and I start screaming. You can’t hear it in the clip, but I’m fucking screaming my head off.”</p>

 <h2>Emiru claims Twitch lied</h2> <p>But as bad as the initial incident was, Emiru said Twitch’s response to what happened is what’s made her angrier. “I’m obviously shaken up by what happened and it’s not the first time I’ve dealt with something like this, but to tell you honestly, I am a lot more hurt and upset by how Twitch handled it during and after the fact.” She claimed that Twitch’s first move was to ban the suspect from the platform for 30 days, and it was only after her manager pressed the Amazon-owned platform that it made it a lifetime ban from Twitch and TwitchCon.</p>

 <p>“The safety and security of all those attending TwitchCon is our highest priority,” the company <a href="https://x.com/Twitch/status/1979464697364779065?t=tjsgoIXfiG7ec7GXK6uuOg&amp;s=19">wrote in a statement</a> over the weekend. “The behavior displayed by the individual involved in the incident yesterday involving a high profile streamer was completely unacceptable and deeply upsetting.” Emiru also took issue with Twitch’s framing of its response, claiming that no one from security immediately tracked down the suspect to escort him out of the convention.</p>

  <p>“In line with existing TwitchCon security protocols, law enforcement and event security were on site and responded to the incident,” the company’s statement read. “We immediately blocked this individual from returning to the TwitchCon premises, and they are banned indefinitely from Twitch, both online and in-person events.” The statement, published on X, has since been community-noted by Emiru’s fans.</p> <h2>The TwitchCon fallout</h2> <p>The incident comes in the wake of the <a href="https://kotaku.com/charlie-kirk-shooter-discord-politics-helldivers-memes-2000626029">Charlie Kirk assassination</a> earlier this year that left some of Twitch and YouTube’s most famous content creators afraid that they could be targeted at public events by violent actors or unhinged fans. Korean TikToker and livestreamer Yoon Ji-ah <a href="https://www.dexerto.com/tiktok/korean-streamer-murdered-after-arguing-with-vip-viewer-who-donated-70000-to-her-3264111/">was murdered earlier this year</a> by a stalker who had allegedly donated roughly $70,000 to her under the user alias “‘Black Cat.”</p> <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">This was my 12th TwitchCon and I’m not going to lie it might have been my last. I love seeing friends but it really just doesn’t feel the same. After seeing what happened this weekend I feel better about canceling my meet n greet and going home early</p> <p>— Lulu (@LuluLuvely) <a href="https://twitter.com/LuluLuvely/status/1980015610689171867?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 19, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <p>“Do you know how much I spent on security to be able to come to this event in the first place?” Emiru said in her latest video. “I’m not just talking about yesterday. I’m talking about my security for like my RV trip that I did with my friends and stuff. I spent over $10,000. Some people who stream on Twitch don’t even make $10,000 in a year. What the fuck are they supposed to do? Like if you watch the clip, the security guard who pushes the guy away is my security. The woman who pulls me to the back, my manager. If you’re a small streamer and you don’t have those resources or&nbsp;someone in your line’s not filming, what the fuck do you do? No one would have known.”</p>  <p>The streamer said Twitch had multiple representatives from Amazon speak with her following the incident but it’s not exactly clear yet how Twitch will revamp security. Multiple high-profile female streamers had previously <a href="https://www.dexerto.com/twitch/pokimane-valkyrae-qtcinderella-afraid-to-attend-twitchcon-due-to-safety-concerns-3255650/">shared their fears</a> about attending the event. “It does worry me that it might not be safe and it’d be better to skip out on it,” Imane “Pokimane” Anys told her viewers last month. The comment was in response to both Rachell “Valkyrae” Hofstetter and Blaire “QTCinderella” voicing their own concerns. So far at least, Twitch has only proven just how founded those fears were.</p>

            <p><span>If you’ve played any of the </span><i><span>Pokémon</span></i><span> games, you know the series is a heavily iterative one. Each new game makes some notable (or not so notable) strides over the last that build on, rather than overhaul, what came before.&nbsp; But each new game also finds ways of departing significantly from its predecessors, giving them all their own strengths and weaknesses. This is especially true of </span><i><span>Pokémon Legends: Z-A</span></i><span>, which is one of the most significant departures from the old formula that Game Freak has ever put out. So let’s run down the best and worst parts of each </span><i><span>Pokémon</span></i><span> game, starting with the original Game Boy games.</span></p>
