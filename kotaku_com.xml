            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Square Enix is currently in the middle of a reboot. Following a bunch of flops (<a href="https://kotaku.com/foamstars-review-splatoon-ps5-is-it-good-square-enix-1851239389">remember<em> Foamstars</em></a>?) and some great games held back by timed exclusivity (<em>Final Fantasy XVI</em>, <em>Final Fantasy VII Rebirth</em>), the RPG publisher has been pivoting to a <a href="https://kotaku.com/square-enix-business-plan-multiplatform-1851472456">multiplatform approach and retooling its slate of upcoming releases</a>. It’s also, apparently, making a big push into leveraging generative AI. The company announced a new goal of having 70 percent of quality assurance and game debugging work handled by generative AI by 2027.</p> <p>“Through the use of automation technology, [we] aim to improve the efficiency of QA operations and establish a competitive advantage in game development,” reads <a href="https://www.hd.square-enix.com/eng/ir/pdf/20251106_01_en.pdf">a new presentation</a> updating investors on Square Enix’s business strategy (via <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/square-enix-says-it-wants-generative-ai-to-be-doing-70-of-its-qa-and-debugging-by-the-end-of-2027/"><em>VGC</em></a>). The project developed out of an AI-themed “idea contest” the company held, and will be part of a joint research initiative with Matsuo Laboratory at the University of Tokyo. Is this a real plan or just a way to impress investors with buzzwords?</p>

 <p>Square Enix isn’t the only company trying to apply generative AI tools to QA. While some companies <a href="https://kotaku.com/black-ops-7-generative-ai-call-duty-gamescom-2025-slop-2000618833">get lampooned</a> for letting AI slop infest concept art or even finished loading screens that appear in the game, <a href="https://kotaku.com/xbox-microsoft-matt-booty-qa-crunch-ai-mistreatment-1849496926">others have argued</a> that the job of discovering and documenting bugs is one where LLM technology will be most useful. An AI data firm <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/report-30-of-game-devs-believe-ai-will-play-an-extremely-important-role-in-qa-testing">claimed earlier this year</a> that 30 percent of respondents to a developer survey believed AI would play an “extremely important role” in QA testing.</p>

 <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">I'm convinced that statement from Square is to just get shareholders excited, because what is GenAi really gonna say when something like this pops up? Can it even critically understand what it's looking at to report the issue accurately? <a href="https://t.co/VJ5r67Fu27">pic.twitter.com/VJ5r67Fu27</a></p> <p>— Del (@TheCartelDel) <a href="https://twitter.com/TheCartelDel/status/1986413587561390345?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 6, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <p>But will it actually be any good or save studios time and money? Veteran game artist Del Walker pointed out a recent bug in <em>Marvel Rivals</em> by which a costume completely breaks a character’s model during certain animations. “What is GenAi really gonna say when something like this pops up?” he wrote <a href="https://x.com/TheCartelDel/status/1986413587561390345">on X</a>. “Can it even critically understand what it’s looking at to report the issue accurately?”</p>

 <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/activision-blizzard-s-qa-department-seems-like-a-hellho-1847473158">Quality assurance</a> has long been at the bottom of the hierarchy when it comes to game development prestige and pay, despite bugs and glitches being the first things to go viral during a game launch, setting the tone of how big-budget games are perceived. They can also make or break its initial reception if things are particularly bad. <em>Fallout 76</em> was particularly bad when it first released and was infamous early on for important updates that found new ways to accidentally break the game.</p> <p>QA, in other words, is very important, but it can also be very labor intensive. If we know one thing about companies its that they love results and hate having to pay people to produce them. It’s easy to envision a way forward where developers on the studio floor are able to experiment with new tools and see whether they work before committing to ambitious goals that replace expertise with automation. That probably doesn’t sound as good in a PowerPoint presentation, though.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Hello and welcome back to Morning Checkpoint, <em>Kotaku’s</em> daily round-up of interesting news and other stuff you might care about. It’s weird to me that<a href="https://kotaku.com/gremlins-3-announced-2027-speilberg-call-of-duty-sequel-chris-columbus-2000641675"> WB is making a <em>Gremlins 3</em></a>, but hey, if it features a lot of gross puppets bouncing around like cartoon maniacs, I’ll be there day one to enjoy it. Anyway, today we have news about a <em>Roblox</em> movie, <em>Overcooked</em> is becoming a reality show, and the story of an NBA player who kicked ass to spite a kid he met in a video game.</p> <h2><strong>NBA player was heckled in <em>NBA 2K26</em> and then scored 46 points as revenge</strong></h2> <p>On Wednesday night, Cleveland Cavaliers guard Donovan Mitchell had a great game against the Philadelphia 76ers, scoring 46 points and eight assists to help the Cavs grab a victory. When asked afterward about his performance, Mitchell revealed that he played so well because he was taunted by someone, possibly a kid, while playing<em> NBA 2K26</em>. <a href="https://x.com/CultureCrave/status/1986382376843551086">Here’s what he said</a>, according to CBS Sports:</p>

 <blockquote><p>You have moments where it’s like–obviously, you play this game and you’re trying to win–but this was just a cool day as a whole for me. And obviously, to have the night I had was definitely special as well. But I wouldn’t put the game I had based on the court.</p> <p>This kid pissed me off today, I was playing <em>2K.</em> I had been playing <em>2K</em> for like two hours, and I told him, too, I said ‘Just wait.’ He called me ‘Washed up,’ he called me a bunch of things. But I love it. He said he hadn’t seen a highlight from me in a minute. I just told him, ‘alright, we’ll see.’ He told me to ‘go to sleep.’ He was going in. So this game was for that kid or grown man or whoever that was. So I appreciate you. I told him I’d give him a shoutout, too. So that’s what tonight was…</p></blockquote> <h2><strong>Yup, Hollywood is making a <em>Roblox</em> movie</strong></h2> <p>Production company <a href="https://deadline.com/2025/11/grow-a-garden-movie-story-kitchen-in-development-1236608058/">Story Kitchen announced</a> that it is now developing a feature film based on the hit <em>Roblox</em> game <em>Grow a Garden, </em><a href="https://kotaku.com/grow-a-garden-roblox-5-million-active-users-record-pc-1851781824">one of the most popular user-created games</a> available in the free-to-play online metaverse for kids. At one point, <em>Grow a Garden</em> had over 20 million concurrent users, making it one of the most popular video games on the planet and beating everything on Steam.</p>

 <p>“<em>Grow a Garden</em> is exactly the kind of imaginative, heartfelt world we love to adapt,” said Story Kitchen co-founders Dmitri M. Johnson and Michael Lawrence Goldberg, “an uplifting story-world rooted in play, creativity, and community.” No release date for this one, and considering that Story Kitchen is already working on a slew of other video game adaptations–including <em>Split Fiction, It Takes Two, Sifu, Shinobi, </em>and <em>Toejam and Earl</em>–but has yet to complete and release most of them, I’m not holding my breath that this actually gets made. But we shall see.</p>

 <h2><strong>Netflix working on reality cooking show based on <em>Overcooked</em></strong></h2> <p>Speaking of video games getting turned into movies and TV shows, <a href="https://deadline.com/2025/11/overcooked-reality-competition-series-video-game-netflix-a24-1236608072/">Netflix has announced that it is working with A24</a> to develop a reality cooking show competition based on the hit co-op cooking game <em>Overcooked</em>. The game’s original devs are involved, and it’s reportedly going to be similar to Netflix’s other popular cooking shows, like <em>Nailed It.</em> While I enjoyed <em>Overcooked</em>, the game is nearly a decade old at this point, and it feels like perhaps Netflix waited too long to do something with it.</p> <h2><strong><em>Marvel Rivals</em> reveals new heroes via sneaky patch notes tease</strong></h2> <p><a href="https://www.polygon.com/marvel-rivals-rogue-gambit-patch-notes/">As spotted by <em>Polygon</em></a>, on Wednesday, <em>Marvel Rivals</em> developer NetEase Games <a href="https://www.marvelrivals.com/gameupdate/20251105/41548_1269153.html">posted some patch notes</a> for the popular hero shooter. And if you look closely at the top image of the post, you’ll spot what looks like Rogue and Gambit, two famous X-Men characters, hidden in the artwork. These heroes have been rumored to be coming to the game for some time now, alongside many others, so it’s not shocking that it looks like these two mutants will be making the leap to <em>Rivals</em> in the near future.</p> <h2>ICYMI:</h2> <ul> <li><a href="https://kotaku.com/gta-6-leaks-delay-developers-fired-rockstar-games-union-2000641525">Rockstar claims fired devs were leaking secrets</a></li> <li><a href="https://kotaku.com/sonics-latest-outing-is-a-grim-fall-guys-knock-off-with-60-skins-2000641427">The new <em>Sonic</em> game suuuuuccccckkkks</a></li> <li><a href="https://kotaku.com/battlefield-6-drone-glitch-fix-patch-ruining-matches-update-2000641355"><em>Battlefield 6′</em>s drone glitch is still causing problems, but a fix is coming soon</a></li> </ul> <h2>Watch This:</h2>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/arc-raiders-roadmap-new-map-patch-barricade-2000641734</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/arc-raiders-has-a-big-roadmap-and-a-new-update-but-fans-want-some-things-kept-secret.1345903/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Last week, developer Embark Studios published their 2025<i> Arc Raiders</i> roadmap detailing what’s coming to the PvPvE extraction shooter through the rest of November and&nbsp; December. This includes a newly revealed 1.1.0 update that went live today, with some features arriving this weekend. But while fans are chiming in with requests for new features, some also want <i>Arc Raiders</i> to keep some surprises up its sleeves.</p> <p>Here’s where things stand in the massive hit multiplayer shooter a week since launch. Also, I have an epic video of someone taking down a Bastion with a pickaxe at the end. But first the game’s latest set of patch notes:</p> <h2>Patch 1.1.0 updates and changes</h2> <p>Thursday<a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1808500/view/590661232047948062?l=english">’s 1.1.0 patch notes</a> detail some welcome quality-of-life changes, as well as a sneak peak of what’s dropping into the game on November 8 .</p>

 <p>Over the weekend, <i>Arc Raiders</i> will see three new map conditions arrive. For the uninitiated, map conditions change up what you can expect while out on the battlefield. For example, a “Lush Blooms” condition on a map means that you can expect more plant life and more fruits to harvest than normal.</p>

 <p>Following the latest update, Hidden Bunker, Electromagnetic Storm, and a Night Raid in Blue Gate will be added to the game. Hidden Bunker, as you can imagine, is a hidden loot spot you’ll have to unlock. Electromagnetic Storm (which was available during the Server Slam) sees deadly lightning strikes pose a risk to anyone on the map–maybe fire up some <i>Final Fantasy X</i> to prepare yourself?</p>

 <p>Right now, however, folks can expect the following tweaks to <i>Arc Raiders</i>’ gameplay:</p> <ul> <li aria-level="1">Fixed the issue where the Integrated Shield Recharger was only recharging when equipped.</li> <li aria-level="1">Fixed an issue where Augment skills sometimes did not work.</li> <li aria-level="1">Fixed exploit using deployables pushing players through walls.</li> <li aria-level="1">Added a charge progress for Integrated Shield repair.</li> <li aria-level="1">Fixed an issue where Health Regen skills wouldn’t work if they were triggered while DBNO.</li> <li aria-level="1">Fixed the bug where the Well-Travelled achievement wouldn’t register.</li> <li aria-level="1">Barricades can no longer be placed near zipline exit points.</li> <li aria-level="1">Added the Punch Hands emote (preorder bonus) in game.</li> <li aria-level="1">Changed the schedule so new Map Conditions become available Saturday.</li> </ul> <p>The most significant of these is the inability to plant a barricade in front of a zipline exit. Barricades are really generous with where they can be placed, letting you effectively block off doors. It seemed like only a matter of before this exploit was nerfed.</p>

 <h2><i>Arc Raiders</i>’ roadmap details a new map, new gear, and snow!</h2> <p><a href="https://arcraiders.com/en/news/2025-roadmap/">Later on in November</a>, folks can expect a new map to unlock the currently inaccessible “Stella Montis.” There’s also some new Arc enemies on the way called the “Matriarch” and “Shredder.” There will also be some new quests, and new guns with which to take them on.</p>

  <p>The December updates, however, sound even cooler. The maps will experience snow as a new environmental condition and the game’s first expedition departure window will open up.</p>

 <p>What’s an expedition? Instead of a global server wipe that nukes everyone’s gear, <i>Arc Raiders</i> has a unique seasonal mechanic that encourages you to invest a ton of gathered loot into a “Project” to build a caravan. Once you finish it, and once there’s an expedition departure window available, you can send your Raider out on a permanent expedition, allowing you to start up a new one.</p> <p>This will reset all your skill points and clear out your stash, as well as your workshop upgrades. You’ll keep all your cosmetics and your new Raider will also get an XP boost, extra materials from our pal Scrappy, easier weapon repairs, and more space in your stash.</p> <p>Most survival games have some kind of mechanic for wiping everyone’s progress, otherwise the game would just turn into a warzone of folks perpetually hoarding and stocking up on their best gear forever. We’ll see if this one can help make <i>Arc Raiders</i> palatable to casual players where other hardcore extraction shooters like <i>Escape from Tarkov</i> have failed.</p>

 <p>If you’re working on your Caravan right now, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ArcRaiders/comments/1opk2ti/psa_for_all_raiders_dont_scrap_these_items/">OrganicAppointment43 on Reddit has kindly shared</a> a list of every piece of loot you’ll need to put it together:</p>   <h2>Fans still want some surprises kept secret</h2> <p>Since the early preview tests of the game, many fans have been asking for quality-of-life features like the ability to craft more of an item directly from a right-click submenu without diving into the various workshop submenus. One thing it seems many fans <i>don’t</i> want, however, is to know about future Arc enemies.</p>

   <p>“It would be very cool if new ARC just started appearing randomly,” <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ArcRaiders/comments/1op9f2e/please_embark_keep_new_arc_units_secret/">a popular post on the game’s</a> subreddit says. Some players basically want the game to mimic <i>Helldivers 2</i>’s more organic way of evolving in which the developers don’t explicitly telegraph every change ahead of time.</p> <p>I have to echo this sentiment. So much of what makes a match of <i>Arc Raiders</i> fun is when the “unknown” happens: A Leaper arrives when you weren’t expecting it, a Tick jumps down on your face in true <i>Alien</i> facehugger fashion from a hiding spot you never anticipated, and so on. We know we’re getting two new Arc this month, but it sure would be nice if a few of the future ones remained a little hidden and were rolled out in secret.</p> <h2>Behold: Someone took down a Bastion with a friggin’ Pickaxe</h2> <p>If you’ve played any amount of <i>Arc Raiders</i>, you know your pickaxe is essential for breaking into caches and can prove a deadly melee weapon in a pinch. But as Reddit user NotaFTCAgent demonstrates, it can also deliver <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ArcRaiders/comments/1onselo/last_night_i_had_my_lowest_low_so_far_lost_all_my/">a satisfying final blow to a friggin Bastion</a>:</p>    <p>Call him <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ArcRaiders/comments/1onselo/comment/nmz5994/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button">John of Arc</a>, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ArcRaiders/comments/1onselo/comment/nn1baqv/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button">Marc Raider</a>, or <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ArcRaiders/comments/1onselo/comment/nn1s9q3/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button">THOR with Mjolnir</a>, the dude needs a medal for that one.</p>
