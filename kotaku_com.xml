              <p>You don’t have to spend thousands on a new laptop, especially if you’re just after an everyday machine for casual work and home use. If you’re shopping for one today, we’ve got great news.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6631/">Amazon, very generously, has dropped the price of the 14-inch HP computer in Silver to just $300, after taking a massive 35% off its usual price.</a> Your purchase will come with a free 8-in-1 hub, as well as a one-year subscription to Microsoft Office 365; both of which add even more value to the current offer. It’s one of the lowest we have seen this model drop to, but as you’d expect, the discount ends soon. Be sure to snap it up fast.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6631/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Decent Performance for Regular Tasks</h2>
<p>We won’t sugarcoat it; this laptop is not a powerhouse. It’s appropriate for home use like simple browsing, streaming, video calling, and some basic work tasks. We won’t exactly recommend it to work professionals, but it’s a good pick for seniors who want their own device or kids who are just getting started. You’re getting a modest 14-inch HD display that delivers decent visuals for all your needs. The anti-glare coating makes it easy on the eyes and keeps the picture quality consistent across all lighting conditions. You can view the screen comfortably in daylight (while soaking up some sun), as well as in dim settings after the shadows fall.</p>
<p>The 4GB DDR4 RAM isn’t made for heavy-duty multitasking, but it does a good job of keeping everything running smoothly, as long as you’re not trying to push some creative boundaries. There’s 128GB flash storage, which is nicely paired with a 128GB Micro SD to give you a total of 256GB space to save all your files, content, and programs. It’s more than enough to house hundreds of photos, a ton of videos, a few movies to stay entertained on the go, all your favorite songs downloaded, and more. Power comes from the 4-core Intel N150 processor, which hits up to 3.6 GHz with Intel Turbo Boost Technology.</p>



<p>Wireless connectivity comes from Wi-Fi 6 and Bluetooth 5.4, while ports like USB Type-C (10Gbps), two USB Type-A, HDMI 1.4b, and an SD card reader make it easy to connect other peripherals without feeling limited. Windows 11 S also comes pre-installed, so the laptop will be ready to go right out of the box. The highlight here, however, is the one-year subscription to Microsoft 365 Office. This gives you access to premium apps like Word, Excel, PowerPoint, Outlook, OneNote, OneDrive, Teams, and more. You can use these to create documents, be creative with presentations, work on large spreadsheets, and communicate with teams around the world remotely. The subscription typically costs around $100 a year, but you’re getting it here for absolutely free!</p>
<p>All in all, if you’ve been looking to grab a new everyday laptop for regular use, this Amazon deal lets you pick one for basically nothing. Again, it’s not made for heavy-duty work, creative projects, or gaming. It’s designed for basic use, and it does that job quite well. Getting your orders in now will help ensure they reach you before Christmas, which is great if you’re planning to surprise a loved one with a new laptop. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6631/">Additionally, shipping is free, so $300 is all you’ve got to pay today.</a></p>

            <title><![CDATA[Anker’s HDMI Switch Crashes Below $10 With Final Discount, Compatible With TV, Laptop, PC, Xbox, Playstation, Projector, and More]]></title>
            <link>https://kotaku.com/ankers-hdmi-switch-crashes-below-10-with-final-discount-compatible-with-tv-laptop-pc-xbox-playstation-projector-and-more-2000656187</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Don’t look now, but Amazon has this Anker HDMI switch on sale for 38% off. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6623/">That shaves the price down by six whole dollars, bringing the price down from $16 to an even $10.</a></p>
<p>Old hats me remember the dark ages of television inputs. Between my cousins and I, we had an original NES that we kept at our grandmas house. This way we would always have something to do while over. This was when the SNES and even N64 had been out already, so we were retro gamers early on. Anyway, the TV in the backroom with the NES only had one coaxial hookup, which would always be set up to the cable box. It was at the back of the TV which was too heavy for any of us to move, so every visit started with one of us reaching our arm back there blindly to unscrew the cable box cable and then screw in the NES cable.</p>

<p>Since those “switch the input to channel 3,” days, things have gotten much easier, with TVs offering multiple inputs which you can swap between. Though not every modern TV is equipped with enough ports. Maybe you’ve got a cable box, your Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series X. If your TV isn’t packing at least four inputs, then you too will be living in the old days of reaching behind the TV to unplug one console to plug in another.</p>
<h2>HDMI Switching Simplified</h2>
<p>You don’t have to live like this. This is the exact scenario that the Anker HDMI switch was designed for. It has two inputs and one output. Just plug two of your consoles into the front end and out the back plug it into your TV. With just the click of a button, you can swap between either of the two inputs. It’s all hassle-free and you can say goodbye to reaching behind your TV to the jungle of tangled cables ever again.</p>



<p>The Anker HDMI switch has a wide range of compatibility. Set it up with a laptop, PC, Xbox, Nintendo Switch, PlayStation, or even a streaming stick like a Fire TV or Roku. And then the other end can hook up to your TV, a monitor, a projector, or even an HDMI compatible VR headset.</p>
<p>It supports resolutions of up to 4K and refresh rates of up to 60Hz, so choose wisely which consoles you choose to go through this instead of your TV’s native HDMI inputs. You won’t be able to make use of the PlayStation 5 Pro’s high-frame rates of 120fps. Also, the switch does not support HDMI CEC. This is the tech that will turn your TV on the same time you turn on your Nintendo Switch or something like that.</p>
