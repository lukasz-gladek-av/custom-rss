Instead, they can be revived by other players. One way to do this is to play as a medic, run over to the wounded soldier with some defibrillator paddles, and give them a quick charge. This will instantly bring them back to life. And that’s fine, I guess. But the more enjoyable and exciting way to bring people back is to grab them by their bulletproof vest and drag them to safety. </p><p>On PC, the platform we played on, you simply walk over to the downed player and hold E. Doing so grabs them and slowly fills up a meter that, once filled, signals the player’s revived. While you are holding them, you can move backwards and drag them away from where they fell. You don’t have to do this, but it’s often a smart move, as they were likely in a dangerous spot when they were downed. For example, during one match, my squad was taken down by snipers. I made my way to the closest downed player and dragged them into a nearby building. A moment later, they were up on their feet, and I felt like a big hero from a war movie. </p><figure id="" data-id="0380fe66f678e31f6c329c9f5628dc9c" data-recommend-id="image://0380fe66f678e31f6c329c9f5628dc9c" data-format="png" data-width="1915" data-height="1059" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="First-person gameplay screenshot of a player on a war-torn city street dragging a downed teammate to safety." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="First-person gameplay screenshot of a player on a war-torn city street dragging a downed teammate to safety." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="false" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>A player drags a downed squadmate to safety in footage released by EA.</figcaption><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->EA</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="0380fe66f678e31f6c329c9f5628dc9c" data-recommend-id="image://0380fe66f678e31f6c329c9f5628dc9c" data-format="png" data-width="1915" data-height="1059" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="First-person gameplay screenshot of a player on a war-torn city street dragging a downed teammate to safety." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>I ended up dragging a lot of comrades around <em>Battlefield 6</em>, saving them from danger, bringing them back into the battle, and having a great time in the process. Afterward, when I talked to others who had played during the event, they often would bring up the dragging mechanic and rave about it. Even folks who weren’t as enthused with <em>BF6 </em>as I was were still big fans of heroically grabbing and pulling people to safety.</p><p>Part of what makes this feature so awesome is how easy it is. It’s one button. It’s something anyone can do, but it feels <em>so </em>cool. And it also helps out a teammate, which makes you feel even better. Getting dragged is also nice. You feel so special. </p><p>“Wow, this person really cares about me!” I would think to myself each time a random player dragged me behind some wall and out of gunfire. In reality, they just wanted to feel cool and get some extra XP. But, whatever, everyone is happy in the end. Now that’s a great way to make people work together in an online game. Take note, other shooters: This is an idea worth copying. <br></p><p>I can’t wait to drag more of my buddies and squadmates when <em>Battlefield 6</em> launches on console and PC on October 10. </p><p> .<br></p></div></div><br/><br/>https://kotaku.com/battlefield-6-bf6-dragging-people-multiplayer-reveal-ea-1851787385]]></content:encoded>

But then I sat down and got to play over four hours of EA’s upcoming military FPS, and somehow, by the end, I was so won over by this new game that I almost forgot about Limp Bizkit.

This is a game that has four different studios (previously five) working on it. A game that EA is seemingly betting the farm on. A game that is meant to return the franchise to greatness after it stumbled in past entries, like <em>BF 2042. </em></p><p>And EA and Battlefield Studios’ plan to pull all this off with <em>Battlefield 6,</em> launching this October, is simple, but smart: <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/battlefield-6-bf6-reveal-trailer-teaser-sp-ea-gameplay-1851786894&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/battlefield-6-bf6-reveal-trailer-teaser-sp-ea-gameplay-1851786894">Make <em>Battlefield 4</em> again</a></span>, but with better visuals, improved gunplay, and a few ideas to freshen it up. That’s the fan favorite entry. The one people compare every other installment against. It might seem cynical to frame <em>BF6 </em>as “<em>BF4 Again</em>” but it’s practically what EA said during the on-stage event before I played the game. “A spiritual successor to <em>Battlefield 3 </em>and <em>Battlefield 4</em>" were exact words used by one developer. And as a fan of those games, I’m happy to report they (mostly) nailed it. </p><p>I and a whole army of other journalists, critics, and content creators got to play a handful of maps and modes in L.A. as part of a preview event ahead of the game’s full multiplayer reveal that happened on Thursday. (Travel and accommodation were provided to <em>Kotaku&nbsp;</em>by the publisher.) This wasn’t a finished build, but what I played felt good enough to ship. </p><p>Set in 2027, <em>BF6 </em>returns the franchise to a contemporary military setting. There are no crazy laser guns or robots. Instead, it’s M4s, Abrams tanks, shotguns, dusty streets, and frag grenades. This is a more grounded and gritty military shooter compared to recent <em>Call of Duty</em> entries.</p><h2 id="h824040"><a id=""></a>Dangerous guns and different classes</h2><p>Combat is loud and dangerous. The time to kill is fairly short, and headshots are extremely lethal. Every gun I used packed a punch and felt destructive. <em>Battlefield 6</em>, more than anything else, nails its gunplay and combat. Firefights are chaotic, but moving around the very dense but easy-to-navigate maps is a breeze thanks to improved controls.  You can jump out windows, slide, roll when landing, sprint while crouched, and even shoot guns while lying on your back. Even when I was getting my ass kicked by some popular streamer, I still had a good time when playing the franchise’s famous Conquest mode because moving and shooting in <em>BF6 </em>is a joy. But like in <em>BF4 </em>and <em>BF3</em>, you move slowly and deliberately in <em>BF6</em>. Characters feel heavy, as do vehicles, making combat feel less like a twitchy arena shooter and more like a digital simulation of a real war. </p><p>Adding to that feeling of chaotic, gritty combat is the ability for any player to grab a downed player and drag them to safety before reviving them. I did this many times in my time with the game, often pulling fellow squad members out of harm’s way or out of the scope of a pesky sniper. It’s a small, simple, but surprisingly engaging mechanic that everybody I spoke to after the event loved. I expect some other games might steal it from <em>BF6 </em>in the future. </p><figure id="" data-id="5e44a3f016c7f34548f53bde816bd679" data-recommend-id="image://5e44a3f016c7f34548f53bde816bd679" data-format="png" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->EA / Battlefield Studios</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="5e44a3f016c7f34548f53bde816bd679" data-recommend-id="image://5e44a3f016c7f34548f53bde816bd679" data-format="png" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Classes return to <em>Battlefield </em>after being absent from <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/battlefield-2042-the-kotaku-review-1848123654&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/battlefield-2042-the-kotaku-review-1848123654"><em>2042</em></a></span><em> </em>at launch (and then later shoved back in via a post-launch update), and they work like they did in <em>BF3/BF4</em>. You can play as Assault, Support, Engineer, and Recon. Each class has a few key abilities and traits that help make them feel different during combat. </p><p>For example, the Assault trooper takes less fall damage and readies assault rifles quicker than anyone else, helping give them the edge in one one-on-one fights. Meanwhile, the Support trooper—my favorite—can place down chest-high bulletproof walls to provide cover, and can also provide ammo refills to teammates. They can also instantly revive players, which is faster than dragging them out of combat, but not as fun. </p><p>Having the traditional classes return in <em>Battlefield 6 </em>is both a nostalgic return to what I loved before and also a great reminder that, yeah, this is the best way to do a class-based shooter. However, one big change here from <em>BF4 </em>and <em>BF3 </em>is that classes can now spawn with any weapon. While there are some advantages for picking the specific weapon type suited to each class—like snipers getting to reload scoped rifles without leaving aim-down-sight—this new open weapon system does rob the classes of some individuality.</p><p>This is extremely noticeable in the smaller, more combat-focused modes that take place on specific sections of the larger maps. Here, a sniper becomes less useful, but the Recon troopers’ motion sensor is still nifty. So many players I fought during the event just swapped out a scoped rifle for an SMG. It ended up feeling less like <em>Battlefield 3</em> and more like a <em>Call of Duty </em>clone. Thankfully, EA says <em>BF6 </em>will ship with playlists that feature locked class weapons, which is nice, but I worry how that will split the game’s fanbase in the weeks and months after launch. </p><h2 id="h824041"><a id=""></a>Lots of destruction, but smaller maps</h2><p>On the plus side: <em>BF3 </em>tank lovers, rejoice. Your armored mechanical beasts are very powerful in <em>Battlefield 6.</em> When an enemy tank would appear, I’d panic and dive for cover or try to get as many walls between me and it as possible. And thanks to <em>BF6 </em>bringing back <em>Battlefield’s </em>beloved destruction, tanks and other vehicles can quickly turn the tide of battle by ripping holes in walls or even demolishing sections of buildings. One of the funniest moments involving destruction that I experienced involved someone using a tank to knock out the wall and floor of a building I was camping in, sending me falling below into debris and enemy gunfire.</p><figure id="" data-id="7e5ac75492678221c0f05f90c1a22a67" data-recommend-id="image://7e5ac75492678221c0f05f90c1a22a67" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->EA / Battlefield Studios</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="7e5ac75492678221c0f05f90c1a22a67" data-recommend-id="image://7e5ac75492678221c0f05f90c1a22a67" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>This is what EA is calling “Tactical Destruction,” which is the idea that levels should be extremely breakable and that destruction should not only look cool (which it does) but that it should serve a purpose. A single grenade or rocket can alter a shortcut or change up a hiding spot. I’ll need to see how other maps feel, but so far, what I’ve played has me excited to see how EA and Battlefield Studios design maps to be destructible in tactical ways.</p><p>Speaking of maps, all of the ones in <em>BF6</em>'s preview were smaller than what was found in <em>BF 2042</em>. This is a good thing. It means you spend less time looking for action and more time fighting other players in chaotic shootouts. The maps also look gorgeous, with lots of lovely details, most of which get destroyed by the end. I also felt like they all funneled players into firefights efficiently and didn’t feel too barren or busy.</p><p>The devs at the event said they went back and got inspired by some of the classic maps fans love, and I can feel it. And all but one of the nine maps launching with <em>BF6 </em>are new. (The one exception is the return of Operation Firestorm.) This strikes me as the <em>BF6 </em>devs feeling confident in what they have made, and they should feel that way. These are some damn fine <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/battlefield-2042-bf2042-season-7-last-ea-motive-future-1851397390?_gl=1*au54e4*_ga*MjA2NzM0ODM3MS4xNzQ5ODUxOTU4*_ga_V4QNJTT5L0*czE3NTM5Mzg3MzEkbzE1JGcxJHQxNzUzOTQwNzgwJGoxMyRsMCRoMA..&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/battlefield-2042-bf2042-season-7-last-ea-motive-future-1851397390?_gl=1*au54e4*_ga*MjA2NzM0ODM3MS4xNzQ5ODUxOTU4*_ga_V4QNJTT5L0*czE3NTM5Mzg3MzEkbzE1JGcxJHQxNzUzOTQwNzgwJGoxMyRsMCRoMA.."><em>Battlefield</em></a></span><em>&nbsp;</em>maps. </p><p>I was sad when my four hours with <em>Battlefield 6 </em>were over. As someone who played way, way too much <em>Battlefield 3</em> and<em> Battlefield 4</em>, <em>BF6 </em>is exactly what I wanted. It’s a return to the slower, grittier, louder, and smaller digital battles I (and other fans) prefer. It’s not a confusing and overly large mess, like <em>BF 2042</em>. Instead, <em>BF6 </em>feels like a refined, improved, and perfected version of a game people already loved. It might not be the most original or fresh spin on <em>Battlefield</em>, and that might limit how many new players it brings in. But what’s here is <em>really </em>good, and I can’t wait to play more when <em>Battlefield 6</em> arrives on October 10. Hopefully, I won’t have to listen to Limp Bizkit before I play again. </p><p> .<br></p></div></div><br/><br/>https://kotaku.com/battlefield-6-preview-destruction-classes-bf3-bf4-1851787384]]></content:encoded>

But that brings up one question: Is the gacha system through which you recruited its dozens of characters still intact? Turns out, no, and that’s part of the game’s major story overhauls.</p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="196055" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="6 Things To Know Before Starting Persona 5 Tactica" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="227" data-playlist="196055,196572,196411" data-current="196055"><div><p>6 Things To Know Before Starting Persona 5 Tactica</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196055/196055_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196055/196055_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196055/196055_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196055/196055_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/21584.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>In a statement to <em>Kotaku</em>, a Square Enix representative confirmed <em>Octopath Traveler 0 </em>is reworking <em>Champions of the Continent </em>to let you recruit new party members throughout the story, rather than through a gacha system.</p><p>“<em>Octopath Traveler 0</em> restructures the story of <em>Octopath Traveler: Champions of the Continent</em> with new interpretations, but it is a new core entry in the series without gacha or other common mobile game mechanics,” the statement reads. “The game mechanics work for players to encounter allies in various ways throughout the story and the journey.”</p><p>So it sounds like while <em>0 </em>will adapt parts of <em>Champions of the Continent</em>’s story, it is being retooled to strip out some of the more frustrating free-to-play trappings. Square has already said the game will have “more than 30” characters to recruit, which is the most in the <em>Octopath Traveler </em>series. It remains to be seen just how much the original story will be tweaked to accommodate all of them, but at least you won’t have to cross your fingers and hope you unlock your favorites in a gacha pull.</p><p><em>Octopath Traveler 0 </em>is coming to PC, PS4, PS5, Switch, Switch 2, and Xbox Series X/S on December 4.</p></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://kotaku.com/octopath-traveler-0-gacha-champions-continent-remake-1851787459]]></content:encoded>
