Why such a big deal? Because not only will this be the very first time the game has been made available on <em>any</em> platform since its original release, but it’s <em>the </em>version of <em>Tetris</em> when it comes to the thriving eSports scene.</p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="194644" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="The Week In Games: Return To Hyrule" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="165" data-playlist="194644,194328,196626" data-current="194644"><div><p>The Week In Games: Return To Hyrule</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/194644/194644_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/194644/194644_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/194644/194644_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/194644/194644_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/20101.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>The history of <em>Tetris</em> is such an extraordinary tale, so much so that <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tetris_(film)&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tetris_(film)" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">2023 saw the release of a hit movie based on the events</a></span>. Its earliest years are a tangled confusion of rights and ownership disputes, culminating in its breakthrough Nintendo versions released for the NES and Game Boy in 1989. (The NES release itself is an astonishing tale, with Atari and Nintendo making rival versions, that somehow saw the <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://moneyweek.com/505757/great-frauds-in-history-robert-maxwell&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://moneyweek.com/505757/great-frauds-in-history-robert-maxwell" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">vile, pension-stealing human stain, Robert Maxwell</a></span>, trying to convince Mikhail Gorbachev to cancel Nintendo’s contract!)</p><p>Anyhow, that NES version has since never been re-released or made available on any of Nintendo’s subsequent e-stores. Come December 12, that’s going to change, as the game is added to the teetering pile of emulated classics in the Switch Online subscription service.</p><p>The NES version has become enormously popular thanks to its recent prominence in eSports, especially following 2023's extraordinary series of broken world records, as players saw scores previously thought impossible, and the game’s killscreen was reached for the very first time. All of this is exquisitely documented in a YouTube documentary by Summoning Salt, which <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/the-wild-story-of-tetris-world-records-has-to-be-seen-t-1851484690?_gl=1*8zaqwt*_ga*MTk5MTE1MDYyMi4xNzIyNjAzODYw*_ga_V4QNJTT5L0*MTczMzI0MDM4MS40MDkuMS4xNzMzMjQwMzk1LjQ2LjAuMA..&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/the-wild-story-of-tetris-world-records-has-to-be-seen-t-1851484690?_gl=1*8zaqwt*_ga*MTk5MTE1MDYyMi4xNzIyNjAzODYw*_ga_V4QNJTT5L0*MTczMzI0MDM4MS40MDkuMS4xNzMzMjQwMzk1LjQ2LjAuMA..">Carolyn Petit wrote about last year</a></span>.</p><p>I swear, I’ve only ever been the most casual <em>Tetris</em> player (although, weirdly, I did once get to have a coffee with Alexey Pajitnov and Henk Rogers), and I found this two-hour doc utterly compelling from start to finish. There are <em>so </em>many twists and turns.</p><p>It’ll be fascinating to see how the Switch Online version fares. Presumably, the scene will judge it very closely, given how competitive players have more recently insisted on playing on an original NES cart for the best results. Or they’ll ignore it entirely because everything they’ve built is based on playing with the original NES controller and the nuances of drumming on its rear. Or, you know, regular people might just enjoy a nice game of one of the best versions of <em>Tetris</em>.</p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

We’ll get to <em>Forza Horizon 4</em>, but also leaving Game Pass is <em>Rise of the Tomb Raider</em>, the middle-installment of the <em>Survivor</em> trilogy, Supermassive’s interactive horror <em>The Quarry</em>, adorable all-ages puzzle-platformer <em>Rainbow Billy</em>, puzzle adventure <em>Tin Hearts</em>, the lovely (<span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2021/04/forager_team_retaliates_after_lead_dev_blames_them_for_cancelled_multiplayer&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2021/04/forager_team_retaliates_after_lead_dev_blames_them_for_cancelled_multiplayer" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">although the development wasn’t</a></span>) crafting game <em>Forager</em>, and hit first-person horror <em>Amnesia: The Bunker</em>.</p><p>Oof, that’s a lot of strong titles to be going at once. And I’m personally annoyed about <em>The Bunker</em>, as I’d just spent far too long rearranging my storage space on my Series S to be able to install it, as it’s the only <em>Amnesia</em> game I’ve not gotten around to playing.</p><p>The story with <em>Forza</em> is a whole lot worse, although it’s nothing to do with Game Pass. On December 15, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/forza-horizon-4-delisted-xbox-licensing-1851561111&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/forza-horizon-4-delisted-xbox-licensing-1851561111">as we first learned about in June</a></span>, <em>Forza Horizon 4</em> is being delisted from all online gaming stores entirely—and it’s all because of licensing.</p><p>2018's <em>Horizon 4</em> immediately became one of the most beloved games...pretty much ever. Set in the English Cotswolds (although, as someone who technically lives in the Cotswolds, I’d venture a somewhat idyllic interpretation), it sits on an astonishing Metascore of 92, with a dedicated fanbase still playing as the final season, series 77, draws to a close.</p><p>The Microsoft-owned game has never expanded on what these “licensing issues” are, but you would imagine that during its development, the rights to use the vast numbers of real-world cards would have been agreed to on a limited contract. And given the timing, it’d be reasonable to guess it had been set for six years. I mean, six years, right?! That’s <em>forever</em>! They’d have known they were aiming for a 2021 release for <em>Forza Horizon 5</em>, meaning they’d have an extra three years covered even after it had been usurped...</p><p>The good news is if you <em>own</em> the game (<span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/california-ab-2426-digital-games-the-crew-new-law-psn-1851659641&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/california-ab-2426-digital-games-the-crew-new-law-psn-1851659641">you don’t actually <em>own</em> the game</a></span>), you will be able to continue playing it, both offline and online (although the latter is likely to go eventually). All the game’s DLC was already lost in the summer, but if you bought any to use with your Game Pass subscription version of the main game, you’ll have received tokens that’ll unlock the same in a paid version. They expire in June 2026, but you know, use them now or you’ll certainly forget. You know what you’re like.</p><p>So yes, this is the last chance to <em>ever</em> buy <em>Forza Horizon 4</em>, and it’s <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.xbox.com/en-us/games/store/forza-horizon-4-standard-edition/9PNJXVCVWD4K&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.xbox.com/en-us/games/store/forza-horizon-4-standard-edition/9PNJXVCVWD4K" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">appropriately discounted on the Xbox store right now</a></span> to $12.</p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
