            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Earlier this week, Ubisoft revealed three <a href="https://kotaku.com/assassins-creed-black-flag-vets-leading-frnachise-series-vantage-new-games-2000672792">new leaders for <em>Assassin’s Creed</em></a>. One of those will now be taking over as creative director for <em>Assassin’s Creed Hexe</em> as its existing lead, Clint Hocking, departs the company after a cumulative 20 years working on Ubisoft games.</p> <p>As first <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/assassins-creed-hexe-director-clint-hocking-has-left-ubisoft-as-part-of-franchise-upheaval/">reported by<em> VGC</em></a>, staff were informed about Hocking’s departure during an internal meeting with the new Assassin’s Creed leadership team just this week. “We sincerely thank [Clint] for his vision, creative contributions, and dedication over the years, and we wish him the very best in his next chapter,” a spokesperson for Ubisoft said. “Development on Assassin’s Creed Codename Hexe continues with a seasoned team.”</p>

 <p>Hocking first joined the French publisher in 2001 to lead projects like <em>Splinter Cell: Chaos Theory</em> and <em>Far Cry 2</em>. He eventually left for <a href="https://kotaku.com/how-lucasarts-fell-apart-1401731043">brief stints at LucasArts, Valve, and Amazon Games</a> before returning in 2015 and later directing <em>Watch Dogs Legion</em>. Like <em>Far Cry 2</em>, it was an ambitious, systems-driven sandbox where players swapped between procedurally generated characters on the streets of London to fight a fascist surveillance state. It was mechanically innovative but sales disappointed.</p> <p>Hocking has been on Hexe, the next blockbuster <em>Assassin’s Creed</em> game coming in the pipeline with <a href="https://kotaku.com/far-cry-7-extraction-shooter-assassins-creed-hexe-ubisoft-2000672574">a reported release date goal of 2027</a>. “After over a year of working in the darkness, happy to announce I’m working as the Creative Director on Assassin’s Creed: Codename Hexe, with an amazing team in Montreal,” he posted back in 2022.</p>

 <p><em>Hexe</em> takes place in the “latter stages of the Holy Roman Empire,” involves witch trials, and would seemingly take on a much more survival horror-infused tone than other games in the series. We’ll see if that’s still the case now that, as <em>VGC</em> reports, Assassin’s Creed veteran Jean Guesdon, a director on <em>Black Flag</em> and <em>Origins</em>, is taking over.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/marvel-rivals-griefers-throwers-bounties-intlist-2000673645</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><span>Intlist, a website that allows users to post bounties “on griefers &amp; throwers” in </span><i><span>Marvel Rivals</span></i><span>, </span><i><span>Overwatch</span></i><span>, and </span><i><span>Valorant</span></i><span>, went live on February 23, and the </span><i><span>Marvel Rivals</span></i><span> community is particularly ticked off about it, mostly because they believe that NetEase is to blame for letting things get to this point in the first place. Intlist promises that those who respond to the bounties on the website will be paid for their work, but it’s clearly trying to have its cake and eat it too, as its founders state that the posted bounties are ”not a green light to harass the target.” In spite of this statement, several bounties on Intlist feature information about the targets in question that can be used to track them down elsewhere, such as their Twitch usernames.</span></p> <p><span>Founded in part by a “former pro player” called EchoRivals, Intlist’s official page on </span><a href="https://x.com/IntlistOrg/status/2025963500653203478"><span>X</span></a><span> states that the site’s creation is also NetEase’s fault, due to their implementation of Engagement-Oriented Matchmaking in </span><i><span>Marvel Rivals </span></i><span>(via </span><a href="https://fandomwire.com/marvel-rivals-fans-demand-shutdown-of-a-website-letting-players-post-bounties-on-throwers-and-griefers/"><i><span>Fandomwire</span></i></a><span>). “intlist.org exists because the devs left a gap — and the community filled it. Remove EOMM and actually ban throwers? We’ll gladly shut down.” For context, NetEase </span><a href="https://x.com/MarvelRivals/status/1955117077561593877?lang=en"><span>has stated</span></a><span> on multiple occasions that </span><i><span>Marvel Rivals</span></i><span> doesn’t use EOMM.</span></p>

 <figure id="attachment_2000673662" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000673662"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000673662">©</figcaption></figure> <p><span>However,</span><i><span> Marvel Rivals</span></i><span> players are upset with NetEase due to the lax methods it uses to punish people who throw games and grief teammates. Prior to Inlist’s creation, posts criticizing NetEase for not banning those who abuse this fact seemed to pop up on r/rivals on a </span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/rivals/comments/1r03rip/throwers_are_killing_the_game/"><span>daily basis</span></a><span>. “Can we just start banning people for throwing. I don’t get how we’re a year into this game and people are still throwing games left and right 24/7 without anything happening to them.”</span></p> <p><span>That being said, the same subreddit isn’t too fond of Intlist either, as the community is now asking NetEase to go </span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/marvelrivals/comments/1rdm7f8/are_we_for_real_there_is_bounties_for_throwing/"><span>after the website</span></a><span> directly. According to several players in the thread, Intlist is clearly only making the problem worse. “There is also a Saudi millionaire paying people to target throwers, and now every game is people throwing each other’s games. Can we do something about this, please? Perma these people.”</span></p>

 <p><span>Perhaps the most obvious sign that Intlist isn’t doing its due diligence here are the specific names featured in the bounties. One of the targets posted on the site is pro player Jay3, founder of the Jay3 Community Clash tournament, who has a 7-dollar bounty on his digital head. It also doesn’t help the founders’ case that the </span><a href="https://x.com/IntlistOrg/status/2026535423938265521"><span>latest post</span></a><span> on Intlist’s X page states that the website is currently down for maintenance so they can “cook a few things.” That is slightly underselling the reason behind its “maintenance,” as earlier this morning, founder EchoRivals announced on the official Intlist Discord server that the site is offline because they “detected unauthorized access.“ As a result, a “limited number of email addresses tied to bounty posts were exposed.”</span></p>

              <p>For nearly 20 years, I have been constantly astonished by what people are capable of creating in&nbsp;<em>Minecraft</em>. Thanks to Creative mode, people have been able to build the most astonishing buildings, then towns, then cities, then countries. Maps like <a href="https://www.planetminecraft.com/project/city-of-newisle-v-07032015-solo-modern-build/">Newisle</a>, <a href="https://www.westeroscraft.com/">Westeroscraft</a> and, well, <a href="https://www.patreon.com/PippenFTS">the entire planet Earth</a> are breathtaking pieces of work, years in the making, but it turns out they’re being created in easy mode. At least, in comparison to YouTuber stan616, who took it upon himself to spend nearly 80 days building a spectacular recreation of <em>One Piece</em>‘s Marineford in Hardcore, using over a million blocks.</p> <p>To explain: Usually, when people take on enormous builds like this in&nbsp;<em>Minecraft</em>, they play in the game’s Creative mode, which allows you to generate any number of any block type at will. Also, it lets you fly. This means that while still huge feats, people at least have the resources and dexterity to just crack on with constructing their masterpiece. But stan616 has opted for something far sillier. In Hardcore, every cube of every part of every building, ship, pathway and mountain has to be mined, harvested and crafted from scratch. Oh, and every tool used to do this, too. And if he wants to fly, that’s going to require vast numbers of eyltra and fireworks, and you can’t build while you’re doing that. Sound ridiculous enough? Because that’s the easy bit. That’d be how you’d do it in Survival mode. But in Hardcore, the world is also filled with aggressive mods spawning in and attacking, and should he die, the <em>whole build is lost</em>.</p>

 <p>Heck, if he fell from a wall he was building and missed a bucket clutch, he’d be in big trouble. Yes, he did the whole build with a Totem of Undying in one hand, meaning death can be averted, but once that Totem’s gone he’s got to swap another one in damn fast or he could be done for. Anyone who’s fallen in <em>Minecraft</em> will know how horribly possible it is to pop your Totem, then fall again before you know what’s happening. (Never. Dig. Straight. Down.)</p> <p>There are moments in the 90-minute edit of the 77 days this project took where he comes horrifically close to death. Like the time a Creeper sneaks up behind him as he’s building and blows itself up, popping his Totem and leaving him shaking in his chair. Or, far more stupidly, when he flew full-pace into a wall, narrowly missing the window, and nearly brained himself. Why do this? Why make it this hard? Because you gotta stand out.</p>

 <p>The video is great fun. Despite the embarrassingly pompous opening narration, the rest of the hour is nothing like that, with stan616 including moments of humiliation (like when he realizes he spent a day working on the wrong template), humility, and good-natured humor.</p>

  <p>You’ll note that when building in Hardcore, he’s working from schematics. This is a technique where elaborate crafts are designed in Creative, then the designs are exported with a mod like <a href="https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/litematica">Litematica</a> into the Hardcore world. These then appear like ghosts in the world, and builders fill them in with the appropriate blocks. It makes builds of this scale plausible, but as you’ll see from the video, doesn’t guarantee success.</p> <p>The logistics here are phenomenal. The designing, the blueprinting, the mining, the networks of chests, the oxidizing all the copper, the smelting, the searching the map for Trial Chambers and amethysts and everything else, all before the build even begins, all of this while risking death at any moment. If you want to avoid all that for yourself, stan616 <a href="https://www.patreon.com/cw/stan616">is selling the build on his Patreon</a> for $55.50.</p>

 <p>Just the thought of gathering the blocks required makes me want to go back to bed. In total, he used 1,187,773 blocks. But doing it in Hardcore? Dude. No. Just imagine. Absolutely incredible work.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><span>Overall, </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/overwatch-2-spotlight-new-heroes-perks-stadium-returning-2000665736"><i><span>Overwatch </span></i><span>is in a good place right now</span></a><span>. The five new heroes Blizzard released for the shooter are dynamic, the </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/overwatch-cinematic-doomfist-vendetta-death-reign-talon-2000665013"><span>focus on story</span></a><span> has given us new lore on a weekly basis, and the roadmap for future seasons sounds promising. But like any service game, there’s always going to be something that’s getting on the community’s nerves, and players who use characters whose primary function is to heal are fighting for their lives thanks to one subtle but significant change.</span></p> <p><span>If you play a character like Mercy or Lifeweaver whose primary utility is in straightforward healing, you might’ve noticed that it’s a bit harder to keep your teammates alive than it used to be. That’s because there’s a </span><a href="https://overwatch.blizzard.com/en-us/news/patch-notes/"><span>new universal passive across all heroes</span></a><span> that reduces incoming healing on players who have been damaged in the past three seconds. Previously exclusive to damage characters, this reduction lowers healing by 30 percent for most heroes, and 15 percent for tanks since they’re sturdier and have bigger health bars to fill.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><span>Where once you’d have to be chased down by a damage hero and pestered with bullets to feel the effects of this healing reduction, now every opposing hero can limit your support’s healing output for long enough that some characters like Mercy can’t outheal incoming damage like they once did. Heroes like Winston and Moira, who are able to apply constant damage through their beam-like primary fires, can now overpower Mercy’s healing with little effort, even when she’s using her ultimate ability. Because she’s a single-target healer, her entire utility has been cut off at the knees.</span></p> <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">People intentionally misunderstanding bc it's a static example. The point is about how ineffective her healing is now as a single target healer. Mercy takes an eternity to even TRY to sustain her target with little room to DMG boost </p> <p>Here's a 6s example in game in Valkyrie <a href="https://t.co/wAYRX6A3XM">https://t.co/wAYRX6A3XM</a> <a href="https://t.co/7Q9uY2nVzD">pic.twitter.com/7Q9uY2nVzD</a></p> <p>— Skiesti 🌻 (@skiesti_) <a href="https://twitter.com/skiesti_/status/2024134672096084454?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">February 18, 2026</a></p></blockquote>  <p><span>Though Mercy is the most impacted by this change, you can see some pretty damning examples of it for characters like Moira as well, who is having trouble healing teammates who have been focused.&nbsp;</span></p>

   <p><span>Though supports are struggling right now, some </span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Competitiveoverwatch/comments/1r90voc/how_do_we_feel_about_the_healing_reduction/"><span>fans argue that this incentivizes players to actually get behind cover</span></a><span> and not run into the line of fire with reckless abandon. Which is fair enough, and I would love to not have to Life Grip every tank who thinks they can 1v5 an enemy team through sheer willpower, but if Blizzard is going to keep this universal passive across its heroes, characters like Mercy and Lifeweaver will probably need some kind of rework or buff to keep up. Blizzard has already said </span><a href="https://x.com/OWCavalry/status/2024984783084793974"><span>both heroes will be getting some of their old Perks integrated into their kits</span></a><span>; we’ll see if it’s enough to make them viable in </span><i><span>Overwatch</span></i><span>’s healing suppression era.</span></p>
