It didn’t just increase the skill count needed for the ability from five to six, it also starts Yajirobe off in each match with zero beans instead of 2. Also he lost half a health bar. Rip bud. <br></p><p>Today’s patch was also accompanied by a preview of what the development team is working on next, and it includes some particularly nefarious issues around character resets and deleted data. “Also, we are aware of some remaining issues and are investigating: character rank reset to 0, connection errors &amp; online matching issues, [and] corrupted save data,” the <em>Dragon Ball</em> account <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://x.com/dragonballgames/status/1849377423542079847&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://x.com/dragonballgames/status/1849377423542079847" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">tweeted</a></span>. “We apologize to all affected players and thank you for your patience.”</p><p>The corrupted save data issue is a weird one that we still don’t have any real clarity on in terms of what causes it or why, but the subreddit and Discord are littered with unfortunate souls who have seen <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/SparkingZero/comments/1g47nkx/all_data_reset/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/SparkingZero/comments/1g47nkx/all_data_reset/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">dozens of hours of playtime on PS5 and Xbox Series X/S erased</a></span>, and sometimes even completionist playthroughs of the arena fighter wiped.

The only real safeguard against it is using manual cloud saves.

But at least no one else will have to suffer a similar fate. </p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

It seemed clear from the show’s start that Aubrey Plaza’s Rio Valda wasn’t exactly who she said she was. Fans had a <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/marvel-agatha-all-along-mcu-theories-wiccan-mephisto-1851656313&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/marvel-agatha-all-along-mcu-theories-wiccan-mephisto-1851656313">wide array of theories</a></span>, but they don’t have to guess any longer. As some may have suspected thanks to the show’s many hints, Rio Valda is none other than Death herself. This was most obviously hinted at in episode five when a ouija board the coven uses says that Death is in the room with them, which we now know meant Rio Valda. The revelation has an ominous note to it, as Death tells Patti LuPone’s Lilia that all roads lead to her. This is clearly implying that the coven’s journey on the Witches’ Road will lead to their deaths.</p><p>This, tragically, seems to be true, as by the end of episode seven Lilia meets her demise. Before the episode’s flashy finale, however, Patti LuPone steals the show and delivers the performance we’ve all been waiting for. The casting of LuPone was exciting for Broadway fans, as the actress is a legend of the stage known for her killer presence and voice. Given her star power, it came as a shock that LuPone takes the backseat in <em>Agatha All Along</em> for the first six episodes. Sure, she has some good quips in there, but it often felt like the show was scared to let her go all-out and risk her overshadowing the lead performances of Kathryn Hahn and Joe Locke. But in episode seven, LuPone gets to let loose.</p><p>With Agatha and Billy coming to a tentative truce after the revelations of <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/agatha-all-along-episode-6-twist-spoilers-recap-1851676452&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/agatha-all-along-episode-6-twist-spoilers-recap-1851676452">the last two episodes</a></span>, the coven find themselves in yet another trial of the Witches’ Road. This one traps them in a room with a tarot deck and a ceiling full of swords slowly pressing down toward them. The only way forward is to place the correct cards on the table, a job which falls to fortune teller Lilia. The episode then dives into how Lilia sees events take place which, due to her ability to see the past and future, occurs out of order for her. That means we get a lot of cutting back and forth between time periods as the show depicts Lilia’s disorienting life, a life that, it seems, has always been leading to this moment. Throughout it all, LuPone infuses every scene she’s in with a palpable emotion that blows her co-stars out of the water, and it all builds up to her sacrificing herself to save Agatha, Billy, and Jen. It’s a climactic conclusion to Lilia’s arc, anchored by a performance only Patti LuPone could give.</p><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://disneyplus.bn5x.net/c/379647/564546/9358?subId1=KT-&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.disneyplus.com%2Fseries%2Fagatha-all-along%2F6Nf0RIVHbJnh&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://disneyplus.bn5x.net/c/379647/564546/9358?subId1=KT-&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.disneyplus.com%2Fseries%2Fagatha-all-along%2F6Nf0RIVHbJnh" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>Agatha All Along</em> is streaming now on Disney+.</a></span> </p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Peely, a nightmare we are cursed to endure, deserves all of this and more. Go to hell Peely, it’s where you came from in the first place. </p><p> .<br></p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
