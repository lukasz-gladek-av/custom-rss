Her straight-forward kit has a lot of interesting quirks that enable them to mesh well together and excel in specific-use cases. Understanding how to make the most of her tools is key to keeping yourself and the rest of your team in the fight.</p><h2 id="h281"><a id=""></a>Healing is your priority, but don’t forget to dish out some damage too</h2><p>Luna Snow’s ease of use and fantastic healing are the primary reasons why she’s considered a top Strategist. While everyone loves a healer who can keep the team in top shape, that doesn’t mean Luna is a one-trick pony. Her low damage is offset by burst-fire hitscan shots that can potentially shred an opponent with a small health pool. I’m not advising that you play her like a DPS (damage-per-second) hero, but there is nothing wrong with dealing damage alongside your team when you have the ability to. Aside from potentially eliminating an enemy, it’s an ideal way to charge up your Ultimate.</p><h2 id="h282"><a id=""></a>Prioritize Idol Aura for flankers or emergency Burst Healing</h2><p>One of Luna’s most interesting abilities is Share The Stage. This marks an ally with Idol Aura, which grants them a portion of the healing that Luna is providing to others. My suggestion is to put this on any teammate who’ll be flanking the enemy since you won’t have line-of-sight. Spider-Man, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/marvel-rivals-venom-tank-how-to-play-mvp-svp-1851736774&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/marvel-rivals-venom-tank-how-to-play-mvp-svp-1851736774">Venom</a></span>, and Psylocke should all be top of mind to give Idol Aura too. Don’t be embarrassed about needing to give it to an Iron Man either, depending on how erratic they’re flying around.</p><p>The other aspect that makes this ability amazing is that Luna will generate 35-percent bonus healing if her target is an ally she marked with Idol Aura. If one of your Vanguards is close to death, throw Idol Aura on them and then heal like normal. That bonus will make a major difference and have them in a safer range of health before you know it. Just remember to switch back to a flanker afterward! </p><h2 id="h283"><a id=""></a>Absolute Zero can halt momentum and even some Ultimates</h2><p>It wouldn’t feel right for an ice-based character to not have a freezing crowd-control ability. Fulfilling that role is Absolute Zero, which emits a large projectile that will freeze an enemy for 2.7 seconds. The effect will cancel out if the target is attacked after the initial 0.5 seconds of being frozen. While this likely exists as a buffer to allow them to be frozen for even a short amount of time, Luna’s primary attack is a three-round burst-fire that comes out in 0.5 seconds. Letting loose with a few shots after throwing out the Absolute Zero projectile is a smart way to maximize damage.</p><p>You’ll ideally want to use this against any flankers attacking you or to keep any annoyingly nimble characters still so you can score some headshots. Targeting an Ulting enemy is an excellent use for the ability, as it can interrupt or, in some cases, completely cancel an ultimate. Feel free to use this even more liberally if you’re the sole healer on the team, since it is one of two abilities that provides self-healing at a rate of 30 HP/s for three seconds. It’s certainly better than nothing.</p><h2 id="h284"><a id=""></a>Focus on healing with Ice Arts</h2><p>Two obvious drawbacks for Luna are that she requires great aim and can’t usually heal multiple characters at once. If you have crap aim like I do, this can be a pretty big barrier. Making up for that is the Ice Arts ability, which temporarily replaces her primary fire with long-range beam shots. Although the higher DMG and healing values are less effective due to the much lower firing rate, the beam has a sizable hitbox and can pierce teammates and enemies alike. It will also turn back into the normal primary fire with full ammo, so you can use this as a free reload of sorts.</p><p>The big takeaway here is not how great the ability is. While you can deal damage with these beams, it’s better to use them for healing. A notable downside to the Ice Arts ability is that landing any headshots won’t score you a critical hit. Being able to line up multiple enemies with a single shot can also be pretty situational. I strongly suggest using Ice Arts when your teammates are grouped up and in need of heals. That being said, just like Absolute Zero, this ability also provides self-healing. Don’t be afraid to use it if you’re in dire need of health.</p><h2 id="h285"><a id=""></a>Save your Ultimate for dicey situations</h2><figure id="" data-id="ed551ddafc5e850c9d78518d0cd33229" data-recommend-id="image://ed551ddafc5e850c9d78518d0cd33229" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Luna Snow poses with her hand in the air to signify the end of her ultimate." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Luna Snow poses with her hand in the air to signify the end of her ultimate." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Marvel Games / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="ed551ddafc5e850c9d78518d0cd33229" data-recommend-id="image://ed551ddafc5e850c9d78518d0cd33229" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Luna Snow poses with her hand in the air to signify the end of her ultimate." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Luna’s Ultimate is considered the most OP (overpowered) for good reason. For an unnecessarily long twelve seconds, she can swap between empowering allies around her with a 40% damage boost or healing them at a rate of 250 per second. That healing rate is enough to survive the harshest onslaughts and attacks outside a Scarlet Witch or Iron Man Ultimate. Save this move for when your team rushes to take over a point or situations where you’re struggling to defend against your opponents. It’s a ridiculous ability and I hate dealing with it when the opposing team uses it. However, I also love it when I get to use it, so I guess I’m part of the problem.</p><h2 id="h286"><a id=""></a>Make use of Iron Fist’s team-up attack if you have it</h2><p>Luna is one of the few characters who is a part of multiple <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/marvel-rivals-best-team-up-attacks-season-zero-1851733122&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/marvel-rivals-best-team-up-attacks-season-zero-1851733122">team-up abilities</a></span>. The one worth highlighting here is Frozen Chi, an ability she gains when teaming up with Iron Fist. Using it will discharge an icy ring that heals allies while also knocking back enemies and applying a slowing effect. It’s a fantastic addition to her kit that doubles as both another crowd control ability and area-of-effect healing.</p><p>Keep the above tips in mind and you’re sure to be the <em>Marvel Rivals</em> healer that everyone deserves. You might start to earn the coveted MVP and <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/marvel-rivals-svp-mean-rank-competitive-play-1851722265&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/marvel-rivals-svp-mean-rank-competitive-play-1851722265">SVP titles</a></span> more often too.</p><hr><p><br><em>Marvel Rivals</em> is available as a free-to-play game for PS5, Xbox Series X/S, and Windows.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Also shown was the option to upgrade Ana to be able to use her damage-reducing Nano Boost ultimate on herself, giving her a power boost and a degree of survivability she otherwise doesn’t have. This is the biggest fundamental change <em>Overwatch 2 </em>has introduced to its gameplay since the game launched. It’ll be implemented in quickplay and competitive modes in Season 15, beginning on February 18. We’ll have impressions on the site very soon.</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="0e8c9a9548ebfc570c7602c7b412905f" data-recommend-id="image://0e8c9a9548ebfc570c7602c7b412905f" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Hanzo holding a Galactic weapon." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Hanzo holding a Galactic weapon." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Blizzard Entertainment</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="0e8c9a9548ebfc570c7602c7b412905f" data-recommend-id="image://0e8c9a9548ebfc570c7602c7b412905f" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Hanzo holding a Galactic weapon." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Blizzard is adding new rewards to its Competitive mode, including a purple Galactic skin for weapons, and weapon charms that show off your rank.

The next version will spotlight one of the most controversial metas: <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/jeff-kaplan-knows-some-people-will-always-hate-overwatc-1831624036&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/jeff-kaplan-knows-some-people-will-always-hate-overwatc-1831624036">GOATS</a></span>. This three tanks/three supports meta was prominent in 2019 and widely considered one of the lowest-interest compositions to watch and play. Some theorize the reason Blizzard introduced Role Queue was to ensure competitive players can’t run the composition. If you’re feeling nostalgic, the GOATS <em>Overwatch Classic</em> will be available in Season 15.</p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="dbc67cf2fcba9686f5bf31ebf388f854" data-recommend-id="image://dbc67cf2fcba9686f5bf31ebf388f854" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Freya holds her crossbow." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Freya holds her crossbow." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Blizzard Entertainment</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="dbc67cf2fcba9686f5bf31ebf388f854" data-recommend-id="image://dbc67cf2fcba9686f5bf31ebf388f854" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Freya holds her crossbow." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>One of the big headliners of the presentation was Freja. She’s a new damage hero who was a member of the original Overwatch before it was disbanded. Blizzard describes her as a high-skill-ceiling hero due to the precision required to master her kit. She uses a crossbow, is able to leap up high and slow down time with her alternate fire, and has an ultimate that can drag enemies to a central point to rain down damage on them. Freja will join the roster in Season 16.</p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="6e1422e5c5f2d0602e7ff5ec53744092" data-recommend-id="image://6e1422e5c5f2d0602e7ff5ec53744092" data-format="jpg" data-width="2421" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Concept art of Aqua." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Concept art of Aqua." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Blizzard Entertainment</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="6e1422e5c5f2d0602e7ff5ec53744092" data-recommend-id="image://6e1422e5c5f2d0602e7ff5ec53744092" data-format="jpg" data-width="2421" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Concept art of Aqua." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>While we didn’t see the hero following Freja in motion, Blizzard did show concept art of a new character codenamed “Aqua.” This guy is a Chinese “water wielder” who has ”one of the most unique ability sets” in the game.

You’ll build one hero throughout a lengthy match that rapidly swaps between different maps and modes as a best-of-seven game. At the beginning of each round, players are given access to an armory and can spend earned points from the previous round to upgrade their character’s traits and abilities. Some examples given include Reaper being able to fly while in Wraith Form, Soldier: 76’s healing station gaining increased range and delivering a power boost to those in its radius, and Kiriko being able to teleport across the map without having to target an ally to do so. Blizzard describes Stadium as the ultimate “fantasy” of each hero, cranking their ability sets to an absurd level of destruction and chaos. </p><figure id="" data-id="bb9cd7795877aeb50aaf930f115464e7" data-recommend-id="image://bb9cd7795877aeb50aaf930f115464e7" data-format="jpg" data-width="1919" data-height="1079" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="D.Va's mod customization screen." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="D.Va's mod customization screen." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Blizzard Entertainment</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="bb9cd7795877aeb50aaf930f115464e7" data-recommend-id="image://bb9cd7795877aeb50aaf930f115464e7" data-format="jpg" data-width="1919" data-height="1079" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="D.Va's mod customization screen." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Another notable aspect of Stadium is that it can be played in either first person or&nbsp;third person. Blizzard says this is to help avoid screen clutter, which is only made worse as abilities become upgraded throughout the match. Stadium will launch with 14 heroes, with the rest of the cast added over time. We’ll have impressions of the mode on the site soon.</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="032382fb5e459c1c4f44ffbd0dc2b613" data-recommend-id="image://032382fb5e459c1c4f44ffbd0dc2b613" data-format="jpg" data-width="1870" data-height="1051" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Zenyatta's Mythic skin." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Zenyatta's Mythic skin." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Blizzard Entertainment</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="032382fb5e459c1c4f44ffbd0dc2b613" data-recommend-id="image://032382fb5e459c1c4f44ffbd0dc2b613" data-format="jpg" data-width="1870" data-height="1051" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Zenyatta's Mythic skin." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Blizzard ran down the handful of <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/overwatch-2-mythic-skin-store-prisms-battle-pass-mercy-1851414356&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/overwatch-2-mythic-skin-store-prisms-battle-pass-mercy-1851414356">customizable Mythic skins</a></span> coming over the course of the next three seasons.
