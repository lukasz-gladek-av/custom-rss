              <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/digmon-story-time-stranger-preview-pokemon-pc-ps5-xbox-1851784677"><i><span>Digimon Story: Time Stranger</span></i></a><span> is out next week. It’s the latest in the </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/digimon-story-time-stranger-digifarm-hands-on-preview-2000624093"><span>turn-based RPG series</span></a><span>, but these digital monsters have shown up in a lot more games than just RPGs. Across its nearly 30 years, </span><i><span>Digimon </span></i><span>has been pretty experimental in the video game space. Not every swing has landed, but it has kept things interesting. A few of these games never made their way out of Japan, but the best ones came stateside, though they’re harder to come by because companies do not care about preservation. If you’ve never played a </span><i><span>Digimon </span></i><span>game before, here are some of the best ones to go back to.</span></p> <h2><b><i>Digimon World </i></b><b>/ </b><b><i>Digimon World: Next Order</i></b></h2>  <p><span>Despite my dislike of the virtual pet mechanics of </span><i><span>Digimon World</span></i><span>, I know if I don’t include the original PlayStation game on this list, someone will get mad at me. As frustrating as it can be, </span><i><span>Digimon World</span></i><span>’s vibes are still unmatched by most of the franchise. There’s a true sense of loneliness as your character is isekai’d into the Digital World, aimlessly wandering through this unknowable realm and discovering new friends and enemies as you explore. It also still has that PS1-era grit that has kind of washed away from more modern </span><i><span>Digimon </span></i><span>games, which is especially effective when you’re young and these worlds still feel vast and scary. If you can train your Digimon into something powerful enough to fight through its various challenges, </span><i><span>Digimon World </span></i><span>has an expansive, fascinating world to watch grow over the course of the game. It’s the training part that can become tedious. But those with the patience to fight through it found a lot to love. </span><i><span>Next Order </span></i><span>is a modern spin on this same loop, and if you can handle it with one monster, that game lets you manage two at a time. Godspeed, friend.</span></p> <h2><b><i>Digimon Racing</i></b></h2>  <p><span>Wait, no. Come back. I swear, the Game Boy Advance kart racer rules, actually. If you ever played </span><i><span>Mario Kart </span></i><span>or </span><i><span>Sonic Racing, </span></i><span>you know the gist of what </span><i><span>Digimon Racing </span></i><span>has to offer. The </span><i><span>Digimon </span></i><span>spin is that the monster you put behind the wheel will gradually digivolve over the course of a race as you drift over a digitized track, gaining speed and power as you leave your opponents in the dust. </span><i><span>Digimon Racing </span></i><span>was also one of the only games that supported the GBA’s wireless adapter, as Nintendo was trying to cut the link cable in the lead-up to the Nintendo DS. I have some pretty fond memories of racing against my brother across our living room. It felt like magic at the time.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <h2><b><i>Digimon Rumble Arena 1+2</i></b></h2>  <p><span>Everyone has tried a </span><i><span>Super Smash Bros. </span></i><span>knock-off at some point, right? </span><i><span>Digimon Rumble Arena </span></i><span>and its sequel may not have become competitive darlings that had people dragging CRT TVs to conventions decades later, but they’re silly, fun party games starring your favorite Digital Monsters. The first game was on the original PlayStation and only supported two players, which could make some fights a bit of a drag as they devolved into games of tag with the two fighters chasing each other around the large arenas. </span><i><span>Rumble Arena 2 </span></i><span>came out two years later and leaned harder into the </span><i><span>Super Smash Bros. </span></i><span>comparison, supporting four players and making fights much more active, frantic, and fun.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <h2><b><i>Digimon World 2</i></b></h2>  <p><span>The original </span><i><span>Digimon World </span></i><span>game implemented the series’ digital pet mechanics in a way that some people get really into. Personally I can’t stand it, and was annoyed when it came back in </span><i><span>Digimon World: Next Order</span></i><span>. Do you know how annoying it is to try to train your partner Digimon for an hour, only for them to end up turning into one of the poop monsters? However, the </span><i><span>World </span></i><span>series has changed a fair bit over the years, too. </span><i><span>Digimon World 2 </span></i><span>left the first game’s real-time digital pet era behind, and is instead a dungeon crawler with turn-based battles. The battle system isn’t too deep, but its elaborate, experimental Digivolution mechanics set the tone for future iterations.</span></p>

 <h2><b><i>Digimon Survive</i></b></h2>  <p><i><span>Digimon Survive </span></i><span>isn’t a great tactical RPG, but it is a damn good visual novel. The combat is mind-numbingly simple and lacks the depth of much older classics like </span><i><span>Final Fantasy Tactics</span></i><span>. That said, its choice-driven horror story visual novel side is actually a pretty gripping tale that really brings a fresh take to the universe. </span><i><span>Survive</span></i><span>’s tedious fights are worth slogging through to get to the rich, often harrowing story it has to tell.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <h2><b><i>Digimon World 3</i></b></h2>  <p><span>If </span><i><span>Digimon World 2 </span></i><span>brought the subseries into turn-based battles, </span><i><span>World 3 </span></i><span>solidified it with a solid, more streamlined system in one of the coolest versions of the Digital World. The RPG’s roster of Digimon is much more limited, but its challenge comes from working within its set party compositions and finding a party that works for you in all its limitations. Outside of battles, its gorgeous PS1-era sprite work still holds up. Meanwhile, its dark story of a group of people trapped within a virtual reality MMO is a bit rote by today’s standards, but was pretty unnerving back in the day. Plus, it was the first time Guilmon, the best Digimon, got to have a starring role in one of the RPGs. More than most </span><i><span>Digimon </span></i><span>games, I constantly wish I could go back to </span><i><span>World 3</span></i><span>, but it’s been trapped on the original PlayStation for over 20 years.</span></p> <h2><b><i>Digimon Story: Cyber Sleuth</i></b></h2>  <p><span>I just finished a replay of </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/digimon-story-cyber-sleuth-switch-pc-sale-hacker-memory-1851784914"><i><span>Digimon Story: Cyber Sleuth</span></i></a> <span>earlier this year, and that shit holds up. The turn-based detective RPG is one of the series’ best stories, and it perfectly marries the franchise’s mysteries, mythology, and themes of the power of friendship. It is the closest to a </span><i><span>Persona </span></i><span>game the series has ever gotten, and though its turn-based battles are pretty simple, the game, with its elaborate evolution mechanics that enable you, through careful planning and metagaming, to turn just about any Digimon into almost any of the other 200+ on the roster, is dripping with depth. The </span><i><span>Hacker’s Memory </span></i><span>follow-up, which you can find packaged with the original game on PC and Switch, adds another 50 hours of parallel story that’s also worth your time. If you haven’t played the game before and are curious about </span><i><span>Time Stranger</span></i><span>, you won’t find a better onboarding on modern platforms than </span><i><span>Cyber Sleuth</span></i><span>.</span></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/helldivers-2-kotaku-review-pc-ps5-is-it-good-ps-plus-1851258251"><em>Helldivers 2</em></a> was, at one point, going to be a free-to-play game that would have been “completely” different than what we got in 2024. And this pivot is part of the reason why <em>Helldivers 2</em> has some nasty performance problems.</p> <p>When <a href="https://kotaku.com/helldivers-2-xbox-update-terminid-2000620349"><em>Helldivers 2</em></a> launched on PS5 and PC early last year, it quickly became a massive hit for PlayStation and developers Arrowhead. And since then, the sci-fi co-op shooter has remained popular as more updates have expanded the game, adding new weapons, enemies, locations, and more. But in recent months, players have complained about performance issues and technical problems.&nbsp; <a href="https://kotaku.com/helldivers-2-new-content-bug-fixes-1851419351">Arrowhead’s CEO, Shams Jorjani,</a> isn’t shying away from these criticisms and is directly addressing them in the official <em>Helldivers 2</em> Discord server. And it’s here that he also revealed that at one point in time, <em>Helldivers 2</em> was a much smaller game that was planned to be free-to-play and not a paid experience.</p> <p><a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/third-person-shooter/arrowhead-ceo-blames-helldivers-2-performance-issues-on-tech-debt-accumulated-thanks-to-goalposts-being-moved-a-few-times-during-development-the-foundations-of-this-big-tower-were-made-for-a-little-bungalow/">On September 25</a>, while talking to fans about <em><a href="https://kotaku.com/helldivers-2-sequel-dei-politics-woke-arrowhead-1851731175">Helldivers 2</a> a</em>nd its ongoing performance issues on console and PC on Discord, Jorjani explained that the shooter had a lot of built-up “tech debt” from various pivots that happened during development.</p> <p>“[<em>Helldivers 2</em>] started as a AA game,” <a href="https://discord.com/channels/1102970375731691612/1102973812179488798/1420832196813389824">said the CEO</a>. “[It] then grew in scope, then pivoted to a launch title for PS5, then pivoted to F2P, then back to premium ( I might have the order messed up) – so the goal posts were moved a few times – so the foundations of this big tower were made for a little bungalow on the beach.”</p>

 <p>As far as I know, this is the first time it’s been officially confirmed by anyone at Arrowhead publicly that <em>Helldivers 2</em> was at one point planned to be free-to-play. It’s interesting to think about now, and according to Jorjani, that version of the game would have had a “completely different content pipeline” and would have likely been a very different game compared to what we actually got.</p>

 <p>“I wasn’t with Arrowhead back then so I don’t know – but the model was always to give away as much nice stuff for free and monetize other things,” said Jorjani. “It would have been a completely different angle. It [would have] required a completely different content pipeline.”</p>

 <p>Making all of these changes and pivots during development led to a lot of tech debt, which the CEO says is a big reason the game’s performance is “so-so.” But they are planning to improve things in the future, with the CEO telling fans in the Discord that improving the game is like cleaning out a garage.</p> <p>“Tech debt is like a garage filled with stuff you just chucked in,” said the CEO. “We really need to put up shelves in the back to get organized.” This isn’t the first time he’s talked about the game’s tech debt causing issues. <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/third-person-shooter/helldivers-2-ceo-just-comes-out-and-says-it-the-technical-debt-is-crippling-and-we-didnt-hit-the-mark-with-into-the-unjust-update-so-arrowhead-is-trying-to-get-our-s-in-order/">Earlier this month,</a> he reiterated that<em> Helldivers 2</em> wasn’t in a great place and that the team needed to get their “shit in order” and fix it.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/final-fantasy-7-remake-rebirth-switch-2-xbox-port-part-3-2000629254</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/live-action-beauty-and-the-beast-was-an-inspiration-for-ff7-remake-trilogy-says-director.1310022/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Square Enix arguably broke the internet about 10 years ago when it finally revealed it was working on a long-anticipated remake of <i>Final Fantasy 7</i>. Now, in 2025, two parts of this trilogy project have arrived on PlayStation and PC, with ports expected on Switch 2 and Xbox in the near future.</p> <p>Speaking with a number of outlets, <i>Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth</i>’s director Naoki Hamaguchi shed some light on <i>FF7 Remake</i>’s upcoming arrival on Switch 2 and Xbox, what it took to get the game running on less powerful hardware, how <i>Rebirth</i> is shaping up on Switch 2, and which <i>Final Fantasy</i> he’d be eager to see remade next.</p> <h2>The key to the Switch 2’s <i>FF7R</i> port was nailing the lighting</h2> <p><a href="https://screenrant.com/ff7-remake-director-interview-rebirth-switch-2-confirmed/">Speaking to <i>ScreenRant</i></a>, Hamaguchi zeroed in on “character expressions” and “lighting” as being essential to delivering a quality experience on Nintendo’s hybrid console:</p>

 <blockquote><p>Our aim was to align more towards the lightning we see in the PS5 version, and then we also kind of balance this by aligning more towards the sort of switch to post-effect and fog. And in this way the user is not really able to make out a huge difference</p></blockquote> <p><a href="https://www.inverse.com/gaming/final-fantasy-7-remake-switch-2-xbox">In an interview with <i>Inverse</i></a>, Hamaguchi said that a Switch 2 port seemed likely early on once “Nintendo first shared with [Square Enix] the new hardware […] the thought came to me that <i>Final Fantasy 7 </i>can likely run on these specs.”</p>

 <p>According to Hamaguchi, the Xbox version was already in the works before the team got their first look at the Switch 2 hardware. And, contrary to what you may think, the underpowered Series S wasn’t much of an issue. Though the team has run into some memory problems on Series S, Hamaguchi still describes Microsoft’s budget console as “quite high in terms of specs.”</p>

 <p><i>FF7 Remake</i> isn’t the only part of the remake project headed to Switch 2. The more graphically ambitious <i>Rebirth</i> is also expected to arrive at some point in the future. Hamaguchi described <i>Rebirth</i> as being in a “working state” on Switch 2. “Our desire was to be able to ultimately offer and serve all of the platforms available,” Hamaguchi told <i>ScreenRant</i>. He declined to say, however, whether or not the third installment will arrive as a multiplatform title on day one.</p>

 <h2>Development on part three of <i>FF7</i> remake’s trilogy is ‘going extremely well’</h2> <p>The <i>FF7 </i>remake project is still ongoing, with a yet-unnamed third entry on the horizon. Hamaguchi describes development as “going extremely well.” “A lot of the content is already playable,” <a href="https://automaton-media.com/en/final-fantasy/final-fantasy-7-rebirth-is-selling-well-no-need-to-worry-about-the-trilogys-finale-director-naoki-hamaguchi-says/">he told <i>Automaton</i></a>, “and the game’s direction and form are firmly set in place. Right now the team is united around refining everything.”</p>

 <p><i>FF7</i>’s remakes have certainly impressed a number of fans, but concerns over the sales of the last entry and the general direction of the various plot changes do remain. For his part, Hamaguchi has described <i>Rebirth</i> as “doing very well on both PS5 and PC” in terms of sales. He also shared with <i>ScreenRant</i> how the recent live-action <i>Beauty and the Beast</i> remake inspired his decisions in reinterpreting <i>FF7</i> for the remake trilogy:</p> <blockquote><p>When development [on <i>FF7 Remake</i>] was happening, the <i>Beauty and the Beast</i> movie remake was released. That movie, the original, was one I watched as a child. And then they now had the live-action that’s a remake…I saw the overall story and the world itself was not altered, but it was completely deconstructed in a way to really entertain today’s viewers, which was deeply satisfying.</p></blockquote> <p>Although <i>FF7</i>’s remake chapters have occupied his time, Hamaguchi has spent some time daydreaming about other possible remakes in the classic JRPG series. <a href="https://www.windowscentral.com/gaming/xbox/final-fantasy-7-director-on-xbox">Speaking to <i>Windows Central</i></a>, the director described <i>FF6</i> as his favorite, saying “That would be very cool to take on as a remake. I’ve put my heart and soul into the <i>Final Fantasy 7 Remake</i> series for over a decade now. Working on something completely new would be quite fun as well.”</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>If you’ve been perusing for a fancy new tablet, <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4336/">do take note that the Samsung Galaxy Tab A9+ just got its price chopped down over at Amazon.</a> Usually this Samsung tablet starts at&nbsp; $220, but right now you can score the 11-inch Android for just $159. The 28% discount amounts to a savings of $61. That’s for the 64 GB model by the way. Double your storage, and you can still save as the 128 GB model dropped from $270 to just $209. That one is a 23% discount which works also out to you saving $61. Both versions are available in either black or silver.</p>
<p>This 2024 Galaxy tablet has a nice and large 11-inch LCD screen which can display in resolutions of up to 1200p with a refresh rate of 90 Hz. According to the product page, the Galaxy Tab A9+ can deliver a “cinema-like audio experience,” which is, uh, an obvious embellishment. No one is expecting something you can hold in your hands to match that of an AMC theater. What this is really saying is the tablet has Dolby Atmos support. You can expect terrific sound that’s loud and clear as far as tablets go coming from the on-board speakers.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4336/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<p>The build of the Galaxy tablet is slim and light, yet durable —exactly what you’d hope for on a device you’d likely to take with you out and about. Bring it from home to your office, down to a coffee house, then over to a friend’s no problem.</p>
<p>Storage we covered. You have a choice between either 64 GB or 128 GB. The price jump from one to the next is an even $50. If you expect to be downloading a bunch of movies or TV shows or storing tons of photos, you may decide it’s best to splurge. Otherwise if streaming and documents saved to the cloud will be the main way you use it, just stick with the cheaper 64 GB.</p>



<h2>Full Flexibility</h2>
<p>Android OS is able to run multiple apps at the same time, allowing you to view them side-by-side. This is excellent when multitasking, letting you work more efficiently. You can even view multiple tabs in you web browser next to each other. Transferring files is easy as Quick Share allows you to send stuff to another nearby device with just a couple button presses.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4336/">If you have little ones at home, they can enjoy your Samsung Galaxy Tab A9+ as well</a>. The Samsung Kids app is filled with all sorts of playful and colorful content to keep them entertained.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><em>Vandal Hearts II</em> is an obscure strategy RPG sequel produced by Konami at the end of the PS1’s life. Few played it but many who did will cherish it forever. Now its oldest and weirdest mystery has finally be solved. A reference to Konami’s classic shoot ’em up series <em>Gradius</em> mentioned a special sword in the game’s files that no one could ever get to spawn without hacks. Fans thought up all sorts of wild theories about the “intended” way to unlock the secret, including maybe needing very specific save files from other Konami games like<em> Suikoden</em>. It turns out that they actually needed a super-rare demo disc.</p> <p>The Gradius Sword in <em>Vandal Hearts II</em> isn’t just a fun little Easter egg. The weapon contains a powerful spell called “Ripple Laser” that summons an actual 3D model of <em>Gradius</em>‘ ship, the Vic Viper, to fly across the battlefield and blow up enemies. It’s pretty powerful and has a surprisingly ornate animation for something that no one was ever able to discover in the game naturally. The result has been decades of random threads across <a href="https://gamefaqs.gamespot.com/boards/199180-vandal-hearts-ii/80436904?page=2">message boards like GameFAQs</a> and elsewhere as fans tried to figure out what you could actually do in the game to trigger the Gradius Sword to appear.</p> <p>Three years ago, the tiny <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXjQ4JRg9fo">YouTube account Dragon Quarter</a> reposted footage of the Ripple Laser skill in action that was originally uploaded in 2010. Then last night, Dragon Quarter returned with a major update. “After getting a tip from a follower (who I realize now got their tip from a recent post on&nbsp;<a href="https://gamefaqs.gamespot.com/boards/199180-vandal-hearts-ii/80436904?page=1" target="_blank" rel="nofollow ugc noopener">GameFAQs</a>) of Twitch streamer&nbsp;<a href="https://www.twitch.tv/karkalla" target="_blank" rel="nofollow ugc noopener">Karkalla</a>, who is currently playing through <em>Vandal Hearts II</em> for the first time, I have confirmed the Gradius Sword was originally unlocked by downloading a special save data file from Dengeki PlayStation D22 (SLPM-80471), a demo disc included with <em>Dengeki PlayStation Magazine</em> Issue 116 (dated 1999-09-24),” they <a href="https://www.resetera.com/threads/a-decades-old-mystery-about-a-hidden-unlockable-gradius-sword-in-vandal-hearts-ii-for-playstation-has-finally-been-figured-out.1309491/">posted</a> on ResetEra on Friday.</p>

  <p>According to GameFAQs user Kern, the discovery came after finding a reference to the demo disc on an older Japanese site. “Someone on a discord who had some old discs found the file on the D22 disc (which you can get from ebay),” they wrote. “I wasn’t able to verify it personally myself but he posted images of the file, and he was able to open the save file on an English copy and the Gradius sword was available for purchase.” Dragon Quarter has since confirmed it as well.</p>

 <p>This is the kind of deep gaming lore I thrive on. For years, random players <a href="https://gamefaqs.gamespot.com/boards/199180-vandal-hearts-ii/53785268">on forums have claimed</a> to have found the weapon early on in <em>Vandal Hearts II</em> just by chance. Is it possible there’s some one in a million chance for it to just spawn randomly without the demo disc data? Who knows. It seems clear that Konami at least intended for it to be an exclusive bonus for owners of the demo disc, similar to the deluxe edition pre-orders of today that let players begin a game with unique upgrades and gear.</p> <p>The most absurd theory by far was that you needed to have a final Gregminster save point from the original<em> Suikoden</em> on a memory card to get the Gradius Sword to appear in the shop. When that was debunked a couple of years ago, many players had resigned themselves to the weapon only being available via some hacked save file from “Jean” that was uploaded to GameFAQs over a decade ago. Now players can get it the “official” way by downloading a <a href="https://gamefaqs.gamespot.com/ps/199180-vandal-hearts-ii/saves">copy of the demo disc save</a> and using a PS3 memory card converter to get the data onto a PS1 memory card.</p>
