              <p>We’re fairly used to Nintendo making strange or iconoclastic decisions, whether it’s releasing folding two-screen portable gaming devices or announcing a <a href="https://kotaku.com/virtual-boy-nintendo-switch-classics-2000625301">Virtual Boy peripheral for the Switch 2</a>, but even now the Japanese games company is capable of surprises. It has just uploaded to its various worldwide YouTube channels a stunning four-minute animated short called <em>Close to You</em>, about a baby learning to take their first steps, and there’s no explanation for why. Is it a Princess Peach origin story? Something to do with Rosalina? Is it something to do with <em>Pikmin</em> of all things?</p> <p>It is a truly wonderful cartoon. Evoking Pixar in almost every possible way (complete with&nbsp;<em>Incredibles</em>-like faces), the short shows the mother of a baby just popping out of the room, after which the baby’s toys begin to become animated. Wooden blocks hop about and a rattle rolls itself to the baby’s foot. While enjoying the rattle, the kid’s pacifier falls out of their mouth, and that too comes to life, playfully moving around and evading the baby’s attempts to grab it back. In the end, it gets wedged in a mobile dangling above the baby’s crib, giving the tyke the motivation to reach higher and attempt their first steps.</p>

  <p>There’s obviously no way to know if this baby is a boy or a girl, let alone the child form of a particular character. Given the kid’s white with blonde hair, it could be either Zelda or Link, or Samus, or pretty much any gaming character bar Mario or Toad. Hell, my hair was that blonde as a baby, maybe it&nbsp;<em>is</em> Mario. (It isn’t.)</p>

 <p>Someone has claimed that there’s a Red Pikmin appearing in the video at 1:40. Um, I paused it there, and here it is! But there are musical nods to the&nbsp;<em>Pikmin</em> series in here, and they’re certainly the sorts of mischievous creatures who would move toys around a room.</p>

 <figure id="attachment_2000632540" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000632540"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000632540">© Nintendo / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p>The only credit at any point is “<b><span>© </span></b>Nintendo” at the bottom right at the end of the video, with no mention of Illumination, the animation house behind&nbsp;<em>The Super Mario Bros. Movie</em> and its forthcoming <em>Mario Galaxy </em>sequel. It’d make some sense if it were related to that, perhaps depicting a moment from Princess Peach’s childhood? She’s fairly magical, and the pink of the pacifier points in that direction. Then again, the blue of the onesie implies Rosalina. Actually, that’d make sense, given the next movie is set in the <em>Super Mario Galaxy</em> universe, and that’s the game in which she first appeared. Let’s go with that! Starting over…</p> <hr> <h2>Nintendo Reveals Rosalina’s Origin Story In Animated Short</h2> <figure id="attachment_2000632541" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000632541"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000632541">© Nintendo / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p>Nintendo today has posted a four-minute animated short to its YouTube channels, revealing the beginnings of fan-favorite&nbsp;<em>Super Mario Galaxy</em> character Rosalina, to coincide with the upcoming <em>The Super Mario Bros. Movie</em> sequel,&nbsp;<em>The Super Mario Galaxy Movie</em>. Rosalina, the resident of the Comet Observatory and mother figure to the game’s star-shaped Lumas, will obviously play a central role in the forthcoming film, so it only makes sense to see her being highlighted here…</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/amazon-has-surprised-everyone-the-kindle-is-practically-a-gift-if-youre-a-prime-member-2000632519</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/amazon-has-surprised-everyone-the-kindle-is-practically-a-gift-if-you%E2%80%99re-a-prime-member.1318615/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>If you’ve been waiting for the right moment to finally grab a Kindle, that moment just arrived. Amazon rarely discounts its e-readers, especially the base model that consistently tops the bestseller lists. Summer is peak reading season so the retailer typically holds prices steady through the July Prime Day when demand is already high.</p>
<p>But this Prime Big Deal Days event has brought an unexpected surprise for Prime members: <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4586/">the newest Kindle model is down to $84, reduced from $109</a>. That’s an <strong>all-time low on the lightest and most compact Kindle</strong> Amazon has ever made, and it solves one of the biggest frustrations readers face: lugging around heavy books or scrolling through distracting phone screens when you’re trying to lose yourself in a story.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4586/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Why You Have to Choose This Kindle</h2>
<p>This latest generation Kindle (2024) eliminates the little irritations that previously made e-readers <strong>slow to react or more difficult to read</strong> under certain circumstances. The <strong>front light is also increased by 25%</strong> at its highest setting over its predecessor so you are free to read comfortably even in direct sunlight without eye strain or having to shift position to prevent glare. The <strong>6-inch display is also purely glare-proof</strong>&nbsp;so being outdoors by the pool or on a park bench becomes just as comfortable a place to read as being indoors. There is <strong>also a dark mode setting</strong> whereby the text and background are reversed and gives white text on a black display for midnight reading sessions.</p>



<p><strong>Page turns are significantly quicker now</strong> which may sound like a trivial thing but becomes a real distinction when you’re engrossed in a thriller and whizzing through pages rapidly. The increased contrast ratio causes text to seem sharper and darker against the background and better replicates the sensation of reading ink on paper than before.</p>
<p><strong>Battery life is six weeks between charges</strong> if we assume a reading of about 30 minutes per day by shutting off wireless and setting the light to a luminous 13. If you read longer hours or leave wireless on so your reading stays current among multiple devices, a few weeks of life remain until it’s necessary to charge it.</p>



<p>The <strong>16GB of capacity stores thousands of books</strong>, a number far greater than most individuals will want to keep current at a single moment. Even if your downloads are a delicate balancing act between text-heavy novels and graphics-intensive comics or magazines, you’ll have quite a bit of capacity left for other titles. The reader itself <strong>is Amazon’s thinnest and lightest Kindle</strong>, weighing a mere 5.56 ounces.</p>
<p>One of the greatest benefits of reading a book on a Kindle rather than a phone or a tablet is total lack of distraction: There are <strong>no text messages flashing, no urge to see what’s new by email, no social media scrolling</strong> and no other programs demanding your focus. You turn on the thing, resume where you left off, and read. That’s it.</p>
<p>This is a members-only deal for Prime members during the Prime Big Deal Days, and it’s also a record-low price for this model, at $84. If it’s been on your mind to pick up an e-reader, or it’s been a couple of years since you’ve picked up a Kindle, it’s your turn yet.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/dyson-v11-cordless-vacuum-at-lowest-price-yet-ahead-of-prime-day-2000631582</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/dyson-v11-origin-cordless-vacuum-just-dropped-below-the-older-v8-pricing-for-amazon-prime-day.1318552/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>We’re under a week out from Prime Big Deals Day. This is Amazon’s two-day sales event where you’ll be able to find steep discounts on products across every category — tech, home goods, automotive, you name it. Despite the even not starting until Tuesday, October 7, you can already start finding some great deals right now. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4478/">The Dyson V11 Origin cordless vacuum has dropped to $400 for Prime users. The stick vacuum normally goes for $630 so you’d be saving a full $230.</a> That’s a 37% discount and it’s not even Prime Big Deals Day yet.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4478/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>
<p>Convenience is really prime selling point for a cordless stick vacuum and the Dyson V11 is no exception. This vacuum is easy to move around throughout the home. It’s both lightweight and ergonomic so you can pick it up and clean up high up hard to reach places with ease. Transform the vacuum into a handheld, making it ever easier to maneuver while still not losing any power. That makes it a perfect tool for taking care of the interior of your car before before the next time it’s your turn to drive the friend group.</p>

<h2>Remove Pet Hair From Your Home</h2>
<p>Pet owners wouldn’t give up our furry little friends for the world, but we could sure do without all the hair that falls off of them. It digs into the carpet and can retain that very distinct odor that makes guests who walk in for the first time go, “hey do you have a dog?” Well, the Dyson V11 stick vacuum can help keep your couches and carpets free of fur. The vac comes with a hair screw tool, conical in shape, which can help get hair detangled while you’re going about cleaning your home. The Motorbar cleaner can automatically clear any hair that’s gotten wrapped up around the brush bar.</p>



<p>The vacuum is cordless, so it’s running off of a battery. That battery can last you approximately 100 minutes on a single charge. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4478/">That’s roughly an hour longer than the Dyson V8 can hold up, which is a lot after considering that the V11’s motor spins at 125,000rpm and generates 60% more power than the V8</a>. When the vacuum is not in use, it can be neatly stored against the wall dock, recharging it on its own while its been put away. The LCD screen atop the vacuum shows you exactly how much battery life you have left so you won’t have any unexpected stops while vacuuming because your forgot to charge.</p>

              <p>As the AI plagiarism machines continue to churn out ever-more semi-realistic slop, including <a href="https://kotaku.com/sora-2-update-pokemon-nintendo-openai-sam-altman-ai-2000632089">videos of OpenAI’s CEO Sam Altman eating a barbecued Pikachu</a>, the harm to any number of industries is incalculable. But there is also the personal harm, and no one has captured it better than actor and director Zelda Williams, daughter of the late Robin Williams, in a recent post on her Instagram.</p> <p>As <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/software/ai/zelda-williams-ethers-ai-tributes-to-her-dead-dad-youre-making-disgusting-over-processed-hotdogs-out-of-the-lives-of-human-beings/">reported by&nbsp;<em>PC Gamer</em></a>, Zelda Williams posted an Instagram story (that has since expired) in which she begged her followers to “just stop sending me AI videos of Dad.”</p> <p>Sora, the AI video app from OpenAI, is flooding the internet with macabre depictions of both dead and living celebrities and public figures saying and doing things they’ve never said nor done. Obviously this can be enormously damaging for people’s reputations, with credulous viewers reposting such footage as fact. But what doesn’t always get thought about is how it affects the loved ones of those depicted, especially of those who have died. Such videos don’t need to be outlandish or offensive to achieve this, either—if anything, the more benign a video is, <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@stealthlurking/video/7557903802280594702?q=sora%20robin%20williams&amp;t=1759840729478">the more insidious and upsetting it can be</a>.</p>

 <p>“Stop believing I wanna see it or that I’ll understand, I don’t and I won’t,” Williams wrote in her post. “If you’re just trying to troll me, I’ve seen way worse, I’ll restrict and move on. But please, if you’ve got any decency, just stop doing this to him and to me, to everyone even, full stop. It’s dumb, it’s a waste of time and energy, and believe me, it’s NOT what he’d want.”</p>

 <p>As Rich Stanton points out in his&nbsp;<em>PCG</em> article, Robin Williams was famous for not wanting his face and voice used to hawk any old plastic tat, so it’s especially vile to note the constant dripping from the AI sewage pipe that’s putting words into his mouth. As his daughter puts it, “To watch the legacies of real people be condensed down to ‘this vaguely looks and sounds like them so that’s enough’, just so other people can churn out horrible TikTok slop puppeteering them is maddening.”</p>

 <p>“You’re not making art,” Zelda Williams continues. “You’re making disgusting, over-processed hotdogs out of the lives of human beings, out of the history of art and music, and then shoving them down someone else’s throat hoping they’ll give you a little thumbs up and like it. Gross.”</p>

 <p>And then, in unimprovable words, the actor sums up everything that’s so grim about it all:</p> <blockquote><p>And for the love of EVERYTHING, stop calling it ‘the future,’ AI is just badly recycling and regurgitating the past to be re-consumed. You are taking in the Human Centipede of content, and from the very very end of the line, all while the folks at the front laugh and laugh, consume and consume.</p></blockquote> <p id="dea0a845-47f5-4786-9ec0-3212f05d3981-2">Even OpenAI is <a href="https://kotaku.com/sora-2-update-pokemon-nintendo-openai-sam-altman-ai-2000632089">balking</a> at the way the just-launched Sora 2 is being used, with Altman backtracking on its ability to use any copyrighted materials, saying from now on companies will have to opt in. But this offers nothing to protect individuals, or their loved ones, from being depicted in such intrusive and ghoulish ways.</p> <p>Remember when AI was going to do all the boring jobs for us so we could live happier, freer lives? Yeah, turns out all it’s capable of is cheap tricks and making people sad.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/forget-the-iphone-17-amazon-is-offloading-the-new-pixel-10-for-2x-cheaper-this-prime-day-2000632506</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/forget-the-iphone%E2%80%AF17-amazon-is-offloading-the-new-pixel%E2%80%AF10-for-2x-cheaper-this-prime-day.1318492/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>The new Google Pixel 10 just landed, and if you’ve been eyeing a phone that can keep up with your daily chaos while delivering pro-level photos without the pro-level hassle, this deal is hard to ignore. Amazon <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4585/">just dropped the price of the 128GB model to $649 for Prime members, down from $799</a>. That’s a rare discount on a flagship device that literally came out weeks ago and is already going toe-to-toe with the iPhone 17 and Galaxy S25.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4585/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Why the Pixel 10 is Different</h2>
<p>The <strong>6.3-inch Actua display is a major strength</strong>: With a peak brightness of 3,000 nits, you actually get to see what’s on your display when you’re outdoors under direct sunlight, no longer squinting or covering the phone with your hand to view a text message. The display is covered by Corning’s scratch-resistant Gorilla Glass Victus 2, and the phone boasts an IP68 rating for dust and water resistance.</p>
<p>The camera system is where Google shows off: That improved triple rear camera array now boasts a 5x telephoto lens, driving its Super Res Zoom to a whopping 20x, so you can snap clear, sharp shots of your child’s soccer goal from across the sideline, for example, or of that street musician across the courtyard without your picture ending up a grainy mess. Night Sight, meanwhile, still wows by delivering clean, clear images even when lighting is awful, say, indoors at a poorly lit restaurant or after a sunset walk. A new feature called <em>Camera Coach</em> also provides real-time advice to assist with nailing your composition and exposures so it’s not a guessing game of being on manual mode nor pure auto mode.</p>



<p><strong>Battery life sits at 24-plus hours</strong> on a single charge with fast-charging support, so you’re not tethered to an outlet by mid-afternoon. This is an unlocked Android phone, giving you full freedom to switch carriers whenever you want and choose your own data plan. It works seamlessly with Google Fi, Verizon, T-Mobile, AT&amp;T, and other major carriers, so you’re not locked into one ecosystem or stuck with a device that only plays nice with a single network.</p>
<p><strong>Gemini AI integration is where the Pixel 10 moves ahead of the pack</strong>. Instead of having to type out every question or task, you’re free to speak naturally via Gemini Live. Point your camera at something interesting, like an unknown plant on a hike or a sea creature at the aquarium, and Gemini will identify it and give you context. You’re also free to chat with Gemini to brainstorm ideas, compose an email, schedule your day, or have things done across multiple apps without having to manually switch between each one. It’s an assistant kind of feature that is useful as opposed to gimmicky.</p>
<p>This obsidian version of the 128GB model is just offered at this market for Prime members during the Prime Big Deal Days, and as new as the Pixel 10 is, a discount like this is rare. Make sure you don’t miss it.</p>
