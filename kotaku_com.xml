              <p>A generation of Nintendo fans grew up playing the <em>Kirby Air Ride</em> on GameCube at every sleepover. And now this slept on kart racer’s franchise is finally coming back. It’s kind of crazy that the Nintendo Switch 2 is only getting a small handful of exclusive titles this year and two of them are kart racers. I guess Mr. Sakurai—director of the <em>Super Smash Bros.</em> games and creator of Kirby—really just wanted to see his pink ball back in the driver’s seat of a warp store and <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4307/">Nintendo said “Fine.”&nbsp;<em>Kirby Air Riders </em>is now available for pre-order over at Amazon.</a></p>
<p>The first <em>Kirby Air Ride</em> had a limited roster, just letting you race as different colors of Kirby. You could unlock Meta Knight and King DeDeDe, but they did not allow the option to choose your machine.&nbsp;<em>Kirby Air Riders</em> is fixing that by giving you a huge new cast of racers — all of which have full access to the different machines to race on. Choose between Kirby, King Dedede, Meta Knight, Bandana Waddle Dee, Chef Kawasaki, and so many more characters. Each racer has their own unique special move they can unleash to give them the edge in a race.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4307/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<p>The machine choices have greatly expanded, but lots of fan favorites are returning. the speedy Turbo Star, the slippery Slick Star, and the intimidating Rex Wheelie are all back. New machines such as the heavyweight Battle Chariot are looking to be a fun time as well.</p>
<h2>City Trial Is Back</h2>
<p>Real fans of <em>Kirby Air Ride</em> know that the heart of this game is not in the racing modes. No, sir. You play this game for one thing and one thing only — City Trial. This multiplayer free roam mode is back in <em>Kirby Air Riders</em> and it’s looking to be better than ever before. Zip around the floating city known as Skyah as you have minutes to find a good machine, collect power-ups and upgrades, then compete against up to 16 players online in a random field event. These could be standard races, battles to the death, darts but on karts, and so much more.</p>



<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4307/">You can pre-order either the physical version or a digital code which you can enter into your Nintendo Switch 2 to install on release.</a> The game is set to release later this Fall on November 20. Pre-order today for $70. Remember before pre-ordering that this title is exclusive to the Nintendo Switch 2 and will not run on your old, standard Nintendo Switch console</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Good morning and good day. I’m very busy right now, so let’s not waste any time and get right to today’s news. Welcome to Morning Checkpoint, <em>Kotaku’s</em> daily roundup of news and other stuff you might care about. This time we’ve got info on a big <em>FBC</em> update, news on multiplayer in the <em>MGS3 </em>remake, and some other stuff, but I’m very busy and…yeah, okay, cool. Bye.</p> <h2><strong>Remedy is trying again to relaunch its failed co-op shooter</strong></h2> <p><em><a href="https://kotaku.com/fbc-firebreak-remedy-co-op-fomo-live-service-preview-1851771133">FBC: Firebreak</a>,</em> Remedy’s co-op shooter released earlier this year, hasn’t been a big hit for the studio. While I enjoyed it for a few days, the game failed to hook me due to finicky menus, frustrating progression issues, and other complications that made it hard to enjoy with friends. Since launch, Remedy has spent a lot of time fixing and improving the game. <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2272540/view/530984095140809426">Now, as announced in a Steam post on September 25</a>, the studio is releasing a massive free content update that will change <em>FBC</em> in some big ways.</p> <div><blockquote data-bluesky-uri="at://did:plc:4nci4ly3xu3nau7hzr373bte/app.bsky.feed.post/3lznz3jf2wo2y" data-bluesky-cid="bafyreialowfft3zs2hlowkpcwh6mttkp6u4rh2fmwzw4ujmspttjwsqtqe"> <p>Our 1st free Major Update to FBC: Firebreak launches on September 29th. Breakpoint brings with it systemic overhauls, new content, and quality-of-life improvements. </p> <p>Read our latest blog post for all the details (it's a big one): https://bit.ly/BreakpointFBCFirebreak </p> <p>#FBCFirebreak</p> <p>— <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/did:plc:4nci4ly3xu3nau7hzr373bte?ref_src=embed">Remedy Entertainment (@remedygames.com)</a> <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/did:plc:4nci4ly3xu3nau7hzr373bte/post/3lznz3jf2wo2y?ref_src=embed">2025-09-25T13:01:03.362358702Z</a></p></blockquote></div>  <p>The new update, named “Breakpoint,” is launching on all platforms on September 29. Perhaps the biggest change in this new update is the removal of the Job Board. It’s being replaced with a Crisis Board that fills up with randomly generated missions with various modifiers. The idea is to make <em>FBC</em> more replayable, surprising, and chaotic. To help with that, Remedy is also adding more variety to missions, new weapons, and fresh enemies to kill or be killed by. I’m also excited about the changes to progression, which will simplify some parts, making it easier to get cool guns and have fun, but will also add more customization options for weapons as players spend more time completing missions.</p>

 <p>“We have taken a lot of feedback to heart,” explained the studio. “Over the summer, we have worked hard on releasing updates to the game. Still, Breakpoint is only the first major step, we know we need a few more<b>,&nbsp;</b>bringing significant improvements and new systems, as well as content, into the game, incorporating community feedback alongside our own ideas.” The team also thanked players for “sticking” around as it essentially redevelops <em>FBC</em> post-launch. I hope it all works out, and I’m excited to hop back in to the new <em>FBC: Firebreak</em> as we enter spooky season.</p>

 <h2><strong><em>Payday 2</em> is getting a subscription service for all its DLC</strong></h2> <p>Did you know that 2013’s<em> Payday 2,</em> a co-op heist shooter, has over 60 pieces of DLC? That’s wild, huh? The game has so much DLC that developer Starbreeze is now offering people a monthly subscription service that grants them access to all of it. The new sub comes in two flavors: $4.99 a month or $19.99 for six months. It’s not a horrible deal, and for new players or folks just wanting to play with friends who might own everything, it’s a fine option.</p>

 <p>But many players aren’t happy that, alongside this subscription launch, the studio has increased the price for a bundle that includes all the DLC. Previously, buying all the DLC cost around $135. Now it’s marked up to $170. Yikes! <a href="https://www.pcgamesn.com/payday-2/subscription-service">Starbreeze tells <em>PCGamesn</em></a> that the price increase is “completely unrelated” to the subscription service. Sure! Regardless, it’s left a bad taste in many mouths and is likely to make folks assume the new sub is just a way to squeeze more money out of folks not willing to pay $170+ for all the DLC.</p>

 <h2><strong>Nintendo just released a new <em>Fire Emblem</em> game, but…</strong></h2> <p><a href="https://www.nintendo.co.jp/corporate/release/en/2025/250925.html">So a new<em> Fire Emblem</em> game was shadow-dropped overnight on September 24.</a> That should be exciting. However, people who have downloaded and played <em>Fire Emblem Shadows</em> have discovered it’s a not-so-great <em>Among Us</em>-like free-to-play social deduction game. That’s not what a lot of<em> Fire Emblem</em> fans wanted, and <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/marioprime.bsky.social/post/3lzmpnsogls2i">early impressions are bad</a>, with some people reporting that the game feels extremely underbaked and barebones. But don’t worry, there’s a battle pass and plenty of ways to spend money.</p>

 <h2><strong><em>MGS Delta’</em>s multiplayer mode is launching next month</strong></h2> <p>On September 25, as part of Tokyo Games Show, <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/metal-gear-solid-delta-snake-eater-online-multiplayer-mode-fox-hunt-has-a-release-date-fresh-update-out-now">Konami announced</a> that the multiplayer mode for its recently released <em>MGS3</em> remake will launch on October 30. It will be part of a bigger free update arriving for <em>Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater</em> next month.</p> <p data-cy="paragraph">The cat-and-mouse online PVP stealth mode will support up to 12 players across all platforms and is arriving about two months after<em> MGS Delta: Snake Eater</em> launched to mostly positive reviews. It doesn’t seem anything like my beloved <em>Metal Gear Solid Online,</em> but it could be fun, I guess.</p> <h2><strong><em>Call of Duty: Black Ops 7</em>‘s beta will include Zombies content</strong></h2>  <p>For the first time in the franchise’s long history, <a href="https://www.callofduty.com/blog/2025/09/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-zombies-deep-dive">the next <em>Call of Duty</em> game’s beta will include some Zombies content</a>. Players will be able to check out a small survival map and mode in the upcoming October beta, as well as standard multiplayer action, too. <a href="https://www.callofduty.com/blog/2025/09/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-multiplayer-deep-dive">The beta starts on October 2 on all platforms.&nbsp;</a></p> <h2>ICYMI:</h2> <ul> <li><a href="https://kotaku.com/state-of-play-playstation-5-sony-stream-youtube-twitch-2000628258">Here’s everything Sony showed off at yesterday’s State of Play</a></li> <li><a href="https://kotaku.com/hades-ii-the-kotaku-review-2000628064">Read our <em>Hades 2</em> review</a></li> <li><a href="https://kotaku.com/call-of-duty-last-gen-player-count-ps4-not-holding-black-ops-7-back-2000628253"><em>Call of Duty</em> devs say last-gen isn’t holding the series back</a></li> </ul> <h2>Watch This</h2>
