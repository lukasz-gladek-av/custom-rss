              <p><span>Yesterday brought us the inaugural New Game+ Showcase, in which multiple content creators decided to cut out the Kojima-glazing middleman and just show off a crapload of games. While the event ended up getting ridiculed a lot for feeling more like a podcast than a showcase, it did include interesting new glimpses of a number of upcoming games, including what claims to to be one of the largest open-world RPGs of 2026. </span></p> <p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MA7AZs4Gn_o"><i><span>Crimson Desert</span></i></a>,<span> the sprawling action-adventure with the </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/crimson-desert-pearl-abyss-horse-drift-black-desert-onl-1850763397"><span>racecar-like horses</span></a><span> from </span><i><span>Black Desert Online</span></i><span> developers Pearl Abyss, is set to launch on March 19. PR rep Will Powers was asked during </span><a href="https://www.youtube.com/@newgameshowcase"><span>New Game+</span></a><span> about the actual size of the game world, after some of the initial previews gave the impression that the game’s pretty massive vistas were “just a tiny corner of the map.” Powers then gave an eye-popping answer:&nbsp;</span></p>

 <blockquote><p><span>Twice the playable area of <em>Skyrim</em>. It’s larger than the map of <em>Red Dead Redemption 2</em>. The area that you’re playing in, the continent of Pywel is absolutely massive.</span></p></blockquote> <p><span>In fairness to Pearl Abyss, that’s not a terribly out-of-pocket thing for a developer largely known for </span><a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/black-desert-online-has-made-usd1-7bn-in-revenue-to-date"><span>an enormously popular freemium MMORPG</span></a><span> to say, especially given how much of </span><i><span>Crimson Desert</span></i><span> looks like an MMORPG that eventually had a single-player action game grafted into it (</span><a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/crimson-desert-release-date-trailer-online-gameplay/"><span>which is what actually happened</span></a><span>). But still, that’s a lot of game. Or at least a lot of game map.</span></p>

 <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">Crimson Desert claims to have twice the playable area as Skyrim and a map larger than Red Dead Redemption 2 <a href="https://t.co/iCtLZ7IWU4">pic.twitter.com/iCtLZ7IWU4</a></p> <p>— Jake Lucky (@JakeSucky) <a href="https://twitter.com/JakeSucky/status/2009694157896663175?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 9, 2026</a></p></blockquote>  <p><span>The footage shared thus far </span><a href="https://youtu.be/1ItNYP9U1M0"><span>in trailers and previews</span></a><span> does show a pretty world and some solid combat, and look, I will always give brownie points to any game that lets you ride a dragon. But what about the possibility that it will be a lot of space with no real purpose? Powers himself tries to cut off that concern at the pass. </span><i><span>“</span></i><span>Size doesn’t really matter if there’s nothing to do,</span><i><span>” he said “</span></i><span>Open-world games are about doing things, having activities, having distractions, so we wanted to create a world that’s not only massive but incredibly interactive</span><i><span>.”</span></i><span>&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><span>To her credit, streamer Luality chimed in fairly often during the interview trying to press Powers on what kinds of interactions the player can look forward to in this giant world, asking if you can fight dragons or romance NPCs. The best Powers came up with in response was emphasizing </span><i><span>“</span></i><span>all sorts of deep crafting systems.”</span></p>

 <p><span>Therein lies the real issue with making promises about map size in the year of our Lord 2026: it’s long since become a useless metric. Having a game world the size of Australia is all well and good, you can even have it be full of </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/starfield-game-pass-release-date-no-man-s-sky-bethesda-1849053885"><span>empty space to traverse</span></a><span>. But you have to do more with empty space than just fill it with crafting supplies. That’s a legitimate reason to praise games that actually make their terrain meaningful, like Kojima’s </span><i><span>Death Stranding 2</span></i><span>, and a reason to put on your skeptic glasses whenever anyone starts hyping up the size of their map rather than what’s in it. </span></p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/gamestop-ceo-stores-closing-payout-ryan-cohen-2000658532</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><span>GameStop has been in hot water for some time now. </span><span>But the company’s CEO, Ryan Cohen, should come away relatively unscathed</span><span>, because, thanks to</span> <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2026/01/07/business/gamestop-ceo-ryan-cohen-compensation-package"><span>CNN</span><span>,</span></a> <span>we now know he will score a $35 billion payout if the storefront hits a $100 billion market cap. One small issue: that’s about 10 times its current value.</span></p> <p><span>How is Cohen planning on getting it there? Thanks to a</span><a href="https://www.polygon.com/gamestop-closing-stores-as-ceo-payday/"> <i><span>Polygon</span></i><span> report</span></a><span>, we know that he intends to close hundreds of stores and to offer customers a 20 percent trade-in bonus via a QR code. Although we don’t have concrete numbers on exactly how many stores have been shut down, a</span><a href="https://gsclosing.blogspot.com/2025/12/january-2026-reported-closings.html"> <span>post on a blog</span></a><span> that tracks GameStop closures</span><span> reports that close to 400 stores have either already been closed this month or are set to be closed before the month is over.</span></p>

 <p><span>The trade coupon, meanwhile, was shared on the </span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GameStop/comments/1q2h1j2/gamestop_really_put_a_trade_coupon_on_my_local/"><span>official GameStop Reddit</span></a><span> page by a user who posted their frustration about the closure of their local store, saying “GameStop really put a trade coupon on my local stores closing sign?” In that same thread, the </span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GameStop/comments/1q2h1j2/comment/nxhrn13/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button"><span>original poster voiced their frustrations by calling it</span></a><span> “a fucking joke,” while others stated that they have begun canceling pre-orders.</span></p>

 <p><span>It’s also worth noting that GameStop closed 590 stores in 2024, according to a</span><a href="https://www.sec.gov/ix?doc=/Archives/edgar/data/0001326380/000132638025000098/gme-20251101.htm"> <span>December 2025 SEC filing</span></a><span>. The filing goes on to state that the company plans on “closing a significant number of additional stores in fiscal 2025.” This is important because the 2025 fiscal year ends on January 31, 2026, which means more stores could close sooner rather than later. GameStop has also been closing stories across various countries worldwide. The same SEC Filing states that the company has already “exited” operations in Austria, Ireland, and Switzerland. In 2024, it also closed down store operations in Germany while selling off its Italian subsidiary.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><span>Even as it shuts down stores en masse, GameStop has been doing everything it can to get attention back on the storefront over the last few months, partnering with popular influencers such as Casey Neistat and Mega64, and even with</span><a href="https://www.instagram.com/reels/DSIjPqvACxN/"> <span>Rilie Huntley</span></a><span>, a popular e-girl who originally went viral over a Best Buy ad. Just recently, the company had a </span><span>“</span><a href="https://kotaku.com/tag/gamestop"><span>trade anything day</span></a><span>“</span><span> which saw people bringing in all sorts of things, including sex toys. Just a few days earlier, the</span><a href="https://kotaku.com/gamestop-power-pack-pokemon-tcg-trade-in-gengar-2000649582"> <span>GameStop card loot program led to a record-breaking $30,000 trade-in</span></a><span>.</span></p>
