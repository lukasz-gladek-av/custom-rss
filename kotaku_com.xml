            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>The recent<a href="https://kotaku.com/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-bad-bf6-battlefield-6-hype-trailer-2000618912"><em> Battlefield 6</em></a> open beta was a massive success for EA and Battlefield Studios, amassing over half a million concurrent players on Steam. But some players weren’t happy about how fast and jumpy movement could be in the <a href="https://kotaku.com/battlefield-6-preview-destruction-classes-bf3-bf4-1851787384">online FPS</a>, and others felt the shotgun was too powerful. Now EA has announced that hopping around with a shotty won’t be as effective in the full game.</p> <p><a href="https://x.com/BattlefieldComm/status/1958544678409642329">On August 21, EA and Battlefield Studios published a lengthy community update</a> on Twitter going over what was learned from the beta and what will be changed when the full game launches in October. The big news for many will be that, yes, <a href="https://www.polygon.com/battlefield-6-beta-call-of-duty-ttk/">the devs working on <em>BF6</em> saw some of those wild videos</a> of players hopping, sliding, and diving around in matches <a href="https://kotaku.com/modern-warfare-2-movement-exploit-warzone-2-1849810446">like it’s a modern<em> Call of Duty</em> game</a> and have plans to nerf how fast you slide and how often you can jump.</p> <p>“Movement mechanics have been adjusted to create a more balanced and traditional <em>Battlefield</em> experience,” said EA in the community update post.&nbsp; “Momentum, especially horizontal speed, carried from a slide into a jump has been reduced. There is now a greater penalty for consecutive jumps, which lowers jump height when jumps are spammed. Firing while jumping or sliding will result in increased inaccuracy.”</p>

 <p>According to the devs, the idea behind these changes is to make jumping and sliding “more situational” and less useful during gunfights, with EA adding that it wants to reward “skillful movement” but doesn’t want gameplay to become “too fast or unpredictable.”</p> <h2>The shotgun in <em>Battlefield 6</em> is being nerfed</h2> <p>Another complaint out of the <em>Battlefield 6</em> open beta was that the shotgun carried by assault class players was too powerful. As someone who loved using the shotgun, I disagree entirely and think people need to shut up. But the data does show that the shotgun was very effective at killing people. Maybe too effective? EA thinks so and is nerfing it a bit, explaining: “The M87A1 shotgun now requires more pellets to secure a kill.” So it will still be good up close, but won’t be the powerhouse at medium range like it was in the beta.</p> <figure id="attachment_2000619192" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000619192"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000619192">©EA</figcaption></figure> <p>Other weapon tweaks include a “general pass on recoil” and tap-firing across all weapons. EA wants to emphasize each gun’s “unique feel” and make sure weapons have more varied effective ranges.&nbsp; “We’ve also made changes to encourage more controlled tap-firing and burst-firing, rewarding precision and weapon mastery,” said the team.</p>

 <p>And EA is “investigating the Time-to-Kill and Time-to-Death experiences” in <em>BF6</em>, but doesn’t have any “definitive” plans yet. Personally, I think people were being weird about time-to-kill in <em>BF6</em>‘s beta, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Battlefield/comments/1mltikj/bf6_vs_bf4_ttk_and_sprint_speed/">as it is about the same as it was in <em>BF4</em>.</a> But I do agree that sometimes you’d die instantly, and it felt like only one shot. I assume this is down to some network issues that need to be fixed.</p> <h2>Player counts, Rush changes, and more</h2> <p>Elsewhere in the community update, Battlefield Studios talked more about player counts and how they work in <em>BF6</em>. The devs say the number of players in a match isn’t strictly dictated by the mode, but the scale of the map. For example, at launch, some Breakthrough maps will support 48 players, while others will support 64 players. It’s an interesting strategy that lets the devs use every map for every mode, even if it means upping or lowering the maximum number of players that can get in on the action.</p>

 <p>EA also talked about Rush and how the more players you add to the mode, the harder it becomes for one side to win. So, based on player feedback from the beta, EA is lowering the default number of players in Rush in the full game in October to give attackers a better chance of winning. Hopefully, the studio also changes where players spawn and how close the objectives are in Rush to help make <a href="https://kotaku.com/battlefield-6-open-beta-bf6-rush-mcom-change-wnba-mafia-news-2000618000">matches more fun and less of a slog</a>.</p> <p>Oh, and for players who are part of BF Labs, you’ll get a chance to test out some of the bigger maps coming to <em>BF6</em> at launch, including the remake of<em> BF3</em>‘s beloved Operation Firestorm. EA confirmed that these two maps will “include the full complement of vehicles…along with a more vast combat space.” So you can stop yelling at EA and <em>Battlefield 6</em> devs about bigger maps. They’ve told you before and now have explained again: <a href="https://kotaku.com/battlefield-6-bigger-maps-leak-datamine-eastwood-mirak-ea-bf-labs-2000618202">Bigger maps will be in the full game</a>. Relax, okay?</p> <p><em>Battlefield 6</em> launches on October 10 across PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><i><span>Overwatch 2</span></i><span>’s next season is bringing a </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/overwatch-2-wuyang-trial-trailer-story-gameplay-voice-2000616929"><span>water-bending hero</span></a><span>, some major overhauls to its </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/overwatch-2-perks-stadium-season-15-spotlight-preview-1851761919"><span>build-based Stadium mode</span></a><span>, and new Perks for every character on the roster. I’m not here to talk about all that. I’m here to talk about the collaboration I could not have fathomed that was teased at the very end of the hero shooter’s latest trailer. Blizzard and Atlus have worked out a deal to put skins based on </span><i><span>Persona </span></i><span>characters in the hero shooter. What a world we live in.</span></p> <p><span>I do not care for </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/overwatch-2-street-fighter-skin-collaboration-crossover-1851779908"><span>the </span><i><span>Fortnite</span></i><span>-ification of </span><i><span>Overwatch 2</span></i></a><span>, which has</span> <a href="https://kotaku.com/overwatch-2-collaborations-survey-pokemon-star-wars-1851787277"><span>become such a core part of Blizzard’s strategy</span></a><span> these days, so even though </span><i><span>Persona </span></i><span>is one of my favorite video game series of all time, I’m not particularly thrilled that this collaboration is happening. That said, I am morbidly curious as to what this collaboration ends up looking like. The brief clip at the end of the trailer shows someone dressed as Joker, the main character of </span><i><span>Persona 5</span></i><span>, but we only see them depicted as a silhouette, so it’s unclear who is beneath the mask. Could it be Wuyang, the new support hero joining the roster this season? That doesn’t seem like that much of a stretch. Beyond the mysterious Joker skin, we don’t know if this is strictly a </span><i><span>Persona 5 </span></i><span>collaboration or if we’ll see skins based on characters from other games like </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/persona-3-reload-remake-review-ps5-steam-pc-xbox-1851201927"><i><span>Persona 3</span></i></a> <span>and </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/persona-4-golden-pc-is-the-definitive-edition-of-a-damn-1844024943"><i><span>4</span></i></a><span>. Blizzard could throw a real curveball in there and have cosmetics based on characters from the </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/first-two-persona-games-exist-atlus-admits-1847283391"><span>often-forgotten first two games</span></a><span>. The teaser does include what seems to be a new Play of the Game animation made to look like Joker’s All-Out Attack victory pose, so it looks like we’ll get more than just skins during the event.</span></p> <p><iframe loading="lazy" title="Season 18: Stadium Quick Play Official Trailer | Overwatch 2" width="500" height="281" src="about:blank" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen="" data-rocket-lazyload="fitvidscompatible" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/r2nwpbXoDdY?feature=oembed"></iframe></p> <p><span>Beyond turning Overwatch into Phantom Thieves, </span><i><span>Overwatch 2</span></i><span>’s season 18 is adding new modes and characters to Stadium, as well as allowing you to play it in Quickplay rather than just in ranked modes. This way, you won’t have to worry about losing your rank if you have a bad match or two. Stadium is already one of the biggest time sinks in </span><i><span>Overwatch 2</span></i><span> and going through an entire game just to lose your rank feels bad, so this is a good alternative. In the main game, every hero is getting at least one new ability-altering Perk they can choose between over the course of a match. Some will be getting more than one new Perk, however, as Blizzard plans to rework more than 50 across all characters.</span></p> <p><span>Lastly, Blizzard released a new animated trailer for Wuyang that gives us more insight into his family dynamics and also might tease that his sister, the fire-wielding Anran, may join the roster at some point down the line.</span></p> <p><iframe loading="lazy" title="Elemental Kin | Wuyang Hero Trailer | Overwatch 2" width="500" height="281" src="about:blank" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen="" data-rocket-lazyload="fitvidscompatible" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ytZnOGwEq9s?feature=oembed"></iframe></p> <p><span>Season 18 begins on August 26.</span></p>

They draw, yell, and celebrate.</span></p> <p><span>So far, the most prominent reaction to the </span><i><span>Silksong </span></i><span>news beyond keyboard smashing is art that represents the end of a meme.
