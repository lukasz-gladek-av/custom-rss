One of these free games was <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/lego-fortnite-free-minecraft-review-epic-games-1851140950&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/lego-fortnite-free-minecraft-review-epic-games-1851140950"><em>Lego Fortnite</em>, a <em>Minecraft</em>-like co-op survival sandbox</a></span> that became one of the most popular non-battle-royale games in <em>Fortnite</em>. Now, about 12 months later, Epic is adding a whole new Lego-themed game to <em>Fortnite </em>that looks to be directly inspired by <em>The Sims </em>and <em>GTA </em>roleplay servers. </p><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.fortnite.com/news/lego-fortnite-brick-life-build-your-life-in-the-big-city?sessionInvalidated=true&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.fortnite.com/news/lego-fortnite-brick-life-build-your-life-in-the-big-city?sessionInvalidated=true" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">On December 9, Epic announced that<em> Lego Brick Life</em></a></span><em> </em>will be released on December 12 as a free game in <em>Fortnite</em>. It will be available on Xbox, PlayStation, PC, and Switch in all countries where <em>Fortnite </em>is available, with the exception of South Korea. </p><p>Here’s the first gameplay trailer for <em>Brick Life</em>: </p><p>In <em>Brick Life</em>, you’ll be able to work various jobs to earn money that you can spend on buying a house, decorations, clothes, and more. Players will be able to hang out with friends and use text chat to communicate while living in a bricky new city filled with things to do and a day-night cycle. The game will support drivable vehicles and hoverboards, too.</p><p>And if you think I’m just doing the video game blogger thing of sticking <em>GTA </em>in a headline to get more clicks, look at this tweet from Epic’s official <em>Lego Fortnite</em> Twitter account. It’s clearly referencing a certain famous <em>GTA: San Andreas </em>meme and <em>GTA</em> <em>6</em>'s now-famous artwork. </p><p>Yeah, Epic is definitely targeting teens and kids who love <em>GTA </em>roleplay servers and the <em>Grand Theft Auto</em> series with this new game mode. And that makes sense. Roleplay servers in <em>Roblox</em>, <em>Fortnite</em>, and<em> GTA V </em>are incredibly popular. The kids love to live out the fantasy of having a stable job and owning a home in a world where you don’t have to worry about healthcare costs. </p><p><em>Brick Life</em> launches on December 12 in <em>Fortnite</em>. Meanwhile, the original<em> Lego Fortnite</em> mode is being rebranded, expanded, and improved, too. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.fortnite.com/news/lego-fortnite-becomes-lego-fortnite-odyssey-with-the-storm-chasers-update&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.fortnite.com/news/lego-fortnite-becomes-lego-fortnite-odyssey-with-the-storm-chasers-update" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">You can read more about those changes here</a></span>. </p><p> .<br></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

It seems like some people might be gravitating to whatever broken build they can find currently popping off online in part because they’re struggling with the early game in a way they didn’t in <em>Path of Exile 1</em> or similar games like <em>Diablo IV</em>. </p><p>This exploratory phase is part of the fun of diving into a big new action-RPG though. <em>Path of Exile </em>is a game all about deep character customization that lets players experiment with all sorts of builds until they find something that really suits their playstyle or overperforms in unexpected ways. It’s still the earliest days for <em>Path of Exile 2</em>, which came out in preview mode on PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X/S on December 6 alongside its Steam Early Access release (the game is currently $30 but will be free-to-play at its 1.0 launch). </p><p>And dealing with unexpected difficulty curves or build nerfs is better than battling down servers or long queue times. “For those still in queue, what we are doing right now is letting in players in batches so that we can make sure to monitor the backend and not overload it,” the studio <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://x.com/pathofexile/status/1865156788636848490&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://x.com/pathofexile/status/1865156788636848490" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">revealed</a></span> late on Friday. “Thanks once again for your patience and hopefully it won’t be too much longer.” </p><p>Things seem to have improved as of Monday. The concurrent player count recently dipped to 330,000 on PC, down from its weekend peak of 578,562. The record launch came despite equally big debuts last weekend from the likes of <em>Marvel Rivals </em>and <em>Infinity Nikki</em>.
