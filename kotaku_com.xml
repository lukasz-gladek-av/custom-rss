            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>A strange rumor that popped up online last month claimed that, to avoid early leaks, Rockstar Games and Take-Two Interactive were going to delay the physical release of <em>Grand Theft Auto 6 </em>and the game would only launch digitally. That’s not the case.</p> <p>On February 3, as part of Take-Two’s Q3 fiscal results, the company’s longtime CEO Strauss Zelnick <a href="https://variety.com/2026/gaming/news/borderlands-4-switch-release-paused-take-two-ceo-gta-online-1236651227/">told <em>Variety</em></a> bluntly that the online rumors swirling around <em>GTA 6</em>‘s physical launch were nothing to worry about.</p> <p>“That’s not the plan,” Zelnick told the outlet.</p> <p><a href="https://www.ppe.pl/news/397290/gta-6-a-wersja-pudelkowa-sprzedawcy-zwiastuja-smutna-wiadomosc-dla-fanow-fizycznych-wydan.html">This odd rumor popped up in January</a> after a Polish site reported that a Rockstar insider had heard that <em>GTA 6′</em>s physical and digital releases could be split up. Once the rumor popped up in January, it quickly spread and was reported by sites like <a href="https://www.dexerto.com/gta/gta-6s-physical-release-could-be-delayed-to-2027-because-of-leaks-3309757/"><em>Dexerto</em></a> and was posted across places like Reddit, Twitter, YouTube, and Facebook. Here is the original, now debunked, claim:</p>

 <blockquote><p>“We are getting more and more information that the box version will not be released simultaneously with the digital version to prevent leaks.”</p></blockquote> <p>However, <em>Kotaku</em> was unable to verify the rumor with any of its sources. And to be honest, it always seemed odd, especially when you consider digital games have leaked via pre-loads. In fact, that happened with <a href="https://gamefaqs.gamespot.com/boards/634490-grand-theft-auto-v/67072105"><em>GTA V</em> over a decade ago</a>. And now that Zelnick has weighed in officially to call the rumor false, hopefully that’s the end of it. Now, <em><a href="https://kotaku.com/gta-6-trailer-breakdown-secrets-spf-sunscreen-reddit-1851144759">GTA</a></em> fans can go back to figuring out the SPF rating of an NPC’s sunscreen via wild math and trailer screenshots.</p> <p><em>Grand Theft Auto 6</em> launches November 19 for PS5 and Xbox Series X/S. <a href="https://kotaku.com/gta-6-still-confirmed-for-november-with-summer-marketing-blitz-planned-2000665452">Take-Two has confirmed that marketing for the game will begin sometime in the summer</a>.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/borderlands-4-switch-2-release-date-canceled-2000665470</link>
            <guid>1424674</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/borderlands-4-the-kotaku-review-bugs-pc-performance-ending-gearbox-ps5-2000627149"><em>Borderlands 4</em></a> was supposed to be one of the Nintendo Switch 2’s big fall 2025 releases but was indefinitely delayed amid a race to address performance issues for the PC version. Many fans hoped it might end up launching in early 2026 instead, but the Switch 2 port of <em>Borderlands 4</em> is now officially being paused.</p> <p>“We made the difficult decision to pause development on that SKU,” Take-Two spokesperson Alan Lewis <a href="https://variety.com/2026/gaming/news/borderlands-4-switch-release-paused-take-two-ceo-gta-online-1236651227/">told&nbsp;<em>Variety </em></a>on Thursday. “Our focus continues to be delivering quality post-launch content for players on the ongoing improvements to optimize the game. We’re continuing to collaborate closely with our friends at Nintendo. We have <em>PGA Tour 2K25</em> coming out and <em>WWE 2K26</em> [for Switch 2], and we’re incredibly excited about bringing more of our titles to that platform in the future.”</p>

 <p>What’s especially odd about the last-minute reversal is that<em> Borderlands 4</em> was already publicly demoed running on Switch 2 last summer at shows like PAX West. Assessments varied, with some players saying it looked surprisingly good while <a href="https://twitter.com/EpicNNG/status/1958920625600569844?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1958920625600569844%7Ctwgr%5Ef902f1abb49199769f6600e5bad50cb760a1d61f%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.thegamer.com%2Fborderlands-4-performance-issues-nintendo-switch-2%2F">others said</a> it suffered from surprising performance hang-ups, even when docked.</p> <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">Okay I’ll just put it bluntly:</p> <p>Borderlands 4 on the Switch 2 could barely run at 30fps with 4 enemies on screen in docked mode. It had horrendous input delay, and the render resolution was seemingly turned all the way down.</p> <p>I’ll talk more about it in a video maybe tomorrow 😬</p> <p>— EpicNNG (@EpicNNG) <a href="https://twitter.com/EpicNNG/status/1958920625600569844?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">August 22, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <p>“We need to share that the release of<em>&nbsp;Borderlands 4</em> on Nintendo Switch 2 is being delayed,” the studio wrote <a href="https://kotaku.com/borderlands-4-switch-2-delay-cross-save-performance-2000628055">in a surprise announcement</a> last September less than two weeks before it was set to launch. “We do not take this decision lightly, but are committed to ensuring we deliver the best possible experience to our fans, and the game needs additional development and polish time to do that.”</p>

 <p>Gearbox Entertainment recently <a href="https://kotaku.com/borderlands-4-2026-road-map-updates-cross-save-new-loot-dlc-level-cap-increase-2000664254">doubled down on big plans for the looter shooter’s 2026 content roadmap</a>. That includes a new rarity of gear, raising the level cap, and fresh story content in paid DLC packs. The roadmap even called out the addition of a new photo mode. The Switch 2 port, on the other hand, was conspicuously absent. Publisher 2K Games has yet to reveal how many copies the latest sequel has sold.</p>

 <p><em>Borderlands 4</em>‘s absence from the Switch 2 will be a bummer for fans hoping they’d eventually be able to jump in, but it’s not the only port that players have been patiently waiting on. <em>Elden Ring</em> was also announced for Nintendo’s new console last year and also remains MIA. Demos last summer suggested it was having framerate issues as well. Other heavy hitters like <em>Assassin’s Creed Shadows</em> and <em>Final Fantasy VII Remake Intergrade</em> have performed well enough though.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><span>In 2015, </span><i><span>Gawker </span></i><span>published an article titled “</span><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150124104133/https://gawker.com/here-is-pedophile-billionaire-jeffrey-epsteins-little-b-1681383992"><span>Here Is Pedophile Billionaire Jeffrey Epstein’s Little Black Book</span></a><span>.” It included a link to a redacted copy of Epstein’s alleged address book listing contact info for a range of famous, wealthy, and powerful people. One of them was <a href="https://kotaku.com/activision-blizzard-ceo-bobby-kotick-halves-pay-still-1846789618">then-Activision-Blizzard-CEO Bobby Kotick</a> who ran the publisher behind industry-defining hits like<em> Call of Duty</em> and <em>World of Warcraft</em>. The latest trove of Epstein files released by the Justice Department last week shows more than a dozen emails allegedly exchanged between the two men.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>Several emails dating from November 2012 show Epstein trying to set up an alleged dinner with Kotick while the latter was visiting New York. Epstein had asked the gaming executive if he’d be willing to come a day early when the actor and director Woody Allen would be available, but one of the emails shows Kotick writing back to say that wasn’t possible.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>Epstein’s itinerary for that month listed a dinner with Bobby Kotick on November 18, 2012. “bobby Kotick came over last night„ hes great,” Epstein wrote to Next Model Management co-founder Faith Kates on November 19, 2012. Kates unexpectedly retired last month after her name surfaced </span><a href="https://pagesix.com/2025/12/01/society/next-model-management-co-founder-faith-kates-retires-after-jeffrey-epstein-e-mails-resurface/"><span>in a previously reported</span></a><span> batch of Epstein emails.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>A representative for Epstein proceeded to send information about his private island in the Caribbean, Little St. James, to Kotick on November 21, 2012. In a follow-up exchange on December 9, 2012, Epstein asked Kotick how the Caribbean was. Kotick allegedly wrote back, “Great, wished would could have stopped by the island.”</span></p> <p><span>Emails between the two were allegedly exchanged multiple times in 2013 as well. A February 24, 2013 email stated that Epstein was in LA planning a visit to SpaceX that week and was trying to link up with Kotick while in town. “Thanks , but rather see you,” Epstein wrote in one email. “Taking girls after to bel air.” Kotick at one point allegedly wrote back, “Come with your friends to my house at…Bev Hills, 10 min=tes from Bel Air.”</span></p> <p><span>Several emails also show Epstein trying to arrange a tour of Activision. The company did not respond to a request for comment.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>Epstein again tried to arrange a meeting with Kotick at the end of April 2013. “great… see you then i will bring 3or 4 . also I understand that Brian Grazer, like me ,searches for smart interesting people„ do you know him?” Epstein emailed Kotick on April 29, 2013. “Yes I do,” Kotick allegedly wrote back. A follow-up email from Kotick was allegedly sent later that day. “Can we meet at 6? I am running late,” it read.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>The two allegedly exchanged more emails the following day. “great house, great art, i am in ny 1-6 if you have time when you come,” Epstein wrote to Kotick on April 30, 2012. “Thanks. Great guests,” Kotick allegedly wrote back. The email accounts corresponded multiple times in the days after that. “my russian guest misssed your arrival yesterday,” Epstein wrote to Kotick in a May 7, 2012 email. “And I missed her. III see you both next trip,” Kotick allegedly wrote back on May 8, 2012.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>Each of these emails is dated after Epstein’s 2008 felony conviction in Florida where he pled guilty to state charges of soliciting and procuring a person under 18 for prostitution. He went on to serve a 13-month jail sentence and was added to the national sex offender registry, for which an account belonging to him was later banned from Xbox Live in December 2013.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>Kotick allegedly exchanged emails with Epstein associate Ghislaine Maxwell as well. “You don’t ring, you don’t write. Yours heart broken Ghislain,” Maxwell wrote to Kotick in April 24, 2004. An email reply allegedly from Kotick read, “Mend it together and bring that sexy body that goes with it out to my town. III ring.”&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>Maxwell was sentenced to 20 years in prison in 2022 for what the </span><a href="https://www.justice.gov/usao-sdny/pr/ghislaine-maxwell-sentenced-20-years-prison-conspiring-jeffrey-epstein-sexually-abuse"><span>Justice Department described as</span></a><span> “her role in a scheme to sexually exploit and abuse multiple minor girls with </span><a href="https://www.justice.gov/usao-sdny/pr/jeffrey-epstein-charged-manhattan-federal-court-sex-trafficking-minors"><span>Jeffrey Epstein</span></a><span> over the course of a decade.”</span></p> <p><span>Kotick left Activision Blizzard in December 2023 after the company was acquired by Microsoft in a record $70 billion acquisition. The merger came at the conclusion of a lengthy regulatory process and while Activision Blizzard was facing multiple sexual misconduct lawsuits which were eventually settled with no admission of any wrongdoing.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>“[N]o court or any independent investigation has substantiated any allegations that there has been systemic or widespread sexual harassment at Activision Blizzard; that Activision Blizzard senior executives ignored, condoned, or tolerated a culture of systemic harassment, retaliation, or discrimination; or that Activision Blizzard’s Board of Directors including its Chief Executive Officer, Robert Kotick, acted improperly with regard to the handling of any instances of workplace misconduct,” </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/tiktok-sale-bobby-kotick-1851325000"><span>read a statement</span></a><span> included in one of the court-approved settlements. </span></p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/gta-6-still-confirmed-for-november-with-summer-marketing-blitz-planned-2000665452</link>
            <guid>1424605</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Rockstar’s parent company, Take-Two Interactive, reconfirmed that <em>Grand Theft Auto 6</em> is set to launch this November during its quarterly earnings report and conference. Take-Two’s CEO even revealed that marketing for the long-awaited crime sim will start this summer.</p> <p>On Tuesday, <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/gta-6-marketing-will-kick-off-this-summer-as-take-two-confidently-reaffirms-november-release-date?utm_source=bluesky,threads,twitter">as spotted in a press release about Take-Two’s Q3 2026 earnings results by <em>IGN</em></a>, the company confirmed that it plans to start marketing <em>Grand Theft Auto 6</em> sometime in the summer, which seems to indicate that the game, which has been delayed a few times now, is actually (for real) getting close to launching later this year.</p>

 <p>“I feel good about it. Very good about it,” said Zelnick when asked by the outlet how he felt about <em>GTA 6</em>‘s November 19 release. “Of course, because any time you’re getting closer to marketing beats, you’re obviously in a place where your confidence level is as high as it can be.”</p> <p>Meanwhile, <a href="https://www.thegamebusiness.com/p/take-two-ceo-googles-project-genie">Zelnick told newsletter <em>The Game Business</em></a>&nbsp;this when asked about the confirmation that<em> GTA 6</em>‘s marketing blitz was just a few months away: “You know me pretty well, for me to even say we’ve got marketing beats coming this summer is a huge departure from what I usually say, which is that our labels will make marketing announcements.”</p>

 <p>In an earnings call later in the day, Zelnick was asked how much marketing a game like GTA 6 even needs. He assured investors that Take-Two and Rockstar weren’t going to “sit back and relax.”</p> <p>“I think the opposite is true,” said Zelnick. “We are in the business of eating red meat for breakfast. I think we’ll be having a lot more red meat in the coming months. We are very fortunate that the consumer anticipation for <em>GTA 6</em> is huge. And one does have to be judicious with how one markets such an extraordinary product. Rest assured, I think you’ll be pretty astonished by the creativity that Rockstar’s marketing team brings to consumers in the coming months.”</p>

 <p>Normally, Take-Two doesn’t provide details like this, opting to let Rockstar provide those details later, so this is a good sign that <em>GTA 6</em>‘s development is on track. You don’t start committing to expensive marketing plans and telling the press about them unless everyone involved is very confident in the game’s development status. And yes, <a href="https://kotaku.com/gta-6-release-date-delay-borderlands-4-fall-2025-1851757501">in the past, Zelnick has told investors and the public he felt good about <em>GTA 6</em>‘s release date</a>, and then it was delayed. <a href="https://kotaku.com/gta-6-delay-strauss-zelnick-ceo-take-two-interview-rockstar-games-2000617237">But in those cases</a>, he and Take-Two hadn’t committed to a marketing timeframe like this before. And while things can always change, at least for now it seems <em>GTA 6</em> is finally, for real, actually launching as planned on November 19.</p> <p><b>Update: 2/3/26, 5:35 p.m. ET: </b>Added quote from Zelnick about <em>GTA 6</em> marketing.</p>

              <p><i><span>Fortnite </span></i><span>is an amalgamation of every facet of pop culture, which can sometimes lead to weird moments of whiplash as it veers between awesome crossovers and properties I wouldn’t want to touch with a 10-foot pole. Take, for instance, the battle royale following up its </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/fortnite-harry-potter-skins-leak-jk-rowling-transphobia-2000654659"><i><span>Harry Potter </span></i><span>collaboration</span></a><span>, facilitated by the series’ </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/hogwarts-legacy-review-harry-potter-rowling-transphobia-1850127849"><span>transphobic creator</span></a><span>, with skins of one of the most visible queer artists in the music industry right now. That’s right, Chappell Roan is finally coming to </span><i><span>Fortnite </span></i><span>with several skins and cosmetics, and they look fantastic.&nbsp;</span></p> <figure id="attachment_2000665446" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000665446"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000665446">© Epic Games</figcaption></figure> <p><span>Roan is <a href="https://www.fortnite.com/news/chappell-roan-the-midwest-princess-rides-into-fortnite-festival">headlining the next iteration of </a></span><i><span>Fortnite Festival</span></i><span>, with new and old Jam Tracks like “Good Luck, Babe,” “HOTTOGO,” “The Giver,” and “Pink Pony Club” all either returning to the shop or joining the playlist as part of the Heartcore Music Pass. Buying the pass will get you the pink Chappell Roan skin of the star sporting the iconic “Pink Pony Club” outfit, and there will also be an unlockable red version. There’s also an outfit inspired by her </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/chappell-roan-video-music-awards-vmas-good-luck-babe-1851646872"><span>2024 VMAs fit</span></a><span> called “Roan of Arc,” which has the singer dressed in a suit of armor. Each skin comes with accessories, including special instruments like a keytar, drum set, and mic stand, and the Roan of Arc fit has a special sword and Pink Pony Sidekick.&nbsp;</span></p>

              <p><em>Highguard’s</em> 5v5 mode, which launched over the weekend as a temporary experiment, is now a permanent mode in the free-to-play raid shooter. And while the new mode is better than the old 3v3 option, I’m not sure it’s enough to save this thing.</p> <p>On January 30, after some teasing, <a href="https://kotaku.com/highguard-big-update-free-shooter-future-patch-notes-wildlight-2000664584"><em>Highguard’s</em> devs announced a new 5v5 mode</a> was being added to the game immediately following fan feedback that the original 3v3 mode wasn’t exciting enough. At the time, <em>Highguard</em> labeled the new option as a “limited time mode.” However, apparently so many players liked it, and the reaction to it was so positive, that the mode is going to stick around permanently alongside the 3v3 mode, which isn’t going away.</p>

 <p>“You’ve been asking, and we’re happy to share—5v5 Raid Mode is here to stay,” <a href="https://x.com/PlayHighguard/status/2018459289933787412?s=20">posted <em>Highguard’s</em> official Twitter account.</a> “We appreciate everyone hopping in over the weekend to give the mode a try.

(@PlayHighguard) <a href="https://twitter.com/PlayHighguard/status/2018459289933787412?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">February 2, 2026</a></p></blockquote>  <p>Credit to developers Wildlight Entertainment for implementing a 5v5 mode into <a href="https://kotaku.com/highguards-patch-note-fov-ps5-crash-pc-optimization-2000664201"><em>Highguard</em> </a>so shortly after the game’s January 26 launch. And after playing a few 5v5 matches over the last few days, I do think it’s a better version of the game. In my experience, having more players on the map has led to more frequent firefights before the shieldbreaker fully spawns. It also makes raids bigger and more chaotic. It did cause some performance issues during those fights that involved most or all of the players, something Wildlight warned could be an issue. Hopefully, performance can be improved in 5v5 matches because it’s easily the best way to play <em>Highguard</em> and likely should have been the primary mode the game launched with last month.</p>

 <p>All that said, <a href="https://kotaku.com/highguard-the-kotaku-review-is-it-good-free-ps5-pc-5v5-3v3-update-patch-2000664646">I’m not sitting here suggesting <em>Highguard</em></a> is suddenly a great game now. A lot of <em>Highguard’s</em> issues aren’t solved by adding more players. There are still too many competing mechanics causing issues, the visuals are bland, heroes are dull, combat seems too sweaty for more casual players, and collecting loot isn’t much fun. 5v5 doesn’t change that, even if it does make the game more fun to play.</p>

 <p>I suspect this 5v5 mode will be enough to help <em>Highguard</em> escape <em>Concord’s</em> fate and let it stick around for a few more weeks at least. Beyond that, I’m not sure. I’m not convinced the world needed another online-only team-based PVP hero shooter, even if it now supports 10 players in a match.</p>
