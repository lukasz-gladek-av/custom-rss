            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>The latest YouTube video stunt by one <a href="https://kotaku.com/mrbeast-lawsuit-beast-games-amazon-hidden-cameras-1851775284">James “MrBeast” Donaldson</a> has already wracked up over 46 million views in just one day and it’s not hard to imagine why. Titled “<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zo7i8VTpfNM&amp;t=28s">Would You Risk Dying For $500,000?</a>” it shows a series of challenges in which people brave flame-engulfed obstacles in exchange for money. It’s kind of like David Blaine if, instead of doing absurd and wild stuff himself, he paid other people to do it while also explaining how it was all incredibly fake and just for grim lulz.</p> <p>The infernal trap that’s been drawing the most attention is one in which a stuntman is tied to a chair inside a “burning house” and has to escape and save as much money as he can from inside the house in order to earn the highest cash prize possible. Donaldson bounces back and forth between urgent warnings about how real the flames are and mugging the camera with jokes about MrBeast product placement. The entertainment concept is more grotesquely mundane than anything Phillip K. Dick could have imagined and also, clearly, highly entertaining to millions of people.</p> <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">This blew up, if you’re curious obviously we had ventilation for the smoke and a kill switch to cut off the fires. We had professionals test this extensively and the guy in the video as stated is a professional stunt man. I take safety more serious than you could ever imagine.</p> <p>— MrBeast (@MrBeast) <a href="https://twitter.com/MrBeast/status/1972507399413260366?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">September 29, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <p>Donaldson defended his uniquely gifted intuition for creating the debased content people crave by promising the whole stunt was tested with professionals multiple times, responding to viral posts about the stunt with additional context. The last thing Donaldson needs after lawsuits last year over <a href="https://www.rollingstone.com/culture/culture-features/mrbeast-internal-investigation-findings-sexual-misconduct-1235150941/">alleged safety violations on his Amazon Prime</a> show is people thinking he doesn’t take the premise of potentially roasting another human being alive for less than the median home price after taxes seriously.</p>

 <p>“We had professionals test this extensively and the guy in the video as stated is a professional stunt man,” he wrote on X over the weekend. “I take safety more serious than you could ever imagine.” He expanded on the setup in a comment on the YouTube video as well.</p> <div><blockquote data-bluesky-uri="at://did:plc:on5oeywiqx32fh2zau473wz6/app.bsky.feed.post/3lzy22r723k2w" data-bluesky-cid="bafyreiglqdgk2xfrl3d2mts5fqecakrqwbllpidp6sbsybsdamtbhqirve"> <p lang="en">Content creators tend to think any spectacle is defensible if they can say health and safety concerns have been attended to behind the scenes, but that’s not really it imho. Mr. Beast’s whole thing is that his subjects’ desperation for cash allows him—a wealthier person—to indulge his sadism.</p> <p>— <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/did:plc:on5oeywiqx32fh2zau473wz6?ref_src=embed">southpaw (@nycsouthpaw.bsky.social)</a> <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/did:plc:on5oeywiqx32fh2zau473wz6/post/3lzy22r723k2w?ref_src=embed">2025-09-29T12:45:09.235Z</a></p></blockquote></div>  <p>“In case there’s any concern about the safety of the stuntman contestant, I just wanted to mention that we take safety extremely seriously,” he added. “Every challenge was tested by multiple stuntmen, we have a full rescue team on standby with firefighters, EMTs and divers equipped with an ambulance and fire truck. We also had a pyro team controlling the fires and multiple fire suppression methods on every challenge to ensure we could essentially turn off the fire if there was ever an issue. But our stunt coordinator did an amazing job as always, and none of these systems were ever needed. Just wanted to be transparent with you all since I saw some concern!”</p> <p>This is the Catch-22 at the heart of this entire genre of extremely watchable algorithm-bait. Either the entire thing is so real and authentic that it’s an absolutely monstrous thing for everyone involved to be associated with and signals the utter depravity of modern capitalism, or the stunt is all so fake and performative that none of it matters and you’ve been conned out of 25 minutes of your week just so some guy can hock candy bars.</p> <p>Either way, it kinda sucks!</p>

              <p>Microsoft and Asus’ collaborative handheld Xbox device is arriving on October 16, 2025, with pre-orders available at various outlets right now. And as things go on the internet, eBay listings promising confirmed pre-orders are now <a href="https://www.ebay.com/sch/i.html?_nkw=rog+ally+xbox+x&amp;_sacat=0&amp;_from=R40&amp;_trksid=p2334524.m570.l1313&amp;LH_TitleDesc=0&amp;_odkw=rog+ally+xbox&amp;_osacat=0">going for two to three times the retail price</a> –which is pretty ridiculous when the top-tier model of this handheld is already a thousand bucks.</p> <p><b>Read More:</b> <a href="https://kotaku.com/xbox-handheld-rog-ally-x-price-preorder-2000629161">Xbox’s Handheld Finally Has A Price, And It Costs More Than An Xbox</a></p> <p>The ROG Xbox Ally X is an Xbox-skinned portable PC much like the Steam Deck or Asus’ own non-Xbox-branded “Ally.” These devices have become quite popular in recent years because, well, they’re usually pretty awesome. With the ability to carry around massive storefronts like Steam on the go, and enough horsepower to run graphical powerhouses like <i>Cyberpunk 2077</i>, it’s no wonder Microsoft wanted to get in on the action with a more Xbox-themed offering. The only problem is that the hardware manufacturer and game publisher is asking folks to spend $600 on the basic model, and a full four-digit $1,000 for the top-tier model featuring a more powerful processor. And yet, some eBayers think folks will spend even more than that even though it hasn’t sold out elsewhere. Wild.</p>

 <figure id="attachment_2000629896" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000629896"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000629896">© Screenshot: eBay / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <h2>Who’s buying this thing anyway?</h2> <p>The ROG Xbox Ally X (which is the more powerful of the two models) is <i>technically</i> more powerful than some of its competitors. It features a new AMD Z2E AI Chip. Is it a generational leap? Certainly not enough to prompt Valve to base a Steam Deck successor on it.</p>

 <p><b>Read More:</b> <a href="https://kotaku.com/xbox-series-x-s-price-hike-raise-trump-tariff-microsoft-2000627228">Microsoft Reveals The First $800 Xbox With Another Round Of Price Hikes</a></p> <p>Still, the <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/hardware/handheld-gaming-pcs/the-rog-xbox-ally-x-priced-at-usd1-000-and-available-to-pre-order-in-october-making-it-officially-the-most-expensive-xbox-ever/">improved performance of the Z2E</a> <i>is</i> worth noting, with <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Handhelds/comments/1m8ujhf/at_low_tdps_the_z2_extreme_is_a_generational_leap/">around a 10 to 20-percent performance improvement</a> over TKTK, and sometimes a bit more, under certain circumstances. That improvement, however, comes at a cost, namely about $500 more than what you’d pay for a Steam Deck, and $100 more than Asus’ excellent ROG Ally X, which is not the Xbox-branded one. (No, you’re not dumb, this naming convention is.)</p>

 <p>So, that really just leaves the controller-based Xbox user interface, which reduces the overall processing power Windows takes up and is more gamepad-friendly, and the unique controller grips. And even then, <a href="https://kotaku.com/xbox-rog-ally-x-windows-handheld-app-leak-2000626934">folks have found a way to get the new Xbox game launcher working</a> on regular, non-Xbox-branded Ally portable PCs, and, to be honest, while I haven’t held a ROG Xbox Ally, it’s gonna be hard to compete with the Steam Deck’s excellent ergonomics.</p> <p><b>Read More:</b> <a href="https://kotaku.com/xbox-rog-ally-x-windows-handheld-app-leak-2000626934">The Biggest Reason To Buy The Xbox Ally Handheld Just Leaked</a></p> <p>At $1,000 for the top-tier Xbox handheld, it’s hard to see a compelling reason to upgrade if you already have a Steam Deck, and certainly not if you have a more powerful handheld than that. Who, then, is gonna get suckered into spending twice that for an eBay pre-order? Hopefully not you!</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Good morning. Welcome to a new week. Will it be better than last week? I really hope so! Anyway, today’s Morning Checkpoint, <em>Kotaku’s</em> daily round-up of interesting news and stuff you might care about, features a new and less shiny PS5, <em>Silent Hill f</em> sales data,<em> Borderlands 4</em> DLC news, a content creator retiring, and a cool Daft Punk video.</p> <h2><strong>New PS5 Model Ditches All That Shiny Black Plastic</strong></h2> <p>A new model of the PlayStation 5 has leaked online ahead of an official announcement from Sony, and while it’s not a massive update to the current iteration of the console, it does include one tweak that seems to be making a lot of people happy: The new PS5 doesn’t include shiny black plastic.<a href="https://x.com/Zuby_Tech/status/1972613838953476238"> As reported by Zuby_Tech</a>, new photos and information about the refreshed PS5 show that it features matte black plastic, saving you from having to cover your PS5 in nasty fingerprints every time you dare to move or touch it.</p> <p>Other changes found in this new, updated PS5 console include different-colored USB ports, a smaller SSD, and a new heatsink. The console is also overall a bit lighter now, likely thanks to more stamped metal parts inside. No word on when to expect this new console to hit shelves, but I’d bet it won’t be long, as we are getting close to the holiday season.</p>

 <h2><strong><em>Silent Hill f</em> Outselling <em>Silent Hill 2</em> remake</strong></h2> <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="ja" dir="ltr">『SILENT HILL f』</p> <p>全世界累計出荷本数※が100万本を突破しました。<br>プレイいただいた皆さまありがとうございます。</p> <p>■ゲームはこちら: <a href="https://t.co/msZNoMHzVg">https://t.co/msZNoMHzVg</a></p> <p>※2025年9月26日時点 当社調べ<br>※パッケージ版出荷数とダウンロード版販売数の合計<a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/SILENTHILL?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#SILENTHILL</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/%E3%82%B5%E3%82%A4%E3%83%AC%E3%83%B3%E3%83%88%E3%83%92%E3%83%AB?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#サイレントヒル</a> <a href="https://t.co/P6jl93zhGW">pic.twitter.com/P6jl93zhGW</a></p> <p>— SILENT HILL (@silenthill_jp) <a href="https://twitter.com/silenthill_jp/status/1972577585558433936?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">September 29, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <p>People really like <em>Silent Hill f</em>, Konami’s first original mainline entry in the long-running horror series in over a decade. So I’m not shocked to see it selling so well. According to Konami, <em>Silent Hill f</em> sold a million copies in around 24 hours. <a href="https://www.konami.com/games/corporate/ja/news/topics/20250929/">In a press release announcing the news</a>, the publisher also confirmed that <em>Silent Hill f</em> was selling faster than last year’s <em>Silent Hill 2</em> remake. This is good news for <em>Silent Hill</em> fans who have spent the past decade putting up with a lot of bad news, garbage, and disappointment. Hopefully, this new era of <em>Silent Hill</em> isn’t short-lived.</p>

 <h2><strong>GOG Adds More Classic Games To Its Preservation Program&nbsp;</strong></h2> <p>Classic PC gaming store Good Old Games, aka <a href="https://www.gog.com/en/gog-preservation-program?cjdata=MXxOfDB8WX">GOG, announced recently</a> that over half a dozen more titles were being added to its ongoing preservation program. <a href="https://kotaku.com/gog-games-preservation-program-drm-1851696363">Launched in 2024</a>, the GOG Preservation Program is the store’s long-term plan to keep certain classic PC games playable, updated, and accessible. It’s a great idea and one which, if GOG sticks to it, could be extremely helpful for games that no longer have official publisher or developer support.</p>

 <p>Here’s the latest list of games added to the program, many of which are currently on sale to celebrate the news:</p> <p><em>– Gothic 1</em><br> <em>– Gothic 2</em><br> <em>– Necronomicon: The Dawning of Darkness</em><br> <em>– Mortal Kombat Trilogy</em><br> <em>– Freespace 2</em><br> <em>– XIII Century Gold Edition</em><br> <em>– Stranglehold</em></p>

 <h2><strong>Gearbox Reveals <em>Borderlands</em> <em>4</em>‘s First DLC Character&nbsp;</strong></h2>  <p>Over the weekend during Tokyo Game Show, Gearbox and 2K Games revealed the first playable DLC character coming to<em> Borderlands 4:</em> C4SH, a gambling robot cowboy built around luck and chance. <a href="https://x.com/borderlandshub/status/1972264469280559301">Fan account Borderlands 4 Bulletin shared more information</a> about the new Vault Hunter on social media directly from the Gearbox TGS panel. The studio says that C4SH will have 3 action skills just like the other playable characters and that the character’s skills are “distinctly unpredictable, as they all involve an element of chance.”</p>

 <p>C4SH will be available in Q1 2026 for all players on all platforms who own the Super Deluxe Edition of <em>Borderlands 4,</em> buy the Vault Hunter Pack DLC, or who purchase the game’s first Story Pack when it’s available.</p> <p><strong><em>Skyrim</em> Grandma Shirley Curry Retiring (Again)&nbsp;</strong></p> <p><a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/the-elder-scrolls/almost-90-years-old-skyrim-grandma-shirley-curry-says-shes-retiring-from-the-adventuring-life-im-tired-im-not-having-fun-anymore/">As reported by<em> PC Gamer</em>,</a> Shirley Curry, better known online as the famous <em>Skyrim</em> Grandma, is retiring from content creation. The nearly 90-year-old gamer, who will appear in <em>Elder Scrolls 6</em> when that finally launches, <a href="https://youtu.be/89L4oV-ZKqM">confirmed the news in a new VLOG uploaded to her YouTube channel.</a> She explained that she’s just “bored” with playing <em>Skyrim</em> again and isn’t having a great experience on YouTube anymore, as many of the comments she got were just, according to her, younger kids shouting about how much they loved their video game grandma. She says she wanted more feedback and interesting conversations.</p> <p>“That’s why I’m just going to stop uploading anything to do with <em>Skyrim</em>,” said Curry. “I’m tired, I’m not having fun anymore, probably because of all the little kids on there. I think that’s about all I have to say.”</p> <p>Curry will keep making VLOGS and blogging, but her days with <em>Skyrim</em> are over. Probably. It was just a year ago that Curry actually announced similar plans to retire from <em>Elder Scrolls</em> content, but then came back and even made a video of herself playing the <em>Oblivion Remaster</em>. But based on how she sounds in this new VLOG, I get the feeling she really is done with <em>Skyrim</em>.</p> <h2>ICYMI:</h2> <ul> <li><a href="https://kotaku.com/magic-gathering-mtg-star-trek-marvel-avengers-2026-sets-2000629313"><em>Magic: The Gathering</em> is turning into a giant <em>Fortnite</em>-like mess</a></li> <li><a href="https://kotaku.com/helldivers-2-free-to-play-game-tech-debt-ceo-discord-ps5-pc-fps-performance-2000629256"><em>Helldivers 2</em> was, at one point, planned to be a free-to-play game</a></li> <li><a href="https://kotaku.com/nintendo-direct-america-3ds-satoru-shibata-2000629269">Nintendo of America’s New CEO Seems Fun</a></li> </ul> <h2>Watch This:</h2>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>When we look back on 2025, we might remember it as the Year of the Mini PC. These mighty mites broke out in a huge way this year, with powerful and fast new models flooding the market and putting to rest the idea that the mini PC is no more than an amusing toy. Virtually all of these new-breed mini PCs have pushed the productivity and work angle as their selling point, but now the BOSGAME P3 Mini Gaming PC has arrived, combining serious processing and graphics power essential for PC gaming with the ultra-compact body that has made the mini PC such a hot item.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4366/">There’s a limited-time 27% off deal on the BOSGAME P3 at Amazon right now which gives you the chance to shrink your gaming rig smaller than you ever thought possible, and do it for just $400.</a> With the P3 running the show, your gaming station can now fit three massive 4K gaming monitors and your specialized keyboard, mouse, and controller while the PC at the heart of the system is tucked behind one of those monitors, delivering top-level performance while remaining unseen.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4366/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Gaming PC, Not a Toy</h2>
<p>The old-school thought that these fun-sized desktop PCs are mere curiosities and toys that could never possibly compete with a full-sized rig is just that — old school. Beneath its teeny hood the P3 packs an 8-core AMD Ryzen 7 processor with a top speed of 5.1GHz, more than enough to keep you in the game even during a fast-action first-person shooter or battle royal game.</p>
<p>There’s also 32GB of RAM built in, along with a fat 1TB NVMe PCIe 4.0 SSD. And while you certainly would not guess it from looking at this palm-sized PC, you can expand that RAM to 64GB, and there’s even a vacant NVMe PCIe slot available for you to max out the storage.</p>



<h2>Fast, Smooth Graphics</h2>
<p>And, yes, we did say three huge 4K gaming monitors, because the P3 can support them all with HDMI, DisplayPort, and USB-C ports at the ready. The AMD Radeon 780M graphics chip is able to keep up with the fastest and most visually detailed games without lag or glitching. And whether you go with the Wi-Fi6E connection, the Bluetooth 5.2 one, or either of the two Gigabit Ethernet RJ45 ports for hardwired online gaming, you will never be lacking in speed.</p>
<p>It was only a matter of time before a mini PC for gamers hit the market, and when you look at the prices of those enormous rigs with the fancy neon lighting and clear panels showing the guts of the machine, <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4366/">you’ll really be blown away by the $400 price tag on the BOSGAME P3 Mini Gaming PC that you’ll find right now at Amazon.</a> But, it’s only there for a limited time, so be as fast as the P3’s impressive processing and internet speed and get to Amazon now before it’s over.</p>
