              <p>President Trump gave his State of the Union speech to Congress last night. I skipped it and played video games instead as part of my ongoing 2026 resolution to practice more self-care. But pinhead sycophants like CNN contributor Scott Jennings and Trump advisor Stephen Miller thought it killed, especially one moment in which the president tried to trick Democrats into appearing unpatriotic by not standing in support of <a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2026/2/1/us-judge-orders-release-of-five-year-old-and-father-from-ice-detention">ICE kidnapping kids off the street</a>.</p> <p>“If you agree with this statement, then stand up and show your support: The first duty of the American government is to protect American citizens, not illegal aliens,” Trump told Congress. Got ’em! Sick burn, Mr. President! That’s how the charmless toadies riding his coattails responded on social media. “Will be signature moment of this speech,” Jennings, who gets paid <a href="https://www.status.news/p/scott-jennings-cnn-deal">the big bucks</a> to launder fascist talking points on cable TV, wrote somewhat normally. “Trump nailed them.”</p>

 <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">Why does this guy always talk like a World of Warcraft npc <a href="https://t.co/HWIIhBWpSz">https://t.co/HWIIhBWpSz</a></p> <p>— Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (@AOC) <a href="https://twitter.com/AOC/status/2026696988272546182?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">February 25, 2026</a></p></blockquote>  <p>Then Miller responded like that friend at the party who promised you they they’d be chill and then moments later won’t shut up about the<em> Magic: The Gathering</em> banned card lists from 20 years ago. “Democrats declared to the world their searing disdain for, and profound disloyalty to, the actual citizens of the United States,” he wrote. “They were repeatedly entreated to stand. Over and over. They refused. It was a moment that chills to the bone and which will live for a thousand years.”</p> <p>Sounds about right for the guy <a href="https://www.yahoo.com/entertainment/celebrity/articles/stephen-miller-danced-ice-ice-020716169.html?guccounter=1&amp;guce_referrer=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZ29vZ2xlLmNvbS8&amp;guce_referrer_sig=AQAAABw1aucCtL0V3ooK882fxCGI3X9QkIovPuwGEiGYga_saAdGOLkXEfWwJdp4GXy_J7NKxRUKksUF1JrPccktILsrFTZ165XDBCDN7u8m0wwvMdWQaInFvi2yW8B2X6uw6y7LBUiRR3Mt7EH6_D3r_GLcmA3t8XWgmnGDKdlBQuuh">dancing like this</a> to “Ice Ice Baby” at Mar-a-Lago hours before his wife announces their fourth child. “Why does this guy always talk like a World of Warcraft npc,” Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez wrote back. “Holy shit…Wasn’t expecting to catch that stray today…” responded veteran Blizzard designer Chadd Nervig in the comments. Previously a developer on <em>World of Warcraft</em>, Nervig now works on <em>Hearthstone</em>, which has immortalized some of the MMO’s best NPCs in card form. It would all be that much funnier if Miller wasn’t foaming at the mouth 24/7 to ruin other people’s lives.</p>

              <p>Full Circle, the studio behind the online-only <a href="https://kotaku.com/skate-season-2-update-skin-tone-changes-tired-stoners-character-changes-2000649710"><em>Skate</em></a> reboot that launched last year, has announced that an unspeciifed amount of developers have been laid off.</p> <p><a href="https://www.ea.com/ea-studios/full-circle/news/an-update-from-fullcircle">On February 25,</a> EA-owned developer Full Circle posted on its official website that it is “reshaping” the studio to “better support” <em>Skate’s</em> “long-term future.” What does that actually mean? Well, it translates to some members of the studio being laid off.</p>

 <p>“These shifts mean making changes to our team structure, and some roles will be impacted,” posted Full Circle. “The teammates affected are talented colleagues and friends who helped build the foundation of skate. Their creativity and dedication are deeply ingrained in what players experience today. This decision is not a reflection of their impact and we’re committed to supporting them through this transition.”</p>

 <p><em>Kotaku</em> has contacted EA for more information on the layoffs.</p> <p>Full Circle says its work on <em>Skate</em> will continue, adding: “Our commitment to <em>Skate</em> and to the millions of players who believe in it, remains strong.” The post wraps up with a message to the devs who are losing their jobs. “To our departing teammates: thank you. <em>Skate</em> exists because of your hard work and dedication to the craft.”</p> <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/respawn-layoffs-star-wars-jedi-apex-legends-titanfall-1851778330">This is just the latest in a string of recent layoffs</a> <a href="https://kotaku.com/black-panther-ea-cliffhanger-monolith-productions-1851782787">and game cancellations at EA</a>. Full Circle’s post doesn’t connect these layoffs to the massive <a href="https://kotaku.com/ea-sale-saudi-arabia-madden-pif-jared-kushner-2000629829">$55 billion Saudi Arabia-backed buyout</a> that is currently in the works. <a href="https://kotaku.com/skate-4-steam-reviews-microtransactions-always-online-2000626503"><em>Skate</em> launched in September</a> of last year with a high playercount on SteamDB, but the online-only MMO-lite skating game has struggled to keep players around and news of a <a href="https://kotaku.com/skate-4-grom-paywall-location-new-map-island-2000671466">new paid map expansion hasn’t helped win back frustrated fans.</a> The game’s third season launches March 10.</p>

              <p>Another AA publisher is hanging on for dear life. Amazon continues to flee AAA gaming like it didn’t just make $77 billion in net income last year. And a $20 million fine on Reddit shows why the scourge of online age-verification requirements has become such a messy fight. It’s the latest edition of Morning Checkpoint, <em>Kotaku</em>‘s daily roundup of gaming news, rumors, and culture. Were you waiting for the right time to check out <em>Ninja Gaiden 4</em>? It was a lot of fun and <a href="https://x.com/TeamNINJAStudio/status/2026688643667214432">is about to get new DLC</a>.</p> <p>I’m still trying to read the finely crumbled tea leaves in the new CEO of Xbox’s <a href="https://kotaku.com/asha-sharma-xbox-future-plans-roadmap-2000673378">first big interview since taking over</a>. She promises AI won’t displace creativity and that nothing is off the table in terms of a rethink. But she’s also waiting to complete a listening tour before deciding what to change. Matt Booty, meanwhile, promises first-party development remains a key pillar of Microsoft Gaming, including small indie games like Double Fine’s <em>Keeper</em>. Only one thing is for certain: Xbox’s Major Nelson is <a href="https://x.com/majornelson/status/2026423036908618209">ready to report back for duty</a>.</p>

 <h2>Nacon has some overdue bills</h2> <p>The French publisher announced it doesn’t currently have enough cash to pay its debts, leading it to file for insolvency, <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/nacon-files-for-insolvency-says-its-assessing-all-possible-solutions-to-continue-running/"><em>VGC</em> reports</a>. It says the “procedure will enable the company to continue its business, renegotiate its debts, and develop a credible and effective continuation plan.” It recently released the underwhelming <i>Styx: Blades of Greed</i> and is preparing for the launch of the troubled RPG sequel <em>Greedfall 2</em> in March.</p> <p>Last year it published <em>Hell Is Us</em>, a grim but novel Soulslike that received a fair amount of praise but not much wider attention. It follows an AWOL military operative searching for his family in a war-torn country infested with supernatural beings. Unlike most modern games, it eschewed clear objectives and quest markers, which some found refreshing and others found tedious.</p>

 <p>Nacon was also set to publish <i>Terminator: Survivors</i> last year but the game was unexpectedly delayed indefinitely. The survival shooter also dropped its plans for Early Access and multiplayer co-op.</p> <h2>Amazon abandon’s <em>Forza Horizon</em> director’s new open-world game</h2> <p>UK developer Maverick Games is no longer working with Amazon, <a href="https://www.thegamebusiness.com/p/amazon-abandons-its-open-world-driving"><em>The Game Business</em> reports</a>. The studio was cofounded in 2022 by former <em>Forza Horizon</em> creative director Mike Brown to make a AAA narrative-led game, with the tech giant signed on to publish. It’s unclear what will happen if the team doesn’t find a new partner. “Development of our debut title continues to progress as strongly as planned,” Maverick Games said. “We’re in active dialogue with partners who share our long-term ambition for the IP and look forward to sharing more later this year.”</p>

 <h2>Xbox cloud gaming gets an upgrade on console</h2> <p>“We’re now rolling out up to 1440p, higher bitrate streaming for Xbox Game Pass Ultimate members, delivering sharper visuals and more responsive gameplay across supported titles and regions,” reads a <a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2026/02/25/february-xbox-update-1440p-streaming-rog-xbox-ally-updates-and-more/">new post on Xbox Wire</a>. A bunch of updates have also been rolled out to the Xbox PC gaming app to make navigation feel more responsive.</p> <h2><em>Magic: The Gathering</em> lawsuit gets dismissed</h2> <p>Filed earlier this year, it accused Hasbro executives of misleading investors about the sustainability of the card game’s profits and alleged that overprinting was happening despite the known harm it would do to the brand. <a href="https://www.polygon.com/mtg-hasbro-2026-lawsuit-magic-card-overproduction/"><em>Polygon</em> reports</a> it was voluntarily withdrawn while another shareholder lawsuit continues. Hasbro previously said the claims had no merit.</p>

 <h2>Reddit gets fined nearly $20 million over child privacy issues</h2> <p>UK regulators said the company shirked its responsibility to know which of its users were 13 or younger and handle any personal information collected accordingly (via <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cwyx0xggepjo">the <em>BBC</em></a>). It’s one of the regulatory pressures leading companies like Reddit, Discord, and others to implement AI age checks which are in turn making users mad. “The ICO’s insistence that we collect more private information on every UK user is counterintuitive and at odds with our strong belief in our users’ online privacy and safety,” a spokesperson for Reddit said. The company will appeal the ruling.</p> <h2>20 years later, modders are still trying to “fix” <em>Morrowind</em></h2> <p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2026/02/inside-the-quixotic-team-trying-to-build-an-entire-world-in-a-20-year-old-game/">A great new feature at <em>Ars Technica</em></a> details the long-running efforts of <em>Elder Scrolls</em> fans to make <em>Morrowind</em>‘s world feel as vast as that of its predecessor, <em>Daggerfall</em>. The result is multiple groups of modders spanning decades working together to try and piece together all of Tamriel in the 2002 PC game.</p> <p>“We have some really wonderful people who are the old guard that feel like they are the comfortable welders, and they’re all very wise,” college-age modder Meadhainnigh said. “But even in the newest editions, we’re not here because we think that it’s all going to be done within our lifetimes. We like to joke about 2090 and about raising our children to work on the project. We just like to look at the next release, and that tends to be exciting enough to get us going.”</p> <h2>ICYMI:</h2> <ul> <li><strong><a href="https://kotaku.com/charity-steam-pc-games-bundle-best-deal-2026-fps-cultic-selaco-boltgun-2000673339">This boomer shooter bundle for charity is the best gaming deal of the week</a></strong></li> <li><strong><a href="https://kotaku.com/tokyo-scramble-switch-2-worst-game-2026-2000673341">A new worst game of 2026 has arrive and it’s a Switch 2 exclusive&nbsp;</a></strong></li> <li><strong><a href="https://kotaku.com/discord-delays-controversial-age-verification-requirements-2000673309">Discord delays its age-verification rollout but blames the backlash on people misunderstanding the details</a></strong></li> </ul> <h2>Watch this:</h2>
