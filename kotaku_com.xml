Many of these games look great—like Blendo Games’ new FPS <em>Skin Deep,</em> which is set in a giant spaceship—but only one of them has 2025's song of the year and that’s<em> </em><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.youtube.com/redirect?event=video_description&amp;redir_token=QUFFLUhqbE1uRDdHYUV0b25WaVVtYU9WaXE2UVhDckNfUXxBQ3Jtc0tsOVcxX0ozaUVkS3U4VGdzMzAxWDBka2dveDR1QmpDTzRrU01LU19BazdKMGhXTU5EQ2h4ZFZqaUIwODA4dDhNSEtkWkJtYlVZaV90Q3gtMW9QN0hKYzVydWQyaXRpRTJZck1ENkdRVks5TzFFWkZ6SQ&amp;q=https%3A%2F%2Fstore.steampowered.com%2Fapp%2F1875320%2Fto_a_T%2F&amp;v=E-QlrrC4vFk&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.youtube.com/redirect?event=video_description&amp;redir_token=QUFFLUhqbE1uRDdHYUV0b25WaVVtYU9WaXE2UVhDckNfUXxBQ3Jtc0tsOVcxX0ozaUVkS3U4VGdzMzAxWDBka2dveDR1QmpDTzRrU01LU19BazdKMGhXTU5EQ2h4ZFZqaUIwODA4dDhNSEtkWkJtYlVZaV90Q3gtMW9QN0hKYzVydWQyaXRpRTJZck1ENkdRVks5TzFFWkZ6SQ&amp;q=https%3A%2F%2Fstore.steampowered.com%2Fapp%2F1875320%2Fto_a_T%2F&amp;v=E-QlrrC4vFk" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>To a T, </em>which is coming out this May</a></span>. </p><p>Let’s watch the trailer and enjoy:</p><p>So what is <em>To a T</em>? Good question, because as cute and wonderful as this trailer and its song might be, I wasn’t sure what the game actually was. Its really confusing that at the end there is a note mentioning that this new game isn’t actually <em>about </em>food or cooking despite the giraffe’s catchy song. </p><p>According to Annapurna Interactive, <em>To a T</em> is being developed by <em>Katamari Damacy </em>creator  Keita Takahashi and is described as a “colorful” “narrative adventure” game. Here’s the official description: </p><blockquote data-type="BlockQuote"><p><em>To a T </em>is a charming, colorful adventure game about a teen navigating life in a small town with their cute dog companion. While their body is stuck in a T-pose, they do their best to make the most of it. </p></blockquote><p>I’m down to play this. I mean I was in the moment I heard “The Giraffe Song” by Rebecca Sugar (<em>Steven Universe</em>). The game is set to launch on PS5, Steam, and Xbox Series X/S on May 28.</p><hr><p>Beyond <em>To a T,</em> <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://youtu.be/5XTSFLFV7e8&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://youtu.be/5XTSFLFV7e8" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">the Annpurna showcase</a></span> also had some great trailers for some other cool-looking games.

I guess the name of the game gives that away. </p><p>It’s actually kind of strange that as we’ve reached a point where video game visuals, especially those depicting nature, can look nearly photoreal, we’ve not seen more of these photo sim games. I can’t afford to visit all of these locations and take photos of their gorgeous landscapes. But I can do just that in <em>Lushfoil Photography Sim</em>, which is planned to launch on PS5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC on April 15. </p><p>And if you want to watch the whole showcase, which featured a new trailer for <em>Wanderstop </em>and news of a PS5 port of<em> Sayonara Wild Hearts</em>, you can watch the entire event below. It’s about 25 minutes long. </p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Last year the card game received the adult PEGI 18+ rating due to its poker gameplay and rules. But thanks to a successful appeal, <em>Balatro’s </em>rating has been lowered to PEGI 12+. </p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="197298" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="Live Forever in the Universe of 'New World: Aeternum'" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="108" data-playlist="197298,197284,197260" data-current="197298"><div><p>Live Forever in the Universe of 'New World: Aeternum'</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197298/197298_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197298/197298_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197298/197298_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197298/197298_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"></video></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p><em>Balatro</em>, which launched a year ago last week, has been a huge hit across the globe. The roguelike card game  tasks players with putting together high-scoring poker hands using luck, skill, and powerful joker cards that act like supernatural wildcards. <em>Balatro</em>—available now on consoles, PC, and mobile devices—isn’t a game about gambling and doesn’t include any violence or real money transactions. That didn’t stop PEGI from randomly, with no warning, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/balatro-nintendo-switch-eshop-removed-gambling-1851301756?_gl=1*iow2wp*_ga*MzE4MTUxNzQ2LjE3NDA0MTE5MzE.*_ga_V4QNJTT5L0*MTc0MDQyMjE1OC4zLjAuMTc0MDQyMjE1OC42MC4wLjA.&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/balatro-nintendo-switch-eshop-removed-gambling-1851301756?_gl=1*iow2wp*_ga*MzE4MTUxNzQ2LjE3NDA0MTE5MzE.*_ga_V4QNJTT5L0*MTc0MDQyMjE1OC4zLjAuMTc0MDQyMjE1OC42MC4wLjA.">raising the game’s rating from 3+ to 18+,</a></span> however. The American equivalent would essentially be the ESRB  changing a game’s rating from E to M. Now, finally, PEGI has realized how silly it was to rate <em>Balatro </em>18+. </p><p>On February 24, Balatro creator and developer LocalThunk confirmed that after his publisher had appealed to PEGI, <em>Balatro’s </em>rating had been lowered from the adults only 18+ to the more sensible 12+, which is similar to an ESRB T rating. </p><p>“This is a good step from PEGI - bringing nuance to their ratings criteria that used to be 18+ or nothing. I hope this change will allow developers to create without being unfairly punished,” <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://x.com/LocalThunk/status/1894076713522384943&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://x.com/LocalThunk/status/1894076713522384943" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">posted LocalThunk</a></span>. </p><p>Over on the PEGI website, the group confirmed it had lowered <em>Balatro</em>’s rating as well as the rating of <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/balatro-luck-landlord-google-play-store-gambling-mobile-1851731303&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/balatro-luck-landlord-google-play-store-gambling-mobile-1851731303"><em>Luck Be A Landord</em></a></span><em>—</em>a game that featured slot machines and directly inspired <em>Balatro</em>—for similar reasons. </p><p>“The Complaints Board concluded that, although [<em>Balatro</em>] explains the various hands of poker, the roguelike deck-building game contained mitigating fantastical elements that warranted a PEGI 12 rating,” <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://pegi.info/news/pegi-complaints-board-amends-classifications-balatro-and-luck-be-landlord-pegi-12&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://pegi.info/news/pegi-complaints-board-amends-classifications-balatro-and-luck-be-landlord-pegi-12" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">said the board on the PEGI website.</a></span> </p><p>PEGI further explained that <em>Luck Be a Landord</em>’s rating change from 18+ to 12+ was because “the same arguments as above applied: although the game features a slot machine mechanic, there were no specific transferable gambling skills.”</p><p>The PEGI rule that any game that teaches or glamorizes simulated gambling will result in an automatic 18+ rating isn’t going away. However, the board says that it will provide 12+ ratings to games, like <em>Balatro</em>, that don’t simulate gambling in a casino or betting hall. </p><p>“PEGI acknowledges the finding of the Complaints Board appeals panel in regards to amending the classifications of these games,” said the board. </p><p>“The PEGI system continuously evolves in line with cultural expectations and the guidance of independent experts who support our assessment process. PEGI strives to apply ratings criteria fairly, consistently, and transparently to ensure that audiences understand the type of content that is present in games.”</p><p> .<br></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
