When they defeat someone in this metaphysical space, the target’s real-world counterpart has a “change of heart” and repents for their crimes.

While the original group were facing serious issues of systemic corruption, and here it appears they’re facing a petty criminal with a pro-wrestler name, it’s not quite the downgrade it seems. The Subway Slammer, also known as Takeyuki Kiuchi, is a disgraced baseball player who has since retired from the sport and gone to work at a corporate desk job. His athletic career ended after a sexual harassment scandal, and now all his misogynistic tendencies are manifesting in violent acts in Tokyo subway stations, because his “Shadow” in the metaverse is out of control.</p><p>Surely this must be dealt with, and the Phantom Thieves with their ability to enter the Metaverse and face these distorted villains are the ones to do it. But the over-the-top self-seriousness with which <em>The Phantom X </em>treats a guy with such a crass nickname, who so cartoonishly shoulder checks people on the subway, has made it perfect meme fodder for <em>Persona </em>fans. <em>The Phantom X </em>has been out overseas since last year, so some <em>Persona </em>fans were already well aware of this storyline. Now that it’s out worldwide, everyone is in on the joke.</p><p>To be fair, the issue <em>The Phantom X </em>is depicting here is an important one. There are plenty of real-world reports of subway station violence in big cities, sometimes ending in casualties as victims are pushed onto the tracks. The problem is that the game is depicting Kiuchi’s crimes in such a way that it lends itself to the kind of unintentional meme-bait that makes it hard to take seriously. X (formerly Twitter) user <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://x.com/DeJected_Axe/status/1939373198505623932&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://x.com/DeJected_Axe/status/1939373198505623932" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">DeJected_Axe put it best</a></span> when they said calling him the Subway Slammer feels like giving him a “<em>Scooby-Doo </em>villain” nickname. It feels like the game isn’t treating his crimes with the gravity they deserve. How am I supposed to hear a grown man say “The whole subway’s mine for the slammin’” and not giggle softly to myself?</p><p>All that being said, it sounds like <em>The Phantom X</em>’s story probably gets better <em>later</em>. Yusuke Nitta, who worked as a scenario planner on the original <em>Persona 5</em> and its extended <em>Royal </em>edition, and as a writer on the tactical RPG <em>Tactica</em>, said in a <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/personaphantomx/comments/1lnt17q/in_a_deleted_twitter_post_yusuke_nitta_revealed/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/personaphantomx/comments/1lnt17q/in_a_deleted_twitter_post_yusuke_nitta_revealed/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">deleted X post</a></span> that he wasn’t involved in the Subway Slammer story, and was brought on to write for the game in its third chapter. He apparently removed the post after he got “emotional” seeing the reaction to the Subway Slammer storyline, and said, “Rest assured, <em>P5X</em> will get more and more interesting from now on.”</p><p>I haven’t had a chance to boot up my copy of <em>Persona 5: The Phantom X</em>, but I <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/persona-5-the-phantom-x-gacha-rolls-preview-mobile-pc-1851783773&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/persona-5-the-phantom-x-gacha-rolls-preview-mobile-pc-1851783773">did play a chunk of the Subway Slammer section</a></span> before the game launched. I don’t know if this makes me want to play the full game more or less. Maybe more? I gotta take down the greatest villain in <em>Persona </em>history, right?</p><p>.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://kotaku.com/persona-5-phantom-x-subway-slammer-villain-clips-gacha-1851785428]]></content:encoded>

It’s also one that has had a mixed reputation over multiple entries. I groan and grumble every time I unintentionally activate it; but using it correctly with the right weapons and skills feels amazing.</p><h2 id="h43520"><a id=""></a>How does Sliding work?</h2><p>There are quite a few ways to activate this maneuver. <strong>The most common way to make your hunter slide is by running or rolling down a steep slope.</strong> While running downhill, <strong>take notice when the hunter’s animation changes to them trying to straighten their body out.</strong> This lasts for just a second before they begin sliding. If you want to trigger it even faster, rolling during a run will immediately transition to the slide animation.</p><p><strong>Certain weapon attacks can also combine with the sliding state, as long as they’re performed on a sloped surface.</strong> Ironically enough, no attacks that feature your hunter sliding on the ground during the animation will work. The following weapons can trigger a slide in <em>Monster Hunter Wilds</em>:</p><ul data-type="List" data-style="Bullet"><li><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/monster-hunter-wilds-best-weapon-the-charge-blade-guide-1851769340&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/monster-hunter-wilds-best-weapon-the-charge-blade-guide-1851769340">Charge Blade’s</a></span> Forward Slash</li><li>Dual Blades’ Demon Flurry Rush</li><li>Gunlance’s Lunging Upthrust</li><li>Hammer’s Charge</li><li>Lance’s Dash Attack</li><li>Sword &amp; Shield’s Advancing Slash</li></ul><p>If any of the above has sent you zooming down a hill, it might help to know that this maneuver does have a purpose. Every weapon has unique actions that can be performed while sliding.

My personal favorite is getting crazy air with the Dual Blades and then spinning down a monster’s back to inflict some major damage. These are all pretty fun once you get the hang of them.</p><h2 id="h43521"><a id=""></a>How to master Sliding</h2><figure id="" data-id="5e9ff074ead72fab2610db85900f82a7" data-recommend-id="image://5e9ff074ead72fab2610db85900f82a7" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The Change Equipment screen, highlighting the Buttery Leathercraft Group Skill, Affinity Sliding." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="The Change Equipment screen, highlighting the Buttery Leathercraft Group Skill, Affinity Sliding." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Capcom / Samuel Moreno / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="5e9ff074ead72fab2610db85900f82a7" data-recommend-id="image://5e9ff074ead72fab2610db85900f82a7" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The Change Equipment screen, highlighting the Buttery Leathercraft Group Skill, Affinity Sliding." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>The most important tip I can give here is to be aware of what slopes might trigger a slide. The incline in the back of the Training Area is an excellent example. When you’re out gathering or hunting a monster, go ahead and experiment by rolling down some hills. This will be handy knowledge for future hunts so that you don’t slide when you don’t mean to. I know I wasn’t the only person to accidentally rush down the Windward Plains’ desert dunes while hunting <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/monster-hunter-wilds-mh-mon-hun-arch-tempered-rey-dau-1851782762&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/monster-hunter-wilds-mh-mon-hun-arch-tempered-rey-dau-1851782762">Arch-Tempered Rey Dau</a></span>.</p><p>Once you feel confident about using this technique when you intend to, it’s time to consider increasing its offensive power. Affinity Sliding is a skill that provides a boost to your <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/monster-hunter-wilds-affinity-meaning-negative-upgrade-1851775744&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/monster-hunter-wilds-affinity-meaning-negative-upgrade-1851775744">Affinity</a></span> when sliding on terrain. This is another case where the skill’s description fails to convey just how amazing a buff you receive. I’ve confirmed through testing that it provides a massive 30 percent Affinity boost that lasts for 30 seconds. No matter if your build is low on Affinity or already boasts a high percentage, this is an impressive upgrade.</p><p>The main drawback is that this is tied to the Buttery Leathercraft Group Skill, which is unfortunately attached to some weaker armors. If you’re going to hunt a monster in a hilly area and want high Affinity, including it in a build might be a good strategy. Just try not to activate this buff when you’re too close to a monster, since the skill won’t kick in until you’ve been sliding for about a second.</p><p>I can’t blame anyone who gets annoyed by this mechanic. Sliding past an enemy is a huge inconvenience, especially if you have to run back up a big hill to continue the fight. Understanding how to trigger it and the benefits of doing so will be a big help going forward.</p><p>.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://kotaku.com/monster-hunter-wilds-mhw-slide-hill-how-to-attack-1851785365]]></content:encoded>
