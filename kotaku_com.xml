Remember, publishers and other companies are going to pass the cost of tariffs onto consumers. “What a mess,” added Piscatella.</p><p>And if you’re thinking, “Well, I’ll just buy games digitally to avoid the price increase,” that might not be possible. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://bsky.app/profile/did:plc:bhqrrxt7yyfpwguioa7rwa7x/post/3lgb3euyyik2e&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://bsky.app/profile/did:plc:bhqrrxt7yyfpwguioa7rwa7x/post/3lgb3euyyik2e" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">As pointed out by Piscatella last year</a></span>, publishers would either raise prices on digital games to <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://bsky.app/profile/matpiscatella.bsky.social/post/3lgb3il5nws2e&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://bsky.app/profile/matpiscatella.bsky.social/post/3lgb3il5nws2e" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">reach parity with the higher cost of physical games</a></span> or, as mentioned already, simply give up entirely on producing and sell discs.

On March 4, a day after the Trump administration’s tariff against China became active, Ahmad posted that, despite some mitigation efforts, 75 percent of consoles are produced and imported from China. These consoles will be hit by the tariffs and will likely cost more to buy in the United States. It’s also likely that fewer will be produced, which could lead to supply shortages.</p><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/switch-2-ps5-prices-trump-tariffs-china-nintendo-sony-1851704901&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/switch-2-ps5-prices-trump-tariffs-china-nintendo-sony-1851704901">As we reported in January</a></span>, the president’s tariffs could see the price of consoles jump dramatically. A Switch could potentially go from $300 to $400. A PS5 Pro could see its price leap from $700 to $1000. And the Switch 2 could be slapped with a higher-than-expected price tag due to the ongoing tariffs, making a console that was potentially already going to be hard to buy in its first year even trickier and more expensive to obtain.</p><p> .<br></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
