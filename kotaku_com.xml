              <p>We can officially consider it to be last-minute holiday shopping season now, and that’s when some truly epic deals sneak up on you. Here’s one of the best ones from the audio department at Amazon — <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6392/">the top-rated Bose QuietComfort wireless headphones are a limited-time steal at just $170</a>. These are among the very best wireless headphones for Active Noise Cancellation, and it goes without saying that the sound quality is absolutely peak, because they’re from Bose.</p>
<p>The Bose QC wireless headphones are backed by more than just the Bose name. They have over 15,000 Amazon reviews that clock in at an average of 4.5 stars, among the very best in the category. That elite-level Active Noise Cancellation, deep bass, and 24 hours of playtime on a single USB-C charge are big reasons for that lofty rating, but they’re hardly the only ones.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6392/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Amazingly Customizable</h2>
<p>The Bose app isn’t just a good way to work the controls on the QuietControl headphones. It’s also where you can find the Adjustable EQ that lets you play producer and take the controls to fine-tune your favorite music. Make tiny tweaks to the bass, treble, and mid-range to suit your personal tastes, and then save the settings to your profile. The Bose app is also the route to the latest firmware updates so you can ensure your QC headphones have all of the latest features and tech.</p>
<p>Some of that recent tech that makes the Bose QuietControl wireless headphoes such a great buy at half price at Amazon? How about multipoint Bluetooth connectivity so you don’t have to go through the disconnect-reconnect toggle every time you want to switch your headphones from your laptop to your smartphone or other device. There’s also the Aware Mode that works hand in hand with the legendarily good Quiet mode — switching to Aware mode keeps your sound at pro levels while reducing the level of noise cancellation to allow enough sound in for safety or conversations.</p>



<h2>Listen All Day Long</h2>
<p>The Bose QuietComfort headphone have a literal full-day battery life on a single USB-C charge — up to 24 hours so you can listen to your music, podcasts, or audio books as long as you like. If you forget to recharge them and find the battery level is low or even dead, a 15-minute quick charge will give you a 2.5-hour boost. Those lengthy listening sessions are also exceptionally comfortable, thanks to the exceptionally plush ear cushions and lightweight construction of the Bose QuietComfort headphones.</p>
<p>Of the 11 different color models of the Bose QuietComfort wireless headphones, only three are priced this low during this Amazon deal (Moonlight Grey, Pink, and Sandstone), so be sure you’re clicking the right one. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6392/">And do it quickly, because this $170 deal on a pro-level set of Bose wireless headphones is going, and going fast.&nbsp;</a></p>

              <p>Apple’s willingness to cut huge deals on their newest tech gear has been one of the biggest and most pleasant surprises of the 2025 holiday shopping season. It’s still not too late to cash in on this surprising new trend, if this latest Amazon deal is any indication. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6030/">The 2025 M4 MacBook Air is still just $749 at Amazon, its lowest price ever and a big $250 step down from its usual $999.</a></p>
<p>The M4 MacBooks are one of the best places to look for amazing deals since being supplanted at the top of the Apple ecosystem by the M5 chip last October. But the price drops on the M4 models go way beyond the step down from the M5 to the M4, because the M4 machines are still absolutely elite-level computers, loaded with Apple Intelligence, Apple’s industry-best Liquid Retina display, outstanding cameras and speakers, and enough memory and power for heavy-duty creative work.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6030/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>A Small Step Down</h2>
<p>The talk in techworld has been all about the M5 MacBooks since they debuted in October, and rightfully so. The M5 machines are industry-best laptops, so when we see a huge deal on an M4 model like this one, the question becomes, just how big is the difference? The M5 chip is a faster CPU by up to 20% and faster in terms of AI thanks to new integrated Neural Accelerators. Big numbers to be sure, but how noticeable to the everyday user? Answer: Not very, unless you’re completely immersed in exceptionally heavy AI work, and even then it’s an incremental difference.</p>
<p>So while there may be an M5 MacBook Air coming in the early months of 2026, it’s a fairly safe bet that the resulting price drop on this M4 model won’t go any lower than this Amazon deal for $749, and the performance difference won’t come near meeting the price difference. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6030/">The time to grab the M4 MacBook Air is now, during this last-minute holiday sale at Amazon.</a></p>



<h2>All the Bells, All the Whistles</h2>
<p>It’s been less than a year since the M4 MacBook Air dropped, so it has all of the perks and tech that make the MacBooks so coveted. The M4 chip itself has a 10-core CPU and up to 10 cores of GPU, with 16GB of unified memory and a 256GB SSD. It’s the ideal machine for photo and video editing and other content creation-related tasks. The 12MP Center Stage camera, four built-in speakers with Spatial Audio, and studio-quality mics make the MacBook Air the perfect video conferencing or video call laptop, along with its slim, lightweight design.</p>
<p>We’ve all been so used to a $749 MacBook either being 2 or 3 generations old or having the words “refurbished” or “scratch and dent” attached to the deal that the idea of that price being on a brand-new 2025 model is a little surreal. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6030/">But this Amazon deal taking $250 off of this 13-inch M4 MacBook Air is the real deal, and it’s real close to being real gone.&nbsp;</a></p>
