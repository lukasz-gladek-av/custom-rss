              <p><span>You know, if you’re ever looking for an example of the power of human artistry, you can typically look to incredible sculptures and statues that depict the human form like </span><i><span>David </span></i><span>by Michelangelo or the work of Rodin. But these pieces have the advantage of not being mass produced for people to buy and stick on the Nintendo system to unlock cosmetics. The </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/resident-evil-9-requiem-leon-infection-dead-dies-theory-2000663084"><span>Leon Kennedy</span></a> <a href="https://kotaku.com/resident-evil-9-requiem-preview-leon-gameplay-grace-2000662270"><i><span>Resident Evil Requiem</span></i></a><span> amiibo doesn’t have such luxuries, but it nonetheless accomplishes something remarkable as well: it somehow finally makes the zombie-shooting heartthrob ugly.</span></p> <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">Requiem for the dead. Nightmare for the living.<br>Grace Ashcroft and Leon S. Kennedy join the amiibo family in summer 2026.</p> <p>Amiibo will be sold separately. <a href="https://t.co/zOfUuU3IH3">pic.twitter.com/zOfUuU3IH3</a></p> <p>— Resident Evil (@RE_Games) <a href="https://twitter.com/RE_Games/status/2019420370554745295?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">February 5, 2026</a></p></blockquote>   <p><span>That’s not to say that the Grace Ashcroft figure is much better. Both of them look like cheap wedding cake toppers. Amiibos typically feature more stylized characters like most of Nintendo’s heroes, so they don’t often have to be very detailed. </span><i><span>Resident Evil Requiem</span></i><span>, however, is a photorealistic game that would lend itself to a more detailed statue. These figures’ faces are so generic-looking that if it weren’t for Leon’s distinctive swooping hair, I probably would have a hard time identifying him. And trust me, I’ve looked at his face extensively for decades. Where is his old man scruff?</span></p>

 <p><span>“Reading the comments I feel like I’m taking crazy pills, but I must admit I’m not familiar with Amiibo and their usual quality,” Nexxtic wrote on </span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/residentevil/comments/1qwmppb/nintendo_just_revealed_amiibo_for_both_grace_and/"><span>Reddit</span></a><span>. “Are they always this… rough? I think these look pretty bad, especially Leon. Like one of those bad Switch ports.”</span></p> <p><span>“Grace seems nice, Leon a little less so,” wrote AdResponsible5888.</span></p> <p><span>If nothing else, the existence of a Leon amiibo—a goofy looking one at that—means we get good jokes. Even if a lot of them have the same punchline.</span></p>   <p><span>Hopefully these aren’t the expensive $40+ amiibo, and are in the $15-20 range. They’re both coming out after </span><i><span>Requiem</span></i><span>’s launch, with the game itself arriving later this month on February 27 and both figures launching in the summer.</span></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Xbox released a lot of big games in 2025. <a href="https://kotaku.com/the-state-of-xbox-and-game-pass-in-2025-2000651807">It was one of the only good bits of Xbox-related news from last year</a>. And in 2026, it will release new entries in four of its oldest franchises: <em>Forza, Gears, Halo, </em>and<em> Fable.</em> But new reporting indicates that while these projects, and others including a <em>Fallout 3</em>&nbsp;remaster, are on track, Xbox is trying to avoid <em>Grand Theft Auto 6</em>‘s big launch in November.</p> <p>On February 5, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/tech/874303/microsoft-xbox-roadmap-2026-notepad?"><em>The Verge</em> reported</a> a lot of interesting tidbits and nuggets about Xbox’s plans heading into 2026. For example, the company is apparently working on a new “next-gen” Xbox controller that will support connecting via wifi, which should help reduce lag when streaming games via the cloud. But the most interesting news from the report concerns three of Xbox’s big games launching in 2026.</p>

 <p>According to <em>The Verge, <a href="https://kotaku.com/halo-1-remake-combat-evolved-trailer-hwc-teaser-xbox-ps5-2000638911">Halo: Campaign Evolved</a>,</em> a remaster of the OG game, is on track to launch this summer. Meanwhile,<a href="https://kotaku.com/gears-of-war-e-day-prequel-marcus-fenix-dom-1851531003"> <em>Gears of War: E-Day</em>, a prequel to the original </a><em><a href="https://kotaku.com/gears-of-war-e-day-prequel-marcus-fenix-dom-1851531003">Gears</a></em>, is tentatively aiming for fall. This is also the same window in which Xbox plans to launch that <a href="https://kotaku.com/fable-everything-we-know-about-the-open-world-fantasy-rpg-reboot-2000662595">long-delayed <em>Fable</em> reboot.</a> The outlet reports that it has heard Xbox has a solid idea of when the new <em>Fable</em> and <em>Gears</em> will launch, but that it’s also trying to avoid having either title land too close to<em> GTA 6</em>‘s November 19 release. And with news that marketing for the next <a href="https://kotaku.com/gta-6-still-confirmed-for-november-with-summer-marketing-blitz-planned-2000665452"><em>GTA</em> is set to start in summer</a>, it seems unlikely it will be delayed again, meaning Xbox will have to dance around that date with <em>Fable</em> and <em>Gears</em>. (<a href="https://kotaku.com/forza-horizon-6-biggest-map-japan-open-world-size-comparison-2026-ps5-xbox-2000628855"><em>Forza Horizon 6</em> is launching in May, way ahead of <em>GTA 6.</em></a>)</p> <p>Reportedly, Double Fine’s recently announced next game, the online pottery smasher <em>Kiln</em>, is set to drop in April. <em>Starfield</em> is getting new content “soon,” and the PS5 port, long rumored, is allegedly going to be revealed in the near future. And for folks sad that Bethesda didn’t announce a <em>Fallout 3</em> remaster following the <a href="https://kotaku.com/fallout-season-two-review-amazon-more-episodes-bethesda-new-vegas-2000665533">season two finale of Amazon’s Fallout show</a> after so many rumor mongers online claimed it would, don’t worry. <a href="https://kotaku.com/heres-why-fans-are-convinced-fallout-3-and-new-vegas-remasters-are-about-to-be-revealed-2000660161">The previously reported remaster is still in development</a>, according to <em>The Verge.&nbsp;</em></p>

 <p>2026 could be a big year for Xbox games once again. But ironically, Xbox enters this new era of actually having games at the same time that it has begun porting most of them to other consoles. The universe is weird like that.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[DropShot Is A Hyper-Stylized Shooter Whose Developer Isn’t Taking The Easy Way Out]]></title>
            <link>https://kotaku.com/aerial-knight-dropshot-shooter-black-game-dev-2000665741</link>
            <guid>1427308</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><span>It’s not often that a game is created in part as a eulogy to a dear friend.</span></p> <p><i><span>Aerial_Knight’s DropShot</span></i><span>, a new stylized first-person indie shooter releasing on February 17, is one of those few. It was first conceived by game director Neil Jones and his long-time friend, Daniel Wilkins. Wilkins, who passed away in 2024, was a sound designer, composer on the games </span><i><span>Never Yield</span></i><span> and </span><i><span>We Never Yield</span></i><span>, and game developer.</span></p> <p><span>Based out of Detroit, Jones (Aerial_Knight) explains that he has a book filled with game ideas, and </span><i><span>DropShot</span></i><span> was one of those concepts he spoke openly and excitedly about with Wilkins. He developed the new shooter within a year with the same excitement he’s maintained since his first title, </span><i><span>Aerial_Knight’s Never Yield</span></i><span>, which was released in 2021.</span></p>

 <p><span>“I feel video games are the most expansive art form. You literally have to touch everything. From level design, interior design, you gotta create the outfits, the music, the sounds. You’re creating an entire world, so it’s a ton of work, but I just, you know, I’m at peace when I’m sitting in front of a computer just working on some stuff and just making my own games,” he explains.</span></p> <p><span>Jones says that as an indie developer, he wants to keep making games for as long as he can. His personal story of how and why he makes games is similar to that of many other creators; he feels a drive to make things he cares about. Creating titles for underserved communities and establishing his own lane in the games industry also remain important to him.</span></p>

 <p><span>&nbsp;Jones says, “There’s still not a lot of Black characters or Black-coded characters, you know, because Smoke Wallace (the lead character of </span><i><span>DropShot</span></i><span>), he’s purple, but everybody who looks at him [says] ‘Oh, he’s Black.’ “</span></p>

 <figure id="attachment_2000665745" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000665745"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000665745">©Aerial_Knight</figcaption></figure> <p><span>Regarding Smoke being purple, the game originally didn’t have a story. However, for marketing purposes, it was made up on the fly and added in later on. The hero is bitten by a radioactive dragon, the creature eats his family, he can fire bullets from his fingers, and Smoke engages in aerial battles for revenge.</span></p> <p><span>While </span><i><span>DropShot </span></i><span>is a single-player FPS, Jones admits he is not a fan of guns. He deliberately decided to have Smoke shoot with finger guns so he wouldn’t have to model guns for the hero; all the marketing prominently features the purple-skinned lead with fingers aimed at enemies. Meanwhile, the enemies you face are armed. These choices, Jones explains, are intended to subvert FPS titles. It’s also a reflection of his own desire to not have another piece of media with a Black leading man armed with a gun.</span></p>

 <p><span>“Now this was gonna be my take on a shooter, how would I make a shooter, but I hate guns. There’s a lot of stuff that you can do outside of adding guns. We have this one power-up: you destroy a dragon egg and get power-ups, and he has 8 arms come out, turning into a Gatling gun of finger blasts. So, we’re just trying to be as creative as possible to kind of negate the violence of it all,” he explains.</span></p> <p><span>“…I didn’t want to model a gun. I modeled it for the enemies and whatnot. So, it wasn’t against making guns. It was just the main character. I was [thinking] it’s so boring to just put a gun in his hand.”</span></p> <figure id="attachment_2000665746" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000665746"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000665746">©Aerial_Knight</figcaption></figure> <p><span>Making a game is no easy feat. While Jones himself served as the main designer and director, he required a close-knit team to help him create </span><i><span>DropShot</span></i><span>. He enlisted the help of past collaborator Julie Huynh, and rounding out what would become Aerial_Knight Games were Tomas Abrams and Benjamin Campbell. With the team by his side, Jones found developing this fast-paced, 50-level shooter relatively easy.</span></p>

 <p><span>“This is the third game,” Jones said. “So, I got a good workflow now, and this was the easiest of all the games we made. Because the environments are a lot simpler. You’re in the sky, so there are clouds and floating rocks, planes, stuff like that, and that’s it. So it was just me focusing mostly on mechanics and level design.”</span></p> <p><span>&nbsp;“…The hardest part, I would say, would probably be the cutscenes. It’s because they’re all hand-animated. I did them all myself, and we have 150 cutscenes for each level. We have 50 levels, each level has a custom intro and a custom ending, and then some levels had these mini option cutscenes in between.”</span></p>

 <p><span>The small nature of the development team also helped make the game’s development a smooth process. Jones notes that with a cohort this small, it’s easier to manage people, communicate, and iterate on ideas. If the group were larger, processes would become more complicated, so the game director prefers to keep teams small, much like the games he likes to create.</span></p> <p><span>Unsurprisingly, the team of four also had a fun time generating additional ideas for the game. Jones points to a cow that’s featured in the game’s trailer.</span></p> <p><span>“I had this old cow model. I put it in the trailer and made it say something, and everybody loved the cow so much,” he says.</span></p> <p><span>The bovine creature became more prominent throughout the course of the game’s development.</span></p>

 <figure id="attachment_2000665747" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000665747"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000665747">©Aerial_Knight</figcaption></figure> <p><span>The team said, “Hey, I want to make a cow level, special cow sunglasses, and a hidden cow event that happens.” I said all right, because I do this thing on my team, I give everybody one wish. Because I wanted [</span><i><span>DropShot</span></i><span>] to feel like everybody’s, you know, this is a group activity. My name is on it or whatever, but that’s because, you know, I’m putting all the risk out there, for branding, but everybody gets a wish.”</span></p> <p><span>When it comes to sales performance, the game director is confident </span><i><span>DropShot</span></i><span> will do well. However, Jones admits that a title’s market success depends largely on luck, a factor that he says many game developers don’t appropriately acknowledge. Which is why he continues to bet on himself and the games he creates. This also included the decision to self-publish, which he says was an easy choice.</span></p> <p><span>To fully explain his decision to eschew a publisher deal, he cited a quote from Lisa “Left Eye” Lopes of the popular girl group TLC. In a 1999 episode of VH1’s </span><i><span>Behind the Music</span></i><span>, Lopes explained how she and her bandmates were broke after selling 10 million records.</span></p> <p><span>“That means that every time an album gets sold, TLC gets 0.56 cents. So, 10 million records, $5.6 million seems like a lot of money. Well, it’s not a lot of money when the record company spent $3 million to record your album. And in the record business, we pay all costs back to the record company. We paid recording costs and video costs, so now we have $2.6 million left. Well, guess what? When you have that much money, you’re in about the 47 percent tax bracket. So that immediately gets deducted to $1.3 million,” said Lopes.</span></p>

 <p><span>Jones admits the decision meant more work on the backend when self-publishing, but he says it was worth it. If the title sells 10,000 copies, that would be enough to fund the next slate of titles for Never Yield Games. Autonomy means a lot to him as a game developer, creatively and business-wise.</span></p> <p><span>It’s why all his games are labeled Aerial_Knight, followed by their respective titles. As he explains, it’s for branding purposes, so people know it’s his work. He can even be found on social media saying no to commentators who suggest removing the label. Jones makes the point that people wouldn’t ask that of prominent figures in the games industry.</span></p>

            <title><![CDATA[Blizzard Is Open To GenAI But The Overwatch Devs Don’t Want It: ‘We Want This To Feel Like A Handcrafted Universe’]]></title>
            <link>https://kotaku.com/overwatch-blizzard-genai-aaron-keller-president-faries-2000666079</link>
            <guid>1427251</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><span>As AI continues to encroach on game development, the worry that the studios that make your favorite games are dabbling in the tech, especially for art assets and written dialogue, grows ever greater. Sometimes this concern and the scrutiny that comes with it are well-founded, but other times it leads to witch hunts with fans seeing AI-generated art where it actually doesn’t exist. Blizzard’s </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/overwatch-2-spotlight-story-vendetta-cinematic-new-heroes-2000665327"><i><span>Overwatch </span></i><span>team</span></a><span> has been the subject of </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/overwatch-2-wuyang-juno-venture-sprays-ai-generated-2000626941"><span>these moments of mass hysteria</span></a><span>. So what exactly is Blizzard’s stance on genAI? Well, it sounds like the company itself is of one mind, while the </span><i><span>Overwatch </span></i><span>team itself is in a different camp.</span></p> <p><span>In a group interview on Blizzard’s Irvine campus last month that </span><i><span>Kotaku </span></i><span>was present for, </span><i><span>Overwatch </span></i><span>leadership was asked by </span><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/blizzard-president-supports-generative-ai-exploration"><i><span>Eurogamer</span></i></a><span> if the company had been integrating genAI into its workflow. Blizzard president Johanna Faries said the company wants to take a “dev-led” approach that allows its teams to use whatever tech is out there to “the extent that they’re comfortable” and in line with what the company believes is “responsible.”</span></p>

 <p><span>“We do actually, at Blizzard, have a centralized governance team specifically focused on AI and the role it can or should play in our development cycles,” Faries said. “What’s great about that is it’s very cross-functional, so you’re going to have voices from around the horn thinking about not just what’s hot-topic now, but where do we want to be five, 10 years from now? What’s the implication on our teams? What’s the implication on our values? How do we make sure that we don’t stymie the opportunity for devs, artists, whomever, to want to play with new tools and play in the sandbox, if it unlocks creativity or gets rid of drudgery or what have you? We want happy devs, right?</span></p> <p><span>“But to the extent that it can be an accelerant in our creative process, we also want to make sure that it’s a responsible tool and aligned with how we want to show up as a company,” she said. “So I feel very good in terms of the process we have in terms of vetting: is it secure, is it safe, is it values led? But I keep coming back to: I want the teams to feel safe, to explore to the extent that it drives joy in the work. And I think we have a good process, all up, in terms of making sure we’re doing it in a responsible manner.”</span></p>

 <p><span>So it sounds like, as a company, Blizzard is open to allowing its developers to use AI if they want to, though Faries didn’t get more specific about the parameters under which it considers its use “secure,” “safe,” or “values led.” But what about the </span><i><span>Overwatch</span></i><span> team, specifically? Game director Aaron Keller doesn’t sound like a fan. In an interview with </span><a href="https://x.com/gamespot/status/2019127667899961722"><i><span>GameSpot</span></i></a><span>, he said the </span><i><span>Overwatch </span></i><span>team wants the hero shooter to be a “handcrafted universe.”</span></p>

 <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">Overwatch 2 director Aaron Keller speaks out against adding AI-generated content to the game. <a href="https://t.co/44ZznZWiXJ">pic.twitter.com/44ZznZWiXJ</a></p> <p>— GameSpot (@GameSpot) <a href="https://twitter.com/GameSpot/status/2019127667899961722?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">February 4, 2026</a></p></blockquote>  <p><span>“We don’t want to put AI-generated content out in front of players,” Keller said. “It’s just not something that we’re comfortable doing. I know it’s a moving space, right? I don’t know where players or society’s perception of this is going to be five years or 10 years from now. So it’s not like, I don’t think that there’s ever gonna be a ‘Hey, here’s a forever policy around it,’ but that’s just where we’re at right now. We want this to feel like a handcrafted universe, and it is a handcrafted universe.”</span></p> <p><span>So it sounds like, for now, </span><i><span>Overwatch </span></i><span>won’t have genAI-created heroes, maps, or skins. These questions come after Microsoft, which acquired Activision Blizzard in 2023, has been reportedly pushing for AI use within the company. Blizzard teams, including those behind </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/overwatch-2-blizzard-team-4-union-microsoft-1851779922"><i><span>Overwatch</span></i></a> <span>and </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/diablo-4-blizzard-union-ai-layoffs-microsoft-2000621003"><i><span>Diablo</span></i></a><span>, recently unionized, with concerns about AI replacing artists being top of mind among organizers.</span></p>

 <p><i><span>Overwatch </span></i><span>is undergoing a revamp next week, </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/overwatch-2-name-change-season-21-cinematic-spotlight-2000665046"><span>dropping the </span><i><span>2 </span></i><span>from its title</span></a><span>, adding five new heroes, and restructuring its seasonal content to </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/overwatch-cinematic-doomfist-vendetta-death-reign-talon-2000665013"><span>prioritize linear storytelling</span></a><span>. </span></p>
