              <p><span>Tomorrow is </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-day-30-anniversary-go-anime-cosplay-stream-2000672824"><i><span>Pokémon</span></i><span>’s 30th anniversary</span></a><span>, and The Pokémon Company is going all out to commemorate the big date. There’s a </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-presents-where-when-to-watch-generation-10-switch-2000671968"><span>livestream tomorrow</span></a><span> to reveal upcoming projects, </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-30-anniversary-art-logos-every-pokedex-serebii-2000672767"><span>new art for all 1000+ monsters circulating social media</span></a><span>, and anniversary merchandise that includes throwbacks to the past 30 years of history. Now that we’ve seen some of that merch, y’all, I need the black-and-white Pikachu plush made to look like the little guy’s original </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-red-blue-yellow-green-review-game-boy-switch-2000671975"><span>Game Boy</span></a><span> sprite.</span></p> <p><a href="https://game.watch.impress.co.jp/docs/news/2088734.html"><i><span>Game Watch</span></i></a><span> attended an anniversary event in Japan that showcased several of the upcoming merchandise collaborations, and it’s unclear at the moment how many of these are coming stateside, but we might hear more in the next day or so when Pokémon Day actually begins. Some standouts include charms and art based on every box art from the mainline games, a line of camping equipment with the original Kanto starters on them, and the previously announced Fat Pikachu plush that harkens back to the mouse’s </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/fat-pikachu-chunkachu-pokemon-30th-plush-2000661861"><span>original round design</span></a><span>.</span></p>

 <p><span>The real winner is the pixelated Pikachu plush that carries all the distinct features the mouse had in the original games, long before it was morphed into the universal design we see today. The plush is missing the iconic yellow and red color scheme because it’s made to look like the critter’s sprite on the original Game Boy, which only displayed games in a monochrome color scheme. But it also has some features that have been phased out of the character’s design over the years, such as the colored paws and grey circle on the belly, though those elements have been retained by Raichu, its evolution. God, I shudder to think of how much that is going to cost on import and resale sites. Please come to the States, grey Pikachu. My shelf calls to you.</span></p> <p><span>You can check out </span><i><span>Game Watch</span></i><span>’s gallery to see the full line of products that were shown off, as well as some photos from the event.</span></p>

            <title><![CDATA[New Highguard Mode Nixes Looting And Ratchets Up The Action As It Hangs On For Dear Life]]></title>
            <link>https://kotaku.com/highguard-update-patch-note-mode-ps5-2000674000</link>
            <guid>1447027</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><em>Highguard</em> is changing up its menu in what could be <a href="https://kotaku.com/highguard-layoffs-dead-game-awards-live-service-2000668192">a last-ditch effort</a> to gain some traction as its player count continues to dwindle. A new mode dispenses with the looting phase entirely and will just have players raiding each others’ bases back and forth, nixing the phases that bored some players back at launch.</p> <p>Here’s <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/4128260?updates=true&amp;emclan=103582791475413365&amp;emgid=518613785064243442">Wildlight Entertainment’s description</a> of Raid Rush which goes live later today as part of the hero shooter’s latest update:</p> <div data-block="true" data-editor="66hhr" data-offset-key="dmg9h-0-0"> <blockquote> <p><span data-offset-key="dmg9h-0-0">In Raid Rush, 2 teams of 5 players will take turns attacking and defending their bases with no pesky looting phase in between.</span></p> </blockquote> </div> <div data-block="true" data-editor="66hhr" data-offset-key="8iip3-0-0"> <blockquote> <p><span data-offset-key="8iip3-0-0">Instead, select your base and use Trader Flynn to upgrade your weapons and equipment in a round based format. After each round, you’ll switch sides between attacking and defending. Your base walls and generators will be repaired, and you’ll be rewarded some Vesper to spend at the Trader, who will have different offers after every round. And don’t worry about buying armor – everyone has the same armor, and it will escalate in rarity as the rounds progress.</span></p> </blockquote> </div> <p data-offset-key="8iip3-0-0">Raid Rush will be an interesting experiment to see if <a href="https://kotaku.com/highguard-the-kotaku-review-is-it-good-free-ps5-pc-5v5-3v3-update-patch-2000664646"><em>Highguard</em></a> can be more appealing to players if they don’t have to wrap their heads around all of the map exploration, looting, and capture-the-flag mechanics in the first two thirds of each match. Personally, those are my favorite parts. One of the best things about <em>Highguard</em> are its mounts and those won’t be a part of Raid Rush at all.</p>

 <p data-offset-key="8iip3-0-0">The new update will also re-balance a few items and weapons. The Revive Amulet now gives a much smaller speed boost to the process of resurrecting fallen allies, and the Vanguard, by far the most dominant rifle in the game, has had its long-range damage taken down a notch. Similarly, the Dynasty, which has some wicked recoil, will now do increased damage to make up for the unwieldiness of it.</p> <h2 data-offset-key="8iip3-0-0"><i>Highguard</i> is hanging on by a thread</h2> <p data-offset-key="8iip3-0-0">If you play <em>Highguard</em> multiple times a week like I still do, the balance changes are good ones and the new mode will be interesting to try out, even if it’s fundamentally not what I want out of the game. But most people who gave it a shot at launch aren’t playing anymore. This week’s update is another incremental update that does little to address the lack of items and heroes the game needs to in order to feel more fully featured.</p>

 <p data-offset-key="8iip3-0-0">The game’s concurrent numbers on Steam have continued to fall off a cliff. <em>Highguard</em> started February at 15,000 concurrent players daily on PC. It’s now bobbing around just 500. The game seems to be doing better on console. Mat Piscatella shared with <em>Kotaku</em> that according to the Circana Player Engagement Tracker, <em>Highguard</em> was the 34th most played game on PS5 in the U.S. for the week ending February 14 based on weekly active users.</p>

 <p data-offset-key="8iip3-0-0">Anecdotally, I’ve never waited more than a few seconds during matchmaking on console, so despite all of the grim forecasts, it certainly <a href="https://kotaku.com/highguard-update-roadmap-servers-discord-2000670633">doesn’t feel like a dead game on console yet</a>. I would love for <em>Highguard</em> to recover somehow because, despite its shortcomings, I’ve been having a great time playing it. But games in its predicament need tons of runway or a major momentum-shifting boost, and so far <em>Highguard</em> doesn’t have either of those.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Pokémon Red And Blue: The Kotaku Retro Review]]></title>
            <link>https://kotaku.com/pokemon-red-blue-yellow-green-review-game-boy-switch-2000671975</link>
            <guid>1446985</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        <p><span>The </span><i><span>Pokémon </span></i><span>franchise has undergone so many transformations since</span><i><span> Red </span></i><span>and </span><i><span>Green </span></i><span>(</span><i><span>Red </span></i><span>and </span><i><span>Blue</span></i><span> here in the States)</span> <span>launched in 1996 that these inaugural Game Boy games now feel almost like a period piece. The 8-bit visuals and somewhat archaic mechanics date the original games, but what is most fascinating about revisiting them 30 years later is being reminded that the world of </span><i><span>Pokémon </span></i><span>has evolved just as much as any catchable critter does over the course of a playthrough.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>Those original Game Boy games feel retro nowadays not just in their pixel art graphics and chiptune sounds, but in the way that the world within the games feels like it’s in a different, earlier era than it is in modern games like </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-legends-za-review-switch-2-bugs-performance-2000637719"><i><span>Legends: Z-A</span></i></a><span> or </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-scarlet-violet-indigo-disk-dlc-review-terapagos-1851100679"><i><span>Scarlet </span></i><span>and </span><i><span>Violet</span></i></a><span>. As video games have become more advanced, the </span><i><span>Pokémon </span></i><span>universe has developed along with it. The Kanto region of </span><i><span>Blue </span></i><span>and </span><i><span>Red </span></i><span>is somewhat technologically advanced with its tiny Poké Ball gizmos capturing even massive monsters in machines, but by and large, this is the most grounded </span><i><span>Pokémon </span></i><span>has ever felt, and likely will ever feel again.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <h2>A simpler time with simpler struggles</h2> <p><span>The Pokédex you fill out with new data as you catch Pokémon hasn’t become a Rotom-possessed phone yet. The sluggish HM mechanic that requires you to teach Pokémon on your team traversal moves hasn’t been phased out in favor of simply riding monsters across large distances. And even the legendary creatures you find in the corners of its world don’t quite feel larger than life yet. It was a simpler time, one that was likely designed without any notion that it would persist for 30 years, expanding beyond a few freak experiments and urban legends into a world with a cosmic design at its center.</span></p> <p><span>Playing </span><i><span>Pokémon Red</span></i><span>, or any variation of those first-generation games, feels like opening a history text book and learning about how rough it was in the old days for those who set out on their </span><i><span>Pokémon </span></i><span>journey in the backseat of their parents’ car with the overhead lights on trying to angle their Game Boy just right. For some of us who grew up in that era, it’s an unsettling reminder that our past has become history, and only with time and by experiencing change firsthand can we learn just how much better we’ve got it now. Yeah, you can remake these games multiple times and let players journey through Kanto with a run button and colorful sprites, but there is a history here that even </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-fire-red-leaf-green-switch-pokemon-direct-price-2000671938"><i><span>FireRed </span></i><span>and </span><i><span>LeafGreen</span></i></a><span> can’t capture by putting players back in Pallet Town on a Game Boy Advance.</span></p>

 <figure id="attachment_2000671979" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000671979"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000671979">© The Pokémon Company</figcaption></figure> <p><span>Unchanged by the </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-games-best-worst-part-scarlet-violet-red-blue-1850084491"><span>decades of Pokémania that would follow</span></a><span>,</span><i><span> Red</span></i><span> and </span><i><span>Blue</span></i><span>’s unassuming nature means the world it offers up feels more mysterious, unknowable, and rewarding to uncover. In revisiting this game for the first time in over a decade, I decided to avoid checking databases like </span><i><span>Serebii</span></i><span> or </span><i><span>Bulbapedia</span></i><span> and just feel my way through it based on memory and vibes. I knew I needed to find a Pikachu in Viridian Forest before I headed out to win my eight gym badges, defeat the villainous Team Rocket, and become a regional champion, but beyond that, I tried to approach the game like I was playing it for the first time with no expectations or party-building goals, trying to recapture that same sense of discovery I felt in the ‘90s, though that’s easier said than done.</span></p>

 <p><span>30 years later, </span><i><span>Pokémon Red</span></i><span> and </span><i><span>Blue </span></i><span>are immaculately designed games that are also burdened by years of iteration that make some of their more archaic parts insufferable to go back to. You can’t run through the small towns and metropolitan cities of Kanto like you can in </span><i><span>Ruby </span></i><span>and </span><i><span>Sapphire</span></i><span>, the party-wide experience shared across your whole team of six is divided into fractions rather than universally given to every monster on your belt, and HMs, while an interesting way to make Pokémon feel like they exist beyond the simple turn-based battles they partake in, weigh down a party with mostly junk attacks that can’t be replaced and that’ll only be used outside of fights to traverse the world.</span></p>  <h2>As games have gotten better, so has the&nbsp;<em>Pokémon </em>world</h2> <p><i><span>Pokémon </span></i><span>has a weird quirk where it likes to add </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-scarlet-violet-photo-mode-selfie-roto-stick-1850834335"><span>quality-of-life updates diegetically</span></a><span>, with new features or fixes like sprinting only arriving because your character is given Running Shoes in </span><i><span>Ruby </span></i><span>and </span><i><span>Sapphire</span></i><span> so they can do more than lightly jog through tall grass where wild Pokémon reside. The series isn’t merely building better games, it’s building a better, more efficient world with each new entry. The trade-off for these quality-of-life improvements is that some of the mystique has gone away as Game Freak has repeatedly pulled back the curtain and fans have made entire subcultures based around seeing what’s under the hood. Every mystery in the </span><i><span>Pokémon </span></i><span>universe has been documented in online databases, each attack interaction has been meticulously cataloged and rolled into the competitive meta, and there’s someone out there who’s learned how to manipulate stats and is ready to tell you why your favorite Pokémon isn’t viable in a hypothetical ranked match you’re not even signed up for.</span></p>

 <p><span>To know </span><i><span>Pokémon </span></i><span>more deeply doesn’t mean to love it less, but I think most people who are </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-ken-sugimori-original-art-red-blue-gold-silver-1850352781"><span>nostalgic for old </span><i><span>Pokémon </span></i><span>games</span></a><span> are less attached to the games themselves than the adventurous wonder they sparked inside of us at a younger age. </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-red-blue-remake-logan-paul-firered-leafgreen-2000657176"><span>Fairweather fans who stopped playing </span><i><span>Pokémon </span></i><span>decades ago beg for another </span><i><span>Red </span></i><span>and </span><i><span>Blue </span></i><span>remake</span></a><span> like any adult pines for nostalgic media that beckons back to a time when the possibilities seemed endless. Even if </span><i><span>Red </span></i><span>and </span><i><span>Blue </span></i><span>are clunky by modern standards, its limitations gave you a lot of space to fill in as you journeyed through Kanto with your best friend by your side.</span></p> <figure id="attachment_2000671985" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000671985"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000671985">© The Pokémon Company</figcaption></figure> <p><span>Over 30 years, </span><i><span>Pokémon </span></i><span>has gone from the adventures you share secrets about with your friends on the playground to a corporate multimedia juggernaut propping up major esports events worldwide, and people have made entire businesses out of selling (or stealing) merchandise and cards where that once sounded like a pipe dream, the kind of thing your parents might jokingly suggest when you got a holographic card. It’s a phenomenon that has spawned over a hundred games, plenty of copycats, and over one thousand monsters. And it all began with </span><i><span>Red </span></i><span>and </span><i><span>Blue</span></i><span>, games whose seemingly timeless longevity has led to decades of iteration that makes them pretty annoying to go back to.</span></p> <p><span>Maybe you can’t go home again, but it’s important to remember where you came from. And even if there’s no turning back the clock, the foundations on which Game Freak and The Pokémon Company built an empire are still magical. Finding the Pokémon you’ve been looking for in random battles still feels special, and seeing them grow and overcome some of the toughest fights evokes feelings of pride in your furry friend and yourself for having overcome those challenges. As frustrating as HMs are, the mental image of my </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-legends-za-mega-dimension-evolution-raichu-x-2000652246"><span>Raichu</span></a><span> lighting up a dark cave with Flash as we try to find the exit makes him feel like more than just stats and a movepool for battles. Though future games would add more personalization, customization, and the ability to have your Pokémon follow you around the overworld, even in those original RPGs, Game Freak already understood that fostering connection between player and Pokémon was the secret sauce that made its games exceptional.</span></p>

 <p><i><span>Pokémon Red</span></i><span> and </span><i><span>Blue </span></i><span>are not the “peak” of the franchise as </span><a href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/genwunner"><span>genwunners</span></a><span> will have you believe, but they’re also not obsolete games only worth revisiting for the people who grew up with them. Every brick Game Freak and The Pokémon Company placed in building a decades-long legacy was on top of those first trips to Kanto. The franchise owes its longevity to the magic of </span><i><span>Red </span></i><span>and </span><i><span>Blue</span></i><span>, and even if parts of the </span><i><span>Pokémon </span></i><span>world look nothing like it anymore, there’s a reason its fundamentals are still the basis of even the series’ most experimental entries 30 years later.</span></p>      </div></div><br/><br/>https://kotaku.com/pokemon-red-blue-yellow-green-review-game-boy-switch-2000671975]]></content:encoded>
