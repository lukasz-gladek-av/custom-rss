              <p>In a suitably festive <a href="https://x.com/assassinscreed/status/1995175995670777942?s=20">Holiday-themed trailer for <i>Assassin’s Creed Shadows</i>’</a> final 2025 updates, a cute and cryptic teaser for some upcoming content briefly interrupted associate game director Simon Lemay-Comtois’ rundown of everything coming to the stealthy ninja sim. Eagle-eyed fans of the series, however, were quick to point out a few interesting tidbits, namely the presence of what looks like a pirate ship.</p> <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">Tis the season ❄️</p> <p>Free goodies will be waiting for you in your Hideout every day in December up until the 25th 🎁!<a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/AssassinsCreedShadows?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#AssassinsCreedShadows</a> <a href="https://t.co/ECo0kiD7yp">pic.twitter.com/ECo0kiD7yp</a></p> <p>— Assassin's Creed (@assassinscreed) <a href="https://twitter.com/assassinscreed/status/1995175995670777942?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 30, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <p>Pirate ships are nothing new to <i>Assassin’s Creed</i>, of course. Perhaps one of the most celebrated titles in the long-running series, <i>Assassin’s Creed IV Black Flag</i>, was all about the life of a blade-wielding pirate named Edward Kenway. A remake of the classic entry has been rumored for some time, with indications that <a href="https://kotaku.com/assassins-creed-black-flag-remake-ubisoft-sold-ai-2000646161">it might arrive sometime before spring of 2026</a>.</p>

<p>With speeds of up to 2,000 MB/s, it outperforms many other portable drives on the market, including its predecessor, the Samsung T7, which has a maximum speed of 1,000 MB/s. This makes the T9 perfect for handling large files.</p>
<p>Despite its high transfer speeds, the Samsung T9 remains impressively cool even during extended use. Thanks to its built-in Dynamic Thermal Guard, the drive efficiently manages heat, ensuring that it stays within an optimal temperature range. This means you can work on intensive tasks like video editing or large file transfers without worrying about overheating.</p>
<p>For videographers, the Samsung T9 SSD is an exceptional choice, allowing you to record directly onto the drive from compatible cameras or smartphones like the iPhone 15 Pro. It supports 4K video recording at 60 frames per second. Great for when your iPhone storage is near capacity and you don’t feel like scrolling through a decades worth of photos and video, looking for stuff to delete to make room.</p>



<h2>Strong. Solid. Stable.</h2>
<p>Built with durability in mind, the Samsung T9 can withstand the wear and tear of daily use. The drive is drop-resistant from heights of up to three meters, making it perfect for creators on the go. If you’re traveling for work or shooting in unpredictable environments, the T9 is a drive you can rely on. Plus, it comes with a generous five-year warranty, providing peace of mind in case something goes wrong.</p>
<p>If security is a concern, the T9 allows you to enable password protection. For anyone who frequently travels with their drive, it ensures your sensitive files remain secure, even if you accidentally leave the drive behind at a coffee shop or airport.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6173/">For a limited time, the Samsung T9 SSD is available at a significant discount</a>. The 1TB version is priced at just $95, while the 2TB model is available for $185, and the 4TB version is down to $299.</p>

              <p><span>As we get closer to </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-legends-za-review-switch-2-bugs-performance-2000637719"><i><span>Pokémon Legends: Z-A</span></i><span>’s</span></a> <a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-legends-za-mega-dimension-dlc-new-raichu-2000641644"><i><span>Mega Dimension </span></i><span>DLC</span></a><span> next Wednesday, December 10, Game Freak is adding another missing monster and Mega Evolution to the RPG’s roster. Thankfully, you won’t have to buy the $30 DLC to get this one, as Mewtwo and its two Mega Evolutions are coming to </span><i><span>Legends: Z-A </span></i><span>as a free Mystery Gift side mission.</span></p> <p><span>Mewtwo and its Mega Stones are available now in </span><i><span>Legends: Z-A</span></i><span>, and they’re totally free. To capture this Legendary Pokémon, you’ll have to download a new side quest through the game’s Mystery Gift feature. Open up the Link Play option in the pause menu, then click on Mystery Gift, and then the “Get via Internet” option. Here, you’ll find a new side quest called “Project M,” which will add the psychic legend to the game.&nbsp;</span></p>

  <p><span>With this addition, </span><i><span>Legends: Z-A </span></i><span>is one step closer to hopefully adding every Mega Evolution-capable Pokémon to the roster with </span><i><span>Mega Dimension</span></i><span>. As of right now, the base game has just about all of them, with around a dozen or so still missing in action. Most of these are legendary Pokémon like Mewtwo, Latios, Latias, and Rayquaza, but a few of the old starters like Blaziken, Sceptile, and Swampert are also missing in action.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><i><span>Mega Dimension </span></i><span>is also introducing several new Mega Evolutions that weren’t in the base game, including Mega Raichu X and Y. Also today, Game Freak announced Mega Lucario Z, </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-legends-za-mega-dimension-evolution-lucario-z-2000649602"><span>a new form for Lucario</span></a><span>, who previously had a Mega Evolution prior to the DLC. So it sounds like even some Pokémon who already had these superpowered transformations might be getting more. Outside of new Megas, the DLC is also introducing a roguelike mode that will </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-legends-za-mega-dimension-dlc-level-cap-100-2000641765"><span>break the series’ long-established level 100 level cap</span></a><span>.</span></p>

            <title><![CDATA[GameStop’s Pokémon Card Loot Box Program Just Led To A Record-Breaking $30,000 Trade-In]]></title>
            <link>https://kotaku.com/gamestop-power-pack-pokemon-tcg-trade-in-gengar-2000649582</link>
            <guid>1370302</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>A holographic Gengar from the Pokémon TCG set Skyridge just fetched over $30,000 at GameStop. The company is touting it as an “own” aimed at all the “<a href="https://x.com/gamestop/status/1995625203460891061/photo/1">trolls</a>” who make fun of its infamously poor trade-in values. But the record-breaking deal is really a window into the meme stock retailer’s slimy new loot box idea: trading card Power Packs.</p> <p>Pokémon cards are a giant cash cow. <a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-scalpers-tcg-gamestop-weigh-scale-lifetime-ban-2000646859">Scalpers raid GameStop</a> stores multiple times a month to buy up all the new products that the Pokémon Company can’t print fast enough. But GameStop barely makes any profit off of those sales. It can’t just print its own Pokémon cards and start selling them either. So it’s done the next best thing: It’s started opening its own packs and reselling the rarest cards as part of Power Packs, which are effectively digital slot machines.</p>

 <p>To participate, customers set up Stripe accounts (a payment processing platform), select the Power Pack they want, and then watch to see what card they get. The program is done in partnership with Professional Sports Authenticator (PSA), so all of the cards are graded and slabbed. While the average value of a pack might be $100, most cards people get will be worth less than what they paid for the virtual blind box.</p>

 <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">I was offered $30 for RDR2 8 days after it came out and my 100k reward points I had saved up for years were not restored when my auto renew membership was turned off from an update despite being a member for 15 years. Never forget <a href="https://t.co/Obq4ytTPu0">https://t.co/Obq4ytTPu0</a></p> <p>— Nathan 🗡️ (@DistantGalaxy96) <a href="https://twitter.com/DistantGalaxy96/status/1995646241313882496?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 2, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <p>GameStop promises to buy back any cards players don’t want at 90 percent of “fair market value” minus a 6 percent commission. That commission is essentially GameStop’s cut since PSA also runs its own <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/PokeInvesting/comments/1okzzky/psa_buying_back_their_own_slabs/">90 percent buyback program</a> without the fee. Some folks think <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/pkmntcgcollections/comments/1nqagls/scammy_move_by_gamestop_powerpack_please_read_if/">it’s a rip-off</a>. Supporters who are still banking on “GameStop to the moon” <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GME/comments/1mdyr9e/the_genius_buyback_system_behind_gamestops_new/">think it’s genius</a>.</p>

 <p>This new system is how one Pokémon card collector found a PSA 10 Holo Gengar worth an estimated $33,883 in their Power Pack. They decided to sell it back to GameStop for $30,494.70. It’s still listed as a Power Pack high-value card for someone else to chase now.</p>

 <h2>From GameStop to “Cardstop”</h2> <p>GameStop gets to promote the exchange as “the most valuable single trade-in ever recorded in GameStop history,” even though the amount is contractually obligated through a completely separate program than the one people use to trade-in retro games, old controllers, and last year’s <em>Madden</em> for a fraction of their original sale value.</p>

 <p>“I did get the chase card, I decided to sell it,” <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/PSAPowerPacks/comments/1pbp6wr/comment/nrtpgwd/?context=3">wrote</a> user Fredflinstone00 on the Power Pack subreddit. “I purchased (2) of the $2,500 packs, I was able to sell my cards from each pack and pulled the Gengar on the 6th pack.” They said they’re getting about $28,000 after fees, which puts them up overall after being down $4,000 before the Gengar.</p>

 <p>“I just sell the cards I don’t want and keep the ones I do want, I’ve had plenty shipped to me,” they told the community on Reddit. “With this card, the sales history is not the greatest, don’t want to risk a $10k move downwards, so I took the payout.”</p> <p>That volatility is another one of the risks with Power Packs. The Gengar in question was only selling for around $5,000 as recently as 2023, and GameStop’s estimated market value matched the <a href="https://www.pricecharting.com/game/pokemon-skyridge/gengar-h9#completed-auctions-manual-only">highest known sale</a> of the card from back in October.</p> <p>Others cash out the minute they get a chase card as well. A couple of weeks ago, Reddit user <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/SnooPies662/" aria-label="Author: SnooPies662" aria-haspopup="dialog" aria-expanded="false">SnooPies662</a> snagged a PSA 10 Blaine’s Charizard worth $13,700. “Subsidized by my gf after losing 6k total on diamonds,” they wrote. “Safe to say I’m done forever now and achieved everything I could have possibly wanted from this.”</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Pokémon Legends: Z-A Is Giving An Old Favorite A Second Mega Evolution]]></title>
            <link>https://kotaku.com/pokemon-legends-za-mega-dimension-evolution-lucario-z-2000649602</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><span>Lucario is one of Game Freak’s favorite Pokémon and has long been one of the faces for <a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-mega-evolutions-best-worst-designs-legends-z-a-2000625459">Mega Evolutions</a> since the powered-up transformations debuted in </span><i><span>Pokémon X </span></i><span>and </span><i><span>Y</span></i><span>. Now, the steel/fighting-type monster is getting another Mega form called Mega Lucario Z as part of </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-legends-za-review-switch-2-bugs-performance-2000637719"><i><span>Pokémon Legends: Z-A</span></i><span>’s</span></a> <a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-legends-za-mega-dimension-dlc-new-raichu-2000641644"><i><span>Mega Dimension </span></i></a><span>DLC.</span></p>  <p><a href="https://legends.pokemon.com/en-us/news/mega_lucario_z"><span>According to the official </span><i><span>Legends Z-A</span></i><span> website</span></a><span>, these Mega Evolution Z forms will play a little differently than their standard transformations, as they will have shorter cooldown times for their attacks, but use more of the Mega Gauge that lets them sustain their transformations. They hit faster, but use fewer moves before reverting to their original forms, so Game Freak says they’re less suited for longer battles.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><span>Mega Lucario Z doesn’t change the Pokémon’s steel/fighting typing, so it will be interesting to see how it differentiates itself from the original Mega Lucario in the competitive space. The fact that Z forms have their own special mechanic makes it sound like other Pokémon will be getting these alternate forms. This lines up with some of the <a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-legends-za-mega-dimension-dlc-new-evolutions-2000641670">datamined leaks from earlier this year</a> that claim Absol and Garchomp are also getting these new transformations in </span><i><span>Mega Dimension</span></i><span>.</span></p> <p><span>Lucario isn’t the only old favorite getting a new Mega Evolution in </span><i><span>Legends: Z-A</span></i><span>’s DLC, which is also adding two forms for Raichu, and new transformations for Chimecho, Baxcalibur, and <a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-legends-z-a-mega-zeraora-reaction-industry-plant-2000645789">Zeraora</a>. Outside of new Megas, the expansion is also adding a roguelike mode that will <a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-legends-za-mega-dimension-dlc-level-cap-100-2000641765">break the series’ original level 100 cap</a>, so it could be one of the biggest challenges these games have offered to date. It does seem to take place <a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-legends-za-korrina-lucario-az-galar-how-to-get-2000639831">after the events of the main game</a>, though, so if you haven’t beaten <em>Legends: Z-A </em>yet, you might want to lock in. The expansion will launch next week on December 10.</span></p>
