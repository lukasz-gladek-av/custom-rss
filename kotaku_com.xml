The mode,  currently labeled as being in “Early Access,” is rough around the edges and feels more like a demo than a full game. However, <em>Ballistic </em>is also proof that Epic can build first-person shooters that work in <em>Fortnite, </em>and that’s exciting.</p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="196395" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="The Week In Games: Co-Op Bug Blasting And More New Releases" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="80" data-playlist="196395,195301,196539" data-current="196395"><div><p>The Week In Games: Co-Op Bug Blasting And More New Releases</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196395/196395_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196395/196395_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196395/196395_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196395/196395_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/21945.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.fortnite.com/news/fortnite-goes-first-person-with-ballistic-a-tactical-5v5-shooter-launching-in-early-access-dec-11?sessionInvalidated=true&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.fortnite.com/news/fortnite-goes-first-person-with-ballistic-a-tactical-5v5-shooter-launching-in-early-access-dec-11?sessionInvalidated=true" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Launched on December 11 on all platforms</a></span>, <em>Ballistic </em>is a 5v5 tactical round-based first-person shooter in which one team defends two bomb sites while the other team of five attacks and tries to plant an explosive device. There are no respawns until the next round and between rounds, you buy guns and equipment with money you earn from kills and winning.</p><p> That probably sounds a lot like <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/dust-2-new-crate-boost-update-counter-strike-2-valve-1851602614?_gl=1*1luxzsp*_ga*NzE0NzM5NTc5LjE3Mjk4Njg5MzU.*_ga_V4QNJTT5L0*MTczMzk1MjM5NC45Ni4xLjE3MzM5NTQ2OTMuMTQuMC4w&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/dust-2-new-crate-boost-update-counter-strike-2-valve-1851602614?_gl=1*1luxzsp*_ga*NzE0NzM5NTc5LjE3Mjk4Njg5MzU.*_ga_V4QNJTT5L0*MTczMzk1MjM5NC45Ni4xLjE3MzM5NTQ2OTMuMTQuMC4w"><em>Counter-Strike</em></a></span><em>&nbsp;</em>and that’s because, yeah, <em>Ballistic </em>is basically <em>Fortnite</em>’s<em> </em>version of Valve’s popular FPS. </p><p>Before I played a few matches, I was curious how well FPS gameplay would work in <em>Fortnite</em>. After a few matches of <em>Ballistic</em>, I came away impressed. Epic has done the work to make animations and movement feel and look good in the first-person perspective. Sprinting, climbing, aiming down sights, reloading, and all that feels snappy and responsive, like you’d expect from a well-made first-person shooter. </p><p>I do have some quibbles with the controls. I really want a button that lets me swap between my rifle and pistol. I’d love to be able to map my grenade and gadgets to specific buttons, too, instead of using <em>Fortnite</em>’s default inventory and hotbar system. But these are minor issues that could be fixed in future updates. For now, what’s here is a solid FPS that just happens to live in <em>Fortnite </em>and uses all the character and weapon skins you already own. </p><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/dragon-ball-z-goku-fortnite-vegeta-anime-update-dbz-1849420484?_gl=1*14um7a4*_ga*MzQzNjkwNDM2LjE2NDY2NjQ1NzQ.*_ga_V4QNJTT5L0*MTczMzk0NzY1My4xMTQuMS4xNzMzOTQ3ODg5LjQyLjAuMA..&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/dragon-ball-z-goku-fortnite-vegeta-anime-update-dbz-1849420484?_gl=1*14um7a4*_ga*MzQzNjkwNDM2LjE2NDY2NjQ1NzQ.*_ga_V4QNJTT5L0*MTczMzk0NzY1My4xMTQuMS4xNzMzOTQ3ODg5LjQyLjAuMA..">Yes, that means Darth Vader can snipe Goku</a></span> while Leatherface helps Snoop Dogg plant the bomb at location A. Weird shit, but it also is a big selling point to someone like me who owns all these characters (and more).</p><figure id="" data-id="f0b990a131e6b12dc77f87d9265849ce" data-recommend-id="image://f0b990a131e6b12dc77f87d9265849ce" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A screenshot of Ballistic shows a player holding an SMG." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A screenshot of Ballistic shows a player holding an SMG." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Epic Games / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="f0b990a131e6b12dc77f87d9265849ce" data-recommend-id="image://f0b990a131e6b12dc77f87d9265849ce" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A screenshot of Ballistic shows a player holding an SMG." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>As for the mode itself, <em>Ballistic </em>is fun and tense, like <em>Counter-Strike</em> or <em>Valorant</em>. However, I experienced some issues with menus not loading properly, random sound effects happening for no reason, long waits between matches, and janky post-game victory screens. While I had a good time taking out <em>Fortnite </em>kiddies who have never played a game like <em>Counter-Strike</em>, I understand why Epic labeled this an “Early Access” experiment. It’s enjoyable, but far from finished or stable.</p><p>Still, even in this janky, early access form, Epic’s latest mode is a promising first step toward the developer adding more FPS modes and games into <em>Fortnite</em>. </p><p>Epic has also, with the launch of <em>Ballistic</em>, given the community the ability to start publicly uploading games using the company’s FPS tools.  I expect that in the coming days and weeks, we’ll see people recreating famous <em>Counter-Strike</em> maps and more. That sounds exciting, though if I was someone working on a first-person shooter that wasn’t <em>Call of Duty</em>, I’d be nervous. </p><p>If Epic can build upon <em>Ballistic </em>and add more modes, games, and options, it might be able to bring a whole new audience into its <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/gta-6-lego-fortnite-brick-life-roleplay-ps5-xbox-pc-1851716667&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/gta-6-lego-fortnite-brick-life-roleplay-ps5-xbox-pc-1851716667">ever-growing ecosystem</a></span>, and it might get even tougher than it already is to launch a multiplayer shooter. </p><p> .</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

According to Max’s synopsis of the season, “Harley and Ivy discover that something sinister is at play” in Metropolis when they arrive, and they can count Lex Luthor (Giancarlo Esposito) and his sister Lena Luthor (Aisha Tyler) as threats, along with Brainiac. </p><p>This season is set to premiere on January 16, 2025, and comes after Harley Quinn’s pocket of the DC animated universe expanded this year with its first spin-off series, <em>Kite Man: Hell Yeah!</em> The show features the comedic, endearingly ill-fortuned character who, on <em>Harley Quinn</em>, was the title character’s ex-fiance and is voiced by <em>Fresh Off The Boat</em>’s Matt Oberg.<em>&nbsp;</em>In a November interview with <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://screenrant.com/creature-commandos-season-1-showrunner-dean-lorey-interview/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://screenrant.com/creature-commandos-season-1-showrunner-dean-lorey-interview/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>ScreenRant</em></a></span><em>, </em>executive producer and writer Dean Lorey hinted at another possible spin-off from what he calls the Harleyverse:</p><p>“Well, I’m all in on the Harleyverse.
