              <p><em>Marathon</em> might be the <a href="https://kotaku.com/marathon-shooter-best-vibrant-colorful-bungie-trailer-1850481359">most visually striking game Bungie’s ever made</a>, and the art director overseeing it won’t be there when the game ships. <em>Kotaku</em> has learned that veteran artist Joseph Cross recently decided to depart the studio. The move comes just months ahead of the extraction shooter’s new March 2026 release date.</p> <p>Evidence of Cross’ departure was first spotted earlier today <a href="https://thegamepost.com/bungie-joseph-cross-stepped-down-marathon-franchise-art-director/">by <em>The Game Post</em></a>. His LinkedIn profile was recently updated to give his senior art director position at Bungie an end date of 2025, and his account on X no longer references the studio at all. He was a <a href="https://www.bungie.net/7/en/News/article/10263/7_Breaking-In---Joe-Cross">lead concept artist at Bungie</a> throughout the <em>Destiny</em> years and returned to the studio around 2020 to help shape the aesthetic for <em>Marathon</em>, the company’s newest multiplayer shooter.</p>

 <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">Marathon Art Style (a short thread). First of all thanks to everyone for all the kind words and enthusiasm for the art style/direction in our announce trailer, it's been amazing to see. This was the result of many talented artists working together, with the support of an amazing <a href="https://t.co/ePPi41KA6c">pic.twitter.com/ePPi41KA6c</a></p> <p>— Joseph Cross (@josephacross) <a href="https://twitter.com/josephacross/status/1663415929043296257?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">May 30, 2023</a></p></blockquote>  <p>Cross told&nbsp;<em>Kotaku</em> that it was his decision to leave. “I’m super proud of the project and what the team accomplished over the last six years,” he said. He also recently shared a clip on X from <a href="https://kotaku.com/marathon-release-date-price-battle-pass-proximity-chat-2000653472">Bungie’s latest ViDoc showing how <em>Marathon </em>has evolved</a> following its delay after negative fan feedback from an alpha test earlier in the year.</p>

 <p>A number of tweaks were made to the extraction shooter, including adding proximity chat, a feature that’s become a cornerstone of breakout hit <em>Arc Raiders</em>. Originally set to launch back in September, <em>Marathon</em> is now coming early next year.</p> <p>The delay also followed fallout <a href="https://kotaku.com/marathon-bungie-art-alpha-gameplay-posters-antireal-1851780911">around allegations</a> that some visual decals in the game had been lifted from someone outside the studio. “[The] <i>Marathon</i> art issue has been resolved with Bungie and Sony Interactive Entertainment to my satisfaction,” <a href="https://kotaku.com/marathon-bungie-antireal-art-plagiarism-extraction-2000649685">the artist announced</a> earlier this month.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>At a hotel in China that reportedly specializes in catering to gamers and esports competitors, staff claim to have found a disgusting mess left behind by a man who stayed there for two years.</p> <p><a href="https://www.the-sun.com/news/15653824/grim-video-hotel-guest-leaves-room-stomach-churning-mess/">As first reported by <em>The Sun</em></a> and then spotted by <a href="https://www.dexerto.com/entertainment/guest-from-hell-leaves-hotel-room-a-disgusting-mess-after-two-year-gaming-marathon-3296126/"><em>Dexerto</em></a>, a man believed to be an avid gamer checked out of his hotel room after two years. And during that time, it seems no cleaning staff had ever been allowed in because when employees entered the room, they discovered mountains of trash and a disgusting toilet surrounded by used toilet paper. <em>The Sun</em> reports that staff called the man a “guest from Hell.”</p> <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">Grim vid shows hotel guest from hell leave room in stomach-churning state <a href="https://t.co/GwT0sWJo2d">pic.twitter.com/GwT0sWJo2d</a></p> <p>— The Sun (@TheSun) <a href="https://twitter.com/TheSun/status/2001548703564226963?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 18, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <p>Staff say a thick layer of brown grime had built up on the floor in the hotel room, and the gamer’s sparse furniture was buried in trash that, in some areas, was nearly three feet deep. During his two-year stint in the hotel, employees claim he rarely left the room, with staff telling the outlet that many didn’t know what he looked like because he spent so much time in his disgusting little gamer hole.</p>

 <p><em>The Sun’s</em> report sharing the details and photos of the hard-to-look-at hotel room mess doesn’t provide too many specific details about the location, the guest, or precisely when this happened. But I’ll never forget where I was when I first laid eyes on that toilet.</p> <p>It reportedly took three days to clean out the hotel room after the man left, and it will take more renovations and repairs to make the place rentable once more. The guest apparently still owes 10 days’ worth of fees, amounting to around $400. So the next time you look at your gamer room and feel gross about an empty can or a leftover wrapper, you can at least remind yourself that you aren’t as bad as the person behind this awful gamer-related hotel disaster. But still, pick that crap up.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><i><span>Fortnite</span></i><span>’s crossover slop has now spread to engulf the Wizarding World as Epic’s inescapable battle royale is gearing up to add cosmetics based on </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/hogwarts-legacy-review-harry-potter-rowling-transphobia-1850127849"><i><span>Harry Potter</span></i></a><span>. The game has become such a worldwide phenomenon that there are plenty of leak accounts on social media routinely posting about upcoming collaborations, but the account that leaked the </span><i><span>Harry Potter </span></i><span>skins had a different motive than simply informing people, as they have stated they “spoiled” the surprise in protest of it inclusion because of </span><i><span>Harry Potter </span></i><span>author J.K. Rowling’s transphobic rhetoric.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>Rowling has been a vocal figurehead in the fight against trans rights </span><a href="https://theweek.com/feature/1020838/jk-rowlings-transphobia-controversy-a-complete-timeline"><span>over the past few years</span></a><span>, and it’s made buying and supporting </span><i><span>Harry Potter </span></i><span>and its various movies, video games, and spin-offs harder for fans and trans supporters, though it hasn’t stopped </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/hogwarts-legacy-harry-potter-slytherin-house-jk-rowling-1850305177"><i><span>Hogwarts Legacy</span></i></a> <span>from racking up over </span><a href="https://x.com/HogwartsLegacy/status/2001336625847243153"><span>40 million sales</span></a><span> since its launch in 2023.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><span>So when it was confirmed that </span><i><span>Harry Potter </span></i><span>content was coming to </span><i><span>Fortnite</span></i><span>, some fans of both </span><i><span>Harry Potter </span></i><span>and </span><i><span>Fortnite</span></i><span> had to wrestle with whether or not they want to support the crossover, or the game more broadly. Fortnite Underground, a </span><i><span>Fortnite </span></i><span>leaker who </span><a href="https://x.com/FNBRunderground/status/2000583138209100108?s=20"><span>leaked the </span><i><span>Harry Potter </span></i><span>collaboration</span></a><span>, has posted a lengthy explanation on X about why they chose to post about it ahead of its official announcement, saying they wanted to “ruin” the surprise in an act of protest and that </span><i><span>Fortnite </span></i><span>once “stood for what was right.”</span></p>

 <p><span>“Most people won’t care,” they wrote. “These Outfits will probably sell pretty well, most people will be happy to see one of their favorite childhood franchises come to the game, and Epic Games and J.K. Rowling will make plenty of money.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><span>But I’m not okay with that, and I hope you’re not okay with it either.”</span></p> <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">Opinion – I was the leaker who spoiled Harry Potter coming to <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/Fortnite?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#Fortnite</a>. Here's why ⬇️ </p> <p>Last year, Harry Potter creator J.K. Rowling claimed that Imane Khelif, a female boxer, was actually born as a man. There's just one issue: they weren't. There's been a sentiment around this… <a href="https://t.co/tzKv18jYeK">pic.twitter.com/tzKv18jYeK</a></p> <p>— Fortnite Underground (@FNBRunderground) <a href="https://twitter.com/FNBRunderground/status/2001447614466691338?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 18, 2025</a></p></blockquote>   <p><span>Fortnite Underground signs off saying they wanted to spoil the collaboration in hopes that “less people would buy it,” but many of the responses argue that any kind of discussion promotes it in some way. Maybe their bringing attention to Rowling’s views could start some much-needed conversations in the </span><i><span>Fortnite</span></i><span> community, though you also have a bunch of transphobic nonsense in the replies, with people claiming they’ll buy the </span><i><span>Harry Potter </span></i><span>cosmetics as a counter protest. Do yourself a favor and avoid the responses to their post.</span></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>The developer behind the slot machine-based indie game <em>Luck Be a Landlord</em> has asked fans not to buy it on Xbox, and instead told <em>Kotaku</em> he wants people to<a href="https://kotaku.com/no-games-for-genocide-xbox-microsoft-boycott-palestine-2000650175"> boycott Microsoft due to the company continuing to support Israel</a> in its violent attacks against Palestine and its people.</p> <p>On December 18, <em>Luck Be a Landlord</em> creator Dan DiIorio <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/did:plc:n52jsewxgg2zp65ggprctppx/post/3mabikxrjz22q?ref_src=embed&amp;ref_url=https%253A%252F%252Fkotaku.com%252Fwp%252Fwp-admin%252Fpost.php">reshared a post</a> about investigative games reporting outlet <em>People Make Games</em> boycotting Xbox due to its involvement in the Israel-Palestine conflict. The dev further added that he didn’t want people to buy the slot machine game on Xbox.</p>

 <p>“Please do not purchase<em> Luck Be a Landlord</em> on Xbox,” posted DiIorio. “I will be making a $10,000 donation to The Palestine Children’s Relief Fund to (hopefully) help offset the revenue the game has generated for Microsoft.”</p>   <p>Originally released in 2023, <em>Luck Be a Landlord</em> is a roguelike slot machine game that helped inspire the creation of <em>Balatro</em>. In the game, players try to pay their rent using a slot machine that can be upgraded and tweaked. <em>Luck Be a Landlord</em> first launched in 2023 on PC but was ported to consoles earlier this year.</p> <div id=":5b"> <p>“I would love for everyone to give what they can to <a href="https://nogamesforgenocide.com/">The Palestine Children’s Relief Fund</a>, whether they purchased the game on Xbox or not,” DiIorio told <em>Kotaku</em> via email.&nbsp; “I also encourage those with Game Pass subscriptions to cancel them.”</p> <p>DiIorio isn’t the first indie developer to publicly distance themselves from Xbox and vocally support the ongoing and growing boycott against the company. In April, the developers behind <em>Tenderfoot Tactics&nbsp;</em>pulled the game from the Xbox store in solidarity with the BDS campaign against Israel.</p> <p>“We hope that Microsoft will listen to the voices of their workers and customers and stop all business with the criminal Israeli military, which we have watched conduct an open genocide in Gaza over the last 18 months,” said one developer at the time on social media <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/indie-developer-removes-their-game-from-xbox-stores-in-solidarity-with-pro-palestine-boycott">as reported by <em>Rock, Paper, Shotgun.</em></a><em>&nbsp;</em>The boycott against Israel has continued to cause problems for Xbox and will likely do so moving forward into 2026.</p> </div>

            <title><![CDATA[Naughty Dog Is Reportedly Crunching Again For Intergalactic, Despite Planned 2027 Release]]></title>
            <link>https://kotaku.com/intergalactic-heretic-prophet-naughty-dog-crunch-trailer-2000654650</link>
            <guid>1387636</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><span>Last year, </span><i><span>The Last of Us </span></i><span>developer Naughty Dog released a </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/last-of-us-part-2-grounded-making-of-documentary-1851196816"><span>documentary on the making of the game’s 2020 sequel</span></a><span> that attempted to discuss the studio’s reported problems with overwork and crunch. The video ended on a note indicating that things had improved, but it sounds like the team is facing a similar struggle with its upcoming PS5 game </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/intergalactic-heretic-prophet-last-of-us-naughty-dog-1851721022"><i><span>Intergalactic: The Heretic Prophet</span></i></a><span>.</span></p> <p><a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-12-18/sony-s-naughty-dog-studio-orders-employee-overtime-on-intergalactic"><i><span>Bloomberg</span></i></a><span> reports that Naughty Dog has had developers working mandatory overtime as it races to complete a demo of the sci-fi action game for Sony to review, despite a planned release date that’s still years away.</span></p> <p><span>The mandatory overtime reportedly began in October, with staff being asked to work a minimum of eight extra hours a week and logging them on an internal spreadsheet. This was in an effort to get the game’s production back on track after several missed deadlines, though developers were also told not to work more than 60 hours a week.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><span>During this period, a new mandatory return-to-office order was also pushed through, requiring everyone to be onsite at the Santa Monica studio five days a week, rather than the typical three. According to </span><i><span>Bloomberg</span></i><span>’s sources, employees had to find “alternative care arrangements” for children and pets.</span></p>

 <p><span>This follows older reports that Naughty Dog had hired a new team of producers specifically meant to help alleviate the team’s crunch problems. But according to </span><i><span>Bloomberg</span></i><span>, several of them have already left the company. While select members of the team reportedly worked overtime to finish </span><i><span>Intergalactic</span></i><span>’s debut trailer back in 2024, this new overtime requirement has applied to “most” of the staff.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><span>Management reportedly told workers the company will return to its usual three-day in-office requirement in January, with a more detailed breakdown coming after the team returns from holiday break. The </span><i><span>Bloomberg</span></i><span> story signs off with an ironic anecdote, saying the team was given metal coins to commemorate the game’s ongoing development, which included text of a quote from the game, “The suffering of generations must be endured to achieve our divine end.”</span></p> <p><span>Reports of Naughty Dog crunching date back years, with </span><i><span>The Last of Us Part II</span></i><span>’s development being </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/as-naughty-dog-crunches-on-the-last-of-us-ii-developer-1842289962"><span>one of the most notorious</span></a><span>. Back in 2023, Naughty Dog </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/naughty-dog-ps5-playstation-sony-last-us-part-3-layoffs-1850893794"><span>cut dozens of contractors</span></a><span> roughly a year before </span><i><span>Intergalactic </span></i><span>was announced at the 2024 Game Awards.</span></p>

              <p>Developer Mark Ffrench has carved out something of a unique niche on Steam, regularly releasing fill-a-pix logic puzzle games of enormous scale and surprising depth. Among others in 2024 there was <a href="https://buried-treasure.org/2024/11/proverbs/"><em>Proverbs</em></a>, a wall-sized puzzle based on Pieter Bruegel the Elder’s painting Netherlandish Proverbs, and <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3380760/2024_Mosaic_Retrospective/"><em>2024: Mosaic Retrospective</em></a>, which contained dozens of interlocking images recalling major events from the whole year. Following&nbsp;<a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3444650/Mosaic_of_the_Strange/"><em>Mosaic of the Pharaohs</em></a> earlier this year, we now have the most elaborate entry yet:&nbsp;<a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3444650/Mosaic_of_the_Strange/"><em>Mosaic of the Strange</em></a>—a game that combines the same logic puzzle conceit with a pixelated point-n-click adventure.</p> <p>Right, describing a logic puzzle is always the most stultifying and joy-destroying process, so please bear with me for a moment before we get back to the fun stuff:</p> <p>To get everyone on the same page, fill-a-pix is one of the many logic puzzle types to come from puzzle maestros <a href="https://www.conceptispuzzles.com/index.aspx">Conceptis</a>, where you fill in a grid based on&nbsp;<em>Minesweeper</em> rules. Each number in the grid indicates the number of cells that should be shaded in the three-by-three grid of which it sits in the center. So, a “6” on the side of a puzzle means all six cells are shaded, while a “0” in the middle means you can eliminate its nine cells from any overlapping clues. The more you play, the more familiar you become with certain patterns, such as the consequences of having a “6” and a “3” in two adjacent cells (you have to shade the three cells to the left of the 6, and eliminate the three to the right of the 3), and so many more besides. RIGHT, OK, WE’RE DONE.</p>

  <p>The way Ffrench implements this is by creating enormous mosaics that are segmented into individual puzzles, and rewarding completion of most with little pop-up information. In&nbsp;<em>Proverbs</em> it was details on each of the proverbs depicted in the vast painting. In&nbsp;<em>2024</em> it was details of the events of that year. But in&nbsp;<em>Mosaic of the Strange</em>, it’s all rather different. The details that pop up are documents, mostly about conspiratorial mysteries, because in this game you’re playing as FBI agents investigating a murder.</p>

 <p>Agents Cullen and Brady are called in after a body is found in gruesome condition, with the circumstances of the man’s death a crazed muddle of mysteries. And rather than solving multiple puzzles on a single wall, here the process of completing the grids is how you’re exploring the items in the rooms. OK, yes, it’s spurious. You’re not actually playing a point-n-click in the sense that you’re actually deducing anything, but with each item solved you gain a document pertaining to a peculiar subject, perhaps cryptids or UFOs or mysterious disappearances from lonely lighthouses, which all add up to evidence to stick up on the pinboard in your office. You also visit the coroner, the murder victim’s apartment, and elsewhere, with a total of 144 puzzles and documents to find.</p>

 <p>Various items prompt conversations between the characters, which makes what would otherwise be a more sterile puzzle game feel much more alive and in-depth, and the result is something absorbing both in narrative and in puzzling. Ffrench has nailed the way in which he delivers the challenges, with smart, context-sensitive hints if you want them, and a prompt that will pop up if you’ve gone too horribly wrong without noticing. Also, in this game, you can hugely change the difficulty of the puzzles in a way that I adore.</p>

 <figure id="attachment_2000654620" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000654620"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000654620">© Mark Ffrench / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p>You can make things so simple that you’re basically painting by numbers, or in increments make it so challenging that every puzzle is a head-scratching ordeal on the scale of <a href="https://buried-treasure.org/2020/02/tametsi/"><em>Tametsi</em></a>. I’ve mostly settled on one notch down from the latter, but it’s fun to scale it up to the hardest point and really have to scour for every super-complex pattern of numbers. Even better, you can change that difficulty at any point, midway through solving any grid.</p> <p>OK, I completely nerded out there, but trust me, you’ve never played anything like&nbsp;<a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3444650/Mosaic_of_the_Strange/"><em>Mosaic of the Strange</em></a>, and you’ll get&nbsp;<em>hours</em> of entertainment for your $12. I can’t wait to see what Ffrench does next, especially if these games continue to evolve in their current direction.</p>
