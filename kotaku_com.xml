            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Skateboarding games are a hell of a good time and EA’s recent <i>skate</i>, the free-to-play title aiming to reboot EA’s once-cherished series, is trying to lure folks back into the thrills of digital ollies and kickflips. And because it’s a free-to-play game from a AAA publisher in 2025, it’s got microtransactions and seasons and all that stuff. While we mostly tolerate this silliness in games nowadays, some stuff is just too expensive and too ugly to pass without comment.</p> <p>Instead of throwing money at the screen for a skin of space zombie-stomper Isaac Clarke from <i>Dead Space</i>, fans of <i>skate</i> have taken to the internet to throw shade at the developers for selling such an ugly version of Clarke for $35 bucks (h/t <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/dead-space-fans-slam-35-isaac-clarke-costume-in-eas-new-skate/1100-6535310/">comrade Pitts at <i>GameSpot</i></a>). That’s like, a whole meal at Taco Bell these days (with maybe a drink if you’re lucky). It’s also the price of many full, complete games you can play from start to finish. That’s probably what’s left folks so sore: <i>skate</i>. Is the type of game you could once plunk down a moderate sum for and be done with it, but is now yet another nagging wallet leech trying to bank on your nostalgia.</p>

 <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">You can buy 3 Dead Sapce games with that money  (and probably 3 Skate games)</p> <p>— Diogo Rodrigues (@Rodrigues_520) <a href="https://twitter.com/Rodrigues_520/status/1975629911059800416?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 7, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <p>The situation reminds us just how far we’ve come from an era of gaming that felt more respectful of our time and money. One fan over on r/SkateEA points out that 2010’s <i>Skate 3</i> had an Isaac Clarke skin–but it was free and seemed more faithful to the character’s appearance in the original game.</p>

    <p>It’s a real shame as <i>skate</i> looks like a good time otherwise, full of all of the crazy stuff we’ll never be able to do in real life on a skateboard.</p>   <p>And as another fan on Reddit opines, the game’s battle pass (skate pass?) just contains “ugly accessories and clothing along with phoned in feeling graphics for decks” instead of stuff from actual skate brands. And if ever there was an industry that was ripe for having its aesthetics&nbsp; cut up and sold in little bits, it’s the skateboard industry. With its various legendary designs, from the <a href="https://www.birdhouseskateboards.com/">epic birds of Birdhouse Skateboards</a> to the gorgeous artwork found on your average <a href="https://www.elementbrand.lu/skateboards/">Element board</a> (which used to my brand of choice back in the day), there’s a ton of cool designs that could be packaged into the game as a fitting tribute to the industry. I’d still be annoyed if those cost $35 a piece, but at least they’d feel a little more relevant.</p>  <p>C’mon, EA.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Doja Cat is coming to <a href="https://kotaku.com/kpop-demon-hunters-fortnite-rei-ami-stream-zoey-rumi-2000632536">Fortnite’s 2025 Halloween event</a> and the battle royale tried to get players hyped by letting R&amp;B’s “Queen of Memes” take over the <em>Fortnite</em> X account on Wednesday. It didn’t take long for that piece of online performance art to blow up after the account tweeted what seemed like an obvious allusion to sex toys and Doja Cat denied being behind it. “Shit cringe as fuck now I’m embarrassed,” she wrote back.</p> <p>The<em> Fortnite</em> X account had Doja Cat’s in-game face as its avatar when it posted “mother of rose toys,” which many fans immediately took to mean sex toys. “Oh damn the sex update is real!!” one joked <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/FortNiteBR/comments/1o1jdub/mother_of_rose_toys/">on the subreddit</a>. But Doja Cat immediately distanced herself from the whole thing and the post was taken down. People didn’t believe her at first. “I told them not to man that’s not even me,” she wrote. “I said this yesterday and then said ‘don’t post that’ :/.”</p> <p> <figure id="attachment_2000633342" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000633342"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000633342">X</figcaption></figure> </p> <p>The internet-savvy artist has a history of trolling and back-handed marketing endorsements, as <a href="http://he internet-savvy artist known for trolling"><em>Polygon</em> points out</a>. So many are left wondering whether this was an actual brand activation gone bad or part of some elaborate 4D poster chess to get people talking and arguing about what is, at the end of the day, a microtransaction-filled in-game event aimed at getting players to empty their virtual wallets on overpriced skins. Is the modern media landscape so cynical as to desperately gin up a non-troversy just to pad the quarterly sales figures?</p> <p>Some folks are genuinely surprised that a game largely aimed at children would go anywhere near sexual entendres, even if the whole thing really is just a social media fake-out on page seven of the <em>Fortnite</em> Halloween 2025 marketing deck. With the culture already primed to lash out at any online gaming-adjacent micro-scandal, it does seem a bit far-fetched that Epic Games would willingly ignite a whole discourse cycle around “<em>Fortnite</em> sex toys.”</p> <p>After all, it only just got done making sure there weren’t any accidental Nazi allusions in its latest <a href="https://kotaku.com/peacemaker-s2-fortnite-dance-nazi-swastika-refund-2000630714"><em>Peacemaker</em> emote</a> following some late season-2 twists. It’s due back tomorrow with a “modified” animation that will apparently remove any possibility of it accidentally conjuring a swastika. Then again, Epic didn’t seem too worried about Darth Vader, voiced by AI James Earl Jones, <a href="https://kotaku.com/fortnite-star-wars-ai-darth-vader-james-earl-jones-1851781018">saying racist stuff and cursing at players,</a> so who can say?</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><a href="https://aftermath.site/tim-sweeney-epic-ceo-elon-musk-brainworms">Tim Sweeney</a>, CEO of Epic Games, thinks that automated chatbots can be used to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/fortnite-boss-makes-a-bold-claim-about-ai-in-video-games/1100-6532073/">enrich games with auto-generated dialogue</a>. But what he and his company don’t like, however, is the end user using bots to bring false life to lifeless server rooms so that user-created maps can earn money even if nobody’s actually playing them.</p> <p>Two Michigan-based <i>Fortnite</i> creators, Idris Nahdi and Ayob Nasser, are at the center of a lawsuit filed by Epic Games that alleges they created 20,000 bots to falsely inflate the popularity of their maps (h/t <a href="https://www.polygon.com/epic-games-fortnite-creative-bot-lawsuit-uefn-idris-nahdi-ayob-nasser/">comrade Hernandez at <i>Polygon</i></a>). And they weren’t just doing it because they were lonely and wanted thousands of bot friends. Generating engagement on <i>Fortnite </i>maps is akin to printing money, as <i>Fortnite</i>’s “Island Creator” program sees folks earn real cash for making genuinely cool stuff that appeals to genuine people. Create a cool island that attracts loads of players, and Epic will make it worth your while.</p>

 <p>But alas, we live in a society with “rules.” And one of <i>Fortnite</i>’s creator program rules is that engagement is measured by real people playing the game. This is in addition to some pretty <a href="https://kotaku.com/fortnite-uefn-call-of-duty-dmca-creator-copyright-1850299456">strict rules about intellectual property</a>.</p> <p>Epic Games alleges that the defendants were intentionally trying to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/shorts/DAltzrgrMn8">circumvent</a> the program’s terms of service, having bots flood their islands “using a cloud gaming service that allows users to play video games, like <i>Fortnite</i>, remotely.”</p>

 <p>If true, it’s a computer abuse scheme that went on to earn the defendants tens of thousands of dollars. But Epic eventually caught on, cut them off and ordered the duo to stop playing the game and “destroy all copies of <i>Fortnite</i>” they currently had. The two apparently didn’t listen and continued playing <i>Fortnite</i>, and so now Epic is escalating things, alleging that:</p>

 <p>Defendants’ conduct undermines Epic’s relationship with developers,…depriving legitimate developers of the full share of funds they otherwise would have received and eroding the trust Epic has built with them.</p> <p>Epic Games is seeking financial recuperation, but also wants to ban not only these players but also their entire bloodlines from ever playing <i>Fortnite</i> again. No, I’m not being snarky and for once in my life it seems that I don’t need to be: The lawsuit literally wants to ban Nahdi and Ayob Nasser and their “heirs [and] successors” from playing <i>Fortnite</i>.</p> <p>Rational behavior from rational people.</p>

              <p>Unlike Microsoft, it’s hard to see Nintendo ever bringing its games to PlayStation 5. Someone’s taking advantage of that fact with a store listing for a seemingly fake game that looks an awful lot like <a href="https://kotaku.com/animal-crossing-new-horizons-the-kotaku-review-1842321314"><em>Animal Crossing: New Horizons</em></a>. It’s called<em> Anime Village Online</em>, and that’s probably the most distinct thing about it.</p> <p>A <a href="https://store.playstation.com/en-gb/concept/10017289">recently discovered store listing</a> for the game shows what looks like a human Villager from <em>Animal Crossing</em> jumping into the air beneath a blue sky. The description for <em>Anime Village Online</em> reads like a summary of everything the Nintendo franchise is best known for. “Design and expand your own charming house, craft furniture, grow crops, catch fish, and decorate your surroundings to match your personal style,” it reads. “Wander through beautiful forests, rivers, beaches, and hidden paths. Discover resources, meet NPC villagers, and unlock new items and areas as you play.”</p>

   <p><em>Anime Village Online</em> will allegedly feature cross-platform multiplayer and arrive sometime in 2027. Who’s making it? The developer is listed as Wisnu Sudirman. According to a LinkedIn page bearing the same name, that person is a recent graduate who lives in Indonesia. <em>Anime Village Online</em> isn’t their only hustle either. They’re also apparently making a game called <em>Rooted: Survival</em>,&nbsp;<a href="https://x.com/Desastre_Show/status/1782483445085520227?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1782483445085520227%7Ctwgr%5E%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;ref_url=">with store page art</a> that makes it look like an AI-generated rip-off of <em>The Last of Us</em>.</p>

 <figure id="attachment_2000633325" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000633325"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000633325">Sony / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p>“<em>Rooted: Survival</em> is a brutal, atmospheric survival experience set in a world consumed by the aftermath of bacteriological warfare. A century after civilization collapsed, nature has reclaimed the earth—but it didn’t come alone,” reads the description. But my favorite part is the disclaimer: “All referenced game titles, brands, characters, and visual elements are the property of their respective owners. Any similarities are intended purely as homage or satire for entertainment purposes. No copyright infringement is intended.”</p> <p>Is this an elaborate troll? Someone making a point about the lack of moderation on the PlayStation Store? After all, this is far from the only <a href="https://kotaku.com/ps5-psn-playstation-store-ai-slop-brainrot-junk-spam-1851786494">AI-looking slop</a> adorning listings seemingly meant to trick casual players just searching for whatever’s popular. Usually, those entries target popular indie games from Steam that lack the resources to police their IP rights on other platforms, not one of the most notoriously litigious companies in gaming and the owner of the platform itself. We’ll see if it actually ends up mattering.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><i>Baby Steps</i> is the latest hilariously difficult game from Bennett Foddy of <i>QWOP </i>and <i>Getting Over It</i>, here working in collaboration with Gabe Cuzzillo and Maxi Boch. And it’s not just in your efforts to put one foot in front of the other and make progress that the game finds ludicrous ways to punish you. Players have discovered that, should you dare to skip the cutscenes throughout your ordeal, you’ll be treated to an unskippable 28-minute cutscene. Congratulations to Foddy &amp; co. for innovating bold new ways for video games to fuck with you.</p> <p>The game loves to do that. Not only does it take the concept of a “walking simulator” to the extreme, making the act of placing one foot in front of the other wonderfully tricky and maddening, but it plays games with its cutscenes, too. Again, literally. Cutscenes taunt you with a mini-game that you must complete if you want to skip ‘em.</p>

 <p>And if you’re really so tempted to give the game the proverbial middle finger and skip all of the cutscenes by passing these mini-games, at the end of the game you’ll be confronted with an unskippable 28-minute cutscene featuring two characters talking about how much of a bummer it is that so much work went into these cutscenes and yet, there you are, just skipping them. Wow. I hope you feel bad about yourself.</p>

 <p>If you’re not up for making your own way, step by hilariously agonizing step, through <i>Baby Steps</i>, skipping the cutscenes all the while, you can watch the whole thing here:</p>   <p>Anyway, the anthropomorphic donkey is enough to sell me on this game. Just what I need, more 2025 gems to fill up my already dense-ass backlog.</p>
