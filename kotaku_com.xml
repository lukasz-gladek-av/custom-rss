He recently told <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cr7nm2g9n9ro&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cr7nm2g9n9ro" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">the <em>BBC</em></a></span> that it can feel impossible to do anything new with  the 2D<em> Zelda</em> format, but they ultimately found a way in the 2024 spin-off about Zelda cloning objects to solve puzzles. </p><p> “And so this game made me realize that there’s still a lot of possibility for these top-down <em>Zelda</em> games as well,” Aonuma said. While nothing is set in stone, it sounds like the team hopes they can continue a dual approach to developing <em>Zelda</em> games in the future. “And so we will also have those dynamic 3D <em>Zelda</em>s as well,” he told the <em>BBC</em>. “But in addition to that, we’re also hoping that we can continue with these 2D top-down <em>Zelda</em>s.”</p><p>Ever since the era of the original Game Boy, the adventure games have been on dual trajectories, with console versions pushing the boundaries of 3D exploration while the portable ones explore new 2D mechanics. The Nintendo DS and 3DS eras especially were full of multiple projects, but as the company’s development pipelines converged with the Switch, which functions as both a handheld and a home console, it’s felt like the 2D side of that equation has languished a bit. </p><p>Prior to <em>Echoes of Wisdom</em>, the multiplayer spin-off <em>Tri Force Heroes</em> was the only new original 2D <em>Zelda </em>in the last decade. <em>Link’s Awakening</em> in 2019, which Grezzo also worked on, was good, but still just a remake of an existing <em>Zelda</em>. <em>Echoes of Wisdom</em>, on the other hand, introduces entirely new mechanics in addition to making the franchise’s namesake actually playable for once. </p><p>Nintendo <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2024/11/the-legend-of-zelda-echoes-of-wisdom-sales-officially-surpasses-two-million&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2024/11/the-legend-of-zelda-echoes-of-wisdom-sales-officially-surpasses-two-million" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">recently confirmed</a></span> that the game has already sold 2.5 million copies in its first month. Hopefully that means we won’t have to wait another 10 years for the next new 2D<em> Zelda</em> game. </p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

This all culminates in a romantic scene between protagonist Rook and their paramour, and they’re…mostly fine. I was initially caught a bit off-guard by how tame most of the love scenes are in <em>The Veilguard</em>, until I remembered that this series has rarely been as spicy as its sci-fi sibling, <em>Mass Effect </em>(and even that depends on which game you’re talking about). In <em>Dragon Age II</em>, for instance, you’d get some heavy petting and making out, but it would cut to black before you saw anything that would have to be blurred out on public television. <em>Inquisition</em> had more nudity, but the actual deed still tended to be behind a black screen. But the emotional core of each scene still rings true, and that’s what counts, right?</p><p>All that being said, not all of&nbsp;<em>The Veilguard</em>’s love scenes are made equal, and we’re going to rank all seven of them right here and now. If you haven’t finished the game yet, avert your eyes, because there are spoilers ahead.</p></div></div><div><p>Much like the dwarven rogue (mage now?) herself, Harding’s love scene is very sweet. She tearfully tells Rook that she never gave up on them after their Fade prison, and they both give each other corny lines about being each other’s rock. See, she has stone-based magic. Do you get it? But then the two embrace, kiss, and her magic rumbles under her as she does a little <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PRwR2J5sCU&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PRwR2J5sCU" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">foot pop</a></span>.</p><p>That’s all well and good, and really fits Harding’s kindhearted demeanor. But where it gets real good is in the pillow talk afterward, when she starts to question if her lover is really the Rook she knew, or maybe a spirit who wandered out of the Fade and became a person. She’s seen this before, and having been present for two world-changing events in the <em>Dragon Age </em>universe, she’s got reason to speculate. Before she started this quest to stop the elven gods, she was a simple scout who signed on to help save the world. Now, she’s seen so much of what she knew change before her. Is it really so surprising that she would question whether her true love was even real?</p></div><div><p>Like most of <em>The Veilguard</em>’s sex scenes, Lucanis’ is pretty tame as far as the physical intimacy, but much more memorable for the emotional intimacy that comes after. Lucanis climbs onto Rook and his crow-like wings appear on his back in a fit of passion. The two kiss briefly, then the cursed black screen shows up again. When the deed is done, Lucanis starts to drift to sleep. The reason for his coffee habit is that he tries to stay awake as long as possible, lest his body be overtaken by the Spite demon that inhabits his body. But it’s not about maintaining control of his body, he just doesn’t want to miss a moment with Rook now that they’re back. It’s a lovely touch to an understated scene. Much has been made of Lucanis’ sleeping habits up to this point, and here they’re used to illustrate that his fears, once focused largely on himself, are now more about Rook. It’s an effective way to communicate how profoundly this relationship has changed him in the context of a love scene.</p></div><div><p>I admire Neve Gallus’ commitment to serving at every moment. As she tearfully expresses her relief at Rook’s return, she is working the camera. Her pushing her lover down onto the couch and closing the door with her ice magic? A slay. Queen shit.</p><p>The debrief with Neve is, much like the Tevinter detective herself, pretty straightforward. She’s always been a straight-to-the-point kinda gal, even when it’s clear she’s dealing with so much uncertainty. She says that even as her city is under siege and she doesn’t know if the two of them will have a future, she’s not going to operate on the assumption that the story of her and Rook ends here. Just like a Shadow Dragon, hoping for a better future at every turn. God, I love her.</p></div><div><p>Bellara is the socially awkward one of the group, and her romance scene doubles down on it. Even when she’s with someone she feels comfortable with, when it comes to discussing the big stuff, she’s still unsure of herself and has to bring a notebook with her, full of things she wants to say to Rook after they disappear into the Fade. She repeatedly has to look back at her notes and still can’t find the words, even when they’re written right in front of her. Bellara has lost so much already that she’s afraid to hope for Rook’s return, or to believe that they truly want her as they say they have. But as Rook reassures her and the two embrace, she drops the book at her feet. Sometimes you don’t need a script to express how you feel when you can show it in other ways.</p></div><div><p>By the time Rook and Taash actually get around to “doing it,” there’s been a lot of outward sexual tension. A few flirts into their conversations will prompt the Qunari warrior to pin Rook against a wall and ask how serious they are about getting on the ride, so when things finally reach that point, it’s more catharsis than anything else. Taash is one of the only two characters who undresses at all during their love scene, and watching a Rook of shorter stature straight-up climb Taash is an incredible sight. As Taash struggles with how to articulate their intentions and finds most labels failing them, the two resign to calling each other “Taarala,” the Qunari word for “mine.” Most of Taash’s story has been about them trying to find ways to express how they feel and resorting to a combination of different dialects, languages, and cultures to express them. It’s fitting, then, that when it comes to putting a label on a relationship, they’d pick one that felt right for them, even if it’s not the most traditional.</p></div><div><p>I adore the Emmrich romance scene because, even if it’s not as steamy as some of the others, it is undeniably his. No other character in <em>The Veilguard</em> could have conceivably been a part of this moment. Rather than going at it in Rook’s quarters, Emmrich takes our hero to the Necropolis to run some magical tests. Rook then takes him by the hand and they do the horizontal tango in one of the open coffins.</p><p>When Rook wakes up in the coffin, Emmrich kindly asks if they’d like some breakfast, completely desensitized to the somewhat morbid scene of someone waking up with a post-sex glow in something usually meant as a resting place for the dead. Then they can go for round two. Death is so central to Emmrich’s being that it only makes sense that it would make its way into the bedroom. If he chooses to become a Lich, there are some slight variations as Rook tells him he doesn’t have to hide his new face from them when the two are alone, which adds a new layer of emotional intimacy not found in other relationships. That’s right; if you wanted to bone a skeleton, <em>The Veilguard </em>is here to let you live out that fantasy. </p></div><div><p>Full disclosure, Davrin was my romance in <em>The Veilguard</em>, and I think the elven Warden’s sex scene set me up to be relatively disappointed by most of the others. It’s still pretty PG-13, but it’s definitely one of the more explicit ones. Davrin comforts Rook after their return from the Fade, and unlike in most other scenes, you actually get to see the two undress each other. They share some cheesy banter as Rook mounts Davrin on the couch, then is picked up and laid on their back in the bed. His scene, along with Taash’s, are undeniably the two that get hot and heavy. Like, I’m watching it again and it makes me wonder just why the actual sex in the sex scenes felt underserved in most other romances.</p><p>But even with all that, the emotional come-down after is one of brutal honesty, as Rook wonders if the two’s previous conversation about their future still applies. Davrin is the kind of guy who hears his significant other ask if he’d still love them if they were a worm and says, “Yes, dear,” instead of telling them that’s a stupid question.</p><p>You get to imagine what your future looks like if and when the elven gods are defeated. Is it hanging up your gear for a life of domestic bliss with your bird cat son? Or will the two of you go out and find new adventures facing the monsters of Thedas? Okay, look. I’d planned on putting some other scene above Davrin’s when I started writing this ranking so as not to play favorites, but BioWare cooked here. This is the best one. Sorry. I’m winning. F’s in the chat for the rest of y’all, but my Rook is bouncing on it in a way that would end the Blight.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

But beyond that, right now, we’re seeing four particular decks getting the most play and the most success.</p><p>It’s fair to say that Mewtwo’s is the deck that’s causing most consternation, given that it really does feel a little too over-powered, although others would argue Charizard’s build is the most dangerous. But all four of these builds are winners, and all capable of taking on each other. So, read on for the strengths, weaknesses, and best ways to play each of these four decks.</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="165622e6b7d56ae70b57b1298c51fe29" data-recommend-id="image://165622e6b7d56ae70b57b1298c51fe29" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Mewtwo ex / Gardevoir." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Mewtwo ex / Gardevoir." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->The Pokémon Company / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="165622e6b7d56ae70b57b1298c51fe29" data-recommend-id="image://165622e6b7d56ae70b57b1298c51fe29" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Mewtwo ex / Gardevoir." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>Every online card game sees a deck develop that has everyone just want to quit. For <em>Pokémon TCG Pocket</em>, it’s Mewtwo/Gardevoir. And I <em>love</em> playing it.</p><p>There are so few drawbacks, too. Occasionally you’ll get plain unlucky, and the game will just refuse to give you a Ralts or a Mewtwo, which leaves you with a pile of mediocre cards that’ll fall to any other solid deck. But that happens far less often than you’d think.</p><p>It’s outrageously easy to win with this, to the degree where you start wondering if The Pokémon Company is going to be forced to issue a nerf. If they did, it would make sense to prevent it from attacking two turns in a row. But please don’t, because it’s too fun right now.</p><h3 id="h18061"><a id=""></a><strong>Advantages</strong></h3><ul data-type="List" data-style="Bullet"><li>All-dominating</li><li>Hard to mess up</li><li>Hard to counter</li></ul><h3 id="h18062"><a id=""></a><strong>Disadvantages</strong></h3><ul data-type="List" data-style="Bullet"><li>Can be tricky to evolve Gardevoir</li><li>People quitting on you</li></ul><h3 id="h18063"><a id=""></a><strong>Cards</strong></h3><p>The essential cards for this deck are two of Ralts, Kirlia, and Gardevoir, and at least one Mewtwo ex. I’ve not been fortunate enough to pull a second of those, so back it up with a standard Mewtwo that lacks the two-energy 50 damage attack but otherwise works the same. Then, you’re going to want two Poké Balls, two Professor’s Research, and at least one X Speed. After that, you can experiment. My setup is:</p><ul data-type="List" data-style="Bullet"><li>Jynx x2</li><li>Ralts x2</li><li>Kirlia x2</li><li>Gardevoir x2</li><li>Clefairy</li><li>Clefable</li><li>Mewtwo ex</li><li>Mewtwo</li><li>Potion x2</li><li>X Speed x2</li><li>Poké Ball x2</li><li>Professor’s Research x2</li></ul><h3 id="h18064"><a id=""></a><strong>How to play the deck</strong></h3><p>The trick here is that Mewtwo ex (and even the regular Mewtwo) has a devastating 150 attack, which the game attempts to temper by having you require four energy to use it and discard two of them every time you do. Except, along comes Gardevoir, evolved from Ralts and Kirlia, with the Ability to add an energy to your Active Pokémon every turn. That means, along with the energy you get per turn anyway, you can replenish back up to four every single turn. It’s unrelenting.</p><p>The two key things are to get Mewtwo in the Active Spot and Gardevoir evolved. So, you want Ralts on deck ASAP, and then put Jynx or Clefairy into play from the start. They can absorb early attacks while you prime Mewtwo with energy and get Ralts into Kirlia, then Kirlia into Gardevoir. When the cards fall right, this can happen in just two turns. Otherwise, hold your nerve, let your starting card take a dive if you need to, and then put Mewtwo in when you’re ready.</p><p>The Professor’s Research and Poké Ball cards should help you get any missing Pokémon out of the deck, and it’s worth having those X Speeds so you can pull out Jynx or Clefairy for free when you’re ready to move in Mewtwo—otherwise you’ll end up an energy behind, spent on the retreat cost. Then, blast, replenish, blast, replenish, and your opponent is likely going to be dependent upon unlikely coin flips to outdo it.</p><p>If anything, the main failing with this deck is that when people see you setting it up, they concede before you even get going. They lack spirit. Although, it’s hard to blame them, given there’s very little that can stand up to it.</p><p>I think, eventually, people are going to start countering with decks featuring Aerodactyl, given every attack has a 50 percent chance of the opponent having to shuffle their Active Pokémon into their deck. That’d be a devastating blow against Mewtwo, so shhhh, don’t tell anyone else.</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="8a6b8fa62fd678837ac99dee96a45b12" data-recommend-id="image://8a6b8fa62fd678837ac99dee96a45b12" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Charizard ex / Moltres ex." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Charizard ex / Moltres ex." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->The Pokémon Company / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="8a6b8fa62fd678837ac99dee96a45b12" data-recommend-id="image://8a6b8fa62fd678837ac99dee96a45b12" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Charizard ex / Moltres ex." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>Depending on your vantage point, there are those who would argue it’s Charizard that may have a slight edge on every other deck out there at the moment. While it takes some time to get online, and once again relies on coin-flip energy accrual, the ex variant of Charizard guarantees a one-hit kill on everything, and can start attacking as early as three energy. It’s also just a lot of fun for any old Pokéheads out there for whom a holographic Charizard was the de facto all-star of the trading card game’s early years.</p><h3 id="h18065"><a id=""></a><strong>Advantages</strong></h3><ul data-type="List" data-style="Bullet"><li>Strongest attack in the game</li><li>Simple strategy</li><li>Edges out every other ex card in an equal race</li></ul><h3 id="h18066"><a id=""></a><strong>Disadvantages</strong></h3><ul data-type="List" data-style="Bullet"><li>Takes a while to come online</li><li>At the mercy of Moltres Inferno Dance coin flips</li></ul><h3 id="h18067"><a id=""></a><strong>Cards</strong></h3><p>There are two options for the Charizard ex deck. One is to focus just on Charizard and Moltres and fill up on items to insulate you in the early game. The other is to swap in Ponyta and Rapidash for Red Cards and Sabrina to give you more flexibility and early game options.</p><ul data-type="List" data-style="Bullet"><li>Charizard ex x2</li><li>Charmeleon x2</li><li>Charmander x2</li><li>Moltres ex x2</li><li>Potion x2</li><li>X Speed x2</li><li>Poké Ball x2</li><li>Professor’s Research x2</li><li>Sabrina x2</li><li>Red Card x2</li></ul><h3 id="h18068"><a id=""></a><strong>How to play the deck</strong></h3><p>The number one goal is to get Moltres ex out as soon as possible, with a Charmander on the bench, and start loading the latter up with fire energy. From there, all you need is to evolve it to Charizard in a timely manner and start unloading Crimson Storm attacks for 200 damage each.</p><p>If you don’t luck out with the coin tosses, or it’s taking longer than desired to get Charizard up and running, your best bet is buying time with item cards and making sure Charizard has at least five energy before bringing him out to fight. That way, he can use back-to-back Crimson Storms. And at 180 HP, it’s very likely he’ll be able to at least get both off before getting killed.</p><p>Red Cards and Sabrinas, meanwhile, should help you disrupt your opponent’s flow to buy you time to bring Charizard online and prevent them  getting a Starmie ex, Mewtoo ex, or Pikachu ex into position and loaded up with energy first. An extra 10 damage from Giovanni will be useless in most cases, which is why that card isn’t in the deck.</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="ad1a1e21b60bc67365b564e63c36e5c3" data-recommend-id="image://ad1a1e21b60bc67365b564e63c36e5c3" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Starmie ex / Articuno ex." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Starmie ex / Articuno ex." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->The Pokémon Company / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="ad1a1e21b60bc67365b564e63c36e5c3" data-recommend-id="image://ad1a1e21b60bc67365b564e63c36e5c3" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Starmie ex / Articuno ex." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>There’s one deck that’s received more prominence than any other, and that’s Lapras and Starmie. Star of the game’s first big event, it’s the deck absolutely everyone’s been battling in order to win those Lapras ex cards to start building their own. <em>Don’t use it</em>. There’s a better variant.</p><p>That’s not least because the Lapras version is also the deck absolutely everyone’s learned how to beat. The real star here is Starmie, teamed up with Articuno ex and the mercurial Misty, for a risky deck that dishes big damage</p><h3 id="h18069"><a id=""></a><strong>Advantages</strong></h3><ul data-type="List" data-style="Bullet"><li>Low-cost, powerful attacks</li><li>Very quick to set up</li><li>Devastating to Fire decks like Charizard</li></ul><h3 id="h18070"><a id=""></a><strong>Disadvantages</strong></h3><ul data-type="List" data-style="Bullet"><li>Misty is unreliable for energy</li><li>Weak to Electric decks</li><li>Needs a fast setup to work</li></ul><h3 id="h18071"><a id=""></a><strong>Cards</strong></h3><p>There’s less room for improvisation here, given that there’s really no better back-up choice than Psyduck and Golduck, and the deck absolutely depends on both Misty and the cards to pull Pokémon from your deck. Articuno ex is your best second-runner to Starmie, too, as alternatives like Blastoise would require a three-step evolution and take over the deck.</p><ul data-type="List" data-style="Bullet"><li>Staryu x2</li><li>Starmie ex x2</li><li>Articuno ex x2</li><li>Psyduck x2</li><li>Golduck x2</li><li>Potion x2</li><li>Red Card x2</li><li>Poké Ball x2</li><li>Professor’s Research x2</li><li>Misty x2</li></ul><h3 id="h18072"><a id=""></a><strong>How to play the deck</strong></h3><p>The key here is speed. This is all about getting Starmie ex in play before your opponent has had a chance to get their deck rolling. The brutal Mewtwo/Gardevoir deck is tough to beat, but a lot easier if you’re already taking chunks out of your opponent while Mewtwo is still tying his shoes.</p><p>The ideal situation is getting Staryu in the Active Spot before the game even starts, then evolving as quickly as possible, which is why you need two of each to improve the odds of this working. If Staryu is AWOL, putting Psyduck in is an excellent delay, as while its one-energy hit only does a paltry 10 damage, it also prevents the other player from using any Supporter cards on their next turn, and that means they can’t use Professor’s Research to dig out cards they need from their deck. It also blocks all the specialist supporters, like Blaine, Koga, Lt. Surge, and Brock from helping get Pokémon ready, and indeed the infuriating Sabrine from making you swap out your active Pokémon.</p><p>Once you’ve got Starmie ex evolved, you’re flying. You can now do 90 damage a turn, for just two energy. That’s not the 200 a Charizard ex can deliver (although it’d be 110 against Charizard thanks to its weakness!), but the idea here is to be dishing out those 90s to Charmander and Charmeleon before the ‘Zard has ever evolved. Also, Starmie ex has no retreat cost, so you can pull it when it’s getting weak, preventing the opponent taking those two points, and you don’t need to waste space in your deck with X Speeds. (Other setups for this deck keep the X Speed cards in, but we’ve subbed them for hand-wrecking Red Cards, because it’s such an excellent dick move to annoy your opponent.)</p><p>Articuno ex is there to sub in, in case Starmie is a no-show or is weakening. It’s a poorer option—doing 80 damage for three energy, with the bonus of a further 10 to opposing benched Pokémon—but it’s a Basic card, requiring no evolution, and its 140 HP will hold off enemies for a while. It’s really for Articuno that you want Misty in your deck, as should the coin-flips fall your way, you could get it loaded with energy to fight on turn 2.</p><p>Hopefully, when the cards fall your way, this means you can demolish your opponent long before they’re ready to fight back.</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="8eab2935ae4815c4a1064ba057adb1c2" data-recommend-id="image://8eab2935ae4815c4a1064ba057adb1c2" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Pikachu ex / Zapdos ex." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Pikachu ex / Zapdos ex." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->The Pokémon Company / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="8eab2935ae4815c4a1064ba057adb1c2" data-recommend-id="image://8eab2935ae4815c4a1064ba057adb1c2" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Pikachu ex / Zapdos ex." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>Pikachu ex is another straightforward deck to play, but unlike Charizard ex it goes a lot faster. While Zapdos ex can’t quickly fill up the energy reserves of your bench, you don’t need it too, since most cards in this deck only require two electric energy to be off to the races. The goal is to move fast and break things with Voltorb and Electrode before later retreating at no cost, thanks to the latter’s built-in speed X perk.</p><p>Pikachu ex and Zapdos ex then provide the heavy hits, with advantages against other legendary birds and water decks. And because of the low retreat costs, you should be able to rotate your bench aggressively and snag kills without losing anyone in return. And unless you’re getting lucky with Zapdos’ Thundering Hurricane coin flips, you’ll need to be retreating since most attacks in this deck aren’t hitting for over 100 damage.</p><h3 id="h18073"><a id=""></a><strong>Advantages</strong></h3><ul data-type="List" data-style="Bullet"><li>Comes online fast</li><li>Very efficient</li><li>Lots of maneuverability</li></ul><h3 id="h18074"><a id=""></a><strong>Disadvantages</strong></h3><ul data-type="List" data-style="Bullet"><li>Lower ceiling on single-turn damage output</li><li>Must utilize electric Pokémon to maximize Pikachu ex’s Circle Circuit effectiveness</li><li>Weak to water decks</li></ul><h3 id="h18075"><a id=""></a><strong>Cards</strong></h3><p>While Pikachu ex and Zapdos ex take time and luck to acquire, even newer players will quickly be swimming in Voltorb and Electrode. There’s also a lot of versatility outside of the two stars, with options for variants that mix in Raichu, Zebstrika, and Magneton. Lt. Surge is a must for Raichu and Magneton builds, since he makes it easy to quickly reroute energy from retreating Pokémon to those on the bench taking their place.</p><ul data-type="List" data-style="Bullet"><li>Pikachu ex x2</li><li>Zapdos ex x2</li><li>Electrode x2</li><li>Voltorb ex x2</li><li>Potion x2</li><li>X Speed x2</li><li>Poké Ball x2</li><li>Professor’s Research x2</li><li>Sabrina x2</li><li>Red Card x2</li><li>Giovanni x2</li></ul><h3 id="h18076"><a id=""></a><strong>How to play the deck</strong></h3><p>The name of the game with Pikachu ex is speed. You want to hit the ground running, filling up your bench with electric Pokémon—though always saving an open spot for Pikachu ex if it hasn’t already been deployed. Voltorb is a great starting Pokémon because its Electrode evolution does a guaranteed 70 damage for just two energy, and it can retreat at no cost anytime, leaving room to bring Pikachu ex or Zapdos ex out and start wreaking havoc.</p><p>A mix of Giovanni and Potion can help you get a pick off early without giving any ground, while Red Card and Sabrina hopefully scramble your opponent before they can get a Mewtoo, Charizard, or other heavy-hitters that will kill your Pikachu ex or Zapdos ex in one hit.</p><p>If your opponent is able to establish that foothold, this deck will struggle to wrest back control of the board. That’s why it’s all about dictating the pace of the match early, and finishing things before one of those decks can come online.</p><p>.</p></div></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
