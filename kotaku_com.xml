The game has peaked at around 3,000 concurrent on Steam so far, which is where <em>Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League</em> was less than a month after launch. “I refuse to believe this game went through actual playtesting,” wrote another Steam user. “It’s not possible.”</p><p><em>MindsEye</em> follows ex-soldier Jacob Diaz, a man with a mysterious implant who’s losing his mind. He heads to the Vegas-inspired near-future city of Redrock to unravel what’s happening to him and engage in all sorts of intrigue, action, and open-world driving. Despite obvious comparisons to <em>Grand Theft Auto</em>, given the large map and third-person view, its more akin to a <em>Mafia</em> game in that if you go off the beaten path you will not actually encounter all that much. It’s a big world but an empty one, propelled by a cutscene-heavy story campaign that takes up to 15 hours. </p><p>Many were hoping <em>MindsEye</em> would end up being an AA shooter that punched above its weight.

Every expansion in <em>Pokémon TCG Pocket </em>has changed how the game plays so much that very few cards from the base Genetic Apex set see use today. Still, some cards have held their ground despite the power creep, and you’ll undoubtedly sow fear into the eyes of your foes by bringing them into battle. Here are five monsters that are well worth bringing into your deck.</p><h2 id="h680829"><a id="1"></a>Rampardos</h2><p><strong>Set</strong>: Space-Time Smackdown: Dialga</p><p><strong>Pros</strong>: Rampardos is so strong that you could be tricked into thinking it’s an ex card. Its damage potential is on par with Giratina, and you only need a <em>single energy </em>for it to attack. Additionally, it packs respectable survivability at 150 HP. 50 damage recoil <em>does </em>admittedly sting, but since this only triggers on a KO, Rampardos can still headbutt way above its weight class against bulky opponents.</p><figure id="" data-id="057011734ce005ecb3c9afe126af97e0" data-recommend-id="image://057011734ce005ecb3c9afe126af97e0" data-format="jpg" data-width="1122" data-height="1548" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A screenshot of the Rampardos card from Pokémon TCG Pocket." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A screenshot of the Rampardos card from Pokémon TCG Pocket." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->The Pokémon Company / Timothy Monbleau / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="057011734ce005ecb3c9afe126af97e0" data-recommend-id="image://057011734ce005ecb3c9afe126af97e0" data-format="jpg" data-width="1122" data-height="1548" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A screenshot of the Rampardos card from Pokémon TCG Pocket." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>This monster was already good when it debuted in the Space-Time Smackdown expansion, and the introduction of <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://pocket.limitlesstcg.com/cards/A3/144&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://pocket.limitlesstcg.com/cards/A3/144" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Rare Candy</a></span> has only made it better. Nearly every Fighting-type deck is built around this monster as of writing, and it’s easy to see why.</p><p><strong>Cons</strong>: Cards that evolve from fossils are always risky, and Rampardos is no exception. You can’t use a Pokéball to get a fossil in your hand, and it’s vulnerable to a quick KO via <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://pocket.limitlesstcg.com/cards/A1/225&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://pocket.limitlesstcg.com/cards/A1/225" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sabrina</a></span> if you have nothing else on your bench.

Given the overwhelming prevalence of Supporter cards in the average <em>Pokémon TCG Pocket </em>deck, boosting that 50 damage to 100 damage is remarkably easy. And since it only needs two colorless energy to attack, it can slot into any deck that needs a secondary attacker. Want to pair the overwhelming power of Rampardos with Sivally? You can, and many players do!</p><figure id="" data-id="4c30a9c5f790c876abe32fe02ad227aa" data-recommend-id="image://4c30a9c5f790c876abe32fe02ad227aa" data-format="jpg" data-width="1122" data-height="1548" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A screenshot of the Silvally card from Pokémon TCG Pocket." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A screenshot of the Silvally card from Pokémon TCG Pocket." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->The Pokémon Company / Timothy Monbleau / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="4c30a9c5f790c876abe32fe02ad227aa" data-recommend-id="image://4c30a9c5f790c876abe32fe02ad227aa" data-format="jpg" data-width="1122" data-height="1548" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A screenshot of the Silvally card from Pokémon TCG Pocket." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>On top of all these perks, Silvally is only a Stage-1 evolution too.

These two monsters are far from invincible together, especially if your opponent gets their strongest attackers on the front lines early on. But just putting Oricorio on the field will force your opponent to change their playstyle, which can net you wins if they don’t have an established gameplan for dealing with the bird.</p><p><strong>Cons</strong>: Magnezone is the rare Stage-2 monster that does <em>not </em>want to use Rare Candy, so it’s slower to get up and running than other meta-dominant evolutions. Spending an extra turn to evolve might not seem like a big deal, but <em>Pokémon TCG Pocket </em>is so fast-paced now that you want to build momentum in your favor as soon as you can. Further, just placing Magneton on the field may compel your opponent to use cards that make you shuffle your deck, potentially tossing Magnezone out of your hand right as you were counting on playing it.</p><hr><h2 id="h680832"><a id="4"></a>Meowscarada</h2><p><strong>Set</strong>: Shining Revelry</p><p><strong>Pros: </strong>One of the best ex-counters in the game so far.

This is fine for picking off basic Pokémon before they can evolve into Stage-2 forms, and two-shotting Pokémon like Oricorio isn’t bad. However, this still leaves room for your opponent to chip away at Meowscarada before finally bringing in an ex Pokémon to blast it away.</p><p>Mewoscarada typically pairs with other grass-type attackers like <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://pocket.limitlesstcg.com/cards/A3/12&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://pocket.limitlesstcg.com/cards/A3/12" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Decidueye ex</a></span> who can cover the cat’s weaknesses and greatly benefit from its strengths.

Of course, what you’re really bringing the ninja frog along for is its <strong>Water Shuriken </strong>ability. This lets Greninja attack <em>any </em>of your opponent’s Pokémon, even as it sits safely on the bench.

Greninja can pick off foes in a pinch in the active slot, but otherwise you’ll want this frog’s big tongue parked on a stacked bench where it’s safe from a surprise Sabrina switch-in.  </p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
