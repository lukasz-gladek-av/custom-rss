While we didn’t get a crossover with the two heroes in the first season of the Disney+ limited series, we did recently get a nearly 14-minute conversation between Robert Downey Jr. and the show’s star, Dominique Thorne, in which the former gushed over how the show’s first episode managed to fit a Marvel movie’s worth of world-building into just 45 minutes.</p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="197583" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="Ironheart's New Trailer Delivers A Couple Cool Surprises" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="136" data-playlist="197583,197589,197586" data-current="197583"><div><p>Ironheart's New Trailer Delivers A Couple Cool Surprises</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197583/197583_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197583/197583_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197583/197583_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/23104.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>If anyone knows what goes into a <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/marvel-cinematic-universe-phase-5-marvel-comics-1851785555&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/marvel-cinematic-universe-phase-5-marvel-comics-1851785555">Marvel film</a></span>, it’s the man who has appeared in 10 MCU flicks. Speaking about the <em>Ironheart</em> series premiere, Downey praised the episode’s ability to introduce a new character in <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/ironheart-riri-williams-breaking-bad-walter-white-1851784602&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/ironheart-riri-williams-breaking-bad-walter-white-1851784602">Riri Williams</a></span> while quickly establishing the impetus of her journey, developing the supporting cast, and complicating the show’s emotional core by giving her a dead friend as her AI sidekick. To the most important actor in the history of the MCU, Thorne ran “the whole gamut of an MCU film in 40 minutes.”</p><p>He’s not wrong. What made <em>Ironheart</em> one of my <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/andor-severance-black-mirror-daredevil-best-tv-shows-1851779606&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/andor-severance-black-mirror-daredevil-best-tv-shows-1851779606">favorite shows of 2025</a></span> is how ambitious the storytelling was from the very start. In the first episode alone, the show explores the world’s obsession with iron suits after Tony Stark’s death, centers the Iron Man legacy on intelligence rather than money by having Riri build a suit out of scrap metal, and uses childhood trauma to justify the creation of her AI assistant. Each of those story beats could’ve been entire episodes on lesser Marvel series.</p><p>Beyond his love of the show’s storytelling, Downey also explained how Tony Stark and Riri Williams are “twin flames.” It all begins with the heart. Tony Stark’s journey starts in <em>Iron Man</em> after one of his weapons explodes and a piece of shrapnel gets dangerously close to his heart. That injury—and Ho Yinsen (Shaun Toub) using an electromagnet to keep the shrapnel from reaching his heart—inspires the creation of the arc reactor, Stark’s most important invention. Riri’s heart is physically intact when her <em>Ironheart</em> journey begins, but Downey sees a philosophical connection between their origin stories.</p><p>“In this iteration, the heart is not only [about] going home, but also this disparity and inequity, and knowing she can only do as much as she can do.”</p><p>When this video was shot, he’d only watched the first three episodes of the show and he hints at a second conversation between the two that will take place after he finishes the series. Let’s all hope we get more intergenerational chats to push the superhero genre forward.</p></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://kotaku.com/robert-downey-jr-ironheart-iron-man-mcu-disney-plus-1851785928]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>If you’re like me, you might have booted up <em>Mario Kart World </em>and immediately started spamming Charge Jumps as soon as you learned how to do them. After all, they <em>seem </em>like a Drift that lets you keep moving straight, and Drifts are awesome! Charge Jumps generate Mini-Turbos just like drifting does too, and <em>Mario Kart World </em>features more wide straight paths than any game in the series has had before. You can even start charging another Charge Jump the second you land! This has to be a new speed-generating technique, right?</p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="196698" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="Princess Peach’s Leading Role And More New Releases" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="121" data-playlist="196698,195719,196572" data-current="196698"><div><p>Princess Peach’s Leading Role And More New Releases</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196698/196698_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196698/196698_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196698/196698_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196698/196698_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/22254.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>Unfortunately, it appears the opposite is true: <strong>Charge Jumps actually <em>slow you down</em>.</strong></p><p>Day-one <em>Kart </em>fans began to notice that Charge Jumps might actually come with a speed loss <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/mariokart/comments/1l4vd1x/does_the_charge_jump_slow_you_down/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/mariokart/comments/1l4vd1x/does_the_charge_jump_slow_you_down/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">shortly after release</a></span>. These findings were then confirmed via a YouTube video by Karting All Day titled “What’s the FASTEST way to go STRAIGHT in Mario Kart World?” Among the experiments shown in the video, a racer using Charge Jumps is shown going face to face against an identical racer who is simply accelerating forward without pressing any other buttons. The Charge Jump player definitively loses.</p><h2 id="h5997"><a id=""></a>The Charge Jump slows you down, no matter which character or vehicle you use</h2><p>The video by Karting All Day is probably enough evidence to show that you shouldn’t spam Charge Jumps in <em>Mario Kart World</em>, but just to be <em>extra </em>sure, I repeated the video’s experiments myself. I switched my test subjects to two Baby Marios using the Cute Scoot just to see if a low Top Speed and high Acceleration build would meaningfully change the results.</p><p>[Narrator’s voice]: it didn’t. </p><p>The Charge-Jump-spamming-Baby-Mario would always lose ground as soon as he initiated a Charge Jump, and the Mini-Turbo afterward just couldn’t make up the difference. The results were the same on water, though it did seem the two racers wound up closer together than they did during the land test. </p><figure id="" data-id="c5615d59b8f11e5a1be99c3f8f720deb" data-recommend-id="image://c5615d59b8f11e5a1be99c3f8f720deb" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Pianta rides on a rail." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Pianta rides on a rail." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Nintendo / Timothy Monbleau / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="c5615d59b8f11e5a1be99c3f8f720deb" data-recommend-id="image://c5615d59b8f11e5a1be99c3f8f720deb" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Pianta rides on a rail." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Frankly, even if there is a kart and driver combination that can get a <em>slight </em>speed boost from Charge Jumps under the right circumstances, I still wouldn’t recommend it. You’d be much better off looking for jumps to do tricks off of and grabbing item boxes than compromising your mobility for a virtually insignificant (at <em>best</em>) speed boost. Maybe a speedrunner will find a use for this tech on long straightaways, but for now, it’s not worth spamming.</p><h2 id="h5998"><a id=""></a>So, what’s the Charge Jump even good for then?</h2><p><strong>Despite everything said above, Charge Jumps are still useful! Just generating one spark while initiating a Charge Jump will give you enough air to latch onto grind rails</strong> (which the game officially calls “<span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/mario-kart-world-rail-wall-charge-jump-ride-switch-2-1851784648&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/mario-kart-world-rail-wall-charge-jump-ride-switch-2-1851784648">Rail Rides</a></span>”), which <em>can </em>increase your speed under the right circumstances. Even if a Rail Ride isn’t a speed boost, you still might prefer pulling one off to break away from a congested crowd of racers throwing an utter mess of items at each other. </p><p><strong>Charge Jumps can also be used to initiate Wall Rides</strong>, which are similarly situational speed boosts. Even if you aren’t an expert player looking to shave seconds off your World Record times, you do need to Wall Ride to get <em>several </em>Question Block Panels in <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/mario-kart-world-switch-2-coins-question-marks-outfits-1851784658&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/mario-kart-world-switch-2-coins-question-marks-outfits-1851784658">Free Roam mode</a></span>. So one way or another, you want to get used to pulling this trick off.</p><p>Grinds and Wall Rides take a lot of practice and planning to be genuinely helpful during races, but they can lead to <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/mario-kart-world-switch-2-clips-stunts-rewind-wall-1851783907&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/mario-kart-world-switch-2-clips-stunts-rewind-wall-1851783907">some of the coolest tricks the <em>Mario Kart </em>series has ever seen</a></span> if you do them right. So long story short, even if you shouldn’t use Charge Jumps everywhere you go, you should absolutely experiment with them to see what shortcuts they might lead to.

Developer Funcom recently nerfed the endgame area’s PVP potential, turning almost half of it into PVE-only territory. That has unintentionally now resulted in the land covered in a bunch of giant boxes. Here’s why. </p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="197525" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="Erenshor Turns The MMO Experience Into A Surprisingly Fun Single-Player Game" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="142" data-playlist="197525,196790,196345" data-current="197525"><div><p>Erenshor Turns The MMO Experience Into A Surprisingly Fun Single-Player Game</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197525/197525_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197525/197525_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197525/197525_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/23056.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p><em>Dune: Awakening</em>, which has continued attracting lots of players on PC despite <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/dune-awakening-survival-mmo-funcom-advanced-access-1851783808&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/dune-awakening-survival-mmo-funcom-advanced-access-1851783808">a minor fall-off from its peak at launch</a></span>, is a survival crafting game. The natural progression system is harvesting stuff to build stuff to harvest more stuff to build bigger stuff. Eventually, that requires players to venture out into the largely PVP-centric Deep Desert in order to access the rarest Tier 6 materials. Early on, that meant getting preyed upon by roving bands of veterans who could easily outgun their weaker opponents (<span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/dune-awakening-ornithopters-reddit-1851784501&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/dune-awakening-ornithopters-reddit-1851784501">or drop entire ships on them</a></span>). </p><p>So Funcom did the sensible thing and made the PVP <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://duneawakening.com/news/dune-awakening-1-1-0-5-patch-notes/#11017&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://duneawakening.com/news/dune-awakening-1-1-0-5-patch-notes/#11017" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">section of the map smaller</a></span> with further plans to iterate on PVP mechanics and make it feel more engaging and fair. The studio also greatly increased the number of T6 resource nodes available in PVE areas.

The Deep Desert also wipes every week, deleting all players structures to keep things fresh and interesting.

Some fans have suggested making resource nodes no-build zones, while others wonder if there is a way to simply have the resources spawn outside of the structure. Others have called for the spawn points to be randomized each wipe, giving non-griefers a fighting chance to get some resources before the dust settles. Then there are those who think resources like  Titanium and Stravidium should just spawn back in Hagga Basin, <em>Dune: Awakening</em>’s newb-friendly starting area. </p><p>In the meantime, PVE and PVP players are facing another stalemate in the Deep Desert and even some griefers are getting bored. “We found and downed another guy, landed by him and he tells us that it was his 4th lost Thopter today, he didn’t know how to pocket or something,” <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/duneawakening/comments/1lv7tve/today_i_did_some_ethical_griefing_to_find_out/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/duneawakening/comments/1lv7tve/today_i_did_some_ethical_griefing_to_find_out/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">wrote</a></span> a PVP raider on the subreddit. “We gave him a ride back, gave him more melange than his small refinery could dream of making in a day’s worth of grinding and our old mk5 assault. After that, we realised that we aren’t built for Funcom’s creative vision of the endgame.” </p><p>.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://kotaku.com/dune-awakening-t6-resource-node-base-patch-notes-1851785897]]></content:encoded>

When I played with them, most were excited that the game was popular once more. Some even said things like, “Wow, EA really hasn’t made anything as good as this in years!” or “This is the best <em>Star Wars</em> game ever!” It’s very funny how a few years and some updates can erase all the negativity that once surrounded this troubled shooter. </p><p>Will all these sales and huge playercounts translate into anything? I’m not sure. I’d love a PS5/Xbox Series X/S port of <em>Battlefront 2, </em>or at the very least an option to run the game at 120FPS on the more powerful machines.
