              <p>LEGO sets is a holiday gifting staple that works for kids and adults but as Christmas approaches, finding products that actually arrive before December 25th becomes increasingly critical. This <em>Hogwarts Castle and Grounds</em> building set <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4207/">currently sells for $140 on Amazon, down from its regular $169 price</a>, and more importantly, it ships with guaranteed delivery before Christmas through Amazon’s fast shipping network.</p>
<p>This 2,660-piece display model recreates the most iconic location from the Harry Potter universe in impressive detail which makes it perfect for adult collectors and Harry Potter fans.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4207/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Full Castle Recreation with Amazing Detail</h2>
<p>The model shows how complicated the architecture of Hogwarts Castle is by including the <strong>Main Tower, Astronomy Tower, Great Hall, several courtyards, bridges, greenhouses, the Boathouse, and even the Black Lake</strong>. Each part fits together to make a complete picture of the castle grounds that matches the size and layout fans know from the books and movies.</p>
<p>The castle’s interior details make famous places come to life, like the <strong>Chamber of Secrets</strong> with its snake-shaped architecture, the Winged Key room from the Philosopher’s Stone challenges, the Potions Classroom where Snape scared students, and the Chessboard Chamber with its checkered floor pattern. These hidden details are worth looking for closely, and they add depth to the model beyond its impressive shape.</p>



<p>The grounds around the castle add to the experience by including important parts of the larger Hogwarts setting. The Durmstrang Ship is ready to take students who are visiting, and the Beauxbatons Carriage is a nice touch that fits with the story of the Triwizard Tournament. The Whomping Willow is standing there with its unique twisted branches, and the crashed Ford Anglia is nearby as a nod to Chamber of Secrets.</p>



<p>One of the best things about the model is how good it looks: When finished, <strong>it is over 8.5 inches tall, 13.5 inches wide, and 10 inches deep</strong> and the castle stands out on a shelf, desk, or display area without taking up too much space or needing a whole bookcase to hold it. The gold-colored Hogwarts architect statue mini-figure that comes with it is the icing on the cake, and the <em>“Hogwarts Castle”</em> nameplate makes it a collectible display piece.</p>
<p>You’re saving here almost $30 on a big LEGO set that has a lot of pieces and detail for the price. In this size range, LEGO sets that are similar to castles or buildings usually cost the same or more, so this deal is a good deal for adults who like LEGO and the promise of delivery before Christmas takes away the stress of ordering gifts so close to the holiday.</p>

            <guid>1385923</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>The year is coming to a close. While you’re crossing off every name on your list of who you need to shop for this holiday season, make sure not to forget someone especially important—you. That’s right, you deserve a big upgrade this time of year. How about saying goodbye to slow, spotty internet with the help of a Wi-Fi 6E mesh network? <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6467/">Right now, you can save as much as 40% on an eero Pro 6E mesh Wi-Fi router.</a> Individually, the router normally goes for $250, but the limited time deal has it marked down to just $160. You’ll save a solid $90.</p>
<p>A mesh Wi-Fi router’s real value lies in its ability to create a mesh network, which requires more than one router. Amazon offers these routers both individually and in bundled sets, including two, three, and four packs. Currently, these bundles are all heavily discounted. The two-pack, originally priced at $400, is now down to $240; the three-pack, originally $550, is now available for $330; and the four-pack, originally $800, has been reduced to $490. The best value right now is the three-pack, as each node costs just $110, making it the most affordable choice for expanding your network.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6467/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Full Home Coverage</h2>
<p>Slow or unreliable internet can be incredibly frustrating, especially when you’re trying to load web pages or stay connected to your devices at home. A Wi-Fi 6E mesh network, like the eero Pro 6E system, can resolve these issues by providing consistent coverage. Each eero node covers up to 2,000 sq. ft. and can support more than 100 Wi-Fi-enabled devices. The system’s patented TrueMesh technology ensures that your network traffic is routed efficiently, reducing dead zones and drop-offs.</p>
<p>With a three-node setup, you’ll be able to cover up to 6,000 sq. ft., connecting over 300 devices simultaneously. If that’s not enough, you can easily add more nodes later on to further expand both your coverage area and device capacity.</p>



<p>With the addition of Wi-Fi 6E, which introduces access to the 6 GHz band. It operates as a third lane, separate from the traditional 2.4 GHz and 5 GHz bands. You’ll experience faster speeds and improved performance across more devices. And setting up your mesh network is straightforward. The eero smartphone app provides step-by-step guidance to get your system up and running in no time.</p>
<p>In addition to excellent wireless coverage, three eero Pro 6E routers all together feature six built-in Ethernet ports, which can support speeds of up to 1 Gbps (1,000 Mbps). This makes them ideal for high-demand activities like streaming 4K video or playing cloud-based games. With the growing number of devices that support cloud gaming, such as Fire TV sticks and Samsung smart TVs, you can enjoy smooth gaming experiences without needing a physical console, thanks to the fast and reliable internet.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/steam-top-selling-2025-friendslop-rpgs-sales-2000654157</link>
            <guid>1385920</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>What were the most popular Steam games of 2025? Players have a sense based on Steam charts, general vibes, and what dominated conversations this year, but analyst Simon Carless recently shared official <em>GameDiscoverCo</em>. estimates for the top-performing games that show <a href="https://kotaku.com/clair-obscur-expedition-33-budget-cost-goty-sandfall-2000652590">just how much RPGs</a> and <a href="https://kotaku.com/peak-roblox-cliff-knock-off-aggro-crab-2000614671">multiplayer games</a> reigned supreme.</p> <p>The latest edition of <a href="https://newsletter.gamediscover.co/p/revealed-the-top-new-pc-and-console-58">his excellent newsletter</a> contains estimates for the top-20&nbsp;<em>new</em> games on Steam this year by both total sales and total revenue. Here’s the list of games with the most copies sold:</p> <blockquote><p>20. Revenge on Gold Diggers<br> 19. Borderlands 4<br> 18. Dispatch<br> 17. Mage Arena<br> 16. The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion Remastered<br> 15. Split Fiction<br> 14. Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2<br> 13. Stellar Blade<br> 12. Megabonk<br> 11. Elden Ring Nightreign<br> 10. Clair Obscur: Expedition 33<br> 9. RV There Yet?<br> 8. Escape From Duckov<br> 7. Hollow Knight: Silksong<br> 6. Arc Raiders<br> 5. Monster Hunter Wilds<br> 4. Schedule I<br> 3. Battlefield 6<br> 2. Peak<br> 1. R.E.P.O.</p></blockquote> <p>What stands out? Well, as Carless notes, the “<a href="https://www.inverse.com/gaming/friendslop-peak-repo-fortnite-trend">friendslop</a>” like <em>Peak</em> and <em>R.E.P.O.</em> were huge, suggesting that many players do indeed just want to play games in which the co-op mechanics encourage goofing around with others. Multiplayer games in general were dominant, taking the six top slots. Fantasy RPGs were also super popular, with <em>Oblivion</em>, <em>Deliverance 2</em>, and <em>Clair Obscur</em> all having strong showings. I also think it’s worth calling out <em>Borderlands 4</em> and <em>Monster Hunter Wilds</em> specifically. Both struggled with PC optimization and word-of-mouth probably did them no favors, but they landed spots here regardless. Even so, it’s surprising to see <em>Borderlands 4</em> <em>below</em> an episodic narrative game like <em>Dispatch</em>.</p>

 <p>This list is arranged by total sales though, and <em>Borderlands 4</em> launched at $70. When you look at the list of top 20 games by revenue instead, <em>Borderlands 4</em> breaks into the top 10 and<em> Dispatch</em> (which is only $30) falls to number 19. That list is still very much skewed back toward 2025’s conventional blockbusters, with <em>Battlefield 6</em> at number 1. Clearly a big part of which games break out big time on Steam comes down to a lower barrier to entry. <em>Schedule I</em> is only $20, <em>R.E.P.O</em> is only $10, and <em>Peak</em> is just $8.</p> <p>Are games that engineer viral moments and encourage you to bully your friends into buying them the key to unlocking success on Steam, or has “friendslop” run its course? At the very least, these games are cheaper and quicker to make than MMOs, MOBAs, and RPGs, so we probably won’t have to put up with a bunch of knock-offs that missed the boat launching in 2028.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/sonos-offloads-ace-anc-headphones-with-spatial-audio-apple-and-bose-suddenly-look-overpriced-2000654149</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Premium noise-cancelling headphones flood the market with excellent options from Apple, Sony, Bose, and now Sonos, which means choosing between them often comes down to price rather than dramatic performance differences.</p>
<p>The good news is that <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5727/">Amazon currently offers the Sonos Ace at a record low of $279, slashed from its typical $399 price tag</a> which makes this the most affordable these headphones have ever been since their launch. If you’re already invested in the Sonos ecosystem or simply appreciate the brand’s reputation for audio quality, this deal removes the premium pricing barrier that kept many potential buyers on the sidelines.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5727/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Dynamic head tracking for spatial audio that really works</h2>
<p>The <strong>Dolby Atmos feature on the Sonos Ace gives you spatial audio that surrounds you</strong> with three-dimensional soundscapes instead of just sending stereo sound to your ears. Dynamic head tracking keeps track of how your head moves and changes the audio positioning so that sounds stay in their virtual places even when you turn or tilt your head: This technology changes how you listen to movies, immersive music mixes, and video game audio by giving you a sense of space and direction that regular stereo headphones can’t.</p>
<p>Bluetooth lossless audio streaming keeps the full quality of your music files without the artifacts that come with<strong> regular Bluetooth codecs and for truly lossless digital audio, you can also connect via USB-C</strong>. This is great for high-resolution music files or studio-quality recordings when you want the best sound quality possible. This dual connectivity method lets you choose between ease of use and the best sound quality, depending on where you’re listening and what you’re listening to.</p>



<p><strong>Active noise cancellation</strong> does a great job of blocking out outside sounds, even better than most of the products from Sony and Bose. The world-class ANC system easily blocks out noise from airplane cabins, coffee shops, streets, and offices, so you can fully focus on your audio content or just enjoy the quiet when you need a break from all the noise. When you need to hear announcements, have conversations, or stay aware of your surroundings for safety, transparency mode lets environmental sounds in which keeps you from feeling too isolated.</p>
<p>With Active Noise Cancellation turned on,<strong> the battery lasts for 30 hours</strong> which is enough for a whole week of commuting to work or weeks of casual listening between charges. The rapid charging feature lets you listen for three hours after just three minutes of being plugged in. This means that even a short charging session during a coffee break will give you enough power for the rest of the day.</p>



<p>You can easily switch between devices so you can go from watching a movie on your tablet to taking a call on your phone without having to go into Bluetooth settings and disconnect and reconnect. The headphones remember multiple paired devices and switch between them automatically based on which device needs sound at the time. When you use multiple devices throughout the day, this feature gets rid of the annoyance of having to pair them all the time, which is a problem with many wireless headphones.</p>
<p>At $279 instead of $399, you’re saving $120 on headphones that compete with flagship models from established audio brands that often cost even more at full retail price. The Sonos Ace delivers premium features like lossless audio, Dolby Atmos with head tracking, world-class ANC, and 30-hour battery life at a price that now undercuts many competitors that offer similar or inferior specifications.</p>

              <p data-start="0" data-end="638">While many gamers have long wished for an official handheld Xbox console, it seems unlikely that Microsoft will make that dream a reality anytime soon. However, Asus is offering something very close with the release of the updated ROG Ally, now sporting official Xbox branding.

<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6320/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2 data-start="973" data-end="1001">Play Xbox Games Anywhere</h2>

Boot straight into your games with the new Xbox App UI and even stream Xbox titles directly from your console or via Microsoft’s cloud gaming service. The device also gives you access to the Xbox Game Bar with a dedicated Xbox button on the left side. While it’s optimized for Xbox games, the ROG Xbox Ally also supports platforms like Steam, the Epic Games Store, and other digital storefronts, so you’re not confined to Xbox-exclusive content.</p>
<p data-start="1633" data-end="1890">In terms of specifications, <strong>the ROG Xbox Ally features 16GB of dual-channel RAM and a 512GB PCIe Gen4 M.2 SSD</strong>. If you find yourself running out of storage space for your growing game library, the device’s storage is upgradeable, allowing for easy expansion.</p>


<p data-start="1892" data-end="2459">The 7-inch screen boasts 1080p HD resolution and a 120Hz refresh rate, placing it on par with other premium handheld devices like the Steam Deck. At just under 1.5 pounds, the ROG Xbox Ally is lightweight, maintaining a comparable weight to its main competitor from Valve. Its chassis design is inspired by the Xbox wireless controller, offering contoured grips that provide improved comfort during extended gaming sessions. Whether you’re playing on the go or connecting it to a TV using the dual USB-C ports, the ROG Xbox Ally gives you flexibility for a variety of gaming setups.</p>
<p data-start="2461" data-end="2685">To ensure long-lasting gameplay, the handheld comes equipped with a 60Wh battery that supports rapid charging. With just 30 minutes of charging, you can reach up to 50% battery life, so you can get back to your game quickly.</p>
<p data-start="2687" data-end="2967">The Asus ROG Xbox Ally is positioning itself as a top contender in the portable gaming market and with the current holiday discount, now’s a very appealing time to jump in.</p>
<p data-start="2969" data-end="3324" data-is-last-node="" data-is-only-node="">For those who want even more power, the Asus ROG Xbox Ally X is available as an upgraded model. This version features a more powerful processor, additional RAM, and a 1TB SSD—doubling the base model’s storage capacity. It also includes an 80Wh battery for extended playtime, making it an excellent choice for gamers seeking a high-end handheld experience.</p>
