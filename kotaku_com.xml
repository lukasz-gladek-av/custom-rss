The patch added a ton of content, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/call-of-duty-tmnt-turtles-80-90-bundle-battle-pass-s2-1851765490&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/call-of-duty-tmnt-turtles-80-90-bundle-battle-pass-s2-1851765490">including some really expensive <em>TMNT </em>skins</a></span>, new weapons, and—most importantly for <em>THPS </em>fans out there—Grind, a skateboard park map. And it’s in here that we got out latest piece of evidence that a new <em>Tony Hawk </em>video game is soon to be announced. </p><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://x.com/charlieINTEL/status/1892621320598208577&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://x.com/charlieINTEL/status/1892621320598208577" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">As spotted by <em>Charlie Intel </em>on Twitter</a></span>, in the new Grind map, you can find a skate shop area and in there you can spot a small poster that clearly includes the OG <em>Tony Hawk’s Pro Skater </em>logo as well as a date: March 4, 2025. In response to the teaser, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://x.com/tonyhawk/status/1892622967579832757&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://x.com/tonyhawk/status/1892622967579832757" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Tony Hawk himself simply replied with eyeball emojis</a></span>, seemingly confirming that, yeah, this is for sure a teaser for a new game. (Xbox on Twitter also replied with the same emoji.) </p><p>Why did this appear in a <em>Call of Duty </em>game? Well, remember that before Activision was a <em>Call of Duty </em>machine, it published all the past <em>Tony Hawk</em> games. So this seems to be a bit of corporate synergy. How fun!</p><p>This is just the latest (and most concrete) evidence of a new <em>Tony Hawk’s Pro Skater</em> game. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/tony-hawk-pro-skater-new-game-remaster-leak-confirmed-1851765242&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/tony-hawk-pro-skater-new-game-remaster-leak-confirmed-1851765242">Earlier this week</a></span> a skateboarder who appeared in the last game, 2020's <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://eneba-games.sjv.io/09da5O&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://eneba-games.sjv.io/09da5O" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>Tony Hawk’s Pro Skater 1+2</em></a></span><em>,</em> claimed he’s appearing in a new <em>Tony Hawk</em> “remaster.” <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/tony-hawk-pro-skater-activision-new-game-confirmed-thps-1851646946&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/tony-hawk-pro-skater-activision-new-game-confirmed-thps-1851646946">And in 2024</a></span>, Tony Hawk himself claimed the series had a future and that he was working with Activision again. </p><p>And on top of all that, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://insider-gaming.com/next-thps-remasters-will-shadow-drop-at-xbox-summer-showcase-its-claimed/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://insider-gaming.com/next-thps-remasters-will-shadow-drop-at-xbox-summer-showcase-its-claimed/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">on Wednesday, it was reported</a></span> that Microsoft (which owns Activision) was planning to announce and release a new <em>Tony Hawk </em>game in June as part of a yet-to-be-announced summer event. The game is reportedly <em>Tony Hawk’s Pro Skater 3+4</em>, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/tony-hawks-pro-skater-3-4-call-duty-activision-1851459426?_gl=1*emnk8d*_ga*NzE0NzM5NTc5LjE3Mjk4Njg5MzU.*_ga_V4QNJTT5L0*MTczOTg5NTkzMy4yMDAuMS4xNzM5ODk4NDQyLjYwLjAuMA..&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/tony-hawks-pro-skater-3-4-call-duty-activision-1851459426?_gl=1*emnk8d*_ga*NzE0NzM5NTc5LjE3Mjk4Njg5MzU.*_ga_V4QNJTT5L0*MTczOTg5NTkzMy4yMDAuMS4xNzM5ODk4NDQyLjYwLjAuMA..">a project that was pitched years ago</a></span> but which Activision passed on. The game is claimed to be called “Project Chicago” internally and is set to shadow drop during the Xbox event this Summer. </p><p>We’ll have to wait and see if that report is accurate and just what that <em>Call of Duty</em> map is teasing, but it does seem like something is coming pretty soon and as a massive <em>Tony Hawk’s Pro Skater</em> fan, I’m excited. </p><p> .<br></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

It just might mean you need to have two versions of the game installed depending on who you are playing with, which sounds kind of silly even if I understand why.</p><p>Regardless of that hang-up, its nice to see Rockstar Games finally getting around to updating the PC port of<em> GTA V</em>, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/gta-6-release-october-borderlands-4-take-two-rockstar-1851764006&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/gta-6-release-october-borderlands-4-take-two-rockstar-1851764006">even if we are likely less than a year away from the release of <em>GTA 6</em></a></span>. That game won’t be out on PC at launch anyway, so I guess PC players can enjoy a better version of <em>GTA V</em> while they wait for the inevitable port. Let’s hope it doesn’t take three years. </p><p> .<br></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
