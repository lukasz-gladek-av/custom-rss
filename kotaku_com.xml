            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>The season for patient players and procrastinators has arrived. Anyone who held off on buying new games this year can now get them for much cheaper. Not every new release is steeply discounted <a href="https://kotaku.com/tag/black-friday-2025">for Black Friday 2025</a>, but there are definitely some exceptional deals this time around.</p> <p>In years past, when there were more AAA releases and physical games were more prevalent, the Black Friday deals were easier to pinpoint. Now, everything is on sale almost all the time, so it’s harder to figure out what’s worth paying attention to and actually grabbing at that new discounted price.</p>

 <p>Below is a quick list of 12 of the biggest games that came out this year and how cheap they are on various storefronts and platforms:</p> <ul> <li><strong><em>Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2</em></strong> (PS5/Xbox Series X/S) – <strong>$30</strong> (57 percent off) at Amazon/GameStop</li> <li><strong><em>Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater</em></strong> (PS5/Xbox Series X/S) – <strong>$50</strong> (29 percent off) at Best Buy</li> <li><strong><em>Doom: The Dark Ages</em></strong> (PS5/Xbox Series X) – <strong>$35</strong> (50 percent off) at Microsoft / $40 (43 percent off) at Target</li> <li><strong><em>Assassin’s Creed Shadows</em></strong> (PS5/Xbox Series X/S) – <strong>$35</strong> (50 percent off) at Best Buy</li> <li><strong><em>The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion Remastered</em></strong> (PS5/Xbox Series X/S) – <strong>$33.50</strong> (33 percent off) at Microsoft / $40 (20 percent off) at Best Buy</li> <li><strong><em>Death Stranding 2</em></strong> (PS5) – <strong>$50</strong> (29 percent off) at Target</li> <li><strong><em>Elden Ring Nightreign</em></strong> (PlayStation/Xbox) – <strong>$25</strong> (38 percent off) at Amazon</li> <li><strong><em>Monster Hunter Wilds</em></strong> – <strong>$30</strong> (57 percent off) at Amazon and Best Buy</li> <li><strong><em>Split Fiction </em></strong>– <strong>$40</strong> (20 percent off) at Amazon and Target</li> <li><strong><em>Silent Hill f</em></strong> (PS5/Xbox Series X/S) – <strong>$50</strong> (29 percent off) at Best Buy</li> <li><strong><em>Avowed</em></strong> (Xbox Series X/S) – <strong>$47</strong> (33 percent off) at Microsoft</li> <li><strong><em>Borderlands 4</em></strong> (PS5/Xbox Series X/S) – <strong>$48</strong> (31 percent off) Amazon</li> </ul> <p>Anything that came out this year and is already half off or more is a decent pick-up. That includes <em>Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2</em> and <em>Monster Hunter Wilds</em>, both of which are exceptionally crafted, sprawling games that you can snag for just $30. <em>Assassin’s Creed Shadows</em> and <em>Doom: The Dark ages</em> are also both half-price, though only the digital version for Xbox when it comes to the latter.</p> <p>At the other end you have games that came out more recently and aren’t quite ready to hit that bargain bin status. Of these, <em>Borderlands 4</em> is the most decent find at less than $50 despite only being a couple of months old. <em>Death Stranding 2 </em>at just $20 off is borderline, but not too shabby for <a href="https://kotaku.com/game-awards-2025-goty-nominees-categories-clair-obscur-2000644825">a GOTY contender heading into awards season</a>. The biggest steal on this list is probably <a href="https://kotaku.com/elden-ring-nightreign-dlc-forsaken-hollows-artorias-dark-souls-2000643101"><em>Elden Ring Nightreign</em></a><em>. </em>At $25 it’s not the biggest discount but it was already just $40 to begin with and it’s hands-down the best multiplayer action-RPG around right now.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/upgrade-your-gaming-monitor-to-this-27-inch-asus-tuf-down-to-179-ahead-of-black-friday-2000645598</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/asus-tuf-27%E2%80%9D-gaming-monitor-just-hit-its-lowest-price-ever-one-of-the-fastest-selling-black-friday-deals.1359691/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Black Friday and Cyber Monday are approaching fast, but you don’t actually have to wait until then to start saving. Some products are already seeing some early Black Friday Discounts over a week ahead of schedule. If you’re thinking about upgrading your old monitor or putting together a brand-new desk setup, the Asus TUF gaming monitor is definitely worth a look. Whether you play games regularly or just want a solid everyday display, this 27-inch QHD screen checks all the important boxes—and right now it comes with a surprisingly large discount. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5755/">For a short time, Amazon is taking 28% off the price. It normally sells for $249, but the current deal drops it to just $179, giving you a full $70 in savings.</a></p>
<p data-start="609" data-end="1082">The Asus TUF gaming monitor offers a comfortable 27-inch size that feels spacious without overwhelming your desk. It delivers a 2560 x 1440 QHD resolution, which is pretty much the sweet spot for a display of this size. HDR support helps produce rich, punchy colors with standout whites and dark, deep shadows. On top of that, the 180Hz refresh rate is impressively fast, and compatibility with both G-SYNC and FreeSync keeps your visuals smooth by reducing screen tearing. It utilized Asus Extreme Low Motion Blur Sync (ELMB Sync) which works to eliminate ghosting, increasing clarity for games with high frame rates.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5755/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<p>It’s 1ms response time will keep the games you play feeling fast and snappy, allowing you to react nearly instantaneously. Since making the jump from being a console gamer to PC gamer, I’ve come to realize just how important this is. I didn’t know how bad I had it on my old Vizio TV until I played through <em>Silksong</em> on my gaming laptop, and then tried booting it up on my TV. Felt unplayable. I breezed through many of the platforming sections on my laptop but struggled with the simplest jumps when moving to my TV.</p>
<p data-start="1433" data-end="1683">The monitor plays nicely with a wide variety of devices—your gaming PC, laptop, Nintendo Switch, Steam Deck, or nearly anything else you’d want to plug in. It features two HDMI 2.0 ports and a DisplayPort connection, giving you plenty of flexibility.</p>


<h2 data-start="1433" data-end="1683">Game on for Longer</h2>
<p data-start="1685" data-end="1864" data-is-last-node="" data-is-only-node="">The stand supports both height and tilt adjustments, letting you fine-tune the viewing angle so you can stay comfortable, even during long workdays or late-night gaming marathons.</p>
<p data-start="1685" data-end="1864" data-is-last-node="" data-is-only-node=""><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5755/">Even if you’re not into gaming, this monitor is genuinely impressive for the price—especially with the 28% markdown.</a> You’ll even receive three free months of Adobe Creative Cloud with your purchase.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/gopro-hero-13-just-dropped-by-90-joining-amazons-early-black-friday-sales-2000644665</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/gopro-hero13-black-falls-to-the-loweset-price-that-only-black-friday-could-make-happen.1359688/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Planning on going on an adventure and filming it? Your smartphone might not be the best gear for the job. You need a solid action camera that helps you film like a pro, even when things get complicated (hiking, swimming, cycling, etc).</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5635/">The GoPro Hero 13 is made for just that, and Amazon is offering a chance to grab it for less right now.</a> This $400 camera is now going for $310, which is also the lowest price we have seen it drop to in 30 days. It’s an early Black Friday deal, which means it’s likely going to expire soon. Now is the time to improve your filming experience without shelling out big bucks.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5635/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Sharp, Clear, and Stable Footage</h2>
<p>This tiny but mighty camera shoots in 5.3K at 60fps, which offers 91% more resolution than 4K and over six times the detail of standard 1080p. That means sharper, brighter footage for all your adventures, whether you’re filming in the day or at night. You will also be able to shoot slow-motion videos. In fact, the Hero 13 is GoPro’s slowest slow-mo camera yet, capable of capturing video slowed down by up to 13x. Use it for high-action shots where every frame counts!</p>
<p>For stunning photos, it offers 27MP still image capture, so you don’t need a separate camera for high-quality shots. It even turns into a webcam or live streaming camera when needed, which can be quite useful for remote workers.</p>



<p>There’s HB-Series lens compatibility as well, which lets you set up your camera for a wide range of specialty shots. Even better, the camera automatically detects which lens or filter you’ve attached and fine-tunes the settings for it. This way, you can spend more time doing what you love instead of worrying about complicated camera settings.</p>
<p>HyperSmooth 6.0 stabilization keeps the footage impressively stable, even when you’re on the move. Bumpy rides or a bit of chaotic running won’t leave you with shaky footage that’s tough to watch or headache-inducing. All things considered, the GoPro Hero 13 can be a great option for anyone who needs a reliable action camera to record all their indoor and outdoor adventures.</p>
<p>It offers high-quality footage, stunning stills, impressive stabilization, and a lot more. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5635/">The current deal drops the price to just $310, making the upgrade quite affordable. Grab it while the offer is still live.</a></p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/this-motion-controlled-gaming-console-the-nex-playground-is-under-200-at-amazon-2000634139</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>The 2000s had the EyeToy. The 2010s had the Kinect. And now the 2020s have the Nex Playground. This play system will get you and the whole family up from the couch, moving and grooving while you play a variety of awesome games. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5753/">Thanks to Amazon’s Black Friday, you can grab the Nex Playground on sale. It’s currently 20% off.</a> That brings the price down from $249 to just $199, saving you an even $50. That ends up being less than half the price of the new Nintendo Switch 2 console.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5753/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Get Up and Moving to Play</h2>
<p>The Nex Playground is a plug-and-play gaming console built around motion controls. No controller necessary because your body is the controller. Just connect it to your TV over HDMI with the front camera pointed toward a space you’ve cleared enough in front of it for you to move around in. Depending on the game, up to four players can be up and out of their seats to play along together.</p>
<p>Out of the box, you’ll have access to five fun games. This includes <em>Fruit Ninja</em>, <em>Go Keeper</em>, <em>Party Fowl</em>, <em>Whac-a-Mole</em>, and <em>Starri</em>. This may be enough to keep you entertained, but you can dive into a huge library of even more games with the Nex Playground Play Pass. Yu’ll gain access to new games each month, some of which feature famous and beloved characters from Barbie, Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, How to Train Your Dragon, Peppa Pig, Care Bears, Elmo, Miraculous Ladybug, Gabby’s Dollhouse, Kung Fu Panda and more. The full catalog includes over 30 games.</p>



<p>The Play Pass can be purchased separately from you Nex Playground. The three-month pass can be acquired for $49 while a full-year pass is set at $89. That works out to just a little over $7 per month. That cheaper than most streaming services go for nowadays. One Play Pass can be used on up to two Nex Playgrounds in the same household. Great for if you have one in the living room and then one in either a finished basement or kid’s bedroom.</p>
<p>The Nex Playground is safe for kids and families as all content is made to be appropriate for all ages. No mature content, no in-app purchases, but best of all the system has no ads. It’s nice to be able to boot up a smart device in the year 2025 without being bombarded with advertising.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/roborock-q10-s5-drops-53-off-amazon-wants-every-unit-gone-from-black-friday-day-one-2000645764</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/roborock-q10-s5-drops-53-off-amazon-wants-every-unit-gone-from-black-friday-day-one.1359613/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>The Roborock Q10 S5+ became <strong>Roborock’s best-selling model within hours of Black Friday starting</strong>&nbsp;and that makes perfect sense when you see the pricing. This <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4512/">robot vacuum and mop combo just dropped to a record low of $259 on Amazon, down from its usual $549 (53% off)</a>&nbsp;while most other Roborock models sit between $600 and $1,000 even with Black Friday discounts.</p>
<p>Roborock built its reputation as a premium brand that competes directly with high-end options from iRobot and Ecovacs and their performance typically commands premium pricing. Robot vacuums solve the eternal problem of maintaining clean floors without dedicating hours to manual vacuuming and mopping each week. The <strong>Q10 S5+ combines 10,000Pa suction, 70-day self-emptying capacity, sonic mopping</strong>, and intelligent obstacle avoidance.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4512/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>70 Days of Truly Hands-Free Floor Cleaning</h2>
<p>The<strong> self-emptying station holds a 2.7-liter dust bag that stores debris for as long as 70 days</strong> before needing replacement. This capacity eliminates the weekly ritual of emptying dustbins that plagues basic robot vacuums and standard self-emptying models with smaller bags. Pet owners, in particular, benefit from the extended capacity since pet hair builds up fast and fills smaller dust containers in days. The station automatically empties the robot’s dustbin after each cleaning session, so you never touch dust or allergens during normal operation.</p>



<p>The <strong>10,000Pa HyperForce suction is serious cleaning power</strong> that pulls embedded pet hair from carpets, lifts crumbs from hardwood grooves, and extracts debris from tile grout lines. This is much stronger than many upright vacuums provide and means this robot can deeply clean rather than just lightly maintain surfaces. Power is automatically adjusted based on floor type and debris detection and rampus up on carpets and dialing it back on hard floors to balance cleaning performance against battery life. A dual anti-tangle system utilizes a JawScrapers comb on the main brush, combined with specialized side brush design to prevent hair wrapping that stops cheaper robots dead in their tracks mid-clean.</p>



<p>The <em>VibraRise</em> 2.0 mopping system scrubs floors with<strong> sonic vibration at 3,000 oscillations per minute</strong>&nbsp;which generates actual cleaning action rather than just dragging a damp cloth across surfaces. This type of sonic scrubbing picks up dried spills, sticky residue, and ground-in dirt that static mopping systems leave behind. When transitioning onto carpets,<strong> it lifts the mop pad up to 8 mm</strong> and saves wet mopping pads from soaking rugs or carpet edges.</p>
<p><em>ReactiveTech</em> obstacle avoidance uses structured light technology that detects objects in its path and navigates with precision around them. The system <strong>identifies shoes, cables, pet toys, and furniture legs without bumping into them</strong> or getting stuck. This obstacle detection works in low-light conditions where camera-based systems struggle, maintaining reliable navigation during nighttime cleaning sessions.</p>
<p>PreciSense LiDAR navigation <strong>scans rooms 360 degrees to create detailed maps</strong> that enable efficient cleaning patterns. It also supports multi-level mapping, remembering layouts for different floors in multi-story homes. The robot will plan an optimal cleaning route that can minimize the area of repeated coverage and reduce cleaning time. <strong>You can set no-go zones, invisible walls, and schedules for specific rooms</strong> with the Roborock app, giving you granular control over where and when the robot cleans.</p>
<p>At $259, the Roborock Q10 S5+ is less than half price while delivering features and performance that usually require spending upwards of $600. The fact that this became Roborock’s Black Friday bestseller in a matter of hours proves that buyers recognize exceptional value when premium performance falls to mid-tier pricing.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Good morning! Welcome to the coolest show in town, <em>Kotaku’s</em> Morning Checkpoint. This is our daily roundup of video game news and other interesting stuff you might care about. Squeeze in, find a seat, and get ready to be blown away by this morning’s showcase, which includes bad news for fans of <em>The Finals</em> on PS4, more layoffs, Sakurai wanting to live a chill life, and more.</p> <h2>Some games that sold a single physical copy in October</h2> <p><a href="https://bsky.app/profile/matpiscatella.bsky.social/post/3m632god4cc25">According to data from Circana’s Matt Piscatella</a>, some odd, old games sold exactly one new physical copy in the United States during October. If you were the person out there who bought a physical copy of <em>Spore</em> in October, email me a photo of the receipt. I want to talk to you about your life. I hope things turn around for you. And if you are the person who bought <em>Incredibles 2: Rise of the Underminer</em> on GBA last month, you are a wild individual, and I respect it. Here’s the full list:</p>

 <ul> <li>360- <em>Burnout Paradise</em></li> <li>3DS-<em> Carnival Games: Wild West 3D</em></li> <li>GBA-<em> Incredibles 2: Rise of the Underminer</em></li> <li>NDS- <em>Imagine Fashion Stylist</em></li> <li>PC- <em>Spore</em></li> <li>PS2-<em> Backyard Baseball</em></li> <li>PS3- <em>Hasbro Family Game Night 3</em></li> <li>PS4- <em>Cooking Mama Cookstar</em></li> <li>XBX- <em>Ultra Bust A Move</em></li> </ul> <h2>Avalanche Liverpool closes, 31 devs laid off</h2> <p>In September, Avalanche Liverpool, the studio behind the <a href="https://kotaku.com/just-cause-makers-xbox-exclusive-contraband-canceled-amid-recent-cuts-2000616371">canceled Xbox game <em>Contraband</em></a>, announced it would be shutting down. And now that has happened. On November 19, <a href="https://avalanchestudios.com/stories/updateliverpool">the studio announced via its official website</a> that it had completely closed its doors and 31 developers had been laid off as a result.</p>

 <p>“The exceptional talent, passion, and commitment from everyone leaving have impacted every project. We are truly grateful for the dedication and invaluable contributions to Avalanche Studios&nbsp;Group. Our focus remains on supporting the Avalanchers through the transition and to carry on making great games for our player communities.”</p>

 <h2>Leave <em>Smash Bros.</em> creator Masahiro Sakurai alone</h2> <p>In a new interview with <a href="https://www.gamespark.jp/article/2025/11/18/159625.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-analytics-id="inline-link" data-url="https://www.gamespark.jp/article/2025/11/18/159625.html" data-hl-processed="none" data-mrf-recirculation="inline-link" data-hawk-tracked="hawklinks" data-mrf-link="https://www.gamespark.jp/article/2025/11/18/159625.html"><u>Game*Spark,</u></a> <em>Smash Bros.</em> and Kirby creator Masahiro Sakurai talked about how he doesn’t consider his life all that interesting and wishes people would just focus on the games and not who made them. So he was surprised that people wanted to turn his story into a manga.</p>

 <p>“I think I’ve always wanted to live an unassuming life,” Sakurai told the outlet, <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/super-smash-bros-and-kirby-creator-masahiro-sakurai-says-its-best-to-just-play-games-instead-of-looking-at-who-made-them-so-please-dont-perceive-him/">as translated by <em>Gamesradar.</em></a> “Even with [being contacted about creating the manga], I’m sure my response was something like ‘really?'”</p>

 <p>“I try my best to communicate my work to others, but I refrain from trying to promote myself. I think I’ve always wanted to live an unassuming life. I think it’s best if people just play games, instead of looking at who made them.”</p>

 <h2><em>The Finals</em> on PS4 will be shut down next year</h2> <p>Before Embark Studios released the massively popular <em>Arc Raiders</em> last month, the company published the destructive shooter <em>The Finals</em> across consoles and PC. It wasn’t as big of a hit, but it’s still kicking and getting updates. But not for much longer on PlayStation 4, <a href="https://x.com/reachthefinals/status/1990810282529046592?t=swsOGicwN1vsbqWO-_CZjg&amp;s=19">as confirmed by the studio earlier this week</a>.</p> <p>“When Season 10 begins (18th of March, 2026), we’ll be retiring <em>The Finals</em> on PlayStation 4 and focusing our support on current generation hardware,” posted Embark Studios. “From that point on, you’ll need to play there to keep enjoying the game.

Well, turns out that Switch port experts Panic Button were contracted by Nintendo to handle those upgrades.</p> <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">Panic Button was honored to be selected by Nintendo to help update marquee games from the Nintendo Switch™ library.  Nintendo asked us to help demonstrate new capabilities of the Nintendo Switch 2 system, while remaining faithful to the original games. <a href="https://t.co/5P96V9DFUq">pic.twitter.com/5P96V9DFUq</a></p> <p>— Panic Button (Official) (@PanicButtonGame) <a href="https://twitter.com/PanicButtonGame/status/1991264499676930507?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 19, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <p>I find this very interesting, as it seems like something Nintendo could have done internally. But instead, they trusted the folks at Panic to handle the upgrades. I bet Panic is feeling very good about that right now, and it will likely help the studio get even more work porting games to the new Switch 2.</p> <h2>ICYMI:</h2> <ul> <li><a href="https://kotaku.com/deadpool-vr-is-a-game-for-deadpool-fans-and-nobody-else-2000645514"><em>Deadpool VR</em> is perfect…for fans of Deadpool</a></li> <li><a href="https://kotaku.com/beast-land-mrbeast-theme-park-saudi-arabia-2000645495">MrBeast’s new “theme park” looks…uh…not great</a></li> <li><a href="https://kotaku.com/kirby-air-riders-reviews-nintendo-switch-2-2000645412">Critics seem to mostly like <em>Kirby Air Riders</em></a></li> </ul> <h2>Watch This:</h2>

              <p data-start="158" data-end="922">For PlayStation 5 owners who regularly find themselves bumping up against the console’s limited storage, keep reading. In the lead-up to Black Friday, Crucial has cut the price of one of its PS5-compatible SSDs, making it easier and more affordable to expand your game library.<a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5752/"> The 2TB Crucial P510 Gen5 NVMe SSD normally priced around $210 has been discounted by 29%, bringing the cost down to $150.</a> That’s a meaningful $60 reduction on a high-performance SSD equipped with its own heatsink for seamless compatibility right out of the box.</p>

<h2 data-start="158" data-end="922">PS5 &amp; PC Compatible</h2>
<p data-start="924" data-end="1686">One of the most common frustrations among early PS5 adopters is the reality of the console’s internal storage limitations. Even though Sony technically lists the system as having an 825GB SSD, the usable space is significantly smaller. After accounting for system files and required software, players are left with roughly 667GB for game installs—a number that feels increasingly cramped as modern titles frequently climb past 100GB each. For anyone with a growing collection, or for those who enjoy bouncing between several big releases at once, that space disappears almost immediately. Installing Crucial’s 2TB expansion effectively triples the amount of room you have to work with, reducing the need to delete old favorites just to make space for new ones.</p>
<p data-start="1688" data-end="2423">Beyond the raw storage boost, the drive is built to meet the PS5’s demanding performance standards. With read and write speeds up of to 11,000 MB/s, the Crucial P510 far exceeds what’s needed to keep pace with Sony’s ultra-fast architecture. The included heatsink, which is required for PS5 internal installation, helps maintain stable temperatures and prevent thermal throttling during extended gaming sessions.</p>


<p data-start="2425" data-end="3119">If you’re planning to install the Crucial P510 SSD into a PC gaming desktop, you’ll be able to make the most of its insanely fast read and write speeds. Just make sure your motherboard supports Gen5 NVMe SSDs. A Gen4 slot will still work with it, just won’t be able to reach the maximum speeds supported by the P510. With optimal conditions, you’ll be able to experience lightning fast load times in your games as well as when working with high-intensive applications such as when video or photo editing. Plus with a full 2TB, you’ll have plenty of room for not just your games, but any important pictures or vids you want to hang onto.</p>
<p data-start="3121" data-end="3308" data-is-last-node="" data-is-only-node="">With its generous performance, significant storage increase, and a timely discount, <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5752/">Seagate’s 2TB Game Drive stands out as one of the most practical PS5 upgrades you can grab this season.</a></p>
