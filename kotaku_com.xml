Titled <em>Like a Dragon: Yakuza</em>, the gritty crime drama follows the series’ longtime protagonist Kazuma Kiryu across two timelines: one as a teenage orphan in 1995, and the other as a hardened yakuza after ten years in jail in 2005. The adaptation is borrowing quite liberally from the beloved series, remixing numerous elements of the first game and its prequel, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/yakuza-0-kiwami-like-a-dragon-amazon-show-1851662354&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/yakuza-0-kiwami-like-a-dragon-amazon-show-1851662354"><em>Yakuza 0</em></a></span>, but controversially, it’s also charting its own path, and the move isn’t quite to everyone’s liking.</p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="196578" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="Total Recall: Why Yakuza Is So Much More Than A Japanese GTA" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="387" data-playlist="196578,194088,195755" data-current="196578"><div><p>Total Recall: Why Yakuza Is So Much More Than A Japanese GTA</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196578/196578_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196578/196578_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196578/196578_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196578/196578_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/22135.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>In one big change from the source material, Amazon’s adaptation appears to be mostly a straightforward and gritty drama. The <em>Like a Dragon </em>games<em> </em>are well known for their soapy melodrama, convoluted plots, humongous casts, and cinematic direction, but they also have a well-established penchant for irreverence. The streets of Kamurocho, where the games mostly take place, are filled with weirdos, like Mr. Libido, who gyrates and thrusts in a manic and sexual frenzy in casual conversation. There’s a yakuza family in the games composed of grown men in diapers who clearly have some oedipal complex. The next game in the series casts one of its best characters, Goro Majima, as a amnesiac pirate, and Kiryu could (and maybe <em>should</em>) leave behind the criminal underworld for a career in the arts, because that man fucks up a karaoke night like no one else.<br></p><p>And yet, <em>Like a Dragon: Yakuza</em> features no diaper-wearing yakuza, nor are there any heart-wrenching renditions of “Baka Mitai,” and that is sure to disappoint a lot of people. This new show seems to cast aside many of these flourishes and embellishments, which the untrained eye might consider the fat of the <em>Like a Dragon </em>games. However, you’re far more likely to find fans who call these distractions and detours the very soul of the franchise, and I’m inclined to agree.<br></p><p>The cast and crew behind <em>Like a Dragon: Yakuza </em><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/like-a-dragon-yakuza-amazon-kiryu-actor-interview-1851592856&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/like-a-dragon-yakuza-amazon-kiryu-actor-interview-1851592856">aren’t without reverence for the source material</a></span> though. Interviews with the actors have provided insight into the production, revealing that developing Kiryu’s combat prowess in a logical way was a huge factor in the lead actor’s preparation. Ryōma Takeuchi, who plays Kiryu in the show, has gone on the record saying that Kiryu’s fighting style differs between the different eras covered in the series and is meant to be consistent with his growth and outlook on life, and his performance seems to be one of the more universally agreed upon highlights of the adaptation. There has also seemingly been an emphasis on Kamurocho itself, and capturing the way that the red-light district (based on the real-world Kabukicho) evolves over time similarly to how it does in the games, which span the decades between the late 80s and the present day. One spinoff even takes place in the mid-1800s, but that’s a conversation for another day.<br></p><p>Outside of the strength of its primary cast, though, <em>Like a Dragon: Yakuza </em>seems like a bit of a murky adaptation. Some reviews accuse it of oversimplifying storylines in order to fit them into a too-short six-episode season. With the action of two huge games being blended into just a handful of hours, it appears that some beloved characters have been minimized. The action choreography doesn’t seem to always leap off the screen, and the show appears to provide very little time and space for the audience to wrap their heads around the complicated structure of Japanese organized crime, which involves a lot of “families,” patriarchs, captains, and more that I’m <em>still </em>learning.<br></p><p>All in all, critics are divided, with some feeling that it’s another outstanding game adaptation in a year that’s already given us <em>Fallout</em> and that its concessions to realism still allow for enough of the surreal spark of the games to shine through, while others find it to be a creative misfire, lacking everything that makes the games so memorable. Here’s what some critics are saying about Amazon’s <em>Like a Dragon: Yakuza.</em><br></p><h2 id="h25523"><a id=""></a><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.inverse.com/entertainment/like-a-dragon-yakuza-review-prime-video&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.inverse.com/entertainment/like-a-dragon-yakuza-review-prime-video" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Inverse</a></span></h2><p>The performances by Kiryu (Ryoma Takeuchi), Nishiki (Kento Kaku), and Yumi (Yumi Kawai) are a strong-as-steel foundation for this show to build on, with each giving deeply emotional performances that have real complexity and layers — especially considering we’re essentially seeing two versions of these characters with two time periods. Takeuchi’s Kiryu especially is a tremendous highlight, a daydreaming boy turned into a stoic warrior who nonetheless has a heart of gold that’s never been chipped away. But past that, the rest of the cast also gives stellar performances that make this world feel grounded, from the far too-tired-for-this-stuff Detective Date (Subaru Shibutani) to the deliciously cold and uncaring Dojima (Masaya Kato), head of the Tojo’s Dojima Family.</p><p><em>Like a Dragon</em>’s other biggest strength is that it’s unapologetically authentic. The show is unafraid to use Japanese terms and yakuza jargon, and the set design and costuming in particular are a fascinating glimpse at 1995 and 2005 Japan. The floral shirts and <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.inverse.com/gaming/yakuza-7-punch-perm-like-dragon-ichiban-kasuga&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.inverse.com/gaming/yakuza-7-punch-perm-like-dragon-ichiban-kasuga" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Punch Perm</a></span> haircuts make <em>Like a Dragon</em> feel like a period piece just as much as a drama, exploring the life and inner workings of the yakuza and the seedy city of Kamurocho. It’s also beautifully shot, making fantastic use of space and angle to heighten the character’s emotions.<br></p><p>But at the same time, this show is taking inspiration from the video games, blending in a sense of surrealism and ridiculousness. There’s just a little edge of unreality to <em>Like a Dragon</em> that gives it extra flavor — from the<em> Fight Club</em>-esque underground combat arena to a secret mass surveillance room run by a police-officer-turned-yakuza. It’s that mix of the familiar and the unknown that makes Kamurocho such a compelling setting; it’s grounded and realistic but with a hint of the unknown.<br></p><h2 id="h25524"><a id=""></a><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.pastemagazine.com/games/amazon-prime-video/like-a-dragon-yakuza-review&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.pastemagazine.com/games/amazon-prime-video/like-a-dragon-yakuza-review" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Paste Magazine</a></span></h2><p>On some level, I’ll admit it: I am biased and went into this TV series with preconceived notions due to my extensive time with these wonderful, dumbass videogames. I was bummed out that the wacky sense of humor was entirely absent from this telling, even if that strangeness would have been challenging to pull off outside of a game where there are more natural ways to create barriers between different modes of storytelling.</p><p>But even accounting for this, Prime Video’s <em>Like a Dragon: Yakuza</em> falls short of its own aims. There are some inspired flashes here and there, and you can see the scaffolding that could have formed a moving, decade-spanning tale of tragedy and revenge. But because the series is so eager to jump from scene to scene, it becomes difficult to care about any individual member of this large cast, robbing these turns of dramatic heft. It all ends up feeling like the show borrows a bunch of surface-level aspects from the games, like names and plot points, but fails to convey the deeper reasons why these characters and their storylines worked, all while it also comes up short of taking things in a new direction. Bad videogame adaptations aren’t exactly unique, but I was hoping for more from the Dragon of Dojima.</p><h2 id="h25525"><a id=""></a><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.ign.com/articles/like-a-dragon-yakuza-review-prime-video&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/like-a-dragon-yakuza-review-prime-video" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">IGN</a></span></h2><p>The original game’s plot is reduced down to a rote tale of theft and revenge – I’ll save spoiling the specifics, but it’s both an unsatisfying setup <em>and</em> conclusion. And in shifting up the events of <em>Yakuza 0</em> to 1995 from 1988, there’s now no commentary on the absurdity of bubble-era Tokyo real-estate economics. It’s actually strange how much money is now flowing around at a time, when in real-world Japan, it categorically wasn’t.</p><p>That’s not to say the world of <em>Yakuza</em> isn’t rendered well in other ways. The detailed set of Kamurochō is delightful. The show is most enjoyable when you take in all the additional details of its worldbuilding – I especially enjoy the cinema showing posters of period-accurate film listings (even acknowledging the huge splash <em>Forrest Gump</em> made in Japan after it was released there in 1995). The final scenes here throw a ridiculous amount of the show’s budget on extras, and it makes the place feel genuinely alive and breathing<br></p><p>[...]</p><p>Without the <em>Like A Dragon</em> name attached, this series would get very little attention. There’s so little that’s very <em>Yakuza</em> in tone, and it’s so limited in inspiration from the games that there’s hardly much you’ll recognize from them. There’s great character work from some of the cast – particularly Kento Kaku as Nishikiyama – but sadly nothing very interesting for them to do.</p><h2 id="h25526"><a id=""></a><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.rollingstone.com/culture/rs-gaming/like-a-dragon-yakuza-sega-amazon-prime-video-1235141494/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.rollingstone.com/culture/rs-gaming/like-a-dragon-yakuza-sega-amazon-prime-video-1235141494/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Rolling Stone</a></span></h2><p>Video game adaptations shouldn’t be constrained with coloring inside the lines so fans can get their reference fix. They should, as <em>Like a Dragon: Yakuza</em> does, feel free to explore different avenues of a game’s mythos, even if that means leaving the series’ wackier elements on the cutting room floor and fully commit to telling a mob story.</p><p>Despite its shortcomings, <em>Like a Dragon: Yakuza</em> not only puts a bold foot forward, making yet another worthwhile <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.rollingstone.com/t/video-game-adaptation/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.rollingstone.com/t/video-game-adaptation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">video game adaptation</a></span> in the wake of <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.rollingstone.com/tv-movies/tv-movie-features/fallout-tv-behind-the-scenes-1234999546/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.rollingstone.com/tv-movies/tv-movie-features/fallout-tv-behind-the-scenes-1234999546/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Amazon’s <em>Fallout</em> series</a></span>, but it also retains the game’s gripping drama and shades of its humor while teeing up what could be an enthralling second season.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Unfortunately, the patch has also messed up how the game looks on PlayStation 5, with players reporting screen tearing issues that break the immersion of its normally gorgeous-looking open worlds. </p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="196013" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="The Top 10 Most-Played Games On Steam Deck: October 2023 Edition" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="316" data-playlist="196013,195301,196345" data-current="196013"><div><p>The Top 10 Most-Played Games On Steam Deck: October 2023 Edition</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196013/196013_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196013/196013_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196013/196013_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196013/196013_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/21533.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p><em>Star Wars Outlaws</em> <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.ubisoft.com/en-us/game/star-wars/outlaws/news-updates/2Vn4XE0lBNrsqFhfkqjrs&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.ubisoft.com/en-us/game/star-wars/outlaws/news-updates/2Vn4XE0lBNrsqFhfkqjrs" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">title update 1.3.0</a></span> went live earlier today as promised and marks an important milestone on the sci-fi blockbuster’s <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/star-wars-outlaws-stealth-bugs-ubisoft-1851637931&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/star-wars-outlaws-stealth-bugs-ubisoft-1851637931">road toward becoming a timeless classic</a></span>, or at least the big money-maker Ubisoft was originally hoping it would be. Highlights in the patch notes include more forgiving stealth conditions in “False Flag” and other missions, fewer collisions while riding speeders, more auto-saves while playing, and scaled “wanted” difficulty based on player progression. A bunch of bugs were also addressed, while overall stability and framerate drops are also supposed to be better.</p><p>Unfortunately, the thing many players on PS5 instantly noticed after booting the game up post-update wasn’t any of these improvements but a noticeable visual downgrade with screen tearing, i.e. ripples across your TV while navigating the world and even menus. The problems are particularly bad in performance mode, which is how most people play their PS5 games. </p><p>“I loaded the game up about half an hour ago and noticed the screen tearing immediately, tried fiddling with the settings for a bit but favor quality (40fps) seems the most stable with very little screen tearing compared to the other graphic settings,” <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/StarWarsOutlaws/comments/1gb65at/screen_tearing_on_ps5/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/StarWarsOutlaws/comments/1gb65at/screen_tearing_on_ps5/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">wrote one player</a></span> on the subreddit. “I just hope this gets fixed soon as the visuals are the only thing that game really has going for it and having to deal with screen tearing is just getting in the way of enjoying the game overall.”</p><p><em>Star Wars Outlaws</em> has one more major update planned for November alongside its arrival on Steam on November 21. That patch is supposed to go even more deeply into fine-tuning combat and stealthy systems, with a Lando-based story pack and free new contract mission types also getting added that month. That’s just in time to make it an extra appealing Black Friday discount pickup for anyone who hasn’t already given the Han Solo simulator a try, at least as long as no more visual bugs get introduced along the way. </p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

The first will take place a week into the new season, which begins on December 10. Rather than a direct return to the 2-2-2 role spread of the original <em>Overwatch</em>, this test will require the team to have at least one hero of each role, but no more than three per team composition. For example, in a six-person team, you could have one tank, one DPS, and one support, and as long as those are accounted for, the other three players can freely pick whatever hero they want so long as there are no more than three per role. This way you’ll definitely have at least one person on healing and another person to tank, so a group can’t just queue up with six damage heroes.</p><p>The second test will take place midway through the season, but will “incorporate some new principles” from the sequel like incorporating hero reworks and deprioritizing crowd control abilities. With any luck, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/overwatch-2-sombra-season-13-patch-notes-ramattra-1851673081&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/overwatch-2-sombra-season-13-patch-notes-ramattra-1851673081">the Sombra revision from the current season</a></span> will have been reverted by then, but I’m not holding my breath.</p><p>In the meantime, Blizzard is also planning on a test for a new variation of its current 5v5 format that limits a team of five to two heroes per role. This means you can finally have two tanks again, but they will have the nerfs associated with the open queue format, so they won’t be quite as powerful as they are in the current, standard role-locked play. This will also include a midseason game mode codenamed “Kingmaker” that will reward any player who is the lone person in one role with a “bonus,” but they didn’t get any more specific than that.</p><p>Blizzard says it’s going to look at the reaction to these tests and determine what’s next, but the studio says there’s a possibility that both 5v5 and 6v6 could exist in the game simultaneously, which might be the best of both worlds, though it does sound like a lot to manage for a team that has seen such drastic cuts in the past year.</p><p>This is probably exactly what some folks who miss the days of the original <em>Overwatch </em>were hoping for, but I still find it hard to get too excited about <em>Overwatch 2</em> when <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/overwatch-2-anniversary-pve-story-events-skins-shop-1851665897&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/overwatch-2-anniversary-pve-story-events-skins-shop-1851665897">it’s given me so little in the past two years</a></span>. Maybe the return of folks coming back to the game to relive the glory days will be enough to rejuvenate my love for it. We’ll see when Season 14 starts in December.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
