Developer Funcom recently nerfed the endgame area’s PVP potential, turning almost half of it into PVE-only territory. That has unintentionally now resulted in the land covered in a bunch of giant boxes. Here’s why. </p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="197525" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="Erenshor Turns The MMO Experience Into A Surprisingly Fun Single-Player Game" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="142" data-playlist="197525,196790,196345" data-current="197525"><div><p>Erenshor Turns The MMO Experience Into A Surprisingly Fun Single-Player Game</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197525/197525_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197525/197525_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197525/197525_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/23056.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p><em>Dune: Awakening</em>, which has continued attracting lots of players on PC despite <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/dune-awakening-survival-mmo-funcom-advanced-access-1851783808&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/dune-awakening-survival-mmo-funcom-advanced-access-1851783808">a minor fall-off from its peak at launch</a></span>, is a survival crafting game. The natural progression system is harvesting stuff to build stuff to harvest more stuff to build bigger stuff. Eventually, that requires players to venture out into the largely PVP-centric Deep Desert in order to access the rarest Tier 6 materials. Early on, that meant getting preyed upon by roving bands of veterans who could easily outgun their weaker opponents (<span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/dune-awakening-ornithopters-reddit-1851784501&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/dune-awakening-ornithopters-reddit-1851784501">or drop entire ships on them</a></span>). </p><p>So Funcom did the sensible thing and made the PVP <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://duneawakening.com/news/dune-awakening-1-1-0-5-patch-notes/#11017&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://duneawakening.com/news/dune-awakening-1-1-0-5-patch-notes/#11017" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">section of the map smaller</a></span> with further plans to iterate on PVP mechanics and make it feel more engaging and fair. The studio also greatly increased the number of T6 resource nodes available in PVE areas. That patch went live <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/duneawakening/comments/1ltph12/11150_patch_notes/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/duneawakening/comments/1ltph12/11150_patch_notes/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">earlier this week</a></span>. The Deep Desert also wipes every week, deleting all players structures to keep things fresh and interesting. So some players were a bit surprised to find that shortly after the wipe this week, there were already resource nodes boarded up by other players, preventing them from being accessed. </p><p>“DD PVE T6 mats experience, a base on each nodes,” <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/duneawakening/comments/1lvikq8/dd_pve_t6_mats_experience_a_base_on_each_nodes_gj/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/duneawakening/comments/1lvikq8/dd_pve_t6_mats_experience_a_base_on_each_nodes_gj/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">wrote one player</a></span> on the <em>Dune: Awakening</em> subreddit today, alongside a picture what looks like a bunch of giant raised flower beds. “Well, looks similar to my Server,” wrote another in response. “There goes another week without T6 mats or progression unless I want to get slaughtered by the Russian zerg that basically owns my server’s DD...” Another angry player in a separate thread shared a similar image and story. “First day of the wipe, found around 15 bases built over titanium nodes in PvE area,” the <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/duneawakening/comments/1lus5uf/first_day_of_the_wipe_found_around_15_bases_built/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/duneawakening/comments/1lus5uf/first_day_of_the_wipe_found_around_15_bases_built/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">wrote</a></span>. “Third week of people being rats.”</p><p><em>Dune: Awakening</em> <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/duneawakening/comments/1lvimen/conversation_with_a_node_blocker/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/duneawakening/comments/1lvimen/conversation_with_a_node_blocker/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">fans speculate</a></span> that this latest form of griefing is aimed at getting desperate players to venture out into the PVP zones and force them to engage with hostile gangs who are otherwise bored of the underlying progression and base-building mechanics. “It’s not even productive for the person doing it,” one player lamented. “You are not going to get regular enough use out of that ore for it to be worth farming, and no one gets the ores at all if a significant number of people do that.”<br></p><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/duneawakening/comments/1lvk1yd/building_on_nodes_brainstorm/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/duneawakening/comments/1lvk1yd/building_on_nodes_brainstorm/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">What are the solutions</a></span>? Some fans have suggested making resource nodes no-build zones, while others wonder if there is a way to simply have the resources spawn outside of the structure. Others have called for the spawn points to be randomized each wipe, giving non-griefers a fighting chance to get some resources before the dust settles. Then there are those who think resources like  Titanium and Stravidium should just spawn back in Hagga Basin, <em>Dune: Awakening</em>’s newb-friendly starting area. </p><p>In the meantime, PVE and PVP players are facing another stalemate in the Deep Desert and even some griefers are getting bored. “We found and downed another guy, landed by him and he tells us that it was his 4th lost Thopter today, he didn’t know how to pocket or something,” <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/duneawakening/comments/1lv7tve/today_i_did_some_ethical_griefing_to_find_out/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/duneawakening/comments/1lv7tve/today_i_did_some_ethical_griefing_to_find_out/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">wrote</a></span> a PVP raider on the subreddit. “We gave him a ride back, gave him more melange than his small refinery could dream of making in a day’s worth of grinding and our old mk5 assault. After that, we realised that we aren’t built for Funcom’s creative vision of the endgame.” </p><p>.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://kotaku.com/dune-awakening-t6-resource-node-base-patch-notes-1851785897]]></content:encoded>

When I played with them, most were excited that the game was popular once more. Some even said things like, “Wow, EA really hasn’t made anything as good as this in years!” or “This is the best <em>Star Wars</em> game ever!” It’s very funny how a few years and some updates can erase all the negativity that once surrounded this troubled shooter. </p><p>Will all these sales and huge playercounts translate into anything? I’m not sure. I’d love a PS5/Xbox Series X/S port of <em>Battlefront 2, </em>or at the very least an option to run the game at 120FPS on the more powerful machines.

Students in vibrant school uniforms gleefully ask for her autograph, even after Wednesday stipulates it’ll be in someone else’s blood.
