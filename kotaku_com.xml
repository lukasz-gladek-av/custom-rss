              <p>When the original <i>Tom Clancy’s Splinter Cell</i> arrived in 2002, it threatened to dethrone <i>Metal Gear Solid</i>’s tight grip on the stealth genre. And for some purists, it likely succeeded, given its groundbreaking technical displays of light and shadow that were more than just pretty to look at. The game also pushed you to move with more caution, with enemies that, in some instances, were far more perceptive than what <i>Metal Gear Solid 2</i> offered at the time. <i>MGS3</i> would arrive shortly after to up its stealth game, perhaps having learned a thing or two from <i>Splinter Cell</i>, but the original <i>SC</i> and its two direct sequels remain incredible challenges for those of us who like to lurk around in the shadows. And if you’ve been craving a return to Sam Fisher’s first outing, then let me tell you about this incredible mod that makes it hard to go back to the original.</p> <p><i>Enhanced SC</i> is a project from modder Joshhhuaaa that you can <a href="https://github.com/Joshhhuaaa/EnhancedSC">grab on GitHub</a> right now for both Windows and Steam Deck. It introduces a suite of improvements, which include a mission statistics tracker that lets you know just how stealthy your current run is, proper widescreen support, fixes to movement speed, better controller support, maps based on original Xbox versions, the Nuclear Power Plant level from the PS2 version, and <a href="https://github.com/Joshhhuaaa/EnhancedSC/blob/main/PatchNotes.md">so much more</a>.</p> <figure id="attachment_2000616402" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000616402"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000616402">© Ubisoft / Joshhhuaaa / Claire Jackson / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p>While many mods of this kind sometimes make for an experience that feels quite different from the original game, <i>Enhanced SC</i> feels remarkably faithful to what it was like to play <i>Splinter Cell</i> on PS2 or Xbox back in the day. There are some notable tweaks to the gameplay, such as the inclusion of whistling (which would show up in later <i>SC</i> games), and distinct commands for opening a door fully or partially to peek into the next room. These feel like very natural inclusions to the original game–in fact, until I read through the patch notes, I didn’t realize they <em>weren’t</em> in the first <i>SC</i>.</p>

 <p>Steam Deck support, however, is where this mod really shines. It runs surprisingly well for such an old game on a Linux machine. There’s also a dedicated “EnhancedSC Layout” controller scheme you can download from the community layouts that allows for precision aiming by way of the right touchpad, and a quicksave and load feature mapped to the left one (this makes quickly resetting to your last save for save-scummy playthroughs a breeze).</p> <figure id="attachment_2000616403" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000616403"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000616403">© Ubisoft / Joshhhuaaa / Claire Jackson / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p>If it’s been a while since you’ve jumped into Sam’s sneaking suit, do yourself a favor and check out this mod. Who knows when (or if) we’re getting <a href="https://kotaku.com/ubisoft-7-canceled-games-splinter-cell-assasin-s-creed-1849976552">that damn remake anyway</a>.</p>

              <p>Sony’s massively popular third-person online sci-fi shooter <a href="https://kotaku.com/helldivers-2-xbox-series-x-s-release-date-ps5-exclusive-1851785573"><em>Helldivers 2</em> is coming to Xbox later this month</a>. Many fans had assumed that developers Arrowhead had been the ones behind the decision, likely pushing PlayStation to let them port the game to the company’s rival console. But it turns out it was actually Sony’s idea, and that’s just more evidence that the <a href="https://kotaku.com/console-wars-are-over-ps5-xbox-forza-switch-2-sony-1851752956">console wars are over.</a></p> <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/helldivers-2-kotaku-review-pc-ps5-is-it-good-ps-plus-1851"><em>Helldivers 2</em> launched in early 2024</a> to <a href="https://kotaku.com/helldivers-2-sony-steam-pc-ps5-players-1851268838">rave reviews and huge player counts.</a> And since then, the game has continued to receive frequent updates, growing larger in scale as it adds more enemies and its massive galactic story of war continues to evolve. But for the last year, the only way to play <em>Helldivers 2</em> was on PS5 or PC. This left Xbox players out of the loop. That changes on August 26, when Helldivers lands on Xbox Series X/S with full crossplay support. And according to Arrowhead’s CEO Shams Jorjani, the decision to port <em>Helldivers 2</em> came entirely from PlayStation.</p> <p>On August 6, as reported by <em>Windows Central,</em> when a player praised Arrowhead for bringing the <em>Helldivers</em> sequel to Xbox, Jorjani stepped in and gave Sony all the credit. “It was all PlayStation. Send them your thanks,” posted Jorjani in the game’s official Discord server. “We were all in support, of course.” The Arrowhead CEO later added, “I think it’s one of the coolest things [Sony’s] done. They’re killing it.”</p> <p>While it might at first seem odd that PlayStation would bring one of its most popular video games in years to a rival platform, the reality is that the console wars have mostly fizzled out. Thanks to crossplay, cross save, Xbox ditching the whole affair after losing last gen, and Nintendo doing their own thing, there’s just not much of a war anymore. <a href="https://kotaku.com/xbox-podcast-exclusivity-business-update-ps5-hi-fi-rush-1851261518?_gl=1*q9wu73*_ga*MTg4NjY0MzM1NS4xNzM5NDU1MDcz*_ga_V4QNJTT5L0*czE3NTM3MDQ1NzEkbzEyOSRnMSR0MTc1MzcwOTY4NCRqNjAkbDAkaDA.">Xbox has found great success bringing its hit games like <em>Forza</em> to PlayStation 5</a>, and Sony is following in their footsteps now by bringing games like <em>Marathon</em> and <em>Helldivers 2</em> to Xbox, as well as continuing to port games like <em>Spider-Man</em> to PC. At this point, it just makes more sense to put your games on more platforms. This is especially true for big, expensive live-service games that rely on lots of players actively engaging with the game daily to make money. So I’d expect to see even more Xbox and PlayStation games hopping across platforms in the future. I mean, <a href="https://kotaku.com/gears-of-war-1-reloaded-remaster-ps5-xbox-pc-summer-1851779167"><em>Gears of War</em></a> is coming to PlayStation this year.&nbsp; <a href="https://kotaku.com/ps5-xbox-exclusivity-helldivers-spiderman-switch-2-1851787122">The walls have fallen. The console wars are over. And only Nintendo seems to care about keeping stuff exclusive</a>.</p>
