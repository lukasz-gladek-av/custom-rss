Here are 13 key pieces of information from the event.</p><hr><ul data-type="List" data-style="Bullet"><li>Pitchford claims <em>Borderlands 4 </em>is going to have a more “grounded tone” that harkens back to the original game.</li><li>Two of the new Vault Hunters in the game were given names and we learned more about them. Vex is a powerful Siren with a ghost-tiger that she can pet and use in combat. Rafa is a former Tediore soldier who uses advanced tech during fights. </li><li><em>Borderlands 4 </em>is set on Kairos, a new planet that was previously controlled and hidden by a mysterious alien being known as the Timekeeper. Some years before the game started, however, a rogue moon crashed into the planet and caused a ton of chaos. (OG character Lilith might have been involved in that...) </li><li>The looter shooter will support crossplay at launch. It will also let you play two-player split screen c0-op. While playing with others you’ll be able to set your own difficulty and all loot will be instanced, so no gun stealing between friends. </li><li>Kairos will feature four massive zones that players can explore freely with  no loading screens. In the mission we saw during the demo, the new hunters were infiltrating a secret blacksite research facility alongside <em>Borderlands 3</em> character Armata. </li><li>You can now glide across large gaps and use your zipline on certain points in exploration or during combat. Gearbox confirmed that sliding, double jumping and dashing are back, too. </li><li>Players will have access to a “Digirunner,” a vehicle which looks a lot like a Sparrow from <em>Destiny</em>. These are single-seat hovercraft that you can spawn into at any point while out in the world. </li><li>While exploring Kairos you’ll discover silos. These are locations that aren’t tied to side quests, but function more like the kinds of activities you might seen in a big open-world game like <em>Assassin’s Creed. </em></li><li>Most of the weapon manufactures from past games, like Tediore and Jakobs, are back. But this time around guns can spawn with “Licensed Parts.” So a Jakobs rifle might have a different brand of scope or barrel, which might change how it fires or the kind of damage it does. This will make the already wildly unique loot you find in <em>Borderlands</em> games even more varied. </li><li>Speaking of loot, Gearbox has reworked how often rare loot drops and promises that Legendaries will be rarer and more powerful than in <em>Borderlands 3</em>. You’ll also be able to unlock enhancements that can make certain weapon brands more powerful. </li><li><em>Borderlands 4 </em>will feature repayable missions and boss fights, which should make it easier than ever to grind for specific loot.</li></ul><p>So yeah, we learned a lot of about <em>Borderlands 4</em>! And I’m excited to see more of the game between now and its (earlier than planned) launch of September 12. <em>Borderlands 4</em> is set to arrive on PS5, Xbox Series X/S, PC, and Switch 2.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

The pricing applies to both 2600 and 7800 cartridges.”</p><p>Atari’s ‘80s-inpsired gaming lineup includes the wood-paneled 2600+ and streamlined 7800+, along with the Atari 400 Mini and VCS digital gaming set top boxes. The prices for those appear to remain unchanged, but the replica cartridges will seemingly go from $30 to $33, a small but noticeable bump due to recently levied import taxes. If you want the entire collection of old-school cartridges, you’ll easily end up spending over $60 in tariff-adjusted price increases alone. </p><p>Atari might be a household name, but it’s only the latest retro gaming device maker to alter course due to the trade war.

As the global trade situation continues to evolve, we will be as transparent as possible about any further adjustments we may need to make.”</p><p>.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
