Unlike some of those earlier additions, however, fans are actually excited about the sword-wielding assassin’s reveal, at least for now.</p><p>“Now that is an awesome Deathstroke design!” <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideSquadGaming/comments/1h86tt7/deathstroke_on_december_10th/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideSquadGaming/comments/1h86tt7/deathstroke_on_december_10th/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">wrote</a></span> one player on the game’s subreddit. “The heavy battle-damage across the suit and armor plates adds so much depth to the lethal super-soldier visage.” Another <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideSquadGaming/comments/1h88rrm/of_all_the_characters_they_could_have_added/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideSquadGaming/comments/1h88rrm/of_all_the_characters_they_could_have_added/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">joked</a></span>, “Of all the characters they could have added, Condiment King, Slipknot who can climb anything, Kite Woman, Harley Quinn’s former roommate from college, Dr. Penelope Young’s rotted corpse, why did they choose a popular character like Deathstroke?”</p><p><em>Suicide Squad</em>’s end-game has been evolving ever since the conclusion of its main campaign left players frustrated and disappointed. A seasonal storytelling structure setting up events that would seemingly see the Justice League eventually brought back into the picture has brought us the Joker,  Mrs. Freeze (a gender-swap of the icy villain), and Deadshot’s daughter Lawless. Despite some big updates, new loot, and the expanding roster’s unique traversal and combat abilities, the lack of great missions or interesting boss fights has made the post-launch roadmap a bumpy one. </p><p><em>Suicide Squad</em> was <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/suicide-squad-kill-justice-league-steam-sale-1851710954?_gl=1*16ond2w*_ga*MzQzNjkwNDM2LjE2NDY2NjQ1NzQ.*_ga_V4QNJTT5L0*MTczMzUwNzk4My45NC4xLjE3MzM1MTgyNjEuNTcuMC4w&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/suicide-squad-kill-justice-league-steam-sale-1851710954?_gl=1*16ond2w*_ga*MzQzNjkwNDM2LjE2NDY2NjQ1NzQ.*_ga_V4QNJTT5L0*MTczMzUwNzk4My45NC4xLjE3MzM1MTgyNjEuNTcuMC4w">recently available for just $5 on Steam</a></span>, but the always-online third-person shooter still seems destined for the eventual live-service graveyard.

A spokesperson for Warner Bros. didn’t respond to a request for comment when <em>Kotaku</em> recently inquired if an offline mode was still on track for this year. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideSquadGaming/comments/1h6dkex/offline_mode/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideSquadGaming/comments/1h6dkex/offline_mode/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Players are hopeful that, despite radio silence</a></span> on the feature for months, the fact that it’s still promised on <em>Suicide Squad</em>’s website means it’s still coming, eventually. </p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
