              <p>Amazon loves to push its own brands during Black Friday, and the Echo Dot always gets the deepest cuts. By selling these smart speakers at razor-thin margins-or even at a loss-Amazons ensures Alexa finds her way into as many American homes as possible. The strategy works brilliantly for the company, but it also gives shoppers some incredible deals. The <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4514/">newest Echo Dot now drops from $49 to just $31</a> which is a record low price found only on Amazon.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4514/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>The Best Sounding Echo Dot Ever Made</h2>
<p>Amazon says this is the <strong>best-sounding Echo Dot they’ve ever made</strong>, and the difference is actually appreciable: clearer vocals, deeper bass, and altogether punchier sound well above its weight class. Music fills a bedroom or office surprisingly well for something this small. Previous Echo Dot generations sounded thin and tinny in comparison. The audio upgrade alone justifies replacing older models you might have scattered around the house.</p>



<p><strong>Alexa integration</strong> makes this speaker a genuinely useful daily assistant: ask for the weather while you get dressed, set timers while you cook, or get quick answers to random questions throughout the day. The voice recognition works reliably from across the room, even with music playing. You can even tap the top to snooze your morning alarm when you need a few extra minutes.</p>
<p>Music streaming connects to all of the services you probably already use. <strong>Amazon Music, Apple Music, Spotify, among others, all work seamlessly through voice commands</strong>. Bluetooth connectivity lets you stream from any device when you want manual control. You can fill your entire home with synchronized music by pairing multiple Echo devices in different rooms. The ecosystem grows naturally as you add more speakers over time.</p>
<p>Smart home control makes the Echo Dot a<strong> central hub for any connected device</strong>: lights, thermostats, plugs, and many more accessories follow your every simple command. With its built-in motion sensor, routines can be automatically invoked as soon as you turn up in a room. The indoor temperature sensor allows you to create comfort-based automation, where you start the fan once it gets too hot.</p>



<p>Privacy controls certainly help mitigate these concerns about always-listening devices. The dedicated microphone off button physically disconnects the mics when you need guaranteed privacy. Amazon has built layers of protection into the system, stating explicitly that they do not sell your personal information. You can review and delete voice recordings at any time through the Alexa app, a big improvement over previous models in terms of data transparency.</p>
<p>Pairing options extend the functionality well beyond basic speaker duties. Pair with Fire TV devices for a home theater-like audio experience, link with compatible Eero mesh systems to extend Wi-Fi coverage throughout the house, and create speaker groups that play synchronized audio across multiple rooms. The Echo Dot works great on its own but really shines as part of a larger system.</p>
<p>At $31, the Echo Dot introduces smart home capability for a near-disposable price. In one small package, you’re getting better audio quality, Alexa integration, smart home control, and integrated sensors. This Black Friday deal brings the newest model to its lowest recorded price.</p>

              <p>Apple’s AirPods Pro have dominated the premium earbud conversation for years, but Samsung finally built a serious challenger. The <strong>Galaxy Buds 3 Pro pack AI-powered noise cancellation, adaptive sound optimization, and a completely redesigned fit</strong> into a sleek package. The kicker is the price: <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4703/">At $159 instead of $249 on Amazon, these earbuds now cost almost half what Apple charges for the AirPods Pro</a>. This Black Friday deal exists only on Amazon since Samsung isn’t running this discount on its own website.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4703/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>AI-Powered Audio That Learns How You Listen</h2>
<p>The <strong>Galaxy Buds 3 Pro put AI right inside your ears</strong>, exactly where it needs to be, in ways that matter most. Adaptive Equalizer in Samsung’s earbuds analyzes the shape of your ear canal and adjusts the audio output for the best sound delivery. What you get is a kind of personalized listening that automatically improves from how the earbuds are fitted in your ears. You don’t have to fiddle with EQ settings or guess which preset sounds best as the AI does everything for you and gets it just right.</p>



<p><strong>Adaptive Active Noise Cancellation</strong> is another strong suit for Galaxy AI. It continuously monitors your environment and adjusts the cancellation intensity in real time. Louder subway noise will trigger maximum blocking, while a quiet office gets lighter treatment. The transition happens seamlessly without any need for you to manually change it. You can stay immersed in your music while remaining aware of important sounds with ease.</p>
<p>The redesigned fit addresses one of the biggest complaints about previous Galaxy Buds generations: Samsung <strong>reworked the shape and materials for long-lasting comfort</strong> during extended listening sessions. The earbuds stay secure during workouts and commutes without creating pressure points. You can wear them for hours without that fatigue from cheaper earbuds.</p>



<p>Sound quality is top-notch and delivers on the promise of this premium tier. Rich bass, clear mids, and crisp highs seamlessly come together in immersive audio across each genre. The dual drivers take everything from podcasts to orchestral music with amazing accuracy. Supporting spatial audio adds three-dimensional depth to compatible content. Movies and games feel more immersive when the sounds seem to be coming from every direction.</p>
<p><strong>Touch controls are responsive</strong> and allow you to customize actions to your liking. Tap or swipe to pause playback, skip tracks, adjust volume, take calls, and more. You can program different gestures on each earbud to make the most of the functionality. Controls reliably work, even when you are working out and your fingers are a bit sweaty. Voice assistants are just one tap away if you need hands-free assistance.</p>
<p>Battery life keeps the music going through long days without anxiety.: The earbuds give you hours of playback with ANC enabled, and the case offers multiple additional charges. Quick charging gets you back to listening fast when you’re running low. Wireless charging support means that you can drop the case onto any compatible pad. USB-C handles wired charging when you need it.</p>
<p>The Galaxy Buds 3 Pro go for $159 and offers flagship features at a mid-segment price tag. You’re getting AI-powered ANC, adaptive sound optimization, premium comfort, and striking design all rolled into one. This Black Friday deal on Amazon saves you $90 off regular pricing, but more importantly, cuts the AirPods Pro by a significant margin.</p>

              <p>Amazon started <em>Black Friday Week</em> off with a bang on Thursday by knocking the AirPods 4 with ANC down from its usual $179 to $109. Shoppers jumped on it immediately, but Amazon decided to go even harder on Friday: <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4602/">Now the price is at an unbelievable $99 (44% off)</a>, a record low for earbuds that are barely into their first year. The standard <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3769/">AirPods 4 without ANC also hit a new low at $79, down from $129</a>. Neither of these deals exists on Apple’s website because it will not run Black Friday promotions. Amazon clearly has different plans.</p>

<h2>Premium ANC Earbuds Finally at an Accessible Price</h2>
<p>Until Apple figured it out, active noise cancellation seemed impossible on open-ear earbuds with the H2 chip. The <strong>ANC model of AirPods 4 blocks out the ambient noise without the sealed feeling of traditional in-ear designs</strong>. Airplane engines, office chatter, and street noise fade into the background so you can focus on your music or calls. The technology adapts continuously to your environment, adjusting cancellation levels in real time.</p>



<p><strong>Transparency mode flips the script</strong> when you need to hear your surroundings. A quick press lets in ambient sound so you can have a conversation or listen for announcements without removing the earbuds. The transition between ANC and Transparency is genuinely instant and seamless. It’s this flexibility that makes the AirPods 4 truly useful for everyday life, rather than just an isolated listening session.</p>
<p><strong>Adaptive Audio goes even further:</strong> it automatically blends noise cancellation and transparency, depending on your environment. Walk down a busy street, and it ramps up awareness of your surroundings. Sit at your desk, and stronger noise cancellation kicks in to help you focus. In essence, the earbuds read the room and adapt-without any input from you. It feels almost magical once you experience how seamlessly it works.</p>
<p>With <strong>Personalized Spatial Audio</strong>, an immersive three-dimensional soundstage is built around your uniquely shaped ears. Technology utilizes the TrueDepth camera on your iPhone to scan your ears and optimize audio delivery. Movies and music acquire depth and dimension that standard stereo simply cannot match. It feels like the sounds are around you, not inside of your head. Immersive audio will enormously improve the gaming and video content.</p>



<p>All these advanced features are powered by the <strong>H2 chip</strong>, and it does so with great battery efficiency. You get up to 30 hours of total listening time with the charging case, ample for a week of commutes and workouts. The earbuds themselves will last around 6 hours on a single charge with ANC turned on. When you’re in a real hurry, a quick 5-minute charge gives you about an hour of playback.</p>
<p><strong>Comfort remains a strong suit for the open-ear design</strong> that Apple has refined generation after generation. The earbuds sit securely without creating pressure or fatigue during extended listening sessions. No silicone tips means no irritation in the ear canal, no plugged-up feeling. And most people can wear them hours on end without discomfort. The fit works for workouts, commutes, and everything in between.</p>
<p>For $99, the Apple AirPods 4 with ANC deliver flagship audio features at a mid-range price point. You are getting active noise cancelation, adaptive audio, spatial audio, and the H2 chip in comfortable open-ear earbuds.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/no-mans-sky-corvette-independence-day-ship-build-2000646306</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/someone-built-the-independence-day-ship-in-no-man%E2%80%99s-sky-and-it%E2%80%99s-as-terrifying-as-it-is-awesome.1361323/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Since <i>No Man’s Sky</i>’s Voyagers update, players have been obsessed with making some incredible ships. And with the help of some mod tools, the most daring of ship builders out there are pushing the boundaries of Hello Games’ procedurally created universe. One of the most impressive demonstrations I’ve seen of this yet is this <i>NMS</i> player’s tribute to <i>Independence Day</i>.</p>    <p>Built by Vilxir, this build is reminiscent of his epic, and perhaps equally terrifying, <i>No Man’s Sky</i> <a href="https://kotaku.com/no-mans-sky-voyagers-death-star-star-wars-2000635367">Death Star I highlighted last month</a>. Like the Death Star before it, Vilxir’s <i>Independence Day </i>“Destroyer” leveraged the power of open-source 3D modeling software Blender and the handy <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/nomanssky/mods/984">Base Builder mod</a> that allows users to import 3D models from Blender into <i>No Man’s Sky</i>.</p>

 <p>While <i>NMS</i>’ in-game ship-building tools can produce incredible results, Vilxir tells me that the ability to use Blender is a game-changer, “Blender has opened up an entirely new level of creativity for me. It lets me make things I genuinely didn’t think were possible in <i>NMS</i>, so huge shoutouts to the creators of the Blender Plugin and the Base Editor.”</p>

 <figure id="attachment_2000646307" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000646307"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000646307">© Screenshot: Hello Games / Vilxir</figcaption></figure> <p>The Destroyer took about four hours to build, according to Vilxir. One of the most interesting challenges? Nailing the dome-like flying saucer structure of the <i>Independence Day </i>ship. “Anyone who’s made a dome in <i>No Man’s Sky</i> or worked with Blender spheres knows the pain,” he told me. “You get merged pieces, overlaps, and a bumpy surface. To get something closer to a smooth dome, I had to build it in individual layered rings instead of using a single sphere.”</p>

 <p>Impressive though it may be, the ship isn’t finished. Vilxir now has his sights set on building out the interior of the ship, but he’s not looking to crash anyone’s console or PC with aggressively complicated ship architecture. “I’m aiming for something optimized for performance and fun, especially if I share it publicly,” he said. “Right now my plan is to build dedicated spaces for the core, the hangar, and a command deck. I also want to experiment with making a separate Corvette that acts as a small fleet of the fighter ships that Will Smith and the others flew in the movie.”</p> <p>Vilxir’s reign of building impressive ships to stalk the procedurally generated vacuum of Hello Games’ galaxy won’t conclude with the Destroyer. “For the next big project,” he told me, “I’m considering tackling Thanos’ Sanctuary II, or the Crimson Dawn ‘First Light’ yacht from <i>Solo</i>. I’ve also thought about the Lucrehulk battleship from <i>The Clone Wars</i>. My goal is to build ships that nobody has tried yet, or that hasn’t been done at this level of detail.”</p>
