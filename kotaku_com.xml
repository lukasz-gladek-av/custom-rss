But it’s the first time the company has had the reality-bending idea of somehow creating a three-way conversion. I’m not sure science can truly support this thing’s existence. I’m not entirely sure this plush isn’t mentioned in the Book of Revelation.</p><figure id="" data-id="dded010193a8487890b41b825d98fd06" data-recommend-id="image://dded010193a8487890b41b825d98fd06" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="All three plushies with arrows between." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="All three plushies with arrows between." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->The Pokémon Company / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="dded010193a8487890b41b825d98fd06" data-recommend-id="image://dded010193a8487890b41b825d98fd06" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="All three plushies with arrows between." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>I initially figured the first two stages were hidden inside the third, which would introduce its own entirely new set of concerns. But no, this is something else, something that, even looking at the images, I don’t quite understand.

All of which makes the $90 price for an 8" by 15" toy a little difficult to justify. Unless, of course, you chose to display it in its triforce form, perhaps to scare away neighborhood children or persistent poltergeists.</p><p>.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://kotaku.com/pokemon-center-plush-geodude-graveler-golem-cave-1851785591]]></content:encoded>
