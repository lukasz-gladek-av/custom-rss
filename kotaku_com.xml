Some of these features were announced a while ago but are finally making their way to the game with this update which, it seems, is currently a few months out. Larian is looking to do some stress testing on Patch 8 for all platforms in January, so it sounds like the update will roll out to everyone later next year. Larian has outlined most of the new features coming to <em>Baldur’s Gate 3 </em>in a <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1086940/view/4461474037375172735'&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1086940/view/4461474037375172735'" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">lengthy Steam post</a></span>, so let’s unpack what’s coming.<br></p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="194214" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="Elden Ring's Top Five Spells, According To FromSoftWare's Stats" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="315" data-playlist="194214,197298,197284" data-current="194214"><div><p>Elden Ring's Top Five Spells, According To FromSoftWare's Stats</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/194214/194214_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/194214/194214_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/194214/194214_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/194214/194214_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/19689.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>The biggest new feature is crossplay functionality, which the game has desperately needed as its audience is split across PC, Mac, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series X/S. It doesn’t sound like there will be any limitations once the feature goes live, and you’ll be able to make cross-platform co-op lobbies no matter where you’re playing <em>Baldur’s Gate 3</em>.</p><p>Alongside crossplay, the other big feature coming in Patch 8 is photo mode. If you’re anything like me, someone who takes well over 1500 screenshots every time he plays a video game, this is probably music to your ears. Thankfully, it looks like Larian is putting together a really robust photo mode for <em>Baldur’s Gate 3</em>, including the typical camera, lens, and frame options, as well as more thorough options like the ability to pose your characters to create a dramatic or funny scene.</p><p>For the gameplay mechanic sickos, Larian is also introducing a major overhaul to subclasses, which will introduce a new subclass for each base class in the game. For a breakdown of each, check out Larian’s full rundown below:</p><h2 id="h189860"><a id=""></a><strong>Bard - College of Glamour</strong></h2><p>As a College of Glamour Bard, you’ll find you have the power to heal friends and command enemies in equal measure. Cast <strong>Mantle of Inspiration </strong>to bestow your allies with 5 temporary hit points. And should an enemy attack while it is cast, they’ll find themselves <strong>Charmed</strong>. Play your hand correctly and you’ll be able to use this to your advantage with <strong>Mantle of Majesty</strong>. Target Charmed enemies and you can command them to flee, move closer, freeze, drop to the ground, or drop their weapon.</p><h2 id="h189861"><a id=""></a><strong>Barbarian - Path of Giants</strong></h2><p>Opt for the Path of Giants, and your newfound giant strength will make it easier for you to yeet friend and foe alike. Forget chugging potions to pump those muscles, these Barbarians benefit from the <strong>Giant’s Rage </strong>passive that grants both strength and size - allowing you to deal additional damage with Throw attacks. Pockets weighing you down? Not for you and your increased carry capacity!</p><h2 id="h189862"><a id=""></a><strong>Cleric - Death Domain</strong></h2><p>As a cleric of death, you’ll find a few dark new tricks up your sleeves - from spells that specialise in necrotic damage to three new necromancy cantrips. This includes <strong>Toll The Dead</strong>, a cantrip that causes 1~8 damage when your cleric rings the bell of impending doom - a number that scales if your target has already been damaged. We’ve also added the homebrewed ability to explode nearby corpses, damaging enemies.</p><h2 id="h189863"><a id=""></a><strong>Druid - Circle of Stars</strong></h2><p>These Druids look to the stars for answers, accessing powers beyond those offered through the classic wildshapes. Taking on one of three <strong>Starry Forms </strong>for their power - the constellations of the Archer, Chalice, and Dragon. Each one favours a different play style and strategy - the Archer dealing radiant damage with astral arrows, the life-giving Chalice restoring hitpoints to you and others nearby, and the wise Dragon, allowing you to deal damage with an added bonus to constitution rolls. The Starry Forms offer not just a celestial aesthetic, but practical, powerful options to enhance your role as a healer, fighter, or strategist.</p><h2 id="h189864"><a id=""></a><strong>Paladin - Oath of the Crown</strong></h2><p>You’ve been sworn to uphold the principles of law. Stay true to your oath and you’ll be rewarded with the power to aid your allies and disrupt your foes. Guide your companions in battle with <strong>Righteous Clarity</strong>, taunt enemies with strategic interrupts, and keep your party standing strong with <strong>Divine Allegiance</strong>, absorbing their damage while restoring their health.</p><h2 id="h189865"><a id=""></a><strong>Fighter - Arcane Archer</strong></h2><p>Mastering the dual arts of magic and marksmanship, the Arcane Archer subclass offers unique skills on top of new shooting animations. Banish foes to the Feywild, removing them from the battlefield for a turn, or unleash Psychic damage that forces enemies to make a Wisdom saving throw or be blinded until the start of their next turn.</p><h2 id="h189866"><a id=""></a><strong>Monk - Drunken Master</strong></h2><p>Putting the brew in homebrew, as the Drunken Master, you have the ability to consume alcohol straight from your inventory, as well as drink from bottles you see around the Sword Coast, in order to recover Ki. By sharing the bottle with your enemies using <strong>Intoxicating Strike</strong>, you’ll generate a buff towards your Armour Class and your Chance to hit Drunk targets. Drunk enemies are also susceptible to the Drunken Masters’ other abilities, like <strong>Sobering Realisation</strong>- which sobers up drunk targets, dealing physical and Psychic damage.</p><h2 id="h189867"><a id=""></a><strong>Ranger - Swarmkeeper</strong></h2><p>The Swarmkeeper subclass provides Rangers with three kinds of deadly swarms to assist them in combat. The <strong>Cloud of Jellyfish </strong>deals extra lightning damage - potentially shocking your enemy. <strong>The Flurry of Moths </strong>deals Psychic damage, giving you the potential to Blind your enemy. The <strong>Legion of Bees </strong>deals piercing damage and forces the enemy to make a strength-saving throw or be knocked back 15ft. Each swarm also has the ability to provide you with teleportation capabilities!</p><h2 id="h189868"><a id=""></a><strong>Rogue - Swashbuckler</strong></h2><p>This Rogue subclass introduces a range of new actions fit for the piratical life. Play dirty by tossing sand at enemies to <strong>Blind </strong>them. Flick your weapon at a target to <strong>Disarm </strong>them. Or use your new <strong>Fancy Footwork </strong>passive while meleeing your enemy to ensure they can’t make opportunity attacks against you for the rest of your turn.</p><h2 id="h189869"><a id=""></a><strong>Sorcerer - Shadow Magic</strong></h2><p>As a Shadow Magic Sorcerer, you deal in a form of magic that makes you deadliest in darkness. This subclass gives its sorcerer <strong>Superior Darkvision</strong>, as well as the ability to <strong>Shadow Walk </strong>between places of dim light or darkness. It also lets you call forth the perfectly homebrewed <strong>Hound of Ill Omen </strong>to harass your foes, and use <strong>Strength of the Grave </strong>to prevent you from being downed - ideal for those attempting Honour Mode runs.</p><h2 id="h189870"><a id=""></a><strong>Warlock - Hexblade</strong></h2><p>Hexblade Warlocks make a pact with an entity from the Shadowfell that manifests in the form of magical weapons. Curse your enemies and force their souls to do your bidding. Slay any enemy that isn’t generally an element of nature, construct, giant blob, or already dead, and you’ll be able to raise their spirit from their corpse for ten turns. This new summon can deal necrotic damage and will rip away a chunk of your enemy’s soul to provide your Hexblade Warlock with healing.<br></p><h2 id="h189871"><a id=""></a><strong>Wizard - Bladesinging</strong></h2><p>The Bladesinging subclass merges swordplay with wizardry. Expect new spellcasting animations when casting spells with your weapon, a new Bladesong ability to grant you supernatural speed, agility, and focus, plus gives you a bonus to any Constitution saving throw you make.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Keep in mind this isn’t the full list; that will be revealed later next month. </p><p>The big news is that, as part of the company’s continuing 30th anniversary celebration, Sony is adding even more PS2 games to its Classics Catalog in December. These older PS1, PS2, PS3, and PSP games are only available to PS Plus Premium subscribers. </p><p>And this time around, Sony is completing the OG <em>Sly Cooper</em> trilogy with the addition of <em>Sly 2</em> and <em>Sly 3,</em> the best games in the series. Back in May, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/playstation-2-classics-ps4-ps5-tomb-raider-star-wars-1851503467&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/playstation-2-classics-ps4-ps5-tomb-raider-star-wars-1851503467">Sony added the original <em>Sly Cooper</em></a></span>. Since then, I’ve wondered when or if these other two games would arrive. It’s nice to see some of the best platformers ever released on the PS2 finally playable on PS4 and PS5. It’s easier than ever to play through these colorful platformers about a thieving, talking raccoon stealing valuable items from criminals around the world while avoiding the police. </p><p>It’s a shame that these are just so-so emulated versions of the PS2 games and not the much better-looking and playing PS3 remasters, but <em>Sly Cooper</em> fans will take what they can get at this point. (Oh, and <em>Jak and Daxter</em> is being added too, which is nice.) </p><p>The last game that needs to be added is 2013's <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/lets-take-a-look-at-a-playstation-game-pitch-1847183157&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/lets-take-a-look-at-a-playstation-game-pitch-1847183157"><em>Sly Cooper: Thieves in Time</em></a></span><em>.</em> That would make the entire series playable on PS4 and PS5. Sadly, that game was released on PS3 and, as such, won’t be playable natively on either platform, so if it arrived at all, it would be as a streaming title. Still, like I said, <em>Sly </em>fans will take what they can get. </p><p>Meanwhile, starting December 3, <em>all</em> PlayStation Plus subscribers will be able to grab <em>It Takes Two</em>, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/temtem-pokemon-mmo-end-development-1851310155&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/temtem-pokemon-mmo-end-development-1851310155"><em>TemTem</em></a></span>, and <em>Aliens: Dark Descent </em>as part of the month’s free games.</p><p> <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/it-takes-two-creates-an-almost-perfect-union-of-story-a-1846576907&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/it-takes-two-creates-an-almost-perfect-union-of-story-a-1846576907">Co-op puzzler <em>It Takes Two</em></a></span> is a perfect game to grab during the holidays as you and a family member visiting for a few days can easily beat it in a weekend while gorging on leftovers and booze.

When there’s a special version that features designs from a popular game, or celebrates an anniversary, it gets a lot of attention, and by design, too few are made to meet demand. They exist to cause FOMO, and see collectors scrambling to spend hundreds or thousands of dollars to get another version of a thing they likely already have, while anyone who just fancies getting a new device that features their favorite IP is most likely to fail. It’s therefore massive advertising for the product, and very likely leads to further sales of the ordinary, vanilla versions after people discover they cannot get the new, prettier case. So yeah: because capitalism, no duh, etc. But when this extends to literally just a different plain color, it’s <em>idiotic</em>.</p><figure id="" data-id="eb806ba916b89f0f5d3c10dd340443ae" data-recommend-id="image://eb806ba916b89f0f5d3c10dd340443ae" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="720" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The very white PS Portal, showing Astrobot on its screen." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="The very white PS Portal, showing Astrobot on its screen." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Try to imagine this in another color!

The limit is entirely self-imposed by the creators, for the reasons given above, with the rationale that people will feel special for owning something that others cannot get. There are many who will defend the forced shortages of stock for a version of their favorite peripheral designed to look like R2-D2 or what have you, as it’s only special because there aren’t many of them, and around the circular logic goes. It strikes me as a sucky way to make yourself feel good, but we all crave rarity and the status it brings, and I’m not here to argue against that today. I’m here because that goes from odd to just inexplicable when it comes to something being black instead of white.</p><p>Yes, absolutely, it costs a bit more money for a company to make more than one color of their hardware. It’s a different production line run, with different inks, and then requires different packaging. But oh good grief, it’s <em>negligible</em> when you’re Sony or Valve or whoever it is trying to imply they’ve discovered the Ark of the Covenant because they produced a different run of plastic cases. And the reality that it doesn’t need to be this way is no better proven than by one particular producer of plastic peripherals: Nintendo.</p><p>Gosh, yes, we’re not here today to rag on the litigious behemoth, because when it comes to offering a range of colors without artificial scarcity, it’s hard to fault Nintendo! And that’s been the case as far back as I can remember. Game Boys were sold with six alternative colors than the regular grey, and this trend of readily available variety continued through the Game Boy Advance, Advance SP, and all iterations of the DS, all with so many colors to chose from, and most of them always available.</p><p>Come the Switch and it got even better! Sure, the screen usually comes just with a plain black bevel, but it’s all about the color of the Joy-Cons, which offer so much variety, along with the option to mix and match. Heck, it was a defining feature of the launch model, with its red and blue defaults. It’s enough that when my kid has friends round for a big <em>Fortnite</em> or <em>Minecraft</em> game, there’s no confusion over whose is whose, given they’re all essentially a different color. Let alone the Switch Lite, which launched in a variety of colors, and even still sells <em>Zelda</em> and <em>Animal Crossing</em> special versions years after they were released.</p><figure id="" data-id="f74bd27d0efbbfce5c2d60ab89cec3df" data-recommend-id="image://f74bd27d0efbbfce5c2d60ab89cec3df" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="720" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Three Switch Lites, in pink, blue and yellow." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Three Switch Lites, in pink, blue and yellow." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Nintendo / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="f74bd27d0efbbfce5c2d60ab89cec3df" data-recommend-id="image://f74bd27d0efbbfce5c2d60ab89cec3df" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="720" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Three Switch Lites, in pink, blue and yellow." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>That strikes me as what should be normal. Pretending that a console or a peripheral can only come in one color, at least until the planets align and the spirits allow a special alternative to appear until the next blood moon, is utterly ridiculous, and removes one of the most important things a customer wants: choice.</p><p>What’s weirder still is that this false scarcity creates two secondary markets, neither of which benefits the companies imposing the limits. There’s the scalping market, where people scoop up as many of the special editions as they can and then resell them for vastly higher prices, which of course does nothing to benefit the original manufacturer. Then there’s the third-party accessories market, where entirely separate companies sell faceplates and cases that provide excellent variety for people who want a distinct and colorful device, but usually at the cost of voiding any warranty as they precariously remove screws they were never intended to touch. And, again, not one cent of that money ever reaches the company making the original product.</p><figure id="" data-id="164261c1f86f253d3b86325e0e7312d2" data-recommend-id="image://164261c1f86f253d3b86325e0e7312d2" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="720" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="An explosion of paint in many different colors." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="An explosion of paint in many different colors." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="getty" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Don Farrall<!-- --> (<!-- -->Getty Images<!-- -->)</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="164261c1f86f253d3b86325e0e7312d2" data-recommend-id="image://164261c1f86f253d3b86325e0e7312d2" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="720" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="An explosion of paint in many different colors." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>The main result of it all seems to be disappointment. Sure, it’s great for the few who were lucky enough to get to the front of queues that last literally minutes before selling out. But they’re the few! The majority are left bummed out, and unless they’re rich/stupid enough to massively overpay to scummy scalpers, there’s no recourse! “No,” said the massive corporation, “You may <em>not</em> have the product you wanted to give us money for. Because...of the reasons.”</p><p>Just sell your product in seven colors! It’s not that complicated! It’s a Photoshop color-shift for your packaging design, and a few extra pennies on the cost of the device for the extra paint. How do I know they can? Because Nintendo does it for every device, and they <em>all </em>do it for their controllers! </p><p>Right now, to use an incredibly trivial example, I have a black TV above a black shelving unit, and a white Xbox Series S and a monstrous white original PS5. It looks rubbish! I’d have bought both in black if I could. I should have been able to. I certainly shouldn’t have to read the gaming news every hour to see if Sony is announcing a seven-second window in which they’ll sell a non-white version of a device to the fastest bots.</p><p>Although, if I’m being more honest, what I actually want is everything in purple. Purple GameCube, I love you. I’ll always love you.</p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
