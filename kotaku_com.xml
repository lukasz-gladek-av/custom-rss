              <p>If you happen to be on the hunt for a new laptop, whether that’s because you’re a student in need of something to complete assignments, a small business owner looking to handle your business needs, or just some guy looking to watch YouTube and draw pictures, come check out the Dell Inspiron 15. This laptop has a touchscreen and is bundled with some bonus accessories. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4388/">The Amazon listing has the full price set at $2,200, but the limited time deal indicates its been marked down by 64% to just $800</a>. Some quick napkin math will tell you that’s a $1,400 discount.</p>
<p>You might be thinking that’s absolutely ridiculous. How can this laptop be on sale for that much off? Well, you’re right to be suspicious. When we look at this bundle’s price history, we can see it has only existed on Amazon for about a month. After first being listed, it immediately dropped in price and it’s mostly been at that $800 amount since.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4388/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<p>Lots of sellers on Amazon will artificially inflate the list price so that when they mark it down, the sale looks enormous. Even if we go to Dell’s website, we’ll find versions of this model laptop going for about the same as you find it here. All that said, this is a pretty good value.</p>
<p>What you’re getting is a 15.6-inch touchscreen laptop that’s powered by the AMD Ryzen 7 7730U. With that we also have an integrated graphics card, 32GB of memory, and a full 1TB of internal storage on its SSD. This laptop is designed to be able to take on school, work, entertainment, and any other sort of everyday task an average user might encounter — and it’s got the specs to support that.</p>
<p>The screen’s touch controls allow you to operate the laptop as if it’s a tablet, choosing to use pinch, zoom, and swipe gestures like you would on a mobile device. It has a resolution of 1080p and uses an anti-glare coating to help minimize reflections, making for more comfortable viewing in bright settings.</p>



<h2>Bonus Gifts Included</h2>
<p>Along with the laptop, you also get a number of free accessories. This Dell Inspiron 15 comes with a stylus pen to be used on the touchscreen, a cleaning clothe, a laptop sleeve for traveling, a USB flash drive with 128GB on it, as well as some port covers and webcam covers. Plus, the laptop comes pre-installed with Windows 11 Pro.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4388/">Right now, you can get the Dell Inspiron 15 and all these goodies for just $800.</a></p>

              <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/just-cause-3-the-kotaku-review-1745359451"><em>Just Cause</em></a> and <em>Mad Max</em> developer Avalanche Studios is closing up a studio in the United Kingdom and is laying off an undisclosed number of employees due to “current challenges to our business and the industry.”</p> <p>On September 30, <a href="https://avalanchestudios.com/stories/studio-update">Avalanche Studios Group posted a short update</a> on the company’s official site announcing that its UK development studio in Liverpool is being closed and that all employees will be “impacted.” Avalanche also confirmed in the same statement that layoffs are planned for its Swedish studios located in Malmö and Stockholm. The news of layoffs and a studio closure comes about two months after Avalanche and Xbox announced that the upcoming game <em>Contraband</em> was canceled.</p> <p>Here’s Avalanche’s full statement as posted online:</p> <blockquote><p>In light of current challenges to our business and the industry, we have thoroughly reviewed how to best ensure Avalanche Studios Group’s long-term success. This review has led us to the difficult conclusion that we must make changes to our staffing and locations. As a result, we are proposing to close our Liverpool studio, and to initiate a collective consultation process, as required by UK law. This will impact all Avalanchers in Liverpool. The changes will also impact our other studio locations in Malmö and Stockholm, where we will reduce our workforce and restructure the teams to address our games’ needs.</p> <p>Our immediate focus is to offer full support to all Avalanchers during this challenging time. Despite these changes, we remain deeply committed to providing amazing games to our passionate player communities.</p></blockquote> <p><em>Contraband</em> was first announced back in 2021 and was going to be published by Xbox and developed primarily by Avalanche’s studio in Liverpool. However, four years later, we had heard very little about the game and its status. <a href="https://kotaku.com/just-cause-makers-xbox-exclusive-contraband-canceled-amid-recent-cuts-2000616371">In August 2025</a>, Xbox and Avalanche announced what most people expected: Development on <em>Contraband</em> was being halted as the studio “evaluated” the future of the game and its plans moving forward. And while the game isn’t mentioned directly in the statement above, it appears those involved with the evaluation have settled on layoffs.</p> <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/candy-crush-ai-king-microsoft-layoffs-xbox-farm-saga-1851786283">This is just one</a> of <a href="https://kotaku.com/game-industry-layoffs-how-many-2024-unity-twitch-1851155818">many, many, many layoffs</a> to <a href="https://kotaku.com/latest-round-of-mass-layoffs-at-xbox-begin-with-200-job-1851785492">happen in the video game industry</a> over the last few years as it becomes more expensive to develop bigger games and harder than ever to get people to play them, as titles like <a href="https://kotaku.com/old-games-2023-playtime-data-fortnite-roblox-minecraft-1851382474"><em>Fortnite, GTA Online, Call of Duty, </em>and <em>Roblox</em></a> dominate the charts. <a href="https://kotaku.com/marvel-rivals-netease-game-director-layoffs-season-2-1851765290">And even if your game is a big hit</a>, <a href="https://kotaku.com/oblivion-remastered-virtuos-layoffs-cyberpunk-patch-1851786435">that doesn’t mean you’re safe.</a></p>
