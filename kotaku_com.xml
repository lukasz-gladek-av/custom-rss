              <p>The holiday season is here, and to celebrate the most festive time of year, PlayStation is offering all PlayStation Plus subscribers extra games to download and play in December. ‘Tis the season and all that.</p> <p><a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/11/26/playstation-plus-monthly-games-for-december-lego-horizon-adventures-killing-floor-3-the-outlast-trials-more/">On November 26, PlayStation revealed December’s monthly games</a> that will be available to all PS Plus subscribers across all tiers. These games will be available to add to your PlayStation library permanently on December 2. Once added, you can install them and play them whenever you want as long as you are an active PS Plus Essential, Extra, or Premium subscriber. Here’s the list of games and what platforms they are available on.</p> <ul> <li><em>LEGO Horizon Adventures</em> – PS5</li> <li><em>Killing Floor 3</em> – PS5</li> <li><em>The Outlast Trials</em> – PS4, PS5</li> <li><em>Synduality Echo of Ada</em> – PS5</li> <li><em>Neon White</em> – PS4, PS5</li> </ul> <p>You don’t want to wait too long to grab these PS Plus monthly games, as they are only available to grab for free until January 5.</p> <p>This is one of the better months for PS Plus in some time<em>.<a href="https://kotaku.com/neon-white-pc-nintendo-switch-annapurna-interactive-got-1849072088"> Neon White</a></em> alone makes this a fantastic list of games. Its fast-paced platforming/shooting action is hard to put down, and the story it tells is equally engrossing. I expect many players will be fighting among friends to reach the top of the leaderboards.</p>

 <p>Meanwhile<em>, LEGO Horizon Adventures</em> is the perfect game for the holidays. If you have young kids hanging out at your house, and you can pull them away from <em>Roblox</em> for a few hours, <a href="https://kotaku.com/lego-horizon-adventures-review-aloy-ps5-switch-pc-1851696761"><em>Horizon Adventures</em></a> is a fantastic co-op game that will help keep them distracted while the adults cook, clean, and wrap last-minute gifts.</p> <p>Or maybe you want to be scared during your holiday break? Well, then I’d check ou<em>t The Outlast Trials,</em> though you might want to scooch away the kids at your house before booting that one up. And don’t forget to add November’s freebies to your PlayStation account library. You have until December 1 to grab <em>Stray, EA Sports WRC 24, </em>and <em>Totally Accurate Battle Simulator.&nbsp;</em></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Samsung enjoys a great reputation in the electronics industry, especially when it comes to its extensive lineup of tablets, ranging from affordable models to high-end models such as the Galaxy Tab S11 Ultra (that cost over $1,000). The <strong>Galaxy Tab A9+ model is placed in the budget category</strong> and provides all the basic functionalities of a tablet at an affordable cost. Now available at a record-low price on Amazon,<a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3880/"> the Black Friday offer has cut the 64GB / WiFi tablet price to $149 from the earlier cost of $219</a> and makes it the lowest-priced quality tablet in the industry.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3880/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>11-Inch Screen with 90Hz Refresh</h2>
<p>The <strong>11-inch screen means you get plenty of room to watch videos</strong>, work, and play without the bulk of larger tablets. The<strong> 90Hz refresh rate</strong> means you get even smoother animations and video compared with the typical 60Hz offered on other budget tablets. While the brightness levels are sufficient in indoor conditions, using it in direct sunlight outdoors still isn’t optimal, just like other tablets in the same price range. The tablet has an average battery performance similar to other tablets in the same range.</p>
<p>The <strong>quad-speaker audio system is boasting Dolby Atmos</strong> and provides better audio than the average tablet, courtesy of the soundstage effect. Videos and TV shows come alive with surround sound, whose audio effects help in better listening, particularly in the center. Playing tunes using the quad-speaker audio system provides better audio than the average tablet Speaker, since the audio system has separate audio inputs on the left and right side. The<strong> four speakers are optimized in a landscape setup</strong>, and allows the mobile tablet device to offer better left and right audio stereo when watching videos.</p>



<p>The improved chipset ensures there is sufficient power available for all basic needs like browsing, video watching, social networking, emails, and gaming, without the annoyance and disappointment that accompanies underperforming and budget-friendly tablets. Multiple Chrome tabs run well, video streaming occurs in high definition, and most leading mobile games run at an adequate frame rate.</p>
<p>The <em>Multi Window Display</em> feature means you can have <strong>multiple apps running at the same time in split-screen</strong> and floating window modes, making the tablet truly a productivity tool. Surf websites and jot notes in OneNote, watch videos on YouTube and respond to emails, and even cook recipes while video chatting with family. The large screen has room for up to three apps running side by side, without overcrowding each individual screen. This multitasking feature pushes the Tab A9+ beyond the territory of a consumption tablet.</p>



<p>With a <strong>thickness of only 6.9mm and a weight that measures in at 480g</strong>, there’s no denying the phone’s portability. This lightweight smartphone means that when you have to spend long periods holding the smartphone, you won’t experience much fatigue in the arms. The smartphone’s ruggedness means that you don’t have to worry about the typical drops and bumps when using the smartphone in your family.</p>
<p>The Galaxy Tab A9+ is now available for $149 and comes with features such as an 11-inch 90Hz screen, quad speakers with Dolby Atmos, a refined processor, Multi Window functionality and the ability to <strong>expand the microSD card slot</strong>, all at 32% off the normal price on this Black Friday. The reduced price put forth by Samsung provides cost-effective quality tablets, especially designed for those who are on a budget and still need functional tablets.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Black Ops 7 Multiplayer Is More Of The Same—That’s Why I’m Playing It]]></title>
            <link>https://kotaku.com/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-multiplayer-review-impressions-2000647644</link>
            <guid>1365601</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><span>Yeah, I’m playing </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-review-campaign-is-it-good-zombies-multiplayer-2000645198"><i><span>Call of Duty: Black Ops 7</span></i></a><span>. Not the weird campaign or the extra-large Zombies offering, but the multiplayer. Team Deathmatch, mostly, maybe some Kill Confirmed. A few hours a couple of days a week, ass parked on the couch, brain on autopilot, cranking some </span><i><span>CoD</span></i><span>. This describes me recently, but it could also describe versions of me stretching back more than 15 years ago.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>It’s not nostalgia as much as it’s resignation, or the quiet reliance on something familiar. </span><i><span>Halo Infinite</span></i><span> feels empty and sad. </span><i><span>Battlefield 6</span></i><span> is too big and tactical for my twitchy shooter preference. </span><i><span>Fortnite </span></i><span>and </span><i><span>Apex Legends</span></i><span> and</span><i><span> Arc Raiders</span></i><span> are much longer time sucks. In this regard, I suppose I’m Activision’s ideal consumer: a tired millennial who just wants to shoot shit quickly.</span></p>

 <p><span>When playing </span><i><span>Black Ops 7,</span></i><span> I am pulled into a parallel universe like the one from </span><i><span>Interstellar</span></i><span>. Every </span><i><span>Call of Duty</span></i><span> that has ever existed or will exist is here, and I can press all of their buttons at once. The pre-game lobby music sounds identical to the music from </span><i><span>Black Ops 6</span></i><span>, several of the Operators are from last year’s Zombies mode, and the map I’m playing on is a recreation of one from 2012’s </span><i><span>Black Ops 2</span></i><span>. Nuketown 24/7 is here, and it’s available 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. It always has been.</span></p>

 <p><span>The various bells and whistles that are supposed to make this version of </span><i><span>Call of Duty</span></i><span> worth spending another $70 on are mostly lost on me (Activision gave me a code, plus it’s on Game Pass). I sink into comfort, into the pre-made loadouts or the singular one I build myself (a kitted-out AR, Semtex, Cold-Blooded), into cooking a sticky before throwing it into a crowded room, into reloading after every shot fired to ensure I have a full clip, and I relax into repetition.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><span>I queue up in a lobby. Someone calls someone else the r-slur. I go 25 and 4. The lobby automatically queues up for another game. Someone calls someone else the f-slur. I go 18 and 9. I do this on repeat for a few hours, before dinner or bed beckons. Am I having fun? I guess?</span></p>

 <p><span>There are new things in </span><i><span>Black Ops 7</span></i><span> multiplayer, of course. The most noticeable is the wall jump, which the sweatier players have already perfected in a particularly irritating manner—imagine your standard </span><i><span>Call of Duty</span></i><span> but with the vertical leap of a </span><i><span>Halo</span></i><span> game that’s far more erratic. Skirmish, the 20v20 mode that sees players glide into a larger map on suited wings to try and capture various points, keeps me occupied for a few rounds. Then I return to TDM.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><span>The new maps are fun, but they all blur together into a vague, </span><i><span>Call of Duty-shaped</span></i><span> smear. This doesn’t deter me, though it should. Instead, I am almost soothed by the banality of it all. I realize after a particularly dominant match that, out of all the shooter franchises I’ve played throughout the years, I am most attuned to these former pseudo-mil-sims turned power fantasies. While playing </span><i><span>Black Ops 7</span></i><span>, I enter a flow state that I can’t mimic in any other game: my fingers move without me willing them to, my body relaxes like I’m neck-deep in a sauna, my eyes glaze over as if under a spell.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>Though it’s difficult to argue the artistic merits of a gigantic video game publisher annually pushing out a hoo-rah shooter (</span><a href="https://kotaku.com/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-ai-art-activision-statement-blops7-steam-ps5-2000644397"><span>with at least some help from generative AI</span></a><span>), I can’t lie and act like I’m not playing them. But like the comfort breakfast I would eat every day in elementary school to exercise some control over my life, I will eventually grow tired of this taste. First, it was Entemann’s corn muffins, then it was Eggo waffles. Now it’s </span><i><span>Black Ops 7</span></i><span>, tomorrow it might be </span><i><span>Halo Infinite </span></i><span>again. For those of us who love first-person shooters with fast queue times, the pickings are slim, and </span><i><span>Call of Duty</span></i><span> is there every year. </span></p>

            <title><![CDATA[JBL Xtreme 3 Falls Below Last Year’s Black Friday Price, Breaking Pricing Rules for Portable Speakers]]></title>
            <link>https://kotaku.com/outdoor-party-season-is-not-over-and-neither-is-this-big-amazon-deal-on-the-jbl-xtreme-3-waterproof-speaker-2000625491</link>

              <p>Even though winter has fully settled in, Black Friday isn’t the end of the celebration season. Holiday parties, cozy nights in, and even snowy trips all feel better with the right soundtrack, and now’s the perfect time to upgrade your audio with the JBL Xtreme 3 portable waterproof Bluetooth speaker. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5961/">It’s just $200 — over $130 off its regular price — during this Amazon Black Friday sale</a>.</p>
<p>The JBL Xtreme 3 is a party machine in search of a party, outdoors or inside. It’s IP67-rated waterproof and dustproof so you don’t have to scramble if a sudden rain shower pops up, and despite its compact and abundantly portable size, it brings enough high-quality volume to entertain your whole guest list and has the battery capacity to do it all day and all night.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5961/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Great Sound Guaranteed</h2>
<p>Of course the Xtreme 3 Bluetooth speaker has top-notch sound — it’s a JBL product. There’s a passive radiator at each end of the speaker for deep, powerful bass, and two sets of drivers and tweeters to handle the rest of the audio needs. It’s just a Bluetooth connection away from delivering 100W of your favorite playlist over a wide area, and it can connect to more than one at the same time so you’re not hogging the DJ duties.</p>
<p>There will be plenty of time to share, though, thanks to the Xtreme 3’s 15 hours of playtime from a single charge. And speaking of sharing, the JBL Xtreme 3 has a USB port built in that can charge a smartphone or other device while it charges up your party with great music. And if you really want to rile the neighbors, the Xtreme 3 has JBL’s PartyBoost feature so it can be paired with another compatible JBL speaker to either double your sound or create wireless stereo effects.</p>



<h2>Road Ready</h2>
<p>When you’re buying a portable Bluetooth speaker, the Bluetooth part is pretty much understood to be the same across models. But the definition of “portable” tends to vary. Rest assured, the JBL Xtreme 3 is, in fact, exceptionally portable. It’s just under a foot long and 5 inches around, and weighs slightly over 4 pounds. It’s the perfect size to tuck under your arm and carry for as long as you need to, but there’s also an included strap for even easier transportation.</p>
<p>Stand your ground against the pumpkin spice wave — summer’s not over yet! Invite your friends to the pool or the beach, and before you do that, <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5961/">smash the buy button on this great Amazon deal that drops the price of the JBL Xtreme 3 waterproof portable Bluetooth speaker by over $130, all the way down to just $200.</a></p>
