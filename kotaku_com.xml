              <p>Picking up the M5 iPad Pro for the first time should come with a wary bystander asking, “are you sure you can handle this thing,” as if you were sliding into the driver’s seat of an F1 race car. The amount of power under the hood of the newest iPad Pro is&nbsp;<em>that</em> significant, and with Black Friday week kicking off, <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5870/">Amazon is handing you the keys to the 13-inch version with a first-ever $100 price drop to $1,195.</a></p>
<p>Fortunately, learning how to harness all of the crazy amount of power and features of the M5 iPad Pro won’t end with you pancaked into a wall. If anything, you won’t be able to put it down once you see just what the upgrade to the M5 chip — the very same one found in the newest MacBooks — has done for the iPad Pro. Everything from editing 4K video, precision art creation, and heavy-duty gaming is now firmly on the table.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5870/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>More Than Enough</h2>
<p>The best reviews on iPads or any tablets has always been that they’re “good enough” to take on visually challenging or work-intensive tasks normally done by laptops or desktops. The M5 iPad Pro isn’t merely “good enough” to be your primary device for streaming, photo editing, content creation, number-crunching, or anything else — it handles them all as easily as virtually any laptop.</p>
<p>Not surprisingly, the M5 iPad Pro falls in line with pretty much every iPad ever made by having an industry-best display. The 13-inch screen is a Liquid Retina XDR thing of beauty, and it’s not going to lag or glitch out on you while you stream or edit videos or play an action game, thanks to the GPU built into the M5 chip.</p>
<p>Take a deeper dive into the Apple ecosystem by adding the Apple Pencil Pro and Magic Keyboard folio (both sold separately) and you have a truly formidable touchscreen laptop, but one that runs the clean, silky-smooth iPadOS 26, updated with Liquid Glass design, helpful widgets and improved interaction with the Apple Pencil.</p>



<h2>Best iPad Ever?</h2>
<p>Need more power? Take Apple Intelligence out for a spin to help you create and execute pro-level workflows, and the iPad Pro’s Neural Accelerators will have them up and running in no time. Browsing or streaming speed? This iPad Pro can run Wi-Fi 7 with Apple’s brand-new N1 chip to deliver stunning online speed. The landscape 12MP front camera and 12MP rear camera are top notch, and when you combine them with the elite-level built-in mics and speakers, your FaceTime calls and videoconferencing will be the best ever delivered by any iPad. There’s also a USB-C port that lets you connect to an external Thunderbolt or USB 4 monitor.</p>
<p>Call it a race car, a thoroughbred, a rocket, or any other analogy you want, and the M5 iPad Pro lives up to it. Simply put, it’s Apple’s best and by&nbsp;<em>far</em> most powerful tablet yet, and it should be at the very top of the Black Friday list for anyone who wants it all when it comes to portable smart-device power. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5870/">Hit Amazon now and grab the 13-inch M5 iPad Pro while it’s at an all-time low price of $1,195.</a></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Later this week, <a href="https://kotaku.com/battlefield-6-free-week-star-wars-fan-film-exodus-leaks-bf6-2000646871#:~:text=Battlefield%206%E2%80%B2,royale%20spin%2Doff."><em>Battlefield 6</em>‘s conquest mode and some of its maps</a> will be free to play across all platforms. That means an influx of new players. So now seems like a good time to ask everyone, even the people already playing EA’s blockbuster online FPS, to please capture control points in Conquest. Please. I’m begging you.</p> <p>I’ve been playing a lot of <a href="https://kotaku.com/battlefield-6-review-steam-ps5-campaign-multiplayer-2000633379"><em>Battlefield 6</em> since it launched in October</a>. And I’ve had a great time with it. The FPS is easily my favorite <em>Battlefield</em> in a few years and will likely be a game I return to a lot in 2026. But whenever I play Conquest, <a href="https://battlefield.fandom.com/wiki/Conquest">the franchise’s iconic mode</a> that’s been around since the OG <em>Battlefield 1942</em>, I get frustrated by how many players seem not to understand the point of the mode. That point being: Capture control points, hold and defend them, and if needed, take them back from the enemy. Hold more points, and your team will win faster. Let them control the battlefield, and you’ll lose just as quickly.</p>

 <p>Sounds simple enough, yet I’ve lost a Conquest match and skimmed the scoreboard afterward countless times, just to spot half or more of my team with zero captures.</p>  <p>Now, I understand that some people are sniping and aren’t capping points. Fine. And some are using tanks and aircraft to support the team and won’t have as many captures as some other players or me. I get that, too. My problem is that so many players who aren’t sniping or using tanks seem to just… not take control points.</p>

 <p>I’ve watched players run into the first control point at the start of a match and capture it, then just run around the next one, never going in to cap it or help their team hold it. These aren’t snipers either, but support or assault players. Other times, I see people run to an enemy base, help fight and clear it, and then leave when it’s neutralized but not fully capped. Or some players will cap a base and then never leave it.</p> <p>I don’t care if you only get three kills. I don’t care if you a dozen times. As long as you are helping our team cap points, push forward when it makes sense, and fall back when needed to defend, I’ll be happy. And you’ll likely get more XP and be higher up on the scoreboard, too, as <a href="https://kotaku.com/battlefield-6s-new-map-review-good-eastwood-big-large-ps5-pc-2000645547"><em>Battlefield 6</em></a> greatly rewards teamplay and objective support over kills. So help your team win, get to the top of the leaderboard, and have a fun time by capturing control points in <em>Battlefield 6</em>, okay? Please.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/roborock-decided-money-doesn%E2%80%99t-matter-q10-s5-robot-vacuum-drops-50-off-with-10-000pa-suction.1363030/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Roborock has become the premium brand in robot vacuums with their latest flagships such as <em>Qrevo CurvX</em>&nbsp;and <em>Saros 10R</em>&nbsp;crossing the $1,000 threshold even with Black Friday discounts. But here’s the thing: t<a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4512/">he Roborock Q5 S10+ is currently sitting at an all-time low of $259 on Amazon, down from its original $549 price tag</a>, and it’s flying off the shelves. This model packs serious technology into a mid-range package – think <strong>10,000Pa suction power, a self-emptying station that holds 70 days worth of debris, and a sonic mopping system that scrubs 3,000 times per minute</strong>. The kind of deal that makes you wonder if someone in Roborock’s pricing department made a mistake.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4512/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Best in Class Vacuum Cleaner</h2>
<p>First of all, the 10,000Pa suction power puts this vacuum in the <strong>same league as models costing twice as much</strong>. That level of suction pulls embedded pet hair out of carpet fibers, grabs crumbs from hardwood floor crevices, and handles the kind of everyday mess that accumulates a lot quicker than you’d like to admit. The HyperForce technology behind this suction isn’t just a marketing term: it’s the difference between a robot that pushes debris around and one that actually removes it.</p>
<p>The self-emptying station completely changes the way you interact with the vacuum. You are looking at a 2.7L dust bag, able to hold up to 70 days of dirt and debris, which essentially means that you can forget about emptying for over two months. This is where pet owners will appreciate it more than anyone because pet hair fills up the standard robot vacuum bins in a matter of days. The <strong>station will automatically empty the robot after each cleaning session</strong>&nbsp;so you’ll never need to deal with those pesky clouds of dust or tangled hair when manually emptying a bin.</p>



<p>The <strong>VibraRise 2.0 mopping system</strong> is where this vacuum starts to feel like a premium product. Dual-zone sonic vibration scrubs floors up to 3,000 times per minute, which is enough force to handle dried spills and stuck-on messes that regular robot mops just smear around. The mopping module automatically lifts 8mm when it detects carpet, so you’re not dealing with wet carpets or having to manually remove mop pads before running a cleaning cycle. You can adjust mopping intensity through the app depending on how dirty your floors are, giving you control without requiring manual intervention.</p>
<p>The smart carpet detection uses ultrasonic technology to identify when the vacuum moves onto carpet from hard floors. Detecting carpet, it lifts the mopping modules and automatically increases suction power for a deeper cleaning. This dual response ensures that the carpets get the aggressive cleaning they require while protecting them from water damage. It’s reliable enough that you can run cleaning cycles while away from home with no fear of returning to soaked rugs.</p>



<p>Navigation on this vacuum relies on PreciSense LiDAR technology which scans 360° to create detailed maps of your home. The system supports multi-level mapping, meaning if you have a two-story house, the vacuum remembers the layout of both floors and can plan efficient cleaning routes for each level. With ReactiveTech obstacle avoidance, structured light technology is used to detect objects in real time and navigate around them, meaning fewer situations where it gets stuck and more complete cleaning coverage without needing to pre-clean before the robot vacuum cleans.</p>
<p>At $259, this vacuum delivers technology that was reserved for $500+ models just a couple of years ago. Roborock’s reputation for build quality means you’re not sacrificing reliability to hit this price point, and the fact that it’s selling in huge volumes on Amazon suggests plenty of people have figured out this is an unusually good value.</p>

              <p>When people recall their favorite <em>Tomb Raider&nbsp;</em>games, it’s often focused on which was their first. For me, that was <em>Tomb Raider II</em>, and as such, it remains very special. For others, it’s the wonderful opener to Crystal Dynamics’ era of the franchise, <em>Tomb Raider Legends</em>. And for many more, it’ll be one of the more recent entries, like 2018’s&nbsp;<em>Shadow of the Tomb Raider</em>. But for all the reminiscing and celebrating, there’s one entry that seems to get little love, despite being one of my absolute favorites at the time, and to replay today:&nbsp;<em>Tomb Raider: Chronicles</em>. It turns 25 years old today.</p> <p>There is a perennial issue for both games and movies, which I call Critic Fatigue. It doesn’t matter how good a series may be, nor how increasingly popular it might be among audiences: at a certain point, critics seem to believe it’s their role to be sick of something. “Uh, <em>another</em> <em>Avengers</em> movie? I hate it just for existing!” “More&nbsp;<em>Assassin’s Creed</em>?! It’s time for it to be taken down a peg or two!” It’s like it’s their collective job to punish a franchise for having too many entries. That happened astoundingly harshly to&nbsp;<em>Tomb Raider</em> at the turn of the century.</p>

 <h2>Business is boobing</h2> <p>Obviously, the first three <em>Tomb Raider</em> games were a phenomenon. From 1996 to 1998, the original trilogy received international hype that today is hard to even conceive. It was a messy combination of a worthwhile celebration of three genuinely fantastic video games and the lecherous misogyny of the late-90s era. The reason an entire generation bought 3DFX cards, Lara Croft championed and emboldened the third-person action genre, <em>and</em> had rather large boobies. So yes, there <em>was</em> a lot to be frustrated by, especially in Lara’s home country of the UK, where “lad mags” ruled supreme with their soft-porn photography and lifestyle articles. This aspect was so blatantly exploited by publisher Eidos that there was always an <a href="https://www.laracroftonline.com/pictures/tomb-raider-models-images-gallery-page-one.html">“official” Lara Croft model</a>, despite these people never appearing in movies, TV shows, or any other actually extant tie-in media. Instead, the likes of Rhona Mitra, Ellen Rocche, and Nell McAndrew would show up on the covers of those lad mags with multi-page photo shoots within, and on cardboard cut-outs in every gaming store. (And on the covers of many a gaming magazine.) It’s pretty embarrassing to look back on, not least remembering how Nell McAndrew was hypocritically fired from the role after posing for <em>Playboy</em>.</p>

 <p>But for all the squirm-inducing marketing, the games remained <em>fantastic</em>. They still are. Then, in 1999, came <em>Tomb Raider: The Last Revelation</em>, and the tide started to turn. Critic Fatigue was due to kick in, and you could smell the backlash coming. <em>The Last Revelation</em> was more of the same, and for some reason, more of something we previously loved stops being good enough after a while, and scores came in lower. It wasn’t helped by a crappy Dreamcast port, but there was still enough residual love for the franchise that <em>The Last Revelation</em> escaped the brunt of the kickback. That was reserved for—in my opinion—a better game.</p>

 <figure id="attachment_2000646923" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000646923"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000646923">© Eidos</figcaption></figure> <h2>Putting the fun in funeral</h2> <p><em>The Last Revelation’</em>s ending deserved far more criticism.&nbsp;The game, during which you watched Lara Croft die some 40 billion times, ended with a cutscene in which Lara Croft died. A pyramid falls on top of her. “Reload then!” I remember saying to the screen at this ridiculous forced ending, reloading to see if I’d made a mistake. But nope, she was dead. It was extremely silly, but it happened for a reason. Core, the developers of the games, were sick of making <em>Tomb Raider&nbsp;</em>games. It was hoped that by killing her, the developers would be free to make something else. It didn’t work, and Eidos demanded more.</p>

 <p>However, it also set up a superb conceit for the fifth game,&nbsp;<em>Tomb Raider: Chronicles</em>. Rather than beginning with Lara in the middle of some improbable heist, then bringing us back to her manor to start a new series of international adventures, <em>Chronicles</em> began with Croft’s funeral. That’s something, right! And of course, everyone was expecting the immediate reveal, that having the Pyramid of Giza squish her flat turned out not to be so serious, and reports of her death were greatly exaggerated. Except that’s not what happened at all. Instead, post-funeral, Lara’s butler Wilson invites two of her close compatriots back to the manor for a drink. Together, the three begin to reminisce about their friend, recalling adventures that had yet to be seen in the games. And that’s what you play! Four stories, in completely unique settings, at different stages in Lara’s life—including as a teenager.</p>

 <p>The result was almost all great! Each of the four chapters was a distinct game, with enormous variety in setting, from haunted islands to modern, high-tech skyscrapers, via an abandoned submarine, delivering the intricate puzzles and acrobatic antics we’d come to expect from developers Core. That no one involved in the game apparently wanted to make it really didn’t come through, perhaps via some sort of involuntary competence, or as a result of breaking it into small chunks that felt less oppressive to create. I can imagine if someone had just played the first four games through in a row and then instantly started on this fifth, they could be thoroughly sick and tired of Lara and her formula. But giventhat&nbsp; a year went by between each entry, I really want to push back against this “fatigue” argument.</p>

 <figure id="attachment_2000646924" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000646924"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000646924">© Eidos / Mobygames</figcaption></figure> <h2>Backlashing out</h2> <p>No matter <em>Chronicles</em>‘ merits, they wouldn’t matter. The backlash was due, many critics were ready to put Lara in her place for having the temerity to keep returning. Scores came in hard and harsh, with even <em>IGN</em> almost hitting its lowest possible score of 6.&nbsp;<em>EDGE</em> dished out a mauling 4, while the usually supplicant&nbsp;<em>Official PlayStation Magazine</em> joined in with a 5. But as you read through those reviews (or the residual summaries remaining on the internet), they all praise the game, celebrate its great level design, recognize it as a good example of a&nbsp;<em>Tomb Raider</em> game, but then penalize it for…existing? <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20010220230712/http://www.zdnet.com/opm/stories/main/0,11891,2667614,00.html">That&nbsp;<em>OPM</em></a><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20010220230712/http://www.zdnet.com/opm/stories/main/0,11891,2667614,00.html"> review</a>, that 2.5 star score, described the game as “the best sequel in the series thus far,” albeit then claiming that all the other games “downright sucked.” The same magazine gave <em>TR II </em>a 9, then the third game 7. The fourth game, that one got a 10.</p> <p><a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2000/12/22/tomb-raider-chronicles"><em>IGN</em>‘s review</a> couldn’t make my argument any better. The 25-year-old article had the strapline, “Lara Croft’s last adventure on PlayStation is also her very best. Still, it’s just more of the same.” There it is! The whole point, perfectly encapsulated! How dare this game be the best example of a thing?</p> <p>The review goes on to say that the matter of annual releases “turned what could have been one of gaming’s most cherished franchises into one of the most reviled.” Most reviled! For the crime of carrying on being good too often. The article also praises the game for its four distinct chapters, offering “the greatest amount of diversity in play style and atmosphere,” then calls the fourth story “one of the best <em>Tomb Raider</em> levels ever.”</p>

 <p>A huge part of this reaction, as indeed is the case in most other examples, is leveling complaints at the latter entry that should have been raised from the start. So <em>Chronicles</em> was repeatedly berated across reviews for its control issues, and indeed the games’ silly combat, even though these aspects were almost always overlooked in the rush of excitement for, er, the first three games. The best example of the series so far, having the same faults as the poorer examples in the past, makes the most recent game the worst? That seems to be the rule.</p> <p>And yes, of course, I’m not naive. Having the same control issues five games in&nbsp;<em>is</em> crappy and should be dealt with. But given they were given a critical pass the first four times, and the games sold eighty million-billion-squillion copies despite them, there’s not a great deal of incentive being put before the developers to prioritize them. It is, in a large part, a failure of criticism.</p>

 <p>It’s the same reason Bethesda gets to release half-finished games with barely functioning UIs, because why would the developer bother to do otherwise? It knows it’ll get a round of 9s and 10s from every outlet despite it, and given the company releases new games every decade rather than every year, these consistent issues don’t seem to amount to “fatigue.” It took an actively&nbsp;<em>boring</em> game,&nbsp;<em>Starfield</em>, for any hint of that backlash to appear.</p> <figure id="attachment_2000646925" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000646925"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000646925">© Eidos / Mobygames</figcaption></figure> <h2>The fallen angel</h2> <p>I’m here to say that I loved&nbsp;<em>Tomb Raider: Chronicles</em>, despite the litany of flaws that haunted the entire franchise up until that point. I played&nbsp;<em>Tomb Raider</em> games on PC, with one hand on a game controller and the other on my keyboard, because this was the only way the crummy control issues were overcome. That worked for&nbsp;<em>Chronicles</em> as well as it worked for&nbsp;<em>Tomb Raider II</em>, and if anything, I was used to it by then. It was a splendid game, despite the malaise behind its creation, because—as so many identified at the time—it featured some of the best levels in the series!</p> <p>The irony that it was&nbsp;<em>Chronicles</em> that received the backlash when the borderline unplayable <em>Tomb Raider: The Angel of Darkness</em> was just three years away isn’t lost on me either. Both games were developed simultaneously, the former a reluctant sop to the publisher, the latter a whole fresh start for Core. But after years of delays and brutal development issues, <em>Angel of Darkness</em> was atrocious. Lara was close to uncontrollable, the enemy AI was abysmal, and the game quickly became a laughing stock. And it reviewed the same as <em>Chronicles</em>, because it was new! It was fresh! So it&nbsp;<em>had</em> to be interesting. This time, reviews went, “While the game is so broken as to be functionally useless, it has new graphics!” (To be abundantly fair to <em>IGN</em>, after just picking on them, <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2003/06/24/tomb-raider-the-angel-of-darkness">the site gave it a good kicking</a> with a score lower than some thought it could reach: 5.3.)</p>

 <p><em>Chronicles</em> is included in Aspyr’s recent remake, <a href="https://kotaku.com/tomb-raider-4-6-remastered-angel-darkness-release-date-1851670508"><em>Tomb Raider IV-VI Remastered</em></a>, although <a href="https://kotaku.com/tomb-raider-remastered-review-pc-lara-croft-1851250080">given my experience with the gruesome mess of the first three</a>, I’m not convinced it’d be the best way to play—definitely stick to the original graphics and controls. You can also <a href="https://www.gog.com/en/game/tomb_raider_the_last_revelation_chronicles">pick it up paired with&nbsp;<em>The Last Revelation</em> from GOG</a> for under $9, and then <a href="https://www.pcgamingwiki.com/wiki/Tomb_Raider_Chronicles">go crazy on&nbsp;<em>PCGamingWiki</em></a>, getting it all patched up for modern machines.</p> <p>I say it’s worth it! Ignore those fatigue-ridden naysayers. It’s OK for something to be good five times in a row.</p>

              <p>Amazon is practically giving away its smart plug at a price that barely exceeds what you’d pay for a basic outlet adapter: <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5877/">At $12, down from $24, this connected device costs roughly the same as a dumb power strip from the hardware store</a>.</p>
<p>This Black Friday, Amazon slashed prices across all its <strong>own-brand products by approximately 50%</strong>, selling at zero margin to drive ecosystem adoption. The smart plug exemplifies this aggressive strategy and offers voice control and automation at a price that removes every excuse for not starting your smart home journey.</p>

<h2>Voice Control That Changes Your Daily Routine</h2>
<p>The <strong>Alexa integration adds voice commands to any device</strong> that has a physical on/off switch. Tell Alexa to turn on your coffee maker from bed, and hot coffee waits when you reach the kitchen. Command the lamp in your living room to turn off from the couch. Turn on a fan in another room without walking there. These minor conveniences compound throughout your day into proper quality-of-life improvements.</p>
<p><strong>Setup takes literally minutes</strong> and requires no technical knowledge whatsoever. Plug the Smart Plug into any outlet, open the Alexa app on your phone, and follow the simple, on-screen prompts. The plug connects automatically to your 2.4GHz WiFi network. You then name the device based on what you’re controlling, such as “bedroom lamp” or “coffee maker.” It takes less than five minutes from box to working smart device.</p>



<p><strong>No smart home hub requirement</strong> removes the additional hardware cost that plagued earlier smart home adoptions. It directly connects your Smart Plug to your WiFi and communicates with Alexa over the cloud. You avoid buying expensive hubs like SmartThings or dedicated Zigbee coordinators. The Alexa app manages all your Smart Plugs from one interface.</p>
<p>Routine automation turns disparate smart devices into cohesive systems that react intelligently. Create a morning routine that starts the coffee maker at 7 AM, turns on bathroom lights, and starts playing the news on your Echo. A bedtime routine might turn off all the lights, smart lock the doors, and drop the thermostat. Leaving home triggers an away routine to power down everything non-essential. These are scheduled automations that happen independently of you and creates the smart home experience most people envision when they first hear about connected devices.</p>



<p><strong>Alexa+ capabilities give you much more natural interactions</strong> with your smart home. You can set routines without having to open the app, using voice commands for actions that power multiple devices at once, such as saying, “Alexa, it’s movie night,” to activate all the smart lighting in the room and turn on TV-connected devices. You can be a lot more casual about what you are asking for without needing to follow strict command structures. It all feels less robotic compared to earlier smart home controls, which required you to say things in a very specific way.</p>
<p>At $12, the smart plug provides fundamental smart home functionality at just about the price of basic electrical accessories this Black Friday. Want to start controlling devices by voice without spending hundreds on smart home infrastructure? This record-low price eliminates that barrier.</p>

              <p>Look up any portable video device — smartphone, tablet, or camera — and you’ll get a full, vivid description of just how good its video quality is. That does leave out one very important and all-too-often ignored part of a truly pro-quality recording — the sound. Even the best smartphones and pocket-sized action cams can leave you with truly spectacular video paired with tinny, shallow sound filled with background noise.</p>
<p>There’s no need for a boom mic — the DJI Mic Mini wireless lavalier microphone transmitter is the tiny, ultra-lightweight (10 grams) solution that delivers exceptional sound from as far away as 400 meters. Content creators, vloggers, and travel buffs can give their content a massive upgrade for a lowest-ever price during this <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5868/">Amazon Black Friday blowout that drops the price of the DJI Mic Mini by 45%, down to just $66.&nbsp;</a></p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5868/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Pro-Level Sound for Pro-Level Content</h2>
<p>As 4K or even higher-resolution video has moved from being the exclusive property of professional videographers to being a smartphone feature that you carry in your pocket, the world of content creation has exploded. But with ultra-hi-res videos and vlogs being created by virtually anyone and everyone, the best way to set yourself apart from the masses is with content that pairs that video with sound that’s just as good. DJI has mastered ultra-high-quality cameras, both in their tiny action cameras and their famous fleet of consumer drones. Once they turned their attention to sound, it was no surprise that the result was exceptionally small and lightweight, highly versatile, and of the best quality.</p>
<p>In barely a year’s time the Mic Mini has become the gold standard of rechargeable wireless microphones, with a stellar 4.7-star average rating at Amazon. It can be worn as a clip-on, on a lanyard, or magnetically attached to your clothes — regardless of how you decide to go, it’s unobtrusive on camera and able to deliver a highly stable, impeccable sound transmission from as far away as 400 meters, even in busy or noisy environments. Two built-in levels of noise cancellation — Basic for quiet indoor settings and Strong for noisy environments or outdoor shoots — cut out the background noise, often the biggest shortfall of video shot on a smartphone.</p>



<h2>The Total Package</h2>
<p>The sound quality of the DJI Mini Mic sets it apart from the built-in mics of any consumer-level video device — 48Hz sampling and 120 decibels of full, clear, rich sound. This Amazon deal includes everything you need to give your videos a huge sound boost – two transmitters and one receiver, a USB-C charging cable, four mini windscreens, a type-C smartphone adapter, two DJI Mic Mini Clip magnets, and a carrying pouch.</p>
<p>If you’re already shooting video with a DJI Osmo camera — the Pocket 3, Action 4, or Action 5 Pro, the Mini Mic can be used in a direct wireless connection to the camera, delivering premium audio without the need for a receiver. And a single charge gives you 48 hours of shoot time, so you never have to worry about going silent in the middle of a shoot.</p>
<p>For anyone who wants their videos to sound as good or even better than they look, this is the best $66 upgrade you can make. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5868/">It’s an amazing pre-Black Friday deal that’s live right now at Amazon — 45% off the price of the DJI Mic Mini.</a></p>

              <p>LEGO’s official website lists flagship sets at full retail price year-round with very little pricing variations. Amazon manages its own inventory and slashed the prices of thousands of products aggressively on Black Friday. Indeed, while <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4190/">LEGO still sells the Star Wars Millennium Falcon (25th anniversary) set for $84 on its website, Amazon slashes it to $67</a>. This <strong>921-piece collectible build</strong> of one of the most iconic starships in cinematic history is now at its lowest price ever.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4190/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Our Favorite Star Wars Set</h2>
<p>The 921-piece construction is satisfying to build and requires several sessions of focused building time. Each bag of parts opens up a new section of the Falcon, from the detailed cockpit to the iconic sensor dish. The process of building naturally encourages mindful relaxation as you work your way through the instructions, never hurrying the pace.</p>
<p>The <strong>mid-scale size</strong> hits the sweet spot between desktop models and massive display pieces: At 9.5 inches long, 7.5 inches wide, and 5 inches high, the finished Falcon commands attention without dominating an entire shelf. The proportions of this LEGO version hold true to the ship from A New Hope and do so in a structurally safe way. You can place this next to other mid-scale starships from the LEGO Star Wars collection with no mismatched sizes. The dimensions are perfect for home office desks, bedroom shelves, or living room displays.</p>



<p>Authentic details recreate the Falcon’s most recognizable features in LEGO brick form: The cockpit sits offset on the starboard side, just as it should. The quad laser cannons rotate and articulate for different display poses. The sensor dish mounts on top in its classic pre-Return of the Jedi configuration. The hull greebling makes use of clever part combinations to suggest the weathered, lived-in aesthetic of the original prop.</p>
<p>Thoughtful presentation features on the display stand take this set from toy to décor piece. Instead of placing flat on the table, the angled mounting provides dynamic visual interest. The nameplate clearly identifies the ship for guests who might not be too familiar with Star Wars. There is <strong>also a brick that commemorates 25 years of LEGO’s partnership with Star Wars</strong>. This stand design shows LEGO understands their adult audience, wanting display-worthy builds rather than play sets.</p>



<p><strong>4.9 out of 5 stars, with almost 2,000 reviews,</strong> confirms this set lives up to expectations. More than 10,000 sold in the last month prove sustained popularity well beyond a niche following among Star Wars fans. The wide appeal crosses multiple demographics: long-time fans of the franchise, LEGO collectors, décor-conscious adults, and gift-givers seeking a well-appreciated gift. The universal recognition of the Millennium Falcon transcends typical hobby boundaries.</p>
<p>At $67, the Star Wars Millennium Falcon set offers collectible quality 20% off retail this Black Friday. LEGO’s official site is still charging full price, while Amazon moves inventory aggressively.</p>
