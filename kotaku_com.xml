But it feels fitting that <em>Xenoblade Chronicles X</em>, a beloved but mostly overlooked game from 2015, will end up being part of the current console’s end-of-life send-off. <em>Xenoblade Chronicles X: Definitive Edition</em> arrives on March 20, 2025, with enhanced visuals and new story beats. </p><p>Here’s the trailer:</p><p><em>Xenoblade Chronicles X</em> is a futuristic game about trying to rebuild humanity on a distant and hostile planet called Mira. The large-scale world is full of giant monsters to fight, mechs to customize and ride, and lots of MMO-style fetch quests and resource harvesting. There’s also multiplayer-specific missions and Global Nemesis Battles in addition to all of the existing character affinities and skill trees to manage. </p><p>It’s Monolith Soft’s immediate follow-up to <em>Xenoblade Chronicles</em> for the Wii, and had a bit more of the mech-infused flavor of studio cofounder Tetsuya Takahashi’s previous RPG series,<em> Xenogears </em>and<em> Xenosaga</em>. It’s also precisely the sort of game that would benefit from some Definitive Edition cleanup, and possibly even the added horsepower of a Switch 2 whenever it finally arrives. </p><p>In the meantime, it’s exciting to see the entire <em>Xenoblade</em> series up to this point in one place. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/xenoblade-chronicles-3-nintendo-switch-jrpg-impressions-1849357306&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/xenoblade-chronicles-3-nintendo-switch-jrpg-impressions-1849357306"><em>Xenoblade Chronicles 3</em></a></span> and its beefy expansion were excellent, and while I can’t wait to see what Monolith Soft does next, an upgrade port of <em>Xenoblade Chronicles X </em>is the perfect thing to tide fans over unit its next project is officially announced. </p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

The supporting actor in <em>Anchorman</em> and <em>Arrested Development</em> was one of many people spotted and identified at the attack, thanks to pictures shared on social media. </p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="197298" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="Live Forever in the Universe of 'New World: Aeternum'" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="108" data-playlist="197298,197284,197260" data-current="197298"><div><p>Live Forever in the Universe of 'New World: Aeternum'</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197298/197298_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197298/197298_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197298/197298_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197298/197298_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"></video></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p><em>Bob’s Burgers</em> is a show about a struggling burger joint and the family who runs it, and Jimmy Pesto is Bob’s main antagonist and an all-around asshole. So it’s always been incredibly ironic that the actor who played him was caught partaking in one of the more violent and shameful moments in American history. If there were a January 6 riot inside the universe of Bob’s Burgers, you know Jimmy Pesto would have been in the thick of it as well. </p><p>This week’s sentencing falls short of the 18 months requested by federal prosecutors, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/justice-department/comedian-anchorman-mr-show-sentenced-jan-6-capitol-attack-rcna177642&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/justice-department/comedian-anchorman-mr-show-sentenced-jan-6-capitol-attack-rcna177642" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">NBC News reports</a></span>, but is still well above what Johnston’s lawyers were seeking. The sentencing memo claims the Hollywood actor was far from just a bystander at the riot and was instead inside Congress pushing forward with the rest of the mob, at one point wielding a riot shield against police in the tunnels beneath the building. Johnston’s lawyer, meanwhile, claimed he was being disproportionally targeted due to his fame. </p><p>Despite the attack on the Capitol taking place in January 2021, the actor wasn’t arrested until June 2023, after which he pled guilty. Federal prosecutors also shared a photo as part of sentencing that showed Johnston dressing up as QAnon Shaman more than a year after the riots. </p><p><em>Bob’s Burgers</em> didn’t replace Johnston until late 2023, after he had already been arrested, with the character being left out of seasons 12 and 13. Jimmy Pesto is now played by Eric Bauza, who debuted in season 14 and had previously done voice work for cartoon characters like Bugs Bunny and Daffy Duck. <em>Bob’s Burgers </em>just entered its 15th season last month. </p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
