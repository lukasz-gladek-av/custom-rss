              <p>It’s pretty sad to see&nbsp;<a href="https://kotaku.com/metroid-prime-4-beyond-kotaku-review-is-it-good-120-fps-switch-2-2000651400"><em>Metroid Prime 4: Beyond</em></a> already fading away just a couple of weeks on from its release. Slipping out of the charts already and failing to make much of an impact after an 18-year wait, it feels like something of a death knell for Samus’ 3D adventures. But if there’s any way to take my mind off the ennui this elicits, it’s to remember the NPCs talking at me while I was trying to play, and then perhaps be a bit glad. Although it could have been a lot worse: Astonishingly, <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/you-want-me-to-build-rocket-skates-fans-uncover-30-mins-of-cut-metroid-prime-4-dialogue/">as <em>VGC</em> reports</a>, players have now discovered another 30 minutes of dialogue for its NPCs that was mercifully cut from the final game.</p> <p>Universally recognized as the game’s worst choice, the fourth installment in the splendid <em>Metroid Prime</em> franchise has incessant nattering from a range of NPCs, who seem to be there simply to irritate Samus as she tries to get on with her exploring, shooting, and scanning. Samus’ wordless responses start to feel like the most remarkable act of passive-aggression as her gabby companions refuse to take the hint. And it’s so incongruous! It’s incongruous to the entire <em>Metroid</em> franchise, given the usually solitary nature of the suited heroine, and it’s incongruous to&nbsp;<em>this game</em>, given its post-colony setting of ruins. Leave her be!</p>

 <p>So it really beggars belief that there was once an intention for there to be even more. YouTuber Bearborg, who will hopefully end up with more than 24 subscribers by the end of today, has uploaded all the conversations coming from the base camp during the game, which in the released version are mercifully limited to about seven-and-a-half minutes. There then follows a further 33 minutes of talking that was cut from the game, containing a whole lot of banality that’s supposed to be (scarequotes) “banter.”</p>  <p>The dialogue that’s been unearthed isn’t polished, with occasional moments of an old-school text-to-speech voice among the actors. All the performances are completely fine, and it was clearly intended to be background color when written and recorded, not plot-critical content. Thank goodness someone at some point realized this isn’t the right game for it. Were these comments optional extras in an RPG, or conversations from which you could walk away in an open-world, it would be harmless stuff. But the enforced nature of it all in <em>Metroid Prime 4</em>, amidst a series of games best enjoyed for their peace and quiet, remains such a weird choice.</p>

              <p>Still got a few people lift on your gift shopping list unaccounted for? I get it. Some folks are easy to shop for, others aren’t. Lots of folks you’ve got a million ideas to choose from, but sometimes for Secret Santa, you might draw a name of someone who isn’t all that outspoken about what they like. That’s when you got with ol’ reliable—a Bluetooth speaker. Everyone under the sun can enjoy a Bluetooth speaker, and even if they already have one, it doesn’t hurt to have two. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6422/">Amazon has the Beats Pill portable speaker on sale for 33% off at the moment.

All three color options are part of Amazon’s 33% sale so you can pick based on taste, not price.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Google Goes Final Clearance on Pixel Buds Pro 2, AirPods and Galaxy Buds Can’t Compete at This Price]]></title>
            <link>https://kotaku.com/google-goes-final-clearance-on-pixel-buds-pro-2-airpods-and-galaxy-buds-cant-compete-at-this-price-2000653813</link>
            <guid>1384729</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>The second-generation Pixel Buds Pro were released last year in September. These minimal ANC buds retail for $229, but we just found a way to grab them for under $200.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6032/">Amazon just dropped the pair by 26%, bringing the overall price down to just $169.</a> You’re not just saving a nice $60 on your purchase, but also getting free delivery, as well as a two-month free trial of Audible with the order. This $169 price also matches what we saw during Black Friday, so if you missed grabbing the pair during the main event, now is a great time to pick them up. Additionally, all color options are discounted, so you’ve got quite a few options to choose from. However, note that only the earbuds change color; the charging case remains white.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6032/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Solid ANC Capabilities</h2>
<p>Google calls these the most comfortable earbuds ever – and we don’t doubt that. These small, round buds fit nicely for all-day use, plus come with a twist-to-adjust stabilizer for an even more secure fit. The latter is great for workouts, especially when things get a bit intense, such as during cardio or boxing. You won’t have to worry about them slipping out every few minutes.</p>
<p>The Tensor A1 chip delivers premium sound for all your tracks, whether you’re listening to something bass-heavy or a theme song that’s a bit on the calmer side. Vocals, with every beat, come through clearly, like never before. Active Noise Cancellation is the highlight here, though. This mode uses Silent Seal 2.0 to block all unwanted background noise for a more immersive sound experience. ANC comes in handy when you really need to focus on a task in a chaotic setting, or just want to zone out with your favorite song for a bit. Of course, that doesn’t work for every situation. For when you do need to stay aware of what’s happening around you, there’s a Transparency Mode you can switch to. This mode lets some sound in, while still letting you enjoy quality audio. There’s a conversation detection feature, too. It pauses your music and automatically switches the earbuds to Transparency mode when you speak.</p>



<p>Calls get better, as well. That’s thanks to a combination of beamforming mics, wind-blocking mesh covers, and AI assistance. These come together to deliver your voice on the other end clearly, even when you’re travelling or sitting in a busy cafe. Speaking of on-the-go usage, the Buds Pro 2 are IPX4 water-resistant, so rain or a few water splashes by the pool won’t hurt.</p>
<p>Battery life is another strong selling point. A single charge gets you up to 30 hours of listening with ANC on. Transparency mode consumes less battery, so you can extend the overall listening time by mixing both.</p>
<p>All things considered, if you’ve been looking for a way to upgrade to the Google Pixel Buds Pro 2, now is a great time to make the move. These offer two listening modes, transparency and ANC. The sound quality is exceptional, and the built-in microphones make it easy to hop on calls, even in noisy settings. You’ll also appreciate the long battery life, which offers extra peace of mind during long commutes and off-road adventures. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6032/">The current deal brings the price down to $169, making the upgrade much more affordable.</a> If you like the offer, consider grabbing these quickly, before the price goes back up.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>You don’t have to sacrifice your entire workspace just to fit a traditional tower PC on your desk. If space matters to you, switching to a compact yet capable mini PC can make a huge difference. The ACEMAGIC Mini PC is designed for students, professionals, and everyday users who want strong performance without clutter.<a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6421/"> It is currently available at a deep discount on Amazon in which you can save as much as $240 for a limited time.</a></p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6421/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Big Performance in a Small Footprint</h2>
<p>Despite its ultra-compact design, the ACEMAGIC Mini PC delivers impressive power. Inside this tiny chassis, there are a couple options for memory and storage. The cheapest option—housing 16GB of RAM and 512GB of storage—normally runs for $459, but is right now down 28% to just $329. You can choose to upgrade to 32GB of RAM and 1TB of storage. That one is normally $499, but has come down to just $429 (14% discount). Both these options come with an AMD Ryzen 7 6800H processor with integrated graphics, though you can bump up to the upgraded AMD Ryzen 7 8745HS processor for just $519 total. That’s down by 32% from $759 (also comes with 32GB of RAM and 1TB of storage).</p>
<p>If you find you don’t have enough space for your needs, storage is expandable up to 4TB with an additional compatible SSD.</p>
<p>This hardware combination is well suited for everyday computing tasks such as web browsing, office work, creative projects, and even light gaming. Multitasking feels smooth thanks to the included 32GB of memory, which helps applications run quickly and efficiently. The system comes preloaded with Windows 11 Pro, allowing you to get started immediately without dealing with complicated setup steps or extra software installations.</p>



<p>For display capabilities, the mini PC supports impressive visuals. Using its USB4 Type-C or DisplayPort 2.0 output, it can deliver up to 8K resolution at 60Hz. There is also an HDMI slot available which is capable of up to 4K at 60Hz. All together, these enable you to connect three monitors at the same time for increased productivity or multitasking.</p>
<p>The ACEMAGIC Mini PC includes built-in Wi-Fi and Bluetooth 4.2, ensuring stable internet access and easy pairing with accessories like keyboards, mice, and headphones. You’ll also find two USB 3.2 ports on the front with four more on the back for even more peripheral options.</p>
<p>Thermal management has not been overlooked either. Dual centrifual fans and a stacked fin array design help keep internal temperatures under control. The independent aluminum SSD heatsink can disperse heat quietly, allowing you to maintain stable read and write speeds during extended use.</p>
<p>If you need a full-featured computer that takes up minimal space, the ACEMAGIC Mini PC is a compelling option. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6421/">With its current discount of up to 32%, the price of the highest tier model drops to just $519 for a limited time.</a> For anyone upgrading, downsizing, or building a clean, efficient workstation at home or the office, this mini PC may be just what you’re looking for.</p>
