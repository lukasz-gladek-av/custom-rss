As you play this open-world racing adventure, you’ll unlock a smorgasbord of cosmetics you can equip, giving you plenty of reasons to update your character’s look throughout the game. </p><p>Unfortunately, you can’t customize your character just anywhere in <em>Forza Horizon 5</em>. Instead, you’ll need to head to specific places on the map that grant you access to this menu option. Here’s where to go to make it happen.</p><p>There are two places you can customize your character in <em>Forza Horizon 5</em>: The Horizon Festival and player houses.</p><p>The Horizon Festival is unlocked almost immediately, while player houses are spread across the map and must be purchased over time. However, <strong>your first player house, known as Casa Bella, can be obtained for free early in the game after unlocking the first Adventure Chapter. </strong></p><p>It doesn’t matter whether you choose the Horizon Festival or a player house for character customization, as the options are identical at both. So, just choose whichever you’d prefer (probably the closest one) when you’d like to customize your character at one of these spots. You can drive or fast travel to the location, then choose to enter it. </p><p>Once you’ve reached and entered the appropriate location, scroll to the “My Festival” tab and select “Customize Character”. Now <strong>you can change your character’s gender, identity, and voice, as well as equip them with any of the clothing items or full outfits you’ve unlocked</strong>. Some cosmetics are locked behind progression or wheel spins, while others can be purchased using credits. But the best option is clearly the chicken suit, so who cares about the rest, right?</p><hr><p><em>Forza Horizon 5</em> is available on PS5, Xbox Series X/S, and Windows PCs.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

With a bevy of cars to find and drive, an absolutely killer soundtrack, and an endlessly replayable online component, there’s no shortage of fun to be had in this exciting entry in the beloved racing franchise. But if you’re curious about the game’s overall length as a PlayStation gamer, here’s how long it takes to beat <em>Forza Horizon 5</em>.</p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="195371" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="Long-Lost Halo Demo Comes To Life" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="109" data-playlist="195371,195840,196163" data-current="195371"><div><p>Long-Lost Halo Demo Comes To Life</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195371/195371_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195371/195371_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195371/195371_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195371/195371_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/20829.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><h2 id="h982"><a id=""></a>How long will it take you to finish <em>Forza Horizon 5</em>?</h2><p>There are so many things vying for your attention between <em>Forza Horizon 5</em>'s main races that it’s hard to say exactly how long it’ll take each person to beat the base campaign. But <strong>if you’re just looking to mainline the core experience, expect to spend about 20 hours</strong> <strong>doing so</strong>.</p><p>There’s simply so much to do in <em>Forza Horizon 5</em>, though, that <strong>dedicated players can easily squeeze 50-100 hours out of the game</strong> finding every car, completing all side races and stories, and smashing through every billboard. </p><p>Trophy and achievement hunters might stretch things even further in their effort to max out the game, as they’ll have to engage in some additional tasks that aren’t necessary for in-game completion, such as taking unique pictures, winning online races, and more.</p><p>Of course, if you’re looking for even more adventures through Mexico, <strong>you can score another combined 20-30 hours of fun out of the game’s <em>Rally Adventure</em> and <em>Hot Wheels</em> expansions</strong>. They’ll need to be purchased separately or as part of the Premium Edition of the game. But given the size and scope of them, they’re certainly worthwhile add-ons for racing enthusiasts.</p><p>And it goes without saying that the online component of <em>Forza Horizon 5</em> ensures that social gamers can continue enjoying the game well after they’ve crossed everything off the map. If you ever see my Drivatar driving around out there, though, please don’t make fun of me. I know I suck.

I gave them plenty of chances.</p><p><em>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</em> endlessly defies what you expect it to be about. Sandfall Interactive’s favorite thing, other than making you sad with one of the most gut-wrenching RPG premises it could concoct, is twisting the knife and showing you nothing is as you believed. The game starts with the titular expedition group journeying beyond their island home in Lumière to defeat a god-like entity called the Paintress. Every year, she paints a number on a monolith visible from the island, and anyone of that age is “gommaged” from the world, disappearing in a cloud of petals. The knowledge that lives have a guaranteed expiration date has shaped the culture of this world. When people approach their final year, they join an expedition to hopefully stop the Paintress, or at least lay down the foundation for the next expedition to succeed. This has been going on for decades, and time is running out for the citizens of Lumière as the Paintress etches a “33” on the monolith. That’s where <em>Clair Obscur </em>starts, but I couldn’t have anticipated where it would end.</p><p>All three of <em>Clair Obscur</em>’s acts are punctuated with a game-shifting turn. At the end of the first act, Gustave, the grieving swordsman and gunslinger protagonist, is killed in cold blood. An incomprehensively old man named Renoir, who has somehow survived in a world where the life expectancy dwindles each year, is protecting the Paintress, and to do that, he kills your main character! The reins of this expedition are then handed to Verso, a man who is revealed to be the son of Renoir.. But this family drama goes far beyond a son trying to stop his father from killing expeditioners, and the consequences of this shift the entire world of <em>Clair Obscur </em>on its axis.</p><figure id="" data-id="2fedee88c865b45d2497d683e30fdce5" data-recommend-id="image://2fedee88c865b45d2497d683e30fdce5" data-format="jpg" data-width="3839" data-height="1599" data-lightbox="true" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Sandfall Interactive / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="2fedee88c865b45d2497d683e30fdce5" data-recommend-id="image://2fedee88c865b45d2497d683e30fdce5" data-format="jpg" data-width="3839" data-height="1599" data-lightbox="true" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Ever more layers to this universe are revealed, and by the end of Act II, the scope widens to show you just how much bigger this tale is than the opening gambit of an expedition to stop the Paintress. It turns out the Paintress isn’t quite a god, but a woman who uses her family’s magic to “paint” worlds onto canvases that can bring whatever’s painted on them to life. She, her husband, and her children all wield this power and have created and explored different worlds inside these canvases throughout their lifetimes. This world, the one the expedition is trying to save, is the lone creation of the Paintress’ son, who died in a fire that left his sister scarred and the family broken. This world is all she has left of her son, and her unrelenting need to preserve it is consuming her.</p><p>Meanwhile, her husband (the real Renoir, on whom the fictional man who has been killing expeditioners is based) is trying to destroy this canvas so his family can try to move on. He wants his wife to be set free from this magical world of their son’s imagination, in which she is losing herself. The numbers the Paintress brushes on the monolith aren’t a signifier of the people she’s Thanos-snapping out of existence, but a warning that her power to defend the general populace is waning, and that as she loses her strength in this decades-long battle with her husband to preserve her son’s memory, the eldest among them will be the next to disappear.</p><p>This twist has been <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.polygon.com/review/563522/clair-obscur-expedition-33-review-ps5-pc-xbox&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.polygon.com/review/563522/clair-obscur-expedition-33-review-ps5-pc-xbox" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">understandably divisive</a></span>. Any time a story presents itself as one thing and reveals itself to be something else entirely, you run the risk of losing people brought in by the initial premise. However, I’m glad to report that at this point, I was more on board than ever. I’d already been locked in by <em>Clair Obscur</em>’s meditations on grieving a life you know you’ll never get to live. Grief is a cultural touchstone of this universe, and to find that it was all born of a mother’s loss of her child was an incredible new lens through which to view it. It’s revealed that all of this loss was not inevitable, and that the expedition’s fictional nature means that if they defeat Renoir and put an end to his gommage, they could potentially bring back everyone they lost. This adds new layers of nuance about how we keep someone’s memory alive when they’re gone, and how a creative work, even if it’s mostly a child’s fantasy, is one way to remember those we’ve lost. But again, this is <em>Clair Obscur</em>, and it always has another devastating trick up its sleeve.</p><p>The game’s final act lets you head right for the point of no return, to face Renoir, loosen his grip on this world, and bring back all the people he has gommaged over the past 67 years. By this point, you’ve learned that Verso is the fictional facsimile of the Paintress’ dead son. You’ve also found out that another of your party members, Maelle, is the Paintress’ real-life daughter, who entered the painting to find her missing parents, and instead found a new life in which she’s no longer debilitated by the damage from the fire. Verso now wants to tear down the canvas, so he can stop living as a puppet propping up his family’s memory of a son and brother long gone. However, Maelle wants to bring everyone back and live out her life in her brother’s creation. So it’s up to you, the player, to choose who to play as in one final battle and determine the fate of Verso’s canvas.</p><figure id="" data-id="4234e4cc7fef370f76ed405d0d32872d" data-recommend-id="image://4234e4cc7fef370f76ed405d0d32872d" data-format="jpg" data-width="3836" data-height="1599" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Maelle and Verso face each other in front of a distorted painting." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Maelle and Verso face each other in front of a distorted painting." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Sandfall Interactive / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="4234e4cc7fef370f76ed405d0d32872d" data-recommend-id="image://4234e4cc7fef370f76ed405d0d32872d" data-format="jpg" data-width="3836" data-height="1599" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Maelle and Verso face each other in front of a distorted painting." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>This was a decision so agonizing I had to put down my controller and make food, so I could give it proper thought. I was swayed to Verso’s side, until I returned and picked up the controller, when somehow my instincts took over, and I played as Maelle. Only, the ending I picked wasn’t quite what I envisioned. Rather than a bittersweet moment of Maelle bringing back all her brother’s creations and living happily ever after, what I experienced was more of a horror story. In this scenario, Maelle had trapped Verso in this world, forcing him to play piano for her and the rest of the revived Lumière.</p><p>I hadn’t perceived the game as setting up Maelle’s wishes to be a selfish path. I’d bought into the idea that saving the canvas and Verso’s memory was a noble choice worthy of the themes <em>Clair Obscur </em>had been operating within. But maybe that was me getting swept away by an idealistic view of this entire conflict. One of the only things that’s just as embedded in <em>Clair Obscur</em>’s DNA as grief is misdirection.</p><p>It’s been a few days since I finished <em>Clair Obscur</em>. I’ve been talking with others who have finished the game, and we’re all wrestling with the same questions of whether or not Sandfall Interactive truly stuck the landing. There are throughlines of grief in every new path it takes, but as the game shifts its themes, what it has to say about the process, the good and bad ways we deal with grief, and who was actually “right” in the surprising metatexual conflict, seems to shift as quickly as its inconsistent dodging windows. I’ve chewed on every possibility for days now, and part of me wonders if that dissatisfaction is just part of the process.</p><figure id="" data-id="2ac0c160fdec88b332781dedad592424" data-recommend-id="image://2ac0c160fdec88b332781dedad592424" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Maelle with distortion across her face." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Maelle with distortion across her face." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Sandfall Interactive / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="2ac0c160fdec88b332781dedad592424" data-recommend-id="image://2ac0c160fdec88b332781dedad592424" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Maelle with distortion across her face." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Maybe I’m grieving the happy ending I thought I was fighting for. Perhaps, after all the death and despair I saw in <em>Clair Obscur</em>, it was foolish to have been looking for one in the first place. Grief isn’t just mourning the loss of a person, it’s lamenting a life you imagined you’d have. Sometimes I wonder if coming out of the grieving process is in fact delusion. We have to explain to ourselves how something as senseless as death has meaning, or reassure one another that we’ll see those we’ve lost in whatever comes next. We tell ourselves whatever is necessary in order to feel somewhat okay again, even if it doesn’t quite make sense. But no matter how we bandage the wound, grief never entirely goes away. We just come up with whatever explanation helps us go on about our day. I feel like that’s where I’m at with <em>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</em>. I’ve decided that its ending, my dissatisfaction with parts of it, and all the ways the conclusion subverted what I hoped for, was probably the point. I can stay in the denial phase a little bit longer.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

And that’s cool, but it also has me wondering what it means for <em>Grand Theft Auto 6.</em></p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="196653" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="The Week In Games: A Star Wars Classic Returns &amp; More New Releases" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="105" data-playlist="196653,195371,195386" data-current="196653"><div><p>The Week In Games: A Star Wars Classic Returns &amp; More New Releases</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196653/196653_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196653/196653_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196653/196653_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196653/196653_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/22209.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>On April 29, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://bsky.app/profile/wario64.bsky.social/post/3lnxicudw3e2c&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://bsky.app/profile/wario64.bsky.social/post/3lnxicudw3e2c" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Pitchford shared a video on social media</a></span> about <em>Borderlands 4.</em> He started the video off hinting that he had some bad news to share about the upcoming shooter, though this turned out to be a ruse as he soon pivoted to confirm that development on the game was going great. As a result, Pitchford announced in the cellphone video that instead of <em>Borderlands 4</em> coming out near the end of September, it was now launching on September 12, 11 days earlier than first announced. </p><p>Pitchford then promptly deleted the video off of Twitter, and <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://x.com/DuvalMagic/status/1917221818982690865&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://x.com/DuvalMagic/status/1917221818982690865" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">followed it up with a tweet</a></span> implying that he shouldn’t have posted that announcement until later in the day. “Oops - time zones… Reposting momentarily :) .” <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://x.com/Borderlands/status/1917232692607021311&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://x.com/Borderlands/status/1917232692607021311" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The news has since been announced officially via the<em> Borderlands</em> account.</a></span> </p><p>“The team has been working very hard and everything is going great actually,” said Pitchford in the video. “In fact, everything is kinda going the best-case-scenario. The game is awesome. The team is cooking. And so, the launch date for <em>Borderlands 4 </em>is changing. We’re moving it forward....Holy, holy, what?! This never happens, you guys, this never happens.”</p><p>Announced back in the summer of2024, <em>Borderlands 4</em> is the next main installment in the super-popular looter shooter series from Gearbox and 2K. The upcoming FPS got its original September 23 launch date back in February. <em>Borderlands 4</em> is being developed for PC, Switch 2, PS5, and Xbox Series X/S. </p><p>Players will get a chance to see more of <em>Borderlands 4</em> <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://blog.playstation.com/2025/04/29/watch-the-borderlands-4-gameplay-deep-dive-state-of-play-on-april-30/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/04/29/watch-the-borderlands-4-gameplay-deep-dive-state-of-play-on-april-30/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">during an upcoming Sony State of Play on April 30</a></span> that will be about 20 minutes long and feature a deep dive into the shooter’s gameplay and world. </p><h2 id="h164646"><a id=""></a>What does this mean for <em>GTA 6</em>'s release date? </h2><p>While this is exciting news for <em>Borderlands </em>fans, <em>Grand Theft Auto</em> fans waiting for <em>GTA 6 </em>are likely paying close attention as well. <em>Borderlands 4</em> was one of the first big AAA video games of the year to nail down a fall release date despite<em> GTA 6</em> not yet having an official launch date. And because both games are published by companies owned by Take-Two Interactive (Rockstar Games and 2K), that meant a lot of people (myself included) <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/gta-6-release-october-borderlands-4-take-two-rockstar-1851764006&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/gta-6-release-october-borderlands-4-take-two-rockstar-1851764006">speculated that the original late September release was picked to avoid <em>GTA 6</em>'s rumored October launch</a></span> as much as possible while still giving Gearbox plenty of runway to finish their game. </p><p>Now that <em>Borderlands 4</em> is launching <em>earlier</em>, what does that mean for <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.gamefile.news/p/dice-cards-ruler-earthbound-vivrato&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.gamefile.news/p/dice-cards-ruler-earthbound-vivrato" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>GTA 6</em></a></span>? It’s possible that it means nothing. It could be that <em>GTA 6</em>'s internal date is still the same and Gearbox is just shipping its game a bit earlier because its development is going so smoothly that they can afford to do that. It’s also possible <em>GTA 6</em>'s release date has moved up and that has forced Take-Two to push other games up, too, in order to avoid <em>GTA 6</em>. </p><p>I’ll be curious to see if <em>Mafia: The Old Country</em>, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://insider-gaming.com/mafia-old-country-release-date-revealed-steam/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://insider-gaming.com/mafia-old-country-release-date-revealed-steam/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">set to launch in late August</a></span>, stays there or if it also gets moved up. Or potentially even gets delayed until after <em>GTA 6, </em>though that seems like it would be a death sentence for <em>Mafia</em>, as it’s likely to be, similar to past entries, a crime-focused open-world action game directly competing with <em>GTA 6</em>. In any case, things are getting interesting.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
