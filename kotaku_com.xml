              <p>Floor cleaning splits into two separate tasks that waste time and leave you switching between vacuuming and mopping with different equipment. Tineco dominates the wet dry vacuum category by eliminating this inefficiency, and competitors haven’t caught up to their smart sensor technology that adjusts cleaning parameters automatically based on mess detection. The<strong> Floor One S5</strong> handles everything from dry debris to sticky spills in a single pass without manual mode switching or guesswork about water flow rates. Amazon<a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5768/"> just dropped this machine to a record low of $259 for Black Friday, down from its usual $449 price</a>, which makes this pro floor cleaning accessible at nearly half the typical cost.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5768/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Transforms Cleaning Intelligence</h2>
<p>Proprietary <em>iLoop</em> technology <strong>detects the level of mess and automatically adjusts suction power, water flow volume, and brush roller speed</strong> in real-time to match what it encounters. Heavy dirt automatically turns up the suction and quickens the brush speeds; light dust reduces power consumption to prolong battery life. The sticky messes get more water flow to dissolve the residue, while the dry ones get less to avoid over-wetting</p>
<p>The dual-tank system keeps the <strong>cleaning solution and dirty water completely separate throughout the process</strong>. Fresh water and cleaning solution flow from the clean tank to the brush roller, while contaminated water gets sucked into the separate dirty tank. This design ensures you’re always cleaning with fresh water rather than spreading dirty water around, like most mop and bucket systems do. The clean water tank increased 30% in capacity compared to previous generations, allowing it to cover larger areas before requiring refills.</p>



<p>The design of the brush roller places the bristles close to baseboards and into corners where dirt accumulates, but standard vacuum heads cannot reach. The edge-to-edge coverage of the roller eliminates the gap that requires you to go back with hand tools or separate edge cleaners. Floors are completely dry within minutes after cleaning, rather than remaining damp for hours like traditional mopping leaves them.</p>



<p>The <strong>hands-free self-cleaning cycle</strong> takes care of the most dreaded maintenance task with traditional mops. Press one button, and the machine automatically flushes the internal tubing and brush roller with clean water, which dislodges trapped hair, debris, and dirty water from the cleaning system. After the cleaning cycle is complete, the centrifugal drying function spins excess water out of the roller to prevent mildew growth and odors that build up in damp cleaning tools. This automated maintenance takes mere minutes with zero manual scrubbing or touching of the dirty roller.</p>
<p>The <strong>3-in-1 docking station combines storage, charging, and self-cleaning in one small footprint</strong>. The vertical storage design saves valuable floor space over maintaining a separate vacuum and mop with their accessories and cleaning supplies. The station charges the battery between uses and is the anchor for the self-cleaning cycle. The cordless design reaches all areas of your home without being tethered by extension cords limiting your range or presenting tripping hazards while cleaning.</p>
<p>The machine deals with hard floor types like tile, hardwood, laminate and vinyl without any specific attachments or changing settings. From sticky kitchen spills and bathroom grime to muddy footprints and pet accidents, all clean up with the same equipment and technique. The cleaning solution works on multiple floor types without residue or requiring specific formulations for different surfaces. Regular maintenance involves cleaning the filter and the HEPA element monthly to maintain suction performance and wiping the dirty water tank sensor to avoid false full alerts.</p>
<p>At $259, you’re getting Tineco’s flagship wet/dry vacuum technology for $190 below standard retail pricing that puts this category out of reach for many households. The 42% discount brings automated floor cleaning within budget for people tired of the vacuum-then-mop routine that doubles cleaning time.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/skip-gopro-this-insta360-8k-360-action-camera-drops-to-new-record-low-on-amazon-2000645958</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/skip-gopro-this-insta360-8k-360%C2%B0-action-camera-drops-to-new-record-low-on-amazon.1360294/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Action cameras used to be a choice between GoPro’s standard rectangular frame or settling for cheaper alternatives with questionable quality. Insta360 has emerged as a heavyweight competitor that delivers capabilities GoPro can’t match, specifically the ability to capture everything around you simultaneously in 8K resolution. The <strong>X5 records full 360-degree video</strong> that lets you choose angles during editing rather than committing to a single perspective while filming. Amazon<a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5767/"> just dropped this camera to a record low of $464 for Black Friday, down from its usual $549 price</a>, and this aggressive pricing puts serious pressure on GoPro’s market dominance.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5767/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>8K 360-Degree Capture Eliminates Missed Moments</h2>
<p>It boasts <strong>dual 1/1.28-inch sensors to capture 8K footage at 30 frames per second</strong>, recording everything in your line of sight with really impressive detail and dynamic range. This omnidirectional recording means you’ll never miss the action happening behind you or to the side while focused on something else. The bigger sensor size relative to most action cameras pulls in more light and offers more excellent color accuracy across a wide range of lighting conditions. You can pull any angle from standard flat video after filming, which effectively gives you infinite camera positions from one recording session.</p>
<p>The t<strong>riple AI chip architecture will process the enormous streams of data from both sensors</strong> and at the same time applying sophisticated noise reduction algorithms. This computing power results in usable footage in low-light conditions where conventional action cameras produce a grainy, unuseable result. Night skiing, evening events, or indoor activities become viable shooting scenarios rather than situations in which you pack the camera away.</p>



<p>The invisible selfie stick effect creates impossible-seeming third-person perspectives that follow you through scenes. The camera’s software automatically removes the selfie stick from the 360-degree footage and make shots appear as if filmed by a drone or cameraman tracking alongside. This cinematic effect works because the stick occupies such a narrow slice of the<strong> full 360-degree field of view that the AI can seamlessly stitch around it</strong>. You get professional-looking tracking shots without carrying gimbal equipment or recruiting someone to film you.</p>
<p><em>InstaFrame Mode</em> automatically generates a ready-to-share flat video without requiring a full 360-degree editing workflow. The camera can auto-track your movement, keeping you centered in the frame as you move around, or lock to a fixed angle for static compositions. It lets you do this far quicker when all you want is quick social media content rather than elaborate 360 experiences.</p>



<p><em>FlowState</em> stabilization and 360-degree <em>Horizon Lock</em> eliminate the need for additional weight and complexity due to gimbal equipment. Advanced stabilization algorithms work to smooth out bumps, vibrations, and sudden movements that would make traditional footage unwatchable. The horizon lock keeps framing level even during complete rotations or dramatic angle changes. Mountain biking, skiing, skateboarding, and other high-impact activities result in smooth, professional-looking footage without the floating camera effect that electronic stabilization sometimes produces.</p>
<p>The replaceable lens design addresses the biggest weakness of previous 360 cameras where damaged lenses necessitated the replacement of the entire expensive unit. Similarly, the upgraded lenses in this device are more resistant to scratches and impacts compared to their predecessors, but when an accident occurs, you can swap them out in seconds. Such repairability significantly extends the camera’s useful life because lens damage becomes a minor maintenance issue rather than a catastrophic failure.</p>
<p>This four-microphone array features advanced Wind Guard technology, capturing clearer audio when engaged in outdoor activities. Where normally wind noise drowns out voices, this system focuses on vocal frequencies while filtering out the wind interference that often ruins audio in traditional action camera recordings. This matters for vlogging, narration, or any scenario in which you’re talking while filming.</p>
<p>Waterproof construction to 49 feet operates without separate housing that adds bulk and degrades image quality. You can take the X5 swimming, surfing, or diving in shallow water without protective cases. The <strong>battery life of 185 minutes</strong> covers extended shooting sessions or full-day adventures, while fast charging reaches 80 percent capacity in just 20 minutes.</p>
<p>You’re getting cutting-edge 360-degree technology at $85 below standard retail pricing that already undercut GoPro’s flagship models for $464. The 15 percent discount brings pro 360 capture capabilities within enthusiasts’ reach who want creative flexibility beyond what rectangular action cameras provide.</p>

              <p>With modern laptops, connectivity was sacrificed for thin designs and give you two to three USB-C ports where you used to have a variety of choices in connecting your devices. This minimalist architecture now creates constant frustration when you try to hook up monitors, external drives, charging cables and peripherals all at once.</p>
<p>The <strong>14-in-1 docking station from Anker resolves this limitation by taking that single USB-C port</strong> and breaking it out into fourteen connection options that cover every device you might need to plug in. Amazon <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5770/">just dropped this hub to a record low of $39 for Black Friday, down from the usual $69 price</a>, which makes essential connectivity affordable.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5770/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Triple Display Expands Your Workspace</h2>
<p><strong>Dual 4K HDMI and a 1080p VGA port</strong> enable three-monitor setups that transform how one works with multiple applications and documents. You can dedicate one screen to email and communications, another to active work, and a third to reference materials or monitoring dashboards. The 4K resolution on HDMI outputs brings sharp text and detailed images, which help reduce eye fatigue during extended work sessions. The VGA port keeps compatibility with older projectors and monitors that businesses and conference rooms still use frequently. Windows users get true <strong>extended desktops across all three displays</strong>, while macOS mirrors the same content to all connected monitors due to operating system limitations.</p>



<p>The <strong>five USB-A ports</strong> accommodate legacy devices like external hard drives, printers, webcams, and wired keyboards that haven’t yet moved to USB-C connections. The 5 Gbps transfer speed will handle file operations well, transferring gigabytes of data in minutes, not the glacial speeds of older USB 2.0 hubs. <strong>A dedicated USB-C data port adds another high-speed connection</strong> for newer devices while matching the same 5 Gbps throughput. That matters when backing up large photo libraries, transferring video projects, or syncing substantial data sets between devices.</p>
<p>The p<strong>ass-through charging of 80 watts powers</strong> your laptop through the hub while using all connected devices. You plug your laptop’s USB-C charger into the hub’s power input, and the hub distributes power to your laptop while maintaining all connectivity functions. This single cable solution means your laptop charges while accessing all peripherals without juggling multiple power adapters.</p>



<p>The <strong>Gigabit Ethernet port</strong> ensures solid wired network connections that avoid unreliable Wi-Fi in crowded offices or when maximum upload and download speeds matter. Wired connections eliminate the latency spikes and bandwidth competition that wireless networks introduce during video calls or large file transfers. The consistent throughput supports remote desktop sessions, video conferencing, and cloud backup operations that demand reliable connectivity. The <strong>SD and microSD card slots</strong> handle camera cards and storage expansion without separate card readers cluttering up your desk. The <strong>AUX port</strong> connects wired headphones or external speakers, preserving audio quality that Bluetooth sometimes compresses.</p>
<p>Compatibility extends to USB-C, USB4, and Thunderbolt-equipped laptops running Windows 10 and 11, ChromeOS, or macOS 12 and newer. The hub expects that your laptop’s USB-C port supports DisplayPort Alt Mode for video output and Power Delivery for charging functionality. Most modern business laptops and MacBooks boast both features, although some budget laptops with USB-C ports omit the required protocols.</p>
<p>For $39, you’re getting professional docking station functionality at almost half the $69 standard price that already undercut dedicated docking solutions costing $150 or more. The 43% discount brings essential connectivity to remote workers and office users who’ve struggled with inadequate laptop ports.</p>

              <p>Smartwatches compete based on health tracking accuracy and ecosystem integration, and Apple Watch remains on top despite premium pricing starting at $399 for the latest Series 10. Samsung’s Galaxy Watch 7 brings similar health metrics, AI-powered insights, and advanced sleep tracking at a fraction of Apple’s cost, and Amazon<a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5766/"> just dropped it to a record low of $129 for Black Friday, down from its $249 retail price</a>. That nearly 50% discount undercuts even older Apple Watch models, but you get hardware that Samsung quietly released earlier this year.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5766/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Galaxy AI Powers Personalized Health Insights</h2>
<p>The <strong>Energy Score calculates your daily physical readiness</strong> by analyzing yesterday’s activity, sleep quality, heart rate patterns, and recovery metrics. This AI-driven analysis tells you if your body is prepared for hard work or needs lighter activities and rest. The score updates every morning, based on the data collected during the night, providing actionable information before you plan your day’s training. <strong>Samsung’s AI analyses that data</strong> on the paired phone rather than in the cloud, keeping health data private while providing personalized recommendations. Over time, the system learns your patterns to fine-tune accuracy while gathering more data about your unique physiology and response to different levels of activity.</p>
<p><strong>Performance tracking provides real-time comparisons</strong> of your current run or bike ride to past sessions, showing exactly where you’re maintaining, improving, or falling behind your pace. It’s that real-time feedback that lets you dial in your effort during a workout, rather than finding out later that you underperformed. The Galaxy AI removes movement artifacts from the heart rate signals of exercising users, improving the accuracy in cases where an individual’s arms are swinging or vibrations impact sensor contact.</p>



<p>S<strong>leep tracking follows your rest cycles</strong> and detects patterns that show poor sleep quality or probable health issues. For example, the watch identifies light sleep, deep sleep, REM stages, and periods of wakefulness throughout the night with accuracy that rivals dedicated sleep tracking devices. From there, Samsung’s AI analyzes the data to provide recommendations for improving sleep hygiene, adjusting bedtime routines, or modifying evening habits that interfere with quality rest. The sleep apnea detection feature screens for moderate and severe cases by monitoring breathing disruptions and oxygen levels during sleep.</p>
<p>Wellness tips provides<strong> personalized recommendations from the advanced health data</strong> your watch gathers all day. Its AI looks at patterns of activity, stress levels, and sleep quality, along with heart rate trends, to identify areas in which small changes may help optimize overall wellbeing. Such advice isn’t just about general fitness; it comments on real-life behavior and physiological responses unique to each person. The system may recommend earlier bedtimes when it observes accumulated sleep debt, advise stress management techniques during especially tense weeks, or encourage one to move more on days when mostly sedentary.</p>



<p>The<strong> 40mm case size fits smaller wrists comfortably</strong> without the bulk larger smartwatches create. Bluetooth connectivity keeps a stable connection to your phone for notifications, calls, and data syncing without requiring cellular service that adds to monthly fees. Battery life extends through a full day and night of continuous health tracking, though exact duration varies based on which features you enable and how often you interact with the watch.</p>
<p>Samsung’s ecosystem integration works seamlessly with Galaxy phones but <strong>also functions with other Android devices and even iPhones</strong>, though some features require Samsung hardware for full functionality. The watch face customization options let you prioritize which health metrics appear prominently, adjusting the display to show the data you actually care about rather than generic layouts.</p>
<p>At $129, you’re getting Samsung’s latest smartwatch technology at nearly half the price of entry-level Apple Watch models that don’t offer comparable AI-powered health insights. For those who have been priced out of the smartwatch market by Apple’s premium positioning, this 48% discount brings flagship health tracking within reach.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Cloud storage subscriptions will drain your budget month after month and leave you dependent on internet connectivity to access your own files. The Seagate 22TB HDD offers enough capacity for massive photo libraries and years of accumulated digital content in one device, and Amazon <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5769/">just dropped this drive to a record low of $229 for Black Friday</a>, and while that compares to a typical $249 price, <strong>this same drive sold for $599 until just days ago</strong>. That represents a 60% discount from the price you’ve seen throughout the past year and the lowest this capacity has ever cost.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5769/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>22TB Eliminates Storage Anxiety Completely</h2>
<p>The h<strong>uge 22-terabyte capacity stores around 5,500 hours of HD video, 5.5 million high-resolution photos</strong>, or 440,000 songs at resolutions without compression or quality loss. With this much space, you can keep everything instead of making painstaking choices over what to delete or archive. Professional photographers maintain RAW file libraries spanning entire careers without resorting to cloud services. Video editors store entire project files complete with all source footage, renders, and iterations available instantly. It<strong> handles 4K and even 8K video projects</strong> that consume hundreds of gigabytes per hour of footage.</p>
<p><strong>USB 3.0 connectivity delivers transfer speeds up to 5 Gbps</strong> under ideal conditions; you could be moving large files in minutes, not hours. The real world, of course, will vary depending on the USB implementation on your host computer and the drive’s mechanical performance, but sustained transfers of about 100-150 MB per second for sequential file operations are within reason. This speed manages general backup tasks efficiently without tying up your computer for extended periods. Transfers of large files, such as moving an entire photo shoot or backing up a video project, complete within reasonable time frames.</p>



<p>Seagate includes <em>Rescue Data Recovery Services</em> that provide professional data recovery should the drive fail mechanically or suffer logical corruption. This service covers the cost of laboratory recovery attempts that cost hundreds, if not thousands, of dollars if you were to buy them separately. It’s the peace of mind when you’re storing family photos, work for clients, or a lifetime of creative work on a single device.</p>
<p>The plug-and-play design instantly works with Windows and Mac computers, requiring no software installation or complicated setup procedures. It means that Windows will immediately recognize the drive and assign a drive letter to it, ready for use. If you are a Mac user, you can easily reformat it to APFS or HFS+, although it will ship formatted for compatibility right out of the box.</p>



<p>The drive’s performance suits cold storage and archival purposes where you are writing data once and reading it occasionally, rather than running active databases or applications. Time Machine backups on Mac or File History on Windows work perfectly with this drive’s speed characteristics. Media servers streaming video to local network devices perform well since the sequential read speeds handle multiple concurrent streams.</p>
<p>Yes, this means that at $229, <strong>you are getting 22 terabytes of storage for just a little over $10 per terabyte</strong>. That is exceptional value that was not around at this price until now. The 60% discount from the $599 price that prevailed until recently brings enterprise-scale storage capacity to consumer budgets. This Black Friday deal has space enough to consolidate several smaller drives, cancel cloud storage subscriptions, or simply stop worrying about storage limitations for several years.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>On June 13, 2017, <a href="https://kotaku.com/nintendo-announces-metroid-prime-4-1796058481">Nintendo surprised millions of people by announcing that <em>Metroid Prime 4</em> was happening</a>. Nearly a decade later, the game is finally almost here. But <em>Metroid Prime 4</em>, now called <em>Metroid Prime 4: Beyond,</em> is launching on Switch 2 as well as the OG console, and is being developed by original <em>Prime</em> devs Retro Studios and not Bandai Namco. Needless to say, a lot has changed since 2017.</p> <p>But all these years later, some people still have <em>Metroid Prime 4</em> pre-orders from years ago and are finally ready to play the long-awaited sequel.</p> <p>People began pre-ordering <a href="https://kotaku.com/metroid-prime-4-previews-trailer-ncps-companion-2000644368"><em>Metroid Prime 4</em></a>, launching on Switch and Switch 2 on December 3, shortly after it was announced. That was back in 2017. And over the years, people continued to pre-order the game despite the dearth of updates from Nintendo. <a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/thenintendoswitch/posts/9086282311436961/">You can find people who pre-ordered as early as June 2017,</a> just days after it was revealed. Now, years later, some of these people are remembering that they pre-ordered <em>Prime 4</em> back in the day.</p>   <p>“Oh, okay, thanks for the email. I definitely forgot I already ordered <em>Metroid Prime 4</em> six years ago,” <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/nameoftheyear.bsky.social/post/3lyoobfolys2m">said Elliot on social media</a>. Later, we chatted about the years-old pre-order and they told me they plan on buying it still on Switch as opposed to Switch 2, as they prefer to physically own games, and <em>Prime 4</em> on the new console is a digital key card. As for what they felt when they got that email: “Surprise.”</p>

 <p>“[I laughed when] I got that email update from Best Buy in Sept, out of the blue, I suppose whenever Nintendo updated the release date,” Elliot told me. “I pre-ordered a really large order of Switch games on Best Buy in 2019, particularly because my gamer club 10% discount would be expiring soon. I’m pretty sure this order was placed shortly after a Nintendo Direct, too. (The <em>Animal Crossing</em> one?) So those two factors convinced me to drop like $250 on upcoming releases across 2019-2020. Which included <em>Metroid Prime 4</em> at the time!”</p>

 <p>Elliot isn’t alone. You can find plenty of people online who <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Metroid/comments/1jtyzmj/you_think_best_buys_going_to_honor_my_4799/">pre-ordered <em>Metroid Prime 4</em> between</a> <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Metroid/comments/1nfmrwi/best_buy_remembered_my_preorder_for_metroid_prime/">2018 and 2019 at Best Buy</a> using the Gamer Club discount. Some were able to get a pretty good deal on the game using various discounts and credits, which feels like even more of a steal in 2025 as games get more and more expensive.</p>

 <p>One of the people who took advantage of that Gamer Club deal was Bluesky user Bucket Mouse. They pre-ordered <em>Prime 4</em> in 2018, and since then, a lot has changed in their life.</p>   <p>“Since my preorder, I’ve finished grad school, switched careers, started a small business, bought a house, and had three children,” <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/mousebitelabs.bsky.social/post/3m63si3vrbk2m">Bucket Mouse told me via social media reply</a>. “….Dang. I’ve never put this in context; it’s really mind-blowing that we’ve been waiting this long.” When asked if they are still excited about playing <em>Metroid Prime 4</em> after all these years, they told me: “I am beyond excited. I’m taking off work to play it!”</p>

 <p>Bluesky user Rebecca Stone told me that her 2019 pre-order of <em>Prime 4</em> <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/forestminish.tv/post/3m63rfnppoc2k">was at one point canceled</a> and removed from her account years ago. However, she was able to revive the pre-order and will now be getting a copy of <em>Metroid Prime 4</em> very soon.</p>

 <p>And while not everyone was lucky enough to hold on to their pre-orders, <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/docseuss.bsky.social/post/3m63oqj2g2k2x">with Amazon cancelling many of them earlier this year</a>, there are plenty of folks who, in December, are going to be playing a game they pre-ordered when their life was very different. Like Bluesky user Milton, who shared how their life had changed since pre-ordering five years ago, posting:</p> <p>“Apparently, I pre-ordered <em>Metroid Prime 4</em> back in March 2020,” they posted.&nbsp; “I’ve had a whole-ass child, bought a house, and Nintendo released a whole new console in that time. Donald Trump is still president, tho.”</p>
