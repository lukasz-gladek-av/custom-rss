            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Apple introduced the new iPhone 17 and AirPods Pro 3 just a few days ago, and even though they are available only from Friday, something totally absurd is happening: <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4214/">Amazon of is now offering the AirPods Pro 3 at $239, which is $10 lower than Apple’s current offering</a>. This kind of day-one price reduction by Amazon is unheard of and it’s mind-blowing to see this kind of thing occur so rapidly with brand-new materials.</p>

<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4214/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>
<h2>Better Sound with Clever Features</h2>
<p>These AirPods Pro 3 offer what is perhaps some of the <strong>best in-ear active noise cancellation available on the market</strong>. Apple has raised the stakes with a guarantee to <strong>cut out twice as much extraneous noise as the AirPods Pro 2</strong> so when you’re listening with them, you’re fully immersed in your music (<a href="https://gizmodo.com/airpods-pro-3-review-skating-to-where-the-puck-is-going-not-where-it-has-been-2000658726">check out the AirPods Pro 3 review at Gizmodo here</a>). It’s not just about noise-blocking, though – they’ve completely rebooted the sound experience. The <strong>3D spatial sound creates this amazing depth</strong> where you can clearly hear every instrument, the bass is more complete and vocals are heard in glorious detail.</p>
<p>And then <strong>there’s the heart rate sensor</strong>. Yes, these earbuds don’t only pump sound; they track your heart rate and calories burned during any of up to 50 different workouts. Coupled with the fitness capabilities of your iPhone, including the Move ring and new Workout Buddy, you’ve got a dead serious personal trainer in your ears. Cool, right?</p>



<p><strong>Live translation</strong> is fueled by Apple Intelligence and it’s another doozy: That equates to being able to overcome language barriers in real time when you’re chatting with friends or traveling abroad. The feature is intelligent and effortless so conversation is like you shared the same language.</p>
<p>Battery life is also excellent as you can listen<strong> for 8 hours with Active Noise Cancellation on</strong>, and 10 hours when you’re listening with Transparency mode enabled with Hearing Aid. And<strong> new ear tips come in five sizes</strong> so you can find your best fit for yourself, with them staying put and sound even better.</p>
<p>With these changes in mind, it’s incredible to think that Amazon is offering them for less than Apple charges. If this combination of features and this price is sounding like a deal too good to resist, that’s because it is. Don’t wait too long – this sale doesn’t last forever.</p>

              <p>Small power banks normally only do as much as charging up phones, and that’s it. However, if you want a small charger that also can charge your laptop,<strong> this Ugreen 145W 25,000mAh model is something to consider</strong>. It’s rather revolutionary in its segment and is being sold in store on Amazon as an early Prime Day deal: Right now, <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4212/">it’s dropping to an all-time low price of $66, down from $99</a>.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4212/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Compact Powerhouse with Laptop-Level Charging</h2>
<p>Ugreen’s power bank doesn’t just handle phones but it also tackles laptops and other high-demand devices with ease. Equipped with a <strong>massive 25,000mAh battery</strong>, it offers enough juice to fully recharge laptops about 1.3 times and phones up to 5.2 times.</p>



<p>What distinguishes the model is its <strong>turbo-speed 145W charging through PD3.1 and QC3.0 technology</strong>. Standout is the USB-C1 port, which has a capacity of up to 140W. That equates to charging a 16-inch MacBook Pro from zero to 56% in 30 minutes which is a quick pace for a portable charger. Besides that, there is two-way fast charging, meaning with a 65W or higher charger, you can easily top-up the power bank itself in roughly 2 hours.</p>
<p>The convenience factor is also very high with a very slim and light weight design that can be <strong>carried in any backpack or even a large pocket</strong>. There is a digital showing that displays the battery level clearly, so you will never be left stranded by low power at a critical time.</p>
<p>For $66 on Amazon with a 34% discount, it’s an all-time low price for a portable charger with serious power without serious bulk.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/3x-cheaper-than-apple-headphones-this-hp-laptop-with-windows-11-is-flying-off-the-shelves-2000627472</link>

              <p>With hundreds of laptops available today, it almost feels like there’s one model for every person out there. But if you’re working with a tighter budget and don’t want to settle for a Chromebook without Windows, there’s a solid option to consider: This HP 14-inch laptop (64GB storage) is packing Windows 11 Home and ranks among the top 5 bestsellers on Amazon—and right now, <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3762/">it’s hitting its lowest price for a Windows laptop we’ve seen at $171, down from $229</a>.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3762/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>A Budget Windows Laptop for Everyday Use</h2>
<p>It has a razor-thin and light design along with a <strong>14-inch HD micro-edge bezel display of only 6.5mm</strong> and provides an immersive viewing experience with a 79% screen-to-body ratio. That is, you are nearly entirely viewing screen when you look at it which is ideal if you want a laptop that is up-to-date in terms of appearance without the clunky body. The 1366×768 screen resolution offers sharp images that will play nicely for streaming and the thin bezel renders the machine compact enough to carry around all day long.</p>



<p>Internally, the Intel Celeron N4020 dual-core processor strikes a balance between energy efficiency and power. It’s not meant for heavy users doing intensive tasks like video editing or all-day gaming sessions but it’s good enough for everyday use and does it while monitoring battery life to take you through the day. Intel UHD Graphics 600 offers streaming capabilities for 4K media and light games, so it satisfies light media needs with ease. The laptop’s 4GB of RAM enhances multitasking abilities and speeds up app switching, making it less frustrating during those hectic moments.</p>
<p>Storage is acceptable considering the price with a 64GB embedded multimedia flash card providing quick access to your files and software, though you might want additional external or cloud storage if you’re creating high-definition video or large sets of photography. Windows 11 Home edition comes pre-installed, which gives you the updated features and interface improvements, which make the device run quicker and easier to navigate than older releases of Windows or limited systems like Chromebooks.</p>
<p>If your laptop needs aren’t fancy but you want something that runs Windows just fine, this one’s worth a look.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/lego-is-offloading-the-harry-potter-hogwarts-castle-for-early-prime-day-now-selling-at-a-steal-2000627467</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/lego-is-offloading-the-harry-potter-hogwarts-castle-for-early-prime-day-now-selling-at-a-steal.1303722/</guid>

              <p>Harry Potter and Star Wars have always been LEGO’s biggest hits, and that’s no accident. These sets click with fans in a way few things do: they’re beautifully designed, instantly recognizable and tap into stories that people love to revisit.</p>
<p>Out of all of them, the <strong>Hogwarts castle and grounds</strong> set is one that really captures the magic. It’s <strong>sitting at a 4.8 out of 5 rating with nearly 2,000 reviews</strong>, which should tell you just how much people enjoy it. And the timing couldn’t be better: <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4207/">right now on Amazon it’s down to $136 from $169, the lowest price it’s ever been</a>. With early Prime Day deals already dropping, this one could vanish quickly if stock runs out.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4207/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Creating The Magic of Hogwarts at Home</h2>
<p>There’s something special about seeing Hogwarts assemble before your own eyes, piece by piece. It’s not just the castle – it’s the grounds and the castle, in LEGO detail for the very first time ever. <strong>With 2,660 pieces</strong>, you’ve got a project that’s in-depth without being overwhelming. When finished, it’s <strong>more than 8.5 inches tall, 13.5 inches wide, and 10 inches deep</strong>, a near-perfect balance between stand-out large and fit-as-a-book small.</p>
<p>And the details, those details – those create the magic. The Great Hall, the Astronomy Tower, the greenhouses, bridges, courtyards, the Boathouse on the Black Lake—it’s all there. Hidden spots bring more surprises: the Chamber of Secrets, the Potions Classroom, the Winged Key room, and the giant chessboard chamber. Out on the lake you’ll notice the Beauxbatons Carriage and the Durmstrang Ship, while the Whomping Willow (complete with a flying Ford Anglia) adds another nod to the films.</p>



<p>And then of course, is the actual enjoyment, which is building. Sets like these are built with adult fans in mind and give you a project that you can get your hands on, recharging while creating. It’s the kind of build that feels almost meditative: you settle in, sort the bricks, and step by step construct one of the most iconic landmarks from the Wizarding World. And when you’re done, it isn’t just a pile of bricks, it’s a model that looks fantastic on display and instantly sparks conversations.</p>
<p>What makes this deal even sweeter is the price point. At $136, you’re getting a set this detailed for less than many similar adult-oriented LEGO models which often climb past $200. With the number of pieces, the design quality, and Harry Potter set popularity in mind, this is one of those offers that does not sit around.</p>
