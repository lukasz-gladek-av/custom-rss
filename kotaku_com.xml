Fans love to see crazy story beats, especially when they result in unique fights or new characters. A great example of this is Gohan Black, a fun twist on the diabolical Goku Black. He’s become popular enough that everyone wants to play as him, although that’s easier said than done.</p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="194972" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="This Lesbian Mafia Anime Might Actually Make You Want To Play Golf" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="135" data-playlist="194972,195064,197298" data-current="194972"><div><p>This Lesbian Mafia Anime Might Actually Make You Want To Play Golf</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/194972/194972_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/194972/194972_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/194972/194972_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/194972/194972_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/20419.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>This what-if villain has his own story arc hidden behind a tough fight. It’s not as bad or confusing as <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/dragon-ball-sparking-zero-jiren-endings-guide-1851680142&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/dragon-ball-sparking-zero-jiren-endings-guide-1851680142">getting all of Jiren’s endings</a></span>, but I wouldn’t blame you if you’ve had trouble unlocking it. We’re going to lay out how to encounter him within Episode Battle as well as your options for playing the new villain yourself.</p><h2 id="h5119"><a id=""></a>Who is Gohan Black?</h2><p>Gohan Black is an original character for <em>Dragon Ball: Sparking Zero</em>, although I’m sure there exists plenty of fanfics already out there based on the idea. If the name or my brief explanation above didn’t already give it away, <strong>Gohan Black is the product of a what-if story where Zamasu doesn’t switch bodies with Goku, but with his firstborn son instead</strong>.</p><p>Everyone has taken a strong liking to this neat twist and plenty have voiced their preference for Gohan as a villain over his dad. Of course, it’s not just the lore that’s left us all excited. Gohan Black is a surprisingly detailed inclusion for the game. While he does share a moveset with Goku Black, he comes with an exclusive portrait and his own voice acting. There is even more to show on the back end of things.</p><p>Within the story mode he doesn’t seem like a finished character since he only uses basic rush combos and vanish attacks. Data miners have discovered more work went into him than thought as he has voice work for all of his unused supers and skills. He even has a special battle introduction dialogue interaction against Goku, which would only be viewable in a versus mode.</p><p>I have no doubt that this would have been a popular what-if character on their own. It’s thanks to the above aspects, both what’s presented and found within the game’s files, that he’s managed to whip fans into a frenzy about playing him. Before we get to your options for doing that, let’s go over how to fight him in the story mode.</p><h2 id="h5120"><a id=""></a>How to Fight Gohan Black in Episode Battle</h2><figure id="" data-id="f5a533a44c1fce1dcc5334d9eebcd0e5" data-recommend-id="image://f5a533a44c1fce1dcc5334d9eebcd0e5" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Gohan’s Episode Battle map with his Defend Earth from the Frieza Force! mission highlighted." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Gohan’s Episode Battle map with his Defend Earth from the Frieza Force! mission highlighted." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Bandai Namco / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="f5a533a44c1fce1dcc5334d9eebcd0e5" data-recommend-id="image://f5a533a44c1fce1dcc5334d9eebcd0e5" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Gohan’s Episode Battle map with his Defend Earth from the Frieza Force! mission highlighted." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p><strong>Gohan Black is only fought through The Strongest Warrior story arc, which can be unlocked in Chapter 5 of Gohan’s Saga.</strong> To be more precise, you’ll need to complete the alternate objective in the “Defend Earth from the Frieza Force”<em> </em>mission, which simply reads as “Defeat the Frieza Force Soldier, then corner Frieza.”</p><p>That doesn’t tell you much, but I was able to clear it the same way most other alternate objectives are cleared: dealing a lot of damage as fast as I could. This can be a challenge since you have to fight against two enemies. I recommend charging your Ki whenever possible to enter the Sparking! Mode, that way you can get them caught in long rush combos and land your Ultimate Blast on them. Using Gohan’s Full Power Charge skill will also save time by instantly filling up your Ki gauge.</p><p>Don’t forget that lowering the difficulty will prevent you from completing an alternate objective. If you’re still having trouble finishing this fast enough, I recommend using a Dragon Orb to give yourself more time. These can be gained from wishes after you’ve summoned a dragon. This is a pretty tough battle, so it’s worth using them here.</p><p><strong>Read More:</strong> <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/dragon-ball-sparkling-zero-summoning-wishes-shenron-1851672547&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/dragon-ball-sparkling-zero-summoning-wishes-shenron-1851672547">Getting To Grips With <em>Dragon Ball: Sparking Zero</em>’s Wish-Granting Dragons</a></span></p><p>Getting through the fight quickly enough will lead you down The Strongest Warrior path, which starts with two more fights against Frieza. Defeating the space tyrant for good will cause Gohan to prioritize training more, leading him to catch the attention of Zamasu. This creates an altered version of the Future Trunks Arc highlighted by Gohan Black.</p><p>You’ll then be able to fight against the character that everyone wants. As mentioned earlier, he refrains from using any supers and just throws out rush combos and vanish attacks. That doesn’t mean he’s a pushover by any stretch of the imagination. Feel free to try out some of the <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/dragon-ball-sparking-zero-battle-assist-guide-1851685568&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/dragon-ball-sparking-zero-battle-assist-guide-1851685568">Battle Assist settings</a></span> or even lower the difficulty if his combos keep melting your health bar. This story arc is a straight shot without any branching paths, so you won’t miss anything by taking it easy.</p><p>There are four more fights for the story after this, including one against Gohan Black in an Ultimate-like transformation that rivals Goku Black’s Rose Form. The last two fights are against Fused Zamasu, who now sports a long bang in front of his face just like Gohan. Beat every mission to unlock The Strongest Warrior achievement and finish this fun alternate scenario.</p><h2 id="h5121"><a id=""></a>How to Play as Gohan Black</h2><figure id="" data-id="89ec992d77795f84b69b1dab9fcac30a" data-recommend-id="image://89ec992d77795f84b69b1dab9fcac30a" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Gohan Black stares at the camera with a grimace during a cutscene." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Gohan Black stares at the camera with a grimace during a cutscene." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Bandai Namco / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="89ec992d77795f84b69b1dab9fcac30a" data-recommend-id="image://89ec992d77795f84b69b1dab9fcac30a" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Gohan Black stares at the camera with a grimace during a cutscene." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p><strong>If you’re looking to properly add Gohan Black to your roster, I’m sorry to say that currently isn’t an option.</strong> Some want him to be a separate character and others want him to be a special outfit for Goku Black since the two do share the same move set. Unfortunately, <em>Dragon Ball: Sparking Zero</em> doesn’t have any hidden fighters to unlock, nor any unique cosmetics that overhaul a character.</p><p>That’s not to say Gohan Black couldn’t be made available later on down the road. All the unused voice lines and altered visual effects could go to waste if he was made playable as a separate character. Having him be a cosmetic for the character he’s based on would make the most sense. There is a small precedent for a character’s outfit affecting things too, with Android 18 and Goku (Super) having one each that changes one of their super attacks.</p><p>You do have a couple of “less official” methods if you play on PC. <strong>The first is likely what you expect: search online and find a mod that swaps out Goku Black for Gohan Black.</strong> Thanks to so many assets already available in the game, mods for this come off pretty seamlessly. Online opponents will just see regular Goku Black while you will see the edgy what-if character of your dreams.</p><p>The second method is a uniquely bizarre workaround that doesn’t require you to have any mods installed on your end. Modders have realized that if they load in non-playable character models that are already in the game’s files (such as for story or super cutscene purposes) and publish them through the Custom Battles feature, anyone who plays it will be able to use those same models. <strong>That means you can play Gohan Black on PC by searching through the Custom Battle feature and finding one with him in it.</strong></p><p>Gohan Black is arguably the most stable example of the wacky NPCs you can find. This is likely a testament to how “complete” he’s presented as. However, these battles don’t stay up long and are less likely to pop up in the future. Bandai Namco has been very upfront about the fact that those who upload modded Custom Battles <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://x.com/dragonballgames/status/1851449322375696669&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://x.com/dragonballgames/status/1851449322375696669" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">will be banned</a></span>. That shouldn’t threaten anyone playing them, but who knows exactly how they’ll handle this weird situation. I’d recommend looking for mods to be on the safe side. Most of these player-made battles are super difficult and against the strongest fighters in the game anyway.</p><hr><p><em>Dragon Ball: Sparking Zero</em> has a big roster filled with different <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/dragon-ball-sparking-zero-unlock-every-character-shop-1851670640&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/dragon-ball-sparking-zero-unlock-every-character-shop-1851670640">characters to unlock</a></span>, but it is lacking a few fan-favorites. Which is why it means a lot that so many are calling for an original character like this to be added. We know that the DLC announced so far will include fighters from <em>Dragon Ball Super: Super Hero</em> and Dragon Ball Daima, but that isn’t going to stop anyone from hoping that Gohan Black is made officially playable through an update.</p><p>.<br></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

It expanded the geographic scope of the show by taking Will, Eleven, and Jonathan to California, while still doubling down on the 80s nostalgia, shadowy intrigue, and paranormal phenomena that first made the <em>Goonies</em>-esque kids adventure a hit back in 2016. There wasn’t originally supposed to be a fifth season, but series creators Matt and Ross Duffer later extended the show’s ambitions after it blew up.</p><p>Fans are already pouring over the new episode titles for clues about where the show will head next before ultimately wrapping things up. Since the episode titles seemingly leaked months ago, the confirmation today provides a pretty good idea of whose name is blurred in the episode 2 title, while “The Rightside Up” seems like a fitting note for the show to go out on. </p><p>Of course, in the modern entertainment landscape it’s hard to see any super-popular franchise truly ending. Besides the spin-offs in various stages of planning, I’ll bet there’s always the prospect of a reunion movie down the road. </p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

But while many third-party franchises have toyed with LEGO collaboration in gaming, it’s a bit of a shock to see <em>LEGO Horizon Adventures</em>—based on a first-party Sony franchise—landing at our feet. </p><p>Despite how unusual it seems for <em>LEGO Horizon Adventures</em>, you may be even more surprised to see that it’s every bit the type of LEGO game fans have come to know and love over the years. So whether you’re on the fence about purchasing this new entry, or you’re just curious what to expect when you do, here’s what you should know about <em>LEGO Horizon Adventures</em>.</p></div></div><div><p><em>LEGO Horizon Adventures</em> is a kind of loose retelling of <em>Horizon Zero Dawn</em>, the 2017 PS4 open-world RPG, in a colorful, lighthearted LEGO world. It maintains the characters from the main series—Ashly Burch even reprises her role as main character Aloy—but the LEGO spin gives the whole experience a far more casual and family-friend vibe that ensures it’s accessible to all. Expect plenty of goofy humor and some abbreviated plot points as the game aims to keep you laughing and playing rather than watching cutscenes or reading dialogue.</p><p>Unsurprisingly, you don’t exclusively control Aloy this time around. Instead, like many LEGO games before it, <em>LEGO Horizon Adventures</em> allows you to unlock and play as a wider selection of characters, such as Varl, Rost, and Teersa. You can even equip various cosmetics to further customize your playtime, including costumes based on other beloved PlayStation characters. <br></p><p>Speaking of customization, you can also rearrange various things back at the central hub of Mother’s Heart—an iconic returning location from <em>Horizon Zero Dawn</em>. In an effort to make things genuinely feel like you’re inhabiting a LEGO world, you can mix and match things all across Mother’s Heart to make it really feel like your own creation.  </p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="b93c43fa74daf11f57e83e385d90319a" data-recommend-id="image://b93c43fa74daf11f57e83e385d90319a" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Aloy and Varl run across a LEGO jungle map." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Aloy and Varl run across a LEGO jungle map." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="false" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Sony</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="b93c43fa74daf11f57e83e385d90319a" data-recommend-id="image://b93c43fa74daf11f57e83e385d90319a" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Aloy and Varl run across a LEGO jungle map." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p><em>LEGO Horizon Adventures </em>was co-developed by Guerrilla Games and Studio Gobo. </p><p>As you probably know, the former is the developer of the mainline <em>Horizon </em>franchise, so you can rest assured that the team’s love of the series is in full swing here. The latter, however, has also made a name for itself by co-developing AAA titles like <em>Redfall </em>and <em>Hogwarts Legacy</em>, working hand in hand among the biggest teams in the business.
