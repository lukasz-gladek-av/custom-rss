            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/xbox-360-best-worst-arcade-games-netflix-store-closing-1851610163">20 years ago on May 12, 2005, the Xbox 360</a> and the future of video games was unveiled on MTV, and it was hosted by Elijah Wood. And while going back to this 20 minute show is a bit embarrassing now, it’s wild how Microsoft and Xbox really did see the future coming before the rest of the industry.</p> <p><em>This article was originally published on May 12, 2025. We’re re-posting it today in honor of the Xbox 360’s 20th anniversary.&nbsp;</em></p> <p>But before we praise <a href="https://kotaku.com/xbox-celebrates-20th-anniversary-with-a-museum-that-mig-1848113162">Xbox</a> for predicting the online future of games and get really sad at how cosmetic microtransactions were already part of the plan in 2005, let’s make fun of this weird 20 minute infomercial that is the most ‘00s thing ever created. Here’s the full special if you’ve not seen it:</p>

  <p>“Fact: Gaming isn’t just a hobby. It is a lifestyle,” says an unnamed narrator during a short video at the front of the special. It explains video gaming started with <em>Pong</em> and Atari, some other stuff happened, then the original Xbox launched and don’t worry about that thing called the PlayStation.</p>

 <p>After that, the funniest moment in the entire special happens. Remember, up until this point we didn’t know the console was to be called the Xbox 360. It was just the “Next Gen Xbox.” So young Zack, who watched this MTV special back in 2005, was excited to learn more about the next Xbox. Elijah Wood yells, <a href="https://youtu.be/LTs0AoaMYGA?t=166" target="_blank" rel="noopener">“The future of gaming!” and points off screen</a>. The camera cuts to a…woman carrying a gray bag. Can you imagine the online chuds today watching this? Their heads might explode.</p>

  <p>In reality, the woman is carrying the Xbox 360 in her shoulder bag. She saunters up to a podium and pulls out the console. Sets it up. Hits a button. Green lights turn on. And the console’s name is revealed.</p>

 <p>The rest of special is mostly MTV nonsense, celebrities, and The Killers performing music. The only segment that is actually somewhat interesting happens about 11 minutes into the show: Sway from MTV is invited to talk to the designers behind the Xbox 360 and J Allard (one of the OG Microsoft execs behind the Xbox project.) It’s during this segment that we see a bunch of 360 prototypes and learn about why it looks the way it does. And then Allard walks Sway through the idea of buying digital content on a video game console using the internet.</p>

 <p>Today, this is something every device can do. Back in 2005, this was the future. It was hard for young Zack to believe that one day we’d buy games digitally on a console. 20 years later, it’s clear Microsoft was on to something with Xbox Live, the marketplace, a single username that follows you from game to game, and hanging out online with friends in voice chat. Though, the moment when Allard mentions buying clothes for your digital character, I realized microtransactions were being invented in front of my eyes and got sad.</p> <p>At the end of the event, Wood got on stage and signed off by saying: “I think we can all agree on one thing tonight: Xbox 360 is going to be amazing and I look forward to meeting all of you in the Xbox 360 universe.” I never met Elijah Wood online. But I do agree, the Xbox 360 was amazing and will likely be the one and only time Microsoft was at the top of the console gaming market.</p>

              <p>Competition in premium headphones has never been as fierce as it is currently with Apple, Sonos, Bose, Sony, and Beats in a heated contest over the over-ear market. Each brand brings legitimate quality to the table which makes choosing sound alone an increasingly difficult decision. The tiebreaker becomes price when comparable products are competing at similar performance, and Beats just made that decision incredibly easy. Amazon <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5824/">just crushed the Beats Studio Pro to $149 for Black Friday, down from $349, delivering a 57% discount no competitor can match</a>.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5824/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>40-Hour Battery Life Outlasts Every Competitor</h2>
<p>The <strong>battery endurance is up to 40 hours of playback with active noise cancellation on</strong>, beating what Sony, Bose, and Apple offer at any price. You charge these headphones once and use them for an entire week of commuting, working, and exercising without seeing low battery warnings. The extended runtime transforms how you think about wireless headphones since charging becomes a weekly ritual rather than a daily annoyance. Fast Fuel charging adds 4 hours of playback from just 10 minutes of charging when you forget to plug in overnight.</p>
<p><strong>Lossless audio via USB-C</strong> (paired with compatible sources over cable) provides audio quality that even an audiophile can appreciate. Wired mode switches off Bluetooth compression entirely, ensuring studio-quality playback that simply can’t be replicated by wireless transmission. Three built-in sound profiles allow the listener to tailor the listening experience to the content or personal preference.</p>



<p>This custom acoustic platform creates rich and immersive sound that is on par with many headphones costing considerably more. The bass response remains controlled without bleeding into midrange frequencies, and the vocals sit clearly atop the mix. High frequencies extend smoothly without any harshness to cause fatigue in long listening sessions.</p>
<p><strong>Fully adaptive active noise cancellation continuously adjusts based on your environment</strong> and fit on your head. The system monitors external noise and internal seal and optimizes cancellation in real time as conditions change. Transparency mode lets outside sound through naturally when you need awareness of your surroundings. Switching between modes happens instantly through on-ear controls without interrupting playback.</p>
<p>Personalized spatial audio with <strong>dynamic head tracking provides a fully immersive 360-degree listening experience</strong>. The system interacts with your head movements and adjusts audio placement to maintain the exact positioning of the sound elements, even as you move your head to either side. This technology works with compatible content to accurately place instruments and vocals in three-dimensional space around you.</p>



<p>Improved compatibility<strong> works seamlessly across both Apple and Android ecosystems</strong>. One-touch pairing connects straight away to iPhones via the Apple chip inside, while similar quick-pairing functionality is in place for Android devices. Native features work across the board, unlike some competitors, where specific operating systems receive the best features.</p>
<p>On-ear controls manage music playback, phone calls, and voice assistant activation without reaching for your phone. The physical buttons offer a type of tactile feedback that touch controls can’t compete with, enabling adjustments to be done without looking or removing the headphones. Siri, Google Assistant, or other voice assistants are activated with the press of a button for hands-free queries.</p>
<p>For $149, you get premium noise-cancelling headphones with 40-hour battery life and lossless audio for 57% off of its MSRP, which puts it below budget competition offering far less value. Sony’s WH-1000XM5 and Bose QuietComfort Ultra are $300-$400 options that don’t offer near the same level of battery life.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><strong>Amazon saves its best Black Friday deals for Prime members</strong>, and this portable monitor shows why the membership pays for itself, quite literally. Non-subscribers see regular pricing, while Prime members unlock exclusive discounts that slash products down to absurd lows. The <em>KYY</em> 15.6-inch portable monitor handles both <strong>gaming and productivity with a Full HD IPS display</strong> that travels anywhere your laptop goes. Amazon <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4362/">dropped this to $66 for Black Friday, down from $99, but only Prime members access this record low pricing</a>.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4362/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Desktop-Quality Visuals Anywhere</h2>
<p>The <strong>Full HD display gives 1920×1080 resolution for sharp text and clear images throughout the 15.6-inch display</strong> panel. The IPS technology assures accurate colors and consistent brightness from any viewing angle of up to 178 degrees. You see the same image quality whether you look straight on or from the side, which counts if you do group work or adjustable setups. HDR technology enhances contrast between bright and dark areas, making games and movies look more dynamic. The display reduces blue light radiation and eliminates flickering to protect your eyes against fatigue during extended viewing.</p>



<p><strong>USB-C connectivity enables single-cable connections</strong> that handle video signal and power delivery in tandem on compatible devices. You plug in one cable to laptops supporting Thunderbolt 3 or USB-C 3.1, and the monitor works immediately without external power. The two USB-C ports make way for different device connections and cable routing preferences. Mini-HDMI input accommodates devices lacking USB-C video output, ensuring compatibility with older laptops, gaming consoles, and desktop computers.</p>
<p>The<strong> ultra-slim profile of 0.3 inches and a weight of 1.7 pounds</strong>&nbsp;make this portable, rather than just technically portable. You slip this into a laptop bag beside your computer without adding any noticeable bulk or weight. The slim build fits in the same compartments as tablets or thin ultrabooks do. This kind of portability changes the way you think about workspace setup, as bringing a second monitor along becomes simple.</p>



<p>The <strong>included smart cover protects the screen</strong> during transport and converts into an adjustable stand for desktop use. Being budget-friendly, the exterior uses PU leather that resists scratches and feels premium. Two grooves in the bottom of the cover provide different viewing angles for comfort with multiple setups. The magnetic frameless design of this keeps the cover attached securely without adding bulk or interfering with the display.</p>
<p><strong>Compatibility with gaming consoles</strong> extends the monitor’s usability beyond laptop productivity. You hook up a Playstation 4, Xbox, or Switch directly to this for portable big-screen gaming anywhere. Hotel rooms, guest bedrooms, or any space with a power outlet becomes a gaming station. The native 1080p resolution of the console output is matched and color accuracy from the IPS panel is better than many hotel TVs.</p>
<p><strong>Connectivity to your smartphone transforms the monitor into a desktop experience</strong> for your mobile device. You will connect compatible phones via USB-C and expand your mobile workspace into a proper screen size. This feature works great for presentations, video watching, or using mobile apps on larger displays. You need no apps or drivers for this setup; it works immediately via plug-and-play functionality.</p>
<p>Built-in dual speakers provide audio without requiring external speakers or headphones. The sound quality handles video calls, casual entertainment, and basic gaming adequately. <strong>A 3.5mm audio jack</strong> houses headphones or external speakers when you need better audio quality. The speakers add in convenience for quick setups where carrying additional audio equipment isn’t practical.</p>
<p>At $66 for Prime members, you’re getting a full-featured portable monitor with an IPS panel, smart cover, and multi-device compatibility for 34% off. Competing portable monitors with similar specs sell for $100-150 without the included accessories.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/apple-goes-hard-on-watch-ultra-2-now-selling-at-new-all-time-low-for-black-friday-day-2-2000646455</link>

              <p>For a long, long time, the premium adventure watch market was dominated by Garmin and Suunto, but then Apple came to the party with the <em>Ultra</em> series and hasn’t looked back since. The <strong>Apple Watch Ultra 2 competes directly with flagship models from both brands</strong>&nbsp;and adds in smartphone integration that those dedicated sports watches just can’t match.</p>
<p>Apple keeps strict pricing on their own website and in Apple Stores, so it’s a complete waste of your time checking there for deals. But Amazon<a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5821/"> just dropped the Ultra 2 to $599 for Black Friday, down from $799, which marks a record low and saves you $200 on Apple’s most rugged wearable</a>. This 25% discount is the deepest cut this watch has ever seen.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5821/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Titanium Construction Survives Everything You Throw at It</h2>
<p>A <strong>49mm case made of titanium</strong> resists corrosion and impacts that would destroy aluminum watches within months of serious outdoor use. The sapphire front crystal laughs at scratches regular glass couldn’t survive, maintaining clarity through years of adventure abuse. Verification through military standard MIL-STD 810H testing shows the watch handles extreme temperatures, shocks, and conditions that exceed those most users ever encounter. <strong>Water resistance reaches a depth of 100 meters</strong>, enabling serious diving alongside swimming and water sports.</p>
<p>The 49mm size provides space for a bigger battery and a more luminous display than standard Apple Watch models have. The <strong>Always-On Retina display peaks at 3000 nits of brightness</strong>, and remains readable under direct sunlight where other screens totally wash out. The larger Digital Crown and customisable Action button work with gloves on, as well as in cold weather where touch-only controls fail.</p>



<p>Precision<strong> dual-frequency GPS</strong> delivers accuracy that serious athletes and navigators require. By utilizing both L1 and L5 satellite frequencies, the system reduces errors from signal reflection off buildings and terrain. The recorded routes of your runs better match the actual paths you run, rather than placing you directly through buildings or zigzagging all over.</p>
<p>The running features compete directly with dedicated running watches from Garmin and Coros. Advanced metrics track running form, including ground contact time, vertical oscillation, and stride length. Automatic track detection senses when you’re running on a standard track and makes adjustments accordingly. Support for custom workouts accommodates structured training, like warmups, intervals, recovery periods, and cooldowns. Training load analysis shows how your workouts are affecting your body over time to help you avoid overtraining.</p>



<p><strong>Cellular connectivity lets you leave your iPhone behind</strong> while maintaining communication capabilities. You call, text, stream music, get directions, and access apps without your phone nearby. That sense of freedom completely changes outdoor activities where carrying a phone would add bulk or create risk. Emergency SOS works anywhere with cellular coverage, providing safety during solo adventures.</p>
<p>That means <strong>battery life reaches 36 hours of normal use with the Always-On display active</strong>, extending to 72 hours of runtime in Low Power Mode for multi-day adventures. This is considerably beyond the typical Apple Watch models and closer to what dedicated adventure watches can manage. The extended battery life makes the Ultra 2 a practical choice for ultra-long hikes, ultra-marathons and multi-day trips in general.</p>
<p>Health monitoring includes tracking heart rate, the measurement of blood oxygen, ECG capability, and sleep analysis. Fall detection and crash detection provide automatic emergency alerts in case of accidents. Temperature sensing tracks overnight variations useful for cycle tracking and illness detection. All of these features run continuously without affecting battery life much.</p>
<p>At $599, you’re getting Apple’s flagship adventure watch with titanium construction and precision GPS for 25% off its standard price. Comparable Garmin watches cost between $800-1000 without the smartphone integration that Apple provides.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/apple-swallows-its-pride-macbook-air-falls-to-all-time-low-and-goes-2x-cheaper-than-pro-2000646450</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/apple-swallows-its-pride-macbook-air-falls-to-all-time-low-and-goes-2x-cheaper-than-pro.1361614/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>MacBook Pro models start at $1,599 which puts Apple’s professional laptops out of reach for many buyers who want quality computing without spending a fortune. The MacBook Air with M4 chip delivers similar performance for everyday tasks at literally half the cost of its Pro sibling.</p>
<p>Apple never discounts products on their own website or in Apple Stores, and keeps strict pricing that forces deal hunters toward third-party retailers. Amazon dropped this <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5068/">2025 MacBook Air (256GB model) to $749 for Black Friday, down from $999</a>, and marks a record low that <strong>already moved over 10,000 units this month</strong>. This 25% discount represents the kind of Apple savings you simply won’t find anywhere else.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5068/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Pro-Level Performance in Air Package</h2>
<p>Housing the most recent Apple silicon architecture,<strong> the M4 processor in the MacBook Air unleashes performance</strong> that increasingly blurs the line separating Air and Pro notebooks. The chip handles demanding tasks like video editing, photo manipulation, and software development without the thermal throttling that plagued Intel MacBooks. The<strong> unified memory architecture means the CPU and GPU can share the same 16GB pool efficiently</strong>, and sidestep the bottlenecks traditional systems experience. This level of performance handles professional workflows smoothly, which the previous generations of Air just couldn’t manage well.</p>
<p><strong>Apple Intelligence integration</strong> comes built into this M4 MacBook, bringing AI capabilities directly into the operating system. The system helps with writing tasks, image generation, and intelligent assistance without requiring cloud processing for many features. The M4’s Neural Engine processes AI workloads locally and keeps your data private while delivering fast results.</p>



<p>It features a<strong> 13.6-inch Liquid Retina Display with vibrant colors and sharp text</strong> for extended work sessions comfortable. This display features P3 wide color gamut for accurate color reproduction that photographers and designers require. This <strong>system comes with 500 nits of brightness</strong> for clear visibility in bright environments without struggling to see content. Bezels remain thin from all sides to retain maximum screen space within the compact chassis.</p>



<p>It’s a 12MP <em>Center Stage</em> camera that provides clear video calls with a<strong>utomatic framing that keeps you centered as you move</strong>. The camera tracks your position and adjusts the frame with optimal composition during video conferencing. That will work across FaceTime, Zoom, and other video applications without manually having to change anything.</p>
<p>Fanless design means <strong>this MacBook runs in complete silence, no matter the workload</strong>. The M4 chip creates such minimal heat that passive cooling takes over the thermal management without mechanical movement. You work in quiet environments such as libraries or late-night sessions without disturbing anyone with the fan noise. This silence is a real advantage compared to Pro models that immediately fire up their fans when doing resource-intensive work.</p>
<p>The <strong>battery life reaches 18 hours of video playback or about 12 hours of typical mixed use</strong>. You can go through a whole day without searching for outlets or managing power settings. This is due to the M4 chip architecture, which brings performance with power-sipping efficiency.</p>
<p>We have Apple’s latest MacBook with an M4 chip and 16GB RAM for $749, which is a straight 25% discount off the original price and makes it half as expensive as entry-level models of the MacBook Pro. For Black Friday, this sale makes current-generation Apple Silicon accessible without compromise or having to settle for older models.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/samsung-goes-nuclear-on-9100-pro-ssd-pricing-all-sizes-are-selling-for-a-new-all-time-low-2000646445</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/samsung-goes-nuclear-on-9100-pro-ssd-pricing-all-sizes-are-selling-for-a-new-all-time-low.1361611/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Storage speed dictates how fast your entire computer feels, from boot times to application launches to game loading. The<strong> Samsung 9100 PRO</strong> is the cutting edge of SSD technology and harnesses <strong>PCIe 5.0</strong> to deliver double the read speeds of previous generation drives.</p>
<p>This kind of performance transforms workflows for gamers, content creators and even professionals running AI workloads that require instant data access. Amazon slashes prices on all three capacities: <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5819/">the 1TB dropped from $199 to $134</a>, the <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5819/">2TB dropped from $279 to $219</a>, and <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5819/">the 4TB dropped from $469 to $369</a>. That means <strong>every capacity hits record low pricing</strong> that makes next-generation storage genuinely accessible.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5819/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>14,700 MB/s Read Speed Removes Every Bottleneck</h2>
<p>The resulting sequential <strong>read speed of 14,700 MB/s nearly doubles what the PCIe 4.0 drives</strong> offer and revolutionizes how fast data navigates your system. Windows boots in seconds, applications launch in real-time and large file transfers take place faster than it can process what’s going on. Games with DirectStorage support can load levels in moments rather than the loading screens that define current gaming experiences. What’s more, it actually <strong>far exceeds what most users can currently saturate</strong>&nbsp;which truly means the drive will stay relevant as software catches up to the hardware capability.</p>
<p>The <strong>sequential write speeds match the impressive read performance</strong>, handling large file creation and modifications without slowdowns like cheaper drives experience. To video editors working with 8K footage, timeline scrubbing remains responsive, while exports complete in a fraction of the time. For content creators moving huge project files around between drives, transfers finish almost instantly.</p>



<p>The PCIe 5.0 x4 interface leverages four lanes of the latest PCIe standard to achieve these speeds on a compatible motherboard. Intel 13th and 14th generation platforms, along with AMD Ryzen 7000 series, support PCIe 5.0 natively. The M.2 2280 form factor fits standard slots without adapters or special mounting requirements. Older PCIe 4.0 systems run this drive at reduced speeds, still delivering excellent performance while leaving upgrade headroom when you eventually update your platform.</p>



<p><strong>Samsung’s thermal solution is also great and</strong> manages the heat generated by high-speed operation. Included in both the controller and NAND packages are heat spreaders for dissipating thermal energy during sustained transfers. Additional thermal management is provided by systems with dedicated M.2 heatsinks or motherboard cooling solutions.</p>
<p>With this drive,<strong> AI computing workloads benefit considerably from its speed characteristics</strong>. Machine learning models load their training data much faster, and a lesser time is spent waiting for storage. Local AI inference runs more responsively when the models stream from the high-speed storage. In fact, the specifications target AI computing aside from gaming and professional workstations.</p>

              <p>Health tracking usually means strapping a bulky smartwatch onto your wrist and then remembering to charge it every few days. The <strong>Oura Ring 4 takes a completely different approach by putting comprehensive health monitoring into a sleek ring</strong> that disappears on your finger. You forget you’re wearing it within minutes which can’t be said about even the smallest smartwatches on the market.</p>
<p>Amazon dropped <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5816/">all colors and sizes to $249 for Black Friday, down from $349</a>, and marks a record low that makes this discreet fitness tracker genuinely accessible. The<strong> 29% discount applies across silver, black, gold, and stealth</strong> finishes in every ring size.</p>

<h2>Finger-Based Sensors</h2>
<p>The position of a ring on your finger gives<strong> cleaner biometric signals</strong> than is possible with wrist-based devices. The arteries in your fingers sit closer to the surface, with less interference from tendons, bones, and movement artifacts. This placement captures heart rate, heart rate variability, and blood oxygen levels with improved accuracy compared to the traditional fitness trackers.</p>
<p><strong>Sleep tracking represents the Oura Ring’s greatest strength</strong>: an analysis of your rest in granular detail that actually displays patterns invisible to casual observation. It tracks the stages of sleep, movement, temperature variation, and calculates sleep efficiency scores. When you wake up, you get a detailed picture of how well you actually slept, rather than how many hours you spent in bed.</p>



<p>It takes a variety of health metrics and puts them into one daily number that shows if your body is ready for intense activity, or if you need to recover. <strong>Sleep quality, heart rate variability, body temperature, and recent activity levels</strong> are factored in to give an estimate. A high score would suggest that you can push hard in workouts, while lower scores recommend taking it easy.</p>
<p>Temperature tracking reveals small variations in your body’s baseline that are indicative of various states of health. It is used by women for cycle tracking, where body temperature changes predictably across menstrual phases. The ring spots illness before you feel any symptoms, often showing a rise in temperature a day or two before the worst cold symptoms set in.</p>



<p><strong>Battery life reaches about a week on a single charge,</strong> and dramatically outlasts smartwatches that need daily charging. The wireless charger tops up the ring in about an hour, and you’re even able to charge while working at your desk. That extended runtime means you capture sleep data every night without needing to charge before bed.</p>
<p><strong>Activity tracking counts steps, active calories, and movement</strong> throughout the day. It doesn’t require workout logging, as the ring automatically detects activities and categorizes them accordingly. Heart rate monitoring during exercise shows intensity levels and recovery patterns. The main focus remains on daily activity rather than detailed workout metrics which suits users who want health insights without obsessive exercise tracking.</p>
<p>The <strong>Oura app presents all this data in clean visualizations</strong>, highlighting trends and actionable insights. Daily scores for sleep, readiness, and activity provide easy status checks without the need to deep-dive into charts. The app can identify patterns across weeks and months, showing how changes to lifestyle decisions impact health metrics. Personalized recommendations based on your own data help one improve scores rather than just broad, generic advice. The cost for the subscription model, after the first month is free, is $5.99 a month, which grants access to full features and historical data.</p>
<p>At $249, you’re getting premium health tracking in a form factor that traditional fitness trackers can’t match. Apple Watch and Fitbit devices cost similar amounts, but require wrist real estate and daily charging. This Black Friday pricing opens up the Oura Ring to users who want in-depth health data without the commitment to the wrist.</p>

              <p>Mini PCs pack full desktop functionality into compact cases that disappear behind monitors or tuck into tight spaces where traditional towers won’t fit. The Mac Mini made this form factor popular, but Apple charges premium prices that put compact computing out of reach for budget-conscious buyers.</p>
<p>The <strong>Kamrui GK3 Plus</strong> provides a similar set of everyday capabilities at a fraction of the cost and performs well at web browsing, office work, streaming and even light photo editing. Amazon dropped <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3768/">the 16GB/512GB model to $189 for Black Friday, and applying the 10% promo code gets it down to $170 from the usual $229</a>&nbsp;which is a record low that makes desktop computing absurdly affordable.</p>

<h2>Intel N95 Processor Handles Daily Tasks With Ease</h2>
<p>The 12th generation <strong>Intel Alder Lake N95 processor</strong> runs at a base frequency of 1.7GHz and boosts up to 3.4GHz when tasks require extra power. Four cores take care of multitasking scenarios like running a browser with multiple tabs while streaming music and working in documents. This chip delivers 35% better CPU performance and 78% improved graphics compared to older N100 and N5105 processors found in competing budget mini PCs.</p>
<p>The integrated Intel UHD Graphics runs 4K video playback, casual photo editing and general desktop work with ease. You will not be editing 4K video timelines or playing demanding games, but everyday computing feels responsive and capable. The graphics output supports three displays simultaneously through dual HDMI ports and a VGA connection.</p>



<p>This 16GB of DDR4 RAM is enough to supply modern computing without slowdowns that plague systems with less capacity. You keep dozens of browser tabs open, run multiple applications side by side, and jump between tasks without waiting for content to reload. This amount of memory matches what many premium laptops include and is well above what budget systems often offer. You notice the difference immediately in daily use, where 8GB systems start to struggle with basic multitasking.</p>
<p>The 512GB M.2 SSD stores your operating system and files on fast solid-state storage. Boot times measure in seconds rather than minutes, and applications launch quickly without the delays hard drives cause. <strong>Storage expands through an additional 2.5-inch drive bay that accepts SSDs up to 2TB</strong>.</p>



<p>It’s compact,<strong> measuring only 5.1 by 5.1 by 1.96 inches</strong> and it is small enough to mount behind a monitor via an included VESA bracket. This mounting option creates a pseudo all-in-one setup that keeps your desk clean and hides the computer from view. The size makes it perfect for entertainment centers where it connects to TVs for streaming without the bulk of a traditional PC. You escape the limited app selection of smart TVs by running a full Windows installation with access to any streaming service or application.</p>
<p>Connectivity includes Gigabit Ethernet for fast wired networking and dual-band WiFi for wireless flexibility. Bluetooth 4.2 interfaces connect wireless peripherals like keyboards, mice, and headphones. The port selection has USB connections for external devices and storage in addition to the video outputs. This connectivity handles typical home and office setups without requiring adapters or hubs.</p>
<p><strong>Windows is ready to go, right out of the box</strong>.</p>
<p>At $170 with the promo code, you’re getting a complete desktop computer with 16GB RAM and 512GB SSD for less than most people spend on accessories. Performance won’t be of the same caliber as Apple Silicon, but general computing tasks run smoothly without the premium price tag.</p>

              <p>Nintendo has dominated portable gaming with the Switch 2, but Sony finally offers a compelling alternative for PlayStation owners who want their games on the go. The company built an empire around the PS5 as a living room powerhouse and the <strong>PS Portal extends that experience beyond the couch and into your hands</strong>.</p>
<p>This device <strong>streams your entire PS5 library to a beautiful 8-inch screen</strong>, and lets you play God of War or Spider-Man anywhere in your home or via cloud gaming on the move. Amazon <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5815/">dropped it to $179 for Black Friday, down from $199</a>. That’s a record low, one which already moved over 8,000 units and counting.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5815/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>PS5 Games to Your Hands</h2>
<p>The <strong>full HD 1080p display stretches across 8 inches of screen</strong> real estate, creating an immersive portable gaming experience. You see game details clearly with vibrant colors and sharp text, making even busy action sequences easy to keep track of. Screen brightness handles a wide range of lighting conditions, from dimly lit bedrooms to bright living rooms.</p>
<p>The<strong> 60fps capability</strong> ensures smooth gameplay that matches what you experience on your TV. Frame rates stay locked during intense action sequences, maintaining the responsive feel that PS5 games deliver on the console itself. The visual quality impresses given the streaming nature of the device, with minimal compression artifacts during stable WiFi connections.</p>



<p><em>Remote Play</em> <strong>connects directly to your PS5 console over WiFi</strong>, and streams games installed on your system to the portable device. You play your whole digital and disc library without buying games a second time or waiting for separate downloads. The PS5 does all the processing while the Portal displays the video output and transmits your controller inputs back. The upside of this is that you get complete PS5 graphics instead of downgraded portable versions.</p>
<p>The <strong>cloud streaming through Playstation Plus Premium</strong> unlocks gaming without needing your PS5 powered on: you access hundreds of titles from the Game Catalog and Classics Catalog streamed directly to the device. Select PS5 games from your digital library stream sans downloads, affording instant access to big titles wherever decent internet is found.</p>



<p>The<strong> features of the DualSense controller integrate</strong> directly into the Portal’s design: haptic feedback and adaptive triggers are built into the grips. You feel immersive sensations, from terrain textures to weapon recoil, the same as the standard PS5 controller. A familiar button layout means PlayStation players don’t need an adjustment period. The ergonomic design spreads the weight comfortably during long play sessions.</p>
<p>Tempest 3D AudioTech provides for spatial sound through the headphone jack or wirelessly via Playstation Link compatible devices. You really hear enemies coming from specific directions and environmental audio placed precisely in three-dimensional space. This audio quality adds a layer of immersion that most portable gaming devices lack. The experience approaches what you’d get through a proper home theater setup, compressed into a personal audio bubble.</p>
<p><strong>Battery life reaches several hours</strong> of continuous play and sees you through extended gaming sessions without the need for a charge. USB-C charging makes use of standard cables you already own, ensuring that topping up from portable batteries or wall chargers is a breeze. The device goes into sleep mode fast when you pause a game to conserve battery life for when you return.</p>
<p>At $179, you’re getting a premium portable streaming device with DualSense features and an 8-inch display for 10% off. The Switch 2 costs significantly more while running native games at lower graphical fidelity than streamed PS5 titles.</p>

              <p>Amazon loves to push its own brands during Black Friday, and the Echo Dot always gets the deepest cuts. By selling these smart speakers at razor-thin margins-or even at a loss-Amazons ensures Alexa finds her way into as many American homes as possible. The strategy works brilliantly for the company, but it also gives shoppers some incredible deals. The <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4514/">newest Echo Dot now drops from $49 to just $31</a> which is a record low price found only on Amazon.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4514/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>The Best Sounding Echo Dot Ever Made</h2>
<p>Amazon says this is the <strong>best-sounding Echo Dot they’ve ever made</strong>, and the difference is actually appreciable: clearer vocals, deeper bass, and altogether punchier sound well above its weight class. Music fills a bedroom or office surprisingly well for something this small. Previous Echo Dot generations sounded thin and tinny in comparison. The audio upgrade alone justifies replacing older models you might have scattered around the house.</p>



<p><strong>Alexa integration</strong> makes this speaker a genuinely useful daily assistant: ask for the weather while you get dressed, set timers while you cook, or get quick answers to random questions throughout the day. The voice recognition works reliably from across the room, even with music playing. You can even tap the top to snooze your morning alarm when you need a few extra minutes.</p>
<p>Music streaming connects to all of the services you probably already use. <strong>Amazon Music, Apple Music, Spotify, among others, all work seamlessly through voice commands</strong>. Bluetooth connectivity lets you stream from any device when you want manual control. You can fill your entire home with synchronized music by pairing multiple Echo devices in different rooms. The ecosystem grows naturally as you add more speakers over time.</p>
<p>Smart home control makes the Echo Dot a<strong> central hub for any connected device</strong>: lights, thermostats, plugs, and many more accessories follow your every simple command. With its built-in motion sensor, routines can be automatically invoked as soon as you turn up in a room. The indoor temperature sensor allows you to create comfort-based automation, where you start the fan once it gets too hot.</p>



<p>Privacy controls certainly help mitigate these concerns about always-listening devices. The dedicated microphone off button physically disconnects the mics when you need guaranteed privacy. Amazon has built layers of protection into the system, stating explicitly that they do not sell your personal information. You can review and delete voice recordings at any time through the Alexa app, a big improvement over previous models in terms of data transparency.</p>
<p>Pairing options extend the functionality well beyond basic speaker duties. Pair with Fire TV devices for a home theater-like audio experience, link with compatible Eero mesh systems to extend Wi-Fi coverage throughout the house, and create speaker groups that play synchronized audio across multiple rooms. The Echo Dot works great on its own but really shines as part of a larger system.</p>
<p>At $31, the Echo Dot introduces smart home capability for a near-disposable price. In one small package, you’re getting better audio quality, Alexa integration, smart home control, and integrated sensors. This Black Friday deal brings the newest model to its lowest recorded price.</p>
