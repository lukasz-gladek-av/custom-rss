              <p>Your living room deserves smart lighting that doesn’t drain your wallet. Smart floor lamps have become incredibly popular for transforming spaces with dynamic colors and voice control but the price tags often make people think twice. Not anymore. Right now, the <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4546/">Govee RGBIC floor lamp has dropped to just $64 on Amazon, down from its usual $99 price</a>. This Prime Big Deal Days offer <strong>marks an all-time low</strong> for one of the most popular smart lamps on the market.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4546/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<p>This is not another mood-decorating, color-changing lamp: The Govee floor lamp is 136cm high and<strong> produces 1000 lumens of light which means it genuinely functions as actual light for your room</strong> (rather than mood decoration). At that level of brightness, it places it on a par with standard floor lamps so you can employ it for reading, working or ambient room light when it’s day, then shift over to bright color modes when night falls.</p>
<h2>What Makes This Smart Lamp Worth Your Money</h2>
<p>The RGBIC tech (that IC means <em>Independent Control</em>) distinguishes this lamp from less expensive ones: <strong>Each of the light strip segments is capable of showing disparate colors at the same time</strong>&nbsp;which lets you have flowing rainbow effects or gradients or multi-color schemes that plain RGB lamps aren’t up for. At your fingertips, <strong>you’re looking at 16 million different available colors and 58 dynamic built-in scenes</strong> named Cheerful, Romantic, and the like. Want your lamp pulsing red and orange, like a campfire? Done. Want a chilly blue-to-purple gradient for a late gaming marathon? Easy. The range goes deep enough that you’ll be able to fine-tune your lamp with holiday decorations or a party theme or just your mood of the moment without ever using the same look twice.</p>



<p>Voice command with Alexa or Google Home allows you never to have to rummage for your phone. Simply ask your smart speaker to turn the lamp on, change the hue, or reduce the brightness while cooking, working, or already settled on the sofa. The Govee Home app (installable through QR code on the box) adds additional control features with scheduling, so your lamp automatically wakes you gently with morning hues or unwinds with warm hues at bedtime. The app interface makes it simple to create custom scenes, allowing you to set specific hues for varying segments of a scene and then save your favorite sets for instant recall.</p>
<p>With sync mode,<strong> this light springs to life at parties, movie nights, or when playing video games</strong>. Inner microphones detect sound in the room and translate it into dynamic, real-time changes in brightness. Thump-heavy tunes create pulsing results, dialogues stay gentle, and action scenes erupt with corresponding changes in color. This dynamic lighting delivers real immersion for entertainment without cluttered setup.</p>
<p>The physical build makes this lamp suitable for real homes: Aluminum construction makes it firm (non-wobbling, non-tipping) yet light enough for simple transport from one room to another. Sections on the base fasten immediately without tools. At 136cm tall, it comfortably inhabits a corner, behind a sofa or next to a desk without overwhelming your space.</p>
<p>Stock sells out fast on Prime Big Deal Days, so this all-time-low pricing won’t last indefinitely.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[The 22,000 Pa Roborock With Mop Delivers Luxury Cleaning Power, Now at Its Lowest Price for Prime Members.]]></title>
            <link>https://kotaku.com/the-22000-pa-roborock-with-mop-delivers-luxury-cleaning-power-now-at-its-lowest-price-for-prime-members-2000632151</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/the-22-000-pa-roborock-with-mop-delivers-luxury-cleaning-power-now-at-its-lowest-price-for-prime-members.1318090/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Roborock launched the Saros 10R in June 2025 and introduced its latest flagship generation that redefines what premium robot vacuums can achieve. This is <strong>the most advanced model in Roborock’s entire lineup</strong>, and it delivers power and capabilities that dwarf every other robot vacuum currently sold on Amazon.</p>
<p>Now, for Prime Big Deal Days, this <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4545/">technological marvel has dropped to a new record low of $1,199, down from its usual $1,599</a>. The reason people invest in premium robot vacuums like this is simple: they want their <strong>floors genuinely clean</strong> without lifting a finger, and cheaper models simply can’t deliver the thoroughness, intelligence, or convenience that justify the automation.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4545/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>22,000 Pa Suction Power Eradicates Dirt on Entire Surfaces</h2>
<p>Conventional robot vacuums are 3.8 to 4 inches high due to the necessity for a raised LDS (<em>Laser Distance Sensor</em>) tower on top for mapping. Roborock Saros 10R features the StarSight Autonomous System 2.0 which eliminates the extending sensor unit and <strong>reduces the profile to a mere 3.14 inches high</strong>. The vacuum slides under beds, sofas, cabinets and coffee tables that stand in the way of chunkier rivals.</p>
<p>The 3D sensing capabilities accurately map rooms even under spindly-legged furniture and drop-down cabinets with the VertiBeam Lateral Obstacle Avoidance system avoiding obstructions such as cables and poly-legged furniture legs without getting stuck. The advanced algorithms identify and respond to 108 different types of obstructions, so the vacuum cleans your whole home without incessant supervision or rescue interventions.</p>



<p>The <strong>HyperForce suction system produces 22,000 pascals of vacuum pressure</strong> which is about double/triple what mid-range robot vacuums deliver. This brute strength removes ground-in dirt from carpet fibers, draws out debris from grout gaps between tiles, and sucks up fine dust particles from hardwood left behind by weaker robots. The Zero-Tangling DuoDivide main brush features a <strong>dual-sided design that keeps hair from tangling around the roller</strong>, automatically ejecting and depositing long hair and pet fur directly into the dustbin. The FlexiArm Riser side brush <strong>extends automatically when it senses corners and edging</strong>, sweeping out debris from baseboards and cramped corners that round robots almost universally ignore.</p>



<p>The first-of-its-type AdaptiLift Chassis adjusts the height of the robot dynamically, navigating through obstructions up to 4 cm high like door thresholds, area rug corners, and U-shaped chair leg furnishings that would cause lighter robots to stall. As soon as it senses carpet, <strong>the two rotating cleaning mops and their mounting bracket automatically lift up</strong> so you don’t wet your carpets, then lower when returning to hard floors.</p>
<p>The multifunctional dock 4.0 handles ten different maintenance tasks autonomously: It washes mops with 176-degree Fahrenheit hot water, dries them with 131-degree hot air to prevent mildew, <strong>empties the robot’s dustbin automatically with 60 days of capacity</strong>, refills the water tank, dispenses cleaning solution, and even cleans itself with hot water. The dock recharges the robot in 2.5 hours, and when it detects heavily soiled areas during cleaning, it triggers automatic re-wash and re-mop cycles for deep cleaning.</p>
<p>At $1,199 during Prime Big Deal Days, the Saros 10R costs less than several mid-range variants but delivers flagship performance for which full automation is justified.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/this-power-station-1500w-7-outlets-is-going-for-pennies-as-amazon-drops-the-price-for-a-second-time-2000632145</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>This weekend, Amazon dropped the <strong>Jackery Explorer 1000 (v2)</strong> to $429 for early <em>Prime Big Deal Days</em> access. Now the retailer has taken things even further by lowering the displayed price to $399, <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3722/">plus an additional 10% off at checkout for eligible buyers, bringing the final cost down to potentially $359 (down from $799)</a>. This is an absolute record low price for this power station, and here’s what makes it remarkable: <strong>no competitor offering a 1500W portable power station has ever come close to this pricing</strong>.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3722/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<p>You’re<strong> looking at half off the usual $799 retail price</strong> on a product that solves one of the most frustrating problems for campers, RV owners and anyone preparing for emergencies. Running out of power during outdoor adventures or losing electricity during storms creates genuine hardship, and the Jackery Explorer 1000 provides enough capacity and output to keep essential devices running for extended periods.</p>
<h2>Days of Power, Not Hours</h2>
<p>The 1070 watt-hour capacity provides robust energy storage translating to real-world usage most users are familiar with. You’ll be able to <strong>charge a laptop around 10 times, run a mini-fridge for approximately 15 hours</strong>, support LED lights for a few days or run a CPAP unit for a number of evenings. The LiFePO4 battery chemistry is a step up from lithium-ion batteries employed for lower-end power stations: LiFePO4 batteries last for approximately 4,000 charge cycles until capacity dips at 80%, for reference, standard lithium-ion batteries last for around 500 to 1,000 cycles at the 80% level.</p>
<p>The majority of portable power stations have a peak output of between 300W and 500W which makes for charging small devices like cell phones or a mini portable fan at once. The <strong>1500W of continuous output with a 3000W surge delivers</strong> sufficient power for actual household devices like microwaves, electric kettles, power tools, or a small air conditioner unit. The surge amount addresses the starting burst of power when starting motors which is relevant for devices like refrigerators that consume several multiples of their-rated wattage for a number of seconds at starting time. The unit contains <strong>everyday AC outlets</strong> which accept typical three-prong plugs, and a<strong> 100W USB-C Power Delivery outlet</strong> for quick charging a laptop or tablet without bulky AC adapters.</p>



<p>The fast charging for one hour <strong>allows you to go from zero to full battery in 60 minutes</strong> via a common wall outlet which is extremely fast for a battery of this size. Most rival power stations need 6-8 hours for a full recharge. This quick turnaround is priceless on multi-day camping trips when you may have shore power available for a few hours here or there, or when there are rolling blackouts when you have a quick top-off between outages. The unit also has solar charging capabilities with optional solar panels, allowing you to have power on tap indefinitely off-grid when you harness energy from the sun during the day.</p>
<p>The Jackery Explorer 1000 v2 currently the <strong>highest-rated best-seller on Amazon for generators for outdoors</strong>, with over 4,000 units sold this month alone and a 4.6-star overall rating out of nearly 3,000 reviews. At $359 using the checkout discount on Prime Big Deal Days, you pay less than some 500Wh power centers with half the capacity and a much lower lifespan.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[This MacBook Air (M4, 256GB, 16GB RAM), Now Costs Half the Price of a Pro, Amazon Rushes to Clear Out Space]]></title>
            <link>https://kotaku.com/this-macbook-air-m4-256gb-16gb-ram-now-costs-half-the-price-of-a-pro-amazon-rushes-to-clear-out-space-2000632140</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/this-macbook-air-m4-256gb-16gb-ram-now-costs-half-the-price-of-a-pro-amazon-rushes-to-clear-out-space.1318066/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>MacBook Air models dominate Apple’s laptop sales because they handle everyday computing needs for the vast majority of users (without the complexity or cost of Pro models). The catch has always been the price: You need to budget at least $1,000 for the standard configuration and upgrades can quickly push you toward $1,500, the territory where MacBook Pro models begin.</p>
<p>For <em>Prime Big Deal Days</em>, Amazon has essentially eliminated its entire profit margin on the best-selling configuration, <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3761/">bringing the 2025 MacBook Air 13-inch with M4 chip down to $799 from its usual $999</a>. This represents the lowest price ever for the 2025 model <strong>with 256GB storage and 16GB unified memory</strong>.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3761/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>M4 Chip Designed for Apple Intelligence</h2>
<p>The M4 chip is Apple’s latest silicon design which is <strong>custom-built for handling Apple Intelligence features</strong> which require intensive processing for on-device AI calculations. That means features like sophisticated editing of photos, real-time translation, voice transcription, and intelligent writing assistant are executed locally on your laptop rather than being sent off to cloud servers.</p>
<p>The performance benefit extends beyond AI features: The M4 handles dozens of web tabs, many productivity applications, video calling and background applications without a hitch or fan functioning. Because it is fanless, the <strong>MacBook Air stays silent for any amount of intensive usage</strong>&nbsp;which is not possible for regular Intel-based laptops which require active heat management when under load.</p>



<p>Apple’s unified memory architecture pools RAM across the CPU, the GPU, and the Neural Engine, so data moves between disparate processing units without the performance penalty that individual pools of memory cause in older computer architectures. The 16GB setup affords sufficient headroom for professional uses like photo editing in Final Cut Pro, video editing or virtual machines. This is important because earlier versions of the MacBook Air had 8GB, which meant that users had to constantly juggle what apps they had open.</p>



<p>The <strong>13.6-inch Liquid Retina display uses IPS LCD tech with a resolution of 2560 pixels by 1664 pixels</strong>. The Liquid Retina display includes the P3 wide color gamut, a brightness of 500 nits and remains legible outdoors under direct sunlight when cheaper laptop screens dim down and become unreadable. True Tone tech automatically changes colour temperature based on ambient illumination for less eye strain when working for long periods at a time.</p>
<p>The 12MP Center Stage camera at last elevates MacBook video call quality. <strong>Center Stage utilizes machine learning when you’re on the go</strong>, automatically framing you by zooming and panning to create the ideal video call composition. This gives you a more professional appearance when participating in online Zoom conferences and eliminates the bothersome need for you to repeatedly shift your position or angle to remain visible on camera.</p>
<p>This laptop sells for $799 on Prime Big Deal Days, which places the 2025 MacBook Air M4 on equal terms truly with mid-range Windows notebooks but with Apple’s superior build quality, battery life, and ecosystem integration.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>October was going to be a special month. For the first time since <em>Shovel Knight</em> came out over a decade ago, Yacht Club Games was going to release a new game that had nothing to do with its hit 8-bit platformer. It’s a <em>Link’s Awakening</em>-sized adventure <a href="https://kotaku.com/shovel-knight-mina-the-hollower-zelda-castlevania-game-1848463038">called <em>Mina the Hollower</em></a>. Unfortunately, it also just got indefinitely delayed.</p> <p>“This week, our team made a tough decision: we decided to delay <em>Mina the Hollower</em>,” the studio wrote in <a href="https://www.yachtclubgames.com/blog/delay-extravaganza-ii-the-tail-continues/">a new blog post on Monday</a>. “The entire crew has been working tirelessly day and night to finish development for release on Oct 31st, but we’re just not quite there yet.&nbsp; This isn’t a major delay, it’s just a stretch of time to apply some final polish and balancing to make the game truly shine.”</p>

 <p>Unlike its 2D side-scrolling predecessor,<em> Mina the Hollower</em> is a top-down action game that focuses a bit more on puzzles and combat. Think <em>Castlevania</em> if it fell on the ground with a <em>Zelda</em>-inspired interconnected map. It has all the signs of becoming another clever, charming retro homage if Yacht Club can deliver. Apparently, it still needs more time to cook. There’s no new release date yet, but that doesn’t mean it’s necessarily far away from finally coming out.</p>

 <p>“We don’t want to announce another release date until it’s submitted to platforms, so please hang tight as we reach the finish line,” Yacht Club wrote today. “The game is&nbsp;<i>so</i> close to being done- we’re playing it from start to finish every day.” In the meantime, the developers say they’re working on finalizing design, art, sound, game balance, localization, and QA.</p> <p><em>Mina the Hollower</em> is the third notable game <a href="https://kotaku.com/every-game-release-october-2025-pokemon-battlefield-ninja-gaiden-2000630373">to drop out of the busy October release calendar lineup</a>. Roguelike dungeon game <em>Moonlighter 2 </em>moved to November and <i>Kingmakers </i>is missing its Early Access date this week with no new date announced yet. <em>Mina the Hollower</em> is the one I was looking forward to most, however. I’d love to be spending my end-of-year travel season cozied up to my Switch like it’s 1998 again and the Game Boy Color just came out. We’ll see if it still ends up arriving in time for the holiday.</p>
                          </div></div><br/><br/>https://kotaku.com/shovel-knight-sequel-mina-hollower-delay-yacht-club-2000632148]]></content:encoded>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/gopro-is-going-wild-for-prime-day-the-hero13-black-is-practically-being-given-away-on-amazon-2000632012</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/gopro-is-going-wild-for-prime-day-the-hero13-black-is-practically-being-given-away-on-amazon.1318015/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><strong>GoPro almost never puts its cameras on sale</strong>. Outside of a handful of major shopping events each year, and exclusively through Amazon, you’re paying full price. That’s why <em>Prime Big Deal Days</em> and Black Friday are the only real opportunities to snag a deal on their latest gear. Right now, <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4525/">the HERO13 Black bundle (including two batteries) is down to $399 from its usual $499, and this is an all-time low for the newest model</a>. If you’ve been waiting to document your ski trips, capture your kids’ soccer games from unique angles, mount a camera on your mountain bike for trail footage or simply record your travels in stunning quality that your phone can’t match, this is your moment.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4525/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<p>This package comes complete with goodies that truly make a difference: You receive <strong>two Enduro batteries</strong>, which is a big deal because action camera batteries have a short life when you’re recording in chilly weather or capturing high-def video. Enduro batteries are also designed to hold up better when it’s cold outside and have a longer overall life, <strong>giving you up to 2.5 hours of solid 5.3K recording per battery pack</strong>.</p>
<p>Another welcome innovation is t<strong>he waterproof shutter remote</strong> which allows you to initiate recording or stop recording from a distance of up to 196 feet away. This allows you to affix the GoPro HERO 13 Black camera on your helmet, your ride or a tripod and operate it without awkwardly pressing the small buttons on the camera which is extremely handy when your hands are gloved or the camera is mounted somewhere out of easy reach.</p>



<h2>Film-Like Experience That Accommodates Your Trek</h2>
<p>The <strong>HERO13 Black captures at 5.3K resolution</strong> which provides 91% more information than regular 4K and a whopping 665% more resolution than 1080p. That extra resolution provides serious leeway in post-editing. Crop-in on your shots, firm up shaky frames or punch-in on details without sacrificing quality. The GoPro Quik app even allows you to <strong>pull 24.7-megapixel still images straight out of your 5.3K video</strong>&nbsp;so you never have a bad photo because you happened to be recording video rather than pics.</p>
<p>One of the coolest capabilities is <strong>Burst Slo-Mo which takes action at 13 times normal speed</strong>. Just think about being able to capture a skate trick, a breaking wave, or a bike jump with all the little details witnessed in silky smooth slow motion. And you <strong>can capture 4x slow motion at the full 5.3K resolution</strong>&nbsp;which creates extremely detailed slo-mo video that freezes movements and moments your eye might otherwise miss.</p>



<p>The GoPro HERO13 Black includes native support for HB-Series Lenses that are automatically switched when you put them on the camera. The Ultra Wide Lens Mod is perfect for POV shots when you need to see all that’s in front of you, from ski slopes to surf sessions. The Macro Lens Mod places you very close to the subject for close-ups of small objects, details, or animals. Neutral Density filters enable you to naturally blur fast-paced scenes for motion blur and exposure control for sunny scenes, adding a cinematic effect to your clips.</p>
<p>Designed to withstand the toughest environments, the <strong>HERO13 Black is water-resistant up to 33 feet without the need for extra housing</strong>. Water-repellent lens cover minimizes lens flare, giving you clear shots even when wet.</p>
<p>For that price, getting the complete bundle with two batteries is a steal.</p>

              <p>There’s a special battle in <a href="https://kotaku.com/final-fantasy-tactics-remaster-review-ivalice-chronicles-2000628040"><em>Final Fantasy Tactic</em>s</a> that’s been punishing unsuspecting players for generations. Thanks to <em>The Ivalice Chronicles</em> remaster, fresh recruits can witness the joy and terror of randomly getting jumped by 11 monks in one of the strategy RPG’s lesser-known endgame challenges.</p> <p>Every spot on the map in <em>Final Fantasy Tactics</em> comes with an <a href="https://kotaku.com/final-fantasy-tactics-tips-guide-ivalice-remaster-jobs-2000630228">array of random encounters</a> the game can pull from depending on which side you enter from and how far along you are in the story. Once you hit Chapter 4, the game’s “rare” random encounters become accessible. These special battles are weird, hard, and memorable. None more so than the 11-Monk brawl on Grogh Heights (known in the original PS1 version as Grog Hill). They hit hard and have great range thanks to the Monk’s versatile Martial Arts abilities. God help you if you accidentally drop into the battle while trying to train your squad up on weaker jobs they don’t have many abilities for.</p>

   <p>Fans on the <em>Final Fantasy Tactics</em> subreddit have been posting about these Monks for years. Every so often, someone new to the game takes a photo, uploads it in a thread, and writes something to the effect of “WTF?” Community hero Kronikle has been cataloging every instance and posting each of them under every new thread. This happened <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/finalfantasytactics/comments/1nyutyr/anyone_seen_a_random_battle_like_this_lol/">again over the weekend</a>.</p>

 <p>“Homie really pulled up with the receipts,” wrote one fan in response. “Dude replies this every time and adds to it. It’s my most favorite thing ever on this subreddit,” wrote another. A third chimed in, “gotta respect the dedication.”</p>

   <p>While the Monks are arguably the game’s most absurd rare battle, there’s close to <a href="https://gamefaqs.gamespot.com/boards/197339-final-fantasy-tactics/41329250">a dozen others</a> scattered across the map, each with a chance of occurring when you walk to that specific point from the right direction. A small army of Calculators can spawn at Lenalia Plateau, Yuguo Woods can spawn seven Samurai, and Germinas Peak can spawn a group of Chemists and Orators with powerful guns worth stealing. Certain rare monsters like Tiamats can only spawn in the Bariaus Valley rare battle.</p> <p>Some players seek these fights out in order to farm abilities off the crystals the enemies drop. Others just like the added challenge and variety. Most story battles in <em>Final Fantasy Tactics</em> only draw from a very limited pool of Jobs, making the rare battles extra fun. Fortunately, with the Enhanced mode’s ability to retry and flee battles, you’ll never have to worry about seeing hours of progress get wiped out this way.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><i><span>Call of Duty: Black Ops 7</span></i><span> is </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/call-of-duty-cod-black-ops-blops7-beta-doors-ttk-2000632082"><span>holding an online beta test</span></a><span> until October 8, so fans can play the online modes before the full game launches on November 14. Some players are having matchmaking issues, but I suppose identifying such issues is the whole point of betas, so that’s not too surprising. What is surprising, however, is that players were reporting earlier that </span><i><span>Black Ops 7</span></i><span>’s in-game text chat was censoring the name of another shooter launching soon. No, it’s not direct competitor </span><i><span>Battlefield 6</span></i><span>. It’s </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/arc-raiders-embark-pvpve-extraction-division-dmz-2000631540"><i><span>Arc Raiders</span></i></a><span>, the upcoming extraction shooter from Embark Studios.</span></p> <p><span>Players were reporting earlier today (thanks, </span><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-censor-arc-raiders"><i><span>Eurogamer</span></i></a><span>) that if you sent “Arc Raiders”</span> <span>in the </span><i><span>Black Ops 7</span></i><span> beta’s text chat, the message that would actually pop up would just be a series of asterisks. According to those who tested it, the words “Arc” and “Raiders,” individually, seemed to get through the moderation system just fine. It was only when they were put together in that order that a switch flipped. </span><i><span>Battlefield 6</span></i><span>, arguably </span><i><span>Call of Duty</span></i><span>’s biggest competitor, didn’t seem to be affected, even after taking </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/new-battlefield-6-trailer-direct-attack-against-call-of-duty-celeb-trailer-skins-ea-2000629910"><span>shots at the military shooter in a recent ad</span></a><span>.</span></p>

   <p><span>However, </span><i><span>Kotaku </span></i><span>has verified that this has since been patched out. I downloaded the beta myself. That was 52GB installed on my scalding hot gamer laptop just to type another game’s name into chat to see what happened.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><i><span>Arc Raiders</span></i><span> isn’t the type of game I would have expected Activision to view as a competitor or threat to </span><i><span>Call of Duty</span></i><span>. It’s a science fiction extraction shooter in which, sure, you point and shoot at things, so maybe that was enough in someone’s eyes at Activision? I’m now curious what other games could be crossed out in </span><i><span>Black Ops 7</span></i><span>’s backend. Embark Studios also made another shooter, </span><i><span>The Finals</span></i><span>, so it’s not like it’s a bright-eyed newcomer to making video games, but it’s still an odd target for Activision to hone in on. They’re not the only ones, as </span><i><span>Battlefield </span></i><span>publisher EA was also </span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ArcRaiders/comments/1mhrrhd/ea_is_censoring_arc_raiders_in_their_chats/"><span>censoring the game’s name in its apps</span></a><span>. What are y’all so scared of? Could it be an error? We’ve reached out to Activision and Embark Studios about the situation and will update this story if we hear back.</span></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Following a whiplash-inducing 50-percent price hike for Game Pass Ultimate, Game Pass and <a href="https://kotaku.com/xbox-game-pass-cancel-controversy-console-pc-2000631061">the Xbox brand overall are in a funky place</a>. That nauseating price increase is likely the loudest adjustment being made to the once-decent Game Pass subscription service, but it’s far from the only one. Old tiers have been overhauled and renamed, with tighter restrictions on when you can access certain games and how many of them you’ll have access to, and the <a href="https://kotaku.com/black-ops-7-game-pass-call-duty-points-discount-changes-2000631483">discounts and deals subscribers once enjoyed</a> are but ash scattered to the wind.</p> <p><b>Read More:</b> <a href="https://kotaku.com/xbox-game-pass-cancel-controversy-console-pc-2000631061">The Enshittification Of Game Pass Is Here</a></p> <p>While the Ultimate plan now has a few more features than it once did, the sting of paying 50 percent extra has caused serious damage to the Xbox brand, with <a href="https://kotaku.com/xbox-game-pass-price-lina-khan-ftc-microsoft-activision-merger-2000631611">progressive lawmakers saying “told ya so</a>” after Microsoft gobbled up a bunch of studios and publishers. This is all going down while <a href="https://kotaku.com/xbox-game-pass-streaming-free-ad-supported-report-price-increase-2000631520">rumors of an ad-supported version of Xbox Game Streaming</a> are swimming around. That last point shouldn’t be surprising as <a href="https://kotaku.com/xbox-ad-call-of-duty-modern-warfare-3-game-pass-1850987502">Xbox consoles have routinely been home to various ads</a> <a href="https://youtu.be/4i1LCVSdD7k?t=277">taking up your full screen</a> <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/consoles/comments/1nw5so9/xbox_consoles_are_now_getting_a_fullscreen_xbox/">on boot</a>.</p>

 <p>As is customary for the first quarter of the 21st century, <a href="https://craphound.com/category/enshittification/">we’re all quoting comrade Doctorow</a> in response to these wild changes. But in case you’re looking to shrug off that late-stage-capitalism ennui with some gaming on Xbox, let’s break down what Game Pass now costs, and how you can still get it for pre-hike prices, for now.</p>

 <h2>How much does Game Pass cost now?</h2> <p>Following last week’s changes, Xbox Game Pass presently offers three tiers:</p> <ul> <li aria-level="1">Essential ($10/month)</li> <li aria-level="1">Premium ($15/month)</li> <li aria-level="1">Ultimate ($30/month)</li> </ul> <p>All of these tiers let you play online multiplayer on Xbox, though <b>the number of games available and when you get access to them varies</b>. Essential and Premium don’t offer day-one access for new Xbox games. Premium, however, lets you play recently released Xbox titles “within 12 months of launch.” Ultimate (which will run you a ridiculous $360/year if you hang on to your sub all year) grants you the most games with the fastest access: Day-one availability on first- and third-party games, plus all the games in EA Play and Ubisoft+ Classics.</p>

 <p>You can <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/xbox-game-pass#join">check out the full details on Xbox’s site</a>, but it’s clear that Game Pass isn’t only more expensive than it once was, it’s also become far more complicated than just throwing a modest sum of money at Microsoft per month to be sure you can play the new <i>Gears</i> or <i>COD</i> at launch.</p>

 <p><b>Read More:</b> <a href="https://kotaku.com/gamestop-game-pass-price-xbox-ally-leak-marvel-rivals-cross-platform-2000631038">GameStop Hits Back At Massive Xbox Game Pass Price Hike</a></p> <p><b>There’s also a PC-only plan for $16.49/month</b> which promises day-one availability of Xbox-published games, as well as some third-party ones. It also includes EA Play.</p>

 <h2>Hang on to Game Pass for Console if ya got it</h2> <p>There’s a select group of Game Pass subscribers who will be happy to know they just dodged a bullet (for now, anyway). As <a href="https://www.polygon.com/xbox-game-pass-console-grandfather-accounts/">confirmed by our comrades over at <i>Polygon</i></a>, if you are presently subscribed to the now-phased-out Game Pass for Console and automatic payment is still set up and functioning, you will be grandfathered in with all of the benefits of the old subscription.</p>

 <p>Should you cancel payments, however, you’ll lose access to that retired plan and will need to choose among the three poison pills of a service Microsoft is selling you. Checking which plan you have is as simple as logging in to Game Pass’ website, clicking on “My Microsoft Account” and checking what active subscriptions you currently have.</p> <h2>GameStop is still selling subs at the older prices (for now)</h2> <p>In an unlikely turn of events, GameStop of all companies has lol’d at Xbox by continuing to sell Ultimate subscriptions for just $20/month. It may be worth checking out other retailers, probably in brick and mortar stores, to see if you can snag a subscription card for a cheaper price as well.</p> <h2>Discounts got the ax. Now it’s all about “Rewards”</h2> <p>One of the cooler things about the Game Pass of Old™ was that you’d regularly get access to exclusive discounts on games and DLC. That’s obviously no longer in Microsoft’s interests to offer you as <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/microsoft-confirms-it-scrapped-the-xbox-game-pass-discount-on-all-games-and-dlc-purchases-gives-subscribers-more-rewards-points-instead">Microsoft has confirmed to <i>IGN</i></a> that instead of getting a 10-percent discount on DLC, you’ll now just earn more Rewards.</p>

 <p>“Rewards” are a non-Xbox-exclusive program that basically lets you earn money to spend on various Microsoft products. You can earn points otherwise by browsing the web with Bing while using Microsoft Edge (lol what are we doing here, ya’ll?), and now by playing games with an active Game Pass subscription.</p> <p>If that sounds confusing, I regret to inform you that it’s probably that way by design. Essential will net you up to $25 in rewards per year, Premium allows for up to $50, and Ultimate will let you earn up to $100. You can read all of the <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/rewards/about">nitty gritty details about the Microsoft Rewards program here</a>.</p>

 <h2>What are other gaming subscription services charging?</h2> <p>Pricier subs, the death of discounts, it all sounds painful and it is! That might have you wondering what’s going on with other subscription services, especially if you value an ongoing service over just straight-up purchasing and owning your games.</p> <p><a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-us/ps-plus/#subscriptions">PlayStation has a similar three-tier structure</a> (no options for PC gamers though). The most costly version of these will only cost you $160 for the full year, which is a full $200 less than what Xbox is charging for Ultimate. The most basic version of its subscription service will only cost you $80/year, but it doesn’t come with a game catalog. You’ll need to buy the middle-tier option at a minimum for that, which will run you $15/month or $135/year.</p> <p>Meanwhile, <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/online/">Nintendo has two subscription services</a> but doesn’t offer any Switch games via a Netflix-style, download-on-demand service. Its most basic service costs $20/year, lets you play online among other benefits, and lets you play from a library of NES, SNES, and Game Boy games whenever you want. At $50/year, a pricier tier expands that retro library to include select GameCube, GBA, N64, and Sega Genesis games (yes, really!).</p>

 <h2>A reminder: No company can increase the cost of games you fully ‘own’</h2> <p>I put ‘own’ in quotes there because, especially on PC, there’s debate as to whether or not our Steam libraries (or any digital library) is made up of the games themselves, or is just a collection of licenses granting us access to the games. (There’s always GOG if you want to be sure you’ll just get straight up .exe files of your games, though it is a more limited collection.) But that argument aside, if you plunk down $60-70 bucks to snag a new game that doesn’t have a perpetual monetization scheme baked into it, you will continue to have access to that game without needing a corporation to charge you every month.</p> <p>Maybe you’ll have a smaller library of games available to you at any given moment, but at least they’ll be yours. Period. Consider it.</p> <p><b>Read More:</b> <a href="https://kotaku.com/xbox-next-gen-console-leak-rumor-costco-sams-club-2000632026">Xbox Still Swears It’s Not Giving Up On Console As Fan Morale Craters</a></p> <p>Subscriptions make sense for many folks, no doubt. But having direct access to your games keeps you away from these kinds of shenanigans, and I shudder to think there’s a generation of gamers growing up right now that think more about getting an Ultimate Game Pass card for their birthdays or holidays than an actual copy, digital or physical, of a game that they’ll own for the foreseeable future.</p>
