              <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/the-best-far-cry-game-1680319871"><em>Far Cry 7</em></a> was not supposed to take this long but Ubisoft CEO Yves Guillemot is promising the wait will be worth it. Asked about the state of the publisher’s biggest franchises and why they’re taking so long to make in a recent interview, the cofounder took the unusual step of confirming the existence of two previously reported upcoming<em> Far Cry</em> projects.</p> <p>“We have a solid pipeline underway across Vantage Studios,” he <a href="https://variety.com/2026/gaming/news/ubisoft-ceo-interview-yves-guillemot-layoffs-creative-house-1236667500/">told <em>Variety</em></a> this week. “Under the <em>Assassin’s Creed</em> brand, several titles are in development, spanning both single-player and multiplayer experiences, with the ambition to further grow a community that exceeded 30 million players last year. On <em>Far Cry</em>, anticipation is high, and we currently have two very promising projects in development.”</p> <p>The existence of both of these projects was <a href="https://kotaku.com/far-cry-7-multiplayer-ubisoft-star-wars-snowdrop-1850038103">first reported back in early 2023</a>.&nbsp;<em>Far Cry 7</em> was being developed under the codename Project Blackbird while the second game, a multiplayer spin-off, was being developed under the codename <em>Project Maverick</em>. While Ubisoft mentioned both games in internal presentations at the time as the company doubled-down on its biggest franchises, they continue to face delays and remain MIA <a href="https://kotaku.com/far-cry-7-assassins-creed-hexe-ghost-recon-delay-1851780674">as the company tries to implement higher-standard quality checks</a>.</p>

 <h2>Why is <em>Far Cry 7</em> taking so long?</h2> <p>Historically, big <em>Far Cry</em> sequels have come out every two to three years, with smaller spin-offs releasing in-between. Since Ubisoft bought the franchise and launched <em>Far Cry 2</em> back in 2008, the longest gap between new entries was four years. It will have been five years since <em>Far Cry 6</em> released come this fall. A similar breakdown in the pipeline has hit other major Ubisoft franchises as it gets more complex and expensive to develop AAA blockbusters.</p> <p>As <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ubisoft-confirms-far-cry-and-assassins-creed/"><em>Insider Gaming</em> reports</a>, the <em>Far Cry</em> multiplayer spin-off Maverick in particular has faced major challenges. While it started as an extraction shooter, Maverick has continued to evolve and morph during development. While Ubisoft has continued to produce impressive, massive open-world single-player adventures, its forays into multiplayer have gone terrible. From <em>Hyper Scape</em> to <em>XDefiant</em>, and all of the botched and canceled live service projects in-between, Ubisoft has been unable to recreate the success of its biggest multiplayer staple, <em>Rainbow Six Siege</em>.</p>

 <p>“Several” <em>Assassin’s Creed</em> games are just around the corner</p> <p>On the <em>Assassin’s Creed</em> front, the path forward is looking much clearer. An unannounced remake of <em>Assassin’s Creed IV: Black Flag</em> appears to still be on track for release in 2026 despite a recent delay. The previously teased multiplayer spin-off Invictus is also still “locked-in,” according <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ubisoft-confirms-far-cry-and-assassins-creed/">to <em>Insider Gaming</em></a>, with the next single-player game, <em>Hexe</em>, reportedly slated for 2027. Multiple unannounced mobile spin-offs were recently canceled, however, and a mobile game from <a href="https://twitter.com/assassinscreed/status/1568694651800133632?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1568694651800133632%7Ctwgr%5Eb9b4ae047170f42a47dc2044f55096d535b137cb%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fkotaku.com%2Fassassins-creed-red-mirage-ubisoft-hexe-jade-netflix-1849521945">Netflix called <em>Jade</em></a> seems unlikely to ever see the light of day as the streamer pivots to licensed party games.</p>

 <p>Whatever happens to Ubisoft as it partitions its sprawling empire of studios into easily sellable “Creative Houses,” <em>Far Cry</em> and <em>Assassin’s Creed</em> will remain corner stones of whatever’s left. There’s already a <em>Far Cry</em> TV series in development at FX and a new <em>Assassin’s Creed</em> historical drama coming to Netflix. All Ubisoft has to do is actually release a new Far Cry game at some point while bringing some excitement and shine back to <em>Assassin’s Creed</em>.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Hackers Raise The Alarm About Discord’s Recent Age-Verification Partner]]></title>
            <link>https://kotaku.com/discord-age-verification-hack-persona-2000672570</link>
            <guid>1442752</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><span>Last week, Discord </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/discord-palantir-peter-thiel-persona-age-verification-2000668951"><span>users reported prompts to submit personal information to Persona</span></a><span>, a third-party age-verification service. As Discord commits to universal age-verification, the new measures have come under </span><a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/software/platforms/oh-good-discords-age-verification-rollout-has-ties-to-palantir-co-founder-and-panopticon-architect-peter-thiel/"><span>intense scrutiny</span></a><span> after </span><a href="https://discord.com/press-releases/update-on-security-incident-involving-third-party-customer-service"><span>previous security failures</span></a><span>. Now a trio of hacktivists say they’ve successfully breached Persona, getting a closer look at how the company uses submitted biometrics. They say their findings raise alarms beyond leaks.</span></p> <p><a href="https://www.therage.co/persona-age-verification/"><span>According to </span><i><span>The Rage</span></i></a><span>, Persona’s front-end security left a lot to be desired. Worse, however, were investigative findings that suggested Persona’s surveillance of the users whose data it collected was way more sprawling than originally believed.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><span>“It was initially meant to be a passive recon investigation,” </span><a href="https://vmfunc.re/blog/persona"><span>writes vmfunc, a cybersecurity researcher and one of the hackers</span></a><span>, “that quickly turned into a rabbit hole deep dive into how commercial AI and federal government operations work together to violate our privacy every waking second.”</span></p> <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">I'm sharing all email correspondences between <a href="https://twitter.com/vmfunc?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@vmfunc</a> and myself in advance of <a href="https://twitter.com/vmfunc?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@vmfunc</a>'s later blog posts because without context, a signed statement from myself has only created more conspiracy theories regarding Persona. <a href="https://t.co/nDJorLEP4H">pic.twitter.com/nDJorLEP4H</a></p> <p>— Rick Song (@rickcsong) <a href="https://twitter.com/rickcsong/status/2024423711559102578?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">February 19, 2026</a></p></blockquote>  <p><span>On top of finding it surprisingly easy to access data gathered by Persona, the research showed that faces and biometrics were not just being scanned for age verification, but flagged for suspicious behaviour and bounced off watchlists as well. To some this may not sound like an Orwellian level of intrusion (or to people who don’t worry about their face being deemed ‘suspicious’), until you remember Persona’s full network.</span></p>

 <p><span>Persona </span><a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-09-15/founders-fund-values-identity-startup-persona-at-1-5-billion"><span>received $150 million in 2021</span></a><span> from the Founders Fund, a long-running tech investor group headed by Peter Thiel. Thiel’s main business, on top of </span><a href="https://www.wired.com/story/epstein-files-tech-elites-gates-thiel-musk/"><span>palling around in Jeffery Epstein’s emails</span></a><span> and </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/hulk-hogan-sex-tape-gawker-lawsuit-kotaku-go-media-1851787000"><span>waiting for the antichrist</span></a><span>, is Palantir, an intentionally ominously-named data brokering service that is currently </span><a href="https://www.404media.co/elite-the-palantir-app-ice-uses-to-find-neighborhoods-to-raid/"><span>peddling user information for ICE-raids</span></a><span>. The findings of vmfunc and co’s research doesn’t directly tether Persona and Discord’s operations to Palantir or Thiel, but it wouldn’t be conspiratorial to point out that all this data seems to be funnelling along similar slopes.</span></p>

 <h2>Trust but verify</h2> <p><span>Persona has confirmed the breach, CEO Rick Song corresponding and </span><a href="https://x.com/rickcsong/status/2025038040599810385"><span>even thanking the</span></a><span> hackers for flagging the security exploit. This has not, however, </span><a href="https://x.com/vmfunc/status/2024433404683374921"><span>tempered concerns</span></a><span> among those hacktivists about how the user information is ultimately being used.</span></p> <p><span>“Transparently, we are actively working on a couple of potential contracts which would be publicly visible if we move forward,” writes Christie Kim, chief operating officer at Persona, </span><a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2026/02/discord-and-persona-end-partnership-after-shady-uk-age-test-sparks-outcry/"><span>in an email regarding the security breach and speculation around Discord</span></a><span>. “However, these engagements are strictly for workforce account security of government employees and do not include ICE or any agency within the Department of Homeland Security.”</span></p>

 <p><span>After the alarm was initially raised about Persona, Discord claimed its work with the Thiel-backed firm was only temporary, and that it didn’t have new contacts with it moving forward. It also promised user info was being wiped from servers within seven days of being gathered.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>In a statement provided to </span><i><span>Kotaku</span></i><span>, Discord said the “limited test” had concluded, though what Persona does with the information in that period isn’t clarified. It seems to go much further than verifying which PlayStation you grew up with. Even after the dust settles, it’s unclear if the trust can ever be repaired as an exodus of Discord users have already </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/discord-alternative-teamspeak-age-verification-check-rivals-2000669693"><span>flooded alternatives like TeamSpeak</span></a><span>.</span></p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/the-best-steam-deck-games-ever-megabonk-balatro-vampire-survivors-2000667367</link>
            <guid>1442623</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Four years after its release, <a href="https://kotaku.com/valve-steam-deck-pc-console-switch-horizon-zero-dawn-re-1848628507">Valve’s Steam Deck</a> is still the most popular handheld PC around and for good reason. The portable gaming device is easy to use, can play most 2D games you install on it with ease, handles 3D games fairly well, and can even be modded and tweaked if you so desire. It’s a marvelous machine, and if you are here, you likely own one or are about to buy one and want some video game recommendations. Thankfully, you’ve come to the right list, my friend.</p> <p>Below you’ll find the 15 best PC games to play on your <a href="https://kotaku.com/steam-deck-nintendo-switch-performance-pc-emulation-1849827018">Steam Deck</a>. For this list, we tried to include a mix of “classic” Steam Deck games—yes,<em> Vampire Survivors</em> is on here—as well as some titles that don’t always get mentioned when talking about the system. This list also features some bigger games as well as experiences that might be perfect for killing time at a bus stop or a short train ride. Lastly, for this list, we tried to stick to games that run well on the Deck without having to make weird tweaks or install mods.</p>

 <p>Hopefully, at least one of these games is what you were looking for and lets you enjoy your Steam Deck a little more.</p> <h2><em>Vampire Survivors</em></h2>  <p>Any list of best Steam Deck games is legally obligated to include <em>Vampire Survivors.</em> At this point, Valve should just pay Poncle some amount of money to have <em>Vampire Survivors</em> pre-installed on all Steam Decks. Anyway, yeah, it’s cheap, fun, runs great, and is a perfect game for the Steam Deck. I’d say play it, but you likely already have.</p>

 <h2><em>Stardew Valley</em></h2>  <p>Another “legally obligated” recommendation, but hey, <em>Stardew Valley</em> is great, and it runs like a dream on Steam Deck. And if you want to get wild, unlike the Switch port of this popular cozy slice of life farming sim, <em>Stardew Valley</em> on Steam Deck can be modded. You don’t need to do that to play it, to be clear, but if you want to, it is an option on Deck.</p>

 <h2><em>Balatro</em></h2>  <p>Okay, last one of these “legally obligated” entries, but yes, <em>Balatro</em> is an incredible game. One of the best games released in the last few years. Playing this strange poker rogue-like with bizarre joker cards is a blast regardless of where you play. On Steam Deck, <em>Balatro</em> is a treat, won’t kill your battery, and takes up little room. A no-brainer to toss on your Deck.</p> <h2><em>Dave the Diver</em></h2>  <p>Some of the best games for the Steam Deck are ones built around “runs.” Games built like this let you hop in for a bit, then put the console to sleep when your bus arrives or your meeting starts. <em>Dave the Diver,</em> being split into different days, makes it one of these perfect Steam Deck games. Also helping is <em>Dave the Diver</em>‘s 2D art style which the Deck can handle without breaking a sweat. It’s never been easier to catch and cook digital fish on the go.</p>

 <h2><em>Blue Prince</em></h2>  <p>Someone told me this was their Steam Deck bedtime game, and I get it. Slowly exploring a cozy but mysterious mansion that shifts every time you visit and is filled with puzzles to solve is a perfect activity to engage in for a bit before calling it a night. <em>Blue Prince</em>‘s 3D visuals don’t push the Steam Deck hard, and it plays effortlessly on a gamepad, making this a fantastic way to play one of 2025’s best-reviewed games.</p> <h2><em>Dredge</em></h2>  <p>For those looking for something creepy to play on their Steam Deck, but not interested in a really scary game, <em>Dredge</em> is a great option. Not only does <em>Dredge</em> run well on the Deck, but it’s yet another game divided up into days, letting you jump in for a bit of fishing in its unsettling waters without making you commit to hours of cutscenes and action. Perfect for a lunch break run or a quick bit of game time on the toilet. Look, I’m not here to judge where or how you use the Deck, okay?</p> <h2><em>Deep Rock Galactic Survivor</em></h2>  <p>You could probably fill up a Steam Deck with nothing but a ton of auto-shooter games that play a lot like <em>Vampire Survivors</em>. (In fact, there’s one more coming up on this list.) But among&nbsp;the many, many games that followed in <em>Vampire Survivors</em>‘ wake, <a href="https://kotaku.com/deep-rock-galactic-survival-vampire-survivors-roguelike-1851276484"><em>Deep Rock Galactic Survivor</em></a> is one of the best. Adding sci-fi dwarves and mining and sub-challenges to the formula helps elevate this one beyond a mere clone. It runs well on Deck, too, though its 3D visuals will eat up battery faster than <em>Vampire Survivors</em>.</p>

 <h2><em>Hades / Hades 2</em></h2>  <p>At one point, this list contained separate entries for <em>Hades</em> and its 2025 sequel. Then the list just had one, but mentioned the other. Let’s just save some time and internet ink and combine them into one entry. Both <em>Hades</em> games are impeccably designed action roguelikes that feature hot Greek gods, plenty of action, and gorgeous visuals that look like the coolest animated movie ever.&nbsp; And both <em>Hades</em> and <a href="https://kotaku.com/hades-ii-the-kotaku-review-2000628064"><em>Hades 2</em></a> play like a dream on Steam Deck. You really can’t go wrong with your choice.</p> <h2><em>Sektori</em></h2>  <p><em>Geometry Wars</em> was a good game. What if someone made a new one? Well, they did, and it’s called <a href="https://kotaku.com/this-twin-stick-shooter-is-the-new-geometry-wars-and-it-rules-2000650227"><em>Sektori</em>, and it’s awesome</a> on any platform you play it on. And that includes the Steam Deck, where <em>Sektori</em> looks and runs flawlessly while delivering fast and fluid twin-stick shooter fun. You can’t ask for much more for $15.</p>

 <h2><em>Elden Ring</em></h2>  <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/elden-ring-valve-pc-steam-deck-namco-bandai-stuttering-1848664299">When <em>Elden Ring</em> first arrived back in 2022</a>, the Steam Deck ended up being one of the best places to play FromSoftware’s hit open-world RPG. Flash forward to today, and it’s still a damn fine way to enjoy <em>Elden Ring.</em> It might not look as crisp as it will on a PS5 or a high-end PC, and it will eat your battery up quickly, but that’s all worth it to have such a fantastic game playable anywhere.</p> <h2><em>Resident Evil 2</em></h2>  <p>A surprising number of modern <em>Resident Evil</em> games run well on the Steam Deck, but I still think the remake of <em>Resident Evil 2</em> might be the best one to play on Valve’s portable PC. It’s not too big, doesn’t push the system too hard, and is a great installment in the franchise. It might not be as easy to drop in and out of this game as others on the list, but <em>Resident Evil 2</em> is still a great choice to play on the Deck. Just maybe leave the lights on?</p> <h2><em>Big Hops</em></h2>  <p>Sure, <a href="https://kotaku.com/nintendo-could-learn-something-from-this-incredible-3d-platformer-2000660289"><em>Big Hop</em>s</a> was just released in January, but that doesn’t change the fact that this 3D platformer heavily inspired by <em>Mario</em> deserves a place on this list. Not only because it’s a joyful and creative platformer about a frog with a very useful tongue, but also because it looks sharp as heck and runs perfectly at 60FPS on the Deck. The world needs more fun 3D platformers, and <em>Big Hops</em> is here to answer that call.</p>

 <h2><em>Warframe</em></h2>  <p>For a few different reasons, there aren’t many big live-service online games available for the Steam Deck. So, free-to-play ninja shooter <em>Warframe</em> being fully playable on the device is very cool. If you’ve always wanted to slice up robots and aliens while running 70MPH in a cyber ninja suit, this is the game for you. And you can do all of that and more while killing time at the airport, assuming you have a solid wi-fi connection, as <em>Warframe</em> is an online-only game.</p> <h2><em>TMNT Shredder’s Revenge</em></h2>  <p>A 2D pixel art brawler is just about the perfect video game for the Steam Deck, and <em>TMNT Shredder’s Revenge</em> is one of the best you can find on Steam. So of course we added it to this list. And for those of you going “But this is better with other people!” don’t worry. You can just connect multiple gamepads to the Steam Deck and do some portable brawlin’ with pals wherever you want. Or connect your Steam Deck to a TV and enjoy one of the best <em>TMNT</em> games ever made.</p> <h2><em>Megabonk</em></h2>  <p><em>Vampire Survivors</em>&nbsp;but 3D and weirder is the elevator pitch for <a href="https://kotaku.com/megabonk-vampire-survivors-clone-steam-pc-2000627591"><em>Megabonk</em></a>. And it might be one of the best things to play on a Steam Deck. Even when the hordes of enemies get massive, the game’s framerate stays steady, and it feels perfect to play on a gamepad. The world doesn’t need many more auto-shooters, but it’s nice that we got one more that’s as good and fun as <em>Megabonk</em>. And it’s just $10.</p>
