            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Nintendo has a history of making weird announcements out of the blue. Remember last year’s alarm clock? But even in its current chaotic era of tweeting out game reveals and doing hour-long follow-up livestreams for games like <em>Kirby Air Riders</em>, Wednesday’s <em>Pikmin 4</em> announcement is low-key bizarre.</p> <p>The <em>Mario</em> maker revealed its 2023 strategy adventure game will be getting a free update two years later. But not for the newly released Switch 2. Instead, <em>Pikmin 4</em> will get new content in November for the original Switch version. That game can be played on the new hardware, obviously, but an official Switch 2 upgrade remains nowhere in sight. Hmmm.</p>

 <p>The meat of the update revolves around new cross-functionality between <em>Pikmin 4</em> and <em>Pikmin Bloom</em>, the augmented-reality mobile spin-off by the creators of <em>Pokémon Go</em>. Decor Pikmin, which wear funny outfits and were previously only available in <em>Bloom</em>, can now be found in <em>Pikmin 4</em> and transferred back and forth between both games. Meanwhile, <em>Pikmin 4</em>‘s Ice Pikmin will be joining <em>Bloom</em> for the first time to mark that game’s fourth anniversary.</p>

  <p>The rest of the update includes a camera mode for <em>Pikmin 4</em> and new difficulty settings to make the game easier or more challenging. There’s also now a free demo for the game on the eShop. <em>Pikmin 4</em> sold <a href="https://www.nintendo.co.jp/ir/pdf/2023/231107_4e.pdf">over 2.5 million copies</a>, making it the best-selling game in the franchise that began back on the GameCube, but still far from one of the platform’s bigger first-party sellers.</p>

 <p>So why <em>Pikmin</em>? Why now? And why on the original Switch? Nintendo hasn’t shied away from making DLC and packaging it with paid “next-gen upgrades” to push sales of older Switch games on the new hardware. At the same time, this seems unlikely to feed into any meaningful holiday resurgence in<em> Pikmin 4</em> for the original console, with the update wedged in-between <em>Pokémon Legends: Z-A</em> and <em>Metroid Prime 4</em>.</p>

 <h2>Is Nintendo laying the groundwork for <em>Pikmin 5</em> or something completely different?</h2> <p>There’s also the extra weirdness with this update coming just after Nintendo released a couple of Pixar-like <em>Pikmin</em> shorts. <a href="https://kotaku.com/nintendo-pikmin-short-animated-film-mario-zelda-app-2000633651">It claims</a> those were tests to prove out the capabilities of its new internal Nintendo Pictures team, but the company rarely does random one-offs on a whim. Could this all be laying the groundwork for Nintendo’s next <em>Pikmin</em> project? And will that be a full-fledged <em>Pikmin </em>sequel, a <em>Pikmin</em>-centric movie or TV series, or a more unorthodox venture in the toy or theme park realm?</p>

 <p>There’s also the Shigeru Miyamoto factor. The famed Nintendo developer created the <em>Pikmin</em> franchise and it clearly lives near and dear to his heart. Would <em>Pikmin 4</em> have even happened without him pushing for it? He told press it was close to completion back in 2015, only for it to lay dormant until it was suddenly re-revealed in 2022 and released the following year.</p>

 <p><em>Pikmin 4</em> is also notable among Nintendo’s first-party projects for being made in Unreal Engine 4. There’s also that mysterious MMO playtest Nintendo performed exactly a year ago this week. It included <a href="https://kotaku.com/nintendo-playtest-switch-2-mario-mmo-1851677142">world-crafting mechanics and user-generated content references</a> that suggested things like <em>Minecraft</em> and <em>Roblox</em> were possible inspirations.</p> <p>Could Nintendo be prepping a <em>Pikmin</em> crossover with <em>Fortnite</em>? Will the next <em>Pikmin</em> game be Nintendo’s ambitious take on the survival crafting MMO genre? Will Miyamoto return to development to make it the last game he ever directs? Or is Nintendo just throwing hardcore <em>Pikmin 4</em> stans one last bone before the franchise goes dark for another decade?</p>

              <p>Ubisoft is asking an unknown number of developers at the studio behind <em>The Division 2</em>, <em>Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora</em>, and <em>Star Wars Outlaws</em> to voluntarily lay themselves off as part of the French publisher’s latest cost-cutting restructuring.</p> <p>“As part of our ongoing evolution and long-term planning, we have recently realigned our teams and resources to strengthen our roadmap, ensuring our continued focus on <em>The Division</em> franchise and the technologies, including Snowdrop and Ubisoft Connect, that power our games,” the Sweden-based studio <a href="https://x.com/UbiMassive/status/1981020343587258732/photo/1">announced in a statement</a> on Wednesday. “To support this transition responsibly, we introduced a voluntary career transition program, giving eligible team members the opportunity to take their next career step on their own terms, supported by a comprehensive package that includes financial and career assistance.”</p>

 <p>Massive was acquired by Ubisoft from Activision Blizzard back in 2008. It initially began supporting the publisher on <em>Assassin’s Creed</em> and<em> Far Cry</em> before spearheading the development of <em>The Division</em>, an ambitious multiplayer shooter that let players team up or fight one another over loot in a ghostly depiction of post-outbreak New York. While its Snowdrop engine is now being used in the development of the next<em> Far Cry</em>, recent licensed projects like <em>Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora</em> and <em>Star Wars Outlaws</em> haven’t delivered new best-selling franchises.</p>

 <p>The cuts come as Ubisoft shifts its management structure under a new deal with Chinese conglomerate Tencent which has invested over $1 billion in a a smaller subsidiary called Vantage Studios which will prioritize franchises like <em>Assassin’s Creed</em>, <em>Far Cry</em>, and <em>Rainbow Six Siege</em>. With none of the projects it leads in that group, Massive appears to be on the chopping block, though it’s unclear how many actual developers will be laid off as part of this new initiative.</p> <p>The studio says it will remain focused on delivering promised content within the<em>&nbsp;Division</em> universe, including<em> The Division 2</em>,<em> The Division 2: Survivors</em>,<em> The Division Resurgence</em>, and and eventual <em>Division 3</em>.</p>
