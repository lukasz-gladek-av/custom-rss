            <link>https://kotaku.com/roborock-dumps-22000pa-robot-vacuum-at-zero-profit-self-emptying-tech-now-at-all-time-low-2000648426</link>

              <p>Cheap robot vacuums that bump randomly around rooms, miss entire areas and get stuck constantly serve no purpose beyond cluttering the market and disappointing <strong>buyers who conclude that robot vacuums fundamentally don’t work</strong>. These failures damage the category’s reputation while advanced models demonstrate what’s actually possible when engineering takes priority over cost-cutting that creates barely functional products.</p>
<p>The <strong>Roborock Saros 10R</strong> represents ultra-premium robot vacuum technology that handles everything, and it is now available at <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5750/">$999 during Black Friday on Amazon, down from $1,599</a>. The $600 reduction brings this flagship model to pricing closer to Roborock’s mid-tier offerings before this sale, and makes the best autonomous cleaning accessible without the usual four-figure investment.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5750/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>3.14-Inch Ultra-Slim Design That Fits Everywhere</h2>
<p>The <strong>new slim 3.14-inch profile gets rid of the raised LiDAR towers</strong> that stop regular robot vacuums from getting under furniture with low clearance, where dust builds up without being disturbed. Cleaning beds, sofas, cabinets, and coffee tables is now possible instead of having to manually vacuum or let dust build up all the time.</p>



<p>The <strong>22,000Pa suction gives it cleaning power that rivals high-end upright vacuums</strong>&nbsp;and the robot itself is small and can move around on its own. This powerful suction pulls out pet hair that is stuck deep in carpet fibers that weaker robots can’t reach, lifts dirt that has been ground into tile grout lines, and picks up fine dust from hardwood floors in one pass without needing to clean again. The <em>DuoDivide</em> main brush and <em>FlexiArm</em> <em>Riser</em> side brush don’t get tangled up so they can handle hair up to 40 cm long without the problems that other robots have.</p>
<p>The <em>FlexiArm Riser</em> technology is the first of its kind in the industry: It lets <strong>both the side brush and the mop automatically reach corners and edges</strong> that fixed-position cleaning heads can’t get to. Watch the arm swing out when it gets close to baseboards. It cleans all the way up to the walls instead of leaving the one-inch dirt lines that regular robots leave along the edges.</p>



<p>The <em>AdaptiLift</em> chassis has wheels that can be <strong>adjusted independently and can climb over things up to 4 cm high</strong> like door thresholds, thick rugs, and cable runs that stop regular robots from working without help. The system changes the height of each wheel based on the terrain, keeping the robot stable as it goes over obstacles that would tip or beach standard robots with fixed chassis heights.</p>
<p>The dock does all of the maintenance work such as removing the mop automatically for vacuum-only modes, washing the mop with 176°F hot water to get rid of tough stains, drying it with 131°F hot air to stop mildew, c<strong>ollecting dust automatically every 60 days</strong>, refilling the tank automatically, dispensing detergent automatically, and cleaning the hot water dock itself.</p>
<p>Roborock’s best technology costs $999 on Black Friday which is the lowest price ever and it saves you $600. Their mid-range models don’t have the ultra-slim design, <em>FlexiArm</em> extension, <em>AdaptiLift</em> chassis, or full dock automation that their best models do. If you want to really get rid of manual floor cleaning with technology that works, this is the deal for you.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/amazons-fire-tv-cube-is-2x-faster-than-the-fire-tv-stick-4k-max-and-can-be-yours-now-for-just-90-2000647768</link>
            <guid>1367524</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Amazon is on a mission to make streaming easy for everyone with its compact, feature-packed devices, and the retailer is now letting you bring one home without paying the full price.</p>
<p>Black Friday kicks off tomorrow, but Amazon is already offering up to 50% off its top-rated entertainment gadgets, smart home devices, TVs, and more.<a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4111/"> The sale also brings the price of Amazon’s fastest-ever streaming media player — the Fire TV Cube — down to just $90.</a> That’s after a whopping 36% drop on the retail price of $140. Best of all, using the code ALEXAPLUS10 at checkout nets you another $10 discount in Amazon Credit with your purchase.</p>
<p>Moreover, if you have an older Fire TV device lying around, you can trade it in to get an additional 20% off your total, plus an Amazon gift card, making the purchase even sweeter. But just note that such offers tend to wrap up fast, so you don’t have a lot of time left to bag the discounts. If you have been looking to give your entertainment experience a boost, now is the time to make that happen.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4111/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Hands-Free Streaming</h2>
<p>The cube, in a way, blends the functionality of both a streaming stick and an Echo. It comes with a built-in HDMI input and features additional ports for you to connect other entertainment devices for a fuller setup.</p>
<p>The new octa-core 2.0 GHz processor at the center makes it twice as fast as the Fire TV Stick 4K Max, letting you launch apps and browse content within seconds. Support for Wi-Fi 6E translates into smoother 4K streaming with faster speeds, more bandwidth, and low latency, meaning you can search your favorite content fast, plus enjoy an uninterrupted, cinema-like viewing experience right from your couch. Visuals and sound don’t take a hit, either. 4K Ultra HD keeps picture quality lifelike, while Dolby Atmos Audio support puts the sound all around for a 3D experience. Super Resolution Upscaling makes it easy to convert an HD picture to 4K for better detail, so all your favorite classics are going to come to life, as well.</p>



<p>Navigating around is made easy with voice control. Not in the mood to press some buttons? Just ask Alexa to do it for you. You can find movies by actor, plot, and even iconic quotes. Just say something like “Alexa, show me the latest Christmas movies” or “Alexa, show me crime thrillers with unexpected endings”, and it’s going to pull every relevant title up in no time. Entertainment options come built right in, as well. The cube lets you stream more than 1.8 million movies and TV episodes. You’ll have all your favorite streaming platforms (Netflix, Prime Video, Disney+, Peacock, and more) in a single place. It even doubles as a speaker when you’re in the mood to listen to some songs in the background as you finish house chores.</p>
<p>Setting everything up couldn’t be easier. Simply connect the Fire TV Cube to your TV’s HDMI port, and then your WiFi. Follow the on-screen prompts to finish the process; as simple as that. If you have speakers around, it’s recommended to place the cube at least 1 to 2 feet away from them to avoid interference. The device also comes with early access to Alexa+, which is an advanced, more sophisticated version of the OG Alexa. It communicates better, understands context well, and can remember information from previous parts of a conversation.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4111/">Thanks to Black Friday, the Fire TV Cube is now sitting at just $90, plus there are additional offers you can take advantage of to maximize your savings.</a></p>

            <title><![CDATA[Forget $4,000 Apple VR Headset, Meta Quest 3S Drops to All-Time Low With 50K Units Sold on Amazon]]></title>
            <link>https://kotaku.com/forget-4000-apple-vr-headset-meta-quest-3s-drops-to-all-time-low-with-50k-units-sold-on-amazon-2000648422</link>
            <guid>1367458</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>The Meta Quest 3 established new VR standards when it launched but its premium pricing kept virtual reality aspirational rather than accessible for mainstream buyers. Meta addressed this barrier by releasing the Quest 3<strong>S</strong> as a lighter and more affordable variant that maintains core functionality while cutting costs through strategic compromises that most users won’t notice during actual gameplay.</p>
<p>Right now, <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5604/">the Quest 3S costs $249 for the 128GB model during Black Friday on Amazon, down from $299</a>, which makes this the <strong>best entry point into modern VR</strong> without the $499 Quest 3 investment. The aggressive pricing combined with complete wireless freedom and instant access to 40-plus games creates exceptional value that explains why the 3S outsells its premium sibling.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5604/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Snapdragon XR2 Gen 2 That Works Well</h2>
<p>Qualcomm’s newest XR-specific silicon is optimized for the unique computational needs of virtual reality and it gives the processor twice the graphical processing power of the previous Quest 2 generation. Games load quickly so you don’t have to wait around like you did with older headsets and complex scenes render smoothly at high frame rates, which is important for avoiding motion sickness.</p>
<p>The next-generation graphics make the<strong> visuals almost as good as those on the PlayStation 5</strong> and they do it in standalone wireless headset form factors, which means you don’t need a gaming PC like you did with older VR systems, which were expensive and hard to use. The performance is good enough for demanding games like realistic simulators, fast-paced shooters and detailed adventure games that would stutter or crash on hardware that isn’t powerful enough.</p>



<p>The <strong>8GB of RAM is 33% more than what most budget VR headsets offer</strong>: This makes it easier to switch between VR environments, load textures with more detail without pop-in, and generally make the game more responsive. With more memory, developers can make more ambitious experiences with bigger worlds, more things on screen at once, and better graphics without having to make the trade-offs that come with limited RAM.</p>
<p>The <strong>freedom of wireless technology gets rid of the cords</strong> that made early VR systems so annoying: Players had to always be aware of where the cords were so they wouldn’t trip or pull on the headsets while playing. During room-scale VR experiences for instance, you can move naturally through physical spaces. In shooters, you can spin 360 degrees to track enemies from all directions. This makes setup much easier and lets you use VR anywhere, not just in dedicated gaming rooms.</p>
<p>The <strong>two RGB color cameras let you see everything in full color and mix virtual objects with your real-world surroundings</strong> through mixed reality experiences. You can see your real furniture, walls, and surroundings in color, and virtual objects look like they belong there. This lets you play games that interact with real spaces. With passthrough, you can clearly see the real world instead of the grainy black-and-white feeds that made earlier systems confusing.</p>



<p>The <strong>Gorilla Tag bundle gives Quest 3S buyers special in-game items and 1,000 shiny rocks currency</strong>: This makes the social VR game even more valuable, and it’s become a huge hit. Instead of using traditional joystick controls, Gorilla Tag uses arm-swinging locomotion to simulate how gorillas move. This gives the game a unique physicality that makes it very popular even though the graphics are simple.</p>
<p>The <strong>included three-month trial gives you instant access to more than 40 games</strong> which means you won’t have to pay for software right after you buy new hardware. You can try out different types of VR experiences, like action games, creative tools, fitness apps, and social platforms, without spending hundreds of dollars on software before you know what types of games you like.</p>
<p>The<strong> battery lasts for more than two hours</strong> which is enough for most gaming sessions without needing to stop and charge in the middle of a game, which breaks immersion. However, for longer marathon sessions, you’ll need to use a power bank or take breaks to charge. The runtime is long enough for most people who play for 30 to 90 minutes, which is about the same as the average attention span for active VR gameplay, which is more physically engaging than passive screen entertainment.</p>
<p>Meta’s current-generation VR technology costs less than many game consoles at the record-low price of $249 on Black Friday. If you’ve been curious about virtual reality but didn’t want to pay a lot for it, this deal makes modern VR possible at prices that make it worth it to try.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Nothing Headphone (1) Clearly Can’t Make Profit at This Record Low, Now Over 2× Cheaper Than AirPods Max]]></title>
            <link>https://kotaku.com/nothing-headphone-1-come-down-to-their-lowest-price-yet-for-black-friday-2000647680</link>
            <guid>1367455</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p data-start="62" data-end="797">There are countless reasons to invest in a quality pair of headphones—especially ones equipped with active noise cancellation. Being able to shut out the world and immerse yourself in what you <em data-start="255" data-end="265">actually</em> want to hear makes a huge difference, whether you’re stuck on a long, noisy flight or trying to concentrate in a busy workspace. If you’re in the market for a stylish and capable option, the Nothing headphones are worth a look. With their distinctive transparent design and sleek, technical aesthetic, they stand out visually. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6042/">Currently, they’re available at a 20% discount. Normally priced at $299, you can pick them up now for $239, saving $60 for Black Friday and Cyber Monday.</a></p>
<p data-start="799" data-end="1484">These headphones feature advanced, intelligent noise cancellation technology. Using next-generation processing and adaptive microphones, they continuously analyze your surroundings and automatically adjust the level of noise reduction. The over-ear design further enhances isolation by forming a secure acoustic seal around your ears. The result is a listening experience free from interruptions—perfect for music, audiobooks, or podcasts. When you need to re-engage with your environment, you can switch it over to Transparency Mode which lets outside sounds pass through naturally. This is especially helpful when walking through busy areas or responding to a coworker without removing your headphones.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6042/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2 data-start="1486" data-end="1508">Hands-Free Control</h2>
<p data-start="1510" data-end="2171">The Nothing headphones conveniently offers an onboard control system that minimizes the need to reach for your phone. A dedicated side button allows quick access to apps like Spotify, letting you launch your audio without digging into your pocket. On the opposite earcup, a paddle lets you skip tracks or jump ahead in podcasts. Holding it down allows you to scrub through your audio with precision. Above this, a roller gives you intuitive control over volume, playback, and toggling between Active Noise Cancellation and Transparency Mode. Altogether, the controls are designed to keep your listening experience smooth and uninterrupted.</p>
<p data-start="2173" data-end="2652">Battery life is reliably long. With ANC turned off, you can enjoy up to an impressive 80 hours of listening time—enough for several days of use without recharging. Even with ANC enabled, the headphones still deliver around 35 hours of playback, which is more than sufficient for long workdays, commutes, or travel. And if the battery does run low, a quick 5-minute charge provides about 5 hours of additional listening time, ensuring you’re rarely stuck without sound.</p>


<p data-start="2654" data-end="3000">Comfort is equally important for long sessions, and Nothing has put real thought into the design. The ear cushions are made from memory foam wrapped in PU material, which resists oils and makeup to stay clean over time. The reinforced aluminum core adds durability while keeping the headphones lightweight, making them suitable for extended wear.</p>
<p data-start="3002" data-end="3186" data-is-last-node="" data-is-only-node=""><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6042/">For a limited time, you can grab the Nothing headphones at a $60 discount on Amazon.</a> With them, you get style, comfort, and premium noise cancellation in one package. Makes for a great gift for any music lover this holiday season.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Portable Gaming Monitor (FHD, 15″, IPS) Hits Rock Bottom, Amazon Offloads Stock at New Record Low]]></title>
            <link>https://kotaku.com/portable-gaming-monitor-fhd-15-ips-hits-rock-bottom-amazon-offloads-stock-at-new-record-low-2000648418</link>
            <guid>1367395</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Portable monitors solve specific problems that laptops and tablets cannot address alone, particularly for gaming scenarios where you want larger screen real estate without lugging full-size displays. Nintendo Switch players confined to the 7/8-inch handheld screen gain dramatic improvement through 15.6-inch external displays that transform mobile gaming into living room experiences during travel or temporary setups.</p>
<p>The <em>KYY</em> <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4362/">15-6-inch portable monitor costs $66 during Black Friday on Amazon, down from $99</a>, and hits a record-low price that undercuts competing 1080p portable displays typically selling between $80 and $120 for identical specifications. The 34% discount makes <strong>secondary displays accessible</strong> at pricing approaching basic phone accessories.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4362/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Full HD IPS Display That Works</h2>
<p>The <strong>15.6-inch IPS panel with a resolution of 1920 x 1080</strong> makes images clear and readable, and games show sharp detail instead of the blurry compromises that lower-resolution portable monitors make. When you look at the screen from the side or share it with others,<strong> the 178-degree viewing angles keep the colors and contrast true</strong>. What’s more, HDR support improves the dynamic range of compatible content by showing more detail in shadows in dark scenes and keeping highlight information that SDR displays clip.</p>



<p>The <strong>two USB-C ports with full functionality</strong> let you connect a single cable to a laptop or phone that supports DisplayPort Alt Mode and Power Delivery. You don’t need separate power adapters or HDMI converters that make cable clutter to connect modern MacBooks, Windows laptops and flagship smartphones: They all work with simple USB-C cables. The <strong>Mini-HDMI port</strong> works with devices that don’t have USB-C video output, like gaming consoles, older laptops, and desktop computers.</p>
<p>The monitor is truly portable because <strong>it is only 0.3 inches thick and weighs only 1.7 pounds</strong>. The dimensions fit into laptop bags with other gear without needing special carrying cases or taking up too much room in luggage while traveling. Business travelers get presentation screens for working in hotel rooms, digital nomads set up dual-monitor workstations in cafes or coworking spaces, and students use laptop screens to do research-heavy assignments that need multiple document windows.</p>
<p>The <strong>included smart cover is made of PU leather and protects against scratches</strong> while being transported.The magnetic attachment makes it easier to attach and remove the cover than cases that need straps or closures, and the frameless design keeps it as small as possible. The grooves in the stand make it easy to find a comfortable viewing angle, whether you’re typing on a laptop or watching something hands-free.</p>



<p>The built-in dual stereo speakers let you listen to music without headphones or external speakers, but the sound quality is only okay because of physical limitations. The <strong>3.5mm audio jack lets you connect headphones</strong> or external speakers when you need better sound, but it also keeps things flexible for different uses. When sound quality isn’t as important as convenience, the speakers are good enough for video calls, watching videos, or playing games.</p>
<p>The <strong>landscape and portrait orientation support lets you work in different ways</strong> such as coding with vertical text display, reviewing documents in their native orientation, or editing portrait photos. You can change the brightness, contrast, color temperature, and input selection on the screen without having to use software or complicated button combinations.</p>
<p>The Black Friday price of $66 is the lowest ever, which means that KYY’s portable monitor costs a lot less than other 1080p displays that cost between $80 and $120 and have similar specs and build quality.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/take-34-off-the-sony-srs-xb100s-speaker-that-brings-life-to-your-favorite-music-2000648189</link>

              <p>If you’re looking to enjoy your favorite tracks on the go, having a solid portable Bluetooth speaker is a must. The market is filled with a ton of options, so picking the right one for yourself can get overwhelming fast, but that’s where we come in. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6040/">Our shopping team has been working hard to find the best Black Friday discounts out there, and those looking for something under $50 should consider grabbing the Sony SRS-XB100 speaker.</a></p>
<p>It’s now down to $43, after a whopping 34% discount. Multiple color options are discounted, including black, white, and the stunning orange. Keep in mind that Black Friday discounts move fast, so if you spot something you like, it’s best to grab it sooner rather than later.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6040/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Powerful Sound on the Go</h2>
<p>The super-portable XB100 features a basic, no-fuss design and comes with an engineered strap that makes it quite easy to travel with. Wrap it around your arm, attach it to your backpack, or toss it into a cupholder and get going. Don’t let the size fool you, though.&nbsp;The improved driver, paired with a full-range speaker, enhances low-end tones while boosting the bass. Sound is spread across the room with the Sound Diffusion processor, creating a cinema-like, 3D listening experience. Vibing to the latest Coldplay album or just catching up on your favorite audiobook as you finish boring kitchen tasks, audio comes through with great detail and clarity. When streaming movies, you’ll be able to hear dialogues just as well, making it an all-rounder.</p>
<p>There’s a built-in microphone that lets you take calls directly from the speaker, absolutely hands-free. The echo-canceling technology, as the name suggests, removes echo from your calls, meaning the other person won’t hear their own voice coming back. Catch up with friends, and take quick meetings on the go right from it.</p>



<p>An IP67 rating makes the speaker resistant to both dust and water, while a new UV coating prevents it from harsh sunlight. This year-round durability makes it easy to carry it with you anywhere you want, literally. Take it to a fun beach trip with friends, by the pool on a hot, sunny day, and even in the shower for a private jamming session with the songs you’d rather gatekeep. The sound is pretty solid on its own, but you can always pair two of these for a larger, more immersive setup. Just ask a friend to bring theirs, and have your very own mini concert right there in your backyard.</p>
<p>Battery life is just as solid. You’re looking at around 16 hours of playtime on a single charge, which is enough to go at least a couple of days without plugging it in.
