              <p>As is by now traditional, the <a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-presents-winds-waves-pikachu-underwater-2000674398">initial announcement of the existence of <em>Pokémon Winds</em> And <em>Waves</em></a> was accompanied by the reveal of the three new starter Pokémon that trainers will be able to choose from at the beginning of the game, and by extension the first three Pokémon revealed as part of Gen X. They are Browt, Pombon and Gecqua. Let’s meet ’em.</p> <h2>Browt</h2> <figure id="attachment_2000674445" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000674445"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000674445">© The Pokémon Company</figcaption></figure> <p>First up is Browt, an owl-ish baby bird with big eyebrows. Just imagine the long nights spent trying to figure out that name. It’s the Grass-type starter, described as a Bean Chick Pokémon, and we already have its vital stats:</p> <p>Height: 1′ (0.3m)<br> Weight: 7.7lb (3.5KG)<br> Ability: Overgrow</p> <p>It does seem a bit odd that the game’s gone back to owls as a starter inspiration, given Rowlet was only three generations ago. Although this might be more bizarre design choice than actual species, given it’s described as a “chick.” Given the leaf-like brows on the beast, we can assume it’ll lean into those Bulbasaur-like planty attacks.</p>

 <h2>Pombon</h2> <figure id="attachment_2000674443" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000674443"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000674443">© The Pokémon Company</figcaption></figure> <p>This fluffy pup is yet another dog-like pocket monster, although the first time one’s been a starter. It’s the Fire-type for the set, and classified as a Puppy Pokémon. Its stats are:</p> <p>Height: 1’4 (0.4m)<br> Weight: 14.8lb (4.3KG)<br> Ability: Blaze</p> <p>There’s not a lot more to discern about this little doggo, other than its obvious inspiration by a Pomeranian. It’ll be interesting to see if it stays cute as it grows, or if things head in a more wolf-like direction.</p>

 <h2>Gecqua</h2> <figure id="attachment_2000674444" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000674444"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000674444">© The Pokémon Company</figcaption></figure> <p>Hardest to spell is Gecqua, who we can infer from the name alone is an aquatic gecko. Water-type, of course, and with its huge eyes my immediate favorite of the three, with the unimaginative category of Water Gecko Pokémon. Stats are:</p> <p>Height: 1′ (0.3m)<br> Weight: 9.5lb (4.3KG)<br> Ability: Torrent</p> <p>It was only Gen VIII that we last saw a reptilian starter, and a Water-type to boot, with Sobble. And given the visual similarity between the two, especially when you think about Sobble’s final form, Inteleon, it’s another oddly overlapping design. Still though, Gecqua is completely adorable and is already my pick.</p>

 <hr> <p>So, who stands out to you? Have you already fallen in love? Or are you just bemused that Game Freak couldn’t think of any other species to be inspired by for the new starters?</p>

              <p>Amazon has started production on its live-action <em>God of War</em> series and <a href="https://press.amazonmgmstudios.com/us/en/press-release/prime-video-debuts-firstlook-image-of-ryan-hurst-a">released the first production photo online</a>. The photo features Kratos, played by Ryan Hurst, standing behind Atreus, played by Callum Vinson. And uh…it looks like a pre-taped <em>SNL</em> skit.</p> <p>On February 27, Amazon MGM Studios put out a press release announcing that filming on the long-in-development <em>God of War</em> live-action series had officially begun in Culver City, California. The series is being led by Ronald D. Moore, who is not only the live-action adaptation’s showrunner but also an executive producer and writer on the series. <a href="https://kotaku.com/god-of-war-amazon-show-cast-kratos-atreus-mimir-actor-2000666932">The series features Mandy Patinkin as Odin</a>, Ed Skrein as Baldur, Max Parker as Heimdall, Ólafur Darri Ólafsson as Thor, Teresa Palmer as Sif, Alastair Duncan as Mimir, Jeff Gulka as Sindri, and Danny Woodburn as Brok.</p>

 <p>To help get people excited about the series going into full production, Amazon shared the first photo from the set, giving us our first look at Kratos and his son Atreus in live-action. And my first reaction upon seeing it was to go “Oh…no…”</p> <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">Father and Son. Behold your first look at Kratos and Atreus in the God of War series now in production for <a href="https://twitter.com/PrimeVideo?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@PrimeVideo</a>. Their journey to the highest peak begins. <a href="https://t.co/vOkD1SiJ3q">pic.twitter.com/vOkD1SiJ3q</a></p> <p>— Amazon MGM Studios (@AmazonMGMStudio) <a href="https://twitter.com/AmazonMGMStudio/status/2027398333401088067?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">February 27, 2026</a></p></blockquote>  <p>Kratos, in particular, looks rough in live-action. In a game, his design can be exaggerated, but here he’s just a dude who looks like he’s cosplaying as his favorite dad warrior. Something about how pristine he looks, coupled with his pose here, just has big “SNL host doing a pre-recorded studio bit that isn’t very funny” energy. I don’t know. Perhaps Kratos’ oddball design is just not going to translate well to live-action TV.</p>

 <p>Atreus, on the other hand, looks fine, if not a tad out of place, standing next to Kratos as he takes on a pose and expression that looks like me while scanning for leftovers in the fridge at 2 in the morning.</p> <p>Ronald D. Moore is a very talented writer and showrunner. And Amazon is no doubt throwing as much money as needed at this show in an effort to make it a success. So perhaps this first image is just a bad tease of what could be something that I end up enjoying as much as the <a href="https://kotaku.com/fallout-season-two-review-amazon-more-episodes-bethesda-new-vegas-2000665533"><em>Fallout </em>show.</a> But for now, based on this first image, I’m nervous about the final product. <em>God of War</em> on Amazon has already been picked up for a second season. No release date for season one has been given. It is expected to arrive in early 2027.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Pokémon Winds And Waves Skipping Original Nintendo Switch]]></title>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Today, Nintendo and The Pokémon Company announced the next mainline entries in the long-running catch-’em-all franchise: <a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-presents-winds-waves-pikachu-underwater-2000674398"><em>Pokémon Winds</em> and </a><em><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-presents-winds-waves-pikachu-underwater-2000674398">Pokémon Waves</a>.</em> And for those hoping they’d be able to hold off on buying a Switch 2 for a bit longer, I’ve got bad news. The 10th generation of <em>Pokémon</em> games are ditching the original Switch.</p> <p>On February 27, perhaps to avoid some confusion, <a href="https://x.com/Pokemon/status/2027394547756548460">the official Pokémon account tweeted out</a> that the tropical-based <em>Waves</em> and <em>Winds</em> will only be playable on Switch 2 hardware when it launches in 2027.</p> <blockquote><p>“In <em>Pokémon Winds </em>and<em> Waves,</em> <strong>releasing exclusively on Nintendo Switch 2</strong>, you’ll travel across beautiful windswept islands and a vast ocean with glittering waves that ebb and flow. You’ll also team up with Pokémon to overcome challenges and even the forces of nature!”</p></blockquote> <p>As seen in the first trailer for the just-announced upcoming <em>Pokémon</em> games, <em>Winds</em> and <em>Waves</em> looks gorgeous, with higher-resolution textures and more detailed models than anything seen in the series before. That’s great, <a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-legends-z-a-switch-2-graphics-ugly-art-style-1851767088">as <em>Pokémon</em> games have started to show their age in recent years</a> due to Switch 1’s lack of power compared to most other consoles. Ditching that machine and focusing exclusively on Switch 2 has seemingly freed up developers at GameFreak in a big way. But that comes at a cost.</p>

  <p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/02/nintendo-switch-hardware-sales-pass-150-million-with-ps2s-record-still-a-way-off">Nintendo has sold over 150 million original Switch consoles</a>. And now, anyone who owns an OG Switch and loves <em>Pokémon</em> but hasn’t upgraded to the new console might be left behind. Under the tweet confirming the news that the game is Switch 2 exclusive, you’ll find plenty of people cheering this decision. But sprinkled throughout the replies are people frustrated and sad that <em>Pokémon</em>&nbsp;<em>Winds </em>and<em> Waves</em> is leaving them behind. Anecdotally, when I told some people the new game was Switch 2 only, they looked crestfallen. Sure, people have until 2027 to save up cash to buy a Switch 2, but that’s not easy or feasible for everyone.</p> <p>Then again, the Switch 2 is going to let GameFreak build a&nbsp;<span>truly modern-looking&nbsp;<em>Pokémon</em> game, and trying to get that to work on the old Switch would likely have been near-impossible</span>&nbsp;without big compromises. So, while I do feel for folks who are going to have to buy a new console to play the next entry in their favorite series, I think in the long term this was the right call, even though I’m a bit surprised, in a good way, that GameFreak and Nintendo were willing to ditch an install base of 150+ million consoles in the process.</p>
