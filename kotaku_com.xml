              <p>Losing track of your items, especially when you’re on the go, is never fun. AirTags are a great way to always keep an eye on the whereabouts of your essentials. But since most of us have more than one thing worth keeping tabs on, getting just a single AirTag might not cut it. Thankfully, Amazon is making it easier to snap a few without paying the full price.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3844/">Right now, the retailer is offering the Apple AirTag 4-Pack for just $65, which is a 34% discount from its original price.</a> That brings it down to around $16 per AirTag, which is practically a steal considering the peace of mind these bring. The deal is open to both Prime and non-Prime members, but we can’t say how long it will last. It’s best to get your orders in before it’s too late.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3844/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Multiple Ways to Track Your Essentials</h2>
<p>An AirTag is a coin-like gadget that you can attach to your essentials in multiple ways. You can use an AirTag accessory (like a keychain or loop) to hook it onto your keys or luggage, and even just slide one in your wallet or backpack. Activating these is quite straightforward; just remove the battery tab from the AirTag, bring it closer to your iPhone or iPad, and tap Connect on the prompt that appears. Follow the on-screen instructions to register the AirTag to your Apple ID, and you will be all set!</p>
<p>Once you’re done setting things up, you can use the Find My app to locate your essentials. The Precision Finding features lead you right to your nearby AirTag, and the app even lets you trigger a sound from the built-in speaker to help you find it. For items that are further away, the Find My network can help pinpoint their location anonymously.</p>



<p>Still can’t seem to find your valuables? You can also put an AirTag in Lost Mode, which sends you a notification as soon as it detects the AirTag. You can even share the tag with up to five people, or provide its details to a third party (like an airline) to help recover lost luggage.</p>
<p>The replaceable battery lasts up to a year. AirTags are also IP67 water and dust-resistant, meaning these tiny but mighty gadgets can survive not-so-ideal weather conditions well. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3844/">This deal brings the price down of this 4-pack bundle to just $65, after a nice $34 discount, which makes the purchase much more affordable.</a></p>

            <title><![CDATA[Every Chase Card In Pokémon TCG’s Phantasmal Flames, Including That Charizard]]></title>
            <link>https://kotaku.com/pokemon-tcg-phantasmal-flames-charizard-chase-card-2000645074</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/every-chase-card-in-pok%C3%A9mon-tcg%E2%80%99s-phantasmal-flames-including-that-charizard.1356928/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>The latest set in the <a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-tcg-cards-available-journey-together-stock-1851772771">controversy-embroiled</a>&nbsp;<em>Pokémon TCG</em>, Phantasmal Flames, is now out. And, as is becoming traditional for a November release, contains a brand new Charizard card that’s going to drive even more people (and scalpers) to the hobby. In this case, it’s the beloved Mega Charizard X, the gigantic blue variant appearing in both a stunning Special Illustration Rare <em>and</em> in one of the new-fangled gold foils. And yes, both are already fetching ridiculous prices. But in a stark change, they’re the only two that are.</p> <p>I’m pleased to report that once again, if you’re actually able to find any packs to buy, Phantasmal Flames <a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-tcg-mega-evolution-pull-rates-2000629165">continues Mega Evolution’s new-found generosity</a> when it comes to pull rates. Of the 55 packs we were kindly sent by The Pokémon Company, I pulled an extraordinary 24 ex or better cards, of which 13 were full art or better. Compared to the three year run of <em>Scarlet &amp; Violet</em> sets, this is a dramatic improvement, with pretty much a 50:50 chance of not getting what is derogatively known as a “dud pack.” (For those wanting to play the game, there’s no such thing as a dud pack, and of course it’s these people who are most hurt by the current <a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-tcg-prismatic-evolutions-surging-sparks-sold-1851738920">year-long period of scarcity</a>.)</p>

 <p>However, the cost of this does very much appear to be the pull rates on Special Illustration Rares. As with Mega Evolution, Phantasmal Flames has made these most desirable cards extraordinarily unlikely to appear, with <a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-tcg-mega-evolution-gold-cards-pull-rate-2000630564">the new iteration of gold foils proving farcically rare</a>. With Mega Evolutions, this drove prices to new, all-time highs, but in the first few days of Phantasmal Flames things don’t appear to be nearly so out of control. The Charizards are, of course, outrageously priced at $600 and $800 each, but we then see a <em>massive</em> drop for third place, with Dawn’s SIR going for $60. That’s a&nbsp;<em>very</em> normal price for an SIR, and in a pretty small set with only five of them to find, it suggests that people are simply ripping packs for the Zards and caring about little else.</p>

 <p>That becomes even more stark when you notice that fourth place goes to Mega Charizard X ex again, but this time in its much more common Ultra Rare form (I pulled one of these, as it happens) at around $57, the other four SIRs following for as little as $30. (Yes, $30 for a piece of cardboard remains ridiculous, but then I just spent&nbsp;<em>way</em> more than that on the Crown Zenith Leafeon VSTAR, so who am I to talk?)</p>

 <p>Is this a good sign that cards like the Mega Sharpedo ex and Rotom ex SIRs aren’t going for megabucks? Or is it, and I do worry it’s this, that the SIRs in Phantasmal Flames just aren’t that appealing? The art is wonderful on both of those examples, but Sharpedo is rarely at the top of anyone’s favorite Pokémon list, and there really are a lot of pretty Rotom cards already. Then there’s the complete mess of the Mega Lopunny ex (see the card in the gallery), and, well, that’s all of them. The more common (and thus always cheaper) Illustration Rares are where the truly wonderful art appears in this set, with a stunning Zacian, Piplup, Flygon, Wooper, Togedemaru, Ludicolo and Ambipom to find, most of them selling during the peak price of the opening week for under $10! Meowth is the only one of the IRs that’s caught on at around $30 (with Piplup managing an impressive $19).</p> <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-tcg-mega-evolution-cards-price-mega-lucario-gardevoir-hyper-rare-2000633650">Compare this with Mega Evolution</a>, where the tenth highest priced card was going for $50, and the SIRs fetching around $300 each, and it’s a striking shift. So, with all that said, click on for the cards you want to chase if you’re looking for value in Phantasmal Flames, but know that if you’re after the cards to play in a deck, most can be picked up in their basic form for under a dollar. (Even Mega Charizard X ex’s regular form “only” fetches about $5.) Again,&nbsp;<em>if</em> you can actually find packs to open.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/sandisk-2tb-ssd-falls-to-new-all-time-low-amazon-wants-all-stock-gone-for-black-friday-2000645154</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/sandisk-2tb-ssd-falls-to-new-all-time-low-amazon-wants-all-stock-gone-for-black-friday.1356925/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>External hard drives (HDD) crawl along at speeds that turn simple file transfers into boring experiences, maxing out around 120MB/s for spinning platters. Solid-state drives (SSDs) eliminate mechanical parts entirely, using flash memory that reads and writes data at speeds ten times faster than traditional HDDs.</p>
<p>The SanDisk 2TB Extreme portable SSD delivers <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4826/">NVMe performance in a pocket-sized package, now sitting at $162 instead of the usual $209 price tag.</a> This marks an <strong>all-time low</strong> for this capacity, with Amazon wanting to clear inventory before Black Friday ends.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4826/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>1,050MB/s Read Speeds</h2>
<p>This SanDisk SSD pushes <strong>read speeds up to 1,050MB/s and write speeds of about 1,000MB/s over its USB 3.2 Gen 2 connection</strong>. These numbers are indicative of real performance you can expect to see in the real world when transferring files, not some theoretical maximum that never materializes. A 4K movie file of roughly 25GB copies in about 25 seconds and that same transfer takes over three minutes on external hard drives.</p>
<p>Inside the drive,<strong> NVMe technology delivers this performance by using direct PCIe lanes</strong> rather than the SATA bottleneck that constrains older SSDs. The controller manages data efficiently, maintaining consistent speeds even during sustained transfers that would cause cheaper drives to throttle. This you’ll notice most when backing up large folders or copying entire game libraries, as the speeds keep steady rather than starting fast and degrading over time.</p>



<p>Two terabytes stores around <strong>500 hours of 1080p video, 200,000 high-resolution photos, or 20 modern AAA game installs</strong>. This tier makes sense for video editors who are working with 4K footage, photographers who have large RAW libraries they’re managing, and gamers who simply refuse to uninstall old titles. The drive serves as a Time Machine backup target for Mac users or a Windows backup destination and SSD speeds mean your automated backups will finish faster without stressing your system. External game storage works flawlessly with both the PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series consoles, from storing games on the drive to <strong>playing titles directly from it</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>IP65 water and dust resistance</strong> means complete dust ingress protection and protection against water jets from any direction. The rating means the drive survives rain exposure, dusty environments, or even an accidental spill without immediately destroying your data. You can casually throw it in a backpack with water bottles, do shoots outdoors, or work in construction sites without constant anxiety about the environmental damage it may cause.</p>



<p>The USB-C connectivity works with modern laptops, tablets, and phones via the<strong> provided USB-C to USB-C cable</strong>. A USB-C to USB-A adapter is included in the box to connect to older computers that have traditional USB ports. The drive pulls its power directly from the USB connection with no need for separate power adapters, which keeps true plug-and-play simplicity across devices.</p>
<p>The drives come formatted as exFAT, which works<strong> universally across Windows, Mac, and Linux without reformatting</strong>. You can reformat to NTFS for Windows-specific use or APFS for Mac-optimized performance if the need calls for it. Operating temperature ranges from 0°C to 45°C during active use, covering most environments you’d realistically use the drive in. Non-operating storage tolerance goes from -20°C to 85°C.</p>
<p>You’re paying here about $0.08 per gigabyte at $162 for real NVMe speeds and a rugged build. Samsung, Crucial, and WD portable SSDs with similar specifications often sell between $200 and $300.</p>
