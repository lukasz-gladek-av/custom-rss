              <p>Black Friday is still a week away, but you don’t have to wait for the main event to start saving. Plenty of early deals are live across a wide range of categories at almost all big retailers, which also makes it a great time to grab some premium laptops for less.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5690/">We just spotted the 15-inch Lenovo IdeaPad Slim 3 going for $650 on Amazon, after 35% off its retail price of $999</a>. It’s a powerful and reliable option for both everyday work and play, but the offer is only around for a short time. Act fast before the price shoots back up. There’s no telling if the discount will be back for the main sale event, or if the stock will last till then.</p>

<h2>Spacious Display for Immersive Visuals</h2>
<p>It’s a slim laptop, but the build quality is seriously impressive. The military-grade, durable build protects it from everyday wear and tear well, while also keeping it lightweight enough to carry around with you on the go. Open it up and you’re greeted with a nice 15.3-inch WUXGA display that’s both bright and spacious. Visuals stay clean and sharp for all your content, plus the anti-glare coating keeps reflections at bay. You can use the screen comfortably in both bright and dim settings.</p>
<p>The full-size numeric keyboard makes typing long documents a breeze. It’s not backlit, but since the screen is quite bright, you won’t really have a problem using it after the shadows fall. The machine’s also got a high-quality 720p HD camera paired with an integrated digital microphone for crisp video calls. You will look your best and be heard properly, too.</p>



<p>Performance-wise, the laptop runs on an efficient <strong>AMD Ryzen 5 7535HS processor</strong> that can handle all your everyday tasks like a pro. The <strong>24GB DDR5 SDRAM</strong> lets you multitask without slowing down, and the <strong>built-in 1TB SSD</strong> makes it easy to store all your work documents, media content, programs, and even games at a single place.</p>
<p>Connectivity options include Wi-Fi 6, Bluetooth 5.3, plus a whole bunch of ports, including two USB-A (USB 5Gbps / USB 3.2 Gen 1), one USB-C (USB 5Gbps / USB 3.2 Gen 1), with USB PD 3.0 and DisplayPort 1.2, one HDMI 1.4, one Headphone/microphone combo jack (3.5mm), one SD card reader, and one Power connector. Windows 11 Pro also comes pre-installed, so the laptop will be ready to use right out of the box.</p>

              <p>I find the Entertainment Software Association’s (ESA) surveys weirdly depressing. Not because of their contents—they are in fact usually incredibly spiriting and positive—but because of how they are wholly ignored by the worldwide media in favor of reporting on video games as either a peculiar niche or a lethal scourge. Facts like how the average age of a games player is 41, demographics split almost 50:50 men and women, and 80 percent of people play games socially, go routinely ignored. The latest data you won’t be seeing recalled on your favorite morning news show is that a significant majority of children wish their parents would play video games <em>with</em> them. Oh, and also that they give them money to spend <em>in</em> them.</p> <p><a href="https://www.theesa.com/what-do-kids-want-for-holiday-gifts-video-games-of-course-they-also-want-their-parents-to-game-alongside-them/">This ESA latest holiday survey</a>, conducted with YouGov, spoke to 1,912 people aged 5 to 65, to find out what kids want to find under their tree this year. And, <a href="https://kotaku.com/video-game-esa-report-digital-currency-vbucks-christmas-1851049230">like in 2023</a>, it found that most kids want video games and video game-related currency. 58 percent of children are putting games on their wish list, meaning games are the third most popular desire after money and gift cards (69 percent) and clothing or accessories (63 percent). And as we’ve seen previously, it’s primarily not a new physical game that kids are after, but rather in-game currency.</p>

 <p>43 percent will be asking for money to spend in a game they already own (be it Vbux, Robux, G-tag Shinies, etc), compared to 39 percent who are after a new console, and just 37 percent looking for a new physical game. 32 percent, meanwhile, are looking for an in-game subscription.</p>

 <p>The boy/girl split has become far more stark in 2025, however. This year 76 percent of boys aged 5 to 17 want something video game-related, while only 39 percent of girls have it on their letter to Santa. In <a href="https://www.theesa.com/u-s-children-say-they-want-video-games-more-than-anything-else-this-holiday-season/">2023</a> it was 59 percent of girls. In <a href="https://www.theesa.com/video-games-top-kids-wish-lists-this-holiday-season/">2024</a> it was 67 percent. So what on Earth has happened in the last year to see that number plummet? Well, the best explanation I can find is that this year’s survey has expanded its age range to include 5 to 9-year-olds as well, and perhaps younger girls are less interested and so skewing the numbers.</p>

 <p>But what stands out most to me is the data that more than half of children say they want to play more video games with their parents. 58 percent, in fact. Obviously those numbers drop off significantly as kids get older, but among 5 to 7-year-olds, an astonishing 73 percent say they want their parents to play alongside them more. It’s still 66 percent aged 8 to 9, and 62 percent for kids aged 10 to 12. (The ESA doesn’t include 12 to 17 numbers, so we can assume it sharply drops off at that point in order to get the overall figure down to 58 percent.)</p>

 <p>Play games with your kids! They want you to! Not only is it the most effective way of negating harm—being able to help moderate mood, better control screen time, and intervene when online issues arise—but it’s a wonderful way to bond. Sure,&nbsp;<em>Minecraft</em> might not be your number one choice of game to play, but let them bring you in, show you their builds, challenge them to some PvP, suggest going on a diamond hunt, or have a house-building competition. Yes, you may suck at&nbsp;<em>Fortnite</em>, but play in Duos and let them teach you, revive you, and put the blame on you when you lose in third place. Even just using the app to stream what they’re playing in VR to your phone can make that a shared experience, kids delighted to have you discover the otherwise secret worlds.</p> <p>The ESA is obviously a biased source, given it’s a trade association for the industry, the cause of E3, and indeed <a href="https://kotaku.com/classic-games-history-foundation-preservation-yakuza-1850623857">a regressive force against games preservation</a>, but its surveys do tend to be based on solid data. Data I wish the broader media would bother reading.</p>

              <p>Star Wars is the absolute number one licensed franchise for LEGO and the <strong>Millennium Falcon remains their best-selling model</strong>, year after year. Fans continue to return to Han Solo’s iconic ship because it encapsulates everything they love about the saga. This <em>25th Anniversary</em> edition captures the vessel as it appeared in <em>A New Hope</em> and gives you the chance to own a piece of Star Wars history without breaking the bank: Amazon <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4190/">has cut the price to $67, down from its usual $84, and marks an all-time low for Black Friday</a>.</p>

<h2>
Build Your Way Into the Star Wars Universe</h2>
<p>Get ready to embark on a construction journey through one of cinema’s most recognizable spacecraft with this <strong>921-piece set</strong>. The build process reproduces the signature features of the Falcon in LEGO form: from the forward-facing <strong>cockpit that Han and Chewie piloted</strong> through asteroid fields and Imperial blockades, to the circular satellite dish resting atop the hull and quad laser cannons positioned for defense</p>
<p>In this way, the included display stand elevates this model beyond a simple toy into proper home décor. Lego designed it to angle the Falcon in such a way that creates visual interest from any viewing position in your room.<strong> A nameplate identifies the ship</strong>&nbsp;and a special 25th Anniversary brick commemorates a quarter-century of Lego Star Wars collaboration. The stand keeps your completed model stable and secure, while showing it off at an eye-catching tilt.</p>



<p>This Millennium Falcon belongs to LEGO’s Starship Collection, a curated series of mid-scale vehicles from across the Star Wars timeline. The scale hits a sweet spot between the massive Ultimate Collector Series models that demand entire shelves and the smaller sets that lack display presence. <strong>At 9.5 inches long, 7.5 inches wide, and 5 inches high</strong>, this Falcon commands attention without dominating your available space.</p>



<p>The build itself is what LEGO refers to as a mindful creative experience designed for adults. Each bag of pieces corresponds to a specific section of the ship, allowing you to tackle the project in manageable sessions after work or on weekends. The instruction manual will walk you through techniques that interlock bricks in satisfying ways, and to watch the Falcon take shape piece by piece delivers that therapeutic flow state that builders chase.</p>
<p>Being a 25th Anniversary edition, this set celebrates the partnership that started in 1999 between Lego and <em>Lucasfilm</em>, which revolutionized both brands. This special commemorative brick is included for display, making your model part of the limited celebration. Anniversary editions are highly regarded by collectors as a milestone in the timeline of Lego and represent both the enduring popularity of the franchise and a specific moment in collecting history.</p>
<p>At $67 for 921 pieces, you’re paying roughly <strong>seven cents per brick</strong> which is well below the typical ten-cent average for licensed Lego sets. The all-time low price turns an already reasonable set into an exceptional value. Black Friday pricing rarely hits Star Wars sets this hard, so snagging the Falcon now means you’re securing both a satisfying building project and a conversation.</p>
