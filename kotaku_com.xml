            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div> <p>Popular comedy streaming service and website Dropout, formerly known as College Humor, has become more and more famous online thanks in large part to <a href="https://kotaku.com/game-changer-deja-vu-video-game-dropout-tv-1851449932">its hit show <em>Game Changer</em></a><em>. </em>The series, hosted by Dropout CEO Sam Reich, features comedians playing different, <a href="https://x.com/samreich/status/1953123165384917352">often complex, devious, and hilarious games</a> each episode. It’s a great concept for a show, and I wondered if Dropout would ever make a video game version of its viral sensation. The answer: Yeah, probably!</p> <p>I recently sat down and chatted with Reich as part of a larger interview about <em>Game Change</em>r and how the different games are designed, playtested, and balanced. And during that interview, which will be up at a later date, I had to ask if Reich and others at Dropout had ever contemplated a video game version of any of the streaming service’s shows.</p> <p>“Yeah, for sure,” said Reich during our Zoom interview. He clarified that it would likely be a game based on <a href="https://kotaku.com/the-internet-reacts-to-critical-roles-big-shakeup-2000614488"><em>Dimension 20,</em> the service’s super-popular D&amp;D series</a>, or one based on <em>Game Changer.&nbsp;</em></p> <p>“I think that we would be into that and we’ve talked about it,” explained the Dropout CEO and<em> Game Changer</em> host. “And I think it’s like, at this point, it’s honestly more than anything else, just like a bandwidth issue, which is if we’re going to do it, we want it to feel like us, which means we need to work on it. We’re not going to farm the IP out to some third party. We want it to feel personal. And it needs to be something, therefore, that we’re excited enough about and feels differentiated enough from what’s out there that it feels worth our time.”</p> <p><iframe loading="lazy" title="Game Changer Season 7 Trailer [Dropout Exclusive Series]" width="500" height="281" src="about:blank" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen="" data-rocket-lazyload="fitvidscompatible" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/1eu0nZh9rfw?feature=oembed"></iframe></p> <p>He also admitted that another big barrier to Dropout developing something is just how expensive games are to create and how long it takes to make them.</p> <p>When I asked if Reich had <em>really</em> thought about this much and had some ideas for a <em>Game Changer</em> game, or if it was just a far-off fantasy that might happen, he confirmed that they “definitely have ideas” of what a Dropout game would be, and they are working toward making one.</p> <p>“Part of wanting to develop more of that competency was releasing all of those <a href="https://kotaku.com/games/dejavu-by-dropout-dot-tv">little web games</a> [featured in <em>Game Changer</em>],” said Reich. “Let’s start dabbling, you know, and like, see if we can speak this language at all.”</p> <p>In our interview, Reich sounded very confident that a <em>Game Changer</em> game is coming…one day, adding: “So I would say we probably will do one. And it’s just a question of what and when.”</p> <p><em>Game Changer’</em>s season 7 finale airs exclusively on Dropout on August 11.</p> </div></div><br/><br/>https://kotaku.com/game-changer-dropout-video-game-sam-reich-interview-dimension-20-2000616708]]></content:encoded>

              <p>Originally released as part of <i>Metal Gear Solid 3: Subsistence</i>, an augmented version of <i>Snake Eater</i> that hit PS2 the following year, <i>Metal Gear Online</i> was a strange beast. The online take on <i>MGS</i>’ stealth gameplay would receive a few other iterations, with one accompanying <i>Metal Gear Solid 4</i>, another a part of the PSP titles <i>Portable Ops</i> and <i>Peace Walker</i>, and lastly with <i>Metal Gear Solid V: The Phantom Pain</i>. (Let’s not talk about <a href="https://kotaku.com/metal-gear-survive-the-kotaku-review-1823584276"><i>Survive</i></a>. It doesn’t count.) For me, <i>MGO</i> was at its best in the version that accompanied <i>MGS4</i>, but in all the iterations I played, <i>MGO</i> remained something special, a celebration of <i>MGS</i>’ tendency to be a little goofy and, of course, an engaging multiplayer stealth game when it (and the players) wanted it to be.</p> <p><i>MGO</i> arguably ushered in a new perspective for <i>Metal Gear</i> as it forced the series to adopt a now-standard moveable 3D camera that pivots around the character. Prior to its release, <i>MGS</i> used fixed camera angles, usually in a top-down or isometric perspective. That perspective wasn’t ideal for a multiplayer game. At the same time, <i>MGS</i> is far from a fast-paced shooter. It’s slower, encouraging a more methodical approach even if you’re responding to threats with lethal force. And that’s one aspect that made both traditional, single-player <i>MGS</i> and its online offshoots so special. Some modes of <i>MGO</i> encouraged a relatively hectic play style. Others, meanwhile, were almost entirely about stealth. Take “Sneaking MIssion,” in which one player would take on the role of Snake as he stealthfully tried to knock out and steal dog tags from other players. Trying to stay hidden from actual flesh-and-blood players offered a kind of thrill that was quite distinct from what you’d get in the single-player games.</p> <p><iframe loading="lazy" title="MGO2 PC (2023): SNEAKING MISSION WINS #1" src="about:blank" width="1227" height="690" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" data-rocket-lazyload="fitvidscompatible" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/e7f3K0eKi8c"></iframe></p> <p>Naturally, being a <i>Metal Gear </i>game, cardboard boxes, naughty magazines, exaggerated death screams, the ability to play as characters from the series, and more made the game feel like an appropriately absurd celebration of what so many of us love about these games. <i>MGS</i>’ charm was and is never about one singular thing. It’s the sum of all of its wildly eccentric parts. That carried through in the various online modes it received over the years. I mean, <a href="https://youtu.be/DRuouKk3TiY">just look at this nonsense</a>. Where else would you see something like this?</p>

 <p><iframe loading="lazy" title="Goodbye Metal Gear Online 2" src="about:blank" width="1227" height="690" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" data-rocket-lazyload="fitvidscompatible" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/DRuouKk3TiY"></iframe></p> <p>Modders have recently made incredible strides <a href="https://mgo2pc.com/">in their efforts</a> to <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqyQtjok9Qk">resurrect the <i>MGS4</i> iteration of <i>Metal Gear Online </i>on PC</a>, so this experience is not totally lost to time. And technically you can still play <i>MGSV</i>’s online mode, though every time I’ve tried recently, I spend more time waiting for a match than I do playing. I also never cared for its class-based character selection.</p> <p><i>Metal Gear Online</i> is due to return later this year though. “Fox Hunt” is expected to launch in the fall as a part of the upcoming remake of <i>MGS3</i>, <i>Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater</i>. Not a whole lot about this mode is known right now, though <a href="https://www.konami.com/mg/mgs3r/foxhunt/us/en/">the game’s dedicated page promises</a> “hide-and-seek based” gameplay “that utilizes the central elements of the base game–camouflage and survival.”</p> <p><i>MGO</i> was always a niche experience, of interest to only the most passionate of us <i>MGS</i> dorks. Hopefully Fox Hunt will provide new, quirky experiences that’ll satisfy this discerning crowd of stealth fans.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              
              <p>A software engineer who goes by Desimulate on X recently posted <a href="https://x.com/de5imulate/status/1947024682118488116">a five-second clip of AI-generated pixel art</a> that went viral. Think your favorite Instagram pixel artist recreating <em>Daggerfall</em> with wild parallax scrolling effects. It was such a hit on Elon Musk’s Grok-infested social media platform that Desimulate decided to try and actually make the game the five-second clip would be from. But he’s not using AI to do it. Why? “Well, right now, the tools aren’t really good enough.”</p> <p>That’s what he told Ryan K. Rigney in the latest edition of the <a href="https://www.pushtotalk.gg/p/behind-the-three-letter-tweet-that-pissed-off-the-entire-games-industry"><em>Push to Talk</em> newsletter</a>. Desimulate said the viral post was the result of working very closely with Midjourney, using lots of specific reference art to try and hone the outputs while also trying to spur them into generating something new. “I just got obsessed with making something unique, and that post was the epitome of that for me. And it kind of came out of nowhere,” he told Rigney.</p> <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="und" dir="ltr">omw <a href="https://t.co/eCiTOrjtzC">pic.twitter.com/eCiTOrjtzC</a></p> <p>— Desimulate (@de5imulate) <a href="https://twitter.com/de5imulate/status/1947024682118488116?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">July 20, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/microsoft-xbox-ai-clockwork-revolution-brian-fargo-inxile-2000616038">But while AI can generate a five-second clip</a>, it’s nowhere near being able to generate an actual game based on it, let alone one as ambitious as an open-world fantasy RPG with extremely detailed pixel art. “The meshes are probably good enough to make a basic game,” he explains. “Something small. But this is a game that is kind of demanding, right? It’s going to be a real fantasy RPG. So at the end of the day, it’s going to have to be performant. The 3D generation stuff right now…the meshes are just not up to snuff. They are way too many triangles, polygons, and a lot of them kind of get messed up. And so it actually ends up taking more time to clean them than it would to just, like, start from the beginning. So we just use it as a visual reference.”</p>

 <p>Desimulate is not a game developer. Neither am I. So I can’t tell you whether he’s making any sense. But I can tell you that he’s now trying to hire people who are game developers to turn his viral AI GIF into a game. I’ve encountered many a video game Kickstarter with vertical slices from people who have actually shipped games before that never came close to panning out. If I was a Polymarket guy, which I am definitely not, this is not the horse I’d be picking.</p> <p>But I do think the interview provides a fascinating and useful look into the allure of AI tools like Midjourney and what people think they’re doing when they work with them. It’s clear Desimulate feels like he has ownership over what the machine spit out, even though his contribution to it is a rounding error in the grand scheme of things like training data. Rigney asked why he’s the one to make the game imagined by the people upvoting his post. Here’s what he said:</p> <p>“I’ve got the vision, and everything starts with that vision. I’ve got the passion to make it happen. In two weeks, I’ve interviewed 40-plus people, brought a real team together of real game devs, started building, designing the game, and we’ve made a ton of progress. Obviously everything is in an R&amp;D state. But I am committed to making it happen.”</p>
