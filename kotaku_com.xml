Millions of Helldivers died liberating the autumnal planet from Terminid control beginning with  Operation Valiant Enclosure. Players only ever lost one battle there. But this week, it proved to be all for naught when <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qyCgEeXRZ5I&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qyCgEeXRZ5I" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>Helldivers</em> dungeon master Joel</a></span> decided to make it the first pawn to fall in a much more sinister game.</p><p>But it’s not the first time a planet was destroyed in <em>Helldivers 2</em>. Meridian was the first to fall, and not at the hands of outside forces. It was players who destroyed that planet last year by turning it into a black hole as a means toward eradicating a mutated Terminid Super Colony of their own unintentional making. It was the first example of Arrowhead Game Studios fundamentally altering its in-game cosmos in service of its grim military storytelling. And it’s not clear it was part of a grander plan. </p><p>Last weekend, players were given the Major Order to go contest the Illuminate’s control of the black hole, lest the aliens fuel it with dark energy for unknown purposes. “The Illuminate are now actively moving Meridia,” an in-game message informed players on February 8. “The Center of Science on Fenrir III can confirm: Meridia is in motion. The Dark Energy that the illuminate muster through their many invasions appears to be key. The Helldivers is [sic] now called upon to limit the Illuminate accumulation of this Dark Energy.”</p><p>It’s unclear how the black hole can be stopped but things will get very, very bad if it’s not. The anomaly is now on a collision course for Super Earth, with five other planets in the way. Plus, the more dark energy it accrues, the faster it moves. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/Helldivers/comments/1ii9dlw/dark_energy_accumulation/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Helldivers/comments/1ii9dlw/dark_energy_accumulation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Players had been tracking</a></span> it via in-game tools over the past week. How many more planets will fall before the Illuminate’s plan can be unraveled and halted? Or is Arrowhead planning to celebrate <em>Helldivers 2</em>'s one-year anniversary with a Super Earth showdown players have been waiting for?</p><p>Either way, it’s a testament to the game’s one-of-a-kind evolving online world that it feels like it’s building toward something despite all of the repetition and incremental progress. Players of the original <em>Helldivers</em> have won the Galactic War multiple times at this point, with each victory clearing the board ahead of a new campaign. I’m excited to see what Arrowhead’s long-term plans are with this sequel. It feels like <em>Helldivers 2</em> has room to continuing evolving, both mechanically and narratively, for years to come. </p><p>.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

When I saw that, my immediate thought was “Oh, so the people who wanted those back finally got what they wanted,” and then I mentally moved on to the next thing. </p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="195460" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="Overwatch 2's New Story Missions: Worth The Money?" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="122" data-playlist="195460,196880,196049" data-current="195460"><div><p>Overwatch 2's New Story Missions: Worth The Money?</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195460/195460_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195460/195460_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195460/195460_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195460/195460_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/20938.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>I forgot that if you hadn’t been paying attention to <em>Overwatch 2 </em>for several years, you might be confused as to why Blizzard would make this choice, much less <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://x.com/PlayOverwatch/status/1889741290394227102&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://x.com/PlayOverwatch/status/1889741290394227102" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">frame it as something worth celebrating</a></span>. It’s tied up in years of nostalgia toward the “way things used to be” in the original <em>Overwatch</em> and a dislike of <em>Overwatch 2</em>’s methods of monetization. The return of loot boxes doesn’t mean Blizzard is dismantling the expensive money dump entirely, but it is giving players a free option to <em>maybe</em> get the skins they want.</p><h3 id="h235"><a id=""></a><strong>Why did people want loot boxes back in <em>Overwatch 2</em>?</strong></h3><p>When <em>Overwatch 2 </em>launched, it completely reorganized how you unlock and purchase cosmetics. Blizzard added an in-game shop that rotates cosmetics in and out weekly that can be purchased with in-game currency and real-world money. Compare this to how you would unlock most things in the original <em>Overwatch</em>; you’d unlock a loot box with each level you gained and would hope and pray the skin you wanted was inside. You couldn’t control what you got from them, but the trade-off was that everything from skins to victory poses was obtainable for free. However, if you’re not so patient, you could also buy loot boxes with real money, which is how they get you. So there was an element of gambling involved.</p><p>By the time the original <em>Overwatch </em>was replaced by the sequel, I had unlocked so many cosmetics that opening the free loot boxes I’d gotten was a waste of time because I was mostly finding duplicates. Sure, I probably spent a few bucks here and there trying to find something specific, but the monetary investment was nothing compared to what it’s cost me to buy new skins in <em>Overwatch 2</em>’s store.</p><p>That’s part of why fans have been asking for a return to loot boxes. They’re pretty much a gambling mechanic that incentivizes players to spend real money in hopes of finding their desired skin, but there was still an option to earn them for free. A dedicated player could get everything they wanted without paying a cent, but in <em>Overwatch 2</em> that Mercy or Kiriko skin you’ve been eyeing is locked behind a paywall, and probably costs a pretty penny.</p><p>It’s easy to see how someone might yearn for the days when <em>Overwatch </em>wasn’t such a huge money investment on top of <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/overwatch-2-prereview-roundup-free-hero-shooter-grind-1849601813&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/overwatch-2-prereview-roundup-free-hero-shooter-grind-1849601813">being such a grind</a></span>, and it’s a pretty damning criticism of <em>Overwatch 2</em>’s expensive store that some people think gambling is the preferable approach. But looking at loot boxes in an <em>Overwatch</em>-shaped vacuum isn’t telling the whole story, which is why people who aren’t in the payload-pushing trenches are bewildered by the excitement.</p><h2 id="h236"><a id=""></a><strong>Are <em>Overwatch 2</em>’s loot boxes exploitative or just another means of progression?</strong></h2><p>Loot boxes have always been a controversial form of microtransaction in video games. Most gacha games use them in an inherently <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/loot-boxes-are-designed-to-exploit-us-1819457592&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/loot-boxes-are-designed-to-exploit-us-1819457592">exploitative way</a></span> because they require significant monetary or time investment with only a chance of getting the rewards you want. Such mystery packs have also been a centerpiece in <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/nintendo-class-action-lawsuit-loot-box-mario-kart-tour-1850462828&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/nintendo-class-action-lawsuit-loot-box-mario-kart-tour-1850462828">lawsuits</a></span> and <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/u-s-senator-introduces-bill-to-ban-loot-boxes-and-pay-1834612226&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/u-s-senator-introduces-bill-to-ban-loot-boxes-and-pay-1834612226">legislation</a></span> as parents and elected officials deem them a predatory business model. With all this baggage, it probably looks insane from the outside to see Blizzard tout their return and fans respond with excitement, eager to accept them with open arms. From the sound of it, however, Blizzard isn’t bringing them back in the same way, and the approach the team is taking this time around sounds less exploitative than what came before.</p><p>In an interview with <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.ign.com/articles/some-overwatch-fans-are-thrilled-loot-boxes-are-coming-back-some-not-so-much&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/some-overwatch-fans-are-thrilled-loot-boxes-are-coming-back-some-not-so-much" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>IGN</em></a></span>, <em>Overwatch 2 </em>director Aaron Keller confirmed that Loot Boxes will only be available on the battle pass and completing challenges, with no option to purchase them with real money. Keller also confirmed in an <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xRoM9B6vmhw&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xRoM9B6vmhw" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">interview with YouTuber emongg</a></span> that if you get a duplicate cosmetic, you can re-roll so you’re not wasting the limited loot boxes you can get per season. <em>Overwatch 2</em> has found so many ways to monetize things that were once free in the original that I’m surprised Blizzard didn’t try to monetize gambling on top of it, but considering the gambling aspect is so fraught that the U.S. government wants to get involved, this was probably the safer approach. Blizzard is also trying to be more transparent about what you might get by providing explicit drop rates so there’s less randomized mystery.</p><p>Ultimately, what Blizzard has described is less like the gambling we typically associate with loot boxes and more like a free form of progression that harkens back to the old days of <em>Overwatch</em>. As long as there isn’t any predatory option to pay for them with real cash, I don’t see the harm in giving people chance drops to earn old cosmetics that have rotated out of the shop. Reviving the little glowing chests that burst open with a celebratory fanfare is a nostalgia play just like the <em>Overwatch Classic </em>modes and bringing the old 6v6 format back. But in another timeline loot boxes could’ve been brought back exactly as they were, ready to rake in money from some poor Mercy main desperate to get the latest legendary skin.</p><p>Loot boxes will return in season 15 on February 18.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Find a cool sword that doesn’t quite fit your current build, but you want to play around with it later? Send it back to camp with a single button press. Stumble upon some valuable armor that is really heavy and will make you overencumbered, but you want to sell it later?  Well, just hit a button and send it back to your camp. You can do this anywhere with no restrictions and it’s awesome. Does it make sense? No, but the fact that I can even hold 10 swords in the first place doesn’t make sense either, so who cares?</p><p>The thing is, though, you might not even need to use this feature all that much because a lot of loot you find in <em>Avowed </em>doesn’t weigh anything. Consumable items—foods, potions, lockpicks—don’t weight anything. Likewise, crafting and upgrade materials—iron, wood, furs—also weigh nothing. I never, in my 40 hours or so with <em>Avowed</em>, left a dungeon  desperate to sell stuff in order to free up some inventory space. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/starfield-overencumbered-contraband-ship-parts-how-to-1850815667?_gl=1*29yk13*_ga*MzQzNjkwNDM2LjE2NDY2NjQ1NzQ.*_ga_V4QNJTT5L0*MTczOTQ2NjIwNS40NDMuMS4xNzM5NDY2ODM4LjU3LjAuMA..&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/starfield-overencumbered-contraband-ship-parts-how-to-1850815667?_gl=1*29yk13*_ga*MzQzNjkwNDM2LjE2NDY2NjQ1NzQ.*_ga_V4QNJTT5L0*MTczOTQ2NjIwNS40NDMuMS4xNzM5NDY2ODM4LjU3LjAuMA..">That’s a common occurrence in many RPGs</a></span>, but not <em>Avowed</em>.

It’s wonderful.</p><figure id="" data-id="cad8190ca65bfb41f76a32380ce16da7" data-recommend-id="image://cad8190ca65bfb41f76a32380ce16da7" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Obsidian / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="cad8190ca65bfb41f76a32380ce16da7" data-recommend-id="image://cad8190ca65bfb41f76a32380ce16da7" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Some might argue that this is too convenient and easy. I disagree. I think Obsidian correctly realized that managing stacks of crappy swords and pieces of iron isn’t much fun, nor is it what people want out of a roleplaying game. I want to fight monsters, meet new characters, explore strange lands and save the day. And <em>Avowed </em>focuses on all that stuff and doesn’t let inventory management get in the way.</p><p> I think more games should do that. Figure out what you want your game to be and the experience you want players to have while playing it. Then, once you understand that, cut anything that doesn’t help achieve that desired experience. Ultimately, sorting through forty pieces of iron isn’t why people play games like <em>Avowed</em>, so why make them do it?</p><p> .<br></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
