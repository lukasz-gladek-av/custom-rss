            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><span>Bethesda is celebrating the release of </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/fallout-s2-ep6-super-mutant-character-name-2000662226"><i><span>Fallout </span></i><span>season 2’s penultimate episode</span></a><span> by thoroughly upsetting the franchise’s online multiplayer fanbase. It just released the </span><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/4250650/Fallout_76_Mojave_Bundle/"><span>Mojave Bundle</span></a><span> for </span><i><span>Fallout 76</span></i><span>: a $30 DLC pack that features some nametags, a couple of items for your in-game camp, and the NCR Ranger Power Armor worn by Maximus in the previous episode. That’s half what the entire game cost back when it launched in 2018.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>Those who stuck with </span><i><span>Fallout 76 </span></i><span>throughout its many highs and lows </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/bethesda-zenimax-fallout-76-crunch-development-1849033233"><span>in the aftermath of its very rough launch in 2018</span></a><span> aren’t impressed. The decision to lock the cool new Power Armor design behind such a pricey one-off payment has been made worse by the fact that you can’t even purchase it through the in-game microtransaction store, the Atomic Shop.</span></p>

 <p><span>That means that if you’ve been saving up your Atoms, the premium currency used to purchase items, either by completing daily and weekly challenges or by slowly accruing them through your monthly $13 Fallout 1st subscription, you’ll still have to shell out an extra $30 just to get this fancy-looking skin. All of <em>Fallout 76</em>‘s seasonal updates are free, but that’s not making it any easier to swallow for some fans.&nbsp;</span></p> <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">This is CRAZY. They love making you pay a stupid amount of money for NCR stuff. <a href="https://t.co/gfqLCuUSaR">https://t.co/gfqLCuUSaR</a> <a href="https://t.co/aXgFIYhmct">pic.twitter.com/aXgFIYhmct</a></p> <p>— RyGuy (@rydirium) <a href="https://twitter.com/rydirium/status/2016932831084114052?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 29, 2026</a></p></blockquote>  <p><span>“I can’t stay silent about how aggressively cash-grabby Bethesda has become since Microsoft acquired them,” reads </span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/1qqhysl/yeah_the_price_of_the_mojave_bundle_is_ridiculous/"><span>one post</span></a><span> over on the </span><i><span>Fallout 76 </span></i><span>subreddit. “But what makes it even worse is that the game is still full of bugs and issues that haven’t been properly addressed. Clearly, Bethesda’s focus isn’t on fixing the game or delivering a solid experience anymore – they’re just trying to squeeze every cent out of players.”</span></p>

 <p><span>As </span><a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/fallout/fallout-76-is-free-to-play-until-feb-5-but-if-you-want-that-sick-ncr-power-armor-from-the-fallout-show-its-gonna-cost-you/"><i><span>PC Gamer</span></i></a><span> pointed out, you can currently buy every single mainline </span><i><span>Fallout</span></i><span> game, from the OG </span><i><span>Fallout</span></i><span>&nbsp;all the way up to </span><i><span>Fallout 4</span></i><span> (and even </span><i><span>Fallout 76</span></i><span> itself), for less than the price of the Mojave Bundle. The fact that players who have been grinding for Atoms don’t even get a discount makes it even worse.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><span>Meanwhile, </span><i><span>Fallout 76</span></i><span> itself has been on a week-long free trial and is currently on sale for just $8. It’s almost like the $30 power armor is Bethesda trying to make it up on the back end. Genuinely impressive that they’ve managed to make Amazon look borderline charitable by comparison, considering they just dropped the first season of </span><i><span>Fallout </span></i><span>on YouTube </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/fallout-season-1-free-to-watch-youtube-prime-2000664098"><span>for free</span></a><span>.</span></p>

            <title><![CDATA[Highguard Devs Make A Big Change As Player Count Nosedives]]></title>
            <link>https://kotaku.com/highguard-big-update-free-shooter-future-patch-notes-wildlight-2000664584</link>
            <guid>1421422</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>After launching on January 26, <em>Highguard</em> has struggled to keep players, according to data on SteamDB. But <a href="https://kotaku.com/highguards-patch-note-fov-ps5-crash-pc-optimization-2000664201">Wildlight isn’t giving up on the free-to-play raid shooter</a>, and has announced a big<strong>&nbsp;</strong>change for the game: a 5v5 mode.</p> <p>On Friday, Wildlight’s studio head and game director Chan Grenier <a href="https://x.com/ChadGrenier/status/2017271635712352533">teased on Twitter that a “big update”</a> about <em>Highguard</em> was coming, adding “You’ll want to see this one.” About four hours later, after some delay, that update arrived, and it was indeed a biggie. For a limited time, Highguard will offer players a 5v5 mode, a big shift from the game’s 3v3 mode, which many had criticized for being too small and sweaty.</p> <p>“We heard the feedback,” <a href="https://x.com/PlayHighguard/status/2017334052865658987">posted the official <em>Highguard</em> account</a>. “For the weekend, we are experimenting with a 5v5 Raid Mode. This is a separate playlist and not meant to replace 3’s. 3v3 Raids are still there for people who enjoy it! The lobby has been updated to allow for parties of 5 while the mode is live.”</p>

 <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">You asked, we listened</p> <p>All-new 5v5 limited time mode, playable now! ⚔️ <a href="https://t.co/wBaFZUOCeZ">pic.twitter.com/wBaFZUOCeZ</a></p> <p>— Highguard | LIVE NOW! (@PlayHighguard) <a href="https://twitter.com/PlayHighguard/status/2017333024598221040?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 30, 2026</a></p></blockquote>  <p>The new mode was added as part of a patch that is live now on consoles and PC. 5v5 will only be around for the weekend, for now, and Wildlight warns that adding more players could lead to some performance issues. Still, I’m excited to give <em>Highguard</em> another shot to see if a few more players in the game’s big empty maps could help add some excitement and take some pressure off players having to perform perfectly during team fights.</p> <p>The conversation around <em>Highguard</em> has been a mess ever since it was announced via the final teaser at the <a href="https://kotaku.com/highguard-game-awards-trailer-rust-hero-shooter-interview-2000663137">2025 Game Awards in December</a>. That trailer failed to excite people online, and a period of radio silence afterward left a big void that was filled by angry commentators, confused gamers, lots of blogs, and random takes from users on sites like Reddit and BlueSky. When it finally arrived earlier this week, it saw a huge influx of curious onlookers, nearly reaching 100k concurrent players according to SteamDB data. But just a few days later, <em>Highguard’s</em> playercount has dwindled as <a href="https://kotaku.com/highguard-already-has-over-7000-negative-reviews-on-steam-2000663220">negative reviews continue to flood the game’s Steam page</a>.</p>

 <p>Will this big change be enough to turn things around, or is <em>Highguard</em> doomed to become another flop in a long line of live-service games that have failed to survive? I’m not sure, but at the very least, it seems Wildlight Entertainment is willing to make big changes to the game to try and keep it around.</p>

Pedro Pascal, who plays Joel in the show, was one of the first of her co-stars to publicly pay tribute after O’Hara’s passing, sharing a lovely photo and calling the comic star a “genius” who he was grateful to be near.</span></p>   <p><span>Since her storied career spanned decades, O’Hara’s fans have many touchstones to think back on, whether that be her presence on the beloved Canadian sketch comedy show </span><i><span>SCTV </span></i><span>early in her career or some of her voice acting roles, such as Sally from </span><i><span>The Nightmare Before Christmas</span></i><span>. When news broke, fans immediately started flooding the internet with tributes, condolences, and jokes about how the wrong </span><i><span>Home Alone 2 </span></i><span>star died.</span></p>
