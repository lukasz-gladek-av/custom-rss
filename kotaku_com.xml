Athragar is the cheapest, so I recommend visiting him if you want to save a few gold for a pint at Chorrol’s The Grey Mare.</p><p>Alongside the Bound Sword, all three vendors also sell: Bound Bow, Bound Cuirass, Bound Mace, and Bound Shield. If you’re leaning into the Conjuration school of magic, save up your gold and buy all of them, then equip each to your quickslot wheel.

It’s also one that has had a mixed reputation over multiple entries. I groan and grumble every time I unintentionally activate it; but using it correctly with the right weapons and skills feels amazing.</p><h2 id="h200644"><a id=""></a>How does Sliding work?</h2><p>There are quite a few ways to activate this maneuver. <strong>The most common way to make your hunter slide is by running or rolling down a steep slope.</strong> While running downhill, <strong>take notice when the hunter’s animation changes to them trying to straighten their body out.</strong> This lasts for just a second before they begin sliding. If you want to trigger it even faster, rolling during a run will immediately transition to the slide animation.</p><p><strong>Certain weapon attacks can also combine with the sliding state, as long as they’re performed on a sloped surface.</strong> Ironically enough, no attacks that feature your hunter sliding on the ground during the animation will work. The following weapons can trigger a slide in <em>Monster Hunter Wilds</em>:</p><ul data-type="List" data-style="Bullet"><li><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/monster-hunter-wilds-best-weapon-the-charge-blade-guide-1851769340&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/monster-hunter-wilds-best-weapon-the-charge-blade-guide-1851769340">Charge Blade’s</a></span> Forward Slash</li><li>Dual Blades’ Demon Flurry Rush</li><li>Gunlance’s Lunging Upthrust</li><li>Hammer’s Charge</li><li>Lance’s Dash Attack</li><li>Sword &amp; Shield’s Advancing Slash</li></ul><p>If any of the above has sent you zooming down a hill, it might help to know that this maneuver does have a purpose. Every weapon has unique actions that can be performed while sliding. Some are simple aerial attacks that are best used for <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/monster-hunter-wilds-how-to-mount-master-mounter-1851775446&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/monster-hunter-wilds-how-to-mount-master-mounter-1851775446">mounting</a></span>, while others, like the Sword &amp; Shield, have multiple options and follow-ups. My personal favorite is getting crazy air with the Dual Blades and then spinning down a monster’s back to inflict some major damage. These are all pretty fun once you get the hang of them.</p><h2 id="h200645"><a id=""></a>How to master Sliding</h2><figure id="" data-id="5e9ff074ead72fab2610db85900f82a7" data-recommend-id="image://5e9ff074ead72fab2610db85900f82a7" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The Change Equipment screen, highlighting the Buttery Leathercraft Group Skill, Affinity Sliding." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="The Change Equipment screen, highlighting the Buttery Leathercraft Group Skill, Affinity Sliding." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Capcom / Samuel Moreno / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="5e9ff074ead72fab2610db85900f82a7" data-recommend-id="image://5e9ff074ead72fab2610db85900f82a7" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The Change Equipment screen, highlighting the Buttery Leathercraft Group Skill, Affinity Sliding." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>The most important tip I can give here is to be aware of what slopes might trigger a slide. The incline in the back of the Training Area is an excellent example. When you’re out gathering or hunting a monster, go ahead and experiment by rolling down some hills. This will be handy knowledge for future hunts so that you don’t slide when you don’t mean to. I know I wasn’t the only person to accidentally rush down the Windward Plains’ desert dunes while hunting <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/monster-hunter-wilds-mh-mon-hun-arch-tempered-rey-dau-1851782762&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/monster-hunter-wilds-mh-mon-hun-arch-tempered-rey-dau-1851782762">Arch-Tempered Rey Dau</a></span>.</p><p>Once you feel confident about using this technique when you intend to, it’s time to consider increasing its offensive power. Affinity Sliding is a skill that provides a boost to your <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/monster-hunter-wilds-affinity-meaning-negative-upgrade-1851775744&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/monster-hunter-wilds-affinity-meaning-negative-upgrade-1851775744">Affinity</a></span> when sliding on terrain. This is another case where the skill’s description fails to convey just how amazing a buff you receive. I’ve confirmed through testing that it provides a massive 30 percent Affinity boost that lasts for 30 seconds. No matter if your build is low on Affinity or already boasts a high percentage, this is an impressive upgrade.</p><p>The main drawback is that this is tied to the Buttery Leathercraft Group Skill, which is unfortunately attached to some weaker armors. If you’re going to hunt a monster in a hilly area and want high Affinity, including it in a build might be a good strategy. Just try not to activate this buff when you’re too close to a monster, since the skill won’t kick in until you’ve been sliding for about a second.</p><p>I can’t blame anyone who gets annoyed by this mechanic. Sliding past an enemy is a huge inconvenience, especially if you have to run back up a big hill to continue the fight. Understanding how to trigger it and the benefits of doing so will be a big help going forward.</p><p>.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://kotaku.com/monster-hunter-wilds-mhw-slide-hill-how-to-attack-1851785365]]></content:encoded>

The studio is “based in Tokyo,” implying Nintendo EPD Tokyo. But teams at Nintendo can be fluid, with veterans moving between projects and reshuffling groups of developers as things move through various points in production. </p><p>Who exactly is leading <em>Donkey Kong Bananza</em>? Like, what are their actual names? <em>Mario Odyssey</em> was produced by Koichi Hayashida, director on <em>Mario 3D Land </em>and <em>Mario Galaxy </em>2, and Yoshiaki Koizumi, whose Nintendo credits date back to the original<em> Super Smash Bros</em> (he also led <em>Donkey Kong Jungle Beat</em>), and it was the directorial debut of Kenta Motokura, who also came from<em> 3D Land</em> and <em>Galaxy 2</em>. Is the same squad leading on <em>Bananza</em>? <em>VGC</em> asked and Nintendo wouldn’t say. <br></p><p>There are two reasons why this caginess matters. The first is that games are made by people, not monolithic corporations, and it’s always worth reminding everyone of that whenever possible. Nintendo was content to lean into the star power of its homegrown talent for years, making it even odder now that it tries to keep those kinds details temporarily under wraps (they will eventually come out in the credits, after all).</p><p>The second is that if the <em>Mario Odyssey </em>team is making <em>Donkey Kong Bananza</em>, than who is making the next 3D <em>Mario</em>? There are three obvious possibilities here. The first is that Nintendo EPD Tokyo is somehow splitting its time and working on both. Another option is that a different internal team has taken the reigns of Mario for his 3D debut on Switch 2. The last and least appealing possibility is that we’re effectively getting a launch window 3D <em>Donkey Kong</em>  <em>instead</em> of a launch window<em> </em>3D<em> Mario </em>game, with the true successor to <em>Odyssey</em> <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SnlG8G3yAM&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SnlG8G3yAM" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">potentially many years off</a></span>. <br></p><p>For now at least, some initial evidence and rumors point to the first option. “<em>DK Bananza</em> is being developed by a new team that was spun off from the <em>Odyssey</em> team,” YouTuber and game dev interviewer KiwiTalkz <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://x.com/kiwitalkz/status/1935076156115747054&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://x.com/kiwitalkz/status/1935076156115747054" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">claimed last week</a></span>. “There are a lot of younger devs in the<em> Odyssey</em> team that grew up playing the <em>DKC</em> games and wanted to make one.” He added that to his knowledge, a new <em>3D Mario</em> is still “on the way.” </p><p>The younger spin-off team theory, reiterated by <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://x.com/Andy_VGC/status/1940034830663557249&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://x.com/Andy_VGC/status/1940034830663557249" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>VGC</em>’s Andy Robinson</a></span>, suggests the best of both worlds: a triumphant return for 3D Donkey Kong under growing talent and as others from <em>Mario Odyssey</em> continue working on the next <em>3D Mario</em>. But everything remains speculation until <em>Donkey Kong Bananza</em> is finally out, or Nintendo stops acting like game credits are state secrets. One of those is happening no matter what on July 17. </p><p>.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://kotaku.com/switch-2-3d-mario-odyssey-donkey-kong-bananza-director-1851785403]]></content:encoded>
