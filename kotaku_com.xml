              <p>Apple products have long carried a premium price tag that puts them out of reach for many shoppers, forcing budget-conscious buyers toward mid-range Windows laptops instead. The landscape shifts dramatically this Black Friday as Amazon drops<a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5068/"> the 2025 MacBook Air with M4 chip and 256GB SSD storage to $749, slashed from its regular $999 price</a>. This 25% discount is an <strong>all-time low that arrived on Friday</strong>, November 14th, and makes Apple’s latest-generation laptop accessible at the same price point as solid mid-range Windows alternatives. Apple famously avoids Black Friday sales in its own retail stores which means you need to check authorized retailers like Amazon to catch these deals when they surface.</p>

<h2>M4 Performance That Redefines Ultraportable Computing</h2>
<p>The M4 chip provides a significant performance jump over previous MacBook Airs due to the improved architecture of the CPU and GPU that handle demanding workloads with ease. The eight-core CPU splits into performance and efficiency cores, with the system apportioning intensive tasks to high-power cores and routing background processes to power-sipping efficient cores.</p>



<p>The 16GB of unified memory is a significant boost compared to the base configuration of 8GB that shipped with previous models, offering plenty of RAM overhead for professional applications and serious multitasking. Unified memory architecture means the CPU and GPU share one pool of memory, averting the data transfer bottlenecks inherent in systems where graphics processors must copy data from system RAM into dedicated video memory.</p>



<p>Storage comes by way of a 256GB SSD, providing ample room for the operating system, essential applications, and working files; however, heavy media creators or users with considerable local storage needs may want to look into external storage options. The SSD uses Apple’s custom controllers, which have a read speed of over 2,000MB/s, making the MacBook Air launch applications instantly and transfer large files in seconds.</p>
<p>The <strong>Liquid Retina display is 13.6 inches with a resolution of 2560×1664 and a support for one billion colors</strong> for excellent color accuracy and detail that is rivaled only by displays on much more expensive professional laptops. It will automatically adjust the white balance using True Tone technology if the ambient lighting changes. This reduces eye strain during marathon work sessions since color temperature is consistently maintained independent of your surroundings.</p>
<p><strong>Apple Intelligence integration brings AI-powered writing assistance</strong>, content generation and automation of tasks right into macOS through on-device processing that keeps your data private. This personal intelligence system helps in drafting emails, summarizing documents, generating images, and organizing information-all without sending your data to cloud servers.</p>



<p><strong>Battery life reaches up to 18 hours of mixed use</strong> which translates to full workdays without hunting for power outlets or carrying charging cables. This endurance comes from the efficiency of Apple Silicon combined with macOS optimization that manages background processes aggressively. The laptop delivers consistent performance whether plugged in or running on battery, unlike many Windows laptops, which throttle performance significantly when unplugged as a means of preserving battery life.</p>
<p>At $749, this MacBook Air is cheaper than many premium Windows ultrabooks.</p>

              <p>Power outages leave you sitting in the dark with dead phones and spoiling food in the fridge while camping trips often mean sacrificing modern conveniences or lugging noisy generators. Jackery’s Explorer 1000 portable power station solves both problems by <strong>delivering 1,500W of clean and quiet power</strong> that runs refrigerators, charges laptops and keeps essential devices operational wherever you need electricity. Amazon <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3722/">has slashed the price to $349 from the usual $699 for Black Friday, which marks an all-time low that undercuts even Prime Day pricing</a>. This 50% discount makes backup power accessible at a price point where you’d normally find much smaller capacity units with limited output capabilities.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3722/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Serious Power Output in a Portable Package</h2>
<p>The <strong>1,500W of continuous AC output</strong> tackles demanding appliances that smaller power stations can’t touch: air conditioners, full-size refrigerators, electric kettles, and power tools. The <strong>3,000W surge peak</strong> covers the inrush of power at startup for appliances with motors, which generally requires two to three times the running wattage for a brief moment. That surge capacity means you can cold-start a refrigerator or air conditioner without tripping the protection circuits on the power station-a problem that frequently occurs with underpowered portable generators.</p>
<p>The battery capacity, <strong>1,070Wh</strong>, translates to approximately 1.07 kilowatt-hours of stored energy-sufficient to keep an average refrigerator running for about 12 to 15 hours, charge a laptop eight to ten times, or run LED lights for days. This capacity sits in the sweet spot between smaller units that drain too quickly and larger systems that become impractical to move around. At <strong>just 23.8 pounds</strong> with a foldable handle, the power station remains genuinely portable rather than being a stationary unit that requires two people to relocate.</p>



<p>Jackery fitted this model with LiFePO4 battery chemistry instead of the more conventional lithium-ion, which grants it much better longevity and safety characteristics. The LiFePO4 cells retain more than 70% of their original capacity after 4,000 charge cycles, which equates to well over a decade of regular use before you’d notice significant capacity degradation.</p>



<p><strong>The capability for one-hour fast charging</strong> requires the emergency charging mode, which can be turned on via the Jackery app and will push this power station from empty to full in sixty minutes when you need a quick turnaround. The default for the system is a 1.7-hour charging mode that optimizes battery health by reducing stress on the cells during charging, adding to the long lifespan.</p>
<p>Port selection largely covers most device types: <strong>two USB-C ports providing 100W each, one USB-A port, one DC car port, and three pure sine wave AC outlets</strong>. The 100W USB-C ports can charge modern laptops at full speed with no need for bulky power adapters, while pure sine wave AC output safely powers sensitive electronics like medical devices or audio equipment that can be damaged by modified sine wave inverters found in cheaper units.</p>
<p>For sale at $349, this power station is half its regular price and brings with it capabilities that easily command between $600 to $800 in today’s market.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[This HP Laptop with Serious Specs (Ryzen 7, 1TB SSD, 32GB) Is Down $2,200, Now 73% Off on Amazon]]></title>
            <link>https://kotaku.com/this-hp-laptop-with-serious-specs-ryzen-7-1tb-ssd-32gb-is-2200-off-but-hp-is-keeping-it-quiet-on-amazon-2000644474</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/this-hp-laptop-with-serious-specs-ryzen-7-1tb-ssd-32gb-is-down-2-200-now-73-off-on-amazon.1354396/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Budget laptops usually force you to compromise on something important whether that’s skimping on RAM, settling for slow storage or accepting some dim screen that strains your eyes. <strong>HP’s 2025 laptop breaks that pattern by packing 32GB of RAM, a 1TB SSD, and an AMD Ryzen 7 7730U</strong> processor into a package that Amazon <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5596/">currently offers for $799, slashed from the typical $2,999 price</a>. This 73% discount is an all-time low and brings professional-grade specifications to a price point where you’d normally find an entry-level machine with half the memory and storage.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5596/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Professional Workloads</h2>
<p>The base frequency of the AMD Ryzen 7 7730U is 2 GHz with <strong>up to 4.5 GHz turbo, 8 cores, and 16 threads for powerful computing</strong> that will make short work of even the most demanding applications. This multi-core architecture is great for running parallel workloads such as video encoding, 3D rendering, or virtual machines. With 16 threads, the processor can support twice as many simultaneous operations as it has physical cores, meaning smoother multitasking when you’re working with dozens of open browser tabs along with office and productivity programs in addition to background applications.</p>



<p>The 32GB of high-speed RAM includes generous headroom for memory-intensive workflows that would choke on the 8GB or 16GB found in most budget laptops. Professional software like Adobe Creative Suite, statistical analysis tools, or development environments utilizing multiple running containers all benefit from this expanded memory capacity. You can keep numerous applications active simultaneously without experiencing the slowdowns that occur when systems run out of physical RAM and resort to slower disk-based virtual memory.</p>



<p>Storage comes via a 1TB PCIe SSD which affords rapid boot times and near-instant application launches compared to traditional hard drives or even older SATA SSDs. PCIe solid-state drives connect directly to the motherboard through high-speed lanes that enable transfer rates often exceeding 3,000MB/s, meaning large file operations complete quickly rather than devolve into progress bar watching sessions.</p>
<p>The <strong>display is a 15.6-inch FHD touchscreen that operates at 1920×1080 with IPS technology</strong> so colors are accurate and viewing angles are wide. The micro-edge design minimizes the bezels around the screen to create a more immersive viewing experience and makes it feel larger than its actual diagonal measurement. Touch functionality adds another input method that feels natural for certain tasks like scrolling through long documents, zooming into images, or interacting with the touch-optimized interface elements under Windows 11.</p>
<p>For $799, this laptop is priced lower than many mid-range options, yet has specs typical of laptops costing between $1,500 and $2,000. The 73% discount places it in the unusual position of actually getting you legitimately premium components at budget pricing, not the other way around, where you pay premium prices for budget hardware.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/destiny-2%E2%80%98s-roadmap-is-still-missing-as-it-tries-to-dig-out-from-under-its-worst-year-ever.1354348/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><em>The Edge of Fate</em> was supposed to be a bold new foundation for <a href="https://kotaku.com/playstation-bungie-marathon-destiny-2-acquisition-fiscal-2000642935"><em>Destiny 2</em>‘s future</a>. Instead, it was the beginning of the decade-old sci-fi shooter’s most disappointing stretch yet. Back in September, Bungie promised a roadmap laying out the vision for the live-service MMO in the year ahead. Two months later, the plans are still in flux. Bungie now says it won’t be ready to reveal what <em>Destiny 2</em> looks like moving forward until early 2026. In the meantime, it’s scrambling to engineer a 180 with its upcoming <em>Star Wars </em>expansion.</p> <p>“As we continue to act on your feedback, we’re taking additional time to craft our long-term strategy for the future of <em>Destiny</em> before we share a full State of the Game and multi-year roadmap next year,” the studio revealed this week. It treated fans to what it’s called a new “Content Calendar” instead. No big ideas. No major overhauls. But it did preview everything fans can expect from the <a href="https://kotaku.com/destiny-2-star-wars-renegades-lightsaber-x-wing-ash-iron-2000624489">December 2 <em>Renegades</em> expansion</a> and its first significant update.</p>

 <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">Destiny 2: Renegades Content Calendar has been published.</p> <p>We need more time for the roadmap, plain and simple. Expect a true Roadmap, and State of the Game, next year.</p> <p>Again, many apologies. <a href="https://t.co/fw9R49MriX">https://t.co/fw9R49MriX</a> <a href="https://t.co/eKkSURkpjE">pic.twitter.com/eKkSURkpjE</a></p> <p>— dmg04 (@A_dmg04) <a href="https://twitter.com/A_dmg04/status/1989091556884889623?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 13, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <p>The big takeaways? All players will be able to hit the new Power cap just by playing <em>Renegades</em> activities, vault capacity will go up to 1,000 slots to accommodate all the new loot, and all Exotic Armor ornaments can now be swapped between gear of the same class and slot, giving a big boost to <em>Destiny 2</em>‘s fashion meta. The seasonal Dawning, Iron Banner, and Call to Arms events will also be returning. Any lapsed players probably have no idea what to make of Bungie saying stuff like “Vanguard Alerts will bring back some Nightfall vibes,” but long story short: <em>Renegades</em> should hopefully cut a lot of the grindy bullshit <a href="https://kotaku.com/destiny-2-edge-fate-matterspark-kelper-metroid-ball-1851786415">fans faced in <em>Edge of Fate</em> back in July</a>.</p>

 <p>Here’s Bungie’s brief postmortem on what feels like <em>Destiny 2</em>‘s least played, most panned expansion since launch:</p> <blockquote><p>With <em>Edge of Fate,</em> we presented a different vision for the future of <em>Destiny 2</em>’s core game. One intended to refocus our releases and player call-to-action on a familiar but deeper pursuit of Power and ascending to higher Tiers of gear across a wider range of activities supporting customizable challenge and commensurate rewards.</p> <p>Very quickly, the feedback made it clear that this was the wrong path for <em>Destiny</em>.</p> <p>Even if our execution had been perfect, and we see plainly that it was not, it is clear that grinding Power will never be a substitute for earning a trophy. Climbing though throwaway tiers en-route to the gear you want to build around isn’t aspirational. And the Portal itself surrenders too much of <em>Destiny</em>’s feeling of place and exploration. These lessons, and many others besides them, have been taken to heart by our team over the last three months.</p></blockquote> <p>I have no doubt that <a href="https://kotaku.com/bungie-destiny-2-sony-final-shape-playstation-1851077097">Bungie has taken</a> all of the negative feedback to heart. I imagine this has probably been one of the toughest stretches, purely in terms of morale, in the game’s post-launch life. But it remains to be seen if the studio can still engineer a way out of <em>Destiny 2</em>‘s 2025 nosedive. The challenge, as ever, is in how you make doing the same stuff over and over again still feel fresh more than a decade later. Maybe you can’t. Or maybe<em> Destiny 2</em> just needs a humble back-to-basics reboot, at least for its progression and weekly grind. I’m still rooting for it.</p>
