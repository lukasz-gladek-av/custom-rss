              <p><em>Supergirl</em> is out next summer and we finally have our first official trailer. It’s still just a “teaser,” so lots about the upcoming DC movie is still unknown, but it nevertheless sets the stage for what to expect from the next chapter in <a href="https://kotaku.com/superman-post-credits-james-gunn-dcu-marvel-supergirl-1851786204">James Gunn’s new comic book universe</a>. It also includes a great quote that deftly sums up the difference between Kara and Clark.</p> <p>“He sees the goodness in everyone, I see the truth,” Supergirl says when asked what distinguishes her <a href="https://kotaku.com/superman-israel-palestine-woke-clark-kent-punk-rock-1851786212">from the Man of Steel</a>. It puts the perfect period on a teaser for what feels, on the surface, like DC’s take on <em>Guardians of the Galaxy</em> but is actually playing with some very different ideas. Out in theaters on June 26, 2026, the movie will start with Supergirl off-planet celebrating her 23rd birthday with Krypto. But she eventually takes a break from drinking her trauma away to help a mysterious woman named Ruthye Marye Knoll on her quest for revenge.</p>

  <p>The events of the movie are based on the limited series <i>Supergirl: Woman of Tomorrow</i> from a few years back by writer Tom King and artist Bilquis Evely. Largely praised at the time, it dives into Supergirl’s past and details an origin story in which Kara and her family initially survive Krypton’s destruction in Argo City thanks to a special shield, only for remnants of the planetary collapse to eventually lead to the slow death of the remaining inhabitants due to radiation poisoning.</p>

 <p>It contrasts with the backstory of Superman, who lost his original family but never directly experienced the cataclysmic event that took them. It was a single event rather than a slow death. Whatever the precise version of events for Supergirl in the film, the trailer is clearly setting up the reasons why Kara’s a nihilistic drunk unlike her endlessly hopeful and idealistic cousin.</p>

 <h2>Yes that’s a split-second look at Jason Momoa as Lobo</h2> <p>We don’t get much else in the initial teaser, though we do catch a glimpse of Krem of the Yellow Hills, the person Ruthye Marye Knoll is hunting for revenge, and Lobo, though the latter’s face is only visible for a few frames. Jason Momoa certainly looks the part but we’ll see if he can play DC’s chaotic alien biker bad boy with the right balance of loud machismo and unhinged charisma or if he’ll just be Aquaman again.</p> <p>Visually, the movie looks kind of bland. Look, the trailer is only two minutes, but there’s a lot of vaguely sci-fi junkyard ruins and grey-brown space rocks here. The kinds of motifs that helped give <em>Guardians of the Galaxy</em> a sense of clear identity don’t seem to be here, at least not at first glance. We’ll see if that identity comes through more in future trailers. Hopefully, the story that director Craig Gillespie and script writer Ana Nogueira are telling here can deliver something that feels fresh and compelling either way.</p>

              <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/fallout-season-2-teaser-images-new-vegas-lucky-38-mr-house-lucy-2000618233"><em>Fallout</em> season two on Amazon Prime</a> is nearly here, so it’s time to get ready. And what better way to get caught up on what happened in the popular adaptation of Bethesda’s RPG franchise than by watching Amazon’s official season one recap? I mean, it’s not like they would use AI tools to create it and fill it with inaccurate information. Right?</p> <p>Wrong. That’s exactly what Amazon did. <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/entertainment/sci-fi-movies/the-official-fallout-season-1-recap-is-filled-with-ai-and-thinks-the-show-is-set-in-the-1950s/">As spotted by <em>Gamesradar</em></a>, a newly uploaded <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Fallout-Season-2/dp/B0FLSZBRZJ?tag=kotaku01-20" rel="false"><em>Fallout</em> recap on the show’s official Amazon Prime page</a> appears to use a monotone AI-generated voice to narrate over clips from the show’s inaugural season. It sounds horrible and makes it hard to actually consume the information being delivered. But that might be a good thing because some of what the robot voice spits out is completely bullshit. Just straight up inaccurate.</p>

 <figure id="attachment_2000652683" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000652683"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000652683">©Amazon / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p>For example, at multiple points in the short recap, the AI-generated voice claims that the flashbacks seen in the show take place in the 1950s. That’s wrong. Those flashbacks featuring pre-ghoulified Cooper Howard take place around 2077. Specifically, the flashback showing the <a href="https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Great_War">nukes falling on America takes place on October 23, 2077</a>.</p>

 <p>The recap also claims that Lucy goes with the Ghoul at the end of the <em>Fallout</em> season finale because she has to choose between life and death. Wrong again, you dumb robot. She actually goes because she wants to track down her father and learn the truth. Something the Ghoul is interested in, too.</p> <p>There are probably other inaccuracies in this horrible, shitty recap, but whatever, I’m going to waste as little time on this as possible, as it seems Amazon doesn’t care enough about one of its biggest TV shows to simply put out an accurate, human-created two-minute recap. <a href="https://kotaku.com/amazon-ai-generated-english-dub-banana-fish-reaction-2000649707">This isn’t the first time Amazon Prime has upset people by using generative AI</a> to produce worthless slop, and I doubt it will be the last, as every big tech company invests more and more into something very few people seem to want or like.</p> <p>Anyway,<em> Fallout</em> season two arrives exclusively on Amazon Prime on December 17.</p>
