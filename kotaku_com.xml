            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Shopping for a gaming laptop means balancing several critical factors: <strong>you need a powerful GPU</strong> that can handle modern games at high settings, <strong>a fast processor</strong> that won’t bottleneck performance, <strong>enough RAM</strong> for smooth multitasking, and a <strong>display with a high refresh rate</strong> that keeps up with fast-paced action. The ASUS ROG Strix G16 checks every box with its Nvidia GeForce RTX 5060 GPU powered by the new Blackwell architecture, Intel Core i7-14650HX processor, 16GB of DDR5 RAM, and a 165Hz display. This 2025 model has already seen a price drop recently, but <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4592/">Amazon just pushed it to a new all-time low of $1,199, down from $1,499</a>. That’s also $300 off and cheaper than the 2024 model currently sells for.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4592/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<p>The RTX 5060 GPU is a major step ahead due to <strong>the Nvidia Blackwell architecture</strong>: It introduces DLSS 4 technology, which employs AI to create additional frames and accelerate performance without compromise to visual fidelity. Practically, you are free to play demanding games such as Cyberpunk 2077 or Alan Wake 2 at increased settings with smooth frame rates. The technologies for Max-Q aim for optimal power efficiency so the laptop produces muscular performance without overwhelming heat and fan noise. Ray tracing creates incredibly realistic lighting, reflections and shadows, and it enhances the visual experience for games supporting it.</p>
<h2>Processing Power and Memory Designed for Gaming</h2>
<p>The Intel Core i7-14650HX is a hybrid processor featuring 16 cores: <strong>8 performance cores for demanding tasks and 8 efficiency cores for background processes</strong>. This architecture means the laptop can handle gaming while simultaneously running Discord, streaming software, or browser tabs without stuttering. The base clock speeds reach up to 2.2 GHz, with <strong>boost frequencies climbing to 5.2 GHz</strong> when you need maximum power for intense gaming sessions or content creation work like video editing.</p>



<p>The <strong>16GB of DDR5-5.6GHz memory provides fast memory access</strong> to maintain smooth operation of everything. DDR5 is significantly faster than DDR4, reducing load times and delivering increased frame stability for memory-intensive games. The<strong> 1TB PCIe Gen 4 SSD provides ample storage</strong> for your game collection and serves up read speeds of up to 7,000 MB/s.</p>



<p>It uses a 16:10 aspect ratio instead of a typical 16:9, and gives it extra vertical screen estate useful for gaming and productivity work. The FHD+ resolution of 1920 x 1200 pixels is a sensible compromise between image sharpness and performance, as more demanding resolutions would involve extra stress on the GPU. Smooth motion during a bullet blaster or a racing game is <strong>provided by a refresh rate of 165Hz</strong> and motion blur and ghosting are eliminated by a 3ms response time.</p>
<p>The ROG <em>Intelligent Cooling</em> is where ASUS shows off its engineering expertise: <strong>End-to-end vapor chamber spreads heat across a larger surface</strong>&nbsp;and tri-fan technology exhausts more air through the case. Employing Conductonaut Extreme liquid metal on the chipset, rather than typical thermal paste, transfers heat more efficiently, retaining lower temperatures even during longer gaming sessions. Advanced cooling equates to a laptop operating at its highest potential, rather than thermal throttling.</p>
<p>At $1,199 for Prime members during its current Prime Big Deal Day sale, you are getting 2025’s current gaming technology at a sub-last-year’s-model cost.</p>

              <p>Tell me if this has ever happened to you. You and you’re friends are out having fun and you want to snap a quick group photo, or maybe something crazy is happening in front of you and you feel the need to record it. You pull out your phone, open the camera app, and then a little pop-up says your storage is full and that it can’t take any new photos. Then you frantically scrub through your camera roll looking for things okay to delete only for them to still not be enough somehow, and then the moment has passed.</p>
<p>Managing phone storage can be a nightmare, especially for those of us still carrying pics from over 10 years ago. There is a solution that is not upgrading to a larger capacity phone or paying a huge monthly fee for cloud storage. SanDisk has an SSD designed for use with phones which happens to be on sale for Amazon’s Prime Big Deals Day. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4590/">On October 7 and October 8, you can save $25 on the 1TB SSD (comes to $110) or $37 on the 2TB SSD (comes to $170).</a></p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4590/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Record on Your Phone to the Drive</h2>
<p>This SanDisk external SSD has been made specifically for use with your phone. It connects over USB-C meaning its compatible on any iPhone 15 and up and can then record photos and videos directly to the drive. The drive uses exFAT formatting which means it’s compatible with Windows, Android, and macOS devices right out of the box.</p>
<p>The Creator Phone SSD is even shaped to fit snuggly on the back of your Phone without being visible from the front. It uses MagSafe so it actually magnetically connects to the back of your phone, staying firmly in place while in use.</p>



<p>Along with recording new footage or photography onto the drive, you can also transfer stuff already on your camera roll to the drive or vice versa. Great for if you want spend an afternoon clearing out some of your old photos without getting rid of them to just make room new ones.</p>
<p>The drive really shines for for creators who frequently record video using their phone be it for work or otherwise. You can shoot in Apple ProRes 4K at 60 fps when paired with an iPhone 15 Pro/Pro Max or iPhone 16 Pro/Pro Max. Great for long shoots and then you already have the video files on a drive that can easily be transferred to your PC or Mac.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Bose Is Clearing Out Its TV Soundbar, Now Selling for 4x Cheaper Than Any Direct Competitor]]></title>
            <link>https://kotaku.com/bose-is-clearing-out-its-tv-soundbar-now-selling-for-4x-cheaper-than-any-direct-competitor-2000632587</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/bose-is-clearing-out-its-tv-soundbar-now-selling-for-4x-cheaper-than-any-direct-competitor.1318819/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Quality soundbars for your TV can easily run $1,000 or more, which makes better audio feel like a luxury purchase. The Bose TV speaker breaks that pattern by delivering clear and improved sound at a fraction of that cost. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3727/">Normally priced at $279, this soundbar is now down to $199 for Prime Big Deal Day</a>, which marks an all-time low and only the second discount this year. Beyond improving your TV audio, <strong>it doubles as a Bluetooth speaker for your living room</strong> that you can control from your smartphone.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3727/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<p>The underlying issue it addresses is easy: built-in TV speakers sound thin and muddy which causes dialogue to be difficult to follow and diminishes your enjoyment of shows and films. The Bose TV Speaker fixes it by <strong>employing two angled full-range drivers that produce a broader and more natural soundstage</strong>. Rather than having sound directly emanate at your face from one point, angled drivers reflect sound off your walls and bring it to life and opening it up, as it were.</p>
<h2>Dialogue Mode Makes Every Word Crystal Clear</h2>
<p>The dedicated dialogue enhancement feature is where we really see this soundbar excel for everyday listening. Bose designed the speaker to expressly zero in on vocal and pronunciation, and lifts dialogue out of the mix so that you can clearly hear each word without having to turn it up too high. There’s a remote included that has a button for a dialogue mode, which amplifies speech even more when desired. There’s also a bass boost mode for times when you want a deeper sound during music scenes or action scenes.</p>



<p>Setup only takes minutes due to a single-cable connection: <strong>Use your optical audio cable included, or connect via HDMI ARC if your TV is capable</strong> (HDMI cable not included). HDMI ARC provides a benefit of controlling soundbar volume by your TV’s remote for a seamless experience. Ultra-slim at just 2.21 inches high, 23.38 inches wide, and 4.02 inches deep, <strong>it fits seamlessly in front of nearly all TVs</strong>, neither covering nor obstructing IR sensor nor your view of the picture. It’s <strong>also wall mountable</strong> if a cleaner aesthetic is your preference, though brackets are separately available.</p>
<p>The Bluetooth connectivity offers convenience apart from TV sound: You <strong>are allowed to connect your smartphone, tablet, or laptop to stream music</strong>&nbsp;or even audiobooks directly through the soundbar’s sound output. The <strong>speaker stores a total of three devices</strong> via its multiple inputs: HDMI, optical and auxiliary. Whichever device is turned on first actually connects to it automatically, thereby never having to switch inputs manually each time.</p>
<p>At $199 for this Prime Big Deal Day sale, you’re getting sound engineering and construction of Bose for fewer dollars than are many budget soundbars which aren’t even CLOSE to providing clear and stereophonic sound like this one does.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Whether Samsung Likes It or Not, Amazon Just Slashed the 49″ Odyssey OLED Gaming Monitor by Almost 50% for Prime Day]]></title>
            <link>https://kotaku.com/samsungs-wildest-49-inch-odyssey-oled-curved-gaming-monitor-is-going-for-45-less-with-this-deal-2000631874</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/whether-samsung-likes-it-or-not-amazon-just-slashed-the-49%E2%80%B3-odyssey-oled-gaming-monitor-by-almost-50-for-prime-day.1318777/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Is there anything better than getting fully immersed in your favorite titles, feeling like you’re part of the game? A standard 16:9 screen is sadly not made for that, and if you don’t want to get pulled out right when things get good, going ultrawide is the solution.</p>
<p>We know upgrades like this can feel overwhelming, since a good-sized ultrawide screen from a known brand can easily run you over $1,600, <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4584/">but that changes today. Thanks to Prime Day, the Samsung 49-inch Odyssey OLED G93SC curved gaming monitor is 44% off on Amazon, dropping the price to $900.</a> That’s one of the lowest prices we’ve ever seen on this wild screen, and with a $700 discount, it’s not a deal that’s likely to last long.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4584/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Massive Screen With Lifelike Visuals</h2>
<p>It’s a beast at 49 inches, offering brilliant colors, deeper contrast, and richer tones for lifelike visuals. More pixels per inch give you better detail, so you’re not sacrificing sharpness for size. The screen is as wide as two QHD monitors side by side, minus the dual setup fuss, with the 1800R curve wrapping around your field of vision for a distraction-free gaming or streaming experience. Dark colors come through clearly as well, thanks to QD-OLED technology and DisplayHDR True Black 400 support. Translation: better visibility even in low-light scenes; perfect for spotting the bad guys hiding in the dark and keeping an eye on shadows.</p>
<p>You’re also getting a 240Hz refresh rate and a 0.03ms response time to keep things smooth. Plus, with both NVIDIA G-Sync compatibility and AMD FreeSync Premium Pro, screen tearing and input lag won’t be an issue either. Connectivity-wise, you’re covered with HDMI 2.1, DisplayPort, and a built-in USB hub. There’s also an Auto Source Switch+ that can detect when the connected devices are turned on and switch over automatically.</p>



<p>For when you’re in the mood for some multitasking, the Picture-by-Picture mode splits the screen in half. Maybe use one for video calls, while having work documents and the browser open on the second. Or maybe stream your favorite content on one side while editing on the other? The possibilities are endless.</p>
<p>Even with all this, the overall design stays minimal. It’s just 4.5mm thick at its thinnest point, which makes it one of the slimmest OLED panels in this range.<a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4584/"> It’s still a bit of an investment at $900, but this deal brings it into a much more approachable range than we usually see.</a></p>

            <title><![CDATA[If You Have an iPhone, You Can Get Two Free AirTags on Amazon]]></title>
            <link>https://kotaku.com/if-you-have-an-iphone-you-can-get-two-free-airtags-on-amazon-2000632567</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/if-you-have-an-iphone-you-can-get-two-free-airtags-on-amazon.1318771/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Losing your keys, wallet or luggage ranks among the most frustrating daily experiences. Apple’s AirTag solves this problem in a way no competitor can match, thanks to the <em>Find My</em> network powered by hundreds of millions of Apple devices worldwide. This massive network means your lost item can be located almost anywhere, even if it’s miles away from your own iPhone.</p>
<p>For Prime Big Deal Day, Amazon has dropped AirTag prices to record lows. The <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3844/">4-pack now costs just $64, down from $99</a>: Since a single AirTag normally sells for $29, <strong>this deal essentially gives you almost two free AirTags</strong>. If you only need one, the single AirTag is <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4215/">also at an all-time low of $19, down from $29</a>.</p>

<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4215/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See Single AirTag at Amazon</a></p>

<p>AirTags function by using Apple’s Find My network, <strong>a group of all iPhones, iPads, and Macs with their location services running</strong>. When you flag an AirTag lost, other <strong>Apple devices running Bluetooth proximity</strong> to it can pick up its Bluetooth signal and report its location anonymously back to yours. It all occurs entirely behind the scenes without notification of the other device’s owner, and all of your location information stays encrypted and private. By virtue of its massive scale, your AirTag becomes locatable even in isolated regions, if someone running an Apple device wanders by.</p>
<h2>Precision Location Detection and Privacy-Aware Design</h2>
<p>Installing an AirTag is a matter of seconds. You just point it near your iPhone or iPad, tap to pair and tag it to an item like your keys or backpack. The U1 chip in newer iPhones powers Precision Finding employs ultra-wideband technology and walks you straight to your AirTag with onscreen arrows and haptic indicators. As you approach, your iPhone displays the exact distance and direction and turns a potentially frantic search into a mere follow-the-arrows endeavor.</p>



<p>Each AirTag uses a <strong>typical CR2032 replaceable battery</strong>, which runs for approximately a year with average use. You’ll receive a notification when it’s running low, and it’s a breeze to replace it by pressing down and twisting off the stainless steel back case. The <strong>AirTag is water- and dust-resistant IP67</strong> so it’s fine being submerged for 30 minutes for a distance of a meter of water.</p>
<p>Privacy features are built into the core design: If an unknown AirTag is traveling with you, your iPhone alerts you automatically. Android users can also detect nearby AirTags using Apple’s Tracker Detect app. The AirTag will also play a sound if it’s been separated from its owner for an extended period, preventing unwanted tracking. These safeguards address privacy concerns while maintaining the device’s usefulness for legitimate tracking.</p>



<p>The thin, lightweight design is just 1.26 inches across and 0.31 inches deep, tiny enough to slip into a wallet’s card slot or affix to a keychain. The shiny stainless steel face is customizable with free engraving if you order directly from Apple, but Amazon’s sale does not include it.</p>
<p>The 4-pack is nicely priced for families, couples, or individuals having several things they’d like to monitor. Put one on your keys, a second on your wallet, a third on your backpack, and maintain a fourth as a spare for your suitcase when traveling. For $64 for four during your Prime Big Deal Day sale, you’re really spending less money per AirTag than ever before.</p>
