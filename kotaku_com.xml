A certificate of Authenticity signed by GameStop CEO Ryan Cohen is also included.</p><p>  “The items are being auctioned as a set to raise funds for Children’s Miracle Network Hospitals,” said GameStop. “While the incident itself was unfortunate, we hope its legacy serves a greater purpose.” <br></p><p>Here’s how GameStop describes the stapler that did the damage: </p><blockquote data-type="BlockQuote"><p>The black stapler used by a GameStop associate who, in a moment of launch night excitement and misjudged enthusiasm, stapled a receipt directly to a customer’s new Nintendo Switch 2 box—puncturing both cardboard and screen in one swift motion.

Its only redeeming quality is in its spice, but that’s secondary to your need to survive. You require water. Without a constant supply of hydration, the massive sandworms roaming the dunes will be the least of your worries.

These flowers, a pinkish-red in hue, are known as Dew Fields. Their sole purpose is to provide sustenance to survivors like you. You can’t harvest them otherwise.</p><p>The downside, however, is that Dew Fields only provide enough water to fill your thirst meter to the first gauge.

You won’t encounter bandit camps too frequently, but they’re common enough that you should have a steady supply. Venture out of your base long enough to cut down two or three bandits, or even a player or two if you’re feeling confident, and then harvest their blood using a Blood Extractor and Blood Sack.</p><p>With your sustenance in hand, return to your base—ideally one with power, as you’ll need it for the workbench—and dump the blood into a Blood Purifier. It will take some time for the machine to work its magic, drawing out life-saving water from your enemy’s blood.
