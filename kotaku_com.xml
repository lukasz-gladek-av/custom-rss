              <p>For years, PlayStation fans have begged for a remake of<em> Bloodborne</em>. <a href="https://kotaku.com/bluepoint-sony-playstation-ps5-god-war-2000671390">Bluepoint Games</a>, the PlayStation studio behind the excellently received <em>Demon’s Souls</em> remake, seemed like the obvious candidate. <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2026-02-27/sony-s-bluepoint-pitched-bloodborne-remake-before-closure?accessToken=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJzb3VyY2UiOiJTdWJzY3JpYmVyR2lmdGVkQXJ0aWNsZSIsImlhdCI6MTc3MjIyMjY3OSwiZXhwIjoxNzcyODI3NDc5LCJhcnRpY2xlSWQiOiJUQjRWUTJLR0NURlowMCIsImJjb25uZWN0SWQiOiJCMUVBQkI5NjQ2QUM0REZFQTJBRkI4MjI1MzgyQTJFQSJ9.s6maZIveh-F152mZBWUNjPFeE0Lm7AFRegwaizQvVlA">According to <em>Bloomberg</em></a>, the first-party team actually did pitch a <em>Bloodborne</em> remake not too long ago, but FromSoftware rejected the idea.</p> <p>In fact, many at Bluepoint had assumed for a long time <a href="https://kotaku.com/bloodborne-remake-bluepoint-demons-souls-ps5-sony-playstation-2000671988">that a <em>Bloodborne</em> remake was inevitable</a>. Then in 2025, after its <em>God of War</em> multiplayer project was cancelled, Bloomberg reports that the idea of the studio fielding such a remake was formally pitched within Sony. Unfortunately, FromSoftware wasn’t onboard. While Bluepoint scrambled to come up with other ideas, including a potential <em>Ghost of Tsushima</em> spin-off, Sony never greenlit any of the other pitches.</p>

 <p><em>Bloomberg</em> doesn’t report exactly why FromSoftware rejected the pitch. The only real theory for why is one offered by former PlayStation Worldwide Studios executive Shuhei Yoshida <a href="https://kotaku.com/bloodborne-2-remake-remaster-miyazaki-sequel-1851741356">in an interview last year</a>. “I have only my personal theory to that situation,” he said in 2025. “I left first-party Sony so I don’t know what’s going on, but my theory is— because I remember Miyazaki really, really loved<em>&nbsp;Bloodborne</em>, what he created—and so I think he is interested, but he’s so successful and he’s so busy so he cannot do it himself, but he doesn’t want anyone else to touch it. So that’s my theory, and the PlayStation team respects his wish.”</p> <p>All of this suggests that a <em>Bloodborne</em> remake by FromSoftware itself could still happen at some point in the future, but that possibility is little consolation for fans who don’t want to see one of the last console generation’s best games locked away exclusively on PS4. It’s also of no use to the folks at Bluepoint who might have had their studio saved if their remake pitch had actually come together.</p>

 <p>According to <em>Bloomberg</em>, the ultimate reason for the studio’s closure was a loss of faith among the higher-ups at Sony that Bluepoint could still deliver a high-quality original game as it has once been tasked with. <a href="https://kotaku.com/god-of-war-multiplayer-bluepoint-days-gone-2-concord-1851742012">The <em>God of War</em> live-service project</a> it had previously been working on would have reportedly featured Atreus navigating the underworld, but shift to co-op gameplay that never came together. Sony has moved forward with a remake of the original single-player trilogy, just without its best remake studio at the helm.</p>

              <p><span>Well, folks, it looks like </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-presents-winds-waves-pikachu-underwater-2000674398"><i><span>Pokémon Winds </span></i><span>and </span><i><span>Waves</span></i></a> <span>may have finally broken the series’ bad graphics curse. At least, that’s what it looks like based on </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-winds-waves-trailer-breakdown-presents-pikachu-2000674465"><span>the first trailer</span></a><span>, which appears to be a marked visual improvement over </span><i><span>Scarlet </span></i><span>and </span><i><span>Violet</span></i><span>, which have become </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-scarlet-violet-dlc-teal-mask-indigo-disk-gen-9-1851109325"><span>a poster child for the series’ poor technical performance</span></a><span>.</span></p> <p><i><span>Scarlet </span></i><span>and </span><i><span>Violet</span></i><span>, released in 2022,</span> <span>were the last Switch-exclusive </span><i><span>Pokémon </span></i><span>games, and were heavily derided for not only being a buggy mess, but for looking like a GameCube tech demo. They had a big map that had no real texture or life to it. When they got a Switch 2 update, they ran at a buttery smooth 60 frames-per-second, but they still looked really rough and old. </span><i><span>Winds </span></i><span>and </span><i><span>Waves</span></i><span>, meanwhile, have a notable technical and graphical leap, with much more dynamic lighting, shading, and water physics. The Pokémon themselves have a bit of texture to them similar to </span><i><span>Scarlet </span></i><span>and </span><i><span>Violet</span></i><span>’s models, but beyond that, any direct comparisons we might make work in </span><i><span>Winds </span></i><span>and </span><i><span>Waves</span></i><span>’</span> <span>favor. I’d still argue that it doesn’t look incredible by any stretch, but it definitely is the most dynamic-looking </span><i><span>Pokémon </span></i><span>game we’ve had in a while.</span></p>

            <title><![CDATA[This Video Of The McDonald’s CEO Struggling To Eat The New Big Arch Burger Is Cracking People Up]]></title>
            <link>https://kotaku.com/mcdonalds-ceo-big-arch-burger-instagram-2000674500</link>
            <guid>1448980</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>McDonald’s CEO and chairman Chris Kempczinski recently had to do the one part of the job I assume he dreads the most: Eat the food produced by his popular fast food chain. And it went about as well as you’d expect.</p> <p>I<a href="https://www.instagram.com/reel/DUTZ_ilDl41/">n a video originally posted on February 3 on Instagram</a>, Kempczinski recorded himself eating the new Big Arch Burger for lunch in his office. The video didn’t go super viral until people started sharing it on TikTok. And after watching it, I can see why so many people are fascinated by this short clip of a rich man eating a burger. But first the clip. Take it away, Chris K!</p>   <p>Where to start? First off, just a note from a human being who eats food, but perhaps you shouldn’t refer to your new hamburger as a “product.” It feels like a lawyer told him off-camera that, legally, it can’t be called food, so he should just call it a product. Once he’s done hyping it up, content creator Chris K opens it up and exclaims, “Holy cow.” Then, after looking over the burger, he looks at the camera with a flash of regret and says, “There’s so much going on with this.” You sound thrilled to eat it, buddy.</p> <figure id="attachment_2000674521" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000674521"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000674521">©McDonalds / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p>The CEO of McDonald’s then takes what I can only describe as the smallest bite of a burger I’ve ever seen. It looks like a kid having to try some vegetable he doesn’t want to eat, but is forced by his mom to eat just a tiny bit. In the moment after eating it, you can tell he’s not happy about it, but he bravely soldiers on. He’ll ask for a bigger bonus during the next round of negotiations and will point to this video as a reason why. He claims this is his lunch. Readers, I’m doubtful that the burger got finished.</p>

 <p>And look, I love me some McDonald’s. I don’t care much for the chain’s burgers, but the rest of the menu is fine in a pinch. So don’t take this blog as me saying McDonald’s is awful. But it is funny to watch a very rich man forced to eat food that he’d never consume otherwise and then smile about it afterwards. Funny stuff. Thanks for the Friday giggles, Chris K!</p>
