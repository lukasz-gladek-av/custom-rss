              <p>Some <em>Final Fantasy XIV</em> players like to say that the MMORPG has a “don’t ask, don’t tell” policy toward mods. While technically verboten under the strict terms of the game’s user agreement, Square Enix has mostly been content to look the other way as long as the mods aren’t interfering with the overall health and integrity of the game. <a href="https://kotaku.com/one-of-ffxivs-most-important-mods-is-shutting-down-and-people-are-losing-it-2000619228">But last week</a>, a plugin for <em>Final Fantasy XIV</em> called Mare Synchronos was taken down by its creator after receiving a letter from Square Enix’s lawyers. The crackdown came as a surprise to some, while others felt like players had left Square Enix with no choice but to take action. And reading between the lines of a new blog post from <em>Final Fantasy XIV</em> director Naoki “Yoshi-P” Yoshida, that’s essentially what happened.</p>

The two fighting-type Pokémon meet in a ring alongside their trainers, and Hawlucha plays to the crowd like a real luchador. Then in comes Machamp, who has a dramatic wrestler entrance of its own. The two clash, and it becomes clear that Hawlucha plays up the showmanship to the detriment of its performance in the battle. After Machamp teaches it a lesson in humility, Hawlucha thinks about all the training it took to get to this match and finds the strength to get back up, apologize to its trainer, and mega evolve. Mega Hawlucha gets a new mask and cape, its feathers forming a belt around its waist. It definitely heightens the luchador theme, but it feels a bit more grounded than the mega designs of Dragonite and Victreebel, which lean more fully into a kind of goofy, exaggerated charm. Machamp is no match for Hawlucha after it mega evolves, and the match is over pretty quick. Check out the full animated short below:</span></p> <p><iframe loading="lazy" title="FULL MATCH: Hawlucha vs. Machamp! | Pokémon Legends: Z-A" width="500" height="281" src="about:blank" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen="" data-rocket-lazyload="fitvidscompatible" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/RYCOc3SiU7A?feature=oembed"></iframe></p> <p><span>Like Draqonite and Victreebel, Hawluche was on the list of leaked Mega Evolutions from </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-legends-z-a-mega-evolutions-new-leak-starters-1851772521"><span>back in March</span></a><span>, so that list keeps looking more and more credible as time goes on. </span><i><span>Pokémon Legends: Z-A </span></i><span>is coming to Switch and Switch 2 on October 16.</span></p>

              <p>It doesn’t often happen that Amazon’s best-sellers list puts a budget Windows laptop next to high-end MacBook Airs, but that’s what’s happening right now. There’s an HP 14-inch model (Intel Celeron N4020, 4 GB RAM, 64 GB Storage) that has quietly become a serious player on the platform as one of the best-selling laptops on the site, and the reason why is simple: it’s awfully cheap.</p>
<p>With the ongoing Labor Day sale, <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3762/">you can get it for $172 down from its usual $230</a>. At that price, it’s one of the cheapest brand-new laptops you’ll find anywhere, and it’s less than some headphones or tablets.&nbsp;The deal becomes even harder to pass up when you factor in it also <strong>includes a one-year subscription to Microsoft 365</strong> which alone usually costs $129 (per year). And since that comes bundled for free, you’re essentially paying close to the value of the software and getting a full-sized laptop in exchange.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3762/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Why You Should Buy It</h2>
<p>The screen itself is a 14-inch HD micro-edge bezel panel that boasts a slim design that doesn’t scream “budget.” It’s not too small for Netflix sessions or working on documents, and its size sits comfortably in the sweet spot between being travel-friendly and being productive. The laptop is also easy to carry around thanks to a thin build and light weight which is convenient if you’re going to class or a local coffee shop.</p>
<p>The machine runs on <strong>Intel’s Celeron N4020 processor with 4GB of RAM and 64GB of storage</strong>. It’s not built for heavy creative projects or gaming, but that isn’t what this computer is meant for. Instead, it’s built to give you coverage for normal things such as Word, Excel, PowerPoint, email or Zoom meetings. The storage might feel tight compared to higher-end models, but remember—Microsoft 365 allows you to access OneDrive cloud storage which means you can keep your most important files online and free up space on the device.</p>



<p>Battery life is always something to watch out for with cheaper laptops, but HP has managed to keep it respectable here: You’ll have hours of use out of one charge, which should be <strong>sufficient to get you through a school day</strong> or long study session. Add in <strong>preinstalled Windows 11 Home</strong>, and you’re receiving the latest version of Microsoft’s operating system with periodic updates, all for the cheap price.</p>
<p>At $172, this HP laptop is precariously close to “why not?” territory.</p>
