              <p>For most of us, Guitar Hero and Rock Band are just those gimmick games that were briefly popular for a couple years back in high school. But for some of us, it is life. The dream of peripheral-based rhythm gaming isn’t as long dead as you might think. The PDP Riffmaster wireless guitar controller is seeing a hefty sale on Amazon at the moment. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/7014/">Normally sold for $150, it’s now down 33%, saving you a whopping $50. That’s brings it down to an even $100.</a></p>
<p>There are three models of the PDP Riffmaster wireless guitar controller, each designed for Xbox, PlayStation, and Nintendo consoles. The controller is suitable for Rock Band games, as well as Fortnite Festival, though I’m sure there’s someone out there attempting to beat <em>Bloodborne</em> with this thing. Each model is officially licensed for the system its designed for. The Xbox one is also compatible with PC if that’s where you’re looking to play.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/7014/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<p>If you’ve only ever played any of the Guitar Hero or Rock Band games using the controllers that came with the game, then you’ll find this one to be more closely resembling the Rock Band’s guitar controller. The five main buttons take up the entirety of the frets, and they’re also all duplicated higher up on the neck of the guitar if you want to switch up the way you play. The strumming trigger is also more akin to its Rock Band counterpart than it is the Guitar Hero one.</p>
<h2>Designed for Everyone</h2>
<p>The PDP Riffmaster wireless guitar controller is also designed for both righty and lefty guitarists, having a strap attachment available on both sides of the guitar. The buttons being the whole fret also support make playing righty or lefty feel more closely aligned. The strap itself is included with the controller as well.</p>



<p>Built into the front of the guitar controller is both a D-pad as well as a traditional analogue stick for easier navigation. The analogue stick is actually built into the neck of the guitar, while the D-pad is found on its face, beneath where you strum. The controller even has integrated volume controls so you can adjust on the fly, mid-song. And of course, gotta have the whammy bar.</p>
<p>Being a wireless controller, it works off a rechargeable battery. That battery should last you a solid 36 hours of playtime per charge. When playing, it has a 30-range of low latency wireless connection to work with, so feel free to rock out all across your friend’s basement.</p>
<p>When you’re done playing, the controller can even be collapsed for both easy transportation and for more flexibility when it comes to storage.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/amazon-slashes-16-1-portable-gaming-monitor-to-15-6-pricing-hitting-lowest-price-and-selling-fast-2000665165</link>

              <p>A single screen isn’t always enough. You might need to multitask with multiple programs at once, or maybe share your screen with colleagues during a presentation. There are plenty of portable options on the market that can come in handy during situations like this. One of our favorites is the 16.1-inch Arzopa gaming monitor, and Amazon is offering a limited-time chance to grab it for less.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6601/">It’s now sitting at $97, after a sweet 25% off its usual $130 price</a>. This $33 discount isn’t huge, but it still makes the upgrade much more affordable. Act now before the price shoots back up again!</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6601/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Lifelike Picture Quality</h2>
<p>For under $100, you’re getting an impressive 16.1-inch portable monitor that delivers a stunning 1080P FHD high-definition resolution and 106% sRGB gamut, bringing your favorite content to life. You’ll enjoy detailed, vibrant, and lifelike picture quality, whether you’re streaming a show, working on an office project, or gaming with friends. The size is also slightly bigger than the standard 15.6-inch options in this range, so you’ll have more space to work and play comfortably. Additionally, the anti-glare coating makes it easy on the eyes, so extended sessions won’t be a problem.</p>
<p>The screen lets you switch the view between horizontal and vertical modes, based on your needs. Go for the horizontal mode when catching up on tasks, and switch to vertical when you need to read a long document or scroll through social media. Gamers will appreciate an ultra-fast refresh rate of 144Hz that allows for immediate action, resulting in smoother, clearer movement in your favorite titles.</p>



<p>It also features plug-and-play functionality, which means you don’t need to install any dedicated drivers or follow complicated installation processes to get started. There are two fully functional USB Type-C connections and a Mini HDMI port, which you can use to connect the screen to a laptop, Mac, Xbox, PS5, Steam Deck, etc. Once paired with your device, you can prop it up anywhere you want, however you like. That’s thanks to a built-in stand which makes it easy to set up and adjust to your preferred viewing angle. For instance, you can have it upright for when you’re catching up on a work task on your desk, and switch to a more relaxed angle when streaming at night.</p>
<p>In short, if you’ve been looking to add a second screen to your setup without overpaying for one, this deal makes that possible. The 16.1-inch Arzopa portable gaming monitor offers crisp visuals, plus is ultra-lightweight for easy portability. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6601/">On a regular day, you’d pay around $130 to enjoy these features, but the current 25% discount at Amazon lets you do that for just $97.</a> But again, it’s a limited-time discount that wraps up soon. It’s best to get your orders in before it’s too late.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/sony-playstation-ps5-ai-genai-podcast-patent-kratos-aloy-2000665334</link>
            <guid>1423948</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><span>Have you ever sat down and thought about how you’d like a podcast hosted by </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/god-of-war-live-action-series-amazon-kratos-ryan-hurst-2000659874"><span>Kratos</span></a><span> telling you about all the cool games you could be buying and playing on the PlayStation Store? Me neither, but it seems someone at Sony did, as the company has been granted a patent for AI-generated podcasts starring PlayStation characters as a kind of bespoke marketing tool to target players’ specific interests.</span></p> <p><span>The patent (thanks, </span><a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/sony-patents-ai-generated-podcasts-voiced-by-characters-from-its-games/"><i><span>VGC</span></i></a><span>) was granted to Sony last month, and is called “LLM-Based Generative Podcasts for Gamers.” The company applied for the patent back in July 2024, long before we saw some of the other AI-generated performance tech Sony had been working on with the leaked tech demo of an </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/playstation-ai-aloy-ps5-horizon-zero-dawn-1851769086"><span>AI-powered Aloy from </span><i><span>Horizon</span></i><span> in 2025</span></a><span>.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><span>“Video game platforms currently lack the ability to provide unique and targeted content to gamers to update the gamers about things that are happening on the platform,” the patent reads. “There are currently no adequate solutions to the foregoing computer-related, technological problem.”</span></p> <p><span>Sony’s idea to combat this made-up problem is to create a daily AI-generated podcast in which characters like Parappa the Rapper, Ellie, or Jin Sakai give you recaps on your gameplay and updates on games that are out or on the way. This is framed as another way of personalizing the experience, as the character who reads off the marketing copy might be one from a game you’ve played recently, and would pull from your recent play history and friends list to cater the generated podcast to you. Examples in the patent include having someone like Nathan Drake tell you about your friends getting the Platinum in a game and recommending it to you, or having Ratchet keep you posted about patches and updates for the games you’re playing. The characters may also roast you for eating shit in your favorite game.</span></p>

 <p><span>Companies patent things that never actually come to be all the time, and considering how much legal red tape you’d need to get past to use actors’ performances to train these models on, along with </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/sag-aftra-strike-voice-actor-game-darth-vader-1851784189"><span>SAG-AFTRA having recently negotiated AI guardrails</span></a><span> into its contract requiring actors to opt into such arrangements, I have a hard time seeing this ever come to fruition. Even so, this is just another example of a company trying to shoehorn AI into its products to solve problems that don’t exist. Turning your beloved characters into AI slop is another way of diluting your brand, one that Sony </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/playstation-5-2025-ghost-yotei-sales-plus-price-hike-2000653527"><span>has spent the better part of a decade crafting an image of prestige around</span></a><span>. I can’t imagine why the company would fuck that up and damage relationships with actors wary of AI being used to replace them, all for so little benefit.</span></p>

            <title><![CDATA[Anker Offloads 45W Nano USB-C Wall Charger at Record Low on Amazon]]></title>
            <link>https://kotaku.com/anker-offloads-45w-nano-usb-c-wall-charger-at-record-low-on-amazon-2000665169</link>
            <guid>1423864</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>The Anker Nano USB-C Wall Charger takes a regular single-port brick and transforms it into a 45-watt USB-C fast charger that has brains and flexibility. It provides sufficient power to rapidly charge recent iPhone models, compatible iPads, and a large number of other USB-C devices, and it features a front display that shows you exactly what is happening while your equipment is charging. The very compact body makes it easy to place the charger on a strip with multiple other chargers or to toss it into a bag. Additionally, the folding plug rotates, so it will sit neatly even in an odd-shaped outlet.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/7012/">You can head to Amazon and grab the Anker Nano USB-C Wall Charger for just $30, reduced from $40.</a> That represents a savings of $10 and 25% off the original retail price.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/7012/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>A fast-charging wall unit that’ll get all your devices to 100%</h2>
<p>The Anker Nano’s output adjusts the power provided as your battery level changes. When a supported phone is low, the charger delivers as much energy as possible to quickly get you out of the red zone, and once it’s nearly fully charged, it slows power delivery to prevent overheating.</p>
<p>The smart display is located on the front of the charger and converts the charging process from a mysterious activity into one you can easily see. A single tap displays real-time power usage and general status; a double tap alternates between modes; and a long press turns the display around when the charger is attached to a strip or wall outlet, so it can be viewed when it’s plugged in upside-down. The display will also automatically shut off after a brief period of non-use, so it won’t disturb you as you sleep.</p>



<p>While Care Mode is engaged, the charging profile is modified to keep the adapter and phone at a lower temperature than a standard high-output 45W brick would. This is particularly beneficial for those who plan to charge their phones overnight on a nightstand. Over time, gentle charging can help maintain long-term battery health. Having this logic built directly into the wall charger itself eliminates the need to manually toggle through individual application settings to achieve this goal.</p>
<p>Design and compatibility complete the charger. Both prongs on the charger fold into the housing for travel and can be rotated, allowing them to fit tightly in outlets without blocking nearby sockets. A single USB-C port is located on the top of the charger, keeping the design simple. Also, the Nano supports charging of both iPhone and iPad models, Samsung phones, and many other types of USB-C devices. Included in the package are the 45-watt smart display wall charger and a welcome guide. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/7012/">At $30 on sale, down from the usual $40, it’s an easy upgrade over a basic slow cube.</a></p>
