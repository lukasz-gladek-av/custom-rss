Over a year since then, however, there’s been no new substantive info about the upcoming blockbuster and what it will entail. </p><p>There have also been fears that the game could still slip its current fall release window, especially given all of the hype and expectations riding on the sequel’s release. At 210 million copies sold, its decade-old predecessor, <em>GTA 5</em>, is the third best-selling game ever. </p><p> “Look, I think the game is eagerly anticipated both internally and externally,” Zelnick told<em> IGN</em>. “We know that Rockstar seeks perfection. I never claim success before it occurs. I’m fond of saying arrogance is the enemy of continued success, so we’re all running scared and looking over our shoulders and we know that the competition is not asleep. Our whole organization is super excited.”</p><p>The game’s release <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-12-09/-gta-6-release-date-will-decide-much-of-the-2025-game-calendar&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-12-09/-gta-6-release-date-will-decide-much-of-the-2025-game-calendar" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">has also reportedly been a factor</a></span> in other companies being skittish about announcing a release date that accidentally ends up colliding with <em>GTA 6</em>. As of now, the second half of 2025 is a complete mystery as far as what else is coming out and when. Take-Two is one of those companies with a bunch of other games coming out this year. While <em>Civilization 7 </em>is out this month and <em>Mafia: The Old Country</em> arrives sometime in the summer, <em>Borderlands 4</em> is also due out before the end of 2025. </p><p>It remains to be seen whether the popular loot shooter gets pushes out ahead of <em>GTA 6</em> or after, during the tail-end of the year. Whether <em>GTA 6</em> ultimately ends up getting delayed or not could end up being what decides that. </p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Nintendo then teased the feature in the new Switch’s reveal trailer shortly after. Now the potential game-changer has been all but officially announced thanks to a new patent breaking down how  the Joy-Con mouse functionality will work.</p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="196181" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="The Best Reveals From The Game Awards 2023" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="180" data-playlist="196181,196230,194644" data-current="196181"><div><p>The Best Reveals From The Game Awards 2023</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196181/196181_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196181/196181_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196181/196181_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196181/196181_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/21718.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>The patent documents were filed back in 2023 and <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://patentscope.wipo.int/search/en/detail.jsf?docId=WO2025027803&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://patentscope.wipo.int/search/en/detail.jsf?docId=WO2025027803" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">published on Thursday</a></span> before being shared on social media <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://x.com/Wario64/status/1887587009067102593&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://x.com/Wario64/status/1887587009067102593" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">by Wario64</a></span>. “This input device comprises a front surface, an upper surface, a first side surface, a second side surface, a direction input unit, a first upper surface button, and a sensor for mouse operation,” it reads. </p><p>The patent description continues, “The sensor for mouse operation detects reflected light from a detected surface, the light changing by moving over the detected surface in a state in which either the first side surface or the second side surface is placed on the detected surface.”</p><p>This confirms what many fans suspected upon seeing the Joy-Con controllers sliding around a surface on their sides during the announcement trailer last month. Presumably, the “mouse operation” feature will allow some games on Switch 2 to be played with either traditional controller inputs or mouse inputs. </p><p>That could make it ideal for games like <em>Civilization 7</em> and potentially shooters like <em>Fortnite </em>and<em> Call of Duty</em>, which Microsoft is expected to begin porting to the Switch 2 at some point in the future. Other Microsoft shooters like <em>Halo</em> and <em>Doom</em> are also expected to get ported at some point, and the new Joy-Con could let players aim with traditional PC mouse precision while moving and strafing with a controller thumbstick. </p><p>Even more exciting is how Nintendo might find ways to use a dual-mouse feature for creative new gameplay. One of the patent drawings shows both Joy-Con being used as mice simultaneously. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.patreon.com/jeffgerstmann&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.patreon.com/jeffgerstmann" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">On his podcast</a></span>, <em>Giant Bomb</em> co-founder Jeff Gerstmann speculated that dual mice might let players control something like a mech with two reticles for aiming arm-mounted weapons. Or it could be used for some very weird, innovative launch game only Nintendo would think of.
