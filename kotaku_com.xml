The head of Larian Studios, which made <em>Baldur’s Gate 3</em>, thought it was really cool. But Wizards of the Coast, who owns the D&amp;D license? Not so much.

According to a spokesperson for the mod database, Wizards of the Coast was responsible for sending a DMCA takedown notice against the fan content for infringing on its ownership of <em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons,</em> which <em>Baldur’s Gate 3</em> is based on. </p><p> “This is an incredibly creative cross-over to <em>Stardew Valley</em> that the community loves,” <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.pcgamer.com/games/rpg/wizards-of-the-coast-scores-pr-masterstroke-bullies-bg3-stardew-mod-that-had-swen-vinckes-personal-approval-off-the-internet-with-a-dmca/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/rpg/wizards-of-the-coast-scores-pr-masterstroke-bullies-bg3-stardew-mod-that-had-swen-vinckes-personal-approval-off-the-internet-with-a-dmca/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">the rep told <em>PC gamer</em></a></span>, adding that the Larian boss’ original endorsement “was nothing less than we would expect from the Larian CEO, who has been such a refreshing and visionary leader.” They continued, “Hopefully, this is an oversight from WotC, who often use external agencies to hunt down violating content, and they will revert their decision. Fingers crossed for Baldur’s Village.” </p><p>Larian Studios decided to move on to other projects instead of making <em>Baldur’s Gate 4</em>, and an executive at Hasbro, which owns Wizards of the Coast, recently told fans the company is taking its time with the project but will have details to begin sharing soon. “We’re going to take a very measured approach,” VP of digital games Dan Ayoub <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.ign.com/articles/well-hear-more-about-baldurs-gates-future-in-pretty-short-order-hasbro-svp-of-games-says&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/well-hear-more-about-baldurs-gates-future-in-pretty-short-order-hasbro-svp-of-games-says" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">told <em>IGN</em></a></span> earlier this month. “We’ve got a lot of plans, a lot of different ways to go about it. We’re starting to think about, okay, yeah, we’re ready to start dipping toes a little bit and talking about a few things. And I think, in really short order, like I said, again, not to over-tease that point, we’re going to have some other things to talk about around that.”</p><p>Apparently someone at Hasbro or Wizards thinks a fan mashup of <em>BG3</em> and one of the most popular games of all time in a non-competing genre might get in the way of whatever it’s doing with the franchise. Vincke wasn’t impressed with the move. “Free quality fan mods highlighting your characters in other game genres are proof your work resonates and a unique form of word of mouth,” he <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://x.com/LarAtLarian/status/1906765058270540219&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://x.com/LarAtLarian/status/1906765058270540219" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">wrote</a></span> on Monday. “Imho they shouldn’t be treated like commercial ventures that infringe on your property.”<br></p><p>He continued, “Protecting your IP can be tricky but I do hope this gets settled. There are good ways of dealing with this.”<br></p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Above the usual  heavy hitters and longtime classics you’ll spot <em>Schedule I</em>, an open-world, first-person drug-dealing sim developed by one guy that, as I write this, has over 340,000 concurrent players on Steam. </p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="196663" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="The Top 10 Most Played Games On Steam Deck: February 2024 Edition" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="429" data-playlist="196663,194341,194651" data-current="196663"><div><p>The Top 10 Most Played Games On Steam Deck: February 2024 Edition</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196663/196663_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196663/196663_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196663/196663_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196663/196663_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/22220.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p><em>Schedule I</em> was released on March 24 and quickly blew up on Valve’s popular PC gaming storefront. The game launched in early access at the relatively low price point of $20 and, just a week later, it’s one of the biggest games of 2025. On <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://steamdb.info/app/3164500/charts/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://steamdb.info/app/3164500/charts/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">March 3o, during peak weekend play time, SteamDB showed that<em> Schedule I</em></a></span> had an astounding 414,000+ concurrent players on Steam. That’s better than games like <em>Starfield, Grand Theft Auto V, </em>and <em>Destiny 2. </em></p><p>So what is <em>Schedule I</em>? Well, it’s a drug-dealing sim. That’s not a joke or me being silly, that’s straight up what the game is. Here’s <em>Schedule I</em>’s Steam store description: </p><blockquote data-type="BlockQuote"><p>You’re a small-time drug dealer rolling into a fresh town with no cash, no product and no connections. Build your drug empire from the ground up in the grungy west-coast city of Hyland Point. Contend against intensifying law enforcement and deadly cartel competitors to expand your empire and reach the peak of the underworld.</p></blockquote><p>Players have to manufacture their own drugs, transport them, sell the illegal goods, and occasionally fight other dealers and criminals. The game is currently only available on Steam and can be played either solo or with a buddy via co-op. </p><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/Schedule_I/comments/1jkigky/comment/mjzluub/?context=3&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Schedule_I/comments/1jkigky/comment/mjzluub/?context=3" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">According to the Reddit posts from Tyler</a></span>, the developer behind <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.scheduleonegame.com/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.scheduleonegame.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>Schedule I</em></a></span>, the drug-dealing sim has been in development for <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/CoOpGaming/comments/1hx5yvn/comment/m66kq1r/?context=3&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/CoOpGaming/comments/1hx5yvn/comment/m66kq1r/?context=3" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">over three years and was created mostly by himself</a></span>. </p><p>When asked how it feels to have a game blow up on Steam like this and become one of the biggest hits of 2025, Tyler had this to say via Reddit: </p><p>“Honestly it’s amazing but pretty overwhelming,” said the <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.scheduleonegame.com/presskit/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.scheduleonegame.com/presskit/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">solo dev</a></span>.  “I never expected this kind of response! At the moment I’m just trying to stay focused and get patches out ASAP. Also looking forward to getting started on content updates as soon as all major bugs are patched.” </p><p>When asked about porting the game to consoles, Tyler seemed interested but wasn’t sure if Microsoft and Sony would allow the game on their digital stores. </p><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://store.steampowered.com/app/3164500/Schedule_I/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3164500/Schedule_I/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Reviews for <em>Schedule I</em></a></span> are extremely positive and most players seem happy with the content available at launch and are excited for the game to expand via promised updates that will arrive over the next few weeks and months. </p><p>In a time when massive games developed by hundreds of people and costing <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/concord-shutting-down-closing-servers-refunds-ps5-1851638566?_gl=1*1ssvoho*_ga*NzE0NzM5NTc5LjE3Mjk4Njg5MzU.*_ga_V4QNJTT5L0*MTc0MzQ0MDQ0NC4yNzguMS4xNzQzNDU1NDA0LjE2LjAuMA..&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/concord-shutting-down-closing-servers-refunds-ps5-1851638566?_gl=1*1ssvoho*_ga*NzE0NzM5NTc5LjE3Mjk4Njg5MzU.*_ga_V4QNJTT5L0*MTc0MzQ0MDQ0NC4yNzguMS4xNzQzNDU1NDA0LjE2LjAuMA..">tens of millions of dollars (or more) are flopping</a></span>, its nice to see something succeeding and proving that you don’t need hyper-realistic graphics or live-service features to succeed. Instead, you can just make a game that offers players a unique or enticing experience and sell it at a fair price.  And if you get lucky and people like it, you might end up with one of the biggest games of 2025 and beat AAA studios and publishers. <br></p><p> .<br></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
