Today, Paramount has released the second trailer for the film, and we get to see a little bit more of Shadow and the returning cast, as well as get a better sense of how the movie will adapt the story of <em>Sonic Adventure 2</em>.</p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="196626" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="Who Is The Best Hang In Unicorn Overlord?

Gerald was always an interesting inclusion for an adaptation of <em>Sonic Adventure 2</em>, as the Dreamcast platformer’s story was set entirely after his death. But Carrey seems to be playing him a bit, uh, sillier than he’s seen <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/sonic-x-shadow-generations-review-levels-powers-1851676560&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/sonic-x-shadow-generations-review-levels-powers-1851676560">in most <em>Sonic </em>media</a></span>, which I’m not thrilled by out of context. So maybe this is all in the interest of bringing some levity to the otherwise dark events of Shadow’s backstory. </p><p>Otherwise, the trailer shows that a lot of elements from <em>Sonic Adventure 2</em> will show up in the movie, including what looks like the Space Colony Ark space station Shadow was born on, and his use of the Eclipse Cannon to destroy part of the moon. It also gives him a gun as a callback to his self-titled game, <em>Shadow the Hedgehog</em>. I never thought I’d see the day an officially-licensed <em>Sonic </em>thing would give Shadow firearms again. But here we are. It’s the Year of Shadow, baby.</p><p>Check out the full trailer below:</p><p><em>Sonic the Hedgehog 3 </em>will apparently include a big tease about what comes next for the franchise, and even though the series uses up one of its biggest possible reveals in Shadow, there’s still <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/sonic-3-post-credits-scene-amy-rouge-metal-chaos-silver-1851698899&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/sonic-3-post-credits-scene-amy-rouge-metal-chaos-silver-1851698899">a lot of territory the movies haven’t covered yet</a></span>.

I’m still holding out hope that Rouge might secretly be in <em>Sonic the Hedgehog 3</em> and this is a <em>Spider-Man: No Way Home </em>situation in which marketing and trailers are purposefully omitting her, to preserve the surprise for moviegoers.

There’s a reason your PS5 is the size of a small building, and it’s not aesthetic. And sure, in a few years’ time, such tech will likely be small enough to fit into something handheld, but by then the expectations for graphics will be photorealistic 5D liquid-pixels and we’ll be back to exactly where we are now.</p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
