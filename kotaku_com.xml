            <link>https://kotaku.com/backup-your-data-with-a-5tb-external-hard-drive-for-just-125-for-black-friday-2000647687</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>With Black Friday here, tons of deals have now gone live across the web. If you’re trying to save some cash on some upgrades to your kitchen, some new toys, or some new tech, now’s the time to get shopping. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6037/">If you’re in need of more storage with your computer, Amazon has the WD 5TB My Passport Ultra external hard drive one sale for up to 19% off.</a> There are multiple size options to choose from, but the only ones part of the ongoing deal is the 2TB, the 4TB, and the 5TB. The 2TB has come down by $10 to just $80. The 4TB has come down by $15 to $125. However, the 5TB has come down by a significant $30 which also brings it to just $125. So there’s no reason to go with the 4TB right now as you can get an extra 1TB of storage for the same price.</p>
<p>This external hard drive is a great way to expand your device’s storage capacity quickly and easily. The My Passport Ultra can connect to your laptop or PC over USB-C. In order to ensure compatibility with older machines, a USB-A adapter is included.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6037/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<p>The drive is made to be durable and travel friendly. It has a sleek exterior casing made from anodized metal, offering your stored data protection when on the go.</p>
<p>Do note that this is a hard drive, not a solid state drive. Western Digital doesn’t list the exact specs for read and write speeds of its My Passport Ultra external hard drive, but don’t expect it to compare to the speeds of some newer SSDs. If you’re someone who finds themselves working on massive creative projects like editing video, this likely won’t be sufficient for you. It can still provide utility as a backup for your projects, but I wouldn’t recommended working directly from it for big videos timelines.</p>
<p>Likewise, this hard drive isn’t meant for gaming. Modern AAA titles require some pretty fast load times, so you won’t have any luck trying to play games from this. It’s also not compatible with consoles, using it with your PlayStation 5 or Xbox Series X. It may work with older consoles, or even simply for game storage with the the current generation stuff. Some external hard drives are able to be formatted to store PS5 or Xbox Series X games, but require that you move them back to your internal storage in order to play them. Though, again, Western Digital makes no mention of gaming here on the product page so your mileage may vary with this one.</p>



<h2>Scheduled Backups</h2>
<p>It seems this drive is primarily geared toward those in need of some place to backup their files. The included Acronis True Image for Western Digital allows you to even schedule backups. You can just keep the hard drive plugged into your laptop or PC and have it backup your files at regularly scheduled intervals.</p>
<p>The hard driver is equipped with security features which help protect against ransomware. You can fortify your important applications and help prevent data loss from ransomware attacks.</p>
<p>If you’re worried about someone malicious getting their hands on your files, or simply would feel a better peace of mind if no one could access but you. you can enable password protection at the hard drive level. You data will be locked behind a password of your choice with 256-bit AES hardware encryption.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Amazon Pushes Anker’s 3-in-1 MagSafe Charger to a Record Low Amid a Wave of Apple Deals, Despite Being Newly Released]]></title>
            <link>https://kotaku.com/cut-down-on-cable-clutter-with-this-3-in-1-prime-magsafe-charger-for-apple-devices-2000648208</link>
            <guid>1367251</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Topping all your essentials up in one go shouldn’t be a hassle. If you’re done dealing with cable clutter and plugging different devices into different outlets across the room, it’s time for an upgrade.</p>
<p>Anker makes some of our favorite charging solutions, and this Black Friday is a great time to upgrade your setup with one for less. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6036/">Right now, Apple users can grab its 3-in-1 Prime MagSafe Charger for iPhone, Apple Watch, and AirPods for just $150, down from $230</a>. You’re saving an impressive 35% on a wireless charging solution that’s safe to use, plus much faster and efficient than other options in the same range. It’s also its lowest price we have seen on it since launch.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6036/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Smart, Plus Powerful</h2>
<p>The 25W ultra-fast charging makes it around 6 times faster than most similar options out there, while TEC cooling keeps heat-related slowdowns at bay. An iPhone 17 Pro can hit 50% in just 22 minutes, so it’s much quicker than a standard charger. Support for iPhone, AirPods, and Apple Watch means you can juice all three up without the usual wait and clutter. Just toss them on before dozing off, and wake up to everything ready to take on the day with you. It also makes it great for when you’re in a rush and don’t have the time to plug everything in separately. Best of all, you won’t forget any of them, since all will be sitting right there next to each other.</p>
<p>The phone charger is flexible, and you can place your iPhone both horizontally and vertically; however you like. Planning to watch something at it charges? Go for the horizontal mode and let it double as a stand. There’s a built-in 1.65-inch HD display on the charging station to keep you in the loop about power, temperature, and charging status. The screen is customizable, and even shares safety alerts if something feels off.</p>



<p>Three power modes deliver different power levels for different routines. Boost Mode offers high-power charging for quick top-ups, and the Ice Mode keeps the devices cool as you use them while they charge. Finally, the Sleep Mode disables cooling and dims the display for quiet, safe overnight charging. Switching between the modes is made easy with the dedicated app, which also lets you schedule day and night times to enter or exit the sleep mode automatically. You can use it to customize your screensaver and view charging details just as well.</p>
<p>ActiveShield 5.0 performs over 10 million temperature checks a day to prevent overheating and maintain the battery health of your devices. As for compatibility, the charger plays nicely with iPhone Series 12 through 17, almost all the old and new Apple Watch series, plus AirPods 2, 3, 4, Pro, Pro2, and Pro 3. Just note that it’s not compatible with iPhone 16e. The box comes with the charger itself, a 65W GaN foldable adapter, a 5 ft USB-C to USB-C cable (10,000-bend tested), a welcome guide, 24-month warranty for some extra peace of mind. That’s everything you need to get started with it right away.</p>
<p>If you’ve been on the lookout for a smarter, no-fuss charging solution for all your important gadgets, this 3-in-1 Anker Prime MagSafe charger does a great job at that. It provides the power they need, plus maintains your battery health while it’s at it. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6036/">This deal takes $80 off its $230 price, letting you grab it for just $150.</a> The offer applies to both white and black color options, so you can pick the one that suits your aesthetics the best.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Google Pixel Buds Pro 2 Is Going Even Lower Than Its Planned Black Friday Price to Compete With AirPods and Galaxy Buds]]></title>
            <link>https://kotaku.com/google-pixel-buds-pro-2-drop-to-its-lowest-price-yet-for-black-friday-2000647626</link>
            <guid>1367236</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>With Black Friday happening, retailers have push the go button in the backend of their websites to have all their deals go live right now, ahead of schedule. If you’re still hunting for the right gift this holiday season for a friend, family member, or loved one, right now seems to be the best time to do so. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6032/">Amazon happens to have Google’s latest noise-cancelling premium earbuds—the Pixel Buds Pro 2— on sale for its lowest price yet</a>. The in-ear headphones and charging case normally clock in at $229, but ahead of November’s massive sales days, the price has come down to just $169. That 26% discount ends up saving you a whole $60 for a limited time.</p>
<p>The Google Pixel Buds Pro 2 come in five different color option, three of which are lucky enough to be part of the ongoing early Black Friday sale. You can chose between hazel, peony, or porcelain. Wintergreen and moonstone are either out of stock or absent from the discount. The color you choose only affects the buds themselves, as all color options come with the same white case with black interior.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6032/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<p>These earbuds are being toted by Google as its most comfortable earbuds yet. They are small, light, and have a secure fit in any ear size or shape. You can use a twist-to-adjust stabilizer which locks your earbuds in place which is great for a high-intensity workout. Then twist the other way to loosen them a bit for all-day comfort.</p>
<p>What separates the Pro model from the standard Pixel Buds is support for noise cancellation. The Buds Pro 2 are able to silence unwanted sounds from your surroundings so you can focus in only hearing only what you want to hear, be it music, a podcast, or audiobook. Active noise cancellation is enhanced further with the help of Googles Silent Seal 2.0 which is able to cancel up to twice as much noise as the original Buds Pro.</p>



<h2>Conversation Detection</h2>
<p>Now what happened when you don’t want to eliminate those environmental sounds anymore? Like maybe you’ve been waiting in line for Starbucks—kicking it to “Radio” by Bershy on loop, which you discovered from the awesome soundtrack of <em>Dispatch</em>—and now you’re up next to order. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6032/">The Google Pixel Buds Pro 2</a> are equipped with Conversation Detection. This will automatically pause your music and switch your earbuds to transparency mode when you start talking. Transparency mode basically filters in outside sounds in through the in-ear speakers, and you can activate it just by speaking. That means you don’t have to take out you earbuds, nor do you even need to awkward hold or tap while trying to strike up a conversation.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/lego-christmas-tree-hit-80k-sales-this-black-friday-festive-set-now-goes-for-peanuts-2000648384</link>
            <guid>1367212</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Christmas approaches rapidly and LEGO rushes to clear remaining holiday inventory before the season passes and these seasonal sets lose immediate relevance. The <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5554/">Christmas tree set just dropped to $25 from $44, hitting a record-low 44% discount for Black Friday</a> on Amazon. If you want a compact Christmas tree that survives annual storage cycles without shedding needles, wilting branches or requiring disposal after the holidays, this is a great investment.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5554/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>2-in-1 Design</h2>
<p>The set lets you build either <strong>one big Christmas tree display or two smaller mini trees</strong>, depending on how much space you have and what you like to decorate with. The <strong>bigger version is more than 11 inches tall</strong> and makes it a great choice for mantel displays, dining table centerpieces, or office desk decorations that really stand out. The dual mini tree option makes one 9-inch tree and one 6-inch tree. This lets you display them together with other decorations or spread holiday cheer throughout several rooms.</p>



<p>Each type of tree has <strong>intricate decorations, candles, and yellow star toppers</strong> that give LEGO’s unique blocky style a classic Christmas tree look. The ornaments use colored round pieces that look like glass baubles, and the candles use special pieces to make shapes that are easy to recognize, even though LEGO’s shapes are limited. <strong>The yellow star on top of each tree</strong> is made in the same five-pointed way that every Christmas tree needs, which gives it a classic look.</p>
<p>Building things is a fun activity that can be done alone or with family during the holidays when relatives want to do more than just eat and talk, and kids 12 and older can build things on their own using clear, illustrated instructions. The moderate number of pieces and easy-to-follow assembly instructions <strong>make it possible to finish in 1 to 2 hours</strong>.</p>



<p>The small size works in places where full-size trees don’t work like apartments, dorm rooms, office cubicles, or homes with aggressive pets and curious toddlers, where regular trees can be dangerous. Put them on desks without taking up too much space, on mantels next to other decorations without crowding, or on dining tables as centerpieces that spark conversation.</p>
<p>The <strong>gift potential is broad because it appeals to a wide range of people</strong>. Connecting kids, teens and adults who love LEGO and like to build complicated things that look like holiday decorations. Kids get fun building projects that last, teens like Instagram-worthy decor to make their dorm rooms feel more like home, and adults know that quality home accents are worth showing off all year long, not just during the holidays.</p>
<p>The aggressive 44% Black Friday discount from $44 to $25 makes LEGO’s Christmas tree set cost less than many holiday decorations that can only be used once and then thrown away. If you want Christmas decorations that will last for decades and provide fun and conversation, this is the deal for you.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/dji-osmo-pocket-3-creator-combo-2000648172</link>
            <guid>1367209</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Vlogging cameras, especially those offering incredible stability and quality video, both day and night, usually sit well over $800. DJI makes some of our favorite vlogging and action cameras out there, and all thanks to Black Friday, picking up one today doesn’t cost an arm and a leg.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6033/">We just spotted the DJI Osmo Pocket 3 creator combo going for $669 on Amazon right now.</a> It typically sits around $979, so you can save more than $300 on it if you act right now. The deal is available to all shoppers, whether you’ve got the Prime subscription or not.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6033/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Stable, High-Quality Footage</h2>
<p>It’s a tiny, travel-friendly vlogging that fits in your palm and slips into your pocket for easy portability. Superior stability comes from Pocket 3’s advanced 3-axis mechanical stabilization, while ActiveTrack 6.0 keeps you in focus at all times. Trying out a new dance move or chasing a furry friend around, you can bid shaky, headache-inducing footage goodbye. The camera even locks onto your subject, which can come in handy when filming some action-packed sequences.</p>
<p>The built-in 2-inch full-color OLED rotatable touchscreen moves both horizontally and vertically to give you the perfect shots. When it comes to picture quality, the camera records in 4K resolution at an impressive 120fps. There’s a 1-inch CMOS sensor to capture clear highlight-shadow details, meaning you will be able to show the world what you’ve been up to even after the shadows fall. It’s smart enough to fine-tune exposure for different skin tones on its own, giving you a glow like never before. Pair this with background bokeh that makes the subject stand out, and you’ll have stunning, professional videos ready to be uploaded on YouTube right away. Speaking of YouTube, you can also use the camera to live stream on different platforms, and even use it for online meetings as a webcam. Basically, it takes care of all your video needs, both personal and professional, like a pro.</p>



<p>Sound quality is another strong selling point. Pocket 3 actively reduces background noise to capture what you’re saying clearly, even in noisy, chaotic settings. The sound is pretty solid on its own, but you can always pair the camera with a compatible DJI microphone for a more premium experience.</p>
<p>Battery life is impeccable. A single charge lets you film in 1090p/24fps for over 2.5 hours; perfect for longer journeys where you want to take your online family along. Recharging won’t take long either, as Pocket 3 hits 80% in just 16 minutes. Best of all, tweaking settings and editing the content won’t be a hassle, thanks to the dedicated smartphone app. The platform lets you play around with filters, plus convert 3-second videos into photos on iOS devices.</p>
<p>Included in the box are the Osmo Pocket 3 starting set, the DJI Mic 2 Transmitter, battery handle, Osmo mini Tripod, and more. The battery charger, however, is sold separately. All things considered, if you’ve been on the lookout for a portable camera that makes it easy to record your adventures and share your everyday life with the world, the Pocket 3 Creator Combo is an excellent option to consider.<a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6033/"> On a regular day, it would run you around $979, but this rare Black Friday deal drops the price to just $669</a>. We know it’s still a bit of an investment, but one that’s definitely going to pay for itself in the long run. Just be sure to get your orders in quick, as discounts this massive don’t stick around for long.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Amazon Offloads All Flagship Phones This Black Friday, Including OnePlus 13 Now at New Record Low]]></title>
            <link>https://kotaku.com/amazon-offloads-all-flagship-phones-this-black-friday-including-oneplus-13-now-at-new-record-low-2000648375</link>
            <guid>1367182</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Black Friday’s main day arrives with Amazon delivering massive discounts across every product category to maximize shopper satisfaction. iPhone 17 models are still absent from Amazon’s catalog but flagship Android devices receive substantial markdowns <strong>including the Galaxy S25 Ultra, Google Pixel 10, and OnePlus 13</strong>.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6045/">OnePlus 13 costs $799 in its 512GB configuration during Black Friday on Amazon, down from $999</a> and hits a record-low price that explains its bestseller status. The 20% discount makes flagship specs (including Snapdragon 8 Elite processor, 6,000mAh battery, 120Hz QHD+ display and Hasselblad camera system) accessible at pricing that approached mid-tier phones.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6045/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Snapdragon 8 Elite Performance That Rules</h2>
<p>The Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Elite processor is the <strong>best Android mobile silicon out there</strong>. It has maximum clock speeds of 4.32GHz and is made using cutting-edge 3nm technology which gives it desktop-level performance, and it can handle demanding games at their highest settings, professional photo and video editing, and extreme multitasking across dozens of apps without the slowdowns that happen with less powerful processors.</p>



<p>The <strong>6.82-inch ProXDR display has a QHD+ resolution of 3168 x 1440 pixels</strong> and an <strong>adaptive refresh rate of 120Hz</strong> that smoothly switches between 1Hz for static content and 120Hz for scrolling or gaming. The LTPO technology makes this variable refresh possible while also making the battery last longer by automatically adjusting based on the type of content, and the ProXDR name means that the screen is brighter with a peak brightness of up to 4,500 nits for HDR content.</p>
<p>Dolby Vision support makes video from Netflix, YouTube, and Disney+ look amazing by giving it a lot of contrast. The 10-bit color depth shows over 1 billion colors, so there are no banding issues with smooth gradients, and the display is just as good for work as it is for play with clear text and detailed spreadsheets, bright colors, and deep blacks.</p>
<p>The huge <strong>6,000mAh battery is one of the biggest in flagship phones and really lasts for two days of normal use</strong>, not just the optimistic marketing claims that say you need to use airplane mode and not much else. Heavy users who stream video, play games and use apps all the time can go full days without worrying about their batteries dying. Moderate users can go two evenings before needing to charge their phones. The <strong>80W SuperVOOC wired charging fully charges the battery in about 35 minutes</strong>&nbsp;so you don’t have to wait until the next day to charge it. Instead, you can charge it during your lunch break or morning routine. The 50W AirVOOC wireless charging is as fast as many wired charging options and lets you charge your phone at your desk or nightstand without having to deal with cords in the dark.</p>



<p>The<strong> fifth-generation Hasselblad camera system has three cameras with 50MP sensors on the main, ultra-wide, and telephoto lenses,</strong> and gives you a lot of options for shooting. The main sensor captures incredible detail thanks to its large 1/1.4-inch size, which lets in more light than smaller sensors in other phones. This makes it work better in low light and gives it a shallower depth of field.</p>
<p>The ultra-wide lens handles wide-open spaces with little edge distortion, and the telephoto lens lets you zoom in on things that are far away without losing quality, which is a problem with phones that only crop. <strong>Hasselblad’s color science makes pictures that look real</strong> with accurate skin tones and balanced saturation, instead of the over-processed look that phones that try to look good on social media have.</p>
<p>OnePlus’s<strong> custom interface for Android 15 with OxygenOS</strong> combines the clean look of stock Android with useful features like gesture navigation, gaming mode, and a wide range of theme options. The interface stays fast and responsive because it doesn’t have much bloatware and manages resources well, which keeps it from slowing down like heavily skinned Android versions do. OnePlus promises to give the phone four years of major Android updates and five years of security patches.</p>
<p>The 512GB model is on sale for a record-low price of $799 on Black Friday, down from the usual price of $999. This makes OnePlus’s flagship specs competitive with mid-range phones that cost about the same but have much better performance, display quality, battery life, and camera capabilities.</p>

              <p>Meta launched a second generation of Ray-Ban smart glasses with incremental improvements but the original model remains compelling through proven functionality and dramatically lower pricing. The <strong>Gen 1 Ray-Ban Meta featuring 12MP camera, open-ear speakers, and AI assistant integration</strong> delivers the core smart glasses experience without the premium that newest hardware commands.</p>
<p>The price gap tells the story clearly: Gen 2 models cost $410 while these <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6031/">Gen 1 Wayfarers hit $262 during Black Friday on Amazon (down from $329) which is roughly 40% savings for hardware</a> that differs minimally in daily use. <strong>All coloris and frame styles</strong> receive identical discounting and the<strong> #1 bestseller status in tech glasses</strong> validates that buyers love it.</p>

<h2>12MP Camera That Shows Different Angles</h2>
<p>With the built-in 12MP camera, <strong>you can take pictures and videos hands-free from your exact point of view</strong>: This makes content that smartphones can’t make without awkward arm extensions or obvious filming. Parents keep track of their kids’ soccer games, recitals, and everyday moments by looking them in the eye and being present instead of watching through phone screens. Perspective shots that show what you really saw instead of what cameras picked up from hand-held positions that were slightly off from your line of sight make travel photography more real.</p>



<p><strong>Video recording can last up to 60 seconds per clip in 1080p resolution</strong>, and this is long enough to capture important moments without using too much storage space or battery life that would come with unlimited recording. Birthday cake presentations, scenic overlooks, and quick tutorials all fit easily into the 60-second window. This limit encourages people to film on purpose instead of filming for hours and hours and hours of footage that needs to be edited. The Meta View app automatically syncs the captured content to your phone, keeping everything organized without the need for manual file management or card readers.</p>
<p><strong>Open-ear speakers send sound</strong> in a way that only you can hear at normal volumes: This lets you listen privately without the isolation or discomfort that comes with wearing earbuds for a long time. You can still hear podcast episodes, directions, phone calls, and music while being aware of conversations, traffic, and other sounds that are important for safety. <strong>This technology is great for walking, biking, or any situation where complete audio isolation could be dangerous</strong> or lead to bad behavior.</p>



<p>Meta’s software lets <strong>you use voice commands to control photos, calls, messages, and information queries</strong> without having to touch your phone. You can ask the glasses to take a picture, make a call, send a message, or answer factual questions by speaking naturally, which is easier than trying to use your phone. The hands-free feature is useful when cooking, working out, or doing anything else where it’s hard or impossible to reach your phone.</p>
<p><strong>Ray-Ban’s classic look is kept with the iconic Wayfarer style</strong> which is better than the obvious tech-forward designs that scream “smart glasses” and cause problems in social situations. The matte black frames and polarized gradient graphite lenses make these look like high-end sunglasses first and wearable technology second. This means they can be worn in both professional and social settings where tech that stands out is not appropriate.</p>
<p><strong>The battery lasts through full days of moderate use</strong> which includes taking a few photos, making a few videos, streaming music, and making calls without having to charge it in the middle of the day. The charging case that comes with it lets you charge it more than once on trips that last more than one day when there aren’t many wall outlets available.</p>
<p>There is a $148 difference between the Gen 1 models, which cost $262, and the Gen 2 models, which cost $410, and most users won’t even notice the improvements in their normal use. This record-low price makes smart glasses available without the usual trade-offs or extra costs for early adopters.</p>

              <p>The biggest shopping event of the year is almost here, and you know what that means; saving big on items that rarely go on sale. It’s especially a great time to treat yourself to some Apple products, since we’re spotting iPads, audio gear, and even MacBooks dropping to their lowest ever prices.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6034/">One of the best discounts live right now is the Apple AirPods 4 with ANC marked down to just $99.99.</a> These typically retail for $179, so you’re saving a whopping nearly $80 on the pair. These have dipped to around $130 during past sales, but $99.99 is the lowest we’ve seen them go in a long time. Even crazier? <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6035/">The non-ANC AirPods 4 are nearly 50% off at just 69, which is an insane deal for the latest model.&nbsp;</a>The deal is open to all shoppers, whether you have a Prime subscription or not.</p>
<p>It’s best to get your orders in fast, as we’re not expecting the deal to stick around for long.</p>

<h2>Adaptive Noise Cancelation for an Immersive Experience</h2>
<p>Apple unveiled its AirPods 4 last year, after redesigning the pair for exceptional all-day comfort and greater stability. The redefined contour makes for a better fit, while the shorter stem keeps the frame minimal. The build is responsive, meaning you can just press the earbuds to control music and manage calls.</p>
<p>The pair is packed with Apple’s powerful H2 chip to unlock an immersive, rich audio experience with two modes; Active Noise Cancelation and Transparency. ANC blocks background noise and chatter, letting you vibe to your favorite songs or listen to podcasts without distractions. It’s great for noisy, chaotic public places where you just can’t seem to focus on what’s playing. Putting the buds on will disconnect you from the outside world, making it feel like you’re in a quiet room even when you’re packed into a subway.</p>
<p>Transparency mode does the opposite. It lets some ambient sound in, so that you can stay aware of what’s happening around while still enjoying high-quality audio. It’s better for public settings where you don’t want to miss when someone tries to interact. Even better, there’s Conversation Awareness that automatically lowers the volume of what’s playing when someone talks to you. You won’t have to awkwardly take the earbuds out just to hear the other person properly.</p>
<p>Spatial Audio with dynamic head tracking is supported, too. It places audio all around you for a 3D experience, letting you enjoy your favorite movies and TV shows better.</p>



<p>Voice/video calls get a boost with Voice Isolation, a feature that reduces background noise while clarifying yours. Catch up with friends on the go, or hop on meetings in a cafe without having to repeat yourself or constantly apologizing for the background noise. It plays nicely with Siri, so you can use the voice assistant for hands-free convenience throughout the day. Just say “Hey Siri”, and ask it to play music, make calls, or check your schedule. It’s helpful when you’re behind the wheel and don’t want to take your attention off the road, or even when both your hands are busy typing and picking up the phone would break your flow.</p>
<p>On a single charge, AirPods 4 give you around 5 hours of listening in the standard mode, while up to 4 hours with ANC on. Drop them back into the charging case, and your total extends to 30 hours. The pair is also IP54-rated dust, sweat, and water resistant. Intense workouts in the gym or a few splashes here and there won’t affect the functionality.</p>
<p>All things considered, AirPods 4 are some of the best wireless earbuds out there. You’re getting impressive sound, two listening modes, and a reliable battery life, <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6034/">all for just $99.99 (ANC)</a> and <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6035/">$69 (without ANC) right now.</a></p>
