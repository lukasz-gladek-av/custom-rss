              <p>A new report claims that following high-profile examples of rich people being killed or robbed, the wealthy elite are more nervous than ever about poor people or criminals robbing them, or worse. To defend against this, many are turning their multi-million dollar mansions into spaces that closely resemble <em>Hitman</em> levels.</p> <p><a href="https://www.wsj.com/real-estate/luxury-homes/luxury-home-security-aca080d7">A new <em>Wall Street Journal</em> report</a> shows that a lot of the richest people in the United States are on edge after events like the <a href="https://www.rollingstone.com/culture/rs-gaming/among-us-luigi-mangione-unitedhealthcare-murder-1235199846/">assassination of UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson</a> in New York City in 2024 and the shooting of Blackstone executive Wesley LePatner and others in 2025. There have also been some high-profile burglaries, including the homes of Brad Pitt, Nicole Kidman, and Kansas City Chiefs star QB Patrick Mahomes. Reportedly many rich celebs and executives are also nervous about sites that <a href="https://kotaku.com/half-life-3-leak-sgf-2025-rumor-gabe-newell-yacht-1851783832">let people track private jets and yachts</a>. To ease their fears, many of the richest people around are spending millions on adding security features like laser grids, moats, armed guards, and AI-powered cameras to their mansions.</p>

 <p>“Prior to the wide use of social media, most CEOs—whether they’re in private equity, finance or tech—no one knew their names or what they looked like, with few exceptions,” said Miami luxury real estate agent Danny Hertzberg. “Now, people are tracking them.”</p> <p>One former tech mogul turned real estate agent showed off a $15 million mansion compound in Arizona that included 32 “casino-grade cameras” and a “laser intrusion detection system” around the home’s large perimeter. The house’s front door is made out of three-inch-thick solid steel and includes 13 deadbolts. Around the house are also sour orange trees with four-inch spikes intended to deter people from sneaking around. And in front of all that is a moat. Meanwhile, inside the house is a reinforced concrete bunker with a 2,000-pound door and an air filtration system built to extremely high standards.</p>

 <p>And this is far from the only mansion being turned into a challenging <em>Hitman</em> level. <em>The Wall Street Journal</em> says roughly 45 percent of high-end homes sold last year included a reference to privacy or security. That’s up from 38 percent in 2024.</p>

 <p>In Vegas, a luxury design firm says clients are now spending $100,000 to $1.5 million just on security features like safe rooms and cameras. In Florida, another building company is working to incorporate biometric access, facial recognition, and iris scanning into its security systems.</p> <p>Meanwhile, in places like Beverly Hills, developers are contracting security firm Arsec Group to provide 24/7 armed guard for their latest collection of high-end homes inside a gated community. Mikey Arana, founder of Arsec, says many of his clients in California are increasingly worried about being followed and robbed after a night out on the town wearing pricey clothes and jewelry. &nbsp;The armed guards carry 9mm pistols and observe the property via infrared cameras.</p>

 <p>“Sometimes, unfortunately, the only way to stop violent action is with a violent response,” said Arana.</p>

              <p>We first learned that the frosty survival game <em>The Long Dark&nbsp;</em>was getting a sequel <a href="https://kotaku.com/game-awards-2024-trailers-announcements-world-premieres-1851720032/24">during 2024’s Game Awards</a>. Called&nbsp;<em>Blackfrost: The Long Dark 2</em>, the follow-up to 2017’s excellent first-person game about surviving in the Canadian wilderness was said to be coming to early access in 2026. That’s no longer the case, with developer Hinterland’s founder Raphael van Lierop now saying it won’t be out in any form this year, and as a consequence 10 full-time developers and four contractors from the studio are being let go.</p> <p>“I’m sad to share the news that I’ve made the difficult decision today to part ways with 10 of our cherished colleagues,” begins a statement from van Lierop <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/rvanlierop_some-very-sad-news-from-hinterland-today-share-7427536054947045376-f305/">posted to LinkedIn</a> (thanks&nbsp;<a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/hinterland-confirms-layoffs-after-delaying-the-long-dark-sequel"><em>Game Developer</em></a>). “We also will not extend some existing fixed-term contracts when they expire, impacting another 4 team members, bringing the total affected to 14.”</p>

 <p>The reasons given allude to wider industry issues, but suggest the primary issue is that <em>Blackfrost</em> won’t be in a state to enter early access this year, which van Lierop says “means pushing significant expected revenue out as well, and these layoffs will help us preserve the financial resources required to get the game to launch, as well as to continue supporting our other games.”</p> <figure id="attachment_2000668230" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000668230"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000668230">© Hinterland / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p>The original&nbsp;<em>The Long Dark</em> was first released in its earliest form in 2014, following a successful Kickstarter the previous year. One of the rare examples of a truly purposeful early access development, the shiver-inducing first-person survival sim then released regular significant updates, each developing its core ideas in new and interesting directions, until its splendid 2017 final version. And all of them ensured you were always likely <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-long-dark-impres-oh-ive-been-eaten-by-a-wolf">to be eaten by a wolf</a>. Its only stumble was the initial addition of its Wintermute story mode, the first two of the five chapters failing to win many over, but even these were later recreated in a far better form. Astonishingly, the fifth chapter still isn’t out, <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/305620/view/582781208710089005?l=english">last said to be arriving on March 31, 2026</a>, and van Lierop says the new layoffs will not affect its release. Planned updates for the original game that are scheduled to appear this year are also apparently unaffected.</p>

 <p>“This is a heavy, heavy day for Hinterland,” says the CEO, “and our hearts are with all those affected by today’s layoff. I’m sorry to have had to let these people go.” The statement says efforts have been made to help those affected find new work, adding, “Any development studio in the industry would be fortunate to have any single one of these team members. We are a weaker studio for losing them, and they will be sorely missed.”</p>

 <p>Being a weaker studio will surely further hinder development of <em>Blackfrost</em>, not least given the intention was never to release a finished game this year, but rather its earliest playable version. Hopefully some additional money will come in to Hinterland with today’s news that the original <em>The Long Dark</em> is finally returning to GOG, after <a href="https://www.gog.com/forum/general/the_long_dark_removal/page1">being mysteriously pulled from the store in 2018</a>. It’s <a href="https://www.gog.com/en/game/the_long_dark">on the freshly independent PC gaming store with a 25-percent discount for the next week</a>.</p>
