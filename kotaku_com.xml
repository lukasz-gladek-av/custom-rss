              <p>Nintendo recently launched the much-anticipated successor to its highly successful Nintendo Switch console earlier this summer. For those looking to upgrade, the new Nintendo Switch 2 is available this holiday season for $450. However, if you missed out on the original Switch, or if you’re not in a rush to adopt the latest version, picking up a previous model could be a smart choice. Currently, Amazon is offering a refurbished model of the Nintendo Switch OLED at a massive discount. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6171/">Going refurbished over new, normally will save you about $40 ($360 versus $400). However, right now for Cyber Week, the price has come down to just $310</a>. You end up saving $75 wen compared to buying the Switch OLED new, and you can join the Nintendo ecosystem for $171 less than you’d pay buying a brand new Nintendo Switch 2.</p>
<p>While the Nintendo Switch debuted way back in 2017, Nintendo did release updated hardware between then and now with the Nintendo Switch OLED arriving in 2021. This mid-generation upgrade brought substantial improvements over the original version. The most notable change is the 7-inch OLED screen, which delivers brighter, more vivid visuals, especially noticeable in games with prevalent deep blacks like <em>Metroid Dread</em>—a title that launched alongside the OLED model.</p>

<h2>OLED vs. Switch 2</h2>
<p>Interestingly, the new Switch 2 doesn’t feature an OLED display. Instead, it uses an LCD screen with HDR, which represents an improvement over the standard LCD technology on the launch model Switch but still can’t match the color richness and depth of OLED. This decision seems to be a cost-saving measure by Nintendo, and they likely aim to release a Switch 2 with an OLED screen in the future. As it stands now, certain games actually look better on the OLED model compared to the Switch 2 due to the superior display.</p>
<p>When it comes to battery life, the Nintendo Switch OLED still holds an advantage. The Switch 2 offers between 2 to 6.5 hours of battery life depending on the intensity of the games you play. In contrast, the Switch OLED lasts anywhere between 4.5 to 9 hours, providing a more reliable portable gaming experience. Though the Switch 2 comes with a larger 5220mAh battery (compared to the Switch OLED’s 4310mAh), the bigger screen and higher resolution (1080p handheld) cause the Switch 2 to drain its battery more quickly than the OLED model.</p>



<h2>Game Library</h2>
<p>If you’re drawn to the new Nintendo Switch 2 because of its shiny new titles like <em>Donkey Kong: Bananza</em> and <em>Mario Kart World</em>, you’re in for some fun, but beyond those there’s a just a couple new releases that dropped in time for the holiday. All and all, the first-year lineup of games is still somewhat limited. You might find that there’s no immediate need to jump to the newest generation just yet, especially with the vast selection of games already available on the original Switch.</p>
<p>The Nintendo Switch has a well-established library, with fan-favorites like <em>Super Mario Odyssey</em> and <em>The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild</em> still being some of the best titles in gaming. Furthermore, the original Switch is packed with incredible indie games, such as <em>Celeste</em>, <em>Hollow Knight</em>, and<em> Hades</em>, which can each on their own keep your attention for hundreds of hours.</p>
<p>Ultimately, whether the Switch OLED or the Switch 2 is the right choice for you depends on your priorities. If you’re looking for an excellent value and don’t mind going with a model that’s a couple of years old, the Nintendo Switch OLED offers great performance, stunning handheld visuals, and longer battery life. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6171/">You can grab one now for just $310</a>. Then maybe we just hold out for Nintendo to eventually release a Nintendo Switch 2 OLED in a few years.</p>
