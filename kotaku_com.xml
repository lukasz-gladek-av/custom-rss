              <p>It’s easy to feel cramped up when you’re working or gaming on a single screen. An easier (and cheaper) solution than upgrading your entire setup is to add a second display, and bonus points if it’s portable. The 15.6-inch MNN portable monitor is an excellent option to consider for this, and right now, you don’t have to pay the full price for it.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3959/">It was already quite affordable at $90, but currently it sits at just $60 on Amazon after a 33% discount.</a> This discount is a limited-time one, so act fast to grab it while the offer is still live.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3959/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Slim, Portable Build With Impressive Visuals</h2>
<p>You’re getting a 15.6-inch 1080p IPS panel, which is the same as many full-sized laptop screens. Resolution pushes to 1920×1080 for a sharp, vibrant display, regardless of what you’re using it for. Visuals are pretty much consistent from any angle, and the matte finish helps cut down on reflections, so using it in brighter settings won’t be a problem. And since these specs match what you’ll find on many built-in laptop screens, you really won’t feel a drastic difference when switching between your main display and this one.</p>
<p>There are also multiple display modes for different tasks. We’re talking Extended Mode for a larger screen space, Second Screen Mode for a dual-monitor setup, Portrait Mode to use it as a vertical display, and more. Maybe go with the extended option while playing a game, and the portrait mode when you’re reading something!</p>



<p>Connectivity options include two full-feature USB-C ports and a mini HDMI port, meaning you can connect it to your laptop, PC, smartphone, tablet, MacBook, gaming console, or even a Switch. Just note that your device needs to support USB-C DP Alt Mode or HDMI output. If it does, a single USB-C cable that comes included in the box should be enough to handle both power and video.</p>
<p>The monitor itself is quite lightweight and easy to carry around. You’re also getting a scratch-proof smart cover made of durable PU leather exterior. It not only protects the screen from everyday wear and tear, but also doubles as a stand that you can use to easily prop the monitor up.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3959/">Altogether, this is quite an affordable option to consider if you’ve been wanting to invest in a second screen that works with a range of devices</a>. It goes with you wherever you go, and there are no compromises on the visual quality.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/the-ecoflow-power-station-sells-out-every-hurricane-season-and-its-now-going-for-pennies-2000634598</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/the-ecoflow-power-station-sells-out-every-hurricane-season-and-it%E2%80%99s-now-going-for-pennies.1323541/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Power outages during hurricane season, winter storms knocking out electricity for days or those rolling blackouts during summer heatwaves – these aren’t rare anymore, they’re becoming the new normal. Having a reliable backup power source is now essential for keeping your family safe and comfortable when the grid goes down.</p>
<p>Amazon just dropped the <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4505/">price on the 1,800W EcoFlow Delta 2 from $699 to $429</a>, which makes it the lowest price we’ve ever tracked for this powerhouse portable power station that <strong>can run 90% of your household appliances</strong>. This is the unit that sells out every time severe weather hits and right now you can grab it at 39% off.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4505/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Best in Class Power Station</h2>
<p>The EcoFlow Delta 2 is equipped with a <strong>1024-watt-hour LiFePO4 battery that has 1800W of continuous AC power</strong> through four standard wall outlets. That 1800-watt power rating puts it in a whole different class compared to smaller power stations because it can power high-draw appliances such as space heaters, power tools, electric grills, and even clothes washers.</p>
<p>The unit achieves a <strong>surge capacity of up to 2700 watts to power the initial surge</strong> of power with motor-driven appliances turning on so that your refrigerator or air conditioner kicks on without a hiccup. LiFePO4 chemistry is capable of over <strong>3000 full charge cycles until the battery degrades to 80% capacity</strong>, which equates to about 10 years of day use. This is six times longer compared to conventional lithium-ion batteries used within lower-cost power stations.</p>



<p>The charging speed on this device is completely nuts: The <strong>Delta 2 reaches 80% from zero in 50 minutes</strong> and 100% in 80 minutes with a standard wall outlet. That’s seven times as fast as previous EcoFlow products and enables you to get disaster backup power virtually instantly when storms are looming. The product feeds 1200 watts of AC input to the battery and that’s why it charges that quickly. The fans do run noisier during this fast charging mode and reaches approximately 58 decibels, but the charging speed can be lowered with the EcoFlow app to minimize noise if you are charging overnight.</p>
<p>The front panel is flush<strong> with 15 assorted outlets</strong>: You’ve got four AC outlets that together carry a rating of 1800 watts, two USB-C ports each carrying 100 watts of power (capable of fast-charging two MacBook Pros simultaneously), four USB-A with assorted speeds including two capable of 18-watt fast charging, one 12-volt auto outlet ideal for items such as portable coolers, and one DC5521 output port.</p>



<p>The LCD display shows real-time power input and output in watts, remaining battery percentage and estimated runtime based on your current load. This makes it easy to see exactly how much juice you have left and plan accordingly. The <em>EcoFlow</em> app adds remote control functionality and allows you to monitor power usage from anywhere, adjust charging speeds, and control connected outlets even when you’re not near the unit. The app also provides detailed energy consumption statistics so you can see which devices are draining the battery fastest.</p>
<p>The <strong>unit weighs 27 pounds</strong> which is heavier than the smaller capacity power stations yet light enough to be lifted with one hand with the heavy-duty built-in handle. The compact unit doesn’t occupy much floor space, and the top is level to easily stack items on top of it or store it away under a desk. The power station functions in extreme temperatures as well as features advanced battery management with 62 different protective features that <strong>watch temperature, voltage, current, and other vitals to ensure that everything stays within the safety range</strong>.</p>
<p>At $429 instead of $699, this is a 39% off deal and the lowest price that this power station has ever reached on Amazon. As with these units, they always seem to run out of stock during natural disasters when everyone wakes up as one to the sudden realization that they could use some backup power, so don’t delay waiting until the next hurricane watch to come to a decision.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/this-ryzen-5-lenovo-copilot-gaming-laptop-just-took-more-than-1000-haircut-at-amazon-feels-practically-free-now-2000634493</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/this-ryzen-5-lenovo-copilot-gaming-laptop-just-took-more-than-1-000-haircut-at-amazon-feels-practically-free-now.1323502/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Gamers and deal hunters usually don’t fish in the same ponds. Deal hunters are often willing to cut a few corners and give up a few features in the name of the almighty wallet. But to a gamer, sacrificing features like a fast processor and quick, reactive screen mean certain elimination in a battle royal game or enough lag-induced annoyance that those extra few hundred bucks are almost always worth shelling out.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4489/">But when a gaming laptop like this 15-inch beauty from Lenovo takes a sharp and completely unexpected $1,000 price dive at Amazon and is transformed from a $1,700 investment into an incredible $650 deal</a>, the gamers and deal hunters will be racing to be the first to click buy. And while Amazon’s supply of these hot gaming laptops is almost certainly ample, the amount of time left on the deal might not be — it’s always hard to tell just how “limited” a limited-time Amazon deal is.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4489/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>The Specs Check Out</h2>
<p>We know the deal hunters were already satisfied when they saw that 62% discount label on this Lenovo, but the gamers are all about the specs. Good news — they check out, starting with the six-core, 12-thread AMD Ryzen 5 7535HS processor with a base speed of 3.3GHz and boost speed up to 4.55GHz. Add in the 40GB of DDR5 RAM and large-scale 1TB PCIe SSD, and while it may not be able to go toe to toe with those $3,000-plus pro rigs, the Lenovo massively overperforms on that new $650 Amazon price.</p>
<p>The screen also passes muster — it’s a 15.3-inch WUXGA (1920×1200) IPS panel with a slightly taller aspect ratio than the standard 16:9 for a little extra visual real estate. The 300 nits of brightness combined with anti-glare coating mean you don’t have to dim all the lights and draw the blackout shades to get a good picture. The Radeon 660M integrated GPU is perfect for eSports, mid-level FPS and battle royal games, and most definitely for streaming and creative work.</p>



<h2>Lagless Internet</h2>
<p>Wi-Fi 6 is an absolute must for any gaming laptop, and the Lenovo delivers, along with Bluetooth 5.3 for controllers. There’s DisplayPort support too, along with other ports including two USB-A, one HDMI 1.4, and an SD card reader. It’s preloaded with Windows 11 Pro and Microsoft Copilot, so even when it’s not in gaming mode it’s a more than ample everyday laptop.</p>
<p>While the gaming shoppers almost never look at anything below four figures, and deal hunters won’t normally seek anything with that comma in the price, everyone’s wants, needs, and interests are satisfied by the 62% off limited-time Amazon deal on this 15.3-inch Lenovo gaming laptop. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4489/">It’s just $650 if you’re quick enough to catch it before it’s gone.</a></p>

              <p>The mascot for late-stage capitalism is <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kcfav-5kArM">that final orgy scene in horror classic <em>Society</em></a>. (Do not click on that YouTube link in any circumstances, ever.) Everything consuming everything else until all that’s left is one monstrous behemoth of hideous depravity. So, moments after Paramount was allowed to merge with Skydance for just one $16 million bribe and <a href="https://kotaku.com/jimmy-kimmel-fallon-colbert-stewart-trump-kirk-2000627249">the head of Stephen Colbert</a>, the resulting mutilation is trying to come for Warner Bros. Discovery. However, <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-10-12/warner-bros-is-said-to-rebuff-paramount-takeover-approach">according to&nbsp;<em>Bloomberg</em></a>&nbsp; its first attempt has been rebuffed for being too low of a bid.</p> <p>Among a great deal else, Warner Bros. owns all of DC, including its movies, TV shows and comics, and the many video game spin-offs including the&nbsp;<em>Arkham</em> Batman games. Then it has everything&nbsp;<em>Harry Potter</em> and&nbsp;<em>Hogwarts</em>, as well as all of the enormously popular&nbsp;<em>Lego</em> games. Which is to say, along with being a massive movie studio and streamer (it also owns HBO), it’s a very significant player in the world of video games.</p>

 <p>Word began spreading that Paramount was circling the movie, TV and video game studio a while back, with&nbsp;<a href="https://deadline.com/2025/10/david-zaslav-warner-bros-purchase-paramount-david-ellison-1236575377/"><em>Deadline</em> reporting last week</a> that the plan was to swoop in and pick up the entire media corporation before current Warner boss David Zaslav splits the company in half. Motivated by the Trump-controlled FCC’s allowance of the merger with Skydance, Paramount seems to believe it can bypass concerns of monopolies once more and take over Bugs Bunny’s business in just six months. But it seems the first approach hasn’t been good enough for Zaslav.</p>

 <p>According to <em>Bloomberg</em>, an offer of $20 per share was made in recent weeks, which Warner didn’t consider high enough.&nbsp;<em>Deadline</em>‘s reporting says that Zaslav is looking for $30 a share, while claiming it had heard Paramount boss David Ellison was offering $22-$24. If&nbsp;<em>Bloomberg</em> is correct, it seems the money people came in even lower, testing how desperate Zaslav is to sell. And, if you’re interested, the shares are currently valued at $17.10, making Warner Bros. Discovery worth $42.3 billion, but also carrying a ton of debt. Apparently Paramount’s $17 shares make <em>it&nbsp;</em>worth only $18.6 billion. How can one buy the other, you ask? Because money isn’t real, and big businesses can fudge any old shite they want.</p>

 <p>It seems Zaslav really wants to split the company, separating it into a (surely doomed) cable TV company (that you just have to imagine will magically take on so much of the debt), and a streaming and studios company. So, I guess, when the former fails the debt goes away? Is that how it works? It seems too horribly likely that that’s how it works. Then, without the old-world cable TV anvil strapped around its neck, it’d make the remaining company a lot more likely to be more highly valued in a buy-out.</p> <p>Presumably Paramount won’t give up, with future approaches likely to include upping its offer or going directly to shareholders—this is very likely just a first, exploratory poke of the ant nest. And soon, everything will be owned by one giant corporation to which we will forcibly pledge our allegiance and worship every Sunday morning.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Crucial’s X10 4TB Portable SSD Returns to Its Prime Day Low After a Brief Price Hike, Only $0.05 per GB]]></title>
            <link>https://kotaku.com/crucials-x10-4tb-portable-ssd-returns-to-its-prime-day-low-after-a-brief-price-hike-only-0-05-per-gb-2000634496</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/crucial%E2%80%99s-x10-4tb-portable-ssd-returns-to-its-prime-day-low-after-a-brief-price-hike-only-0-05-per-gb.1323433/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>It’s rare that a tech deal approaches perfection as closely as this one that’s just popped up at Amazon. That might sound hyperbolic, <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4275/">but how else would you describe this all-time low price on the Crucial X10 4TB SSD,</a> which is one of the most complete portable drives in terms of physical size (tiny and lightweight), memory (huge), and speed (blazing)?</p>
<p>Amazon’s dropped the price on this all-star portable hard drive by 39% to an unprecedented $240. The Crucial X10’s appeal is multiplied when you take into account that it’s compatible with Windows, Mac, Android, iPad, Linux, and gaming consoles. Need more? It’s also IP65 dust and water resistant, and probably most importantly of all considering it’s modest size, the Crucial X10 is also drop-resistant up to nearly 10 feet.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4275/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Something for Everyone</h2>
<p>When a portable SSD has nearly universal compatibility to go along with all of its many outstanding features, it also gains nearly universal appeal. Creative professionals like photo and video shooters and editors love the massive 4TB capacity, but they might love the truly outstanding 2,100MB/s read and 2,000MB/s write speeds that blast through even the biggest files in no time flat. The size and speed also make it a perfect source of extra storage for gaming consoles, and anyone just looking for a big, fast, reliable drive that will keep everything backed up and won’t take over their desk space will be thrilled by the Crucial X10.</p>
<p>Who else is this drive designed for? Students, for sure, since it’s big enough to keep all of those important files backed up and safe while also taking up next to no backpack space. Families with thousands of irreplaceable digital photos and home videos can fit all of them in the generous 4TB capacity of the Crucial X10 to keep them safe. The better question is, who isn’t the Crucial X10 designed for?</p>



<h2>Deal Become Steal</h2>
<p>While you’re more than welcome to keep the Crucial X10 on your desk fulltime, or keep it in a drawer to pull out for regular backups, it’s practically begging to be taken on the go. It’s <em>really</em> small — 2.55 inches wide by 1.96 long by 0.39 thick, and a truly ridiculous 1.13&nbsp;<em>ounces</em> — not pounds. It’s literally pocket-sized, or an ideal addition to a camera bag.</p>
<p>The 4TB version of the Crucial X10 portable drive — it’s also available in 1TB, 2TB, 6TB, and 8TB versions — normally sells for $396, and to be honest, that’s a very fair price for a compact, fast, reliable portable hard drive that’s also tough enough to take a good-sized drop. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4275/">This 39% off deal at Amazon is the biggest one ever for this highly rated drive, bringing it to an all-time low price of just $240.</a></p>
