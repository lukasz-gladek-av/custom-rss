              <p>There are many, many, <em>many</em> retro-themed first-person shooters, aka <a href="https://kotaku.com/cruel-boomer-shooter-retro-fps-pc-steam-2025-review-1851737479">boomer shooters</a>, on the market. Some might say there are too many. I’m inclined to agree with that, if only because there’s a lot of crap and slop out there pretending to be solid throwbacks to fast-paced FPS action. <em>MeowGun: Hell Denizen, </em>out now on Steam, isn’t one of those disappointing games.</p> <p><em>MeowGun’</em>s biggest strength is that, like some other <a href="https://kotaku.com/dark-souls-morrowind-doom-engine-mohtra-review-pc-steam-fps-boomer-shooter-2000647667">great retro shooters</a> <a href="https://kotaku.com/wrath-is-a-retro-shooter-done-right-1841067258">including <em>Wrath</em></a>, it is built using an open-source version of a classic FPS engine. In this case, <em>MeowGun</em> uses FTEQW, which is an excellent open-source version of the original <em>Quake</em> engine. And as is usually the case with these boomer shooters built on the tech of the past, it helps make <em>MeowGun</em> feel fantastic.</p>

  <p>Every gun in <em>MeowGun</em> is snappy, loud, and deadly. You move fast, but always feel in control. And blowing away demons with pistols, shotguns, bombs, and grenade launchers is a joy. It helps that <em>MeowGun’s</em> developers understand that people play boomer shooters to blow shit up and kill lots of enemies while sprinting through various levels that should never be too big. I also appreciate that <em>MeowGun’s</em> starting pistol is quite powerful and proves useful in fights for picking off enemies or saving ammo. This ain’t a peashooter you’ll never use after you get a new weapon.</p> <p><em>MeowGun’s</em> voice acting is at times distracting, especially as the main character–a half cat/half demon woman named MeowMeow–speaks almost entirely in movie quotes and pop culture references. And they start to repeat pretty quickly. Thankfully, I was often blowing up so much shit that I rarely could hear these lines. But if a talking protagonist is too much for you, <em>MeowGun</em> might be a grating experience. On the other hand, if you love cats, there are small and very adorable kittens to find and save. Yes, before you ask, you can pet the cats you save. Oh, and there’s a dedicated button to make your character meow. I’ll let you decide how that makes you feel.</p>

 <p>To be clear: <em>MeowGun: Hell Denizen</em> isn’t some revolutionary first-person shooter that I’m going to come back to year after year to enjoy. But it is a damn good retro FPS that understands what people want out of these kinds of games: Lots of enemies to kill, fast music, satisfying guns, and short load times. And <em>MeowGun</em> delivers on all of that and costs less than $15. In 2026, I can’t ask for much more.</p>

              <p><span>Google has just started rolling out access to its new “experimental research prototype” Project Genie, an AI tool powered by Genie 3 and Gemini that allows users to create interactive, explorable worlds with a simple text prompt. Unsurprisingly, someone has immediately used it to generate a bunch of playable Nintendo knock-offs, including a </span><i><span>The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild </span></i><span>clone, complete with a usable paraglider. I’m sure that the famously non-litigious Nintendo will be absolutely chill about this.</span></p> <p><span>This news comes by way of </span><a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/869726/google-ai-project-genie-3-world-model-hands-on?view_token=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiJ9.eyJpZCI6ImZCakl0bmxFNGwiLCJwIjoiL25ld3MvODY5NzI2L2dvb2dsZS1haS1wcm9qZWN0LWdlbmllLTMtd29ybGQtbW9kZWwtaGFuZHMtb24iLCJleHAiOjE3NzAxNDAwNTYsImlhdCI6MTc2OTcwODA1OH0.q5OBTD_V36-65oc1EGqPxKYCZF00c7ODvifvagVcwbA&amp;utm_medium=gift-link"><i><span>The Verge’s</span></i></a><span> Jay Peters, who was granted access to Google’s Project Genie tool early, ahead of its official release for Google AI Ultra subscribers in the United States earlier this afternoon. Peters was able to craft playable reproductions of several famous Nintendo titles, including </span><i><span>Super Mario 64</span></i><span> and the aforementioned </span><i><span>The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild</span></i><span>, as well as generating some odd amalgamation of </span><i><span>Metroid Prime 3</span></i><span> and </span><i><span>Metroid Prime 4</span></i><span>.</span></p>    <p><span>While it might not be immediately apparent in the videos that Peters provided, these Project Genie AI-generations are partially interactive, allowing users to move, jump, and, in the case of that </span><i><span>Breath of the Wild</span></i><span> one, even paraglide. For the time being, the worlds that it generates are limited to minute-long, 24fps, 720p showcases.</span></p>

 <p><span>So, how is this legal? The short answer is that it isn’t, and Project Genie knows it isn’t.</span></p> <p><span>At one point during his testing, Project Genie stopped Peters from making any further </span><i><span>Super Mario 64</span></i><span> reproductions, out of concern for the “interests of third-party content providers.”</span></p> <p><span>He also came dangerously close to generating a playable version of </span><i><span>Kingdom Hearts</span></i><span>. Project Genie generated an AI-generated mock-up featuring Donald Duck, Sora, Cloud, and Jack Skellington before the process was cut off at the world generation stage. I would have absolutely loved to have seen the resulting AI platform vs. AI platform legal battle that may have spawned out of that, considering </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/disney-open-ai-sora-deal-star-wars-frozen-2000652583"><span>Disney signed a $1 billion deal</span></a><span> to license its characters to OpenAI’s genAI platform.</span></p>
