As such, Paramount has done another marketing push for the movie by releasing concept art of some of the film’s most pivotal moments. The images include what seem to be previous iterations of the movie’s post-credits scene, which was exciting, but a bit confusing. While the moment depicted in the art doesn’t appear in the final film, it still may nevertheless clear up one thing about the <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/sonic-hedgehog-3-4-post-credits-amy-rose-metal-shadow-1851726285&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/sonic-hedgehog-3-4-post-credits-amy-rose-metal-shadow-1851726285">post-credits scene</a></span> fans have been wondering about since the movie premiered in December. Let’s get into what it might mean for the future of the live-action <em>Sonic </em>universe.

Most of the moments shown in these (gorgeous) pieces made their way into the final film, such as Sonic and Shadow fighting as their super forms in space, Ivo and Gerald Robotnik duking it out inside the Eclipse Cannon, and Sonic’s family roasting marshmallows before G.U.N. comes to ask for their help stopping Shadow. But a few of them show scenes that were either cut from the film, or heavily altered for it. This includes two pieces that depict the characters introduced in the post-credits scene: <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/sonic-3-post-credits-amy-reverse-sonamy-relationship-1851730058&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/sonic-3-post-credits-amy-reverse-sonamy-relationship-1851730058">Amy Rose</a></span> and Metal Sonic.</p><figure id="" data-id="60f44164e54cb5e92651aa073183f57c" data-recommend-id="image://60f44164e54cb5e92651aa073183f57c" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1320" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Amy is shown standing on top of a destroyed robot as Sonic is laying down in front of it." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Amy is shown standing on top of a destroyed robot as Sonic is laying down in front of it." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Paramount</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="60f44164e54cb5e92651aa073183f57c" data-recommend-id="image://60f44164e54cb5e92651aa073183f57c" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1320" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Amy is shown standing on top of a destroyed robot as Sonic is laying down in front of it." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>The art of Amy closely resembles her introduction in the final movie. She’s shown wielding her hammer and taking down what looks like one of Eggman’s giant robots, seemingly saving Sonic from the threat. This is basically how she appears in the movie, except instead of taking down a giant, mostly non-descript robot, she saves Sonic from a squad of his metal doppelgangers. The art of Metal Sonic, however, is unlike anything seen in the final film. We see the robot standing guard next to Eggman, who is adorned in an extravagant red-and-gold robe and wielding a golden staff. In the background, we can see that the world behind him appears to have been desecrated, implying that Eggman and Metal Sonic have conquered it.</p><p>Notably, this image may clear up a question fans have had about Metal Sonic’s origins since <em>Sonic 3 </em>premiered. Metal Sonic does seem to have been created by Eggman, but perhaps not the one we’ve followed for three movies. Fans have been speculating that <em>Sonic the Hedgehog 4 </em>may take place in a far-flung future, and that Sonic may have broken the time barrier at the end of the third movie. Amy’s hooded vigilante outfit, seen in the post-credits scene, is evocative of a hero who is on the run from some kind of police-state-level force. There’s also the possibility that Sonic, rather than moving forward in time, may have instead shifted to an alternate timeline in which Eggman is still alive and perhaps didn’t have the change of heart shown at the end of <em>Sonic 3</em>. </p><figure id="" data-id="e42752224e2f6ae29ed0b6e110b11e95" data-recommend-id="image://e42752224e2f6ae29ed0b6e110b11e95" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1320" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Eggman stands next to Metal Sonic while wearing a long red-and-gold robe and holding a golden staff." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Eggman stands next to Metal Sonic while wearing a long red-and-gold robe and holding a golden staff." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Paramount</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="e42752224e2f6ae29ed0b6e110b11e95" data-recommend-id="image://e42752224e2f6ae29ed0b6e110b11e95" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1320" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Eggman stands next to Metal Sonic while wearing a long red-and-gold robe and holding a golden staff." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>It’s also possible this concept art tells us nothing about the movie that’s coming and is instead just a scrapped idea the team was toying with. But at the very least, this is the most concrete clue we’ve been given about Metal Sonic’s origins in the movies. It looks like he’s tied to Eggman in some way, even if the good doctor is supposedly gone. We’ll know more as we get closer to <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/sonic-4-sequel-confirmed-paramount-2027-sega-release-1851725410&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/sonic-4-sequel-confirmed-paramount-2027-sega-release-1851725410"><em>Sonic 4</em>’s release in 2027</a></span>, but for now, we have more to speculate on than that incredibly vague post-credits scene.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

The EA App is as clunky and frustrating as Origin ever was, a completely unnecessary obstacle between you and just double-clicking the icon for the game you want to play, but when you want to play <em>Burnout Paradise</em> for the 943rd time, it’s no more of an ordeal than it was before.</p><p>The real issues arrive if you’re running a 32-bit version of <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://help.ea.com/en/help/ea/ea-app/update-operating-system-for-ea-app/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://help.ea.com/en/help/ea/ea-app/update-operating-system-for-ea-app/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Windows</a></span> or <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://help.ea.com/en-gb/help/ea/ea-app/update-mac-operating-system-for-ea-app/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://help.ea.com/en-gb/help/ea/ea-app/update-mac-operating-system-for-ea-app/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Mac</a></span>.</p><p>The number of people who will be affected will admittedly be small, but a small number of a very big number still means an awful lot of people will be scuppered. If you’re in this group, the games you already own on Origin—despite not changing in any way—will not be playable via the EA app, and given Origin’s going to absolutely stop working entirely in three months, if you don’t upgrade your machine, you’re not going to be able to play them at all.</p><p>If you’re on Windows 11, you’re good, as Microsoft never released a 32-bit version of that OS, but Windows 10 users prior to 2020 could still buy a 32-bit version of the software, and upgrading it is a real pain in the ass. It involves entirely formatting the hard disk on which Windows is installed, and reinstalling Windows in its 64-bit incarnation. (If you’re not sure which you have, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://support.microsoft.com/en-gb/windows/32-bit-and-64-bit-windows-frequently-asked-questions-c6ca9541-8dce-4d48-0415-94a3faa2e13d#:~:text=Upgrading%20from%20the%2032%2Dbit,you%20had%20on%20your%20device.&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-gb/windows/32-bit-and-64-bit-windows-frequently-asked-questions-c6ca9541-8dce-4d48-0415-94a3faa2e13d#:~:text=Upgrading%20from%20the%2032%2Dbit,you%20had%20on%20your%20device." target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">this link will help</a></span>.) And that means you’ll need a CPU which can do that. Fortunately, you almost definitely do (follow that previous link and look for “System type” in the Settings window it pops open, and you should hopefully see “64-bit operating system, x64-based processor”).</p><p>If you don’t, however, your PC is probably extremely elderly, and to carry on playing your EA games, you’ll need to completely upgrade the whole thing. Or more realistically, replace it. So yeah, if you’re still running a decrepit old PC because that’s what you can afford right now, you will no longer be able to play the EA games you thought you owned.</p><p>That sucks.</p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
