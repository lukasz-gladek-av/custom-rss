              <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/gta-6-online-trailer-players-growth-release-date-2000616669">Take-Two CEO Strauss Zelnick</a> feels very confident that <em><a href="https://kotaku.com/grand-theft-auto-6-gta-vi-new-trailer-gameplay-story-1851779368">Grand Theft Auto 6</a></em> will launch on schedule in May 2026. Of course, this isn’t the first time he’s said he’s confident in the game releasing on time.</p> <p>On Monday, <a href="https://youtu.be/XC5BVh0IaOg?t=269">in a new interview with <em>CNBC</em></a>, as spotted by <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/gta-6-boss-talks-possibility-of-another-delay-and-teases-multiple-other-rockstar-games/1100-6533875/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f"><em>GameSpot</em></a>, the head of Rockstar Games’ parent company was asked about<em> Grand Theft Auto 6</em>, the hype around the game, and, of course, whether it will launch on time. Specifically, the host asked Zelnick what his “level of conviction” was that <em>GTA 6</em> would launch on May 26, 2026. Zelnick replied that his “level of conviction is very, very high, obviously.” The host then asked about high expectations for the game and how Rockstar and Take-Two are dealing with that.</p> <p>“We try not to pump expectations, right?” said Zelnick. “I think Rockstar’s whole stock and trade is to have these extraordinary expectations and still to beat them. I know that’s their goal. I know it’s going to be an amazing game. The rest we’ll see in the fullness of time.”</p> <p><iframe loading="lazy" title="Take-Two Interactive CEO on Q2 earnings, gamer growth and GTA 6" width="500" height="281" src="about:blank" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen="" data-rocket-lazyload="fitvidscompatible" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/XC5BVh0IaOg?start=269&amp;feature=oembed"></iframe></p> <p>Some online took this as gospel that <em>GTA 6</em> won’t be delayed again. But the reality is that while Zelnick is aware of the game’s development status, what he says publicly is never going to be a completely transparent answer. He also isn’t a game developer, and making games is hard. Landing a release date is challenging, even when not working on a massive game like <em>GTA 6</em>. And Zelnick has been wrong before.</p>

 <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/gta-6-release-date-delay-borderlands-4-fall-2025-1851757501">In February</a>, he told <em>IGN</em> that while there’s always a “risk” of a game being delayed, he still felt “really good about” it launching as planned in 2025. Less than two months later, <a href="https://kotaku.com/gta6-grand-theft-auto-6-release-date-delay-may-2026-1851778799"><em>Grand Theft Auto 6</em> was delayed until May 2026</a>.</p> <p>I don’t think Zelnick is lying or trying to deceive. But as the head of a large, publicly traded company, he has to exude confidence about the future. Everything is going great, until it’s not. Personally, I’m convinced<em> GTA 6</em> won’t be delayed again. But I also have no idea. The only people who really might have that information are the folks working on <em>GTA 6</em> right now, and even they probably can’t be sure whether it will or won’t nail its date. Games are messy things to create and often come together at the very end. So don’t put much stock into what the suit-wearing number cruncher at the top thinks will happen.</p> <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/gta-6-trailer-2-everything-spotted-round-up-easter-eggs-1851779329"><em>Grand Theft Auto 6</em>, set in sunny Vice City</a>, will (probably) launch on May 26, 2026 on Xbox Series X/S, PS5, and PC.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              
              <p><span>Most of us probably moved on from dial-up decades ago, but AOL, or as most people who grew up in the ‘90s and early aughts might remember it, America Online, is </span><a href="https://help.aol.com/articles/dial-up-internet-to-be-discontinued"><span>only just now in 2025 fully discontinuing the service</span></a><span>. For the young’uns among us, dial-up is a wired internet connection that monopolizes your phone line–this dates back to when most people’s primary telephone service was over landline–in exchange for pretty slow internet speeds by today’s standards. Nowadays most people use broadband internet, so dial-up has become less and less common, but somehow, AOL has kept its service going for decades. It’s finally officially shutting down on September 30.</span></p> <p><span>For most people, this is a moment of “oh, I didn’t realize people were still using dial-up,” but according to the </span><a href="https://data.census.gov/table/ACSDT1Y2023.B28011?q=B28011"><span>Census Bureau</span></a><span>, an estimated 163,401 households were operating on dial-up as of 2023. I wouldn’t be surprised if most of those homes are older people who only use the internet for things like email and the occasional Google search.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>Whatever the case, if you were alive and alert in the ‘90s, you were likely very aware of AOL and its internet services. And even if you </span><i><span>weren’t </span></i><span>alive then, you’ve probably heard the “</span><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjnyY85-gp0"><span>You’ve got mail</span></a><span>’ sound effect AOL played out of your speakers when you got a new email. Good lord, imagining that clip playing with the frequency at which the average 2025 inbox receives email sounds miserable. I suppose it’s just an example of how far the internet has come since AOL’s heyday.</span></p>

 <p><span>My family couldn’t afford dial-up until I was near the end of elementary school, so a lot of my early dial-up memories are of getting online at a family friend’s house or my uncle’s place to print out pictures of Shadow the Hedgehog for my school binder and watch music videos that took so long to buffer they looked like slideshows. A lot of people who are a bit older than me probably have memories of playing online games on dial-up, but its unreliability is also part of why </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/15-years-later-heres-why-a-gamer-was-duct-taped-to-a-c-1796679499"><span>in-person LAN parties</span></a><span> were so prominent back then. Nowadays, the internet has gotten good enough that we create virtual facsimiles of what used to be our workarounds for poor internet. Discord calls and online lobbies are another part of the average gamer’s life, so somehow we’ve come full circle. But while the internet has long since outpaced dial-up’s capabilities, it’s hard to overstate just how prominent AOL and its services were.</span></p> <p><span>AOL’s folksy “You’ve got mail” voice clip, </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/a-nostalgic-game-that-spills-out-into-your-internet-bro-1795666514"><span>its Instant Messenger app</span></a><span>, and the sound of a modem screaming to establish a dial-up connection are nearly as synonymous with ‘90s nostalgia as boy bands, the original 151 Pokemon, and the Internet Explorer logo. AOL’s dial-up, and the assortment of chatrooms and services it offered, were so embedded in the public image of the internet that our cultural perception of it as a kind of ISP/online hub has outlasted its actual providing of internet service.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>Once it seemed poised to take over the world, buying Time Warner in 2001 in what was then the largest corporate merger in history. But those days are long gone. Did you know AOL merged with news website and search engine </span><i><span>Yahoo! </span></i><span>in 2015, and is now </span><a href="https://www.aol.com/"><span>mostly an aggregate site</span></a><span>? It’s a bit sad that something that was once so unifying as a cultural artifact is now unrecognizable. AOL’s shift is the result of decades of changing hands, </span><a href="https://www.cnn.com/2021/05/03/media/verizon-yahoo-sold-apollo/index.html"><span>private equity fuckery</span></a><span>, and massive changes in the market. It turns out even the biggest businesses can crater. If you live long enough, you, too, can outlive corporate gods as they topple into the abyss.</span></p>
