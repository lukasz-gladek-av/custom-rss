              <p>Often considered to be the rarest <em>Pokémon</em> card of all, the so-called Pikachu Illustrator (it’s proper name is “Pokémon Illustrator” but no one calls it that) was a print of around 41 cards given to winners of a Japanese competition in 1998. It has since gone on to become notorious, not just for being so highly valued and sought after, but for being the card <a href="https://kotaku.com/logan-pauls-latest-stunt-paying-6-million-for-rare-pi-1848743633">on which one Logan Paul spent $5,300,000 in 2022</a>. Another of the cards, this one graded as a PSA 9, has just <a href="https://www.ebay.com/itm/362931142416">sold for a flat $4,000,000 on eBay</a>, reaffirming it as the most valuable <em>Pokémon</em> card of all.</p> <p>In 1998, when the <em>Pokémon TCG</em> was in its infancy, the prize of a unique Pikachu card for the CoroCoro Comic Illustration Contest must have been nice enough, but not all&nbsp;<em>that</em> special. It’s not known exactly how many were handed out, but it’s believed 41 were printed, made unique by having the word “ILLUSTRATOR” where “TRAINER” would usually appear. The holographic image shows Pikachu clutching an enormous paintbrush, while the Japanese text underneath congratulates the recipients as having been “recognized as excellent in the Pokémon Card Game Illustration Contest.” It’s not known how many survive, but of those that do, the condition they’re in becomes everything. The card Logan Paul bought for $5,275,000 was graded as a PSA 10, meaning it is in absolutely perfect condition. Meanwhile, <a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-card-illustrator-pikachu-charizard-ebay-auction-1850200024">a PSA 7 version in 2023 put up for bids starting at $480,000</a> received not a single offer and went unsold.</p> <p>On Friday September 12, however, another colossal sale price got added to the roster. (Thanks, <a href="https://www.dexerto.com/gaming/pikachu-illustrator-pokemon-card-sells-for-4-million-on-ebay-3250904/"><em>Dexerto</em></a>.) A PSA 9 version of the Pikachu Illustrator <a href="https://www.ebay.com/itm/362931142416?_skw=pikachu+illustrator+psa+9&amp;itmmeta=01K52B559AYKACEQJRAQ7FYPBQ&amp;hash=item548061bf10:g:ZMkAAOSw2gBftsUY&amp;itmprp=enc%3AAQAKAAAA4FkggFvd1GGDu0w3yXCmi1cD8%2B4RNIGPjfQu10cI3i7MiADIleeZmkMYbcHoGskKVW1uFRrdDQysRGobsccSxuxXNvblhU%2FDuNa8rtRuryQ4jRrEqmuDdthKCzWAkeGrOHT15w6WQt0QPM0uUbamjZPwSrbdviamyB6ZO3%2BEbbja5BqX80KH0oj4pd%2Fx8deTTy%2BeUD96JJSDtNmqyAEbZLX4p68cWqQwaFo98rDfp%2BlTV7vJOAIRPgSvcbxGaGuWwPR9WHUFXjtiqjIPLTu%2FxucxvKlojILs3rcAnLeH4Jb1%7Ctkp%3ABk9SR_jUlMuoZg">went up for auction on eBay from seller Scott “smpratte” Pratte, and sold for a cool $4,000,000</a>. This specific card, described as “the Holy Grail of Pokémon,” was for a long time thought to be the only PSA 9 to exist, submitted by Pratte himself after he added it to his collection in 2011. <a href="https://www.psacard.com/articles/articleview/9249/collector-profile-scott-pratte-profiling-premier-pokemon-trading-card-prognosticator">According to PSA</a>, in 2017 there were four examples graded 9, and at some point Pratte had owned all four of them. In 2013 he sold another PSA 9 version of the Pikachu, listing it for $100,000, but eventually accepting an offer for $50,000. That’s 1.25 percent of what he got for another Pikachu Illustrator with the game grading this weekend. <a href="https://comics.ha.com/itm/memorabilia/trading-cards/pokemon-pikachu-illustrator-trainer-promo-hologram-trading-card-1998-psa-9-mint/a/7141-91305.s?type=DA-DMC-PriceCharting">He sold another in 2016 for just $55,000</a>, which at the time was considered to be&nbsp;<em>extraordinarily</em> high.</p>

 <p><em>Pokémon </em>card prices started to grow in 2020, as the covid lockdowns seemed to drive people to their lofts to find old binders, with classic cards becoming incredibly desirable. This peaked in 2022 when Logan Paul bought the PSA 10 Illustrator as a stunt, and then wore it around his neck on a chain during one of his fake-ass boxing fights. That remains the most expensive card ever, but this weekend’s sale suggests the impact of that price is lasting. Not least considering a PSA 9 Pikachu Illustrator <a href="https://comics.ha.com/itm/memorabilia/trading-cards/pokemon-pikachu-illustrator-unnumbered-promo-corocoro-comics-psa-trading-card-game-9-the-pokemon-company-1998-/a/7287-36167.s?type=DA-DMC-PriceCharting">sold the same year for $840,000</a>.</p> <p>It’s not clear why Pratte has chosen to part with it now, although I can think of four million really good reasons. It’s really hard to imagine this value sustaining, so there’s a decent chance it’s been sold at its peak. It’s notable that <a href="https://comics.ha.com/itm/memorabilia/trading-cards/pokemon-pikachu-illustrator-unnumbered-promo-corocoro-comics-psa-trading-card-game-mint-9-the-pokemon-company-1998-/a/7442-36073.s?ic4=GalleryView-ShortDescription-071515">someone else sold an identical card just last month for only $625,000</a>, the only difference being that Pratte’s was the first to be graded at 9. You’d imagine whoever sold it must be <em>furious&nbsp;</em>right now, but I can’t help but notice the listing uses the same “Holy Grail!” language as Pratte’s eBay listing. Look, eventually <em>someone’s</em> going to notice that it’s a piece of cardboard. Also, PSA now lists 15 of the card graded PSA 9, 12 as PSA 8, and 7 as PSA 7.</p>

              <p>You can make streaming all your favorite movies and shows a seamless experience with the help of a Fire TV. Specifically, the Fire TV Cube which is the most feature-packed streaming device in Amazon’s lineup. Right now, Amazon, has it marked down by a solid 29%. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4111/">Normally, you’d find the Fire TV Cube going for $140, but after the discount, it comes down to just $100</a>. That’ll save you a whole $40 for a limited time.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4111/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>The Ultimate Streaming Experience</h2>
<p>Okay, I know what your thinking. Why the cube? What’s better about the cube than the stick? Well, the Fire TV Cube has a built-in mic and speaker. It’s sort of a Fire TV Stick and an Echo Dot all in one. With the Fire TV Cube, you can use Alexa hands-free. The Fire TV Stick’s Alexa support is baked into the remote. You need to hold down a button and speak in for it to register what you’re asking. But what if you’re all cozied up under a blanket and the remote is all the way <em>over there</em>? Now you see the value.</p>
<p>The Fire TV Cube also uses an octa-core processor which can provide about twice the power of the Fire TV Stick 4K Max—the premium option for Fire TV Sticks. It leads to better performance from your apps like speedier start-up times and faster streaming. And with Wi-Fi 6E support, the upper limit of streaming speeds is pretty dang good.</p>



<p>With any Fire TV, you get to download a wide range of streaming apps so you can keep up with all your favorite content. Get Netflix, Disney+, HBO Max (I think that’s what it’s called again last I checked), and Prime Video, of course. Enjoy watching your movies and shows with impressive picture and sound quality thanks to support for cinematic 4K, Dolby Vision, HDR, and Dolby Atmos audio.</p>
<p>You can connect all your entertainment sources through your Fire TV Cube, allowing you to switch between them. Just use Alexa to ask to pull up your Xbox when you’re ready to try again against Sister Splinter in&nbsp;<em>Hollow Knight: Silksong.&nbsp;</em>Then when you give up after 20 more tries, you can ask to switch back over to your cable box in time to catch a rerun of the latest episode of<em> Bob’s Burgers</em>.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4111/">Drop the Stick and go for the Cube. Right now, you can save a good $40 on Amazon’s Fire TV Cube. You’ll only be paying an even $100 for a limited time.</a></p>
