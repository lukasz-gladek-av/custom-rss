            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Buried in the <a href="https://kotaku.com/marathon-release-date-trailer-leak-bungie-2000660975"><em>Marathon</em> launch info dump today</a>, which Bungie rushed out early after it was accidentally leaked over on Xbox, is the news that sci-fi shooter will arrive alongside the latest limited edition PlayStation 5 DualSense controller. And unlike many of the recent ones we’ve gotten, this one actually looks really good.</p> <p>The <em>Marathon</em>-inspired limited edition DualSense controller is $85 and goes up for pre-order on January 29 10:00 a.m. local time at direct.playstation.com. There’s also an accompanying Pulse Elite wireless headset that will go on sale at the same time, though for a much heftier price tag. That accessory will be $170. I’ve never loved the look of the Pulse headset and, frankly, the<em> Marathon</em> aesthetic isn’t changing that.</p>

 <figure id="attachment_2000660998" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000660998"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000660998">Sony</figcaption></figure> <p>What I love most about the <em>Marathon</em> DualSense, other than the generally subtle design and clean look, is how neatly the typography and icons mesh with the underlying sensibility of the controller. In other words, its a very natural fit unlike some other recent limited edition DualSenses. The <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/05/08/20250508-ds/"><em>Death Stranding 2</em> one</a> wasn’t bad but felt pretty bland and I didn’t dig the giant bronze block over the touch pad. The <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/07/10/first-look-ps5-ghost-of-yotei-limited-edition-console-designs/"><em>Ghost of Yotei</em> one</a>, meanwhile, looked like someone threw up gold dust on it.</p>

 <p>Bonus points to the <em>Marathon</em> controller for keeping the only branded text, the name of the game, hidden in neon on the underside of the controller. Is this controller even better looking than the <a href="https://www.ebay.com/itm/296678467989"><em>Concord</em> one</a>? I think so. Will it be as rare as that one? Probably! Hopefully, it’s not because<em> Marathon</em> ends up flopping as well.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Modder Blasts ‘Corpo Logic’ Over Cyberpunk 2077 VR Takedown]]></title>
            <link>https://kotaku.com/cyberpunk-2077-vr-mod-baldurs-gate-3-takedown-2000660987</link>
            <guid>1410133</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><span>The modder behind a paywalled </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/cyberpunk-2077-the-kotaku-review-1845946628"><i><span>Cyberpunk 2077</span></i></a><span> VR mod has accused CD Projekt RED of following “in Take-Two Interactive Software’s steps,” after its legal team issued their project with a DMCA takedown notice. Clearly undeterred, the same modder has even gone ahead and released a VR mod for </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/baldurs-gate-3-bg3-review-dungeons-dragons-rpg-larian-1850726491"><i><span>Baldur’s Gate 3</span></i></a><span>. It uses the same paywalled method of distribution that got them into trouble with <em>Cyberpunk 2077</em>.</span></p> <p><span>Luke Ross (not his real name, according to </span><a href="https://www.theverge.com/23190201/luke-ross-vr-real-mod-gta-v-elden-ring-horizon-red-dead"><i><span>The Verge</span></i></a><span>) is a somewhat infamous figure within the VR modding community. His “R.E.A.L. VR” project is a singular mod that supports dozens of high-profile video games, including </span><i><span>Elden Ring</span></i><span>, </span><i><span>Hogwarts Legacy</span></i><span> and </span><i><span>Marvel’s Spider-Man</span></i><span>.</span><span><br> </span><span><br> </span><span>The catch is that the R.E.A.L. VR mod requires a $10 monthly subscription to download directly through Luke Ross’ Patreon. While you could easily download everything you need with a one-off payment, you’d need to renew your subscription if one of the games is updated. If you’re curious as to how much Luke Ross is making off of said subscription, </span><i><span>The Verge</span></i><span> estimated that he was earning roughly $20,000 per month back in 2022.</span></p>

  <p><span>Requiring payment for a mod is obviously against most publishers’ terms of service, which is why Ross’ R.E.A.L. VR project has previously been subject to a <a href="https://kotaku.com/gta-v-take-two-mafia-modder-mods-luke-ross-vr-dmca-1849149715">DMCA takedown by Take-Two Interactive</a> for its </span><i><span>Red Dead Redemption II </span></i><span>and </span><i><span>Grand Theft Auto V</span></i><span> support.</span></p>

 <p><span>Based on a lengthy rant in the “About” section of his Patreon page in which he admonishes Take-Two for their “hostile behavior toward modders and gamers alike,” the VR modder doesn’t make much of a distinction between himself and those who release their mods for free.</span></p>

 <p><a href="https://www.patreon.com/posts/another-one-dust-148437771"><span>A new post</span></a><span> on his Patreon now projects that same ire at CD Projekt Red.&nbsp; It blasts the Polish RPG-maker for its “iron-clad corpo logic” over the fact that “</span><span>every little action that a company takes is in the name of money, but everything that modders do must be absolutely for free.” </span><span>“As usual they stretch the concept of ‘derivative work’ until it’s paper-thin, as though a system that allows visualizing 40+ games in fully immersive 3D VR was somehow built making use of their intellectual property,” Ross writes.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><span>This post went up on January 17. Since then, R.E.A.L. VR has been updated to include support for </span><i><span>Baldur’s Gate 3</span></i><span>. Hasbro, Wizards of the Coast’s parent company, has been quite liberal with its use of DMCA takedowns in the past, so I wouldn’t expect R.E.A.L. VR’s </span><i><span>Baldur’s Gate 3</span></i><span> support to stick around for long.</span></p>

 <h2>Turning <em>Cyberpunk 2077</em> VR into a modding live service</h2> <p><span>If I were to play devil’s advocate for a second, I do think there’s something to Luke Ross’ rants. R.E.A.L. VR is obviously not on the same level as your average mod, and likely requires a lot of upkeep. It’s hard to see a way in which he could continue to support it without some sort of monetary incentive.</span></p>

 <p><span>On the other hand, there’s a very straightforward loophole here that Ross is doubtlessly aware of and that hundreds of other modders take advantage of: donations. Instead of charging a one-off payment or a subscription for a mod, others release all of their mods for free and allow appreciative users to donate to them instead. There’s less danger with this method since donating is completely optional. </span></p> <p><span>Plenty of mod users don’t like mod paywalls either. A popular mod adding DLSS upscaling support to Starfield back at launch sparked its </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/starfield-dlss3-fsr2-pc-mod-nvidia-amd-intel-piracy-1850804328"><span>own controversy</span></a><span> when it was put behind a similar monthly subscription paywall. It seems the community is wise to Ross’ strategy, however, with many commenters over on the virtual reality subreddit taking CDPR’s side.</span><span><br> </span><span><br> </span><span>“This is not the first mod the Modder had taken down because he tried to make a Live Service out of it,” wrote user </span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/virtualreality/comments/1qfd6z2/comment/o03xc9q/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button"><span>Frraksurred</span></a><span>. “He knew he was outside the ToS and just chose to get away with it as long as he could. Now he’s trying to play the victim.” Others agreed. </span><span>“Good,” wrote user </span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/virtualreality/comments/1qfd6z2/comment/o04zlti/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button"><span>PelluxNetwork</span></a><span>. “Paywalled mods are disgusting. Take donations, no worries there, but pay-walling your copyright infringement should be an obvious no.” </span></p>

            <title><![CDATA[New Marathon Story Trailer Leaks Final Release Date Early]]></title>
            <link>https://kotaku.com/marathon-release-date-trailer-leak-bungie-2000660975</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Tau Ceti IV is sick and the only cure is stylish PvEvP extraction gunplay. That’s the vibe of a <a href="https://kotaku.com/marathon-runner-shells-trailer-abilities-bungie-2000660170">new <em>Marathon</em> trailer</a> that appears to have <a href="https://x.com/Mr_Rebs_/status/2013110010272682070">leaked on Xbox</a> ahead of schedule. While Sony plays whack-a-mole to get the new footage taken down, screenshots from it showing a March 5, 2026 release date have already spread across the internet.</p> <p><a href="https://streamable.com/ahh4d3">The new story trailer</a> includes a fresh sizzle reel of previously unseen gameplay showing off the sci-fi multiplayer shooter’s various maps, runners, and guns. There’s a healthy dose of the Bungie project’s exceptional art peppered throughout. But of most interest to casual players will be the nod to an early March launch date.</p>

  <p>Following its 2025 delay, the game only resurfaced with a vague March release window. This appears to confirm it’s coming at the early end of that range, giving Sony’s latest live-service game a few weeks to prove itself before the end of the fiscal year. According to <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/paultassi/2026/01/19/yes-the-leaked-marathon-preorder-and-release-date-is-real/">Paul Tassi at <em>Forbes</em></a>, the new trailer and final release date are accurate, with Bungie planning the official announcement to go live this week.</p>

 <p>There’s been some speculation among fans that Bungie will hold at least one round of open beta player tests before the game launches. If that’s the case, it now seems like a good bet we can expect those before the end of February. If so, it’ll be the last chance for people to go hands-on with the overhauled shooter for free before it arrives on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC <a href="https://kotaku.com/marathon-release-date-price-battle-pass-proximity-chat-2000653472">behind a $40 price point</a>.</p>

 <p><strong>Update: 1/29/2025, 11:04 a.m. ET:</strong> Bungie has gone ahead and released <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/marathonthegame.bungie.net/post/3mcrz6dqutv25">the official trailer</a> and confirmed the game’s expansive voice cast:</p> <blockquote><p>Krizia Bajos, Samantha Béart, Beau Bridgland, Ry Chase, Roger Clark, Darin De Paul, Jennifer English, Dave Fennoy, Nika Futterman, Morla Gorrondona, Reina Guthrie, Donnla Hughes, Keston John, Sohm Kapila, Rich Keeble, Elliot Knight, Erica Lindbeck, Piotr Michael, Brent Mukai, Neil Newbon, Ariana Nicole George, Emily O’Brien, Lee Shorten, Jason Spisak, Ben Starr, JB Tadena, Fred Tatasciore, Craig Lee Thomas, Elias Toufexis, Oliver Vaquer, Scott Whyte, Tracy Wiles, Erin Yvette</p></blockquote> <p>Pre-order pages are also up early for the standard, Deluxe, and Collector’s Edition pages.
