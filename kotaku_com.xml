            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Budget TVs traditionally meant accepting mediocre picture quality, sluggish interfaces and limited streaming options that frustrated users daily. Amazon’s <em>Insignia</em> Fire TV line solves these compromises by integrating their proven Fire TV platform directly into affordable displays that prioritize functionality over fancy features. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5898/">At $89, down from $149, this 40-inch model has hit a record-low price</a> on Amazon for Black Friday. The combination of <strong>1080p Full HD resolution, Alexa voice control, and access to virtually every major streaming service</strong> makes this one of the most practical secondary TVs available for bedrooms or kitchens.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5898/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<p>The <strong>integrated Fire TV interface ditches the clunky, outdated menus</strong> that plague generic budget TVs still running basic smart platforms from five years ago. Navigation feels responsive rather than laggy, with apps launching quick and content loading without frustrating delays that make you question your purchase. Access to over 1.5 million streaming movies and TV episodes spans all major services, including Prime Video, Netflix, Hulu, HBO Max, YouTube, Apple TV+, Disney+, ESPN+, and countless others, all without requiring external streaming devices.</p>



<p>The included <strong>Alexa Voice Remote transforms TV control from button-mashing frustration into natural voice commands</strong> that actually understand context. Say “Alexa, find action movies,” and it searches across all your installed streaming apps at once rather than forcing you to check each service individually. Say “Alexa, open Netflix,” and it immediately launches the app without you having to swipe through menus.</p>
<p>This <strong>1080p Full HD resolution strikes a great balance</strong> and offers clear and detailed picture quality above 720p displays without the superfluous expense of 4K panels, which most viewers can’t tell the difference from at 40-inch screen sizes and typical viewing distances. If you’re sitting 6 to 8 feet away from the display, the human eye can’t really detect the difference in resolution between 1080p and 4K unless you stick your face right up against the screen.</p>



<p>The <strong>DTS Virtual-X processing on this set creates virtual three-dimensional sound</strong> from the TV’s integrated speakers, expanding the audio beyond the flat, tinny output most budget TVs produce. While this virtual surround can’t compete with a dedicated speaker system or a soundbar, it meaningfully improves dialogue clarity and makes the audio much more spacious, therefore adding to the movie- or show-watching experience.</p>
<p>Connectivity options range from game console and streaming device hookups via two HDMI ports to legacy equipment with composite <strong>AV jacks, digital optical output for audio systems, a USB port for media playback, headphone jack for private listening, and coaxial jack</strong> for cable or antenna connections. The diversity in this port arrangement caters to everything from minimalist, streaming-only setups to advanced home theater configurations that involve many sources.</p>
<p>At $89, this 40-inch Insignia Fire TV comes in at 40% off retail this Black Friday. If you need a capable TV for a bedroom, kitchen, or any space where 4K feels excessive, this record-low price makes Fire TV functionality accessible to everyone.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/sonos-offloads-move-2-at-zero-margin-portable-speaker-better-than-most-home-systems-goes-for-pennies-2000647037</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/sonos-offloads-move-2-at-zero-margin-portable-speaker-better-than-most-home-systems-goes-for-pennies.1363462/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Sonos represents the high-end tier of wireless audio, and the <strong>Move 2 portable speaker punches well above its weight in terms of sound quality</strong>, considering it’s a <strong>battery-powered mobile unit</strong>. The dual-tweeter architecture combined with the precision-tuned woofer creates a true stereo soundstage that outclasses many dedicated bookshelf speakers that cost hundreds more when the Move 2 is stationary.</p>
<p>At <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5896/">$399, down from $499, this wireless powerhouse has reached a record-low price</a> on Amazon for Black Friday. The combination of audiophile-grade sound, 24-hour battery life, and portability makes this speaker phenomenal for anyone that won’t compromise audio quality.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5896/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Acoustic Architecture That Redefines Portable Audio</h2>
<p>The <strong>new dual tweeter setup supplants the original Move’s single tweeter</strong> configuration for a proper stereo soundstage that separates left and right channels for appropriate spatial audio presentation. What this means in terms of architecture is that vocals sit centered and defined while instruments occupy clear positions across the sound field rather than blending together in mono.</p>
<p>Delivering low frequencies with authority and control, the precision-tuned woofer provides deep bass that is physical in nature without a hint of muddiness or distortion, even at loudest volumes. The dynamic range of live recordings captures the emotional charge and energy of performances without compression, like cheaper portable speakers would do.</p>



<p>The automatic <em>Trueplay</em> feature continuously analyzes the acoustic environment of the Move 2 and <strong>adjusts output in real-time to optimize sound</strong> for wherever you place the speaker. Set it on a wood table, and the system compensates for surface reflections. Move it near a wall, and Trueplay adjusts for boundary reinforcement that can boost bass unnaturally.</p>
<p><strong>Battery performance reaches as high as 24 hours</strong> on a single charge, which represents double the runtime of the original Move despite the more powerful acoustic components. That’s long enough for an entire weekend camping, a full day at the beach, or a multi-day event without having to hunt for outlets. Efficiency improvements come courtesy of refined power management that coordinates amplification, processing, and battery draw.</p>



<p>In contrast, <strong>the IP56 rating gives serious protection against real-world conditions</strong>, not just friendly marketing splash resistance. Rain, dirt, dust, and spills will not destroy internal components or affect operation. The rating means complete dust protection and resistance to strong water jets from all directions, which, in other words, means that during beach trips, pool parties, and backyard gatherings where accidents inevitably happen, survival is assured.</p>
<p>The wireless charging base provides elegant docking which charges the speaker by simply setting it down. The upgraded design now includes a detachable power cable and a more compact adapter for easier packing during travel. The base stays at home for daily charging while USB-PD compatibility offers charging on the go with any USB Power Delivery power supply.</p>
<p>If audiophile-grade sound that travels with you anywhere is what you’re after, this record-low price offers premium portable audio without the usually associated Sonos premium.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/identity-protection-service-drops-70-off-for-black-friday-privacy-now-costs-almost-nothing-2000646900</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/identity-protection-service-drops-70-off-for-black-friday-privacy-now-costs-almost-nothing.1363444/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Black Friday deals are everywhere right now and most of them are pretty forgettable. Another discount on headphones you don’t need, a slightly cheaper subscription to a streaming service you already have-you know the drill. But here’s one that actually caught my attention: NordProtect, the <strong>most popular&nbsp;identity theft protection service</strong>, is running a <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5883/">promotion that drops the price to $4.49 per month, down from the usual $14.99</a>. That’s a 70% discount, and unlike most Black Friday offers, this one addresses a problem that’s getting worse by the day.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5883/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See NordProtect</a></p>
<p>Here’s the thing about identity theft: it’s one of those problems that feels abstract until it happens to you. You hear about data breaches in the news, shrug, change a password or two, and move on with your life. But the numbers tell a different story: <strong>Every 22 seconds, someone in the United States falls victim to identity theft</strong>. Not every hour, not every few minutes-every 22 seconds. The FTC reported that over 1.1 million people filed identity theft cases in 2024, and last year alone, fraud cost consumers more than $12.5 billion, which is a 25% jump from the year before.</p>
<h2>Same Owner as NordVPN</h2>
<p>NordProtect comes from Nord Security, the same company making <em>NordVPN</em> and <em>NordPass</em> which means they are definitely not new in the security game. What they’ve done here is to create a service that handles all the tedious, anxiety-inducing work of keeping your identity safe-so you don’t have to be thinking about it every waking moment of your life.</p>
<p>It <strong>monitors credit reports from all three major bureaus</strong>, watches bank accounts for weird transactions and even actively scans the dark web for your personal information. That last one is of particular note since the dark web is basically the marketplace where stolen data gets traded around and if your info pops up, you want to know about it immediately. You can <a href="https://gizmodo.com/best-vpn/nordvpn/nordprotect">check out Gizmodo’s review of the service</a> for more details on how it performs in real-world usage.</p>
<figure id="attachment_2000646904" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000646904"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000646904">© NordProtect</figcaption></figure>
<p>The monitoring is only the beginning: What makes NordProtect practical is the fact that it doesn’t just tell you something bad happened –<strong> it tells you what to do about it</strong>. When your data shows up in some breach or suspicious activity gets flagged, you get an alert with concrete, actionable steps to take. No vague warnings that leave you Googling <em>“what to do if my email was in a data breach”</em> in the middle of the night.</p>
<h2>Up To $1 Million In Coverage</h2>
<p>Let’s say monitoring fails and you actually become a victim of identity theft. This is where things start to get costly and time-consuming for most people: hours on the phone with banks, credit card companies, credit bureaus, possibly law enforcement. You may want a lawyer. You may miss out on wages while taking time off work to sort it all out. <strong>NordProtect includes up to $1 million in coverage</strong> for eligible recovery costs-which means attorney fees, lost wages, and other expenses that come with cleaning up the mess. There’s also fraud insurance:<strong> as much as $50,000 for online threats or blackmail situations</strong>, and as much as $10,000 if someone actually steals money from your bank or credit card through an online scam.</p>
<p>But what really sets this apart from those credit monitoring services that send you reports is that you get an assigned case manager-not a phone tree, not a chatbot, but a real, live person based in the United States available any time of day or night. And if identity theft does strike, this person becomes your advocate. They’ll do the paperwork, communicate with financial institutions and credit agencies, make sure deadlines aren’t missed, and generally cut through the red tape on your behalf.</p>
<p>The truth is that most of us are walking around with a dozen potential vulnerabilities. We shop online, we use public WiFi, we have accounts on websites that may or may not have great security practices. Each one of those is a potential entry point for someone looking to steal your information. You can’t eliminate the risk entirely-that would require living off the grid-but you can set up a system that catches problems early and helps you fix them quickly.</p>
<p>At $4.49 per month with this Black Friday deal, NordProtect costs less than a single lunch. The service includes a <strong>30-day money-back guarantee</strong> if you decide it’s not for you, so there’s room to test it out. Given that the average identity theft victim spends months recovering and often thousands of dollars in the process, having this kind of safety net feels less like a luxury and more like basic maintenance.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><span>Walt Disney Imagineering—the research and development arm of the Disney parks—will debut a new robot in its Disneyland Paris and Hong Kong parks. </span><i><span>Frozen</span></i><span> fans will certainly be excited to see Olaf the snowman stumbling around the World of Frozen area of Disneyland Paris and Hong Kong Disneyland early next year, but those of us who have always found the icy sidekick unnerving will not be pleased.</span></p> <p><span>Disney’s dedicated an entire episode to Olaf and its history of </span><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EoPN02bmzrE"><span>robots on its Walt Disney Imagineering YouTube channel</span></a><span>. Olaf was created inside Disney Research’s Zurich, and is decidedly smaller than the </span><a href="https://disneyworld.disney.go.com/entertainment/hollywood-studios/character-meet-olaf-frozen/"><span>Olaf’s human-sized character</span></a><span> that goes to Disney meet and greets. He appears to be just under hip height. It seems like he’ll be wandering Disney aimlessly, cursing parkgoers with his unhinged laugh.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><span>“Our latest Olaf is a fantastic example of representing an animated character as authentically as possible in the physical world—a challenging task because animated characters most often move in non-physical ways,” Kyle Laughlin, senior vice president of Walt Disney Imagineering Research &amp; Development, </span><a href="https://thewaltdisneycompany.com/olaf-robotic-character/"><span>said in a news release</span></a><span>. “For example, to make Olaf’s snowball feet move along his body, we paired state-of-the-art deep reinforcement learning with an artistic interface and advances in mechanical design.”</span></p>

 <p><span>Because Olaf is an animated character—and not inherently a robot, like Star Wars droids—Disney had to make “fundamental additions to our reinforcement learning framework to boost the believability of the character by enabling motion at the limit of hardware,” Laughlin said. So, for instance, Olaf’s body is softer, like snow, and you can pull off his nose.</span></p>

 <p><span>The Disney engineers in the video said they used reinforcement learning techniques to teach robots like Olaf and other droids how to act like their characters by ‘watching” artist-made animations. They’ve been through a bunch of iterations throughout the years, starting with a small, humanoid robot that’s shown in the YouTube channel being tripped by a stick. The BDX droids are featured heavily in the episode, too, showcasing how Disney made them more autonomous. They’ve got “eyes” and “ears” to compute what’s going on in the world using AI. So, for instance, if a person kneels down in front of a droid, it’ll move its head to look at the person directly. If they stand up, the droid looks up. It also shows the engineers “choreographing” a performance between three droids that gets recorded to be “played back” as a performance at the parks. And they do that by controlling the droids with what looks like Steam Decks. It’s described as “building blocks for the autonomous show.”</span></p> <p><span>Olaf is the next progression of Disney’s robots, but Disney isn’t clear how Olaf will work—whether it’ll need to be partly controlled by a human or not. The “self” in “self-walking robot” seems to imply that it’ll do a lot of the work itself, though.</span></p>

              <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/what-my-video-game-family-is-bringing-to-thanksgiving-1845758556">Thanksgiving</a> is later this week in the United States. Loads of people are going to be traveling across the country to visit family members, some of whom they like, while eating food and cursing the fact that they have to do this all over again in like three weeks for Christmas. But who cares about all that? We are here to discuss the star of Thanksgiving: The food.</p> <p>What makes a perfect <a href="https://kotaku.com/public-school-thanksgiving-feast-the-kotaku-review-1820327714">Thanksgiving plate</a>? It’s a question that will likely get a lot of different answers, and all of them will be wrong unless they happen to match your perfect platter of tasty treats.</p> <p>For me, I have to have turkey at Thanksgiving. It’s the only time of the year when I’m willing to put the effort into prepping, cooking, and then carving up a giant turkey. And no, turkey isn’t dry or flavorless; you’ve just likely had some poorly cooked turkey. I’ve had turkey that was succulent and packed with flavor. The key is to brine, shield the white meat, and don’t overcook that thing or shove stuffing in it.</p>

 <p>Beyond a few big slices of turkey on my plate, I also have to have fluffy, garlic-y mashed potatoes, sweet corn, steamed but still crunchy broccoli (no cheese!), some stuffing that wasn’t cooked in a turkey, and a few Hawaiian sweet rolls. No gravy needed. Salad optional. It’s Thanksgiving. <a href="https://kotaku.com/bobs-burgers-thanksgiving-episodes-list-ranked-best-1851709655">I’m here to load up on carbs and collapse in front of a TV</a>.</p> <p>But that’s <em>my</em> perfect plate. What are you serving or hoping to be served on Thanksgiving? Let us know in the comments below! We’ll then be back later this week with a follow-up post sharing some of your answers.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>It’s that time of the year again, right before Thanksgiving, when stores and online retailers treat Black Friday as a weeks-long event and not a single day of the year. Strange, but hey, it leads to a lot of great deals, so I’m not complaining.</p> <p>Sony is getting in on the early action with a massive digital PSN store Black Friday sale consisting of a mix of first and third-party PlayStation 5 games, ranging from newer releases, like this year’s <a href="https://kotaku.com/death-stranding-2-review-is-it-good-ps5-playstation-5-1851784852"><em>Death Stranding 2,</em></a> to older hits like <em>The Last of Us </em>and <em>Spider-Man.</em> <a href="https://store.playstation.com/en-us/category/99d2af65-6386-4f11-a1f9-94d1e9c84063/1">This big Black Friday PSN sale goes from now until December 1.</a> So buy some games for yourselves and enjoy them. You deserve it. 2025 was a mess.</p>

 <p>I’ve also highlighted some great deals on non-exclusive PS5 games. <em>Battlefield 6</em> currently has its hooks in me so deep that I might have to uninstall it to actually play other stuff. <em>Dying Light: The Beast</em> is great, but not a huge open-world zombie game that is easily worth $48. <em>Assassin’s Creed Shadows</em> is probably my favorite game in the franchise since <em>Origins</em>, and at under $50, it’s a steal. For folks looking for some creepy scares over holiday break, <em>Silent Hill 2 </em>and <em>Silent Hill f</em> might just be what you’re looking for, and both are fantastic. And if you have a spouse or sibling who is free this Thanksgiving, <em>Split Fiction</em> might just be the perfect co-op adventure to complete while munching on leftovers.</p> <p>Anyway, here are some of the best exclusives we spotted in the sale. Plus, below that list is <em>another</em> list of other great games that are cheaper than normal until next month.</p> <h2>PlayStation 5 Console Exclusives</h2> <ul> <li><em>Death Stranding 2 –</em> $50 ($70)</li> <li><em>Astro Bot</em> – $40 ($60)</li> <li><em>Baby Steps</em> – $15 ($20)</li> <li><em>Marvel’s Spider-Man 2</em> – $30 ($70)</li> <li><em>Marvel’s Spider-Man: Miles Morales</em> – $30 ($70)</li> <li><em>The Last of Us Part I&nbsp;</em>– $30 ($70)</li> <li><em>The Last of Us Complete&nbsp;</em>– $70 ($100)</li> <li><em>Final Fantasy VII Rebirth&nbsp;</em>– $35 ($70)</li> <li><em>Horizon Forbidden West Complete Edition&nbsp;</em>– $40 ($60)</li> </ul> <hr> <h2>Other Great Games On Sale</h2> <ul> <li><em>Battlefield 6</em> – $60 ($70)</li> <li><em>Clair Obscura – Expedition 33</em> – $40 ($50)</li> <li><em>Dying Light: The Beast</em> – $48 ($60)</li> <li><em>Stellar Blade</em> – $40 ($70)</li> <li><em>Assassin’s Creed Shadows</em> – $42 ($70)</li> <li><em>Forza Horizon 5</em> – $39 ($60)</li> <li><em>Gears of War: Reloaded</em> – $26 ($40)</li> <li><em>Ready or Not</em> – $40 ($50)</li> <li><em>Kingdom Come: Deliverance II</em> – $42 ($70)</li> <li><em>Silent Hill f</em> – $49 ($70)</li> <li><em>Silent Hill 2</em> – $35 ($70)</li> <li><em>Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater</em> – $49 ($70)</li> <li><em>The Outer Worlds 2</em> – $56 ($70)</li> <li><em>Split Fiction</em> – $40 ($50)</li> <li><em>The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion Remastered</em> – $35 ($50)</li> <li><em>Grand Theft Auto IV</em> – $20 ($40)</li> <li><em>Mortal Kombat 1</em> – $10 ($50)</li> <li><em>Cyberpunk 2077: Ultimate Ed.</em> – $43 ($71)</li> <li><em>Star Wars Jedi Survivor</em> – $11 ($70)</li> <li><em>Warhammer 40k: Space Marine 2</em> – $35 ($70)</li> <li><em>Star Wars: Outlaws</em> – $21 ($70)</li> <li><em>Hell Is Us</em> – $42 ($60)</li> <li><em>Resident Evil Remake Trilogy</em> (2,3,4) – $41 ($90)</li> </ul>

              <p>At its best, <a href="https://kotaku.com/vampire-masquerade-bloodlines-2-phyre-patience-2000643607"><i>Bloodlines 2</i> can be a good time</a>, especially when you just focus on the compelling story and writing. It can even be a fun vampire power fantasy from time to time. It has its charm in places, sure, but it almost never earns its name or identity as the sequel to the 2004 cult-hit <i>Vampire: The Masquerade – Bloodlines</i>. Turns out, its developer agrees: It never should’ve been named <i>Bloodlines 2</i>.</p> <p><b>Read More:</b> <a href="https://kotaku.com/vampire-masquerade-bloodlines-2-phyre-patience-2000643607"><i>Vampire: The Masquerade – Bloodlines 2</i> Was So Close To Being Something Special</a></p> <p>Dan Pinchbeck, co-founder of The Chinese Room and writer of <i>Bloodlines 2</i>’s story, recently spoke about the early days of taking over <i>Bloodlines 2</i> with Cat Burton on <i>The Goth Boss Podcast</i> (<a href="https://www.pcgamesn.com/vampire-the-masquerade-bloodlines-2/interview-chinese-room-paradox">h/t <i>PCGamesN</i></a>), saying that while he was eager to create a game set in <i>Vampire: The Masquerade</i>, he didn’t just want to drag previous developer Hardsuit Lab’s work across the finish line. And he most certainly didn’t want to call it <i>Bloodlines 2</i>. He told Burton:</p>

 <blockquote><p>We would sit there and go and have these planning sessions on ‘how do we get [Paradox] to not call it <i>Bloodlines 2</i>?’ That feels like the most important thing that we can do here, is come at this and say ‘this isn’t <i>Bloodlines 2</i>, you can’t make it <i>Bloodlines 2</i>. There’s not enough time and there’s not enough money.’</p></blockquote> <p>Pinchbeck would leave The Chinese Room in 2023, shortly after the team took on the <i>Bloodlines 2</i> project.</p>  <h2>Would a name change have made that much of a difference?</h2> <p>“No one would be happy,” Pinchbeck said about trying to deliver a more direct sequel, something truer to the original <i>Bloodlines</i>’ RPG spirit. “We sort of approached it from [the] point of view of ‘what <i>can</i> we do with the time and the money that’s available?’” he said, “we can’t make <i>Bloodlines 2</i>, we can’t make <i>Skyrim</i>, but we can make <i>Dishonored</i>.”</p>

 <p>It’s hard not to play <i>Bloodlines 2</i> and feel the <i>Dishonored </i>inspiration. Though you do explore an open world, it’s tiny; and while scripted dialogue scenes in the final product are often excellent, <i>Bloodlines 2</i> hardly has the kinds of character interactions and sidequests that made the original notable. That leaves behind a first-person game where you wield supernatural powers, often steathily, against your opponents. Sound familiar?</p>

 <p>I’m not sure if a different name would’ve made for a significantly better reception for <i>Bloodlines 2</i>. In fact, it might not’ve been talked about nearly as much if it wasn’t called <i>Bloodlines 2</i>. Games like <a href="https://kotaku.com/vampire-masquerade-swansong-impressions-rpg-tabletop-bl-1848939458"><i>Vampire: The Masquerade – Swansong</i></a> and <i>Werewolf: The Apocalypse – Heart of the Forest</i> are far better games set in the World of Darkness, the broader mythos of <i>VtM</i> which it shares with other games like <i>Werewolf</i>. Though at least those games weren’t burdened with the expectation that led up to <i>Bloodlines 2</i>’s eventual release.</p> <p>Much like <i>Werewolf: The Apocalypse – Earthblood</i>, a differently-named <i>Bloodlines 2</i> would’ve otherwise been just a mediocre action game that at best appeals to a niche audience of TTRPG fanatics. That’s presently what it is anyway, regardless of the name it bears.</p>
