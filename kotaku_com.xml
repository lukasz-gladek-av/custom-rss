              <p>We are still firmly in the <a href="https://kotaku.com/dune-popcorn-bucket-barbie-ghostbusters-best-worst-1851336690#content">‚ÄúGimmick Popcorn Bucket Era‚Äù of movie theaters</a>, and it shows no signs of stopping. Usually, these gimmicky popcorn buckets are items that fans want to buy and collect. But it seems like not many people want the creepy bucket for <em>The Conjuring: Last Rites</em>, featuring iconic haunted doll Annabelle. I wonder why.</p> <p>On August 18, Regal Cinema shared a photo of its popcorn bucket for the upcoming horror film, <em>The Conjuring: Last Rites,</em> the ninth (?!) film in the wildly popular <em>Conjuring</em> series. The movie is being marketed as a sort of ending for this era of the spooky franchise, though it sounds like more <a href="https://kotaku.com/netflix-best-horror-movies-1851282873/5"><em>Conjuring</em> universe</a> movies will happen in the future. Anyway, <a href="https://youtu.be/FSAz556s0fM">as seen in <em>Last Rites‚Äô</em> new trailer</a>, the franchise‚Äôs famous haunted doll, Annabelle, is returning for the <em>Conjuring‚Äôs</em> finale. And to celebrate, Regal‚Äôs new popcorn bucket features the doll herself, connected to a faux-wooden bucket with the movie‚Äôs logo slapped on it. The bucket will be available to order on Wednesday, over two weeks before the movie‚Äôs release.</p> <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">She's been released once more‚Ä¶ Annabelle popcorn buckets coming to Regal this Wednesday.üçø <a href="https://t.co/9cPobQ1Nkt">pic.twitter.com/9cPobQ1Nkt</a></p> <p>‚Äî Regal (@RegalMovies) <a href="https://twitter.com/RegalMovies/status/1957476386852979164?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">August 18, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <p>In the <em>Conjuring</em> universe, where she has three of her own spin-off movies as well as appearances in the main series, Annabelle is portrayed as scary, dangerous, evil, and just generally not a good doll you want to take home. I wasn‚Äôt surprised, then, that a lot of fans online don‚Äôt want this cursed piece of plastic in their homes.</p>

 <p>‚ÄúOh hell no lol,‚Äù said one user. ‚ÄúUm, that‚Äôs one bucket I don‚Äôt want,‚Äù said another person. Someone else replied: ‚ÄúY‚Äôall can keep that one.‚Äù</p> <p>‚ÄúAm I supposed to take this home?‚Äù asked someone in a reply to <em>DiscussingFilm</em>‚Äòs tweet about the doll bucket. A diffferent user replied to the same tweet with: ‚Äú<span>Nah nah nah nah you‚Äôre not gonna get me Annabelle, nice try.‚Äù</span></p> <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">Haunt your popcorn with our <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/TheConjuring?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#TheConjuring</a>: Last Rites Annabelle popcorn bucket available starting August 22! <a href="https://t.co/UiYfek3Nft">pic.twitter.com/UiYfek3Nft</a></p> <p>‚Äî Cinemark Theatres (@Cinemark) <a href="https://twitter.com/Cinemark/status/1957534818465726527?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">August 18, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <p>Meanwhile, on Monday, Cinemark shared a first look at its own <em>Conjuring 4</em> popcorn bucket and uh, well, reactions were different. That‚Äôs mainly because Cinemark‚Äôs gimmick bucket featuring Annabelle makes you eat the popcorn out of her ass. Would Tom Cruise eat popcorn out of Annabelle‚Äôs ass? Probably, the dude loves popcorn. But others aren‚Äôt as interested. This bucket will be available on Friday, August 22.</p> <p><em>The Conjuring: Last Rites,</em> alongside all the fake Annabelle popcorn buckets you desire (or fear), arrives in theaters on September 5.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              
              <p>Everyone is waiting for <em>Hollow Knight: Silksong</em> to come out. It‚Äôs the most wishlisted game on Steam. You can‚Äôt watch <a href="https://kotaku.com/silksong-hollow-knight-switch-2-screenshots-date-1851775219">a new gaming showcase these days</a> without the chat being flooded with stuff like ‚ÄúShow<em> Silksong</em>? Where is <em>Silksong</em>? <em>Silksong</em> when?‚Äù Due out before the end of 2025, time is running out for a release date announcement or even a same-day shadow-drop. <a href="https://kotaku.com/gamescom-2024-e3-microsoft-gaming-show-1851638178">With Gamescom 2025 Opening Night Live</a> just around the corner, could this finally be the moment of truth? Host Geoff Keighley is certainly acting like it.</p> <p>Gaming‚Äôs veteran hype man has been sharing images of Gamescom ONL prep, including one of him in front of a mirror wearing a clown nose. It‚Äôs a clear wink to the <a href="https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/hollow-knight-silksong-fans-in-clown-makeup"><em>Silksong</em> fanart clown makeup meme</a> about perpetual disappointment. The trend started years ago when developer Team Cherry was MIA, but hit a new fever pitch after Xbox claimed <em>Silksong</em> would arrive in 2022, only for it to never come out. Many gaming showcases have come and gone since, with the Metroidvanaia Soulslike only ever appearing briefly as part of a sizzle reel here and there.</p> <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">First time? ü§° </p> <p>See you tomorrow for <a href="https://twitter.com/gamescom?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@gamescom</a> ONL. <a href="https://t.co/59ef5sFysJ">pic.twitter.com/59ef5sFysJ</a></p> <p>‚Äî Geoff Keighley (@geoffkeighley) <a href="https://twitter.com/geoffkeighley/status/1957492830374650018?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">August 18, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <p>Keighley is either tipping his hand that big <em>Silksong</em> news is just around the corner or paving the way for the biggest collective letdown ever. Since the game will be playable at <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/HollowKnight/comments/1mjunk6/silksong_confirmed_to_be_playable_at_the_nintendo/">multiple booths</a> on the Gamescom show floor, my money‚Äôs on the former. It‚Äôs coming to Switch but has also been promised to be available day-one on the Xbox Ally PC gaming handheld, rumored to release in October. Plus, the soundtrack was j<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/HollowKnight/comments/1mtoufc/silksongs_ost_has_been_added_to_gog_though/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=mweb3x&amp;utm_name=mweb3xcss&amp;utm_term=1">ust added to the backend of GOG</a>.</p>

  <p>Keighley‚Äôs showcase will take place on August 19, 2025, at 2:00 p.m. ET. It will run approximately two hours with a pre-show that starts at 1:30 p.m. ET. You can stream it live on both <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HVC_dBNUZGc">YouTube</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=74oh7zD_jxI">Twitch</a>. The event tends to have new game announcements sprinkled in with trailers and updates on already revealed games coming out in the next few months, plus occasionally brief intros from the developers themselves. This year‚Äôs Gamescom ONL will also include a live orchestra performance of music from surprise hit <em>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</em> and the first footage <a href="https://kotaku.com/fallout-season-2-teaser-images-new-vegas-lucky-38-mr-house-lucy-2000618233">of <em>Fallout</em> season 2</a>.</p> <p><iframe loading="lazy" title="gamescom Opening Night Live 2025" width="500" height="375" src="about:blank" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen="" data-rocket-lazyload="fitvidscompatible" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/HVC_dBNUZGc?feature=oembed"></iframe></p> <h2>What games will be shown at Gamescom ONL?</h2> <p>Beyond the tease for <em>Silksong</em>, Keighley has already confirmed the following nine games will also make an appearance:</p> <ul data-cy="list"> <li><em>Call of Duty: Black Ops 7</em></li> <li><em>Resident Evil Requiem</em></li> <li><em>Ghost of Yotei</em></li> <li><em>Ninja Gaiden 4</em></li> <li><em>The Outer Worlds 2</em></li> <li><em>Silent Hill f</em></li> <li><em>World of Warcraft: Midnight</em></li> <li><em>Black Myth: Wukong</em></li> <li><em>Lords of the Fallen 2</em></li> </ul> <p><em>Black Ops 7</em> is expected to reveal the first footage from its updated multiplayer, while<a href="https://kotaku.com/black-myth-wukong-xbox-ps5-exclusivity-date-sale-1851783817"><em> Black Myth: Wukong</em></a> is headed to Xbox this week and could potentially be showing off its long-rumored DLC expansion. With no BlizzCon this year, Microsoft will also be using ONL to debut the next <em>World of Warcraft</em> expansion, though a much bigger deal would be if it ever gets a much-requested console port. And what about <em>Diablo 4</em>‚Äòs recently leaked Paladin subclass, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/diablo4/comments/1mq4i45/the_d4_vendor_builds_were_updated_and_it_looks/">rumored</a> to be part of its next expansion? <em>The Outer Worlds 2</em> is Microsoft‚Äôs other big fall release, but with few updates on its biggest in-development games at its Xbox showcase in June, there are plenty of other big releases that could make surprise appearances at ONL.</p> <p>We haven‚Äôt heard much from Ubisoft this year either. Amid big delays and internal restructurings, the French publisher declined to hold its usual Summer Game Fest-adjacent June showcase. With the next <em>Far Cry</em>, <em>Ghost Recon</em>, and<em> Splinter Cell</em> remakes all in development, any one of them could get a tease at Gamescom. The developers behind <em>The Division 2</em> have already <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/thedivision/comments/1mtq98p/the_division_2s_gamescom_schedule_this_week/">teased</a> news on the ongoing loot shooter‚Äôs big winter update. Who knows, maybe Gamescom 2025 is when <a href="https://kotaku.com/beyond-good-evil-2-bg-e2-director-release-date-dead-1851679744"><em>Beyond Good and Evil 2</em> will finally resurface</a>!</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              
              <p>The next <em>Skate</em> game from EA, which is often called <a href="https://kotaku.com/skate-4-ea-full-circle-free-to-play-microtransactions-1849179812"><em>Skate 4</em></a> online by fans, is set to arrive via an early access launch later this year. And in a new blog from the devs behind the reboot, we learned that music is a big part of the upcoming skateboarding game and that a whole lotta people will be able to play it together online.</p> <p>This new <em>Skate</em> game was first officially announced all the way back <a href="https://kotaku.com/ea-has-finally-announced-a-new-skate-game-1844087679">in June 2020</a>. And over the years, <a href="https://kotaku.com/skate-4-ea-leaked-alpha-beta-build-pc-devs-1849176399">the game has leaked numerous times</a> while EA has also <a href="https://kotaku.com/ea-skate-4-pre-alpha-gameplay-video-full-circle-session-1849131150">released official early footage of it</a> and brought in fans to playtest it. The development of <em>Skate</em> (which is not called<em> Skate 4</em> for some reason) has been remarkably transparent, and as part of this, <a href="https://www.ea.com/ea-studios/full-circle">developers Full Circle</a> have released regular blog posts sharing new details about the reboot. And in the latest one, the devs shared a bunch of information on how music‚Äìa very important part of any good skateboarding game‚Äìwill work in <em>Skate</em>.</p> <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">üö®We will be inviting all registered skate. Insiders to come playtest in July. Check your emails.</p> <p>The latest build has improved textures and lighting, more challenges, and changes to our progression system. <a href="https://t.co/fyjxtOj3qi">pic.twitter.com/fyjxtOj3qi</a></p> <p>‚Äî skate. (@skate) <a href="https://twitter.com/skate/status/1935027470480330760?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">June 17, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <p><a href="https://www.ea.com/games/skate/skate/news/the-grind-vol-five">In the most recent installment of ‚ÄúThe Grind,‚Äù</a> EA and Full Circle announced that <em>Skate</em> will launch with ‚Äúabout 100‚Äù songs. These songs will be grouped into different, themed playlists that will act like radio stations. Players will be free to like songs and create their own playlist of favorites. There will also be a playlist that will feature songs other players are listening to and liking, which will update over time. As for what kind of music to expect in <em>Skate</em>, Full Circle says the team is ‚Äúfocused on emerging artists‚Äù and that they included some ‚Äúdeep cuts‚Äù that the devs hope will help players ‚Äúdiscover‚Äù new favorites.</p>

 <p>EA and Full Circle also plan to add new songs to the game as it changes live-service seasons every three months. It also sounds like music that‚Äôs less popular with players might leave the game, but EA says it will make sure that the tracks you favorite and enjoy stick around in <em>Skate</em> ‚Äúfor longer.‚Äù</p> <p>While losing music is a bit of a shame, I‚Äôm excited to hear devs promising regular music updates. With live-service games that players are expected to play for months or years, new music being added over time can help reinvigorate things. There are only so many times you can hear the same tunes over and over before starting to hate them. As someone who has played <em>GTA Online</em> for over a decade, trust me on this.</p> <p>In the latest blog post, the devs also said that the team is aiming for about 150 players per server session. And yes, in case you forgot or weren‚Äôt aware, <a href="https://kotaku.com/skate-4-reboot-ea-no-offline-mode-always-online-2025-1851777885"><em>Skate</em> is an always-online free-to-play skating game</a>, so multiplayer is a big part of the equation. <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Skate4/comments/1ln0xu4/comment/n0c50t1/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button">Over on Reddit</a>, players who have been involved in playtesting have suggested that servers only supported 80 players during their time with the game, but that EA wanted to up that number to 150, which the blog confirms. 150 players is a lot, so hopefully <em>Skate</em>‚Äòs open world is large enough to support all those skateboarding hooligans listening to music and popping kick flips.</p> <p><em>Skate 4</em> aka the <em>Skate</em> reboot <a href="https://kotaku.com/ea-skate-4-reboot-release-date-early-access-2025-pc-ps5-1851650367">doesn‚Äôt have a specific release date yet</a>, but EA says it will be available on PlayStation, Xbox, and PC via early access at the end of the summer.</p>
