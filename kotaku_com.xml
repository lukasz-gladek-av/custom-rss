Do better people holy fuck.”</p><p> The growing discontent has led GameStop to institute a new rule for the upcoming Destined Rivals launch. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.instagram.com/p/DJ4oVy4SvoG/?igsh=MnBuejF3MXdmdWM0&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.instagram.com/p/DJ4oVy4SvoG/?igsh=MnBuejF3MXdmdWM0" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Announced on Tuesday</a></span>, new  Pokémon TCG releases will now be limited to one unit per customer. So whether they’re aiming to snag single boosters or entire boxes, more people should have more shots at getting what they came for. It should also disincentive scalpers from swamping stores on days that new packs come out.</p><p>“Finally!” responded one person on Instagram. “I just saw a scalper fall to his knees at GameStop,” wrote another. Many were disappointed the change didn’t come sooner. “If only this rule was applied when the Prismatic Super Premium Collection dropped, I would have been able to get one,” another person wrote. Many locations had been giving out two per customer for Prismatic, even though stores were getting as few as 10 boxes in total. </p><p>Adding to some of the confusion has been a burgeoning ecosystem of communities and apps like Popfindr that help people track which stores are getting new stock for which sets when. Like whiskey nerds waiting outside liquor stores on small batch delivery days, some GameStop employees have noticed customers coming in asking them about store shipments they weren’t even aware of. “This app that people are using to get our inventory is actually starting to piss me off,” one GameStop employee <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/GameStop/comments/1kimvqr/exhausted_of_tcg/?share_id=flq9LrVDsRcJLimE6qh8T&amp;utm_content=1&amp;utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_name=androidcss&amp;utm_source=share&amp;utm_term=1&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GameStop/comments/1kimvqr/exhausted_of_tcg/?share_id=flq9LrVDsRcJLimE6qh8T&amp;utm_content=1&amp;utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_name=androidcss&amp;utm_source=share&amp;utm_term=1" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">wrote on Reddit</a></span>. “Is anyone experiencing that at all? People have updates of when we get our shipment and it’s weird. I’ve had numerous phone calls and people coming in store telling me I received a shipment with quantity amounts. It’s frustrating.”<br></p><p>Despite the lowkey chaos, GameStop has only doubled down on the Pokémon TCG market since it announced it would start grading and reselling cards last year. Some stores have become “takeover stores” where walls that used to be lined with games, Funko Pops, or other collectibles have been completely given over to displaying <em>Pokémon</em> TCG packs, only for them to get completely wiped out just days later. Once a bystander in that boom-bust cycle, GameStop now stands to profit off the hype of people reselling valuable cards. </p><p>“As a card collector myself, I hate what the hobby has turned into and frankly, I wouldn’t even feel upset if GS stops selling TCG because there are just so many bad apples that ruin it for everyone,,” one fan commented on Reddit. “Like it is totally NOT OK for vendors and restockers to have to worry about being stalked because a scalper air tagged their car. It sucks that to even have a chance in getting cards for the hobby, you pretty much need to camp ahead of release day.”</p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

He’s starred in huge movies and franchises. He’s pulled off some of the most amazing stunts ever performed on film. And he’s become Hollywood’s ambassador of Going To The Movies. But I can’t relate to any of that. So let’s talk instead about how this famous dude seems be a big movie theater popcorn sicko. </p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="197567" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="Nintendo Switch 2 Price Is Set at $450 for Now, But Could Go Higher" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="104" data-playlist="197567,197565,197564" data-current="197567"><div><p>Nintendo Switch 2 Price Is Set at $450 for Now, But Could Go Higher</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197567/197567_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197567/197567_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197567/197567_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/23091.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>On May 20, the official <em>Mission: Impossible</em> Twitter account posted a short video of Cruise <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://x.com/mikeryan/status/1924256925425832373&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://x.com/mikeryan/status/1924256925425832373" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">chatting up AMC employees</a></span> during a big pre-release screening of the latest entry in the long-running series. As he talks about the upcoming  film, <em>Final Reckoning</em>, Cruise can be seen eating popcorn in his distinctive way. </p><p>We can also see the famous actor munching on popcorn in this same way in a different video recently posted to social media. Once again, Cruise can be seen carrying a bucket of popcorn with one hand and chucking small handfuls of the snack food into his mouth with the other. </p><p>It’s a bit odd, but it looks cooler than how I eat popcorn at a movie theater. (I just grab a big handful of the stuff, smoosh it into my face, and eat it like a pony being fed at a petting zoo.) </p><p>If these were the only clips of Tom Cruise eating popcorn, well, I’d not be writing this blog. But this is just the latest evidence that Tom Cruise, the movie star, is a popcorn sicko. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://x.com/tcarchive0220/status/1924387860771389573&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://x.com/tcarchive0220/status/1924387860771389573" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Here’s a clip of him leaving that AMC theater while eating more popcorn</a></span>. There’s also a video of Cruise <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://x.com/Todd_Spence/status/1924891629368049696&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://x.com/Todd_Spence/status/1924891629368049696" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">walking by someone and pointing out</a></span> that they already ate all of their popcorn before the movie had even started. Here’s a clip from 2015 of Cruise warning people to hold onto their popcorn during that year’s big <em>Mission: Impossible </em>movie, <em>Rogue Nation</em>.</p><p>Apparently, before this recent <em>Final Reckoning </em>screening, Cruise asked the assembled audience of critics and reporters if they all had popcorn. Once he seemed satisfied that, yes, they all had plenty of the popular buttery snack, he then admitted how much popcorn he eats during a movie. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://x.com/RachelLeishman/status/1924527232921264149&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://x.com/RachelLeishman/status/1924527232921264149" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Cruise reportedly eats two buckets of popcorn</a></span> while enjoying a film. As someone who has had to routinely leave a movie right before it starts to refill my bucket, I get it, dude. </p><p>I am far from the first person to recognize that Cruise really seems to have an affinity for the stuff. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://youtu.be/e3QOQ-skVJs&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://youtu.be/e3QOQ-skVJs" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">In 2023, a short video of Cruise eating popcorn</a></span> and talking about how much he loved it went semi-viral.</p><p>“I love my popcorn. Movies. Popcorn,” said Cruise in the 2023 clip. And I have to agree with the man. Movie theater popcorn rocks.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
