            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Amidst ambiguous <a href="https://www.thegamer.com/playstation-might-stop-launching-exclusives-pc-steam-jez-corden-claims/">rumblings</a> that Sony might be tiring of its experiments with porting first-party single-player PlayStation games to PC, if even at all true it’s certainly not looking imminent. <em>Death Stranding 2: On the Beach</em>, only released for the PS5 in June this year, now has an ESRB rating <a href="https://www.gematsu.com/2025/11/esrb-rates-death-stranding-2-on-the-beach-for-pc">spotted by&nbsp;<em>Gematsu</em></a>, suggesting Hideo Kojima’s sequel might be arriving on PC pretty soon.</p> <p>Over the last five or so years, Sony has mostly been porting its big, flagship single-player PlayStation games to PC after a couple of years of console exclusivity and a post-release glow-up. For instance, <em>God of War: Ragnarok</em> was released on PS5 in November 2022, then in September 2024 arrived on PC in a fancy, graphically enhanced version with its DLC campaign included. The same was true of 2023’s&nbsp;<em>Marvel’s Spider-Man 2</em> arriving&nbsp;on PC at the start of 2025, 2022’s <em>Horizon Forbidden West</em> hitting PC in 2024, and pretty much every other first-party title in the PS5 generation.</p>

 <p>However, when it comes to Kojima’s&nbsp;<em>Death Stranding 2: On the Beach</em>, PC players may only have to wait for a handful of months. According to <a href="https://www.esrb.org/ratings/41057/death-stranding-2-on-the-beach/">the ESRB listing</a>, the game has been given the same M rating as the PS5 version, meaning the board has presumably played a build. That suggests it must be pretty close.</p>

 <p>The original&nbsp;<em>Death Stranding</em> also had a surprisingly short gap between its PS4 release and a port to PC, taking just eight months to make the transition. However, that time publishing for the PC build was handled by Italian group, 505 Games. This time the listing has the publisher registered as Sony Interactive Entertainment.</p> <p>So could the bonkers delivery simulator sequel be hitting PC even faster? A listing now suggests it might be out as soon as the New Year. Or perhaps match that eight month wait and arrive in February. Either way, it’s a lot better than waiting the usual two years!</p>

            <title><![CDATA[PS5 Digital Edition (Slim) Hits No-Margin Price as Sony Offloads the Last Units After Moving 20K+ Units Last Month]]></title>
            <link>https://kotaku.com/this-100-off-black-friday-deal-on-the-playstation-5-digital-slim-edition-is-going-fast-at-amazon-2000647329</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/ps5-digital-edition-slim-hits-no-margin-price-as-sony-offloads-the-last-units-after-moving-20k-units-last-month.1365151/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Remember the Great PlayStation 5 Panic that hit every holiday season between 2020 and 2023? Relax, we’re not back to those supply-chain nightmare days. But this <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5946/">Amazon Black Friday deal on the Slim Digital Edition of the PS5 — a big $100 price cut down to $399</a> — is moving with alarming speed, so much so that it might not make it to actual Black Friday. If you weren’t planning on starting your holiday shopping until Black Friday or even Cyber Monday, you might want to rethink that plan if you want to score a PS5 Digital Edition (Slim).</p>
<p>The PS5 Slim’s skinny-sounding name has nothing to do with its gaming power or capabilities, which are fully present. The console itself is about 30% smaller than the first iteration of the PS5. The slender design and the fact it plays equally well when set up in vertical or horizontal position makes is easier to position on your gaming desk or close to your TV in whichever room you’re gaming in. (The vertical stand is sold separately.)</p>

<h2>Best Deal of 2025</h2>
<p>The last time the PS5 Digital Slim Edition was priced this low was roughly this time one year ago. Since then it’s stubbornly remained in the high-$400s range, but Black Friday 2025 has brought with it a $100 drop — and a serious rush on supply. That’s unsurprising considering the PlayStation’s dominance of the console gaming market, and the PS5’s undisputed reign as the premier console since its release in November 2020. Single-player gaming or online group play are equally fun and immersive, and the number of games that run optimally on the PS5 numbers into the hundreds.</p>
<p>This Slim edition is digital-only — no disc drive present or needed. The digital games load faster and play faster, with far less lag. The internal SSD is a full terabyte in size so you can download new games, updates, and DLCs at will. All you need is a PlayStation Network membership that gives you access to the PlayStation Store to find and download games, and this version of the PS5 comes with <em>Astro’s Playroom</em> pre-installed to get your started.</p>



<h2>Immersive Gaming</h2>
<p>The smaller, slimmer body of this console is jammed with great, advanced gaming features. It supports haptic feedback, adaptive triggers, and 3D audio technology via TV speakers or USB stereo headphones. It supports 4K gaming, is backwards-compatible with PS4 games (digital only), and comes with a DualSense Wireless Controller, power cord, and USB cable.</p>
<p>If you beat the rush and score a PlayStation 5 Digital Slim console during this Amazon deal, your next stop should be the PlayStation Store, where there’s another Black Friday sale happening right now which includes hot new digital games like&nbsp;<em>The Outer Worlds 2</em> and hot titles like&nbsp;<em>NBA 2K26</em>,&nbsp;<em>Death Stranding 2: On the Beach</em>,&nbsp;<em>Marvel’s Spider-Man 2</em>, and over 650 more. They all play fast and furious on the ultra-quick SSD of the PlayStation 5 Digital Slim. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5946/">But first you have to beat the rush to Amazon and grab one of these consoles for just $399 before this Black Friday deal runs out.</a></p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/lego-takes-zero-profit-gamble-on-minecraft-set-40k-units-cleared-already-at-pocket-change-2000647525</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>The <strong>combination of LEGO and Minecraft naturally resonates with kids</strong> who grew up building virtual worlds block by block and now get to recreate those experiences with physical bricks. Judging by the o<strong>ver 40,000 units Amazon moved</strong> since this deal went live, this partnership seems to be a massive success and proves that the iconic Creeper mob translated into 665 pieces hits differently when priced right.</p>
<p>And the good news is that Amazon<a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5126/"> dropped this buildable Minecraft figure to $31 from its usual $39 for Black Friday</a>, which marks a record low that makes this detailed construction set affordable instead of something parents bookmark and forget.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5126/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Favorite LEGO Minecraft Set</h2>
<p>The <strong>665-piece build provides hours of satisfaction</strong> without being overly complex or tedious, as with many repetitive builds. You build up the Creeper’s iconic, pixelated look brick by brick, reproducing the blocky aesthetic of the original mob that defined Minecraft’s look and made it so unmistakable across all gaming culture.</p>
<p><strong>Four poseable legs</strong> let you adjust from menacing walk to explosive lunge for added play value beyond simple display, allowing builders to create dynamic poses that match their vision. A<strong> detachable head</strong> reveals a surprise compartment inside and contains a first-version Minecraft mini-figure and TNT element which adds an element of discovery for when the builder explores the model beyond surface-level construction.</p>



<p>The <strong>finished model stands over 8 inches tall</strong>, and provides enough physical presence to command attention on shelves or desks without dominating entire rooms like some massive Lego sets that require dedicated display furniture. Color accuracy matches the Creeper’s green and black color scheme perfectly and uses the right shades that</p>
<p>The early version of the mini-figure included represents early Minecraft character designs and adds collectible value for fans appreciative of the game’s evolution and history. The TNT element references the Creeper’s explosive nature, the defining trait that made this mob so terrifying to encounter in-game and so iconic within gaming culture. These small touches speak to attention to Minecraft lore rather than slapping the brand name on generic building sets, rewarding fans who get the reference and appreciate authentic representation.</p>



<p>Construction follows LEGO’s typical excellent quality in its instruction, with clear numbered steps and visual diagrams that preclude confusion and minimize frustration. <strong>Young builders aged 10 and up</strong> can complete this independently, though the complexity level provides enough challenge to keep the build engaging rather than mindlessly simple. The finished Creeper serves as both a building accomplishment and a gaming tribute, bridging physical and digital play in ways that resonate with kids who live in both worlds.</p>
<p>At $31 instead of $39, you save $8 on a LEGO Minecraft set that provides authentic mob representation, interactive poseable elements, hidden surprises, and display-worthy construction at a price that makes gift-giving or self-purchasing financially painless.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/beats-kicks-black-friday-celebrations-off-by-taking-200-off-its-studio-pro-headphones-2000647235</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/beats-studio-pro-is-nearly-60-off-as-an-amazon-exclusive-deal-apple-might-as-well-be-giving-it-away-this-black-friday.1365133/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Beats — owned by Apple — makes some of our favorite audio solutions out there. The audio quality is impressive, and the headphones play nicely with both iOS and Android devices. If you’ve been looking to grab a new pair, we come bearing great news.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5945/">Thanks to Black Friday, Amazon is currently offering a massive 57% discount on the premium Beats Studio Pro, which brings the price down to $150 from $350.</a> Prime members can save an additional $13 with free delivery. It’s one of the hottest deals on the retailer right now and is selling out fast. We recommend jumping in on it before the price shoots back up to the not-so-friendly $350 tag.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5945/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Three Sound Profiles, Two Listening Modes</h2>
<p>Looks-wise, Beats stuck to its typical over-ear design with these, which is not a bad thing. The upgraded UltraPlush over-ear cushions flaunt premium, engineered leather designed for all-day comfort. Pressure is distributed evenly across both sides with the headband, making it easier to have these on for hours without feeling uneasy. Survive longer commutes, take back-to-back meetings, or just push through a busy day without constantly adjusting them or taking them off to let your ears breathe.</p>
<p>Comfort alone can’t do it all, which is why sound quality is just as top-notch. The brand claims the Beats Studio Pro are its most powerful, precise over-ear headphones to date, and we don’t doubt that. Rich, balanced sound comes from upgraded drivers with a two-layer diaphragm, refined micro-venting, and 25% stronger magnetics that reduce distortion to zero, even when you have pumped the volume all the way up. Three distinct sound profiles take customization to a whole new level. There’s the signature profile to deliver a balanced output, the entertainment profile for a more immersive streaming experience, and the conversation profile for clearer calls or podcasts.</p>



<p>Listening modes include Active Noise Cancelation and Transparency. The adaptive ANC is smart enough to monitor the sound around you and create a precisely-tuned filter to cancel it out. It’s great for when you want to focus on a task, or just feel the tunes down to your bones without background distractions. Of course, you can’t always afford to zone out. In public settings where you’d rather stay a bit more aware, the transparency mode lets some outside in. You’ll be able to hear when the barista calls your name, hold quick conversations with a polite thank you and please, plus stay alert to traffic.</p>
<p>High-fidelity output is supported via USB-C, while a Theatre-like, 3D sound is made possible with spatial audio. The latter places the sound all around you, making it feel like you’re surrounded by 64 speakers at once. Switching between both modes and managing music couldn’t be easier. Multi-function on-ear controls let you do all that with just a few taps; no need to pull your phone out.</p>
<p>Battery life is another strong selling point. A single charge lets you vibe to your favorite songs for up to 40 hours in one go. No sweat when you’re running low, either. Plug these in for 10 minutes and enjoy up to 4 additional hours of jamming. Beats Studio Pro work well with both iOS and Android devices, so compatibility won’t be an issue, as well. The box comes with the headphones, a woven carrying case, a 3.5mm audio cable, a universal USB-C charging cable, a quick Start Guide, and a warranty Card. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5945/">This deal takes a whopping $200 off the usual price of the Beats Studio Pro, placing them in a much more affordable range. Get yours fast, and discounts on this massive tend to expire quickly.</a></p>
