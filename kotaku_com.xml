              <p>Controllers can make or break your gaming experience. After all, you rely on these gadgets to find your way around in digital worlds, fight battles, explore, and more. If you’re experiencing persistent stick drift, poor connectivity, and unresponsiveness from your current option, it’s time for an upgrade.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6462/">Right now, you can grab the latest Xbox wireless gaming controller in carbon black at a sweet 25% discount for $49.</a> Several other options are discounted too, but the prices may vary. For instance, the stunning Heart Breaker version with vibrant patterns is sitting at $59, while the Shock Blue option is going for $52.</p>

<h2>Gives You a Competitive Edge</h2>
<p>The controller features a modern design with sculpted surfaces and refined geometry for enhanced comfort during gameplay. Textured grips on the triggers, bumpers, and back case make it easy to lock onto targets and stay on them, while the new hybrid D-pad offers incredibly accurate yet familiar input that gives you a competitive edge. Additionally, if the standard layout doesn’t quite work for you, or you simply want more control over the way you play, you can also customize button mappings with the Xbox Accessories app. It lets you tweak controls according to your playstyle, offering accessibility and increased comfort, which can eventually lead to better performance.</p>
<p>Those who like to show cool in-game moves and strategies off will appreciate the new Share button, too. With this, you can take screenshots and record with just a single click. There’s a 3.5mm audio headset jack to connect headphones for easier communication, as well.</p>



<p>Compatibility-wise, the controller plays nicely with Windows, Android, iOS, Fire TV Sticks, Smart TVs, and VR Headsets. You have the option to plug in directly via the USB-C port for a quick setup, or go wireless using Bluetooth for cable-free gaming across all your favorite devices. Maybe use it with your console for gaming on the go, and switch to a bigger screen when you want to enjoy a more immersive gaming experience, especially with friends.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6462/">The console is now down to just $49, after Amazon knocked a nice $16 off its retail price.</a> Several colors are going for less, so there are options to choose from. You can pick the one that best fits your gaming aesthetics. It’s important to note that the discount is only around for a short time. We’re not expecting it to last more than a day, so it’s best to grab it as soon as you can. Once it’s gone, we can’t guarantee that the controller will be this affordable again.</p>
