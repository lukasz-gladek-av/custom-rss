            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>A YouTuber reportedly discovered a way to generate infinite money via a strange trade-in deal glitch at GameStop. After making a video about it, the company figured out what was going on and has now claimed to have “patched” the bug. Or maybe this is all some odd marketing stunt. Or somehow both things are true. It’s hard to say anymore.</p> <p>On January 20, video game retailer, <a href="https://kotaku.com/gamestop-bitcoin-half-a-billion-500-million-meme-stock-1851782733">Bitcoin investor</a>, and Funko Pop graveyard <a href="https://x.com/gamestop/status/2013691078109733056">GameStop posted a lengthy comment</a> to Twitter about a so-called “Infinite Money Glitch” that was recently discovered by <a href="https://youtu.be/6GEgSUUJ758">YouTube content creator RJCmedia</a>. How the glitch worked, apparently, was that if you bought a Nintendo Switch 2 for $415 and then immediately traded it back in along with the purchase of any pre-owned game, a promo would be triggered that increased the value of the trade-in to $472. Repeat this a few times, and you could rack up a few hundred bucks in trade-in credit.</p>

 <p>Here’s why this glitch happened and how it worked, according to GameStop:</p> <p>“In short, our system briefly valued the pre-owned trade more than the new retail cost of the console itself, creating a narrow window where customers could repeat this transaction over and over again to amass infinite trade credit,” said GameStop on social media.</p>  <h2>GameStop’s response to the infinite money glitch</h2> <p>GameStop says that “effective immediately, the glitch has been patched.” It further added that “trade promotions have been updated to ensure customers can no longer convert basic arithmetic into an endless revenue stream, and balance has been restored.”</p>

 <p>GameStop, a company that has become famous for memes, shitposting, spinning dumb mistakes into marketing material, and also for reportedly treating its employees poorly, ended its lengthy statement by reminding people that it remains “committed to offering promotions that reward” its customers. However, it “gently” reminded people that its stores are “not designed to function as infinite money printers.”</p>

 <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">GAMESTOP ISSUES STATEMENT ON INFINITE MONEY GLITCH</p> <p>GameStop is aware of the “GameStop Infinite Money Glitch,” exposed by YouTuber RJCmedia. </p> <p>By purchasing a Nintendo Switch 2 for $414.99 and then immediately trading it back in along with the purchase of a pre-owned game, a… <a href="https://t.co/F2D2v41IeQ">pic.twitter.com/F2D2v41IeQ</a></p> <p>— GameStop (@gamestop) <a href="https://twitter.com/gamestop/status/2013691078109733056?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 20, 2026</a></p></blockquote>  <p>So now the big question: Is this real? The video from RJCmedia seems real enough, with the creator visiting different stores and filming the process of trading in each console. There is also a bit where he is surprised to see a GameStop store closing soon and isn’t able to pull off the trade glitch there. Alluding to the news that many GameStop stores will be shutting down due to greed would likely be something the company wouldn’t want in a piece of viral marketing. There’s also nothing in the video disclosing it as a paid ad, and the creator isn’t massive, so it doesn’t seem like a person the company would partner with to do some weird guerrilla marketing. If it seems odd that I’m spending this much time dissecting whether or not this is real, it’s because <a href="https://kotaku.com/gamestop-s-stock-price-soars-to-new-records-because-cap-1846113214">GameStop is a very weird</a> <a href="https://kotaku.com/gamestop-xbox-360-digital-marketplace-physical-discs-1851609043">company these days</a>, <a href="https://kotaku.com/gamestops-concept-stores-of-the-future-are-very-sad-1841917148">and you</a> <a href="https://kotaku.com/gamestop-gme-bitcoin-meme-stock-close-stores-1851772455">gotta be careful out there</a>.</p> <p>Anyway, I think this is all real, though the statement from GameStop is clearly trying to make this a fun situation, <a href="https://kotaku.com/switch-2-box-staples-gamestop-replacement-launch-1851783684">which reminds me of the stapler incident from last year.</a> I hope others out there got to take advantage of this strange bug. Power to the players and all that, you know?</p>

              <p><span>Rare </span><i><span>Pokémon </span></i><span>cards are locked up in one of the most secure locations in the United States. The Surging Sparks Pikachu, which includes a full art illustration of the little yellow guy adorned in a Stellar-type Tera crown, is sitting in a Lucky Box vending machine in the Pentagon food court. Good luck getting into that, </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-card-shops-robbed-100k-nyc-masked-thieves-anime-backpacks-recently-opened-2000660233"><span>card robbers</span></a><span>.</span></p> <p><a href="https://www.404media.co/theres-a-lootbox-with-rare-pokemon-cards-sitting-in-the-pentagon-food-court/?ref=aftermath.site"><i><span>404 Media</span></i></a><span> reports that the Lucky Box vending machine, which is essentially a gacha machine for rare, graded cards of both the sports and trading card game variety, was seemingly put up in the United States’ military headquarters </span><a href="https://taskandpurpose.com/news/pentagon-lucky-box/?ref=404media.co"><span>around Christmas Eve last month</span></a><span>.&nbsp;</span></p>

   <figure id="attachment_2000661404" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000661404"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000661404">© The Pokémon Company</figcaption></figure> <p><span>In a now-deleted Threads announcement, Lucky Box posted that it had set up one of its loot box machines in the Pentagon food court, and&nbsp; among the potential prizes which the machine’s display touts could be yours if you blindly give it some cash is the aforementioned Pikachu card. Based on photos posted on the </span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/army/comments/1qbc0du/comment/nz9gcjz/?ref=404media.co"><span>Army subreddit</span></a><span>, the machine also has an image of a giant Charizard card on the side of it, but it’s unclear if that’s just decoration or if the original fire-breathing dragon card is also in that specific machine. Taking your chances at a Luck Box machine can cost anywhere from $100 to $200.</span></p> <p><span>Lucky Box’s </span><a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/DSf3_KvCWta/"><span>social media accounts</span></a><span> include photos of big winners, some of whom won rare </span><i><span>Pokémon </span></i><span>cards, while others won autographed jerseys from various sports teams. But it doesn’t look like they’ve posted anyone scoring something big in the middle of the Pentagon yet. In fact, most of its posts feature the boxes in Las Vegas, where </span><a href="https://luckyboxvending.com/pages/store-locator"><span>over 20 of the machines are found</span></a><span>. The winners that are featured are finding some pretty valuable </span><i><span>Pokémon </span></i><span>cards, though, from a rare Venusaur to the ancient Mew promo card from </span><i><span>Pokémon: The First Movie</span></i><span>’s theatrical run.</span></p>   <p><i><span>Pokémon </span></i><span>cards are already pretty much considered gambling by people who crack packs open by the dozens in the hopes of scoring a quick buck, but it’s still striking to see that concept&nbsp; demonstrated as blatantly as it is here, with valuable cards locked away in a machine that requires people to shell out hundreds of dollars for a small chance of scoring one.. Thank goodness the most powerful military in the world is keeping its eye on the machine until the lucky winner comes along. </span></p>

              <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/console-wars-are-over-ps5-xbox-forza-switch-2-sony-1851752956">The console wars ended a while ago</a>, in case you didn’t know. But if they were still raging on, a talented hardware modder in China created a device that would force a lasting peace. It’s a massive and very cleverly designed triangular box that contains an Xbox, PlayStation, and Switch 2. They all work and can be easily swapped between with the press of a button.</p> <p><a href="https://www.tomshardware.com/video-games/console-gaming/modder-builds-all-in-one-console-with-ps5-xbox-series-x-and-switch-2-in-a-single-system-ningtendo-pxbox-5-powered-by-a-shared-250w-power-supply-mounted-inside-a-lost-wax-chassis">As first spotted by <em>Tom’s Hardware</em>,</a> Chinese tech and computer expert <em>小宁子 XNZ&nbsp;</em><a href="https://youtu.be/FAIqzpbv9Xw">has created an all-in-one mega console</a> which she anointed the “Ningtendo PXBOX 5,” a name that just rolls right off the tongue. According to XNZ, the idea behind this wild device came from her wanting to play various console-exclusive games without having to get up and manually power on and off each machine to switch between them.</p>

  <p>The design of the monster machine is inspired by the <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/112025">2013 Apple Mac Pro, aka the one that looked like a trash can</a>. And while she didn’t use the actual innards of an old Mac, the inside of that strange computer was a triangular setup that ended up being the perfect design to house three disassembled gaming consoles. A fan at the bottom is then used to cool the consoles.</p> <p>But creating a triangular heatsink for that would be expensive, so XNZ used an ancient method known as lost-wax casting to create the high-end piece of tech. Essentially, you first create an object out of an easy-to-melt piece of material, like wax or plastic, and then coat it in a heat-resistant material. Then you heat the object and all the soft insides melt and you can pour molten metal inside, which hardens and cools into your desired shape. Nifty!</p>

 <p>The end product is an impressive device but it might not be the most practical. The power supply she used only allows one console at a time to play a game, though the others can idle in the background. A big button on top switches the HDMI input between the consoles. Probably easier and cheaper to just buy the consoles and an HDMI switcher with a remote, but that’s not nearly as cool as the Ningtendo PXBOX 5.</p>
