              <p>Activision has officially announced its plans to make a <em>Call of Duty</em> movie. It will be written and directed by<em> Friday Night Lights</em> creator Peter Berg with some writing help from <em>Yellowstone’s</em> creator Taylor Sheridan. No release date was shared.</p> <p>On October 30, <a href="https://deadline.com/2025/10/taylor-sheridan-peter-berg-call-of-duty-movie-1236602997/">following an initial report from <em>Deadline</em></a>, Paramount and Activision confirmed that after signing a deal in <a href="https://kotaku.com/call-of-duty-movie-paramount-activision-2000622362">September to work together</a> on a future <em>Call of Duty</em> movie, the companies have settled on a director for the live-action war movie based on the popular first-person shooter franchise. Peter Berg is directing, writing, and producing the <em>Call of Duty</em> movie through his studio Film 47. Berg’s past work includes films like <i>Lone Survivor</i>,&nbsp;<i>Deepwater Horizon</i>, and&nbsp;<i>Patriots Day.&nbsp;</i>Taylor Sheridan is co-writing the movie and will help produce it. In recent years, Sheridan has become one of the biggest names in TV, creating shows like <em>Yellowstone</em>, <em>Mayor of Kingstown</em>, and <em>Tulsa King</em> for Paramount’s streaming platform.</p>

 <p>No plot details were shared in a press release announcing the<em> Call of Duty</em> movie’s director and writers, but Paramount did claim that the live-action film will be “designed to thrill its massive global fan base by delivering on the hallmarks of what fans love about the iconic series, while boldly expanding the franchise to entirely new audiences.” In other words, Paramount claims its new <em>Call of Duty</em> movie will be good and everyone will love it.</p> <p>Paramount likely sees Berg as a perfect fit for this project, as he has a history of making gritty action and war movies. And teaming him up with Sheridan makes sense as the two are friends in real life and have worked together before on movies like <em>Hell or High Water.&nbsp;</em>No casting announcements were made by Paramount, but considering Berg has used Mark Wahlberg in five different movies, it seems at least quite possible that the actor (who previously portrayed Max Payne) will be involved in the upcoming <em>Call of Duty</em> movie. Well, assuming it gets made. Activision has been trying and failing for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Call_of_Duty#Films">a decade now to make a <em>CoD</em> movie</a>. But maybe this time…</p>

              <p>For the last month, I’ve been playing around with <a href="https://kotaku.com/hyperkin-x91-retro-controller-review-past-imperfect-1793539025">Hyperkin</a>‘s new Competitor controller. This wired gamepad is an officially licensed Xbox controller that is designed to look and feel like a PlayStation 5 controller. And it’s a great controller, but holy crap does it break my brain when I use it.</p> <p>Out now, <a href="https://kotaku.com/xbox-controller-ps5-hyperkin-competitor-dualsense-price-1851733419">Hyperkin’s new Competitor controller costs $50</a> and is a damn fine gamepad. It features super-smooth and responsive Hall Effect joysticks, so stick drift shouldn’t be a problem anytime soon, and it has Xbox-like Impulse Triggers that rumble as you’d expect. This wired controller is incredibly well built and feels great to use. Heck, it feels really good just to hold. It’s the kind of gamepad that makes you want to play something when you pick it up. Buttons are responsive, too, though I’m not a huge fan of the menu and view buttons. They’re too slim in profile and can be easy to miss when first using the controller and blindly sliding your thumbs around.</p>

 <p>The Competitor sports some extras that a standard Xbox gamepad lacks, like two back buttons located on the rear of the gamepad’s long, textured grips. These can be programmed in supporting games, letting you assign reload or jump or other actions to these extra inputs. The back buttons can also be locked so you don’t accidentally use them, a feature I appreciate as I don’t normally engage with back paddles.</p>

 <p>The big difference between this and most other Xbox controllers is that it’s built to feel like a PS5 DualSense. The sticks are symmetrical, the d-pad feels ripped right off a Dualsense, and even the shape is a close-to-perfect match for Sony’s controller. If you’re someone who is more comfortable using a PlayStation controller, but you also own an Xbox Series X/S, the Competitor is designed specifically for you.</p>

 <h2>Plays great, feels weird</h2> <figure id="attachment_2000640206" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000640206"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000640206"><em>The Hyperkin Competitor (black and white) next to my PS5 gamepad (black) and my trippy-looking Xbox controller.</em> ©Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p>Overall, this is a fantastic controller that worked perfectly on my PC as well as my Xbox Series X. But actually using this controller to play games broke my brain. I didn’t realize until I started playing around with the Competitor how hardwired my brain is when it comes to controllers.</p>

 <p>Holding this thing, my brain wants to treat it like a PlayStation controller, yet the Xbox button prompts don’t match up with what my brain <em>thinks</em> I’m holding. I’d go to press the DualSense’s touchpad to open a menu and find nothing but barren plastic. It was like rubbing my stomach while tapping my head with a different hand. I could use the Competitor, but only if I thought about it, and even then, I’d make mistakes.</p> <p>I imagine for folks who prefer PlayStation controllers, this won’t be a problem. They’ll plug this into their Xbox and never look back. But as someone who hops between Xbox and PlayStation a lot, this controller really screwed with me. That’s not the controller’s fault. That’s my brain being weird. For most people, this won’t be a problem. And for $50, the Competitor is a solid, well-made Xbox or PC controller that will likely last you years if you take care of it.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/ecoflow-drops-black-friday-deals-1800w-delta-3-now-cheaper-than-budget-gas-generators.1339582/</guid>

              <p>Winter power outages seem to pick the worst times to strike, such as during holiday gatherings of friends or when you are hosting game night in your living room. Portable power stations solve this anxiety by keeping your most-used devices running when the grid goes down, and EcoFlow has launched its Black Friday deals with aggressive pricing that makes premium backup power surprisingly affordable.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5131/">EcoFlow Delta 3 Classic has been cut from $599 down to just $399</a>, which undercuts even budget gas generators while d<strong>elivering 1800 watts of clean, silent power without fumes or maintenance headaches</strong>.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5131/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Real Electric Power</h2>
<p>The <strong>continuous 1800-watt output</strong> is ready to power refrigerators, microwaves, laptops and space heaters and do that for several devices at the same time in case of outages. That <strong>3600-watt surge capacity handles the surge in power</strong> that happens when things like refrigerator compressors kick in to prevent tripping or shutdowns when your refrigerator compressor comes on. It offer <strong>two USB-C ports (100W and 30W), one USB-C port and three AC outputs</strong>.</p>



<p>The 1024 Wh LiFePO4 battery offers ample capacity to <strong>run a typical refrigerator for around 12 to 15 hours</strong> and keep your food from spoiling during extended blackouts. This automotive-grade battery chemistry offers superior safety and longevity, compared to standard lithium-ion cells, retaining more than 80% of its original capacity even after 4000 complete charge cycles. That’s <strong>more than 10 years of use daily</strong> which makes this a lifetime investment rather than a disposable emergency tool.</p>
<p>X-Stream Fast Charging Technology provides <strong>charging from completely dead to 80% capacity in as little as 45 minutes</strong> with a standard wall outlet. That kind of speed is critical when weather forecasts predict an incoming storm and you have forgotten to keep your battery topped up. The system intelligently identifies the optimal voltage and current to maximize charging speed, and avoids battery degradation that many cheaper units with aggressive charging profiles suffer from.</p>



<p>A <strong>UPS switching time of less than 10 milliseconds safeguards desktop computers, servers, NAS systems</strong> and medical equipment against power interruptions. This near-instant transition happens so fast that most electronics won’t be able to detect the changeover, thus preventing data loss, system crashes or disrupted medical treatments. The pure sine wave output provides grid-quality power, just like what’s coming out of your wall outlets, to ensure sensitive electronics get clean electricity free of voltage fluctuations that can burn out circuit boards.</p>
<p>The cell-to-chassis construction design shields the battery from drops, bumps, and transport vibrations that would destroy loosely mounted cells. This automotive-inspired structural approach insulates the battery cells from external impacts, improving thermal management by direct contact with the chassis. The unit operates reliably in temperatures from freezing cold to scorching heat, handles 95% humidity levels and resists 5% salt spray which makes it perfect for coastal areas and harsh environments where cheaper power stations just don’t cut it.</p>
<p>At $399 instead of $599, this Black Friday deal undercuts the price of budget gas generators and delivers superior convenience, safety, and long-term value in return.</p>
