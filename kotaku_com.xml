              <p><span>There’s a moment in </span><i><span>Routine</span></i><span>, a new sci-fi horror game launching on Xbox and PC on December 4, that I won’t forget for a long time.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>To explain this moment and why it is burned into my brain would involve spoilers, but suffice it to say, in a game that rarely relies on jump scares, this moment</span> <span>was so perfectly crafted that it caught me completely off guard. So much so that I found my hands shaking a bit. And with no pause button, all I could do in the game was slide into a corner of the room and try to collect myself. So yeah, if you don’t like scary games, </span><i><span>Routine </span></i><span>ain’t for you.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><i><span>Routine </span></i><span>is a spooky first-person horror game set in an alternate future where humanity made it to the Moon and partially colonized it sometime in the 1980s. This means a lot of the technology you’ll encounter during </span><i><span>Routine’s </span></i><span>six to seven-hour story feels dated, mechanical, and retro. Old CRTs and ’80s-era computers are everywhere, offering up some</span><i><span> Alien Isolation </span></i><span>vibes, which I didn’t mind at all.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <h2><b>Buttons and doodads and switches</b></h2> <p><span>This retro sci-fi aesthetic includes your trusty Cosmonaut Assistance Tool or CAT, which you acquire right at the start of the game as your character arrives at the now-abandoned moonbase to make repairs.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>Part computer, part camera, and part gun, the CAT features switches and modes that must be activated by fumbling around with it. It’s designed to be a clunky way to save your game, unlock doors, and scan equipment. And it makes even something as simple as swapping to a different mode a scary moment where you have to stop looking around and focus on your CAT to find the right switch. It’s one of many ways </span><i><span>Routine </span></i><span>uses clunky mechanics to add tension.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <figure id="attachment_2000649247" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000649247"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000649247">©Lunar Software</figcaption></figure> <p><i><span>Routine </span></i><span>also hides items and pieces of information in hard-to-reach spots, forcing you to stretch up or bend down using a few extra buttons. Like operating the CAT, this isn’t hard to do, but it does become far trickier to interact with this world using these deliberately clunky methods when a killer robot is quickly approaching.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><span>And yeah, as you might have guessed, you aren’t alone on the moon. Pretty quickly after arriving, killer robots become a problem. They dot the hallways and rooms of the deteriorating moonbase, just waiting to spot you and take chase. And while you can stun them with your CAT, it’s a brief delay and not a viable strategy for survival. Stealth is much more effective, though panic-running to the game’s few safe areas also works, too. Don’t ask me how I know.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <h2><b>Expect the unexpected</b></h2> <p><span>The thing is, there’s… more to </span><i><span>Routine </span></i><span>beyond what I’ve already mentioned. Obstensibly, as seen in all the pre-release gameplay footage of </span><i><span>Routine</span></i><span>, this is a creepy sci-fi game built around trying to repair a moonbase that features once-docile robots who are now deadly machines determined to find you and snap your neck. That’s not all </span><i><span>Routine </span></i><span>is, but to spoil any more would be a crime. Just know that the second half of this game ratchets up the horror and goes in a direction I wasn’t expecting.</span></p> <div>           <ul>                           <li>                 <p>Back-of-the-box quote:</p>                 <p>“Moon’s haunted.” </p>               </li>                                         <li>                 <p>Developer:</p>                 <p>Lunar Software</p>               </li>                                         <li>                 <p>Type of game:</p>                 <p>Photorealistic first-person sci-fi survival game</p>               </li>                                         <li>                 <p>Liked:</p>                 <p>Gorgeous graphics, creepy vibes, mechanical controls, wonderful second-half swerve  </p>               </li>                               </ul><ul>                                         <li>                 <p>Disliked:</p>                 <p>Some annoying puzzles, ending is a bit meh</p>               </li>                                         <li>                 <p>Platforms:</p>                 <p>Xbox Series X/S (played), Xbox One, PC</p>               </li>                                         <li>                 <p>Played:</p>                 <p>Finished the game’s story in about 6 hours. </p>               </li>                                     </ul>         </div>  <p><span>I appreciated the swerve that occurs in </span><i><span>Routine’s </span></i><span>second half. Up until that point, I found </span><i><span>Routine </span></i><span>to be a solid </span><i><span>Alien Isolatio</span></i><span>n-like experience, but nothing too remarkable. But by the end, after it zigs and zags, </span><i><span>Routine </span></i><span>had fully escaped </span><i><span>Isolation’s </span></i><span>shadow, becoming its own worthwhile horror game and scared the shit out of me in the process.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><span>And while I can’t say much about the second half, I can gush about </span><i><span>Routine’s </span></i><span>visuals. This is one of the best-looking video games I’ve played this console generation.&nbsp;</span></p> <h2><b>Looks that kill, puzzles that annoy</b></h2> <p><span>At times, the derelict environments of </span><i><span>Routine </span></i><span>look photorealistic. Lighting and texture detail, in particular, are astonishing. At one point, I was hiding and shaking behind a large piece of machinery and spotted a detailed warning label with scratch marks. It almost distracted me from how scared I was at that moment. Almost. What actually ruined the creepy vibes were some of </span><i><span>Routine’s </span></i><span>annoying puzzles.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><span>Unfortunately, some of these threw me for a loop and led to a lot of random backtracking. The game’s total lack of UI is an immersive choice, but it did lead to some moments where I ran into a brick wall and struggled to move forward. If you play </span><i><span>Routine</span></i><span>, don’t feel bad if you have to look up a few puzzle solutions. Many of these just get in the way of a truly scary experience.&nbsp;</span></p> <figure id="attachment_2000649245" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000649245"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000649245">©Lunar Software</figcaption></figure> <p><span>At least I got to backtrack through some haunting photorealistic environments. These spaces and mundane objects in them provide a perfect backdrop for<em> Routine’s</em> horrific elements. It is genuinely unnerving to be in a hyper-realistic kitchen and turn around to spot an evil robot just a few feet away. And </span><i><span>Routine </span></i><span>loves to use its environments, which are filled with wonderful sound design as well, to build up tension and dread.&nbsp;</span><span>There were times when the simple act of moving from one doorway to another felt like the scariest thing I’ve done in a video game. I might not have even been in danger, but I was shook.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><i><span>Routine </span></i><span>was announced over a decade ago at this point. So was it worth the wait? Hard to say, as I wasn’t waiting for it, but I can confirm that a decade after it was first revealed, </span><i><span>Routine </span></i><span>is a damn fine horror game that stands toe to toe with other heavy hitters of the genre.&nbsp;</span></p>

            <guid>1370263</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><span>We know Hideo Kojima, the creative lead behind </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/death-stranding-2-review-is-it-good-ps5-playstation-5-1851784852"><i><span>Death Stranding</span></i></a> <span>and </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/metal-gear-solid-snake-eater-delta-remake-2000619269"><i><span>Metal Gear Solid</span></i></a><span>, loves movies. The guy even says in his Twitter bio that “70% of [his] body is made of movies.” However, Kojima doesn’t often get to play characters in movies. He’s only had a handful of acting credits over the years. But he’s <a href="https://x.com/thegameawards/status/1995746201720029486?s=20">adding one more to his filmography this year</a>: he’ll be playing a character in the Japanese dub of </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/zootopia-2-nick-judy-relationship-romance-abortion-comic-2000649147"><i><span>Zootopia 2</span></i></a><span>.</span></p> <p><span>Paul Molebrandt only has a few lines in Disney’s sequel, but the IT guy in the Zootopia Police Department office does pave the way for some pretty good scenes. </span><i><span>Zootopia</span></i><span>, its sequel, and the </span><i><span>Zootopia+ </span></i><span>mini-series play around a lot with the titular city’s shared space between multiple, differently-sized animals.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <figure id="attachment_2000649594" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000649594"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000649594">© Disney</figcaption></figure> <p><span>As a mole, Paul is much smaller than most of Zootopia 2’s main cast, and his few scenes really play around with that juxtaposition, so even when he’s not speaking, he’s giving the movie a lot of humorous space to work in. Kojima may not say much in the movie, but his character makes an impact in just a few short scenes. The role began with Josh Gad in the English original, who is best known in the Disney space for playing </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/frozen-olaf-character-roams-disney-parks-2026-2000647055"><span>Olaf in the </span><i><span>Frozen </span></i><span>series</span></a><span>.</span></p> <p><i><span>Zootopia 2 </span></i><span>is out here in the States, but the Japanese dub will enter theaters overseas on Friday, December 5. The sequel has already been a smash hit for Disney, having already passed half a billion at the box office in just one week, and the post-credits scene has big implications for a potential third movie that will probably come out sometime in the 2030s. So, hey, Kojima might reprise the role of Paul in the inevitable </span><i><span>Zootopia 3 </span></i><span>Japanese dub. Surely we’ll have </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/hideo-kojima-od-trailer-horror-2000627883"><i><span>OD</span></i></a> <span>and </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/physint-kojima-metal-gear-ps6-release-date-od-1851781247"><i><span>Physint</span></i></a><span> by then, right?</span></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>December is here and both Black Friday and Cyber Monday are in the rearview mirror. If you missed your shot at purchasing some holiday gifts during the biggest sales event of the year, you’re not out of luck just yet. Some deals are still active and attractive for late shoppers like us. One such deal is on the Samsung Galaxy Buds 3 Pro, the true wireless Bluetooth earbuds. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4335/">Normally priced at $250, these earbuds are currently available for just $140—a whole $110 in savings, thanks to a 44% discount.</a></p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4335/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Ultimate Comfort and Fit</h2>
<p>Samsung’s Galaxy Buds 3 Pro are designed to be the most comfortable in-ear headphones the brand has created yet, ideal for all-day wear.

This thoughtful design ensures the earbuds stay in place, delivering crisp, clear sound every time you use them. Whether you’re running errands, working out, or just relaxing, these earbuds should stay securely in your ears.</p>
<h2>Advanced Noise Cancellation and Custom Sound</h2>
<p>With ANC support the Samsung Galaxy Buds Pro 3 can automatically adjust the level of noise cancellation based on your environment.

It’s a sci-fi wonder straight out of The <em>Hitchhiker’s Guide to the Galaxy. </em>When someone says “Hola” to you, the earbuds instantly translate it to “Hello” in your ear. This makes communicating while traveling a breeze. It does require being paired with a Samsung device to function. Sorry iPhone users.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/nintendo-switch-oled-with-joy-con-falls-to-a-clearance-level-low-as-amazon-has-only-limited-grade-a-renewed-units-left-2000649255</link>
            <guid>1370173</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Nintendo recently launched the much-anticipated successor to its highly successful Nintendo Switch console earlier this summer. For those looking to upgrade, the new Nintendo Switch 2 is available this holiday season for $450. However, if you missed out on the original Switch, or if you’re not in a rush to adopt the latest version, picking up a previous model could be a smart choice. Currently, Amazon is offering a refurbished model of the Nintendo Switch OLED at a massive discount. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6171/">Going refurbished over new, normally will save you about $40 ($360 versus $400). However, right now for Cyber Week, the price has come down to just $310</a>. You end up saving $75 wen compared to buying the Switch OLED new, and you can join the Nintendo ecosystem for $171 less than you’d pay buying a brand new Nintendo Switch 2.</p>
<p>While the Nintendo Switch debuted way back in 2017, Nintendo did release updated hardware between then and now with the Nintendo Switch OLED arriving in 2021. This mid-generation upgrade brought substantial improvements over the original version. The most notable change is the 7-inch OLED screen, which delivers brighter, more vivid visuals, especially noticeable in games with prevalent deep blacks like <em>Metroid Dread</em>—a title that launched alongside the OLED model.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6171/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>OLED vs. Switch 2</h2>
<p>Interestingly, the new Switch 2 doesn’t feature an OLED display. Instead, it uses an LCD screen with HDR, which represents an improvement over the standard LCD technology on the launch model Switch but still can’t match the color richness and depth of OLED. This decision seems to be a cost-saving measure by Nintendo, and they likely aim to release a Switch 2 with an OLED screen in the future. As it stands now, certain games actually look better on the OLED model compared to the Switch 2 due to the superior display.</p>
<p>When it comes to battery life, the Nintendo Switch OLED still holds an advantage. The Switch 2 offers between 2 to 6.5 hours of battery life depending on the intensity of the games you play. In contrast, the Switch OLED lasts anywhere between 4.5 to 9 hours, providing a more reliable portable gaming experience. Though the Switch 2 comes with a larger 5220mAh battery (compared to the Switch OLED’s 4310mAh), the bigger screen and higher resolution (1080p handheld) cause the Switch 2 to drain its battery more quickly than the OLED model.</p>



<h2>Game Library</h2>
<p>If you’re drawn to the new Nintendo Switch 2 because of its shiny new titles like <em>Donkey Kong: Bananza</em> and <em>Mario Kart World</em>, you’re in for some fun, but beyond those there’s a just a couple new releases that dropped in time for the holiday. All and all, the first-year lineup of games is still somewhat limited. You might find that there’s no immediate need to jump to the newest generation just yet, especially with the vast selection of games already available on the original Switch.</p>
<p>The Nintendo Switch has a well-established library, with fan-favorites like <em>Super Mario Odyssey</em> and <em>The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild</em> still being some of the best titles in gaming. Furthermore, the original Switch is packed with incredible indie games, such as <em>Celeste</em>, <em>Hollow Knight</em>, and<em> Hades</em>, which can each on their own keep your attention for hundreds of hours.</p>
<p>Ultimately, whether the Switch OLED or the Switch 2 is the right choice for you depends on your priorities. If you’re looking for an excellent value and don’t mind going with a model that’s a couple of years old, the Nintendo Switch OLED offers great performance, stunning handheld visuals, and longer battery life. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6171/">You can grab one now for just $310</a>. Then maybe we just hold out for Nintendo to eventually release a Nintendo Switch 2 OLED in a few years.</p>
