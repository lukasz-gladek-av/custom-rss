But that’s not enough penance! We’ve done <em>so much wrong</em>. So here come another 10 indie games that are going under the radar, this Indie-Penance Day.</p><p>Same situation as before: these are the results of a clarion call released on BlueSky, for indies to submit links about their games via email, selected at random, and included below without my having played them. With something like 300 emails coming in now, it feels very unfair that only a minority of submissions can be picked, but it exemplifies the state of indie gaming. So many games, so few outlets willing to take a punt on covering them.</p><p><strong>So I say to all other outlets</strong>, you’d think that articles like these might be something I “get away with” while the <em>Kotaku</em> team is away barbecuing their flags or whatever it is Americans do today, but the reality is: <em>these articles do really good traffic!</em></p><p>There’s cold, capitalist money to be made in indie coverage! Don’t assume it all needs to be teasers for the trailer for the next <em>Call of Duty</em> skin drops—these Indie-Penance posts often end up in <em>Kotaku</em>’s most successful articles for the month.</p><p>Right, lecture over, let’s get on with cooing at really interesting-looking forthcoming indie games!</p></div></div><div><p>This super-pretty game is about helping two characters—Ben and Abi—separately explore a puzzly, platforming world, in both single-player and co-op. What the trailer above doesn’t make clear is that there’s an extra level to it, where you rearrange the world they’re exploring like a sliding tile puzzle, to change how you approach the challenges.</p><p>The one thing I cannot figure out, however, is why this has a “2" in the title! There’s no evidence of a <em>Lost Twins 1</em>, making this incredibly odd. But who cares, when this game from a three-person Pakistani team looks so lovely.</p><p>  <strong>Developer:</strong> Playdew<br><strong>Release Date:</strong> August 2025<br><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://store.steampowered.com/app/1752540/Lost_Twins_2/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1752540/Lost_Twins_2/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Steam Page</a></span> </p></div><div><p>I’m a sucker for a esoteric game name, so <em>Your Holy &amp; Virtuous Heretic</em> draws me right in. That’s then doubled down on when the developer behind it is called ‘i will bite raw coffee beans.’ Fortunately, this super-lo-fi first-person, turn-based RPG looks as weird as its surrounding names. It’s about the occult, magic, technology, and turn-based combat, but combined with free exploration, and I’m just so damned intrigued. There’s a demo if you’re equally curious.</p><p>  <strong>Developer:</strong> i will bite raw coffee beans<br><strong>Release Date:</strong> TBA<br><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://store.steampowered.com/app/2621030/Your_Holy__Virtuous_Heretic/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2621030/Your_Holy__Virtuous_Heretic/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Steam Page</a></span> </p></div><div><p>“Ride a bike into the dark forest,” <em>Vicious Cycle</em> instructs you, as you enter a very spooky-looking first-person puzzle adventure. The game is played in two ways: firstly by riding your bicycle through scary woods, dodging monsters and trying not to be dead; the second exploring on foot, solving puzzles in what look like quite escape-room-inspired ways. Looks like one for people who truly enjoy a good jump-scare. Like me. There’s a demo, too.</p><p>  <strong>Developer:</strong> Brave Traveller Games<br><strong>Release Date:</strong> 2025<br><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://store.steampowered.com/app/3355080/Vicious_Cycle/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3355080/Vicious_Cycle/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Steam Page</a></span> </p></div><div><p>Released just recently, <em>Of Life and Land</em> is a settlement sim that’s proving very popular with the small number of people who’ve picked it up so far. You’re building a small town in the middle of the countryside, with nature playing a key role in the game. As you grow your settlement, you’ll start to have an increased effect on the wildlife around you, possibly causing some to become endangered or extinct, or even accidentally triggering over-population. It seems the game leaves you free to decide how you want to handle your impact, while also worrying about economies, resources and citizens’ needs.</p><p><strong>Developer:</strong> Kerzoven<br><strong>Release Date:</strong> Out Now<br><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://store.steampowered.com/app/1733110/Of_Life_and_Land/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1733110/Of_Life_and_Land/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Steam Page</a></span></p></div><div><p>I often wonder at the name choices people make for games, given how hard they can be to remember how to spell or Google, but I think <em>Drăculești</em> might take the biscuit. I don’t even know how to make my keyboard do that smiley a, or tailed s. However, if anyone can find it again, this is a romantic horror visual novel, based around the Dracula myth. And yes, you can totes get down with ol’ Drac himself. There’s going to be <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1712125696/draculesti&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1712125696/draculesti" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">a Kickstarter</a></span> next week, to get the game across the finish line, but there’s already a demo available.</p><p>  <strong>Developer:</strong> Fine Feathered Friends<br><strong>Release Date:</strong> TBA<br><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://store.steampowered.com/app/2537980/Drculeti/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2537980/Drculeti/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Steam Page</a></span> </p></div><div><p>Right at the other end of the dating game market is <em>Heartspell: Horizon Academy</em>. It’s hooking up via the magic of match-3!</p><p>I’ve recently been dragged back into playing the fantastic <em>Gems of War</em> by my 10-year-old, who is totally hooked, and as great as that game is, you never get to smooch the monsters. Thank goodness, given the 10yo is playing. He definitely won’t be playing this, which looks like a fantastic mix of visual novel and <em>Puzzle Quest</em>-like match-3 puzzles, where you level up your magical abilities and make kissy-face at the local wizards. There’s a demo out which apparently has a full 90 minutes of game!</p><p><strong>Developer:</strong> Dire Kitten Games<br><strong>Release Date:</strong> 2025<br><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://store.steampowered.com/app/2113350/Heartspell_Horizon_Academy/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2113350/Heartspell_Horizon_Academy/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Steam Page</a></span></p></div><div><p>I know, it looks like I’m going through the hundreds of emails and just picking out the puns. I swear that’s not what’s happening. (Which implies something far worse is happening—a pun epidemic in game titling.) But come on, <em>Omelet You Cook</em>. God, that’s good/bad.</p><p>It looks completely mad. A cooking roguelite, with a <em>Dave the Diver</em> aesthetic, where you have to make omelets (look, I know it’s Independence Day and all, but it’s “omelette,” Americans. It’s a French word!) for a student cafeteria. You know, omelets with donuts and pineapples. It came out in early access in the last month, for only $8, and there’s a demo as well.</p><p>  <strong>Developer:</strong> Dan Schumacher, Hjalte Tagmose<br><strong>Release Date:</strong> Out Now<br><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://store.steampowered.com/app/3205380/Omelet_You_Cook/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3205380/Omelet_You_Cook/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Steam Page</a></span> </p></div><div><p>I’m not sure survival has ever looked so relaxing. <em>Solarpunk</em> (yeah, it’s two words in the art, one word in the text—indie developers...) is about growing food, crafting gadgets, and building buildings, all on floating islands that can be explored via airships. There are ways to build automation for your farming and resource gathering, which seems ideal, since the art makes me want to sit on a deck with my feet up, supping a coffee, as the sun gently sets. Mmmmmmm. There’s a demo to check if it’s as chilled as it appears.</p><p>  <strong>Developer:</strong> Cyberwave<br><strong>Release Date:</strong> 2025<br><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://store.steampowered.com/app/1805110/Solarpunk/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1805110/Solarpunk/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Steam Page</a></span> </p></div><div><p>Developer bilge submitted two unreleased games to this, the other being an excellent Kafkaesque horror based on obeying a pager, called <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://store.steampowered.com/app/2810550/PAGER/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2810550/PAGER/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>Pager</em></a></span>. But I couldn’t take my eye away from <em>Balls, Dice &amp; Stickers</em>, the up-front name for a game about...well, you got there. And that’s most because <em>I have no idea at all what is happening here</em>. And I love it for that. Because there sure is a lot of stuff happening! You’re throwing balls at dice, while using stickers for bonus effects, I think? And it’s a roguelite, and a deckbuilder? Sure. Sure!</p><p><strong>Developer:</strong> bilge<br><strong>Release Date:</strong> 2025<br><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://store.steampowered.com/app/3537690/Balls_Dice__Stickers/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3537690/Balls_Dice__Stickers/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Steam Page</a></span></p></div><div><p><em>Chicken Scratch</em> is a multiplayer drawing game, where your job depends upon being able to convey bizarre prompts through art. But because you’re playing with up to seven people, it’s not so simple. This sounds like a combination of Pictionary and Telephone, as your friends try to interpret, add to or copy your drawing, then others guess the prompt you’d been given. Which sounds gloriously chaotic. Prompts are randomly generated (“Smiling Ice”, “Generous Novelist”, “Enraged Reindeer”), meaning there’s no end to the silliness. There’s a demo out now.</p><p><strong>Developer:</strong> Keely Brown, Mat Belanger<br><strong>Release Date:</strong> TBA<br><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://store.steampowered.com/app/2267230/Chicken_Scratch/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2267230/Chicken_Scratch/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Steam Page</a></span></p><p>.</p></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://kotaku.com/indie-penance-day-indie-games-steam-demo-pc-1851785663]]></content:encoded>

One of them is a buff called Collector’s Bounty which is aimed at transmog collectors and mount farmers. Here’s what you might want to know before you jump in.</p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="197589" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="Ring Psychology: Understanding The 6 Phases Of A Wrestling Match Through Heel Era John Cena" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="659" data-playlist="197589,197586,197585" data-current="197589"><div><p>Ring Psychology: Understanding The 6 Phases Of A Wrestling Match Through Heel Era John Cena</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197589/197589_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197589/197589_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197589/197589_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/23110.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>There’s been some confusion about how Collector’s Bounty works. It was implemented on July 1 after the weekly reset, but took a couple of hours to kick in. Its effects were initially invisible. Now every character who logs into a modern<em> TWW</em> server will receive Collector’s Bounty on entry into the world.</p><figure id="" data-id="0175704a04499c5cecddec5c8bb0fc00" data-recommend-id="image://0175704a04499c5cecddec5c8bb0fc00" data-format="jpg" data-width="501" data-height="212" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A screenshot shows the Collector's Bounty buff." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A screenshot shows the Collector's Bounty buff." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Blizzard / Thomas Wilde / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="0175704a04499c5cecddec5c8bb0fc00" data-recommend-id="image://0175704a04499c5cecddec5c8bb0fc00" data-format="jpg" data-width="501" data-height="212" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A screenshot shows the Collector's Bounty buff." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>While this buff persists, bosses in every dungeon and raid instance in “legacy content” (any expansion before<em> Dragonflight)</em>, drops double the normal loot. In dungeons, this typically means four to six items, while raid bosses can drop up to 12 depending on the raid’s difficulty setting. Anecdotally, it also seems as if dungeon monsters have a greater chance to drop green- and blue-quality items.</p><figure id="" data-id="042245259078f2262a89a4c38c174884" data-recommend-id="image://042245259078f2262a89a4c38c174884" data-format="jpg" data-width="758" data-height="521" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A screenshot shows loot rewards in WoW." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A screenshot shows loot rewards in WoW." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Blizzard / Thomas Wilde / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="042245259078f2262a89a4c38c174884" data-recommend-id="image://042245259078f2262a89a4c38c174884" data-format="jpg" data-width="758" data-height="521" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A screenshot shows loot rewards in WoW." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>This is a great opportunity to hunt down any transmogrification items you’ve been missing. (Personally, I use the AllTheThings add-on to track my collection, which is why my tooltips are slightly longer than usual).</p><p>Further, several specific items, such as rare mounts and legendary weapons, have a +5 percent chance to drop during Collector’s Bounty. This is 10 times their usual drop rate, and some obsessed players have been trying to get them for actual calendar years. Maybe now’s their chance.</p><figure id="" data-id="13403608ccf3f394a79722fbfd3030b4" data-recommend-id="image://13403608ccf3f394a79722fbfd3030b4" data-format="jpg" data-width="1157" data-height="435"

For example, the Stormwall Blockade encounter in Dazar’lor has an instant kill built into it if you don’t interrupt Catastrophic Tides in time. (If you’re a warlock, make sure your felhunter is out.)</p><p>The entrance to Ny’alotha can appear in either Uldum or the Vale of Eternal Blossoms depending on where the Black Empire is attacking in a given week. You can solo N’Zoth these days without the old <em>BfA</em> legendary cloak, but at current <em>TWW</em> gear levels, you cannot simply burst N’Zoth hard enough to ignore his central mechanics. You’ll need to enter his Mindgates and reclaim your Severed Consciousness or you’ll simply drop dead.</p><hr><h2 id="h183933"><a id=""></a><strong>Shadowlands</strong></h2><ul data-type="List" data-style="Bullet"><li><strong>Marrowfang’s Reins</strong>, Nalthor the Rimebinder, mythic Necrotic Wake</li><li><strong>Cartel Master’s Gearglider</strong>, So’leah, Tazavesh</li><li><strong>Sanctum Gloomcharger’s Reins</strong>, The Nine, Sanctum of Domination</li><li><strong>Vengeance’s Reins</strong>, Sylvanas Windrunner, mythic Sanctum of Domination</li><li><strong>Fractal Cypher of the Zereth Overseer</strong>, The Jailer, mythic Sepulcher of the First Ones</li></ul><p>While there are a couple of ways to reach various parts of the Shadowlands without having to go through its introductory sequence, you’ll typically end up out of phase with most of the features and characters. To get into places like the Maw or Zereth Mortis on a new character, you’ll need to start their introductory quests by talking to the Knights of Ebon Blade in either Stormwind or Orgrimmar.</p><p>Like BfA, there are a few different bosses in <em>Shadowlands </em>with instant-kill gimmicks, particularly in mythic raids. While none of them have the firepower to really bother a level 80 character, given the stat inflation between this expansion and <em>TWW</em>, a few have abilities that can seriously ruin a solo raider’s day. Particular offenders here include the Jailer’s mind control, Soulrender Dormazain’s Warmonger Shackles, and Artificer Xy’mox’s Stasis Traps. Keep an eye on your dungeon journal.</p><p>At time of writing, So’leah is also difficult to beat solo, as her dungeon gimmick gives her a massive damage reduction bonus that you can’t dispel without a team. You can either autoattack her for 10 minutes, bring friends, or use a level 80 monk’s Touch of Death to bypass her shields and drop her in one hit.</p><p>Collector’s Bounty in <em>World of Warcraft</em> is currently planned to last until July 28.</p><p>.  </p></div></div><br/><br/>https://kotaku.com/world-of-warcraft-collectors-bounty-july-legacy-content-1851785640]]></content:encoded>

It’s the day <em>Kotaku</em> completes the sacrament of forgiveness for AAA coverage by dedicating large amounts of space to smaller games. It’s also a good pun.</p><p>How is this difference to <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/search?blogId=9&amp;q=thanksgaming&amp;timestamp=1751627095567&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/search?blogId=9&amp;q=thanksgaming&amp;timestamp=1751627095567">Thanksgaming</a></span>, you ask? Shush. It’s a <em>good pun</em>. Unlike “Thanksgaming.”</p><p>As ever, I solicited submissions from independent developers <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://bsky.app/profile/botherer.bsky.social/post/3lt35nxrxqk2r&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://bsky.app/profile/botherer.bsky.social/post/3lt35nxrxqk2r" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">via social media</a></span>, which has resulted in hundreds of emails (239 as I start writing this), from which I will choose entirely at random. And then use a level of discretion. I implore you to look through them all, and wishlist anything that grabs your interest—doing so makes a massive difference for the developers, because it affects the mysterious algorithms running under Steam, and helps these games get more attention. Also, it’ll remind you to buy the game when it’s out!</p><p>Given most of these will be unreleased games, I obviously haven’t played them, so inclusion here is not an indication of their quality—we’re going on vibes, folks. But anything that can help get eyes on any of the approximately 20,000 games that will be released on Steam this year makes a big difference. </p><p>Last bit of business: I’ve compiled this as a slideshow, and you have to just suck that up. It pays the bills, and it’s how I can get this on the site. (But top tip: if you’re browsing on desktop, just narrow your browser window to a portrait width and it’ll unfurl into one long article.)</p></div></div><div><p>It’s bizarre to note that <em>Cupiclaw</em> is not the first rogue-lite deckbuilding claw machine game I’ve seen! At the end of last year, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/dungeon-clawler-slay-the-spire-deckbuilder-claw-machine-1851715384&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/dungeon-clawler-slay-the-spire-deckbuilder-claw-machine-1851715384"><em>Dungeon Clawler</em></a></span> was released, and it’s combination of <em>Slay the Spire</em> and arcade machine is fantastic. And it only makes me want more games using the mechanic. <em>Cupiclaw</em> takes a very different approach, however, feeling more inspired by the likes of <em>Balatro</em>: here you scoop items from the claw machine into a prize pool, and the items you gather affect one another based on their properties. You could end up blowing up all your winnings, or massively multiplying them, with the ability to tweak the contents of the machine in between rounds. I can’t wait! And am installing the demo.</p><p><strong>Developer:</strong> Typin<br><strong>Release Date:</strong> TBA<br><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://store.steampowered.com/app/2967670/Cupiclaw/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2967670/Cupiclaw/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Steam Page</a></span></p></div><div><p>Browsing the unfiltered new release lists on Steam, as I do every week, I see a <em>lot</em> of games calling themselves “survival horror.” Few look like anything I’d want to play. But wow, <em>In Hope Voiden</em> is grabbing me. First, that name! What a name. Secondly, well just watch the trailer. Look at that art! It just looks stunning, and very, very spooky. It describes itself as having both permadeath <em>and</em> persistent consequences, which is deeply ambitious—you’ll play as 12 different characters, each with a unique task to complete, and their failures impinging on all the others. Wow.</p><p>  <strong>Developer:</strong> Stillburch Games<br><strong>Release Date:</strong> TBA<br><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://store.steampowered.com/app/3726180/In_Hope_Voiden/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3726180/In_Hope_Voiden/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Steam Page</a></span></p></div><div><p>Time travelling pirates is a woefully under-used genre, so thank goodness for <em>Time Travel Shanty</em>. This is a third-person action game, with apparently some roguelite (because that’s law now) and some metroidvania. It looks like good fun, somewhere between <em>Hades</em> and <em>Zelda</em>, although right now movement looks a little stilted. (And there’s one heck of a typo in the trailer!) There’s no release date yet, so presumably still lots of time and work to come—definitely on my wishlist.</p><p>  <strong>Developer:</strong> gypynkt<br><strong>Release Date:</strong> TBA<br><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://store.steampowered.com/app/1688140/Time_Travel_Shanty/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1688140/Time_Travel_Shanty/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Steam Page</a></span> </p></div><div><p>In 2002, before widespread indie gaming was a twinkle in the milkman’s eye, there was a game called <em>Platypus</em>. It was a horizontal scrolling shooter, with all its art made via claymation, and was a critical, and lingering, success. Originally distributed via CD-ROM (because it would have to be!), it went on to get a PSP release, and then in 2009 was released for both PlayStation Network and Xbox Live Indie Games. Rather sadly, the original creators lost control, and a sequel was made and released without their involvement in 2007. But don’t frown! Original developer Anthony Flack has bought back the rights, and is working with a new team on a remake. That’s this. It’s a total remake, reprogrammed, and brand new claymation. Those gloopy clay explosions look so fun.</p><p>  <strong>Developer:</strong> Claymatic Games<br><strong>Release Date:</strong> TBA<br><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://store.steampowered.com/app/2912430/Platypus_Reclayed/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2912430/Platypus_Reclayed/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Steam Page</a></span> </p></div><div><p>The world is ending. I mean, that’s not breaking news, but it’s also the premise in <em>Exark</em>, a pixel-based city-builder, set on an enormous flying ark on its journey toward the rim of the world.</p><p>I’m just enormously pleased to inform you this is a game that involves mining cheese, and indeed rearranging the organs of a manta ray-shaped demi-god. Those are the two elements I look for in any game, so I’m well in. Also, <em>oh my goodness</em>, look at the little idle animations on those pixel animals!</p><p>  <strong>Developer:</strong> Robot Cat Limited<br><strong>Release Date:</strong> TBA<br><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://store.steampowered.com/app/3435610/Exark/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3435610/Exark/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Steam Page</a></span> </p></div><div><p>With obvious Rare vibes, <em>Teeto</em> is a third-person action-platformer, in which you play a little blue dude giving a rabbit a piggyback. Apparently the rabbit made the blue blob? It’s from a New Zealand couple (apparently one proposed to the other via the game?!), with their own toddler providing voice work. Your globular blue guy can absorb objects from the world, taking on their properties, <em>Kirby</em>-style, while you leap around a world in the manner of a <em>Spyro</em>.</p><p>  <strong>Developer:</strong> Eat Pant Games<br><strong>Release Date:</strong> TBA<br><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://store.steampowered.com/app/2783370/Teeto/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2783370/Teeto/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Steam Page</a></span> </p></div><div><p>You know what <em>Liha</em> looks like to me? As if <em>Descent</em> were made by a <em>Darwinia</em>-era Introversion. And to be absolutely clear, that’s about as high as my compliments get. </p><p>Obviously, because otherwise there’s a $45 million fine from the Indie Police, this is a roguelite, where each of your 360 degree exploratory dives to collect tech and upgrades can end in disaster. But that sounds like a great concept, and I want to play it now. NOW. But it’s not out yet, dammit. Oh, but there <em>is</em> a demo!</p><p>  <strong>Developer:</strong> Game Kombinat<br><strong>Release Date:</strong> TBA<br><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://store.steampowered.com/app/1332820/Liha/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1332820/Liha/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Steam Page</a></span> </p></div><div><p>So many explosions! This is a proper old-school space shooter, but presented in proper new-school pretties. Yes, roguelite, but inspired by both <em>Star Fox</em> and <em>Armored Core</em>, this really does seem to want to recapture space combat arcade gaming. Plus, I love the ambiguity in the art, the smokiness of the battles. You can see for yourself in a demo.</p><p>  <strong>Developer:</strong> Huskrafts<br><strong>Release Date:</strong> TBA<br><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://store.steampowered.com/app/782260/Rogue_Eclipse/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/782260/Rogue_Eclipse/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Steam Page</a></span> </p></div><div><p>I swear to god, I scour Steam for new point-and-click adventures all the time, so I have no idea how <em>Leaving Home</em> snuck past me last month. Thank goodness I stumbled on it here instead.</p><p>This is by Bart Bonte, who has been making super-stylized puzzle games for a long time, most especially during the Flash era. His latest, as you might have surmised from the title, is about leaving a home. But, not forever, just for the day. I’ve got it installing already.</p><p>  <strong>Developer:</strong> Bart Bonte<br><strong>Release Date:</strong> Out Now<br><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://store.steampowered.com/app/3726770/Leaving_Home/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3726770/Leaving_Home/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Steam Page</a></span> </p></div><div><p>As soccer becomes an ever-bigger deal in the U.S., you have to wonder which other British-dominated sports could make the transition. But surely never cricket. So massively popular in Australasia, Africa, South Asia and the West Indies, as well as the UK, it remains utterly unfathomable to the United States. So, what if someone took cricket, and combined with with a rhythm action game?!</p><p>Incredibly, that’s the conceit of <em>Bat to the Beat</em>, a game by Kunal Joshi, based out of Michigan. It sounds splendidly bonkers, and there’s a demo to double-check.</p><p><strong>Developer:</strong> Kunal Joshi<br><strong>Release Date:</strong> Q3 2025<br><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://store.steampowered.com/app/3236170/Bat_to_the_Beat/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3236170/Bat_to_the_Beat/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Steam Page</a></span></p><p>.</p></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://kotaku.com/indiepenance-day-indie-games-demo-steam-wishlist-1851785644]]></content:encoded>
