              <p><span>Usually, pro esports players are hesitant to change up their peripherals, especially before a big tournament. Getting comfortable with a new keyboard or mouse can be especially daunting when, y’know, your entire job is on the line. But a new mouse is making waves in a </span><i><span>Counter-Strike 2</span></i><span> tournament as players try to get any edge they can in the team-based shooter.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>Logitech only just released the X2 Superstrike and the new $180 gaming mouse is already becoming a fast favorite for competitive </span><i><span>Counter-Strike 2 </span></i><span>players. As pointed out by </span><a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-technology-is-just-better-why-counter-strike-pros-are-loving-a-new-mouse-that-reduces-the-time-it-takes-to-fire-their-first-shot-by-up-to-30ms"><i><span>IGN</span></i></a><span>, 13 of the ongoing PGL Cluj-Napoca tournament’s remaining 50 players have all switched over to the X2 Superstrike. Apparently no one wants to prioritize familiarity over potentially losing out on reaction time.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><span>Logitech’s website boasts that the mouse is a “breakthrough in ultra-low click-latency technology.” It uses something called a Haptic Inductive Trigger System (or HITS) instead of traditional switches to allow users to click with a lot less travel time while receiving customizable haptic feedback. Basically, it saves players even more time from the second they try to fire off a gun in an online multiplayer shooter to the instant the hit registers on the enemy player.</span></p> <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">PART 1. Here is my feedback on this mouse. It's a game changer. NO, you won't become good with this NO, but yes, the click response is faster, which I really like, and it's really great and excellent of Logitech to have created this technology. Part 2 below 🔽 <a href="https://t.co/RNQIk6L4q3">https://t.co/RNQIk6L4q3</a> <a href="https://t.co/l6XvScTLUO">pic.twitter.com/l6XvScTLUO</a></p> <p>— Polo922 (@Polo922_) <a href="https://twitter.com/Polo922_/status/2022435891852292374?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">February 13, 2026</a></p></blockquote>  <p>How much time, exactly? Up to 30 milliseconds. That’s 20 milliseconds less than the average time it takes a human to blink their eye. The <span>X2 Superstrike effectively gets you a half-blink advantage over the competition if you’re skilled enough to need it.&nbsp;</span><span>It’s probably not beneficial to casual players, but for competitive players, a more responsive mouse that can fire just a few ticks earlier can be a game-changer.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><span>According to </span><i><span>IGN</span></i><span>, Logitech apparently sped up the technology’s development after receiving encouragement from pros who tested it. This isn’t really a surprise, however, considering the fact that the X2 is basically a fancier spiritual successor to the Superlight 2, which was already a top pick for </span><i><span>CS2 </span></i><span>pros.</span></p>

 <p><span>We do know that some (if not all) of these players had access to the mouse in advance. Kscerato already won the MVP award at the Thunderpick World Championships using the mouse back in October. Still, it’s pretty impressive to see a mouse taking over a competition so quickly, especially considering that a few high-ranking teams like the Mongolz, Team Falcons, and FURIA now have half their players using the mouse.</span></p> <p><span>The X2 Superstrike is obviously a new favorite in the </span><i><span>CS2 </span></i><span>community, but I’m personally curious to see if the mouse spreads to other esports. Based on its newfound status as a hot commodity among </span><i><span>CS2 </span></i><span>pros, I could see it becoming the default gaming mouse in other competitive games like </span><i><span>Valorant </span></i><span>and </span><i><span>League </span></i><span>as well—that is, if it isn’t banned.</span></p>

            <guid>1439725</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Sorry, folks, the rumored <em>Starfield 2.0 </em>update isn’t happening. While the 2023 space RPG is getting a big update in the near future, Bethesda’s creative director Todd Howard threw cold water on the rumors of a big 2.0-like overhaul for <a href="https://kotaku.com/starfield-the-kotaku-review-1850883627"><em>Starfield</em>.</a></p> <p>On February 18, <a href="https://youtu.be/sX4rKpB97L4">as part of a larger interview with <em>Kinda Funny</em></a> about Bethesda and its games, Howard talked about what’s coming for <a href="https://kotaku.com/starfield-2-0-expansion-bethesda-ps5-2000654580"><em>Starfield</em></a>. As pointed out by host Greg Miller, he and other content creators had already seen the next big update as part of a preview event months ago, and he asked why that content was still under embargo. According to Howard, Bethesda was focused on <em>Fallout</em> and big <em>Fallout 76</em> updates last year and early this year because of the show. But now, the studio is refocusing on <a href="https://kotaku.com/starfield-exploration-astronauts-moon-boring-1851786351"><em>Starfield</em></a>.</p>

 <p>“Obviously, we’ve been working on a lot of <em>Starfield</em> content…I can tell everybody we are going to be talking about [the new content] really soon,” said Howard.&nbsp;“We’re moving into a phase where we’re ready to talk about <em>Starfield</em>. And really show that in the right way, and what’s coming to the game. We’ve been doing a lot of work that we like a lot.”</p>  <h2><em>Starfield 2.0</em> isn’t happening</h2> <p>However, Howard made it clear that folks shouldn’t expect some grand overhaul of <em>Starfield</em>, bluntly telling Miller and viewers that the update is “not <em>Starfield 2.0</em>.”</p>

 <p>“You know, I’ve seen some of that, so for expectation-setting, I think it’s the kind of thing where if you love <em>Starfield</em>, we think you’re going to love this,” explained Howard. “It’s updates and things that change the game, not in an isolated way, but sort of meta. Using outer space and things in ways that we haven’t.”</p>

 <p>Howard also acknowledged that for people who didn’t like <em>Starfield</em>, this update likely won’t change that, adding: “But look, if <em>Starfield</em> is something that didn’t connect with you right away, or you bounced off it, or found it boring in places, I don’t think this is going to change that fundamentally.”</p> <p>When Miller pushed again for a timeframe on when to expect news of this new <em>Starfield</em> update, Howard would only offer up “Soonish.”</p>

 <p>Meanwhile, Howard said that Bethesda is a “relatively small” studio and that balancing all of its roughly 250 employees across <a href="https://kotaku.com/elder-scrolls-6-is-powered-by-new-version-of-creation-engine-starfield-classic-rpg-2000670744"><em>Fallout</em>, <em>Starfield</em>, and <em>The </em><em>Elder Scrolls</em></a> is challenging. But he wanted to make it clear that Bethesda isn’t done with <em>Starfield</em>.</p> <p>“We are doing more <em>Starfield</em> stuff coming up,” said Howard. “It’s something we see continuing for a while.” <a href="https://kotaku.com/starfield-ps5-second-expansion-shattered-space-date-2000614380">Maybe that includes a PS5 port?&nbsp;</a></p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/elder-scrolls-6-is-powered-by-new-version-of-creation-engine-starfield-classic-rpg-2000670744</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>In a new interview with <em>Kinda Funny Games</em>, Bethesda creative director Todd Howard explained that <a href="https://kotaku.com/elder-scrolls-vi-6-tes6-update-release-date-bethesda-1851363646"><em>The Elder Scrolls 6</em></a> is a return to the kind of games the studio is known for and will be powered by a new version of Bethesda’s Creation Engine.</p> <p><a href="https://youtu.be/sX4rKpB97L4">In the February 18 interview livestream</a>, Howard admitted to host Greg Miller that <em>Starfield</em> and <em>Fallout 76</em> were departures from the open-world RPGs fans “expect” from them. And with <em>Elder Scrolls 6,</em> it sounds like they are going back to that “classic” style.</p>

 <p>“In many ways<em>, Fallout 76</em> and <em>Starfield</em> are a little bit of a creative detour from kind of that classic <em>Elder Scrolls, Fallout</em>, where you are exploring a world in a certain way,” said Howard.</p> <p>“As we come back to <em>Elder Scrolls 6</em> that we are doing now, we are coming back to that classic style that we’ve missed, that we know really, really well.”</p> <p>“We have a style of game we really, really like, that people expect from us, and there is a lot of innovation to be done there still, so when you step into a world you feel like you are experiencing it for the first time,” said Howard.</p>

 <p>“We’re happy with where [<em>Elder Scrolls 6</em>] is headed right now.”</p> <p>Howard also told Miller that the studio has been working hard on updating its internal engine, which has powered its past games, to help it do more with <em>Elder Scrolls 6</em> and future games.</p>

 <p>“We’ve spent the last several years bringing Creation Engine 2, which powers <em>Starfield</em>, up to Creation Engine 3, which is going to power <em>Elder Scrolls 6</em> and beyond.”</p> <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/todd-howard-elder-scrolls-vi-6-2018-e3-teaser-early-1850770820">As for when to expect <em>Elder Scrolls 6,</em> which was announced over six years ago</a>, Howard was cagey as expected, saying that while the team was close to passing a “big milestone” and development was going well, it is “going to be a while yet” before the RPG is finished.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Gamers Thought China Would Save Them With Cheap RAM But It’s Not That Simple]]></title>
            <link>https://kotaku.com/ram-shortage-ai-pc-gaming-china-cxmt-2000670712</link>
            <guid>1439695</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>For a few months now, many gamers had seemingly pinned their hopes on a company in China to help <a href="https://kotaku.com/tag/ram">alleviate rising prices on RAM</a> resulting from the <a href="https://kotaku.com/the-steam-deck-is-still-out-of-stock-and-valve-says-get-used-to-it-2000669487">ongoing and worsening memory shortage</a> fueled by AI hyperscalers and tech giants. But while new tests show the Chinese-developed RAM is good for gaming, it’s unlikely to be the silver bullet many had hoped.</p> <p>Over on the (sighs) PC Master Race subreddit, one of the largest PC gaming communities on the internet, people have been <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/pcmasterrace/comments/1pdn11s/do_you_guys_think_cxmt_will_save_us/">talking about Chinese tech company CXMT</a> with some hoping that the DRAM maker <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/pcmasterrace/comments/1qxw0gj/cxmt_and_ymtc_ready_to_flood_the_world_with_ram/">could help produce more consumer RAM</a> while the bigger players, like Samsung, pivot to supporting companies hungry for parts and memory to power future AI data centers. The idea being that while the big RAM makers focus on that, CXMT will be here for the little guys, aka <a href="https://kotaku.com/pc-gamers-are-dumpster-diving-for-ram-because-prices-keep-skyrocketing-2000667727">PC gamers</a>&nbsp;looking to upgrade their rigs without taking out a loan to do so.</p>

   <p><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/pcmasterrace/comments/1qx42x7/cxmt_priced_32g_ddr43200_ecc_at_138_link_in/">CXMT 32GB DDR4 RAM reportedly selling for less than $150 online</a> <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/tech_x/comments/1qsuwbd/chinas_new_ram_company_cxmt_is_selling_ram_at_138/">caught the attention</a> of a lot of gamers. Even though DDR4 is older and slower than DDR5, it represented a more affordable option. (And considering the fact that DDR4 is also starting to sell out and see huge price increases, there is demand for it.) Would China save gamers? <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/pcmasterrace/comments/1qtsijj/is_china_the_one_that_is_going_to_save_us/">Memes were created suggesting this was the case.</a> But the reality isn’t so simple.</p> <h2>CXMT RAM is good for gaming, but…</h2> <p>First, the good news: RAM using CXMT chips is comparable in gaming performance to RAM sticks created by bigger-name companies like Samsung and SK Hynix. In a new and <a href="https://www.techspot.com/review/3089-ddr5-made-in-china/">comprehensive report</a>. <em>TechSpot </em>tested Kingbank-produced RAM containing CXMT bits against G.Skill RAM using SK Hynix memory. And the results in games like <em>Cyberpunk 2077</em> and <em>Rainbow Six Siege</em> were promising, with the cheaper Kingbank RAM performing within a few percentage points of the more expensive G.Skill RAM. In the current market, cheaper RAM performing this well really is good enough.</p>

  <p>Now, the bad news:&nbsp;In the last few weeks, CXMT RAM has gone up in price, something noted by <em>TechSpot</em> and others. The company can’t produce nearly as much as its bigger competitors, and it is likely raising prices as demand increases, shattering some gamers’ hopes that CXMT would be the hero they hoped for in the ongoing memory shortage.</p>

 <p>Another thing to note is that CXMT has been <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bloomberg_News">essentially banned in the United States</a> for a few years now. <a href="https://wccftech.com/cxmt-ymtc-removed-from-pentagon-list-opening-door-for-chinese-dram-adoption/">And while there are signs that this might be changing soon</a>, especially with rumors that <a href="https://x.com/wccftech/status/2023756672175677891">Apple wants to cut a deal with CXMT</a> to help the tech giant fill in supply gaps, for the moment, CXMT is unlikely to flood the U.S. market.</p> <p>The other big problem is that CXMT has <a href="https://www.mk.co.kr/news/business/11957166">already committed to allocating around 20 percent of its production to creating memory for AI companies</a>. That doesn’t mean <a href="https://investors.micron.com/news-releases/news-release-details/micron-announces-exit-crucial-consumer-business">CXMT is pulling a Micron and abandoning consumer RAM</a> anytime soon, but it is yet more evidence that China’s DRAM maker will noy be some PC gaming savior. “It’s over,” posted one person on Reddit to the news of CXMT pivoting. “Not even China gives 2 hoots about the retail market.”</p>
