              <p>Carrying around multiple chargers can be such a pain – your bag ends up heavy and overflowing with cables. Wouldn’t it be nice to have just one charger that handles all your devices at once? That’s exactly where this Baseus 100W USB-C charger block comes in: Right now, <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3814/">it’s on Amazon for only $29, down from $49, which is a solid 40% off</a> – definitely a steal at this all-time low price.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3814/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Three Ports</h2>
<p>This small charger is a monster with three ports: <strong>two USB-C and one USB-A</strong>. That means you can charge your phone, tablet and even laptop all at once without having to switch back and forth between several different plugs. And don’t worry about it being slow: <strong>it delivers up to 100 watts in total power</strong> which is more than enough to fast-charge something like a MacBook Pro or any other laptop while still keeping your phone and tablet topped up. It’s got this smart PPS technology that adjusts the power depending on what you’re charging so your devices don’t get too much juice and stay safe.</p>
<p>What I totally adore is the way the plug folds: When you’re all done charging, <strong>you just fold it up and it’s really tiny</strong>. It fits perfectly into your bag or even a large pocket, no bulky charger bricks weighing you down. And it’s durable, so you don’t have to worry about destroying it after a few recharges. It’s compatible with so many of the most popular devices, like the new iPhone 16, Galaxy S54, iPad, and so forth, so that you don’t have to be carrying a separate charger for every gadget.</p>



<p>Even when it’s charging three devices at a time, this charger keeps up with the speed: <strong>The USB-C ports split that 100W among themselves in a way that each device gets enough current to charge in a rush</strong>, and the USB-A port also provides fast charging so the old devices get a speed boost without being left behind.</p>
<p>Safety features are also spot on. It’s got inbuilt safeguards to <strong>protect your belongings from overheating, short circuits, or overcharging</strong>. So don’t worry about leaving your devices plugged in overnight. It’s also energy efficient, meaning less wasted power and smaller dent on your electricity bill.</p>
<p>Get it at this sale price while it lasts, and be on your way to quicker and simpler charging of all your electronics wherever you are.</p>

              <p>Roborock is turning 11, and to celebrate the occasion, they’ve done the impossible: offering a massive price cut on their most powerful and advanced robot vacuum ever. The iconic <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3809/">Saros Z70 vacuum normally costs a whopping $2,599 but is now available just for $1,599</a> on Roborock’s website during the Labor Day holiday weekend.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3809/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Roborock.com</a></p>

<p>If you’re a <strong>tech hobbyist</strong> who’s been dreaming of owning a unique robot vacuum, it’s your time. Not only is this a massive $1,000 off, but it’s also a rare opportunity to purchase it since the device was recently released a few months ago and g<strong>enerated a huge buzz at CES this year</strong>. Getting your hands on this vacuum for that kind of money is a major win.</p>
<h2>Best Robot Vacuum?</h2>
<p>The most unique aspects of the Roborock Saros Z70 is its <strong>OmniGrip mechanical arm</strong>: It’s no standard cleaning arm, and Roborock designed it to perform on different types of floors and move into those tricky corners and edges where dust settles. It cleans with precision and leaves no spot behind. Coupled with its very thin profile—less than 8 centimeters thick—the vacuum smoothly moves under sofas, beds, and other low-clearance furniture. That low profile also means you won’t need to move heavy furniture just to clean your space, which is a huge plus for anyone who hates extra work.</p>
<p>The <strong>StarSight Autonomous System</strong> navigation system on the vacuum works with a combination of cameras and sensors to map your space with great accuracy. This tells the Saros Z70 exactly where it’s already been and where it still needs to vacuum, and avoids obstacles like furniture legs and walls. It even has a double anti-tangle system that keeps it from getting caught on cables or rugs, something far too common in other robot vacuums.</p>



<p>Perhaps the strongest spec is the suction power: At <strong>22,000 Pa HyperForce</strong>, the vacuum draws in dirt, dust, and debris with virtually unbeatable power. Most vacs for consumers, for instance, hover between 5,000 to 12,000 Pa, so this is a whole different story. It performs beautifully on carpets and picks up pet hair and crumbs, and it’s gentle enough not to damage wooden or tile floors. The Saros Z70 further features the <em>AdaptiLift</em> chassis complemented by FlexiArm riser technology: These enable it to adjust its height and grip to offer a clean one even on an uneven surface without hurting sensitive flooring.</p>
<p>Roborock also packed in the <strong>Multi-functional Dock 4.0</strong> to ensure that maintenance is easy: The smart dock charges the device not just that, but also vacuums the dustbin and refills the water tank for mopping, and removes from you the time consumed by maintenance. It’s the optimal combination of convenience and efficiency that has your vacuum at your command whenever you are ready to get to work. It means roughly seven weeks of handsfree cleaning.</p>
<p>The Roborock Saros Z70 is a real game-changer for home cleaning, and with the price cut (from $2,599 to $1,599), it’s a deal that’s tough to beat.</p>
