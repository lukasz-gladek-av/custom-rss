For brothers who literally gained international notoriety by broadcasting every minute detail of their lives for years, I’m not sure a reality series is something anyone has been waiting a decade for. </p><p>With such an announcement, you’d expect the promo machine to already be in overdrive.

Early Access begins on March 14, for anyone who purchases the Digital Deluxe Edition.”</p><p>For the first time in the series’ history, the 2025 cover features three players—Pittsburgh Pirates’ Paul Skenes, Cincinnati Reds’ Elly De La Cruz, and Baltimore Orioles’ Gunnar Henderson. A full gameplay reveal is set for February when the latest entry’s first trailer will go live. </p><p>But <em>MLB The Show 25</em> is marking some other notable firsts as well. After having been a day-and-date Game Pass release in recent years, the latest entry is going back to the standard boxed sales approach. It also won’t be coming to PlayStation 4 or Xbox One, a relief to many fans tired of PS5 and Xbox Series X/S versions feeling held back by older hardware. <em>MLB The Show 25</em> will still be on Switch however, seemingly with an upgraded version on Switch 2 whenever Nintendo’s new console releases later this year. </p><p>Both <em>Astro Bot</em> and <em>Lego Horizon Adventures</em> also skipped PS4, despite the latter also being on the less-powerful Switch. Just over four years into the PS5's lifecycle, Sony is all but turning the page on its last-gen console, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/playstation-4-5-sales-network-psn-users-ps5-ps4-sony-1851481409&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/playstation-4-5-sales-network-psn-users-ps5-ps4-sony-1851481409">even as tens of millions of players still use it</a></span>. It also sounds like <em>MLB The Show 25</em> won’t be hitting PS Plus in 2025 either. Last year’s entry hit the service in September, six months after it launched. </p><p>.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
