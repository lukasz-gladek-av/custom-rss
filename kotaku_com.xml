The card match was streamed online and the winner would receive a very rare gold Mickey card worth between $10,000 and $20,000. The winner would also move on to the Top 4 and have a chance to make it into the first <em>Lorcana</em> world tournament, so this was a big moment and a lot of people were watching. </p><h2 id="h158858"><a id=""></a>What happened during the event</h2><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.twitch.tv/videos/2369924180&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.twitch.tv/videos/2369924180" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">In the third and final round of the match</a></span>, Lentini “quested” with a magic broom card, gaining a point towards victory. Then he played Goat Merlin, a card that grants you a victory point for simply playing it. And then he went to banish his broom card to his discard pile because that card has an ability that lets you destroy it when you play another character and you then draw a card. That’s when his opponent, Fusade, complained and asked for a judge to step in. </p><p>Fusade’s argument was that Lentini had missed his chance to trigger the broom’s ability when he grabbed Goat Merlin’s point and moved on. If you’ve played <em>Lorcana </em>even casually you’ll know that is, uh, bullshit. In fact, in the official rules, simultaneous triggers can be handled in any order as long as you are clear with the other player. A longtime judge and <em>Lorcana </em>expert confirmed that <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://youtu.be/Mfpt3QNIsgc?t=305&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://youtu.be/Mfpt3QNIsgc?t=305" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">no rule was broken in a video with <em>Lorcana </em>content creator Joe “Speci” Curley</a></span>. In fact, as pointed out in that same video, Lentini did something very similar earlier in that same match which wasn’t flagged by the judge or Fusade. </p><p>That didn’t matter, hoever, because during the match the judge incorrectly sided with Fusade and made Lentini put his broom back on the board, not letting him discard it to gain a draw. This ended up costing Lentini the match and a chance to qualify for the world tournament. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://x.com/DisneyLorcana/status/1885969386676379884&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://x.com/DisneyLorcana/status/1885969386676379884" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Fusade then made it to the final match</a></span> and lost, but still qualified for the world final. The loss also cost Lentini the gold Mickey Mouse card. </p><figure id="" data-id="00dc597abb4ec73f0a6ca9baa072dc44" data-recommend-id="image://00dc597abb4ec73f0a6ca9baa072dc44" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="720" data-lightbox="true" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Disney / Ravensburger / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="00dc597abb4ec73f0a6ca9baa072dc44" data-recommend-id="image://00dc597abb4ec73f0a6ca9baa072dc44" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="720" data-lightbox="true" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/Lorcana/comments/1ifuxed/as_someone_who_just_finished_the_dlc_the_cheating/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Lorcana/comments/1ifuxed/as_someone_who_just_finished_the_dlc_the_cheating/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">There was a lot of outrage and backlash</a></span>&nbsp;<span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.thegamer.com/cheating-accusations-mar-the-first-disney-lorcana-challenge-in-oceania/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.thegamer.com/cheating-accusations-mar-the-first-disney-lorcana-challenge-in-oceania/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">over the decision</a></span>.

Eventually, the company behind <em>Lorcana</em>, Ravensburger, stepped in and announced that it was investigating the incident. And while the investigation’s full results won’t be made public, it appears there’s a somewhat happy ending.</p><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/Lorcana/comments/1ijwufp/jesse_lentini_has_been_awarded_a_gold_mickey/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Lorcana/comments/1ijwufp/jesse_lentini_has_been_awarded_a_gold_mickey/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">According to a Discord message from Ravensburger</a></span>, Lentini has received a gold Mickey Mouse card.

While it has yet to be confirmed whether Fusade was actually disqualified or just dropped out himself, based on how Ravensburger provided Lentini with a gold Mickey card, I think it’s safe to assume that Fusade was removed from the event.</p><p><em>Lorcana </em>is still a relatively new trading card game compared to <em>Magic </em>and <em>Pokémon</em>, so the community is happy to see this controversial situation be resolved in a mostly satisfactory way. The hope is that this is an indicator that Ravensburger is serious about protecting the game and the quality of its future events. </p><p> .<br></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

The comments were made in the context of a conversation about how many games get cancelled or never even greenlit that people don’t hear about. </p><p>“[The pitch] was the result of a lot of Insomniac team members being passionate about extending the story further, because I do believe that <em>Resistance</em> has set up a really cool alternate history base where anything can happen with the Chimera and where they go and what their origins are,” Price said.</p><p>While the <em>Resistance</em> games generally sold well, Price’s mention of “market opportunity” could be a reference to <em>The Last of Us</em>,<em>&nbsp;</em>which came out a few years after <em>Resistance 3</em> in 2013. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0eQMwduYw9o&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0eQMwduYw9o" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>Sacred Symbols</em> host Colin Moriarty</a></span> previously reported that Sony was worried about overloading its portfolio with post-apocalyptic games, and <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.truetrophies.com/n19511/playstation-exclusive-insomniac-resistance-4-cancelled-sony&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.truetrophies.com/n19511/playstation-exclusive-insomniac-resistance-4-cancelled-sony" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">declined to greenlight <em>Resistance 4</em></a></span> because “it sounded too similar to <em>The Last of Us</em> and they didn’t want the two games overlapping with each other.”</p><p>But that doesn’t mean <em>Resistance </em>can’t come back again in the future. While Price, who directed the first two <em>Resistance </em>games, is leaving the studio, Sony now owns the IP and, assuming Insomniac remains busy with its endless slate of upcoming <em>Marvel </em>spin-offs, could potentially farm it out to another studio, either internally or outside of PlayStation. Price seems hopeful that, one way or another, the series might still come back someday. </p><p><em>“Resistance 3</em> was intended to end that chapter of the <em>Resistance </em>franchise with the way that we ended with [recurring protagonist Joseph] Capelli and closed a lot of loops on various story items, and we wanted to do that so we would have more options in the future whether we were to go ahead with more <em>Resistance</em> games or take another turn,” Price said this week. “When you work on a franchise for a long time, it’s nice to have a chance to move on to something else and at the same time it’s also nice to be able to come back to it. Fortunately, because we’re part of Sony and Sony owns the intellectual property to <em>Resistance, </em>we will always have that opportunity to revisit <em>Resistance</em> and if it works out again, as a fan I’m going to be pretty excited.”<br></p><p>At this point, many fans would probably settle for a simple remaster of the existing trilogy for modern platforms. Since the games released on PS3, the only way to play them on PS5 remains through cloud streaming as part of the PlayStation Plus Premium subscription tier. </p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

This character requires a lot of patience to determine the opportune moment to score an elimination. Mastering the timing for her combos and the additional mechanics of her attacks, some of which are barely mentioned in-game, are crucial for improving your performance. </p><h2 id="h58919"><a id=""></a>Poke for damage and then pick off supports</h2><p>When it comes to damage and movement, Psylocke excels in controlled bursts. While she can be helpful fighting side-by-side with her teammates, she’s best played like an Assassin who prioritizes Strategists. You want to be as annoying as possible by diverting enemy attention and taking out their support heroes.</p><p>That doesn’t mean sneaking behind enemy lines is always the best strategy. You should mix up your approach now and then, but getting chased down by a more mobile hero sucks. A common tactic instead is to focus on flanking and attacking just off the side. Keep poking for damage and then dive in quickly to take out their Strategists or anyone with low health. Don’t forget that her primary fire (Psionic Crossbow) and Wing Shurikens have some major falloff damage, so you shouldn’t be attacking from too long of a distance.</p><h2 id="h58920"><a id=""></a>Maximize your burst damage with animation cancel combos</h2><p>Quite a few heroes in <em>Marvel Rivals</em> can boost their damage output through animation canceling. The idea is to <strong>use melee or other abilities to interrupt the recovery animations of an attack</strong>, allowing you to quickly chain together moves for a quick burst damage combo. A common case for Psylocke is using melee or another ability right after throwing out her dual-projectile primary fire will skip the brief recovery period. Coming to grips with these is vital to utilizing her full potential.</p><p>The optimal combo starters for mid-range and close-range can be seen below. Keep in mind that they will do more damage by landing critical hits or ending with a Psi-Blade Dash, but you’ll still be putting the hurt on your opponents either way. If your targets are especially low on health, you can also animation-cancel after the first set of her primary fire projectiles for potentially quicker burst damage.</p><ul data-type="List" data-style="Bullet"><li>Mid-range Combo: Psionic Crossbow &gt; Wing Shurikens &gt; Wing Shurikens &gt; Psionic Crossbow</li><li>Close-range Combo: Psionic Crossbow &gt; Melee &gt; Psionic Crossbow &gt; Melee</li></ul><h2 id="h58921"><a id=""></a>Always have an escape plan, and at least one dash</h2><p>Smart positioning and critical hits will help you against a single enemy, but the tables can quickly turn when fighting multiple opponents or even a full-health Vanguard. Psylocke’s kit isn’t quite meant for those situations, which is why you must always have an escape route in mind.</p><p>Most players will try to save one of their Psi-Blade Dashes just in case things go south. I’ve found that using it to dash upwards to higher ground is a great way to escape from most situations. Her Psychic Stealth invisibility can also help you out here, although it will be interrupted if you use another ability while invisible.

Only two of these are mentioned in-game, and none of them provide the associated stats either. Here are the interesting mechanics to keep note of:</p><ul data-type="List" data-style="Bullet"><li>Psylocke’s primary fire, Psionic Crossbow, reduces the cooldown of her abilities by 0.25 seconds for each bolt projectile that hits an enemy. She shoots out a pair of four bolts each time you cast the attack. Landing all eight bolts will shorten any cooldowns by a much-appreciated two seconds.</li><li>Bonus health will be granted for every Wing Shuriken projectile that hits an enemy. She’ll throw out five at a time, with each one granting 10 bonus health. Any enemy hit during the recall will also count for a maximum of 75 bonus health.

They’ll travel to her location at the start of the dash and then return to her current location. This is kind of an awkward mechanic, but the benefit is that it’ll add to the damage from your dash.</li></ul><h2 id="h58923"><a id=""></a>Getting one or two kills with your Ultimate is ideal</h2><p>Dance of the Butterfly is a flashy AOE (area-of-effect) Ultimate that sees Psylocke slash away at enemies with 150-damage attacks. It initially sounds like the perfect team-killing Ult (Ultimate), but she can only perform up to eight attacks and the target of each is selected at random, with priority given to those who have been hit fewer times. That means your chances of getting a kill are lower with each additional target.</p><p>Instead of aiming for the entire team to earn a solo <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/marvel-rivals-ace-scoreboard-team-kill-mean-1851722529&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/marvel-rivals-ace-scoreboard-team-kill-mean-1851722529">Ace kill</a></span>, use it against groups of two or three. I’d only suggest the latter amount if they’re all close together and relatively squishy with health. You’re more likely to land at least one kill here along with leaving some enemies weak, but fingers crossed you can eliminate more with the ultimate. Strategists should naturally be the priority for this, while any Vanguards should be avoided unless their health is low.</p><hr><p>Psylocke is a fun character to play, as long as you don’t assume she handles like any other <em>Marvel Rivals</em> Duelist. Focus on dishing out burst damage and you’ll be the bane of the enemy team’s existence.</p><p>.<br></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

It was taken from <em>La Isla se las Tentaciones</em>, a show that mirrors the original 2003 <em>Temptation Island </em>premise of bringing couples to an erotic getaway where their romantic bonds and libidinal restraint are put under extreme duress as other beautiful participants attempt to seduce them. That’s how a young man named Montoya found himself  one dark, tropical night on the tragic end of this Faustian arrangement on</p><p>The clip begins with host Sandra Barneda showing him what’s presented as a live feed of his partner Anita smooching in bed with her new lover Manuel before the two turn the lights off, get under the covers, and start engaging in more vigorous extracurriculars.

He tells her it’s over. She cries. More mess ensues, with online viewers trying to retrace the ethical breakdowns like John Madden explaining a five-man pass rush. </p><p>The entire clip is in Spanish, but as many English viewers have pointed out, Montoya’s spirit-shattering collision with reality needs no translation. Such is the raw, exploitative power of reality TV at its most unhinged,  when sheer drama and pure watchability are pursued at all costs.

I ladled it into a handful of plain, white Pyrex bowls and delivered it to my family at the dining room table. They were completely unaware of what I’d just witnessed. Their reward for a life lived offline. For the rest of us, “Montoya, Por Favor” will not be so easily memory-holed. </p><p>.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
