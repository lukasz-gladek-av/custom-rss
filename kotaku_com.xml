              <p>Amazon is pulling back from blockbuster games. The company is laying off 14,000 people, including some across its gaming division. According to an internal memo reviewed by <em>Bloomberg</em>, those cuts include halting a “significant amount of our first-party AAA game development work–specifically around MMOs–within Amazon Game Studios.” The company had previously announced an ambitious<em> Lord of the Rings</em> MMORPG.</p> <p>“While we’re proud of our successes in first-party AAA game development and publishing, we have made the difficult decision to halt a significant amount of our first-party AAA game development work–specifically around MMOs–within Amazon Game Studios, including making significant role reductions in our studios in Irvine and San Diego, as well as our central publishing team,” Amazon head of games, Twitch, and audio Steve Boom wrote in an email to staff, <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-10-28/amazon-makes-significant-cuts-in-video-game-division">reports<em> Bloomberg</em></a>.</p>

 <p>Amazon has mostly struggled in the world of game development outside of 2021’s MMO <em>New World</em>. It’s only other hits like <em>Lost Ark</em> and <em>Throne and Liberty</em> were developed by external partners. It’s currently set to publish the next <em>Tomb Raider</em> game as well as several other unannounced projects, including an internally developed <em>Lord of the Rings</em> MMO and an online AAA action-RPG. It’s now unclear if those projects will move on or be canceled.</p>

 <p>The latest cuts come amid a recent overhaul of Amazon’s cloud gaming service Luna, with an emphasis on party games including one <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=snoop+kotaku&amp;sca_esv=f60ecab60e0aa489&amp;rlz=1C1ONGR_enUS1089US1089&amp;sxsrf=AE3TifOXDxq2ETzQl4cY3e3JzPgqEeaJrw%3A1761669797715&amp;ei=pfIAaaqvK-Ot5NoP87KVmQ0&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjqlYS0q8eQAxXjFlkFHXNZJdMQ4dUDCBE&amp;uact=5&amp;oq=snoop+kotaku&amp;gs_lp=Egxnd3Mtd2l6LXNlcnAiDHNub29wIGtvdGFrdTIFECEYoAEyBRAhGKABMgUQIRigATIFECEYoAEyBRAhGJ8FMgUQIRifBTIFECEYnwUyBRAhGJ8FMgUQIRifBTIFECEYnwVIrglQAFjGCHAAeACQAQCYAY0CoAHYCaoBBTkuMi4xuAEDyAEA-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&amp;sclient=gws-wiz-serp">powered by an AI Snoop Dogg avatar</a>. Amazon has also reworked its Prime Game program and seemingly scaled back ambitions for its video streaming platform Twitch over the years. Its gaming retreat comes as companies race to exploit a new gold rush in AI technology.</p> <p>“Some may ask why we’re reducing roles when the company is performing well,” Amaozn’s head of people experience, Beth Galetti, <a href="https://www.aboutamazon.com/news/company-news/amazon-workforce-reduction">wrote in a new blog post</a> on Tuesday. “Across our businesses, we’re delivering great customer experiences every day, innovating at a rapid rate, and producing strong business results. What we need to remember is that the world is changing quickly. This generation of AI is the most transformative technology we’ve seen since the Internet, and it’s enabling companies to innovate much faster than ever before (in existing market segments and altogether new ones). We’re convinced that we need to be organized more leanly, with fewer layers and more ownership, to move as quickly as possible for our customers and business.”</p>

              <p>Everyone should own a quality Bluetooth speaker. They’re wonderful for so many situations whether you’re heading to a park with some friends or just getting some chores done around the house by yourself. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5060/">The JBL Clip 5 is perfect for any time you’d find yourself reaching for a Bluetooth speaker plus, right now, Amazon has it on sale for 25% off.</a> That brings the price down by $20 from $80. You’ll only have to pay $60 for a limited time.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5060/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Loud and Powerful Sound</h2>
<p>This JBL portable speaker has been made to produce clear sound with a booming bass wherever you bring it with you — and you can bring it anywhere. It’s IP67 waterproof and dustproof meaning you can take it to the pool or even the beach without worrying about it getting damaged. Heck, that’s where this thing shines. It’s engineered with an exterior combining fabric and rubber to make it durable. It will have no issue withstanding the elements or getting banged up a bit.</p>
<p>The JBL Clip 5 gets its name from having a carabiner clip integrated into its design (and being the fifth generation version of the model). the speaker is already portable because of its size, but the clip makes it even easier to take along with you. Just clip int onto your bag or belt loop. Then once you’re where you need to be, the clip comes in handy to adhere it in place like to the back of you beach charge or onto a kayak.</p>



<p>Any potable speaker worth its weight in gold is going to need solid battery life. It’s not much use if the thing dies just a few songs in. The JBL Clip 5 is able to provide you with up to 12 hours of listening time on just a single charge. If still proves to not be enough, you can turn on Playtime Boost which can prioritize power, getting you up to three additional hours out of it for a total of 15. That should hopefully be enough for you to take on the day and then some.</p>
<p>What’s fun about JBL speakers are they generally are available in a ton of cool colors and patterns. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5060/">The JBL Clip 5 is no exception on that part. You can still with the more traditional options such as the all black or all white, or you can choose to go a bit funkier.</a> Along with black and white, you also have a choice of black with orange, pink with blue, sand with green, pink, blue, purple, red, as well as “squad” which is a camouflage pattern.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/battlefield-6%E2%80%98s-biggest-update-and-its-free-battle-royale-mode-are-now-live.1336945/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Today is a big day for<em> Battlefield 6</em>, EA’s recently released online military shooter. This is the day that <em>BF6</em>‘s first massive update goes live across all platforms, bringing a ton of changes and fixes to the game. It’s also when season one of <a href="https://kotaku.com/battlefield-6-review-steam-ps5-campaign-multiplayer-2000633379"><em>Battlefield 6</em></a> goes live, turning the shooter into a true live-service game. And on top of all that, Tuesday is when EA launches <em>Battlefield 6</em>‘s free-to-play battle royale mode, <em>Redsec</em>.</p> <p>On October 28, <a href="https://x.com/BattlefieldComm/status/1983190078353449368"><em>Battlefield 6</em>‘s 1.1.1.0 update</a> went live across PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC. <a href="https://kotaku.com/battlefield-6-challenges-grind-injector-30-kills-change-season-one-update-ea-2000638854">Battlefield Studios previously released the full patch notes</a> for this big update last week, which you can find at the bottom of this post if you want all the nitty-gritty details. But the big changes worth highlighting include improvements to movement, less annoying weapon bloom, improvements to lighting and visibility, and a load of UI tweaks to help make it easier to understand what’s happening while playing.</p>

 <p>This is also the update that moves EA’s popular FPS into its live-service era, with the launch of season one and the first part of the new season, Rogue Ops. <em>Battlefield 6</em> now features a tiered battle pass with various challenges to complete and rewards to unlock. Rogue Ops also adds Blackwell Fields, new weapons, and a very awesome armored APC that can heal soldiers riding in the back. <a href="https://kotaku.com/battlefield-6s-first-new-map-review-season-1-blackwell-fields-eastwood-update-2000638228">While I’m not sold on Blackwell Fields being a new classic <em>Battlefield</em> map</a>, I’m still happy to have a new location to play on, and glad that I might not have to play New Sobek City as much. Season one of <em>BF6</em> will feature two more parts that will arrive in future updates, with November bringing the next chunk of content, including another new map that I got to play recently and really enjoyed.</p>

 <h2><em>Battlefield 6</em>‘s battle royale mode is available now</h2>  <p>Also launched on Tuesday is <a href="https://kotaku.com/battlefield-6-battle-royale-leak-nintendo-direct-september-ff9-remaster-2000622058"><em>Battlefield 6</em>‘s battle royale mode</a>. <em>Redsec </em>is both a part of <em>Battlefield 6</em> and also a fully separate game that can be freely downloaded on all platforms where <em>BF6</em> is available. If you’ve already updated <em>Battlefield 6</em>, you can go to the game’s settings and under system, you’ll find the install/uninstall section. This will let you download <em>Redsec</em> and its optional high-res textures.</p>

 <p>But you don’t need to own<em> Battlefield 6</em> to play Redsec. You can also just search for “Redsec” on the PlayStation Store, Xbox Store, EA App, or Steam, and it <em>should</em> be available to download for free. This will let you play <em>Redsec</em> (duh) and a few other competitive modes connected to the battle royale, but this isn’t <em>Battlefield 6.</em> You won’t be able to play Conquest or Rush with <em>BF6</em> players or friends. It’s just <em>Redsec</em> and its various modes/versions. And yes, <em>Redsec</em>, like <em>Battlefield 6</em>, is completely cross-platform and supports cross-progression as well.</p> <p>We’ll have to wait and see how <em>Redsec</em> turns out. Is this EA’s answer to Activision’s dominant <a href="https://kotaku.com/games/call-of-duty-warzone"><em>Call of Duty Warzone</em></a>, or will <em>Redsec </em>flop? I’m not sure, but I’m excited to at least hop into <em>Redsec</em> and find out if <em>Battlefield 6</em> makes for a good battle royale experience. Anyway, here are the full patch notes for this new season of <em>Battlefield 6:&nbsp;</em></p> <p data-block="true" data-editor="b1rd8" data-offset-key="cpdav-0-0"> <h3

        <p><span>Mere days before the highly anticipated release of </span><i><span>Hollow Knight: Silksong</span></i><span>—a DLC and Kickstarter stretch goal turned mammoth sequel to one of the most impactful games of the 2010s–the lead developers behind the game, William Gibson and Ari Pellen, broke their near-monastic vow of silence and explained the reason for the game’s long absence from the public eye. After years of no communication, during which many assumed the long-delayed game was suffering through development hell, the pair revealed the exact opposite.</span></p> <p><span>In an interview with </span><a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2025-08-21/why-silksong-team-cherry-s-sequel-to-hollow-knight-took-so-long-to-make?accessToken=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJzb3VyY2UiOiJTdWJzY3JpYmVyR2lmdGVkQXJ0aWNsZSIsImlhdCI6MTc1NTc4NjYzOSwiZXhwIjoxNzU2MzkxNDM5LCJhcnRpY2xlSWQiOiJUMUNMTUpHUFdDUFcwMCIsImJjb25uZWN0SWQiOiJCMUVBQkI5NjQ2QUM0REZFQTJBRkI4MjI1MzgyQTJFQSJ9.oTN8q1m9pNWFv7oW-n3vzq-hRWAxrDx9B7iF80RdTzk"><i><span>Bloomberg</span></i></a><span>, they explained that </span><i><span>Silksong </span></i><span>only took so long because the team had been </span><i><span>having fun</span></i><span> making the game. There was no behind-the-scenes catastrophe. No drama or rift between the members of the relatively small development team in Adelaide or the dozens of contractors who helped Team Cherry bring </span><i><span>Silksong </span></i><span>across the finish line. There was no meddling from the various publishers that, at one point or another, seemed to vie for the team’s favor and the ability to promote the titanic sequel at one or several showcases. It turned out that </span><i><span>Silksong </span></i><span>was just a really intense, and really prolonged, labor of love, a rarity in an industry that has only grown smaller and colder in the time the game’s taken to gestate.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><span>A funny thing happened during that self-imposed, years-long radio silence: </span><i><span>Silksong </span></i><span>became </span><i><span>the </span></i><span>most wildly anticipated game of the generation, outside of only the next </span><i><span>Grand Theft Auto</span></i><span>. Through little more than effusive word-of-mouth around its predecessor and a </span><a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2019/06/21/hollow-knight-silksong-feels-wildly-different-and-incredibly-familiar-e3-2019"><span>few rock-solid previews</span></a><span>, </span><i><span>Silksong</span></i><span> came entirely undone from reality and entered the harrowed halls of gaming legend. For years, players would champ at the bit in livestream chats in which they endlessly screamed “</span><i><span>SILKSONG</span></i><span>???” to no avail.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><span>At last though, on September 4, 2025, </span><i><span>Silksong </span></i><span>arrived, and with its arrival came the teardown of a long-held fantasy. Finally, we were able to see, hear, and feel the game in its entirety for ourselves, as it actually exists. Evaluate it for what it was rather than what we wanted it to be. This cherished thing that so many, across the game’s developers and its many fans, had poured an immense measure of love into for all these years.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><span>So, is </span><i><span>Silksong </span></i><span>everything that I, a self-professed </span><i><span>Hollow Knight </span></i><span>sicko, wanted? Does it live up to </span><a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/action/i-spent-all-weekend-playing-hollow-knight-silksong-and-im-totally-enthralled-but-nothing-could-completely-live-up-to-the-hype-after-so-many-years/"><span>the hype</span></a><span>? Does it reinvent the Metroidvania? Is it a cultural reset? Is it </span><a href="https://www.polygon.com/goty-2025-silksong-clair-obscur-difficulty/?link_source=ta_bluesky_link&amp;taid=68c466d11a96e10001d09c87&amp;utm_campaign=trueanthem&amp;utm_medium=social&amp;utm_source=bluesky"><span>too hard</span></a><span>? Was it worth the wait? Is it </span><i><span>fun</span></i><span>?</span></p> <h2>Act I</h2> <p><span>Well, what </span><i><span>should </span></i><span>a game of </span><i><span>Silksong</span></i><span>‘s magnitude be? To understand that, I think you first have to get what </span><i><span>Hollow Knight</span></i><span> was.</span></p>

 <p><span>In 2018, </span><i><span>Hollow Knight</span></i><span> came to the Nintendo Switch. I could wax poetic about how much the experience meant to me and how thoroughly it rewired parts of my brain. How much of my own taste clicked into place while combing the depths of Hallownest, the collapsed bug kingdom in which the first game takes place. How in touch it felt with my own anxieties. How beautiful it felt despite the collapse, barbarity, and ruin that it invited players into.</span></p>

 <p><span>The </span><a href="https://www.youtube.com/shorts/v5e_ghRxYs8"><span>now thoroughly memed final encounter</span></a><span> against the game’s true villain, a deity-like figure known as the Radiance that at first disguises itself as the sun, has not only given me my desktop wallpaper, but also, in its hero’s resistance and determination, offered me a model of absolute defiance. The weirdos, adventurers, and screwballs tucked away in the darkest corners of Hallownest have time and time again embodied the virtues of diversity and acceptance that I live my life by. Quirrel, one of those very same oddballs, is one of my favorite characters of all time, and his odyssey through Hallownest is one of my very favorite threads of the whole adventure.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <figure id="attachment_2000639593" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000639593"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000639593">©Team Cherry</figcaption></figure> <p><span>Of course, it’s hard to talk about that first game without mentioning its spectacular cadre of boss fights either, which goes well beyond that final confrontation I mentioned. While much continues to be made of the series’ difficulty, especially with the release of </span><i><span>Silksong</span></i><span>, I’ve hardly ever seen the games as ones driven by a merciless bloodlust that tests the players at every turn. Don’t get me wrong, many a </span><i><span>Hollow Knight</span></i><span> boss has stumped me, but I’ve rarely thought of these fights as particularly grueling. They’re more…rhythmic. I’ve written before about how I think </span><a href="https://www.endlessmode.com/video-games/hollow-knight-silksong/silksong-reminds-us-that-theres-room-for-tough-games"><i><span>Silksong</span></i><span>‘s combat can feel balletic</span></a><span> and, well, </span><i><span>Hollow Knight</span></i><span> was my first dance instructor. Through its rigorous gauntlets and tutelage, including the game’s now renowned bouts against the Mantis Lords, Watcher Knights, and Troupe Master Grimm to name a few, I learned my marks and how to hit them with something resembling grace and finesse.</span></p> <p><span>And as a reward for diving in headfirst and drinking so deeply of </span><i><span>Hollow Knight</span></i><span>‘s waters, I was granted the </span><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ITtPPE-pXE"><span>keys to Hallownest</span></a><span>, one of the most thoroughly realized settings any work has ever spirited me away to. It’s a well-worn trope at this point to marvel at its construction and level of detail, but the City of Tears moves me so deeply that I </span><i><span>must </span></i><span>always invoke its quiet majesty. The city’s defining quality, outside of its lavish and stately skyline, is the rain. Despite being underground, a crack in the ceiling above it–a strong but subtle metaphor among </span><i><span>Hollow Knight</span></i><span>‘s numerous elements that echo with greater meaning–invites the pristine waters of an underground lake, casting a pallid blue light over the decaying city and drenching it in a never-ending rainfall as if trying to wash away its sins.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>Though it never occurs in the game, I think about the day that crack rips the sky above the City of Tears wide open. In a rapturous moment, the lake it holds up will appear to the city’s precious few survivors like the ocean coming down on their heads, and in an instant, it’ll swallow the city whole.</span></p>

 <p><span>This, and so much more, is the precedent set forth by </span><i><span>Hollow Knight</span></i><span>. It is the legacy of that game, and it only grows with each passing year. Suffice to say, it is a hell of a thing to live up to, and a tough–some might even say impossible–act to follow and build atop. But that’s what </span><i><span>Silksong </span></i><span>sets out to do. And I tell you what, it makes a tremendous attempt, even if some cracks begin to form in the foundation under the sheer weight of it all.</span></p> <h2>Act II</h2> <p><i><span>Silksong </span></i><span>largely continues </span><i><span>Hollow Knight</span></i><span>‘s exemplary work. It once again casts players as a diminutive but fearsome warrior critter, though this time as the first game’s deuteragonist–and sometimes rival–Hornet. Much like the Knight of the previous title, Hornet is driven to Pharloom, </span><i><span>Silksong</span></i><span>‘s similarly haunted kingdom, by forces greater than herself. Along her journey, she learns of a similar corruption to the one that threatened Hallownest before–</span><i><span>Silksong </span></i><span>does make clear it is a successor that follows after</span> <span>the events of the first </span><i><span>Hollow Knight</span></i><span>. And just like the Knight, Hornet befriends many oddball (and adorable) bugs, fells terrible foes left and right, discovers many secret passages, and uncovers the </span><a href="https://www.endlessmode.com/video-games/hollow-knight-silksong/hollow-knight-silksong-difficulty-explained-religious-themes"><span>unflinching cruelty of this doomed, yet beautiful setting</span></a><span> she’s now forced to save. You’d be forgiven for thinking </span><i><span>Silksong </span></i><span>was a “lazy” sequel given these familiar parameters and beats, but the comparisons (outside of the game’s visuals and atmosphere) mostly end there.</span></p>

  <p><span>That’s because </span><i><span>Silksong </span></i><span>knows its playing the hits–which its developers workshopped in </span><i><span>Hollow Knight</span></i><span> and then sharpened here–and then spends much of the rest of its runtime constantly fucking with the foundation in ingenious, and often dastardly, ways. Like </span><i><span>Silksong</span></i><span>‘s inverted narrative–in which Hornet climbs from the depths of the kingdom as opposed to the Knight’s descent into the abyss–the game’s hostile design delights in toying with your expectations. Hunter’s March and Bilewater, two of the new locales nestled in Pharloom’s expanse (a word I do not use lightly in this game’s case), are now infamous for the way that they jostle the player and refuse to allow them the </span><a href="https://www.endlessmode.com/video-games/hollow-knight-silksong/theres-no-place-for-serenity-in-hollow-knight-silksong"><span>time and space for complacency</span></a><span>, but could you believe they’re only the tip of the iceberg?</span></p> <p><span>Later sequences, like a rad-as-hell prison escape and an icy climb against the clock, prove out how exciting it is that </span><i><span>Silksong</span></i><span>, as a core principle, kind of fucking hates the player. In </span><i><span>Hollow Knight</span></i><span>, like in most Metroidvania fare, it’s enthralling to grow more powerful and open up doors that you were previously locked out of. </span><i><span>Silksong </span></i><span>recognizes this, but slows that progression to a relative crawl and regularly forces Hornet, and the player, on their backfoot. The result is a tangibly scrappier game that is less and less decided by arbitrary numbers and levels and has more to do with what I can only describe as achieving a level of </span><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXTKa48-36Q"><span>drift compatibility</span></a><span>.</span></p> <p><span>This antagonism bleeds into several of the pain points and criticisms that have been levied at the game, such as </span><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/as-silksong-drags-them-into-the-spotlight-again-have-boss-runbacks-had-their-day"><span>punitive and demoralizing runbacks</span></a><span> to several bosses, especially one to a certain fight in a sandblasted region ripped straight out of Hell. And yes, it also extends to </span><i><span>Silksong</span></i><span>‘s several–and I do mean </span><i><span>several</span></i><span>–wave-based gauntlets, as well as its sometimes oppressive (not to mention optional) third act, both of which feel like exhaustive trials by fire. But I’ve gotta admit, I’ve learned to love this game throwing the whole damn book at me. For the most part. It keeps me on my toes.</span></p>

 <figure id="attachment_2000639596" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000639596"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000639596">©Team Cherry</figcaption></figure> <p><span>If </span><i><span>Silksong </span></i><span>is guilty of anything, it is knowing what the player expects to find at nearly every twist and turn and preempting them, sometimes with a new form of obstacle or gag, and trusting them to overcome these regular tests. This surely must be the mark of well-learned students of the medium and form, and makes the hackneyed turn of phrase “a love letter to the genre” into something resembling a more concrete argument. Since being released, </span><i><span>Silksong </span></i><span>has been accused of being a pretty unforgiving game for many of the above reasons and more. If you ask me, though, what it really is pretty damn playful. Playful and </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/the-plucky-squire-zelda-inspiration-too-on-rails-1851653126"><span>trusting</span></a><span> of your ability to pick up the game and triumph over anything it throws at you, especially with the arsenal of tools and movement abilities bestowed upon you, as well as Hornet’s natural grace.</span></p> <p><span>Reader, I hooted (I never hoot) at the </span><a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/action/silksong-hunters-march-bench/"><span>fakeout bench trap in Hunter’s March</span></a><span>. I jumped in my seat at my triumph over the gauntlet in High Halls and hardly regretted the hours I spent chipping away at it. The climb up Mount Fay falls </span><i><span>just </span></i><span>shy of </span><i><span>Celeste</span></i><span>-level platforming in my eyes, and the Deep Docks? Well, they’re never boring. And with time, these lessons all taught me to dance through the Blasted Steps unscathed by any of the man-eating sandworms that occupy it. By the time I confronted The Last Judge for the final time, I emerged free of any burns, like only the warrior-princess Hornet could.&nbsp;</span></p> <div>           <ul>                           <li>                 <p>Back-of-the-box quote:</p>                 <p>"Uptown Girl, but make it haunting."</p>               </li>                                         <li>                 <p>Developer:</p>                 <p>Team Cherry</p>               </li>                                         <li>                 <p>Type of game:</p>                 <p>Metroidvania</p>               </li>                                         <li>                 <p>Liked:</p>                 <p>Gorgeous hand-drawn world filled with thrilling encounters and challenging level design around every corner, and driven by an all-time great platforming heroine.</p>               </li>                               </ul><ul>                                         <li>                 <p>Disliked:</p>                 <p>Less cohesive than its predecessor in narrative and worldbuilding due to excess.</p>               </li>                                         <li>                 <p>Platforms:</p>                 <p>PC, PS5, PS5, Xbox Series X/S, Nintendo Switch 2 (Played on), Nintendo Switch</p>               </li>                                         <li>                 <p>Release date: </p>                 <p>September 4, 2025</p>               </li>                                         <li>                 <p>Played:</p>                 <p>About 73 hours, completing the entirety of the game's main story (including an optional third act), as well as most sidequests and optional bosses, and acquiring most collectibles in the game. Still only at 86 percent completion.</p>               </li>                                     </ul>         </div>  <p><i><span>Silksong </span></i><span>relishes in a kind of defiance that I admire. Sequels, especially video game sequels, are often bigger than their predecessors, a sin which </span><i><span>Silksong </span></i><span>is guilty of, but they’re rarely more frictional. And because </span><i><span>Silksong </span></i><span>zigs where others would zag, it has a personality that I think is rare to come across in sequels, which are so often by-the-numbers. It’s got bite and verve, just like its sharp and commanding protagonist. It’s headstrong, and its architects–Team Cherry itself–feel like a friendly rival I’m in competition with, and that back-and-forth has consistently motivated me to push back and push further. Playing </span><i><span>Silksong </span></i><span>feels like being in conversation with it, and with every session–with every talk–I regularly felt like I was learning more than I would playing a game perfectly content with playing it safe.</span></p> <p><span>And the thing is, </span><i><span>Silksong</span></i><span>‘s heights are </span><i><span>largely </span></i><span>worth these long talks and toils, but that steadfast attitude and hardheadedness only get it so far.</span></p>

 <h2>Act III</h2> <p><i><span>Silksong </span></i><span>is an exceptionally well-constructed game up to the end of its first act, filled with rousing fights against spectacular bosses that test your mettle early on, as well as locales that tease the imagination while simultaneously sating that thirst for adventure that the first game so thoroughly quenched. But it’s really in the game’s second act, which sees Hornet exploring the intricacies of the Citadel—a brass city and holy place at the very top of Pharloom—that it explodes and starts building the connective tissue that binds the entirety of this enormous kingdom together.</span></p> <p><span>Remember how I invoked the City of Tears from </span><i><span>Hollow Knight </span></i><span>earlier? How much I loved the depth of it, not only as a setting but because of the simple and powerful metaphor accomplished by linking it to Blue Lake above it? </span><i><span>Silksong</span></i><span>’s vistas enthrall me to no end, and its visuals are no doubt more varied than those of its predecessor, but it fails to tell stories as succinct or as impactful as that first game did.</span></p>

 <p><span>To its credit, there are places where </span><i><span>Silksong </span></i><span>rises to the occasion. Greymoor, a downtrodden village that sits squarely beneath the Citadel (and also boasts a rainy disposition) plays a familiar tune. That and the intended route of the Pilgrimage on which so many bugs find themselves reveal a lot about Pharloom and its people while saying very little. But by and large, I found looser connections between regions, fewer storytelling nuggets and pocket-sized narratives, and less opportunity for my own curiosity to thrive.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><i><span>Silksong</span></i><span> still yields so much to see, and there are inarguably more nooks and crannies than ever to explore in Pharloom, but Hallownest’s elegant and understated mystique is absent here, and it is instead replaced by a labyrinthine behemoth–complete with </span><i><span>many </span></i><span>proverbial Minotaurs–though one that instills in you the pressure of obligatory completionism rather than the liberating sense of adventure.</span></p>

 <figure id="attachment_2000639601" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000639601"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000639601">©Team Cherry</figcaption></figure> <p><span>At this point in my own experience with it, the sheer excess of </span><i><span>Silksong </span></i><span>began to weigh on the game, my own interest in it, and the world which Team Cherry had so immaculately constructed. Its cast of characters dwarfs that of </span><i><span>Hollow Knight</span></i><span>, but less of them stand out among the rest of the noise here. Shakra, the game’s recurring map maker and traveling warrior, is always a joy to interact with, and following her narrative thread to its end provided an emotionally satisfying resolution I’m grateful to have seen to its end, but she’s one of the game’s exceptions in this regard. By comparison, there are numerous threads I can remember following in </span><i><span>Hollow Knight</span></i><span>, like the stories of Quirrel and Cloth, as well as boss characters like the Traitor Lord and Soul Master, all of which provided narrative bows with which to wrap up and package the small, impactful vignettes across Hallownest.</span></p> <p><i><span>Silksong </span></i><span>seems interested in turning some of these interactions and asides into a more concrete facet of the series, but they almost seem lost in the expanded scope of the game. For example, job boards filled with side-quests called “Wishes” seem like they’d provide ample opportunities to expand on characters in explicit ways—</span><i><span>Hollow Knight </span></i><span>preferred the </span><i><span>Elden Ring </span></i><span>approach of loosely threaded emergent narratives—but they mostly amount to busy work and chores which fortify pockets of community around Pharloom, but rarely dive deeper into the make-up of these towns and their bug denizens.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>What stings is that underneath it all, there are some truly awesome things tucked away in </span><i><span>Silksong</span></i><span>, a game whose depth in places frequently, yes, awed me. Awesome encounters and sequences that continued to test me right up to the very end, threads which tied the two games together, and glimpses at the world outside of the </span><i><span>Hollow Knight</span></i><span> series’ haunted kingdoms that I would love to see explored further down the line. But it does also feel at times like a sequel made for players with an eye towards awe and spectacle rather than profundity.</span></p> <p><span>Maybe that weight I’m referring to, the one that threatens to undo </span><i><span>Silksong </span></i><span>at times, has less to do with literal bloat from the game’s prolonged development (though it has surely manifested in this way) and more to do with the impossible burden placed on </span><i><span>Silksong </span></i><span>to be</span><span> the most incredible game ever. I reckon that when Team Cherry first released </span><i><span>Hollow Knight</span></i><span>, they’d no idea the ripples it would make and the legacy it’d establish. And it’s impossible to separate what </span><i><span>Silksong </span></i><span>wound up being–a fork-tongued middle finger of a game that nobly aims to avoid being a standard, conventional sequel but also feels stretched in places to meet the expectations of a </span><i><span>Hollow Knight </span></i><span>game–from the reputation it built up in its time outside the limelight.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>Love breathed life into </span><i><span>Silksong </span></i><span>all those years ago, transforming a would-be expansion into a sprawling title whose development was cultivated over many years with great care and attention, which makes it all the more ironic that over the course of that development, so much of what made </span><i><span>Hollow Knight </span></i><span>special to begin with feels diminished here. That very love pushes </span><i><span>Silksong </span></i><span>to be a rich experience, one that makes you work to love it and prefers to shock rather than lull you with awe. At some point though, the former gives way to the latter, and underneath that weight, </span><i><span>Silksong </span></i><span>begins to crack. Its enormity hides these fractures well, but they’re still there. And maybe, just maybe, one day, like the City of Tears, that crushing weight will collapse the foundation and swallow it whole.</span></p>      </div></div><br/><br/>https://kotaku.com/hollow-knight-silksong-review-hornet-team-cherry-2000639568]]></content:encoded>
