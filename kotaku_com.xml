            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><span>Game Freak released an onslaught of new information about </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-legends-za-review-switch-2-bugs-performance-2000637719"><i><span>Pokémon Legends: Z-A</span></i><span>’s</span></a><span> upcoming </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-legends-za-mega-dimension-dlc-new-raichu-2000641644"><i><span>Mega Dimension </span></i><span>DLC</span></a><span> this morning, and between new </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-legends-za-mega-dimension-dlc-new-evolutions-2000641670"><span>Mega Evolutions</span></a><span>, returning characters, and a new storyline, one major change has fans scared. No, not in the “Game Freak is changing something we love and we don’t like it” way, but in the “oh, shit, this DLC might be one of the hardest challenges </span><i><span>Pokémon</span></i><span>’s ever had” way.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><i><span>Mega Dimension </span></i><span>will take players to a “Hyperspace” version of </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-legends-za-lumiose-city-ending-zohran-mamdani-2000641431"><span>Lumiose City</span></a><span> with new Pokémon and Mega Evolutions not typically found in the main game. The wild Pokémon in this bizarre place will have “Hyperspace Levels” that exceed the </span><i><span>Pokémon </span></i><span>series’ typical level-100 cap. And not by just a few levels, either. Some of the Pokémon shown in the trailers are dozens of levels higher than 100. There’s a level 164 Galarian Marowak, and I don’t think my level 100 Starmie’s Surf is going to cut it. So what is a trainer to do against these superpowered monsters? It seems like Ansha, a new character who debuts in the DLC, is your secret weapon. She and Hoopa create donuts that give your team temporary level boosts so they can venture into Hyperspace and go toe-to-toe with these “hyper strong” Pokémon, but it looks like you’ll have to gather berries and other ingredients for them to bake with. It sounds like a </span><i><span>Pokémon </span></i><span>roguelike of sorts, with you making multiple runs into Hyperspace with different donut loadouts.</span></p>

  <p><span>While there will be a system enabling players to overcome these fights, it’s still kind of terrifying to see wild Pokémon with levels that are astronomically higher than the series typically allows. For decades, level 100 has been the peak of the mountain, and even that was often reserved for online battles against real players. Now, we can just stumble across random Pokémon who are nearly twice that, and fans are reeling.</span></p> <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">My reaction when I witnessed a number beyond 100 in Pokemon <a href="https://t.co/tlQxPMAgsj">pic.twitter.com/tlQxPMAgsj</a></p> <p>— KGP (@KGPrestige) <a href="https://twitter.com/KGPrestige/status/1986446541356474438?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 6, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">You’re telling me we got level 200 pokemon before Mega Flygon</p> <p>— Agency Seven Star General blunder (@Thunderblunder7) <a href="https://twitter.com/Thunderblunder7/status/1986439900921553397?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 6, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">In order to encounter Pokémon above level 100 first you have to fast travel to the Pokémon center closest to the train station and talk to the old man.

              <p>The Most Magical Place on Earth has seen an increase in death. Four people have died at <a href="https://kotaku.com/disneyland-world-cheapest-price-time-ticket-prices-fast-1849733205">Disney World in Orlando, Florida</a>, in the last 20 days.</p> <p>On November 2, <a href="https://ew.com/fourth-disney-world-guest-dies-in-1-month-11844355">as reported by <em>Entertainment Weekly</em></a>, a woman in her 40s visiting Disney World was taken to a local hospital, where she died. The news was confirmed by a representative from the Orange County Sheriff’s Office via a statement shared with the outlet. No cause of death was shared, but authorities denied “foul play.” Disney World didn’t provide a comment when asked by <em>EW</em>.</p> <p>This is the fourth parkgoer to die in the last few weeks. On October 16,&nbsp; Summer Equitz reportedly committed suicide while staying at Disney World’s Contemporary Resort hotel located near Magic Kingdom. Five days later, a man in his 60s was found unresponsive in his bed located at Disney’s Fort Wilderness Resort and Campground. His wife called 911, and medical personnel arrived and took him to a nearby hospital, where he was pronounced dead on arrival. Two days later, on October 23, another guest at the Contemporary Resort died after a reported “medical emergency.” And then the previously mentioned death on November 2 occurred, less than two weeks later. <a href="https://ew.com/disneyland-guest-dies-haunted-mansion-11826288">Also, on October 7</a>, a woman in her 60s died after riding the Haunted Mansion attraction at Disneyland in California. She was taken to a hospital and later pronounced dead.</p> <p id="mntl-sc-block_16-0">While none of these deaths occurred inside the actual theme parks or on a ride, they did happen in and around Disney property, which includes many hotels, restaurants, highways, and more. At the moment, these deaths have not been directly connected to Disney World or Disneyland personnel, food, or infrastructure.</p> <p>Still, for a place that markets itself as the happiest and most magical place on Earth, the body count is getting shockingly high. Of course, <a href="https://www.damfirm.com/disney-deaths/">deaths have happened at Disney World before</a>, but the frequency of these recent events has put the park in the spotlight in a way I imagine Disney execs aren’t excited about.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/final-fantasy-gen-ai-square-enix-qa-bugs-2000641688</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/final-fantasy-publisher-plans-to-offload-70-percent-of-qa-work-to-generative-ai.1345972/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Square Enix is currently in the middle of a reboot. Following a bunch of flops (<a href="https://kotaku.com/foamstars-review-splatoon-ps5-is-it-good-square-enix-1851239389">remember<em> Foamstars</em></a>?) and some great games held back by timed exclusivity (<em>Final Fantasy XVI</em>, <em>Final Fantasy VII Rebirth</em>), the RPG publisher has been pivoting to a <a href="https://kotaku.com/square-enix-business-plan-multiplatform-1851472456">multiplatform approach and retooling its slate of upcoming releases</a>. It’s also, apparently, making a big push into leveraging generative AI. The company announced a new goal of having 70 percent of quality assurance and game debugging work handled by generative AI by 2027.</p> <p>“Through the use of automation technology, [we] aim to improve the efficiency of QA operations and establish a competitive advantage in game development,” reads <a href="https://www.hd.square-enix.com/eng/ir/pdf/20251106_01_en.pdf">a new presentation</a> updating investors on Square Enix’s business strategy (via <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/square-enix-says-it-wants-generative-ai-to-be-doing-70-of-its-qa-and-debugging-by-the-end-of-2027/"><em>VGC</em></a>). The project developed out of an AI-themed “idea contest” the company held, and will be part of a joint research initiative with Matsuo Laboratory at the University of Tokyo. Is this a real plan or just a way to impress investors with buzzwords?</p>

 <p>Square Enix isn’t the only company trying to apply generative AI tools to QA. While some companies <a href="https://kotaku.com/black-ops-7-generative-ai-call-duty-gamescom-2025-slop-2000618833">get lampooned</a> for letting AI slop infest concept art or even finished loading screens that appear in the game, <a href="https://kotaku.com/xbox-microsoft-matt-booty-qa-crunch-ai-mistreatment-1849496926">others have argued</a> that the job of discovering and documenting bugs is one where LLM technology will be most useful. An AI data firm <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/report-30-of-game-devs-believe-ai-will-play-an-extremely-important-role-in-qa-testing">claimed earlier this year</a> that 30 percent of respondents to a developer survey believed AI would play an “extremely important role” in QA testing.</p>

 <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">I'm convinced that statement from Square is to just get shareholders excited, because what is GenAi really gonna say when something like this pops up? Can it even critically understand what it's looking at to report the issue accurately? <a href="https://t.co/VJ5r67Fu27">pic.twitter.com/VJ5r67Fu27</a></p> <p>— Del (@TheCartelDel) <a href="https://twitter.com/TheCartelDel/status/1986413587561390345?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 6, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <p>But will it actually be any good or save studios time and money? Veteran game artist Del Walker pointed out a recent bug in <em>Marvel Rivals</em> by which a costume completely breaks a character’s model during certain animations. “What is GenAi really gonna say when something like this pops up?” he wrote <a href="https://x.com/TheCartelDel/status/1986413587561390345">on X</a>. “Can it even critically understand what it’s looking at to report the issue accurately?”</p>

 <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/activision-blizzard-s-qa-department-seems-like-a-hellho-1847473158">Quality assurance</a> has long been at the bottom of the hierarchy when it comes to game development prestige and pay, despite bugs and glitches being the first things to go viral during a game launch, setting the tone of how big-budget games are perceived. They can also make or break its initial reception if things are particularly bad. <em>Fallout 76</em> was particularly bad when it first released and was infamous early on for important updates that found new ways to accidentally break the game.</p> <p>QA, in other words, is very important, but it can also be very labor intensive. If we know one thing about companies its that they love results and hate having to pay people to produce them. It’s easy to envision a way forward where developers on the studio floor are able to experiment with new tools and see whether they work before committing to ambitious goals that replace expertise with automation. That probably doesn’t sound as good in a PowerPoint presentation, though.</p>
