There’s a specific Great Axe obtainable at the very end of the game that would likely take the top spot overall, but given that you have less than an hour of playtime left when you reach that point, it’s a rather disappointing find. As such, your best bet is to grab the mighty Seven Strivings Great Axe early in the game, and keep it upgraded throughout your adventure instead. Here’s what to know and where to find it.</p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="195579" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="This Narrative Adventure About Doomed Teenage Dinosaurs Feels Too Real" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="178" data-playlist="195579,196411,195891" data-current="195579"><div><p>This Narrative Adventure About Doomed Teenage Dinosaurs Feels Too Real</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195579/195579_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195579/195579_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195579/195579_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195579/195579_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/21074.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><h2 id="h1538703"><a id=""></a><strong>Seven Strivings passive bonus and enchantments</strong></h2><p>Seven Strivings comes with the Vicious Strikes passive bonus, which increases your critical strike chance by five percent. This may not seem like a particularly meaningful increase, but any improvement to critical strike chance is a win, especially against tougher foes you’ll be wailing on for a while.</p><p>Seven Strivings comes with the Determined Step enchantment, which grants you +15 percent movement speed for 10 seconds after defeating an enemy. You can choose one of two permanent upgrades to this enchantment:</p><ul data-type="List" data-style="Bullet"><li><strong>Victorious March</strong> - Increases the movement speed increase after killing an enemy to 30 percent for 10 seconds.</li><li><strong>Restoring Pause</strong> - Successfully parrying an attack restores 20 percent of your health.</li></ul><h2 id="h1538704"><a id=""></a><strong>Where to find Seven Strivings</strong></h2><p>Seven Strivings can be snagged extremely early in your journey through <em>Avowed</em>. As a matter of fact, you can run up and grab it pretty much as soon as you set foot in Dawnshore, as it’s just found out in the open at a location known as The Falls in the far north of the region.</p><figure id="" data-id="42f205ac19c09380274defff4f688dee" data-recommend-id="image://42f205ac19c09380274defff4f688dee" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1072" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="An image of a map showing the location of the Seven Strivings weapon in Avowed." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="An image of a map showing the location of the Seven Strivings weapon in Avowed." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Obsidian Entertainment / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="42f205ac19c09380274defff4f688dee" data-recommend-id="image://42f205ac19c09380274defff4f688dee" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1072" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="An image of a map showing the location of the Seven Strivings weapon in Avowed." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>However, while you can certainly run to The Falls right away and grab Seven Strivings, you may be a bit underpowered to fight the bounty enemy Ralga who lives within this area, so perhaps it’s best to wait a short while before venturing up there.</p><p>Whatever you decide to do, you’ll find Seven Strivings on a corpse behind the waterfall where you fight Ralga.

Rather than rushing the console release and providing a potentially poor user experience, we have made the difficult decision to delay the launch of the console versions to ensure that players receive a comparable experience to those on PC.”</p><p>While there’s no new release date for the console versions (<span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/march-2025-game-release-calendar-mlb-show-assassin-1851767497&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/march-2025-game-release-calendar-mlb-show-assassin-1851767497">PC comes out March 6</a></span>), players on those platforms will get some free rewards for the inconvenience. All would-be PS5 and Xbox players will get all in-game currencies, cosmetics, experience points, and more that they would have earned during season 1 if they’d played at launch. No grinding involved! Those who pre-ordered the game on those platforms, meanwhile, will get an extra $10 in in-game currency when the game goes live there. Hopefully the game’s not dead by that point. </p><p>If you’re sitting here asking yourself what the hell is <em>FragPunk</em>, well, it’s a very colorful, very pretty-looking multiplayer PvP FPS <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/xbox-games-showcase-2024-gears-perfect-dark-fable-starf-1851528786&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/xbox-games-showcase-2024-gears-perfect-dark-fable-starf-1851528786">announced back at Microsoft’s summer showcase last year</a></span>. Players collect cards that change how they play every round. “Cards can amplify your jump height, reverse the roles of attackers and defenders, engulf your bullets in flame or turn them into chain lightning, and even may resurrect you and your team,” reads the Steam page description. </p><p>It sounds neat, but also looks very much like “another one of those.” Weirdly, this potential also-ran is another NetEase game, which means that in addition to going up against an already crowded multiplayer field consisting of everything from <em>Fortnite</em> and <em>Call of Duty: Black Ops 6</em> to <em>Valorant</em> and <em>The Finals</em>, <em>FragPunk</em> is also going up against NetEase’s own <em>Marvel Rivals</em>, another free-to-play hero shooter that’s just three months old. Maybe <em>FragPunk</em> was the Chinese publisher’s backup plan if <em>Marvel Rivals</em> didn’t hit. </p><p>But it did, so hopefully <em>FragPunk</em> can still find some room to breathe at launch, at least so it can survive long enough for console players to give it a shot while its potential community is still thriving. </p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
