            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Here’s some good news for folks wanting an update on Sony’s previously announced <em>Helldivers</em> feature film. Justin Lin, best known for his work on the <em><a href="https://kotaku.com/the-17-moments-that-defined-the-fast-and-the-furious-1794341835">Fast &amp; Furious </a></em><a href="https://kotaku.com/the-17-moments-that-defined-the-fast-and-the-furious-1794341835">franchise</a><em><a href="https://kotaku.com/the-17-moments-that-defined-the-fast-and-the-furious-1794341835">,</a></em> is set to direct the cinematic adaptation of PlayStation and Arrowhead’s massively popular online co-op shooter.</p> <p>On December 1, <a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/movies/movie-news/helldivers-movie-justin-lin-sony-1236438370/"><em>The Hollywood Reporter</em> reported that Justin Lin is going to both direct and produce</a> the <em>Helldivers</em> movie via his Perfect Storm Entertainment media company. He’ll be working alongside PlayStation Productions on the live-action adaptation, which was first announced in January 2025.&nbsp;The upcoming Helldivers movie has a script written by <em>Annabelle</em> and <em>It</em> writer Gary Dauberman.</p>

 <p>Justin Lin is a perfect choice for <em>Helldivers</em>. He has experience working on big-budget action movies, having directed <em>The Fast And Furious: Tokyo Drift, Fast &amp; Furious 4, Fast Five, Fast &amp; Furious 6,</em> and <em>F9: The Fast Saga.</em> He also directed <em>Star Trek: Beyond,</em> the third and presumably last film in the JJ Abrams-produced modern Star Trek reboot trilogy. While the Fast movies can be over-the-top nonsense, the action and visuals within the movies are top-notch notch and each one is fast-paced. This resume feels like the perfect fit for Helldivers, especially with a solid script that leans into the absurd space-facism of the series.</p>

 <p><em>The Hollywood Reporter</em> says that Lin isn’t a gamer, but used that fact to his advantage when pitching his take on <em>Helldivers</em> to Sony and PlayStation. He reportedly wants to focus on the humanity in the characters and feature a “timely” story as well as build up what could be a future franchise for the studio.</p> <p>Meanwhile,<a href="https://kotaku.com/helldivers-2-horizon-zero-dawn-movie-ghost-tsushima-1851733809"> Sony has plenty of other PlayStation adaptations in the works</a>, including a <em>God of War</em> series, <em>Horizon: Zero Dawn</em> movie adaptations, and a <em>Ghost of Tsushima</em> anime spin-off. And let’s not forget the <em>Last of Us</em> series on HBO, which has proven to be a massive hit for all involved. Get ready, because this is just the start of Sony and other game studios digging into their vaults filled with old IP to find the next big blockbuster.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><span>Six years ago, </span><i><span>Heated Rivalry</span></i><span> was published by author Rachel Reid, the second novel in the popular hockey-rivals-turned-lovers series </span><i><span>Game Changers</span></i><span>. Now, </span><i><span>Heated Rivalry</span></i><span> is a Canadian TV series airing on HBO Max here in the US, and though it’s only been out for a few days, the internet is about to put itself in the penalty box with how openly horny viewers are getting about it.</span></p> <p><i><span>Heated Rivalry</span></i><span>, which stars Hudson Williams as Asian-Canadian hockey player Shane Hollander and Connor Storrie as his Russian-born rival, Ilya Rozanov, is what some may consider a yaoi series. The Japanese term is used for a hyperspecific media genre focused on male characters in sexual relationships, also known as Boy Love, and the series certainly seems to be leaning into that concept. There’s a lot of loaded looks, barely there caresses, heavy breathing, and, eventually, very hot sex.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><i><span>Heated Rivalry</span></i><span> premiered on November 28, and I have texted every single one of my friends about it over the course of the last few days (when describing the premise of “gay hockey men on rival teams” to my friend, she wrote back, “Did someone steal your diary?”). The show follows two players in the fictitious Major League Hockey league as they rise from ambitious rookies to superstars on the ice, all while navigating a searing hot attraction to each other. It’s currently sitting at an 86% on Rotten Tomatoes, and it seems to be all anyone (read: women, gay men) can talk about.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>I will admit that I am a huge hockey fan, so my algorithm may be slightly skewed, but both my TikTok and Twitter For You pages have been filled with people reacting to </span><i><span>Heated Rivalry</span></i><span>. Fans are posting their reactions to certain sexually explicit scenes (including one that takes place in the locker room) and others that are demure but filled with more tension than when two dudes have to sit in adjacent penalty boxes after beating the piss out of each other.</span></p> <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">the only appropriate reaction to ilya in this moment <a href="https://t.co/EbH0UgQujx">pic.twitter.com/EbH0UgQujx</a></p> <p>— Rosie 💖 (@fangirl000777) <a href="https://twitter.com/fangirl000777/status/1995341190238249354?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 1, 2025</a></p></blockquote>   <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">All you horny bitches keep tweeting about is Heated Rivalry or is my algorithm just very homosexual… the thirst is unlike anything I’ve ever seen before dear lord</p> <p>— Lushious Massacr (@LushiousMassacr) <a href="https://twitter.com/LushiousMassacr/status/1994989655993766396?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 30, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">there’s gonna be a lot of “no mom, I just love hockey” happening across the US family HBO Max plans</p> <p>— spencer (top 0.1% of spencers) (@hoddsuspenders) <a href="https://twitter.com/hoddsuspenders/status/1995251268059865542?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 30, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">you’d have to put me in an involuntary psychiatric hold if i was hollander <a href="https://t.co/a3xrMvcodA">https://t.co/a3xrMvcodA</a></p> <p>— cooper (@marnieapologist) <a href="https://twitter.com/marnieapologist/status/1994806070544666766?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 29, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="zxx" dir="ltr"><a href="https://t.co/qhLPJBRjHL">pic.twitter.com/qhLPJBRjHL</a></p> <p>— CINEMA 505 (@CINEMA505) <a href="https://twitter.com/CINEMA505/status/1994491724761370840?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 28, 2025</a></p></blockquote>   <p><span>That the lead actors are leaning into the show’s horniess is helping to increase the </span><i><span>Heated Rivalry </span></i><span>hype. Williams and Storrie told </span><a href="https://www.out.com/gay-tv-shows/heated-rivalry-connor-storrie-hudson-williams-interview"><i><span>Out Magazine</span></i></a><span> the other day that they had sexual chemistry from the opening puck drop (aka auditions), and creator and showrunner Jacob Tierney said that Williams told him that the other actor he read with, “was good, but Connor felt like he was going to pin me down and f*ck me.”&nbsp;</span></p> <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">Best back shots in the first episode of <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/HeatedRivalry?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#HeatedRivalry</a> <a href="https://t.co/gGaIAWnEzQ">pic.twitter.com/gGaIAWnEzQ</a></p> <p>— HBO Max (@hbomax) <a href="https://twitter.com/hbomax/status/1995176170711589141?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 30, 2025</a></p></blockquote>   <p><span>Even HBO Max is doubling down on the horniness. The official account posted a collage of pictures of Ilya and Hudson’s backs with the caption, “best back shots in the first episode of #HeatedRivalry.” “HBO…you’re CRAZZYYY for this,” read a reply.</span></p> <p><span>Sexy men being sexy together is great fodder for the internet, but there’s another layer that makes </span><i><span>Heated Rivalry </span></i><span>so special. Ilya and Hudson have to keep their romance a secret not just because they play for rival teams, but because of the frustratingly regressive ideologies that plague professional hockey. The NHL, as of writing, has zero openly gay players, and has waffled back-and-forth between supporting its LGBTQ+ fans and ignoring them—or, if you’re the Staal brothers, </span><a href="https://www.espn.com/nhl/story/_/id/35927172/brothers-eric-marc-staal-decline-wear-panthers-pride-night-jerseys"><span>refusing to participate in a Pride Night</span></a><span> because of their “Christian beliefs.”</span></p> <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">ok so unfortunately heated rivalry is incredible. was hoping i would not fall down the gay smut pipeline but my eyes are not deceiving me. the characters are multi-dimensional, the plot is intense, and the smut? yeah, i need more.</p> <p>— spencer thomas (@byspencerthomas) <a href="https://twitter.com/byspencerthomas/status/1994668899401712047?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 29, 2025</a></p></blockquote>   <p><i><span>Heated Rivalry</span></i><span> takes an incredibly straight sport and injects some queerness into it, and from what everyone is saying, it does so deftly and sexily. I have it queued up to start watching tonight for…research purposes.&nbsp;</span></p>

              <p>Extraction shooter <a href="https://kotaku.com/arc-raiders-review-extraction-loot-shooter-embark-2000642198"><i>Arc Raiders</i></a> sells you the fantasy of being either a lone wanderer or part of a ragtag crew, rummaging through the wreckage of a fallen civilization to rebuild something better. Along the way, you can expect brutal gunfights with deadly machines and <a href="https://kotaku.com/arc-raiders-pvp-betrayal-bounty-rat-camp-2000649163">traitorous fellow raiders</a>. It <a href="https://kotaku.com/arc-raiders-extraction-shooter-constantly-dying-2000649095">makes for a great adrenaline rush</a> as you exchange fire with man and machine.</p> <p><b>Read More:</b> <a href="https://kotaku.com/arc-raiders-extraction-shooter-constantly-dying-2000649095"><i>Arc Raiders </i>Is So Good I Keep Playing No Matter How Much I Suck</a></p> <p>But recently, I had the pleasure of chatting with a player who’s found a different role to play in <i>Arc Raiders</i>’ post-apocalyptic Italy: that of a fruit salesman.</p>

 <p>Reddit user GrumbleGrits recently shared a video of this experience, putting down firearms in exchange for fruit and other harmless goods. Check it out <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ArcRaiders/comments/1oxoism/welcome_to_the_fruit_shop/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button">here</a>:</p>   <p>This moment speaks to what I love about the extraction shooter genre and how it breaks open the expected routine of what we do in these kinds of games. The simple premise of getting in, grabbing loot, and getting out leaves a wide open space in between for unexpected emergent outcomes and creative playstyles, and that includes subversive ways of interacting with others. In a game where you can just as easily <i>not</i> shoot other players as you can otherwise murder them, why not consider peace? Why not find a new way to ascend the game’s meta?</p>

 <p><b>Read More:</b> <a href="https://kotaku.com/arc-raiders-pvp-betrayal-bounty-rat-camp-2000649163"><i>Arc Raiders</i> Fans Have A New Tool For Revenge Against Assholes</a></p> <p>That’s what GrumbleGrits and others have done. We recently chatted a bit over DM on Reddit about his experience as a post-apocalyptic fruit farmer setting up shop in an abandoned newsstand.</p>

 <p>Though he was quick to point out that <a href="https://youtu.be/wGr0f4vxfic">there are others in <i>Arc Raiders</i> setting up trade shops</a> (and many people coordinate on Reddit and elsewhere to arrange a trade for various hide-to-find pieces of loot) and insisted that he doesn’t want to receive any special credit for his efforts, setting up a fruit stand in the game certainly requires work.</p>

  <p>“I always try to have different stock each time,” he told me. “Sometimes I bring as many harvestable plants as I can, typically focusing on the materials needed to train Scrappy.” He’ll even trade non-edible goods as well, such as the many forms of loot that exist for no other reason than to sell to the in-game NPCs.</p>

 <p>But fruits and plants, which are needed to level up the player’s pet rooster that dispenses materials after every match, are important and, critically, often hard to come by. <i>Arc Raiders</i>’ typically unexpected and excessive violence can make holding on to these materials all the way to extraction hard enough as it is. That violence is something GrumbleGrits has to contend with when trading his goods.</p>

 <p>“It’s not all sunshine and rainbows,” he said, “getting to the chosen location for my storefront, clearing out Arc, and surviving any aggressive raiders along the way can be really difficult and occasionally results in tragedy. Once I reach the spot and get situated, I usually don’t have much issue with being attacked by other raiders.”</p> <p><b>Read More: </b><a href="https://kotaku.com/arc-raiders-field-depot-crate-off-radar-down-to-earth-2000642525">This Is The ‘Easiest’ Field Depot In <i>Arc Raiders</i></a></p> <p>It’s a very different kind of fantasy than many are used to when it comes to <i>Arc Raiders</i>: venturing out not to just find what you can and keep it for yourself, but doing so with the intention to trade it with others, and putting in the work to establish a safe trading zone.</p> <p>It’s not the only way GrumbleGrits plays, of course. “Between working a real-world job and engaging with all the various other systems of <i>Arc Raiders</i>, and collecting items to trade away in the first place, it can be difficult to find time to goof off and set up these little shops,” he said. While trading fruit makes for a unique way to interact with others and use the game’s loot system, GrumbleGrits isn’t throwing down his weapons permanently any time soon. Just recently, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ArcRaiders/comments/1pb39k2/goodbye_big_lady_my_first_queen_kill/">he shared some footage of his first Queen kill</a>. But who knows, maybe the loot he’ll earn from this battle might show up on a store shelf soon.</p>

 <p>Of course, the experience is not without its theatrics. “I once had a couple of guys duel to the death with their melee weapons for a stack of mushrooms,” he said, recounting one of the more unique situations. “It was a violent and quick battle,” he said, “a testament to how sought-after mushrooms can be. They’re difficult to find if you don’t know where to look.”</p> <p>Thankfully, GrumbleGrits and other players not only know where to look for hard-to-find loot, but they’re also willing to share the wealth.</p>
