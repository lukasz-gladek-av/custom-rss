              <p><span>I waited over a decade for my favorite Pokémon to get a Mega Evolution, and </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-legends-za-review-switch-2-bugs-performance-2000637719"><i><span>Pokémon Legends: Z-A</span></i></a><span> finally gave it to me. I dove headlong into the RPG upon release, spending every spare moment I could in </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-legends-za-mega-dimension-evolution-raichu-x-2000652246#:~:text=the%20citizens%20of-,Lumiose%20City,-.%20It%E2%80%99s%20a%20Pidgey"><span>Lumiose City</span></a><span>, but now that I’m nearly done with everything the game has to offer, I’m starting to feel my running and jumping through the streets of its Paris-inspired setting shift to a light jog.&nbsp; As I catch the last few monsters in the expansion’s dex and cross off the remaining sidequests, my steps slow as I wait for my Mega Raichu, </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-legends-za-mega-dimension-evolution-raichu-x-2000652246"><span>flying behind me like he’s Superman, to catch up</span></a><span>, savoring a few more seconds with his golden, two-tailed, superpowered form.</span></p> <p><span>A friend of mine who also happens to be one of the biggest </span><i><span>Dragon Age </span></i><span>fans I’ve ever known was visiting me in New York City a few months back, and I was surprised to learn that she hadn’t finished 2024’s </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/dragon-age-veilguard-4-review-dreadwolf-rook-action-rpg-1851681954?_gl=1*1qxy3gl*_ga*MTMxODc3NjkwMi4xNzI1Njc2NzM3*_ga_V4QNJTT5L0*czE3NDk3NDk3MDkkbzI2OSRnMSR0MTc0OTc0OTc1NiRqMTMkbDAkaDA."><i><span>The Veilguard</span></i></a><span>, despite being positive on it. She explained that, especially after everything that’s happened to BioWare in the past year, she felt like seeing the credits roll on this latest entry would mean the end of a “moment” of her life, as </span><i><span>Dragon Age</span></i><span>’s </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/dragon-age-the-veilguard-bioware-layoffs-mass-effect-1851784416"><span>future seems murky</span></a><span> at best. I kind of understood, but part of me is also of the mind that seeing something through to the end is only half the experience. Sitting with it and examining its complexities is just as important. But eventually, you exhaust yourself of all that reflection and move on to something else. My reluctance to put </span><i><span>Z-A </span></i><span>in the rearview mirror is helping me understand where she was coming from, and why people often opt not to finish games they deeply admire and enjoy. It is comforting knowing that you haven’t hit that endpoint yet, even if it means you’re depriving yourself of something you love.</span></p>

 <p><span>I’ve been writing about </span><i><span>Legends: Z-A </span></i><span>for months here at </span><i><span>Kotaku</span></i><span>, and I can feel that part of me that loves to critically analyze and engage with these games preparing to move on as next month’s inevitable Generation X announcement on Pokémon Day approaches. This game has been a really compelling experiment , letting Game Freak play around with real-time battles and a single-city setting, and I truly wish the studio would release another major DLC expansion or </span><i><span>something</span></i><span> to keep it going. But I also recognize it’s done what it needed to do. I don’t need more for more’s sake. In fact, with most video game franchises, I prefer things to go away forever after they’ve run their course.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <figure id="attachment_2000657801" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000657801"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000657801">© The Pokémon Company / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p><i><span>Pokémon </span></i><span>is a weird outlier for me on that front as I’m always down to explore a new place in this universe, and since Game Freak took a year without a new game or DLC pack in 2024, the gap between </span><i><span>Scarlet </span></i><span>and </span><i><span>Violet</span></i><span>’s expansions and </span><i><span>Legends Z-A</span></i><span> felt painfully long. So even if </span><i><span>Mega Dimension </span></i><span>hadn’t given Raichu two much needed Mega Evolutions, I would have been squeezing every drop of Pokéjuice out of this game. But on top of that, my superhero rat just got here, and I would be surprised if Mega Evolution showed up in the next pair of RPGs we’re probably getting our first glimpse of next month.</span></p>

 <p><span>I put over 120 hours into </span><i><span>Legends Z-A</span></i><span> and its DLC. I had Mega Raichu by my side for about 60 of those hours, and that still doesn’t feel like enough. Raichu and I will inevitably meet up again in the next game, but it sure hurts knowing I waited all this time to have him Mega Evolve just for it to only last a couple of months before we move on. Lumiose City may not be pretty to look at, but I still love hanging out with its weird citizens who say odd shit and love this metropolis with all their heart. I’m not ready to say goodbye just yet.</span></p>

 <p><span>So now, to make it last just a little bit longer, all I can do is bide my time. I’m booting up my Switch 2 less often. I’m doing menial tasks and wandering in places I’ve already seen dozens of times. As long as there’s an incomplete quest or a Pokémon I haven’t added to my Pokédex, I have a reason to come back. The knowledge that it’s not over is somehow more comforting than having one less game on my backlog list.</span></p>

              <p>Consoles used to come in fun colors, sometimes with transparent shells and other wild features. Those days are long gone, and now we mostly get stuck with black and white consoles with a few limited color options for accessories. So I’m happy to see Sony announcing some genuinely cool-looking console covers and controllers for the PlayStation 5 arriving in March.</p> <p>On January 7, <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2026/01/07/revealing-the-hyperpop-collection-with-three-new-designs-for-ps5-accessories-launching-this-march/">PlayStation unveiled its Hyperpop Collection</a>, which features three vibrant new PS5 console covers and controllers. You can get a PS5 shell or Dualsense gamepad in Techno Red, Remix Green, and/or Rhythm Blue. Silly names aside, these console shells look awesome, sporting a gradient design that goes from black on the top to a vibrant color at the bottom, assuming you have your PS5 standing up next to your TV.</p>

  <p>However, what I really find exciting are the three new controllers, which also sport the same black to color gradient pattern. These things look sick as heck, and I want one right now to replace the boring black Dualsense controller I’ve been using for a bit now.</p>

 <p>Sony says the console covers will cost $75, and the Hyperpop Dualsense controllers will be priced at $85. That’s $10 more than a standard Dualsense, which is annoying. But that gradient design is soooo good that I’m willing to pay the extra price. I’ll just consider it a cool tax.</p>

 <p>Unfortunately, I’ll have to wait a bit before I can get my hands on that Remix Green Dualsense controller. The Hyperpop Collection launches on March 12, 2026, with Sony starting pre-orders for the slick-looking hardware on January 16, 2026 at select retailers and on PlayStation’s official store.</p>
