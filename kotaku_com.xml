              <p>If you’re sitting at your desk, do me a favor and look around for a moment. What’s your setup look like? Do you have a good keyboard? How are your speakers? How big is your monitor? Is there more than one? When it comes to PC gaming, there’s so may areas you can upgrade, and we didn’t even cover the stuff under the hood like your GPU and CPU. with all the shiny, new products you can buy level up your space, it’s easy to overlook something small but important—the mouse.</p>
<p>Your mouse is 50% off how you’re interacting with the games you play, assuming you use mouse and keyboard.&nbsp;It’s time to ditch that ten dollar mouse you picked up in the checkout lane of Staples, and get something solid. The Logitech G Pro X SuperLight 2 wireless gaming mouse right now goes for $180. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4251/">However, an Amazon limited time deal is currently bringing it down to just $130. That 28% discount saves you $50.</a></p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4251/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>For the Pros, By the Pros</h2>
<p>This Logitech mouse was engineered to be your optimal gaming peripheral. Professional e-sports players were consulted in designing the mouse with rigorous hands-on testing to ensure every curve and click is unmatched.</p>
<p>Designed for speed and precision, this gaming mouse from Logitech has a powerful sensor—the HERO 2—capable of an 8 kHz polling rate, an 88g acceleration, an 888 IPS speed, and up to 44,000 DPI sensor calibration. It uses zero-additive PTFE mouse feet, which allows the mouse to glide smoothly across your desktop.</p>
<p>With the Logitech G Pro X SuperLight 2, you get five different programmable buttons which can be mapped to anything and allowing you to act more quickly to enemies in&nbsp;<em>League of Legends</em> or whatever is your game of choice.</p>



<p>This mouse has a crazy 95-hour battery life. So long as you remember to plug it in every few gaming sessions, you’ll never have to worry about it dying on you. If your gaming sessions are somehow longer than that, well it may be time to go touch grass. It charges over USB-C.</p>
<p><strong>This Logitech gaming mouse is compatible with both Mac and PC and you have your choice of either black or white</strong>. There is a sleek magenta option as well, but that one is unfortunately not part of the sale. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4251/">So long as you go black or white, you’ll get the mouse for a cool $50 discount.</a> That brings the price down for as limited time from $180 to just $130.</p>

              <p><span>After some </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/playstation-showcase-state-play-tgs-2025-ff7-remake-part-3-2000626000"><span>rumors and speculation</span></a><span> suggesting we’d be getting one ahead of Tokyo Game Show, Sony has </span><a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/09/23/state-of-play-returns-this-wednesday-september-24/"><span>announced a new State of Play presentation</span></a><span> for tomorrow, September 24. The showcase will include 35 minutes of new games, both from third-party developers and Sony’s PlayStation Studios.</span></p> <p><span>The only game we know will be in the show right now is </span><i><span>Saros</span></i><span>, the new game from Returnal developer Housemarque. The action game was first revealed </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/sony-playstation-state-play-2025-everything-we-saw-sop-1851761893"><span>back in February</span></a><span> and features </span><i><span>iZombie</span></i><span> and </span><i><span>Fall of the House of Usher</span></i><span> actor Rahul Kohli as the lead actor. It’s set to come to PlayStation 5 next year. I’d be shocked if we got a release date tomorrow, but we will see at least five minutes of gameplay.</span></p> <p><span>The show will begin tomorrow at 2 p.m. Pacific / 5 p.m. Eastern, and will be streaming on PlayStation’s </span><a href="https://www.youtube.com/playstation"><span>YouTube</span></a><span> and </span><a href="https://www.twitch.tv/playstation"><span>Twitch</span></a><span> accounts. After so many long showcases this summer, it’s nice to get something that’s only 35 minutes long. Thank you, Sony, for your mercy, especially because this is taking place after typical working hours for those of us on the East Coast.</span></p>

 <p><span>Beyond </span><i><span>Faros</span></i><span>, it’s unclear what games might make an appearance. </span><i><span>Ghost of Yōtei </span></i><span>is a little over a week away, so it would make sense for Sony to spend a little time promoting the game and reminding people that the samurai sequel is imminent. I’m sure someone at Sony thinks it could use some positive buzz after the </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/ghost-yotei-charlie-kirk-joke-playstation-sony-2000625478"><span>past couple of weeks of controversy</span></a><span>. I’d be surprised if they spent too much time on it, though, considering it’s about to get another wave of chatter when reviews go live later this week.</span></p> <p><span>Thoughts and prayers to the </span><i><span>Kingdom Hearts </span></i><span>fans who are no doubt hoping we’ll hear more about </span><i><span>Kingdom Hearts IV </span></i><span>tomorrow. I am on your side, but I cannot bring myself to actually feel hope.</span></p>

              <p>Given the endless waterfall of garbage that arrives on Steam, it might seem like you can upload and sell absolutely anything on the storefront. However, there <em>are</em> meant to be some verification checks in place to prevent the most egregious examples of nefarious content from reaching the platform—it’s just it doesn’t always work. Hence <em>BlockBlasters</em>, a Trojan-Horse 2D platformer that released as an innocent game, before being updated such that it could start draining players’ crypto wallets. And tragically, this was discovered during a livestream fundraiser for a streamer with stage-4 cancer.</p> <p>As <a href="https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/verified-steam-game-steals-streamers-cancer-treatment-donations/">reported by&nbsp;<em>Bleeping Computer</em></a>, <em>BlockBlasters</em> went on sale on July 30 as yet another 2D platformer on Valve’s industry-dominating PC store. But a month later, on August 30, <a href="https://steamdb.info/patchnotes/19799326/">the game was updated with a couple of zip files</a>, which appear to have contained malware that allowed the game to empty players’ crypto wallets.</p> <p>The “game” was obviously released as free, to tempt as many people into taking a look as possible. However, <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/3872350/charts/">according to SteamDB</a> it seems&nbsp;<em>BlockBlasters</em> only managed to attract a very small number of players. Estimates show it as having had under 7,000 downloads, while concurrent player counts never exceeded a desultory eight. That would have sucked if you’d poured your heart into a platformer, but clearly that wasn’t the plan here from first-time (and presumably last-time) developers Genesis Interactive.</p>

 <p>It was only when streamer Raivo Plavnieks (RastalandTV) was <a href="https://www.gofundme.com/f/57p5a-help-me-beat-stage-4-cancer">running a fundraiser</a> to help raise money to treat his stage-4 sarcoma that the cruel nature of the malware became apparent. Someone tuned in and encouraged crypto enthusiast Plavnieks to download <em>BlockBlasters</em>, when the extremely sick man watched $32,000 drain from his funds. “My life was saved for whole 24 hours,” the streamer <a href="https://x.com/rastalandTV/status/1969629808788181258">wrote on X</a>, “untill someone tuned in my stream and got me to download verified game on @Steam.” (Please be warned that the video clip embedded in the post is particularly upsetting.)</p>

 <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">For anybody wondering what is going on with <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%24CANCER&amp;src=ctag&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">$CANCER</a> live stream… my life was saved for whole 24 hours untill someone tuned in my stream and got me to download verified game on <a href="https://twitter.com/Steam?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@Steam</a> <br>After this I was drained for over 32,000$ USD of my creator fees earned on <a href="https://twitter.com/pumpdotfun?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@pumpdotfun</a> and… <a href="https://t.co/8YH4njd46E">pic.twitter.com/8YH4njd46E</a></p> <p>— rastaland.TV (@rastalandTV) <a href="https://twitter.com/rastalandTV/status/1969629808788181258?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">September 21, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <p>“I can’t breathe, I can’t think,” the Latvian gamer added. “im completely lost on what is going to happen next, can’t shake the feeling that it is my fault that I might end up on street again or not have anything to eat in few days.”</p>

 <p>However, according to&nbsp;<em>Bleeping Computer</em>, what happened next is a rallying from other crypto types, with crypto influencer Alex Becker posting to X to say he’d sent Plavnieks $32,500 to cover the losses.</p> <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">I have sent $32,500 to cover this to your new safe wallet.   Best of luck to you my friend. &lt;3.<a href="https://twitter.com/rastalandTV?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@rastalandTV</a> </p> <p>Receipt below.</p> <p>— Alex Becker 🍊🏆🥇 (@ZssBecker) <a href="https://twitter.com/ZssBecker/status/1969774353211695441?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">September 21, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <p><em>BlockBlasters</em> was removed from Steam on September 21, the same day as the stream, presumably after a flood of resulting reports. However, it shows serious weaknesses in Valve’s store that malware can so easily be added to games. Earlier this year a web3 “game” called&nbsp;<a href="https://uk.pcmag.com/security/156674/did-you-download-this-steam-game-sorry-its-windows-malware"><em>PirateFi&nbsp;</em>was stealing Steam accounts</a>, and it’s just another of many examples.</p> <p>As a rule, the safest option is to take no part in the entire crypto scam in the first place. Put your money in a bank, or hide it under your mattress, but not in the criminal underworld that is cryptocurrency. And if anything is marked as “web3,” avoid it like the plague it is.</p>
