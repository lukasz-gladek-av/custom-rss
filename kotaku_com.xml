The program will let players design custom logos for stadiums and jerseys in <em>College Football 25</em>'s Team Builder mode, either from scratch or using generative AI. </p><p>“Team Builder is getting an upgrade!” reads the developer commentary part of the patch notes. “We’re excited to announce a new partnership with our friends from Adobe.

Some players already use Adobe to make their designs and import them separately, while others prefer to use the in-game tools. “God, I hope they keep the Adobe thing as optional because I have a fear it will become Adobe everything by the next game so they can have that partnership and reap more money off this game,” wrote one fan on the subreddit. “As well Adobe at least for me is a slow-ass tool.”</p><p>Earlier this year, EA CEO Andrew Wilson <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/ea-college-football-25-generative-ai-fifa-1851609733&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/ea-college-football-25-generative-ai-fifa-1851609733">said that AI tools</a></span>, including machine learning, were the only way that <em>College Football 25</em>, with thousands upon thousands of unique players hailing from all different schools, was able to be made. It’s the franchise’s first new sequel since 2013 back when it was called <em>NCAA Football 14</em>.

The small patch fixed and tweaked various bugs and mistakes, as you would expect, but buried in the patch notes is one fix that caught the attention of <em>Team Fortress 2'</em>s most dedicated fans. </p><ul data-type="List" data-style="Bullet"><li>Fixed BLU Scout using the incorrect team color pants</li></ul><p>Without any context that might just seem like yet one more tiny bug fixed by Valve, but this has actually been a problem in <em>TF2</em> since its release. And although fans have pointed it out in the past, it was never addressed. Blu Scout’s pants, for the last 17 years, have been brown, which is incorrect. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/TwoBestFriendsPlay/comments/1gbfv95/so_apparently_for_the_last_17_years_blu_scouts/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/TwoBestFriendsPlay/comments/1gbfv95/so_apparently_for_the_last_17_years_blu_scouts/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">His pants should be grey, just like all the other classes on the Blu Team</a></span>. Brown pants are intended for Red Team members. Yet, this mistake has persisted for nearly two decades, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://github.com/ValveSoftware/Source-1-Games/issues/2289&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://github.com/ValveSoftware/Source-1-Games/issues/2289" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">despite the evidence</a></span>.</p><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://x.com/heavyfortres/status/1849564536795242979&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://x.com/heavyfortres/status/1849564536795242979" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">And then, out of nowhere, Valve fixed it</a></span>. Now Blu Scout’s pants are grey, which is nice, although it also means <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.reddit.com/media?url=https%3A%2F%2Fpreview.redd.it%2Fo63oo3kk0swd1.png%3Fauto%3Dwebp%26s%3D291d62f437c6c67d5d13b10f3f73cd15dbbe6abf&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.reddit.com/media?url=https%3A%2F%2Fpreview.redd.it%2Fo63oo3kk0swd1.png%3Fauto%3Dwebp%26s%3D291d62f437c6c67d5d13b10f3f73cd15dbbe6abf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">a bunch of community-created cosmetics</a></span> for that character look ugly because they were designed with brown pants. </p><p>Why now, after 17 years, did Valve fix this long-known <em>TF2 </em>bug? We don’t know, and because Valve famously doesn’t explain many of their decisions or plans, your guess is as good as mine. </p><p>However, I have a theory about this change. Last year, around this same time, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/half-life-new-update-fixed-old-bug-animation-blast-pit-1851043667&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/half-life-new-update-fixed-old-bug-animation-blast-pit-1851043667">Valve fixed a very old bug in <em>Half-Life</em></a></span> involving a monster’s animation. I think as the year wraps up, Valve might let devs tinker as the holidays approach, and perhaps that’s why this patch has suddenly appeared. Maybe someone got a bit of free time and used it to hop into <em>TF2 </em>and correct this mistake? </p><p>Or perhaps Valve just likes trolling fans? Maybe both! Anyway, Scout’s pants are finally the correct color and we can all sleep easy knowing that the world is a better place. </p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

That’s less likely to be the case for <em>Kotaku</em>’s Willa Rowe, who described the show as “[Croft’s] most boring adventure yet.” Wider critical reception was extremely mixed, with <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.metacritic.com/tv/tomb-raider-the-legend-of-lara-croft/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.metacritic.com/tv/tomb-raider-the-legend-of-lara-croft/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">its Metascore</a></span> sitting at a middling 65, but with scores spread from 5 to 9 out of 10.

Lara’s thrilling new adventure takes her around the globe as she delves deeper into the hidden secrets of Orisha history, dodges the machinations of a dangerous and enigmatic billionaire who wants the masks for herself, while discovering these relics contain dark secrets and a power that defies logic. Power that may, in fact, be divine.</p></blockquote><p>It at least sounds a bit more exciting that the first season, and confirms the main voice actors are returning to the project.</p><p>Of course, the animation also drew the Eye of Mauron, because—I dunno—Lara’s breasts weren’t scraping on her toes, or that one character who was also in that one game in 2006 wasn’t a carbon copy? You know how they are, confusing the entire world and all that exists within it with their personal masturbatory material. User scores are extremely low, as a result of sad little boys who are too scared to go to Porn Hub. So on this level alone, it’s a pleasure to see the show renewed, just to watch them have to put their “GO WOKE GO BROKE” jpegs back in their soggy pockets.</p><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://deadline.com/2024/10/spike-jonze-series-netflix-dead-1236157805/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://deadline.com/2024/10/spike-jonze-series-netflix-dead-1236157805/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">We also learned</a></span> today that Spike Jonze’s exciting-sounding sci-fi project is no more, before filming even began.
