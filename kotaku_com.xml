              <p>Mini computers offer a great way of enjoying powerful performance while keeping things minimal and mess-free. If you’re after a solid option from Apple, Amazon is making the upgrade quite easy.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4124/">If you act fast, you can grab the 2024 Mac mini desktop computer (16GB memory, 256GB storage) with the super-fast M4 chip for $479, after a nice 20% discount.</a> It’s rated as Amazon’s Choice at the retailer, and has plenty of good reviews backing it up. Those looking to have it delivered before Christmas should place their orders today, as delays can push the delivery past the holiday season. Not married to the Apple brand? There are plenty of other mini PCs going at a discount right now, too. We’ve been covering the best drops (across multiple retailers) out there, so be sure to check our Deals page to find the one that fits your needs and budget.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4124/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Supercharged By M4</h2>
<p>This mini, yet mighty PC is five by five inches of incredible power. Design-wise, it’s quite sleek and is made to sit nicely next to a monitor, or anywhere else, without cluttering things up. It runs on the powerful M4 chip, which delivers incredible performance for all your tasks, whether you’re working on a group project for school, editing a creative project, developing a presentation, or brainstorming ideas. The chip also makes it up to 13x faster than the fastest Intel-based Mac mini, which means you can rely on it for your everyday tasks, as well as those busy, productive days where you’re handling a bit too much at the same time. Additionally, macOS is quite convenient to use and lets you run all your favorite apps responsively.</p>
<p>Apple Intelligence integration takes the experience even further. It’s Apple’s personal AI system that lets you search, write, develop ideas, communicate, and create stuff with ease. You’re getting personalized tools for a bunch of tasks, which can help you get a lot more done throughout your day.</p>
<p>There’s a 16GB memory to keep things running smoothly. It’s not massive, but you should be able to perform some light multitasking with ease. Storage is taken care of by the built-in 256GB SSD. Again, it’s not the biggest out there, but it does a good job at housing all your important files and content in a single place.</p>



<p>The PC also includes Thunderbolt, HDMI, and Gigabit Ethernet ports on the back, plus, for the first time, front-facing USB-C ports and a headphone jack. These are enough to connect all your important peripherals without feeling limited. What’s more, the Mac mini plays nicely with other Apple devices like iPhones and iPads, too. When using it with your iPhone, for instance, you can mirror your smartphone on the monitor and control it from there. You can move things around, copy something on the iPhone and paste it on the Mac, reply to texts, take FaceTime calls, and more.</p>
<p>There are a lot of other features to like here, but to wrap it up, if you’ve been looking to upgrade your workstation by grabbing something fast and efficient, we highly recommend considering the 2024 Mac mini desktop computer. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4124/">It’s now going for $479, meaning you can save over $100 on your purchase, but only if you grab it quick.</a></p>

              <p data-start="0" data-end="483">How long has it been since you upgraded your laptop?

            <title><![CDATA[LEGO Rescues Your Christmas Gifts, Harry Potter Hogwarts Castle at Price That Crushes All Other Sets]]></title>
            <link>https://kotaku.com/lego-rescues-your-christmas-gifts-harry-potter-hogwarts-castle-at-price-that-crushes-all-other-sets-2000654166</link>

              <p>LEGO sets is a holiday gifting staple that works for kids and adults but as Christmas approaches, finding products that actually arrive before December 25th becomes increasingly critical. This <em>Hogwarts Castle and Grounds</em> building set <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4207/">currently sells for $140 on Amazon, down from its regular $169 price</a>, and more importantly, it ships with guaranteed delivery before Christmas through Amazon’s fast shipping network.</p>
<p>This 2,660-piece display model recreates the most iconic location from the Harry Potter universe in impressive detail which makes it perfect for adult collectors and Harry Potter fans.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4207/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Full Castle Recreation with Amazing Detail</h2>
<p>The model shows how complicated the architecture of Hogwarts Castle is by including the <strong>Main Tower, Astronomy Tower, Great Hall, several courtyards, bridges, greenhouses, the Boathouse, and even the Black Lake</strong>. Each part fits together to make a complete picture of the castle grounds that matches the size and layout fans know from the books and movies.</p>
<p>The castle’s interior details make famous places come to life, like the <strong>Chamber of Secrets</strong> with its snake-shaped architecture, the Winged Key room from the Philosopher’s Stone challenges, the Potions Classroom where Snape scared students, and the Chessboard Chamber with its checkered floor pattern. These hidden details are worth looking for closely, and they add depth to the model beyond its impressive shape.</p>



<p>The grounds around the castle add to the experience by including important parts of the larger Hogwarts setting. The Durmstrang Ship is ready to take students who are visiting, and the Beauxbatons Carriage is a nice touch that fits with the story of the Triwizard Tournament. The Whomping Willow is standing there with its unique twisted branches, and the crashed Ford Anglia is nearby as a nod to Chamber of Secrets.</p>



<p>One of the best things about the model is how good it looks: When finished, <strong>it is over 8.5 inches tall, 13.5 inches wide, and 10 inches deep</strong> and the castle stands out on a shelf, desk, or display area without taking up too much space or needing a whole bookcase to hold it. The gold-colored Hogwarts architect statue mini-figure that comes with it is the icing on the cake, and the <em>“Hogwarts Castle”</em> nameplate makes it a collectible display piece.</p>
<p>You’re saving here almost $30 on a big LEGO set that has a lot of pieces and detail for the price. In this size range, LEGO sets that are similar to castles or buildings usually cost the same or more, so this deal is a good deal for adults who like LEGO and the promise of delivery before Christmas takes away the stress of ordering gifts so close to the holiday.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[It’s Horrifying Just How Little Time Steam Users Spend Playing New Games]]></title>
            <link>https://kotaku.com/its-horrifying-just-how-little-time-steam-users-spend-playing-new-games-2000654158</link>
            <guid>1385929</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Just about every app you use will be serving up its own equivalent of Spotify Wrapped right about now. This morning the New York Times Puzzle app humiliated me with the news that I mostly solve yellow first in <em>Connections</em>, and my average&nbsp;<em>Wordle</em> guess rate is 3.97. Thanks for that. Also joining in once more is Steam, with its fourth annual Steam Replay, summarizing your year in PC gaming with fun stats and details on every game you played. And if you’re a part of the vast majority, that won’t be including any games from 2025. In fact, nearly half of you will have dodged games released since 2017.</p> <p>Alongside your own stats and details, <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/replay/">Steam Replay</a> measures you against the average Steam user, and in doing so reveals some extraordinary statistics about how people really play games. So where the page tells you about how many achievements you unlocked this year, it’ll compare that to the median of just 11, or how the average longest streak of days on which games are played is only 6. Then there’s the really astonishing fact that the median user of Steam plays just <em>four</em> games a year.</p>

 <p>Not “buys” but “plays.” And given the frequent Steam sales that mean squillions of games are available for as little as a dollar, and the ease with which multiple free games can be played, to get an average as low as four suggests <em>vast</em> numbers of Steam users are playing far, far fewer than that.</p>

 <p>Then comes perhaps the most shocking statistic. Where you’re told how much time you spent playing games released in 2025 (mine was 58 percent), you’re told that the average percentage is just 14. Of all the time all Steam users (estimated to be <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Steam/comments/1i4bez6/epyllion_estimates_steam_to_have_over_185m/">around 185 million people in September 2024</a>) play games, just a seventh is on a game from this year.</p>

 <p>But it gets more extraordinary. 40 percent of playtime from all Steam users is spent in games released eight or more years ago, with 44 percent spent in games one to seven years old. Now, that doesn’t directly correlate to 84 percent of people <em>only</em> playing ages-old games, but it demonstrates a strong bias toward them olden days. Given that <em>Counter-Strike 2</em>,&nbsp;<em>Dota 2</em>, and <em>PUGB</em> dominate the top of the Most Played Games data by some margin on a daily basis, perhaps this shouldn’t be quite so surprising, but it still feels bonkers.</p>

 <figure id="attachment_2000654167" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000654167"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000654167">© Steam / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p>These numbers do seem to swing around a little wildly. Last year it was 37 percent of time spent with eight-year-old games and 15 percent with new releases, and you might suggest it makes sense for this to have slightly shifted with a bunch more games slipping into the 8+-years-old range, but then jump back to 2022 and a colossal <em>64 percent</em> of time was spent with the oldest games, and only 19 percent on games from one to seven years back. Wild stuff.</p> <p>I’ve done my best to counter this with 205 games played, of which 183 were new in 2025, but then I’m perhaps rather cheating by this being my job. But seriously, people, there are&nbsp;<em>so</em> many great new games to try! Yes, get your&nbsp;<em>Dota</em> time in, but please make sure not to miss out on, you know, [broad sweeping gesture to the entirety of <em>Kotaku</em>‘s output].</p>
