Pitchford has since claimed that the game’s release date shifting has nothing to do with other games like <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/gta-6-release-october-borderlands-4-take-two-rockstar-1851764006&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/gta-6-release-october-borderlands-4-take-two-rockstar-1851764006"><em>Grand Theft Auto 6 </em>or <em>Marathon</em></a></span><em>. </em>Regardless, the looter shooter is coming out sooner than expected, and so it makes sense that Gearbox wanted to show it off via a new PlayStation State of Play.</p><p>On April 30,<span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://blog.playstation.com/2025/04/30/borderlands-4-revealing-vault-hunter-skills-new-planet-kairos-and-more/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/04/30/borderlands-4-revealing-vault-hunter-skills-new-planet-kairos-and-more/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"> Sony aired a 2o-minute gameplay deep dive into <em>Borderlands 4</em></a></span> in which we learned a lot more about the upcoming FPS. Here are 13 key pieces of information from the event.</p><hr><ul data-type="List" data-style="Bullet"><li>Pitchford claims <em>Borderlands 4 </em>is going to have a more “grounded tone” that harkens back to the original game.</li><li>Two of the new Vault Hunters in the game were given names and we learned more about them. Vex is a powerful Siren with a ghost-tiger that she can pet and use in combat. Rafa is a former Tediore soldier who uses advanced tech during fights. </li><li><em>Borderlands 4 </em>is set on Kairos, a new planet that was previously controlled and hidden by a mysterious alien being known as the Timekeeper. Some years before the game started, however, a rogue moon crashed into the planet and caused a ton of chaos. (OG character Lilith might have been involved in that...) </li><li>The looter shooter will support crossplay at launch. It will also let you play two-player split screen c0-op. While playing with others you’ll be able to set your own difficulty and all loot will be instanced, so no gun stealing between friends. </li><li>Kairos will feature four massive zones that players can explore freely with  no loading screens. In the mission we saw during the demo, the new hunters were infiltrating a secret blacksite research facility alongside <em>Borderlands 3</em> character Armata. </li><li>You can now glide across large gaps and use your zipline on certain points in exploration or during combat. Gearbox confirmed that sliding, double jumping and dashing are back, too. </li><li>Players will have access to a “Digirunner,” a vehicle which looks a lot like a Sparrow from <em>Destiny</em>. These are single-seat hovercraft that you can spawn into at any point while out in the world. </li><li>While exploring Kairos you’ll discover silos. These are locations that aren’t tied to side quests, but function more like the kinds of activities you might seen in a big open-world game like <em>Assassin’s Creed. </em></li><li>Most of the weapon manufactures from past games, like Tediore and Jakobs, are back. But this time around guns can spawn with “Licensed Parts.” So a Jakobs rifle might have a different brand of scope or barrel, which might change how it fires or the kind of damage it does. This will make the already wildly unique loot you find in <em>Borderlands</em> games even more varied. </li><li>Speaking of loot, Gearbox has reworked how often rare loot drops and promises that Legendaries will be rarer and more powerful than in <em>Borderlands 3</em>. You’ll also be able to unlock enhancements that can make certain weapon brands more powerful. </li><li><em>Borderlands 4 </em>will feature repayable missions and boss fights, which should make it easier than ever to grind for specific loot.</li></ul><p>So yeah, we learned a lot of about <em>Borderlands 4</em>! And I’m excited to see more of the game between now and its (earlier than planned) launch of September 12. <em>Borderlands 4</em> is set to arrive on PS5, Xbox Series X/S, PC, and Switch 2.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

I called it one of the best games in the series and the best-looking open-world game I’ve ever played. Set in feudal Japan, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/ubisoft-assassins-creed-shadows-delay-march-february-1851736266&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/ubisoft-assassins-creed-shadows-delay-march-february-1851736266"><em>Shadows</em></a></span> quickly became the second best-selling game of the year so far. And now, after the dust has settled, Ubisoft has revealed a months-long roadmap that includes new features, quests, options, gear, and even big parkour improvements. </p><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.ubisoft.com/en-us/game/assassins-creed/news/3rJiU861lAyWTYpvH3cfmY/assassins-creed-shadows-post-launch-roadmap-update-a-first-look-at-whats-coming-next&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.ubisoft.com/en-us/game/assassins-creed/news/3rJiU861lAyWTYpvH3cfmY/assassins-creed-shadows-post-launch-roadmap-update-a-first-look-at-whats-coming-next" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">On Wednesday</a></span>, Ubisoft published a short video detailing all the upcoming content and updates planned for <em>Assassin’s Creed Shadows. </em>Most of the updates will be completely free, including a planned series of regular “Story Drops” that will add new quests, abilities, and activities while also providing more backstory for fan-favorite side characters. The first one lands in early May. </p><p>For fans of doing sick parkour leaps across buildings and up walls, Ubisoft is improving your parkour toolbox in a later May update that will add height-gaining back-ejects, fully re-animated height-gaining side-ejects, and a completely new parkour move called the Vertical Ledge Jump. This last one will let both characters jump straight up to grab low overhangs without needing a wall. Ubisoft also promises that “more little parkour tricks and improvements” will be added throughout 2025.</p><p>Another part of <em> Shadows’ </em>roadmap is a series of community-focused updates adding content and options based directly on player feedback, including the ability to toggle different in-game filters on and off as well as certain visual effects and character headgear during cutscenes.</p><figure id="" data-id="61b78b3ae42d610fbddc5875629509c2" data-recommend-id="image://61b78b3ae42d610fbddc5875629509c2" data-format="jpg" data-width="960" data-height="540" data-lightbox="true" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Ubisoft</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="61b78b3ae42d610fbddc5875629509c2" data-recommend-id="image://61b78b3ae42d610fbddc5875629509c2" data-format="jpg" data-width="960" data-height="540" data-lightbox="true" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Ubisoft also says it has more surprises to reveal in the future and that this roadmap isn’t everything it has planned, but just the highlights that they wanted to let fans know about.  </p><p>Lastly, <em>Assassin’s Creed Shadows</em> will receive its first paid expansion—<em>Claws Of Awaji</em>—later this year, seemingly sometime after June. It will add a new region to the world as well as a new weapon for Naoi: A bow staff.</p><p>That’s a lot of content and updates! It sounds like come this time next year—assuming Ubisoft sticks to this schedule—<em>Asssassin’s Creed Shadows </em>will be a much bigger and better game, which is impressive considering how excellent the game was at launch last month.</p><p> .<br></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
