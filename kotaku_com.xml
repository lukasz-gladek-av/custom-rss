As a result, I’m very excited to play <em>Bananza</em>. It looks awesome, letting DK punch and destroy everything. It also co-stars a young Pauline, who is DK’s companion in the game, riding on his shoulder and using her singing ability to help the big ape solve puzzles and destroy more stuff. I think that inclusion alone wouldn’t have broken too many people’s brains, but at one point in the Direct we briefly see Donkey Kong and young Pauline interact with Cranky Kong. And that has caused <em>chaos</em> among Nintendo lore nerds.</p><figure id="" data-id="349d77c430ac9deebe35516ebaf943a8" data-recommend-id="image://349d77c430ac9deebe35516ebaf943a8" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Screenshot of YouTube comments debating DK Bananza's place in the lore.

So seeing Pauline as a child hanging out with an aged Cranky Kong makes it hard for wiki editors and super fans to figure out how to connect <em>Bananza </em>to the other <em>Mario </em>and <em>Donkey Kong</em> games.</p><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://youtu.be/YVUidGTR8xg&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://youtu.be/YVUidGTR8xg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Over on YouTube</a></span>, there are literally hundreds of comments from many people debating how to make the lore work. </p><p>Some speculate that <em>Bananza</em> is retconning the original game.

" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>I found one YouTube comment that was over 1,300 words long and dug deep into the canonical <em>Mario </em>and<em> Donkey Kong</em> games and <em>Bananza’s </em>place in that timeline and the problems it creates.</p><h2 id="h1028408"><a id=""></a>How A Young Pauline Can Meet Cranky Kong In <em>Bananza</em></h2><p>I want to help you all. So, here’s the answer you’ve been looking for. Here’s why and how Pauline, as a kid, is talking to Cranky Kong. You ready? Here you go: Nintendo doesn’t care about lore and just wants to make fun games. That’s it. Simple as that. </p><p>And honestly, that’s so nice. I love it so much. Truly, Nintendo devs couldn’t care less about canon, timelines, and <em>Donkey Kong</em> lore. They just make great games that make you smile. The company doesn’t let decades of backstory impede its ability to be creative and do new things. Pauline is a kid in this game because the people making <em>Bananza</em> thought it would be a fun idea, and Nintendo agreed. </p><p>Besides, the <em>Donkey Kong</em> lore is a mess anyway. Cranky Kong’s appearance in the Direct is seen by many as a smoking gun that reveals <em>Bananza</em> to be a reboot or a time travel story. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.mariowiki.com/Cranky_Kong#Identity_confusion:~:text=Rareware%20initially%20created,List%20of%20appearances&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.mariowiki.com/Cranky_Kong#Identity_confusion:~:text=Rareware%20initially%20created,List%20of%20appearances" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">But on the <em>Mario</em> Wiki page for Cranky, you’ll find a nearly 800-word section</a></span> about how his connection to Donkey Kong has never been consistent. Sometimes he’s DK’s grandpa, sometimes he’s DK’s dad, sometimes he might not even be related. Sometimes Nintendo has acknowledged this nonsense; other times, they just treat the current Donkey Kong as the sole big ape that long ago kidnapped Pauline. None of this has <em>ever </em>been nailed down consistently, and acting like it has is silly!</p><p>Look, I get it. I love <em>Star Wars</em> lore. I get nerdy about it, too. I’m not trying to say people can’t have fun. But far too many of the comments I’ve seen about this <em>Bananza</em> lore debate seem to be taking it far too seriously, as if Nintendo is vindictively shitting on Rare’s legacy. That doesn’t make sense considering all the references to Rare’s<em> DK Country </em>games included in the Direct. </p><p>The thing about lore is that it’s fun to ponder and discuss, but it should never be allowed to completely derail anyone’s ability to tell a new story or make something cool with classic characters. <em>Donkey Kong Bananza</em> seems like a blast. Don’t let the lore get in the way of that. </p><p> .</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Marvel beat-em-ups definitely had a moment in the ‘90s, with standouts like the <em>X-Men</em> arcade game. It’s been a while since we got one as modern as <em>Cosmic Invasion</em> feels, though it draws more heavily from the classic aesthetics of old Marvel comics than from anything you’ll see on a theater screen. Given the team’s pedigree, it’s no surprise that its take on Marvel is as stylish and satisfying as it is. <em>Cosmic Invasion </em>has you and a friend each pick two heroes to swap between on the fly as you knock around alien forces invading Earth. In the roughly 30 minutes I played, I chose to fight as Captain America and Wolverine. The two heroes specialize primarily in close-quarters combat, but America’s Ass could also perform some ranged attacks by throwing his shield. Wolfie’s attacks were far more vicious. I could latch onto enemies and gut them with my claws, almost like a grappler character in a fighting game. Those distinct differences, even between characters you’d guess would have similar playstyles, are what keep <em>Cosmic Invasion </em>from becoming a monotonous chore.</p><p>The beat-em-up genre is always toeing the line between mindless brawling and cathartic mayhem, and in my limited time with it, <em>Cosmic Invasion </em>kept me on my toes. Its waves of enemies are varied enough that a simple one-button combo wasn’t always going to do the trick, and each time I played as a different character, my strategies changed up pretty substantially. When I played as Spider-Man in a second run, the hero’s webswinging helped me get across the battlefield more quickly and deliver a devastating blow to enemies on the other side of the screen. Playing as flying characters like the weather-manipulating Storm made taking down airborne enemies a breeze, where land-locked heroes might have struggled with those pests. </p><p>Playing alongside a competent teammate also kept things interesting, as my player two and I would often juggle enemies back and forth between us like we were hackeysacking them, sometimes into environmental hazards like holes in the floor. Every so often, I would find myself falling into a rhythm of the same combos and strategies, but then a cool, unscripted moment like this would bring me back. Swapping between heroes at any time also kept me alert. If I started to get too comfortable with Captain America, I could switch to Wolverine and do something a little different. I enjoy beat-em-ups, but the genre has a lot of repetitive pitfalls that games in it can easily fall into. Thankfully, <em>Cosmic Invasion </em>has a lot of systems in place to try and alleviate those as much as possible.</p><p>While yes, I’m looking forward to the big stuff Marvel is putting out in the video game space, it’s also nice to play something a bit more simple and evocative of classic comic-book stories, and which employs a vibrant aesthetic that sometimes feels like it’s missing from most modern Marvel. Tribute Games is great at capturing a moment in time, and <em>Cosmic Invasion </em>is the kind of palate-cleansing throwback that reminds you that Marvel wasn’t always the biggest-budget entertainment property on the planet; once upon a time, you were more likely to see Captain America beating up some baddies as you fought alongside a friend at an arcade cabinet than to see him onscreen at your local multiplex. I’m looking forward to seeing if the game holds up over several hours when it launches on PC, Switch, PS4, PS5, and Xbox later this year.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

This game has a much wackier tone than <em>Control</em>. Whereas <em>Control</em> had protagonist Jesse Faden explore the psychological and supernatural elements of the Oldest House, here you and some friends play as a bunch of no-name workers in <em>FBC: Firebreak</em> tasked with responding to emergencies and clearing out enemies called the Hiss while fixing up various contraptions. </p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="195670" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="This Stylish Noir-Punk Side-Scroller Is Like Celeste With Guns" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="184" data-playlist="195670,195922,195928" data-current="195670"><div><p>This Stylish Noir-Punk Side-Scroller Is Like Celeste With Guns</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195670/195670_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195670/195670_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195670/195670_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195670/195670_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/21167.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>Together, a squad of three must tackle the game’s various objectives and level up skills to rise through the ranks. Here are some tips to complete the tasks on your to-do list and impress your boss.</p><h2 id="h35452"><a id=""></a>Avoid playing solo</h2><p><em>FBC: Firebreak</em> surprisingly has quite a lot in common with <em>Elden Ring Nightreign</em>. You can play in squads up to three, and both games really encourage communication and coordination. They both even have no in-game voice chat! <em>FBC: Firebreak</em> at least has cross-platform play, though.</p><p>While the game can be played solo, it’s much more fun with other players at your side. It can be very difficult to complete certain tasks like fixing machines and fighting off enemies simultaneously. Having teammates means that you can also diversify and synergize the different abilities that the game’s Crisis Kits offer, leading to faster and successful outcomes</p><p>Going solo means you’re much more likely to just get downed. Speaking of being downed, your teammates can revive you and you won’t have to waste a life by respawning if you were playing solo.</p><h2 id="h35453"><a id=""></a>Familiarize yourself with the Crisis Kits</h2><p>Crisis Kits are Firebreak’s form of classes. So far, there are three: Fix, Jump, and Splash.</p><p><strong>The Fix Kit is a close-range melee fighting specialist who comes equipped with a giant wrench and shotgun to fight off enemies</strong>. The wrench does a pathetic amount of damage, but it can be used to fix machines with a wrench icon like showers and skip a mini-game. Fix Kits also come with a turret and the AI16 Piggy Altered Augment that conjures up a coin twister to hit enemies.</p><p><strong>The Jump Kit focuses more on enemy crowd control and management.</strong> Its giant Electro-Kinetic Charge Impactor lets it quickly jump start certain machines such as showers and ammo closets that can help your teammates in a pinch. This Crisis Kit comes with a boombox that draws in enemies before blowing up, as well as the AI19 Garden Gnome Altered Augment that calls forth bolts of lightning to rain down on enemies.</p><figure id="" data-id="4939a194486392c562bf2b83dc02f72d" data-recommend-id="image://4939a194486392c562bf2b83dc02f72d" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="720" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A screenshot shows the Splash Kit." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A screenshot shows the Splash Kit." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Remedy / George Yang / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="4939a194486392c562bf2b83dc02f72d" data-recommend-id="image://4939a194486392c562bf2b83dc02f72d" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="720" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A screenshot shows the Splash Kit." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p><strong>The Splash Kit plays more like a typical support class with its water-based abilities.</strong> The Crank-Operated Fluidic Ejector can rinse teammates and get rid of negative status effects like fire. It can also inflict the “wet” status effect on enemies, which synergizes incredibly well with Jump Kits and their ability to shock them with the Electro-Kinetic Charge. This Kit also carries the AI44 Teapot Altered Augment that heats up water and fires them at enemies, scalding them for extra damage.</p><h2 id="h35454"><a id=""></a>Familiarize yourself with the different Job Sites</h2><p>So far, the game has five different Job Sites. Each contains their own unique settings and objectives. Knowing which job you’re taking on can inform what kind of Kits to bring along to efficiently finish your tasks.</p><figure id="" data-id="f5d1d3dd9f8c6a09ce1db96bd4571459" data-recommend-id="image://f5d1d3dd9f8c6a09ce1db96bd4571459" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="720" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A screenshot shows different jobs." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A screenshot shows different jobs." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Remedy / George Yang / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="f5d1d3dd9f8c6a09ce1db96bd4571459" data-recommend-id="image://f5d1d3dd9f8c6a09ce1db96bd4571459" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="720" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A screenshot shows different jobs." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Hot Fix has your squad fixing fans and making sure the furnace doesn’t burn the entire place down. Paper Chase requires your squad to destroy a bunch of sticky notes scattered throughout the entire area. The Splash Kit does wonders in both sites, as the former will be VERY hot and you’ll likely suffer from burns, which a Splash Kit can help relieve. In the latter, Splash Kits can make the sticky notes wet, and the Jump Kit can destroy them by shocking them.</p><p>Ground Control is much more straightforward, where you’ll just have to kill a bunch of insects to drop their pearls, which then need to be transferred. Frequency Shift is also quite straightforward. Pink goo has infested the entire area and your teammates must get rid of it. However, you have to be careful as the goo can explode and hurt you.</p><p>The final Job Site is Freezer Duty, which sees your squad turning on heaters to melt down the ice covering the area. In particular, the Jump Kit is helpful here as it can quickly jump start the heaters.</p><h2 id="h35455"><a id=""></a>Collect Research Samples and Lost Assets regularly</h2><p>Throughout various Job Sites, you’ll come across Lost Assets and Research Samples around the area, especially on the ground. You’ll want to pick them up, as they’re needed to unlock perks and upgrade your tools. </p><p>Lost Assets look like stationary, such as clipboards, paper, and folders, while Research Samples usually look like piles of colored powder. <strong>This is the game’s form of permanent progression</strong> as you prepare to tackle harder difficulties and continue through higher Clearance, Threat, and Corruption levels.</p><figure id="" data-id="1813669b5389855c8e5bce6eaef1bcb9" data-recommend-id="image://1813669b5389855c8e5bce6eaef1bcb9" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="720" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A screenshot shows various perks in FBC: Firebreak." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A screenshot shows various perks in FBC: Firebreak." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Remedy / George Yang / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="1813669b5389855c8e5bce6eaef1bcb9" data-recommend-id="image://1813669b5389855c8e5bce6eaef1bcb9" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="720" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A screenshot shows various perks in FBC: Firebreak." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Lost Assets can be found at any of the Job Sites, but specific Research Samples can only be found at certain Job Sites. Additionally, you’ll need to turn on at least one level of Corruption for any Research Samples to show up at all.</p><ul data-type="List" data-style="Bullet"><li>Hot Fix has Whispering Ash samples</li><li>Paper Chase has Viscous Strip samples</li><li>Ground Control has Achromatic Sand samples</li><li>Frequency Shift has Resonant Glob samples</li><li>Freezer Duty has Numbed Splinters samples</li></ul><p>Make sure to actually finish the Job and extract from the elevator after your objective is done, as you won’t be able to take anything with you if you fail the entire mission.</p><hr><p><br><em>FBC: Firebreak</em> is now available on PC, PS5, and Xbox Series X/S.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
