While on court, a woman read their Christmas letters to Santa and handed out gifts. One kid, who worked <em>really </em>hard to get good grades this year, wanted a <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/playstation-5-the-kotaku-review-1845588904&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/playstation-5-the-kotaku-review-1845588904">PlayStation 5</a></span> console. And that’s what the kid got. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://x.com/StanUsmnt/status/1868854508102803654&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://x.com/StanUsmnt/status/1868854508102803654" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">You can see how happy he is in the video below</a></span>. But that video also claims that after halftime, staff took away the PS5 and replaced it with a jersey. </p><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.boston25news.com/news/national/hornets-apologize/PWWEP5OU5PE76JIMXXOKDX36FM&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.boston25news.com/news/national/hornets-apologize/PWWEP5OU5PE76JIMXXOKDX36FM" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>Boston 25 </em>explained</a></span> that cheerleaders and other people involved in the halftime event were reportedly confused when staff took away the kid’s PS5 gift. Apparently, the child’s uncle, likely the adult in the grey and blue hoodie in the video above, knew ahead of time that the gift would be taken away and failed to share that info with his nephew.</p><p>As you might expect, a team worth billions cheaping out and taking away a kid’s Christmas gift after pretending to give it to him in front of cameras didn’t go over well online. People rightfully called out the team and its staff for the horrible prank, and within 24 hours the Hornets issued an apology. </p><p>On Tuesday, the team said its “on-court skit...missed the mark” and blamed it on “bad decision making and poor communication.” </p><p><em>“</em>Simply put, we turned the ball over and we apologize. We have reached out to the family and are committed to not only making it right but to exceeding expectations,” <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://x.com/NickCarboniWCNC/status/1869132751464747392&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://x.com/NickCarboniWCNC/status/1869132751464747392" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">said the team in a statement shared by reporter Nick Carboni</a></span>. </p><p>“We will be providing the fan with the PS5 that he should have taken home last night along with a VIP experience to a future game. Our goal is and will remain to elevate the guest experience for every person that enters Spectrum Center, and to show our fans how much we appreciate their relentless support.”</p><p>And if you were wondering: The Hornets received karmic justice Monday night after taking away the kid’s PS5. The team went on to lose 121-108 to the Sixers. </p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

And this new tech, which is impressive looking, ain’t cheap. LG’s first transparent TV will cost you an eye-watering $60,000. You can pre-order one now, if you have that kind of cash lying around. The futuristic TVs will start shipping to customers in January. Sorry, you can’t get this for someone as a last-minute Christmas gift. </p><p>Another interesting piece of tech in this new TV is a wireless box that transmits any connected devices, like a PS5 or DVD player, to the screen without any wires. You just plug your consoles or whatever into the black box at the bottom of the TV and that’s it. Sounds neat and looks nice, but I do wonder how much delay it adds and if I would notice it while playing something like <em>Fortnite</em>. Sounds like something I need to test out! LG, send me one of these transparent future TVs ASAP! Or maybe I can convince <em>Kotaku </em>to buy me one for review purposes.

Ultimate</em>. Gioeli alleges he wasn’t rightly compensated for these and other uses of the song.</p><p>Gioeli says in the lawsuit that he has personally “maintained and registered” the song with licensing agency BMI, and also <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://publicrecords.copyright.gov/detailed-record/36292721&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://publicrecords.copyright.gov/detailed-record/36292721" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">holds the copyright</a></span> that lists him as the author that holds the rights and permissions for the composition and lyrics. According to the lawsuit, Gioeli says he was only aware “Live &amp; Learn” had been used in the original release of <em>Sonic Adventure 2</em>, and was only clued into all the other times it had been used by a fan in 2024.</p><p>Gioeli is looking to the court for clarity on who owns the masters of the original song and is seeking compensation for all the uses of the song beyond those in <em>Sonic Adventure 2</em>. Gioeli confirmed earlier this year that he had signed a deal with Paramount allowing the use of “Live &amp; Learn” in <em>Sonic the Hedgehog 3</em>. He has been in contact with at least two lawyers regarding the dispute, one from Sega who told him he didn’t have rights to the song, and another who allegedly called the song a “joint work,” making Gioeli entitled to “50 percent of Sega’s profits” from the song. The singer’s lawyer says that damages would include $500,000, along with at least another $500,000 for unpaid royalties.</p><p>In a statement to <em>Polygon</em>, Gioeli said he wants to maintain his relationship with Sega and doesn’t want this to sully the memories fans have made with Crush 40’s music.</p><p>“I have no comment other than my desire to maintain the preservation of a long standing beautiful relationship with Sega,” Gioeli said in his statement to <em>Polygon</em>. “I do not want fans to draw conclusions or be disrupted from the beautiful memories we have made collectively with this music. I believe and hope we will come to a peaceful settlement that will be fair and just.”</p><p>Crush 40 have been featured in several <em>Sonic</em> games since the original <em>Sonic Adventure</em>, having contributed music to games like <em>Sonic Heroes</em>, <em>Shadow the Hedgehog</em>, and <em>Sonic and the Black Knight</em>. Though their contributions to the series have become more scarce in recent years, their music has been re-used in several games, including this year’s <em>Shadow Generations</em>. </p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
