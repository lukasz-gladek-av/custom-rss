              <p><span>Adding </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/overwatch-2-spotlight-story-vendetta-cinematic-new-heroes-2000665327"><span>five new heroes in one drop</span></a><span> was always going to be a balancing challenge, but Blizzard has managed to patch in some nerfs for all five of </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/overwatch-2-spotlight-new-heroes-perks-stadium-returning-2000665736"><i><span>Overwatch</span></i><span>’s</span></a><span> added heroes just a few days after they launched. It’s all pretty standard turning knobs and flipping switches, though I fear there’s nothing in here that’s going to make anyone who </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/overwatch-jetpack-cat-competitive-ranked-hero-bans-fika-2000668681"><span>hates the chaotic menace that is Jetpack Cat</span></a><span> any happier.</span></p> <p><span>The </span><a href="https://overwatch.blizzard.com/en-us/news/patch-notes/?blzcmp=app"><span>patch notes</span></a><span> aren’t that extensive, as the update seems to be mostly targeting a few pain points in Domina, </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/overwatch-anran-face-comparison-change-voice-fareeha-2000666873"><span>Anran</span></a><span>, Emre, Jetpack Cat, and Mizuki’s kits. </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/overwatch-2-vendetta-reveal-trailer-cinematic-video-2000644926"><span>Vendetta</span></a><span> is also here, and since she was the last hero to join the roster before the big reboot, it makes sense she might still need some tinkering. It’s not all nerfs, though, as Anran and Mizuki have a few buffs in the mix. The full change log is as follows:</span></p>

 <h2><b>Domina</b></h2> <ul> <li aria-level="1"><span>Barrier Array</span></li> </ul> <p><span>Barrier Panel Health reduced from 250 to 225</span></p> <h2><b>Anran</b></h2> <ul> <li aria-level="1"><span>Zhuque Fans</span></li> </ul> <p><span>Impact damage increased from 20 to 22.</span></p> <ul> <li aria-level="1"><span>Fan the Flames</span></li> </ul> <p><span>Impact damage now uses beam damage against armor mitigation (Only reduced by 30% when used on armor).</span></p> <ul> <li aria-level="1"><span>Inferno Rush</span></li> </ul> <p><span>Can now be canceled with quick melee.</span></p> <ul> <li aria-level="1"><span>Ignition – Passive</span></li> </ul> <p><span>Burning build up linger time increased from 3 to 4 seconds.</span></p> <h2><b>Emre</b></h2> <ul> <li aria-level="1"><span>Synthetic Burst Rifle – Take Aim</span></li> </ul> <p><span>Falloff range increased from 30-45 to 35-50 meters.</span></p> <ul> <li aria-level="1"><span>Cyber Frag</span></li> </ul> <p><span>Explosion damage minimum radius increased from 1.25 to 2 meters.</span></p> <h2><b>Jetpack Cat</b></h2> <ul> <li aria-level="1"><span>Frenetic Flight</span></li> </ul> <p><span>Regeneration rate reduced from 30 to 25.</span></p> <h2><b>Mizuki</b></h2> <ul> <li aria-level="1"><span>Spirit Glaive</span></li> </ul> <p><span>Cast time reduced from 0.1 to 0.025 seconds.</span></p> <p><span>Recovery time increased from 0.7 to 0.75 seconds.</span></p> <ul> <li aria-level="1"><span>Healing Kasa</span></li> </ul> <p><span>Range increased from 25 to 30 meters.</span></p> <p><span>Default soft targeting range increased from 8 to 10 degrees.</span></p> <ul> <li aria-level="1"><span>Ultimate</span></li> </ul> <p><span>Ultimate cost increased by 7%.</span></p> <p><span>Now heals for 100 instant healing on cast.</span></p> <h2><b>Vendetta</b></h2> <p><span>Siphoning Strike – Minor Perk</span></p> <p><span>Lifesteal reduced from 40% to 30%.</span></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Robotaxi car company Waymo and food delivery app DoorDash confirmed that, yes, they are working together to send people out to close car doors left open by careless riders. We live in a sad and horrible future.</p> <p>Earlier this week, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/DoorDash_Dasher/comments/1r170zc/craziest_offer/">a Reddit post from a DoorDash driver went semi-viral</a> as it seemingly showed the app offering the user $6.25 to go drive a few blocks and close a Waymo door that was left open. Once the task was completed and verified, the driver would be paid an additional $5. The user had never seen an offer like this before and asked others if they had been asked to go close a robotaxi’s door. Some even wondered if the driver was faking the order entirely for some odd reason. But nope, this is real.</p>   <p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2026/02/12/waymo-is-asking-doordash-drivers-to-shut-the-doors-of-its-self-driving-cars/"><em>TechCrunch</em> reached out</a>&nbsp;to Waymo and DoorDash about the post, and the two companies confirmed they are indeed working together and paying people to close doors.</p> <p>“Waymo is currently running a pilot program in Atlanta to enhance its AV fleet efficiency. In the rare event a vehicle door is left ajar, preventing the car from departing, nearby Dashers are notified, allowing Waymo to get its vehicles back on the road quickly,” said the companies in a joint statement.</p>

 <p>Yes, this means that DoorDashers are getting paid to close doors on vehicles that are designed to one day replace them and other drivers completely. But hey, $11 is nice, I guess. And maybe the robots will remember the ones who closed the doors for them and be nicer to them when they run everything.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Dang, The Wait For KPop Demon Hunters 2 Is Gonna Be Longer Than We Thought]]></title>
            <link>https://kotaku.com/kpop-demon-hunters-2-sequel-release-date-netflix-songs-2000668712</link>
            <guid>1435588</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/kpop-demon-hunters-best-worst-songs-soundtrack-ranking-2000616633"><i><span>KPop Demon Hunters</span></i></a> <span>is </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/kpop-demon-hunters-2-sequel-netflix-release-date-2029-2000641414"><span>getting a sequel</span></a><span>, and since it’s going to take a long time to animate, it’s going to take a long time before it eventually arrives on Netflix. For a time, the movie was projected to come out in 2029, a good four years after </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/kpop-demon-hunters-streaming-box-office-numbers-netflix-2000622381"><span>the original blew up last year</span></a><span>. But now, it sounds like it might take even longer than that.</span></p> <p><span>In an interview with </span><a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/movies/movie-features/sony-kpop-demon-hunters-2-spider-verse-pressure-3-goat-1236503016/"><i><span>The Hollywood Reporter</span></i></a><span>, Sony Pictures Animation president Kristine Belson didn’t say much about </span><i><span>KPop Demon Hunters 2</span></i><span>, but did heavily imply that the planned 2029 date is probably not going to pan out. When </span><i><span>THR</span></i><span> said that a 2029 release seemed “far-fetched,” Belson responded by, as the outlet describes, placing “her pointer finger to her nose, to indicate that’s correct thinking.” Could we be waiting until 2030? 2031? That’s brutal.</span></p>

 <p><span>From the sound of it, even in these very early stages the team has been so busy during awards season that directors Maggie Kang and Chris Appelhans have had little time to buckle down on the project. </span><i><span>KPop Demon Hunters </span></i><span>has been doing very well at award shows, with wins at the Academy Awards and the Grammys, among many others. I guess all that flying back and forth between different events does have a way of complicating things. Larian expressed </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/baldurs-gate-3-too-many-awards-winning-larian-goty-1851593323"><span>a similar sentiment when </span><i><span>Baldur’s Gate 3 </span></i><span>was winning a bunch of awards</span></a><span> after it launched in 2023, which had staff out of the office and at award shows so much it got in the way of the studio’s work.</span></p> <p><i><span>KPop Demon Hunters 2 </span></i><span>has a lot of potential threads to follow whenever it does eventually come out. The first movie doesn’t end on a cliffhanger, per se, but </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/kpop-demon-hunters-2-sequel-theories-questions-netflix-2000620717"><span>there are a lot of character beats it only briefly touches on</span></a><span> that could be expanded into a full-blown sequel. </span></p>
