            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><span>A subset of </span><i><span>Stranger Things </span></i><span>fans </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/stranger-things-season-5-finale-reaction-byler-acting-2000656424"><span>unsatisfied with the horror series’ finale</span></a><span> have spent the last week </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/stranger-things-season-5-finale-matt-duffer-interview-2000656663"><span>dunking on the creators and actors</span></a><span> and also peddling a conspiracy theory that </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/stranger-things-secret-finale-conformity-gate-explained-2000656704"><span>Netflix was holding a secret finale episode</span></a><span> that would explain away things these fans didn’t like about the existing conclusion. According to the “Conformity Gate” theory, the ninth episode of </span><i><span>Stranger Things</span></i><span>’ fifth season was supposed to go live on the streaming service last night, January 7, at 8 p.m. ET. The theory had become so widespread that fans claim Netflix </span><a href="https://ftw.usatoday.com/story/entertainment/pop-culture/2026/01/07/stranger-things-conformity-gate-crashed-netflix/88073821007/"><span>crashed around this time</span></a><span> as fans flocked to the streaming service and overloaded the servers. When they finally managed to get the app to boot up, they found that no such ninth episode had been published.</span></p>   <p><span>While the Conformity Gate theory was an interesting thought experiment, and I’ll admit I watched enough videos about it that I wasn’t quite convinced but was at least willing to see it all play out, this turn of events was hardly surprising, especially after </span><a href="https://variety.com/2026/tv/news/stranger-things-conformity-gate-final-episode-doesnt-exist-1236625074/"><i><span>Variety</span></i></a><span> published a story hours ahead of the supposed launch debunking the theory.</span></p>

 <p><span>What is surprising, however, is just how far reaching Conformity Gate had become before it was inevitably disproven. Some corporate accounts, like the one belonging to the Empire State Building of all things, were posting about </span><i><span>Stranger Things</span></i><span> fans’ collective psychosis, whether in genuine support of the theory or just to take advantage of a trending topic for social media engagement. The Slim Jim account </span><a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@matcrackz/video/7592796861153414413"><span>is in everyone’s comments</span></a><span> like Joyce Byers telling everyone the Conformity Gate theory is canon, to them.</span></p>

   <p><span>Perhaps the interest of brands is understandable, though, in light of what a phenomenon </span><i><span>Stranger Things </span></i><span>was right up through its final episode.. The fifth season has already cracked </span><a href="https://www.netflix.com/tudum/top10/most-popular/tv"><span>Netflix’s top 10 all-time most-streamed series</span></a><span>, and even if some fans online are so unsatisfied with how it all ended that they’re imagining another episode that might fix it all, the series still has enough cultural cache that every social media manager is probably looking at Conformity Gate as a chance to ride the coattails of a trend. Now, however, even people who are actually part of the </span><i><span>Stranger Things </span></i><span>brand are starting to post about it, and sorry to those holding out hope, but the few times that people like actor Brett Gelman have acknowledged the conspiracy, it hasn’t been to confirm it. Here he is addressing Conformity Gate by name while lipsyncing a cover of Prince’s “When Doves Cry,” specifically the line “Maybe you’re just like my mother, she’s never satisfied.”</span></p>

   <p><span>The </span><i><span>Stranger Things</span></i> <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@strangerthings"><span>social media accounts</span></a><span> also now have “ALL EPISODES OF STRANGER THINGS ARE NOW PLAYING” </span><a href="https://x.com/Stranger_Things"><span>in their bios</span></a><span>, and it doesn’t get much clearer than that. The X account allegedly responsible for starting the conspiracy, @67gate, has set their profile to private. Now that the dream seems to be truly dead, fans are reacting in a lot of ways. Some are grieving, finally realizing the ending they didn’t like is, in fact, the finale of </span><i><span>Stranger Things</span></i><span>, while others are saying that the theory provided a fun ride for a week, and helped cushion the blow of the finale.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><span>Unfortunately, if you scroll through the comments on videos about there being no ninth episode, you’ll also find people moving the goalpost and saying that a secret finale could still be coming, whether that be after the upcoming </span><i><span>One Last Adventure </span></i><span>documentary about the making of the final season, or at some other date they made up. Maybe they will return to reality in the coming days as more people disperse from the discussion.</span></p>

That about sums it up, but if you’re tuned into enough fandoms, you’ve probably seen people clowning like this. I lived through the spread of the </span><i><span>Mass Effect 3 </span></i><span>Indoctrination Theory years ago, and I’m sure, despite this idea of a “secret finale which will reveal that the bad ending was just a nightmare we’re all going to wake up from” having never actually proven true, we’ll live through a Conformity Gate moment again in a few years.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><span>Taylor Swift fans are also notorious for </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/taylor-swift-life-of-a-showgirl-announcement-cover-date-2000617177"><span>looking for clues where there are none</span></a><span>, such as when they speculated for months that a re-recorded “Taylor’s Version” of the artist’s </span><i><span>Reputation </span></i><span>album was imminent based on small hints, only for Swift to reveal months later that she’d </span><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20250531031134/https://www.taylorswift.com/"><span>barely recorded any of the tracks</span></a><span> for a re-release. Theorycrafting is fun, but when you stake this level of an emotional claim in it, you’re dooming yourself to devastating disappointment. </span></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>If upgrading your audio gear is on your New Year’s checklist, this deal is hard to beat. The Bose QuietComfort Ultra Earbuds are widely praised for their exceptional noise cancellation, immersive sound quality, and all-day comfort, making them a great choice in the premium earbuds category. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6592/">Right now, Amazon is offering them at a $49 discount, dropping the price from their usual $299 down to just $250 for a limited time</a>. Whether you’re tuning out distractions during your daily commute, staying focused while working, traveling, or simply enjoying your favorite playlists at home without the whine of your toddler crying in the other room (they just never stop, don’t they?), these earbuds deliver a noticeably superior listening experience. If you’ve been waiting for the right moment to invest in high-quality audio, this limited-time offer makes now an excellent opportunity to do so for less.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6592/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>World-Class Noise Cancellation</h2>
<p>When paying for a premium audio accessory, you expect solid noise cancellation—and it’s the real deal here. Our sister-site <a href="https://gizmodo.com/bose-quietcomfort-ultra-2-review-the-only-earbuds-you-want-on-an-airplane-2000646784">Gizmodo</a> put it through the ringer, testing the second-gen Bose QuietComfort Ultra earbuds in busy subways and crowded, chatty coffee shops. The results were it could block out&nbsp;<em>everything</em>.</p>
<p>In addition to Quiet Mode, the Bose QuietComfort Ultra earbuds make use of two other modes. Aware Mode is the transparency option where you can pass through the sounds of your surroundings. Wearing in-ear earbuds do a little bit of noise cancelling physically just because of how they’re design. You plug your ear with them after all. This mode will actually play the sounds from your environment that it’s picking up on its and play them through the earbuds. This is good for a range of use cases, particularly if you’re a runner training on the roads while listening to music. Best to be able to hear traffic to avoid any accidents.</p>



<p>The earbuds are also equipped with Immersion Mode which blends together noise-cancelling with 3D audio. This is able to track your head movements so it feels like you are surrounded on all sides by music that you can physically move throughout, even though it’s all just simulated in your ear.</p>
<p>You can choose between five super sleek colorways, though not all have been treated equally by the Amazon discount gods. The humble black model is right now the cheapest, so if you don’t want a pair of earbuds that are too loud (except in the traditional sense, you’re in luck. Offering slightly more pizazz is the desert gold option. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6592/">These are mostly black, but with a gold accent. They’re also priced at the lowest value of $250</a>. Just above that at $268 is a really striking midnight violet model. Then at full price still ($299,) is the white and deep plum versions.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/dji-gimbal-stabilizers-go-on-clearance-as-osmo-mobile-7p-with-built-in-extension-rod-and-tripod-drops-to-its-all-time-low-2000658108</link>
            <guid>1400494</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Shaky footage is frustrating and, well, headache-inducing, especially when it ends up ruining a perfectly beautiful moment. If you film with your phone and are looking to enjoy stable, steady results, you might want to invest in a gimbal stabilizer.</p>
<p>DJI makes some of the best filming accessories on the market, and <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6702/">we just spotted its Osmo Mobile 7P gimbal stabilizer going at a 20% discount on Amazon.</a> It’s now available for just $103, after the retailer took a sweet $26 off its usual $129 price. Placing your orders today can also help you enjoy free delivery with your purchase, which brings the overall cost down even further. Just be sure to act fast, as the offer is expected to wrap up soon.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6702/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Steady, Hands-Free Footage</h2>
<p>This stabilizer works with both iPhones and Android smartphones. It’s powered by DJI’s seventh-generation stabilization technology to ensure cinema-quality high and low-angle footage at your fingertips, wherever you go. Getting started couldn’t be easier. Unfolding the gimbal turns it on, while the magnetic design makes mounting any paired phone a breeze. Once the phone is up, access the Mimo app with a single click and get to filming right away.</p>
<p>There’s support for native camera features like Apple ProRes and zoom tracking, plus the stabilizer plays nicely with different live streaming apps. Gesture control makes it easy to operate the thing from afar. For instance, the “palm” gesture starts/stops recording, the “Double L” gesture adjusts framing, and making a “V” takes a photo without you having to manually click any buttons. Additionally, you’re getting a built-in fill light which adjusts brightness and color temperature for better, Instagram-worthy results, even in low light conditions.</p>
<p>DJI Mimo offers dual-lens, active tracking. This allows the subject to move freely around while still staying in focus. Play basketball with your little ones, or just show off some dance moves without worrying about the camera focusing on the tree behind. And when there are more than one subjects in the frame, you can effortlessly switch between them by tapping on their selection boxes on your phone. This way, everyone gets to be in the spotlight!</p>



<p>The all-in-one design of the gimbal offers multiple use cases. You can hold it to take selfies or record on the go, as well as set it down as a tripod for solo creation and recording videos. Battery life is another strong selling point. A single charge gets you an operating time of around 10 hours, which is great for extended filming and those long live sessions. Even better, the gimbal is also capable of powering your phone, meaning you won’t have to worry about running out of your smartphone’s battery in the middle of filming an exciting adventure.</p>
<p>Note that you need the DJI Mimo app to get started with using the gimbal. It’s not available on Google Play due to some compatibility issues, but you can install it using the official DJI website.</p>
<p>To wrap it up, this gimbal makes filming a lot more fun, and convenient. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6702/">It typically retails for around $129, but the current discount lets you grab it for $103</a>. There are no delivery charges to worry about, either, so $103 is all you’ve got to pay. Just be sure to get your orders in before the offer expires or the stock runs out.</p>
