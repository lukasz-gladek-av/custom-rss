              <p>Smart lighting transforms bland rooms into dynamic spaces that adapt to mood and activity. <em>Govee</em> just dropped an <strong>exclusive Prime member deal</strong> on its RGBIC Floor Lamp, <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4546/">slashing the price down to $59 from its usual $99.</a> This Black Friday discount is a record low that no one other than a Prime member gets, and if you subscribe, now’s the perfect time to upgrade your lighting game. With <strong>16 million color options and music sync capabilities</strong>, the lamp does away with dead corners and bland ambient lighting.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4546/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<p>The RGBIC designation means<strong> this lamp displays multiple colors simultaneously across different segments</strong>. Traditional RGB lamps can only show one color at a time across the entire fixture, limiting your creative options. The Govee lamp divides the light strip into independent zones that each display different colors, creating flowing gradients and multi-color effects. You can set the bottom to glow blue while the top fades into purple or create rainbow effects that flow up and down the lamp.</p>
<p>The<strong> 1000 lumen output provides serious brightness</strong> that actually works as primary lighting, not accent mood lighting. You can light up an entire corner of a room or use it as your main light source when you want softer, interesting lighting than overhead fixtures provide. The brightness smoothly adjusts from dim ambient glow to full brightness, allowing for granular control over the light intensity.</p>



<h2>Syncs With Music</h2>
<p><strong>Music sync capability</strong> turns the lamp into a reactive light show, pulsing and changing with whatever you’re playing. Equipped with a built-in microphone, the lamp picks up the audio from your room and analyzes the beat, tempo, and intensity. Colors shift and pulse in rhythm to your music, creating an immersive experience that beats static lighting. Sensitivity can be changed depending on volumes of playing music, so it will be as relevant for background jazz as for electronic dance music played at full volume. The <strong>sync works with any audio source in the room</strong>, from TV shows to Spotify to live instruments.</p>
<p>Alexa integration means that when it’s all connected to your Amazon Echo devices, the lamp is completely voice-controllable. Without needing to open the app or touch physical controls, saying, “Alexa, turn on the floor lamp” powers it up. You can change colors with your voice, adjust brightness, turn the lamp on or off, and trigger preset scenes. This voice control becomes key when you are caught up on the couch and do not want to reach for your phone.</p>



<p>The <strong>Govee app unlocks the full potential of the lamp’s 16 million color options</strong>. You can save custom color combinations as presets, browse community-created scenes, and fine-tune every aspect of the lighting. The app <strong>includes dozens of pre-programmed scenes</strong> like “Sunset,” “Ocean,” “Forest,” and “Party” that change the lamp’s appearance with one tap. DIY mode lets you pick specific colors for each segment of the lamp, creating personalized combinations that match your room’s color scheme.</p>
<p>From unboxing to first use, the lamp takes about five minutes to set up. Plug in the lamp, download the Govee app, connect it to your WiFi network, and go. The WiFi connection is a standard 2.4GHz network which most homes are already set up with-no special router configurations are required. The lamp remembers your last settings even in the event of power outages, so it will immediately go back to those settings upon being turned back on. Energy consumption stays very low despite the brightness of the output; it <strong>uses about as much electricity as a regular LED bulb</strong> while offering much more functionality.</p>
<p>This Govee RGBIC Floor Lamp provides smart lighting features that other brands sell at double the price, down to $59 from its usual $99, for Prime members only.</p>
