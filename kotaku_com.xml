The infamous folkloric warlord leaves a huge impression when he first appears in Chapter 2, between <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://youtu.be/8Ic-4h5grk8?si=rUh5YyI4KTB9Uvt0&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://youtu.be/8Ic-4h5grk8?si=rUh5YyI4KTB9Uvt0" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">his rocking theme song</a></span> and the overwhelming power of his attacks. The game tells you to run the moment you see him, but what happens if you stay and fight? Do you unlock anything cool?</p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="194466" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="Help, I’m Catching Feelings For This Wo Long Boss" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="177" data-playlist="194466,197298,197284" data-current="194466"><div><p>Help, I’m Catching Feelings For This Wo Long Boss</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/194466/194466_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/194466/194466_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/194466/194466_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/194466/194466_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/19909.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>When it comes to unlocking, the short answer is no: <strong>defeating Lu Bu when you first see him doesn’t give you any huge reward, but does offer a trophy/achievement. </strong>There’s no secret weapon, nor a huge influx of EXP or skill points to earn. That isn’t to say it’s pointless. <strong>You <em>can</em> feasibly defeat Lu Bu when you first see him, and it has a significant effect on the rest of the level if you manage to pull it off</strong>. But no matter how you slice it, the only real reason you should fight Lu Bu early on is the satisfaction of telling everyone you meet that you did it.</p><p>There is a bit more to all of this, though. So if you want to get into the weeds of Lu Bu’s appearance in Chapter 2, here’s the full breakdown.</p><figure id="" data-id="1426b22cf6ae30dbefe71e1ca93ba787" data-recommend-id="image://1426b22cf6ae30dbefe71e1ca93ba787" data-format="jpg" data-width="2048" data-height="1152" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A screenshot from Dynasty Warriors Origins.

You’re quite silly to try. But since you’re here, if you want to fight Lu Bu come hell or high water, here are a few tips to help you claim victory:</p><p>1: All of Lu Bu’s attacks have elaborate telegraphs. For example, it’s impossible to miss when he jumps into the air and gets ready to use his dive attack, and the timing to perfect dodge it is the same every time. Conversely, Lu Bu leaves himself open after he finishes his attacks, which gives you windows to start piling on damage before you need to watch out for his next move.</p><p>2: You might get tripped up by Lu Bu’s two unique attacks that start with him swinging his halberd in front of him. Normally, he’ll attack twice in a row, so the safest move is to dodge away to avoid the second attack. However, if he glows red, he’ll only take a single swing. Use this to your advantage.</p><p>3: Lu Bu’s most difficult attack to dodge is his bow and arrow move. Lu Bu will attack twice in a wide-reaching cone in front of him, and after a delay he’ll launch one final attack at you. Since you can stagger Lu Bu during this attack, you’ll ideally want to use a skill like Palm Strike so you don’t have to worry about dodging at all. However, if that’s not possible, using a quick special move (like Palm Strike, actually) after you dodge the first strike will interrupt the dodge roll animation, allowing you to immediately dodge the second part of the attack. From there, Lu Bu will finish the attack about 2.5 seconds later.</p><p>If you’d like a visual aid, an especially handsome writer uploaded his first clear of this fight on Hero difficulty, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.pcgamer.com/games/action/dynasty-warriors-origins-goaded-me-into-spending-an-hour-trying-to-beat-lu-bu-then-gave-me-nothing-for-winning-and-i-loved-it/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/action/dynasty-warriors-origins-goaded-me-into-spending-an-hour-trying-to-beat-lu-bu-then-gave-me-nothing-for-winning-and-i-loved-it/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">as seen on PC Gamer</a></span>. You can check out the video for yourself below:</p><h2 id="h12717"><a id=""></a><strong>What happens if you defeat Lu Bu?</strong></h2><p>If you defeat Lu Bu in the Assassination of Dong Zhuo mission, both Lu Bu and Cao Cao will react to your surprising strength. Lu Bu will retreat, and the entire enemy army will suffer a huge morale loss that will make the rest of the mission a total cakewalk. In other words, you take on a huge challenge at the start to make the rest of the mission easier.</p><p>This is true of Lu Bu’s second appearance in Chapter 2 during the Battle of Hulao Gate mission. Normally, Liu Bei, Guan Yu, and Zhang Fei will hold off Lu Bu shortly after he appears. However, if you defeat Lu Bu here, Liu Bei’s party can rejoin the main battle and you won’t have to worry about how long they can fend off the beast of a man. So, again, a huge challenge so you can make the rest of the mission easier.</p><figure id="" data-id="8ac66eb86200cb93385d014610fd28b0" data-recommend-id="image://8ac66eb86200cb93385d014610fd28b0" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A screenshot from Dynasty Warriors Origins. The player character has successfully parried an attack against Lu Bu, and the two have bent their knees as they get ready to fight once more." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A screenshot from Dynasty Warriors Origins. The player character has successfully parried an attack against Lu Bu, and the two have bent their knees as they get ready to fight once more." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Koei Temco / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="8ac66eb86200cb93385d014610fd28b0" data-recommend-id="image://8ac66eb86200cb93385d014610fd28b0" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A screenshot from Dynasty Warriors Origins. The player character has successfully parried an attack against Lu Bu, and the two have bent their knees as they get ready to fight once more." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><h2 id="h12718"><a id=""></a><strong>There is an achievement for beating Lu Bu at Hulao Gate, but you can come back for that later</strong></h2><p>While there aren’t any major in-game rewards beyond a few unique lines of dialogue, defeating Lu Bu here will net you the <strong>The Strongest </strong>achievement or trophy. This will only ding on <em>this </em>mission specifically, so beating Lu Bu during the Assassination of Dong Zhuo mission <strong>will not</strong> unlock it.</p><p>That said, <strong>not only can you go back to this mission during the postgame of <em>Dynasty Warriors: Origins</em>, you’ll need to beat Lu Bu here on a postgame-exclusive difficulty setting to unlock one of the strongest weapons in the game</strong>.</p><hr><p>While there aren’t compelling rewards for beating Lu Bu early on beyond the sheer satisfaction and achivement, it is a good opportunity to get some practice in against him. You <em>will </em>have to fight Lu Bu later on, and these earlier appearances have simpler movesets that you can study and learn. This will make future Lu Bu encounters go a little smoother, since you can focus on dodging the stuff you’ve memorized while you pay attention to the new tricks he has up his sleeve. You can also choose to lower the difficulty or level up if Lu Bu is giving you trouble too, so play your way and don’t stress out about missing anything important!</p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

It first released via a five-day early access period for those who pre-ordered the premium edition. But that ended on February 18. </p><h2 id="h2220823"><a id=""></a><strong>Where can I play <em>Avowed</em>? </strong></h2><p><em>Avowed </em>is out now on PC and Xbox Series X/S.</p><h2 id="h2220824"><a id=""></a><strong>Is <em>Avowed </em>On PS5?</strong></h2><p>Nope! But I’d bet a dollar that it will arrive on PS5 in the future. Obsidian’s next RPG, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.gematsu.com/2024/12/the-outer-worlds-2-adds-ps5-version-launches-in-2025&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/2024/12/the-outer-worlds-2-adds-ps5-version-launches-in-2025" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>The Outer Worlds 2</em>, is coming to PS5 in 2025</a></span>. And Xbox is bringing many of its <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/xbox-ceo-phil-spencer-console-wars-over-ps5-switch-era-1851765304&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/xbox-ceo-phil-spencer-console-wars-over-ps5-switch-era-1851765304">old and new games to PS5</a></span>. So <em>Avowed </em>will likely arrive on Sony’s console one day.</p><h2 id="h2220825"><a id=""></a><strong>Will <em>Avowed </em>be on Switch 2? </strong></h2><p>No port has been announced. But if the Switch 2 can run it, I’d expect Xbox will bring it to the Nintendo’s next-gen machine in the future alongside a PS5 port, too. </p><h2 id="h2220826"><a id=""></a><strong>Is it on Game Pass? </strong></h2><p>Yup! <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/avowed-companion-barks-battles-obsidian-xbox-1851764675&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/avowed-companion-barks-battles-obsidian-xbox-1851764675"><em>Avowed</em></a></span><em> </em>is available to play via Game Pass Ultimate or Game Pass PC. </p><h2 id="h2220827"><a id=""></a><strong>Is <em>Avowed </em>On Steam? </strong></h2><p>Yes. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://store.steampowered.com/app/2457220/Avowed/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2457220/Avowed/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>Avowed </em>is on Valve’s popular digital storefront</a></span>.

If you want to play the game on the go, you might be better off streaming it on your phone via Xbox Game Pass Cloud. </p><h2 id="h2220829"><a id=""></a><strong>Does <em>Avowed </em>support cross-save and cross-buy? </strong></h2><p>Yes! <em>Avowed </em>is an Xbox Play Anywhere game, which means you can hop between your Xbox and your PC freely, assuming your PC can run the game. The Steam version even supports Xbox cloud saves, too. </p><h2 id="h2220830"><a id=""></a><strong>How much space does <em>Avowed </em>take up?</strong></h2><p>75 GB on Xbox Series X/S. About 72 GB on PC. </p><h2 id="h2220831"><a id=""></a><strong>Does it support 60FPS on Xbox? </strong></h2><p>Yes! <em>Avowed</em> includes a performance mode that lets you play the game at 60FPS. However, this is only available on Xbox Series X and not the smaller, cheaper S console. The game also has a 30FPS mode and a 40FPS option that works with 120hz TVs. </p><h2 id="h2220832"><a id=""></a><strong>How long is <em>Avowed?</em></strong></h2><p><em>Avowed </em>will take most players about 30 to 40 hours. I was able to complete most side quests and finish all of the main quests in about 36 hours, though I was rushing to reach the end as I got closer to the finale. </p><p>If you take your time, explore each map completely, and do everything, you can easily spend over 50 hours in <em>Avowed</em>. </p><h2 id="h2220833"><a id=""></a><strong>Can you keep playing after you finish the last quest?</strong></h2><p>No! Once you reach the final big questline of the game, you are warned that there is no going back from that point. So if you want to do everything, you’ll need to save before starting the last quest and load that up later to go back and explore the world fully. Or you can just avoid the final quest while you do other things. </p><h2 id="h2220834"><a id=""></a><strong>Is <em>Avowed </em>an open-world game? </strong></h2><p>Yes, but it’s broken up into separate maps that you can explore freely as you progress through the game. </p><h2 id="h2220835"><a id=""></a><strong>Does it have co-op?</strong></h2><p>No. There is no multiplayer in <em>Avowed</em>. </p><h2 id="h2220836"><a id=""></a><strong>Can I switch from first-person to third-person?</strong></h2><p>Yup! It’s in the settings. </p><figure id="" data-id="957254442debe30537079d85b5fda23e" data-recommend-id="image://957254442debe30537079d85b5fda23e" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Xbox / Obsidian / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="957254442debe30537079d85b5fda23e" data-recommend-id="image://957254442debe30537079d85b5fda23e" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><h2 id="h2220837"><a id=""></a><strong>Is Garrus from <em>Mass Effect</em> in Avowed? </strong></h2><p>No, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/avowed-kai-mass-effect-garrus-voice-brandon-keener-1851765192&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/avowed-kai-mass-effect-garrus-voice-brandon-keener-1851765192">but his voice actor, Brandon Keener, is</a></span>, and as a result Kai is the best character in the game. </p><h2 id="h2220838"><a id=""></a><strong>Do I need to play<em> Pillars of Eternity</em> first?</strong></h2><p>Nope. However, if you do play <em>Pillars of Eternity </em>(and its sequel, <em>Deadfire</em>) first, you’ll likely pick up on the lore faster. I never played those games and within a few hours I was fully immersed in <em>Avowed </em>and its worldbuilding. </p><h2 id="h2220839"><a id=""></a><strong>Are there multiple endings?</strong></h2><p>Oh yeah. There are a lot of ways to save or control the Living Lands. </p><h2 id="h2220840"><a id=""></a><strong>Will there be any DLC for <em>Avowed</em>?</strong></h2><p>Maybe. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.gamesradar.com/games/rpg/avowed-director-confirms-the-game-follows-the-outer-worlds-lead-to-skip-new-game-plus-but-dlc-is-still-a-maybe/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/rpg/avowed-director-confirms-the-game-follows-the-outer-worlds-lead-to-skip-new-game-plus-but-dlc-is-still-a-maybe/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">That’s the official answer from Obsidian Entertainment</a></span>, the studio behind <em>Avowed</em>.
