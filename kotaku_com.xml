While the general public will get to gander at the latest attempt at telling Clark Kent’s story on July 11, film critics and content creators have already shared their opinions.

Tharpe highlighted how the film stood out in the superhero genre by striking an honest tone unique to the Superman ethos.</p><p>“Gunn’s approach is colorful, in both its palette and the costumes; proudly fantastical, with flying orbs, robots, portals, and giant monsters; and at times endearingly, intentionally corny (see: Krypto the super dog). But late in the third act, Superman delivers an impassioned monologue about himself that essentially states Gunn’s thesis about the character and his core values. You won’t find any controversial neck-snapping here.”</p><p>A large swath of critics applauded Gunn’s bold choice to ground <em>Superman</em> in political tensions, using the conflict between two warring countries—Boravia and Jarhanpur—as a central plot point. <em>New York Times</em> movie critic Alissa Wilkinson <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2025/07/08/movies/superman-review.html&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/07/08/movies/superman-review.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">noted in her review</a></span> that her own superhero movie fatigue was no match for <em>Superman</em>’s goofy yet sincere take on the Man of Steel. <em>Vulture</em> critic Alison Willmore, meanwhile, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.vulture.com/article/review-james-gunns-superman-cant-help-but-be-political.html&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.vulture.com/article/review-james-gunns-superman-cant-help-but-be-political.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">emphasized</a></span> that the hero is “the creation of two Jewish American men whose families fled the pogroms and who gave their extraterrestrial defender of the planet a background as a refugee himself.” To her, this somewhat politicized superhero film is a welcomed reflection of our world, and our real-life supervillains.</p><p>At the time o this article’s release, the movie holds an impressive <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/superman_2025&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/superman_2025" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">86 percent approval rating</a></span> on Rotten Tomatoes, with journalists like <em>Associated Press</em> film critic Jake Coyle calling it “something quite rare in the assembly line-style of superhero moviemaking today: human.” That feeling of being reminded why many of us fell in love with comic books in the first place was a common sentiment among those who enjoyed it. To them, <em>Superman</em> was a trip back to their unjaded, zealous youth, when a man leaping tall buildings in a single bound still amazed them.</p><p>Unfortunately, all is not well in Metropolis. A number of critics took issue with what they see as the film’s uninspired plot, lackluster performances by some of the cast, and Krypto, Superman’s adorable dog, outshining some of the human characters. Peter Bradshaw of <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.theguardian.com/film/2025/jul/08/superman-review-david-corenswet-james-gunn&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2025/jul/08/superman-review-david-corenswet-james-gunn" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>The Guardian</em></a></span> didn’t pull any punches when he characterized Corenswet’s performance as “square-faced soullessness,” and derided the movie for its “pointless and cluttered new backstory.” Even some critics who enjoyed the film felt that it had its share of issues. <em>Variety</em>’s Owen Gleiberman placed the movie in his “<span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://variety.com/2025/film/reviews/superman-review-james-gunn-david-corenswet-1236444126/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://variety.com/2025/film/reviews/superman-review-james-gunn-david-corenswet-1236444126/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">next-level good</a></span>” tier alongside movies like <em>Batman Begins</em>, <em>Iron Man</em>, and <em>Thor</em>, But, due to what he sees as <em>Superman</em>’s busy cluttered pacing sometimes preventing the film from slowing down and giving the characters moments of growth and reflection, it fell short of the lofty perch of <em>The Dark Knight</em> and 1980s <em>Superman II </em>for him. </p><p>A few others had much harsher critiques.</p><p>I can almost guarantee Gunn couldn’t care less about the negative reactions, though.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>If, like me, you’ve noticed an uptick in anime girls with horse ears running around your social media timeline, you might be confused as to what the hell is going on. The game causing all this commotion, my friends, is <em>Umamusume: Pretty Derby</em>,<em> </em>a gacha game that has finally made its way to the West after originally launching in Japan back in 2021. The game is based on the titular media franchise in which racehorses are reincarnated as literal horse girls who do what racehorses do best, just as bipedal humans with horse ears on their heads. Given that there are dozens of horse girls in the series, the premise is ripe for a gacha game in which people gamble to unlock their favorite. But what do you do when you’ve got them? The same thing you’d do with a regular racehorse, of course: train them to be the very best.</p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="197589" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="Ring Psychology: Understanding The 6 Phases Of A Wrestling Match Through Heel Era John Cena" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="659" data-playlist="197589,197586,197585" data-current="197589"><div><p>Ring Psychology: Understanding The 6 Phases Of A Wrestling Match Through Heel Era John Cena</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197589/197589_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197589/197589_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197589/197589_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/23110.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>Like a lot of people, I had never heard of <em>Umamusume Pretty Derby </em>before the game’s launch in this part of the world last week. Despite its preposterous premise, the game plays its horse girl races pretty straight and with the kind of gusto and earnest determination you’d expect from any sports anime. As the girls run around the track, there’s spirited commentary, rivalries, and narratives unfolding. If I didn’t see that the girls had horse ears on their heads, I wouldn’t know it wasn’t just a straightforward racing show. Well, at least I wouldn’t until after the girls have crossed the finish line, at which point they put on an idol concert for a crowd of adoring fans. Sure, pop off, queens.</p><p>After <em>Umamusume </em>draws you in with all the glitz and glamour, it does what every one of these games does and bombards you with menus, currencies, and random drops. When I started to navigate these abundant, colorful menus, they crashed my iPhone 12. Maybe it’s time for an upgrade. Wait, is the horse girl gacha game going to get me to an AT&amp;T store to join modern times? What an odd turn of events.</p><p>Anyway, these random drops come in two forms: trainees and support cards. The former are the actual horse girls you’ll be training; the rest are supplementary cards that will give your primary character a boost. Each horse girl has a career that, once completed, allows them to be registered as a Veteran Umamusume and Legacy character, in order to grant stat boosts and other perks to other characters. So you can see how the grind feeds into itself and incentivizes you to train several racers rather than just your favorites. </p><p>When you get set up in your career, parts of the game feel more like playing with a digital pet than I expected. Each girl has different goals, requiring different training regimens to make progress in their story. You’ll also monitor their energy levels, interact with other students at the horse girl academy, and eventually, you’ll send her off to the races. The only real input you get into the competitions themselves is the training you put your horse girl through and the game plan you give her ahead of time. You can make some strategic decisions, like telling her to prioritize pacing herself instead of sprinting like her life depends on it, but the optimal strat is determined by the stats she’s gained through training ahead of races, Ultimately, your goal is to set her up for success; if you were hoping for a more direct racing game, you will not find that here.</p><p>All that being said, there’s potential here for some real sicko grinding and optimizing your racer’s stats, especially as you import legacy characters to boost those attributes and collect support cards through drops. It can make going through the careers feel almost like a rogue-like run in which you try to figure out the best build to claim victory. I see the various hooks <em>Umamusume </em>has lowered into the sea, and while I know the kind of people who gravitate towards these kinds of games might bite,&nbsp;I don’t know if the bait is quite to my liking, personally.&nbsp;I still find its barrage of mechanics and menus overwhelming, though, and there isn’t much else here pulling me in, so I don’t think I’ll be staring into the abyss long enough to get caught up in the gacha mechanics here. Gacha games are all about risk and reward, and I don’t think its wacky concept is enough reward for the risk of opening myself to gambling.</p><p>After spending a couple of hours with <em>Umamusume</em>, its bizarre premise seems to be the most compelling thing it has going for it. It’s got plenty of the drawbacks of other gacha games on the market: full of currencies that you can purchase for ungodly amounts of real-world money, rewards incentivizing you to log in every day, enough menus to overstimulate anyone who dares to install it, and character design so generic I couldn’t identify any of these girls in a line-up with a gun to my head. Lucky for it, the thing that makes it stand out is a memetic absurdist premise that helps it pierce through the oversaturated gacha market. It’s nothing groundbreaking, but it’s just silly enough to <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.vice.com/en/article/umamusume-pretty-derby-breaks-all-time-player-count-record-on-steam-after-twitch-streamers-discover-horse-waifu-racing-game/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/umamusume-pretty-derby-breaks-all-time-player-count-record-on-steam-after-twitch-streamers-discover-horse-waifu-racing-game/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">catch the eye of those who aren’t usually paying attention</a></span>.
