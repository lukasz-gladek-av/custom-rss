              <p>We’re now a few days past Amazon’s made up holiday of Prime Big Deals Days. They invented it so we would all have a good reason to buy a bunch of stuff in the sales drought the exists between Labor Day and Black Friday. If you had let this October 7 and October 8 sale pass on by having not grabbed anything for yourself, you’re not out of luck just yet. Amazon still has a number of live deals in which you can save boatloads on cool stuff. Take this Hisense TV for example. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4732/">The 43-inch model already starts at an affordable price of $350. However, during this limited time deal, It’s come down by 31%. That means you only have a pay a measly $250.</a></p>
<p>Hisense is one of those brands that is hands down the best option for your depending on your priorities. This isn’t some expensive OLED TV which can go for multiple thousands of dollars. You can still get a picture that big, displays and 4K, and has a wide color gamut without taking out a second mortgage on your house. This 4K 43-inch TV has support for Dolby Vision and Dolby Atmos which can enhance your image quality and sound even further.</p>

<p>When it comes to video games, the Hisense smart TV employs Game Mode Plus. This allows you to play games with the picture settings prioritizing what matter for gaming. The variable refresh rate and auto low latency mode will reduce input lag so you player character feels snappy and responsive on screen. Otherwise playing on a screen with bad response times can make it feel like you’re moving your guy through mud.</p>

It’s much easier to just say “<em>The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford</em>,” than it is to type out all of that one letter at a time on those on-screen keypads.</p>

              <p>A smart way to seriously level up your aerial photography and filming game is by grabbing a solid drone camera. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4729/">The DJI Mini 3 Fly More Combo with DJI RC does a great job at that, and you can get your hands on this feature-packed bundle for less right now.</a></p>
<p>Amazon has dropped the price by 20%, bringing it down to $575. That’s almost $150 in savings, and you’re quite literally getting everything you need to start – three intelligent flight batteries, a dedicated controller with a built-in screen, a two-way charging hub, a shoulder bag, and more.</p>

<h2>4K HDR Recording, Plus a Solid Battery Life</h2>
<p>This is a lightweight drone, so it’s easy to carry around in the wild. It records in 4K HDR and supports Dual Native ISO, which means excellent visuals are a given, whether you’re shooting on a bright, sunny day or in the shadows. You can shoot vertically just as well, so it’s also great if you like sharing your stuff on social media and don’t want to bother with editing or cropping. Wind resistance pushes up to 38kph (Level 5), and there’s a 3-axis mechanical gimbal to let you shoot even with the breeze.</p>
<p>You will also be able to explore properly. This is made possible with the 10km max video transmission range that displays a live HD feed with minimal lag on the DJI RC’s built-in 5.5-inch HD screen, regardless of the distance. Then there are a bunch of handy features that make shooting less stressful. For instance, QuickShots take care of camera movements with built-in preset patterns; no need to worry about manual controls.</p>



<p>Of course, there’s nothing more frustrating than an almost-dead battery high up in the air. Here, you’re looking at up to 114 minutes of total flight time with the three included intelligent batteries. Larger areas and longer shoots won’t really be an issue. And since you’re also getting a two-way charging hub thrown in with your purchase, it’s going to be easy to juice everything back up between flights.</p>
<p>Those using a drone camera for the first time will appreciate features like Auto Takeoff, GPS Return to Home, and Precise Hovering. All of this makes it quite easy to get started confidently.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4729/">All in all, this Fly More Combo packs a lot of value for the price. This deal lets you snag it for 20% less than the retail price, but it won’t last too long.</a></p>
