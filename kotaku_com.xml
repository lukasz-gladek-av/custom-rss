              <p><span>The video game industry’s awards season was </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/game-awards-2025-tga-winners-losers-who-won-game-of-the-year-clair-obscur-2000652261"><span>dominated</span></a><span> this year by adulation for French turn-based roleplaying game</span> <a href="https://kotaku.com/games/clair-obscur-expedition-33"><i><span>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</span></i></a><span>. It’s easy to see why so many people loved it, </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/clair-obscur-expedition-33s-loses-indie-game-awards-after-being-accused-of-lying-about-ai-use-2000655119"><span>AI usage</span></a><span> and</span> <a href="https://kotaku.com/indie-game-awards-iga-igf-gdc-clair-obscur-expedition-33-2000644070"><span>controversial status</span></a><span> as an “indie” game aside, but my personal game of the year was a much smaller project that garnered a lot less attention: </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/games/baby-steps"><i><span>Baby Steps</span></i></a><span>. Fortunately, at least one awards show is finally giving it the respect a bunch of us weirdos believe it deserves.</span></p> <p><span>The 2026 Independent Games Festival Awards released </span><a href="https://igf.com/article/baby-steps-strolls-to-lead-with-5-nominations-at-2026-igf-awards"><span>its list of nominees</span></a><span> on January 8, showcasing the incredible work of developers outside the AAA space. </span><i><span>Baby Steps</span></i><span> managed to pick up nominations in five categories, including Excellence in Audio, Excellence in Design, Excellence in Narrative, the Nuovo Award (for “experiences that make the awards jurors think differently about games as a medium”), and the Seumas McNally Grand Prize.</span></p>

 <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/baby-steps-qwop-indie-devolver-pc-ps5-new-trailer-1850521583"><i><span>Baby Steps</span></i></a><span> tells the story of Nate, a man transported from living in squalor in his parents’ basement to a magical world inhabited by long-dicked donkey men and Australians. Navigating this strange setting, at least on PlayStation 5, revolves around using the controller’s triggers to independently control Nate’s feet by lifting them off the ground, and the control stick to have Nate lean in whatever direction you intend on traveling. Even simple walking requires maintaining a rhythm, and things get even more difficult as you climb slippery slopes and awkward rockfaces.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><span>I’m so happy to see </span><i><span>Baby Steps</span></i><span> get this kind of recognition. Not only does it advance the nascent genre of physics-based “rage games” practically invented by co-developer Bennett Foddy (who previously made&nbsp;<em>QWOP </em>and <em>Getting Over It</em>),&nbsp;but it also manages to interrogate the very concept of challenging video game mechanics through both gameplay and narrative. Please play this game, and remember, </span><i><span>Baby Steps</span></i><span> doesn’t want you to rage, it wants you to love yourself.</span></p>

 <p><span>Offbeat local TV broadcast simulator</span><a href="https://kotaku.com/games/blippo-plus"> <i><span>Blippo+</span></i></a><span>, surreal strategy game</span><a href="https://kotaku.com/games/titanium-court"> <i><span>Titanium Court</span></i></a><span>, and the bafflingly controversial</span> <a href="https://kotaku.com/horses-review-steam-epic-games-ban-horror-ride-race-2000651442"><i><span>Horses</span></i></a><span> also received multiple nominations. After seeing </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/game-awards-2025-goty-nominees-categories-clair-obscur-2000644825"><span>the Game Awards</span></a><span>, </span><a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20260115137649/en/Finalists-Announced-for-the-26th-Annual-Game-Developers-Choice-Awards-Led-by-Clair-Obscur-Expedition-33-With-Eight-Total-Nominations"><span>the Game Developers Choice Awards</span></a><span>, and </span><a href="https://www.interactive.org/awards/29th_dice_awards_finalists_93k3p1.asp"><span>the DICE Awards</span></a><span> focus almost exclusively on </span><i><span>Clair Obscur</span></i><span> and other mainstream, AAA fare, it’s refreshing to know there are still shows dedicated to plumbing the depths of the medium rather than remaining at surface level.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><span>Furthermore, this year’s show features a new category honoring games made by women and other gender-marginalized developers in collaboration with investment fund</span> <a href="https://www.wingsfund.me/"><span>Wings Interactive</span></a><span>. Each award comes bundled with a $2,000 bonus, apart from the grand prize which awards $20,000.</span></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Who’s ready to stream the <a href="https://kotaku.com/zelda-live-action-movie-link-bragason-ainsworth-leak-2000644816">new<em> Zelda</em> movie</a> on Netflix at their in-laws’ in 2027? Why did Sony delete over 1,000 shovelware games from PSN? And just how bad are graphics card prices about to get? Welcome to a special afternoon edition of Morning Checkpoint, <em>Kotaku</em>‘s daily roundup of gaming news, rumors, and culture. Look, I was really busy today.</p> <p>Here’s your moment of zen for the weekend: local news broadcasters <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@quietcharacterofficial/video/7595295106295532818">trying to say the names of famous Pokémon</a>.</p>   <h2>Sony and Netflix lock in a new mega deal after the success of <em>K-Pop Demon Hunters</em></h2> <p>“Netflix and Sony Pictures Entertainment (SPE) today announced a landmark global Pay-1 licensing deal. In the exclusive multi-year agreement, SPE’s feature films will stream on Netflix worldwide — an industry-first for Pay-1 — following their full theatrical and home entertainment windows,” the companies revealed this week. Netflix cited Nintendo’s upcoming live-action <em>Zelda</em> adaptation as a specific example toward the <a href="https://about.netflix.com/en/news/netflix-and-sony-pictures-entertainment-enter-new-global-pay-1-deal">bottom of its announcement</a>. It hits theaters on March 26, 2027.</p>

 <p><span>“Some of the first SPE feature film titles that will stream on Netflix as part of the new deal include </span><em><span>The Nightingale</span></em><span>, the highly anticipated adaptation of Kristin Hannah’s global sensation starring Dakota and Elle Fanning together for the first time; Sony Pictures Animation’s </span><em><span>Buds</span></em><span>; Nintendo’s live-action </span><em><span>The Legend of Zelda</span></em><span>; </span><em><span>Spider-Man: Beyond the Spider-Verse</span></em><span>, the conclusion to the groundbreaking<em> Spider-Verse</em> trilogy; and Academy Award-winner Sam Mendes’ audacious quartet of Beatles films,” it read.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <h2>If a graphics card is still being stocked but no one can get it, does it still matter?</h2> <p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yteN21aJEvE"><em>Hardware Unboxed</em> reported</a> earlier this week that the Nvidia RTX 5070 Ti had effectively reached “end-of-life” status and would no longer be supplied by manufacturers. That was sourced in part to comments from Asus, which quickly turned around and said no, no, no, you’ve got it all wrong.</p>

 <p>“Current fluctuations in supply for both products are primarily due to memory supply constraints, which have temporarily affected production output and restocking cycles,” it said <a href="https://press.asus.com/news/statements/asus-rtx-5070ti-5060ti-statement/">in a statement</a>. “As a result, availability may appear limited in certain markets, but this should not be interpreted as a production halt or product retirement.”</p>

 <p>That means you can still get one, right? Right?? A quick search online shows they’re out of stock at Best Buy, Microcenter, and other retailers, with even cards marked up 50 percent over the $750 MSRP being on back order.</p> <h2><em>Toy Story Mania</em> and 13 other Disney games just disappeared from Steam</h2> <p>The delistings were spotted by <a href="https://www.steamgifts.com/discussion/3wgEr/14-disney-games-were-suddenly-delisted" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-analytics-id="inline-link" data-url="https://www.steamgifts.com/discussion/3wgEr/14-disney-games-were-suddenly-delisted" data-hl-processed="none" data-mrf-recirculation="inline-link" data-hawk-tracked="hawklinks" data-mrf-link="https://www.steamgifts.com/discussion/3wgEr/14-disney-games-were-suddenly-delisted">Steamgifts forum member HappyCatEW</a>. Other games removed from Valve’s storefront include <em>Finding Nemo</em>, <em>Disney Fairies: Tinker Bell’s Adventure</em>, and <em>Chicken Little: Ace in Action</em>. It’s unclear if this is part of a larger move on Disney’s part or just someone looking at a particular segment of the gaming division and wondering why it’s still maintaining listings for games that people aren’t really playing. Still, <em>Disney’s Hercules</em> has seven people in-game right now according to SteamDB. Game preservation suffers another blow.</p>

 <h2><em>The Grudge 2</em>‘s Teresa Palmer is the<em> God of War</em> TV show’s latest casting addition</h2> <p><a href="https://variety.com/2026/tv/news/god-of-war-series-cast-teresa-palmer-1236633293/">She’ll play Sif</a>, Thor’s wife, alongside <a href="https://kotaku.com/god-of-war-casting-kratos-ryan-hurst-amazon-tv-series-2000660584">Ryan Hurst</a>, who played Thor in&nbsp;<em>God of War Ragnarök </em>but is playing leading man Kratos here. Getting confused yet? Notably, Sif doesn’t appear in <em>God of War</em> 2018, suggesting the first season of the Amazon adaptation will be blending characters and events from across the whole Norse saga.</p>

 <h2>Sony nukes a bunch of PlayStation shovelware</h2> <p>Over 1,000 games, in fact. The mass deletions were spotted <a href="https://x.com/robthanatos/status/2011487254724952207">by </a><span><a href="https://x.com/robthanatos/status/2011487254724952207">RobThanatos</a> and took aim at ThiGames_DE, which supposedly was ranked 4th for total number of listings across all of PSN. The game titles were things like <em>The Jumping Taco</em>, <em>The Jumping Hot Dog</em>, <em>The Jumping Soda</em>, and<em> The Jumping Taco TURBO</em>. Quick and cheap Platinum trophies, in other words. RIP to some real ones.&nbsp;</span></p> <h2>ICYMI:</h2> <ul> <li><a href="https://kotaku.com/what-even-is-a-video-game-backlog-in-2026-2000659435">Backlog week has begun, but what even is a backlog in 2026?</a></li> <li><a href="https://kotaku.com/monster-hunter-wilds-pc-performance-framerate-dlc-2000660149">There’s a very convincing theory about why <em>Monster Hunter Wilds</em>‘ framerates are so bad on PC</a></li> <li><a href="https://kotaku.com/heres-why-fans-are-convinced-fallout-3-and-new-vegas-remasters-are-about-to-be-revealed-2000660161"><em>The Fallout 3</em> and<em> New Vegas</em> remaster rumors have gotten out of control</a></li> </ul> <h2>Watch this:</h2>

            <title><![CDATA[Starfield Struggled Due To Bureaucracy, Says Bethesda Veteran Who Left After 20 Years]]></title>
            <link>https://kotaku.com/elder-scrolls-6-starfield-bethesda-tes-2000660653</link>
            <guid>1408696</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><span>A veteran designer recently sat down with</span> <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/the-elder-scrolls/bethesdas-former-elder-scrolls-loremaster-on-why-he-left-starfields-communication-breakdowns-and-how-he-wanted-the-elder-scrolls-6-to-be-the-empire-strikes-back"><i><span>PC Gamer</span></i></a><span> to discuss his surprise departure from Bethesda Game Studios in 2023 after two stints and over 20 years at the company. He cited what he saw as detrimental changes in the </span><i><span>Elder Scrolls</span></i><span> and </span><i><span>Fallout </span></i><span>maker’s development process due to Bethesda’s continued expansion as the driving impetus behind his decision.</span></p> <p><span>Kurt Kuhlmann, who worked for Bethesda as a junior designer in the late 1990s before rejoining the studio as a senior designer in 2003, made waves in the industry when he decided to step away from the role. By that time, he had worked on every major game in the </span><i><span>Elder Scrolls</span></i><span> series<!--StartFragment --><span>—</span><!--EndFragment -->apart from the first, </span><i><span>Arena<!--StartFragment --><span>—</span><!--EndFragment --></span></i><span>and was responsible for building out much of its setting and lore.</span></p>

 <p><span>“It was almost certainly time for a change,” Kuhlmann told </span><i><span>PC Gamer</span></i><span>. “There were some things that had been going on for a long time that I’d not been super happy with.”<br> </span></p> <h2>Communication breakdowns on<em> Starfield</em></h2> <p><span>Much of this unhappiness, Kuhlmann explained, revolved around Bethesda’s growth from a handful of developers making games in a basement office to hundreds of people across four studios that were managed by Microsoft. No longer could they just pop in on each other to discuss something and get a quick decision from trusted leaders like executive producer Todd Howard.</span></p>

 <p><span>Instead, senior developer responsibilities were becoming more managerial, and everything had to go through several layers of bureaucracy. Kuhlmann described the environment as prone to “communication breakdowns,” attributing some of Bethesda’s recent development struggles to this bloated, hands-off structure. </span><i><span>Starfield</span></i><span> teams, for instance, were often confused about what they were supposed to be doing as discussion filtered through the various studio leads.</span></p>

 <p><span>“The expectation was your job can’t be also making content if you’re actually managing that scope of the project,” Kuhlmann said. “I didn’t want to work that way, because I like making games and being hands-on. It had gotten to a scale beyond where I was really enjoying working in that environment.”</span></p>

 <h2>An <em>Elder Scrolls 6</em> cliffhanger</h2> <p><span>This shift in priorities, combined with Howard retracting a previous promise to make Kuhlmann lead designer on </span><i><span>The Elder Scrolls 6</span></i><span>, signaled to the veteran it was time to leave Bethesda. Kuhlmann, for his part, does acknowledge it was a smart decision to change his potential responsibilities on the still unreleased game, as he probably wouldn’t have liked the job much due to Bethesda’s new development woes.</span></p>

 <p><span>As for what he envisioned for </span><i><span>The Elder Scrolls 6</span></i><span>, Kuhlmann likened his rough ideas to </span><i><span>Star Wars</span></i><span> sequel </span><i><span>The Empire Strikes Back</span></i><span>: The bad guys would have won, setting up the main conflict of </span><i><span>The Elder Scrolls 7</span></i><span>. The protracted AAA release schedule, however, would likely have made a cliffhanger of that magnitude “unfeasible.”</span></p>

 <p><span>“That’s not a good way to end a game and say, yeah, we’ll see you in 10, 15 years,” Kuhlmann said.</span></p>
