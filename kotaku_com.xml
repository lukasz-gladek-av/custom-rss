Before that, you’ve got the critically demolished <em>Assassin’s Creed </em>and <em>Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time</em>, preceded by Uwe Boll’s monstrously dreadful <em>Far Cry</em> in 2008. (To be fair, <em>Prince of Persia</em> at least squeaked a profit, albeit not enough to prevent planned sequels getting cancelled.) Scattered amongst them are many promised projects that never quite seem to reach our eyes.<br></p><p>One of those is now known  to be <em>Tom Clancy’s Splinter Cell</em>, which <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/splinter-cell-movie-is-happening-tom-hardy-starring-as-5960678&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/splinter-cell-movie-is-happening-tom-hardy-starring-as-5960678">was first confirmed as in development in 2012</a></span>. Set to star Tom Hardy (<em>Mad Max</em>) as ultra-spy Sam Fisher, be written by Eric Warren Singer (<em>Top Gun: Maverick</em>), and later attached to director Doug Liman (<em>Edge of Tomorrow</em>), it was announced at the same time as the Michael Fassbender-starring <em>Assassin’s Creed</em>, although only one of them ever made it to screen. The wrong one? We shall never know.</p><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://thedirect.com/article/splinter-cell-tom-hardy-movie-exclusive&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://thedirect.com/article/splinter-cell-tom-hardy-movie-exclusive" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">According to <em>The Direct</em></a></span>, producer Basil Iwanyk—while on some <em>John Wick</em>-related promotion—said that the movie is “now dead.”</p><p>“That movie would have been awesome,” the <em>Expendables </em>producer told the site. “Just couldn’t get it right, script-wise, budget-wise. But it was going to be great.” Mmm-hmm.</p><p>Admittedly, Clancy’s <em>Splinter Cell</em> conceit of a black-ops agent doing generic spy stuff should have been a fairly easy lift, it didn’t necessarily <em>have</em> to be dreadful. But in a producer’s imagination, it could have been perfection. “It was going to be hardcore and awesome,” he continued.</p><h2 id="h111708"><a id=""></a>Intellectual Propagation</h2><p>Ubisoft has, in fact, created a whole division devoted to the process of converting its IPs to non-interactive screens, called Ubisoft Film &amp; Television. It was one of the production companies behind that atrocious <em>Assassin’s Creed</em> movie, and indeed <em>Werewolves Within</em>, but is probably most successful with the Apple+ TV series <em>Mythic Quest</em>, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/apple-tv-mythic-quest-rob-mcelhenney-season-4-date-1851698983?_gl=1*rpmuw2*_ga*MzQzNjkwNDM2LjE2NDY2NjQ1NzQ.*_ga_V4QNJTT5L0*MTczMTYyNTIwMy4xMTUuMC4xNzMxNjI1MjA2LjU3LjAuMA..&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/apple-tv-mythic-quest-rob-mcelhenney-season-4-date-1851698983?_gl=1*rpmuw2*_ga*MzQzNjkwNDM2LjE2NDY2NjQ1NzQ.*_ga_V4QNJTT5L0*MTczMTYyNTIwMy4xMTUuMC4xNzMxNjI1MjA2LjU3LjAuMA..">which just announced a new season and a spin-off</a></span>.</p><p>The company also has just about every Ubisoft franchise you can think of in some stage of production, including <em>Far Cry</em> and <em>Splinter Cell</em> animated series for Netflix, a <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://news.ubisoft.com/en-us/article/6GCLknCe27aNmvECtOkIK7/watch-dogs-movie-starts-production-this-summer&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://news.ubisoft.com/en-us/article/6GCLknCe27aNmvECtOkIK7/watch-dogs-movie-starts-production-this-summer" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>Watch Dogs</em> movie (with Sony) that is allegedly in production now</a></span>, and...oh gawd...<span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://news.ubisoft.com/en-us/article/2u8UuwZsL8FTVCmHVWIz5y/just-dance-filmrights-acquired-by-sonys-screen-gems&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://news.ubisoft.com/en-us/article/2u8UuwZsL8FTVCmHVWIz5y/just-dance-filmrights-acquired-by-sonys-screen-gems" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">a <em>Just Dance</em></a></span> “feature film,” although that was announced in 2019, and further information has not been forthcoming.
