The big issue is that there’s so many goddamn arms that it’s hard to figure out where the hit’s coming from. The easy tip is that <strong>only one of the arms is holding the sword, but even that can be hard to see at this stage thanks to the dark background</strong>. Still, if you can get a visual grasp on it, that’s what you’re keying off of.</p><p>The only other move of note is an energy blast where the lights in their hands turn purple and they hit you with a wave of Dark energy.

Best we can tell you there is that <strong>their sword will shake a little before the first hit swings down; and the big delay is between the second and third hits</strong>. The good news is it’s easier to see them against the new backdrop, and no individual hit in the combo is dangerous on its own, just <strong>try your damndest not to eat all four strikes</strong>. They also get a second four-hit combo that’s easier to dodge, but the final hit has them flying backwards to charge at you. <strong>There’s a subtle audio cue when the charge is coming, and it’s easily parried.

But here’s a better idea: Stop them from pulling that shit in the first place. <strong>Just before he busts out the new sword, you’ll get a message about them performing a strange ritual with their lamps. The lamps in their hand will glow red in a particular order. Your job is to shoot those four lamps in Free Aim in that exact order</strong>. Get it right, and <em>Sword of Light never happens</em>, and you do a nice chunk of damage to Lampmaster in the process.
