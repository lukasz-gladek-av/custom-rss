The rest of the studio was then mostly populated with fresh graduates. “I didn’t even have a budget when I started, because it was an internal production,” Yoshida said. The <em>Legend of Dragoon</em> team would eventually be 100 strong and  end up costing Sony $16 million. </p><p>A lot of the effort by that large team went toward the game’s infamous 30 minutes of, at the time, gorgeous CGI cutscenes. While the prerendered backgrounds and polygonal character models were looking roughly on par with what Square was doing at the end of the PS1's life, the cinematics helped elevate into a much more epic and lavish-feeling game overall. The other highlight was the timed battle mechanic that turned combat into a mini-rhythm game, an evolution of what Hasebe had created for <em>Super Mario RPG</em> (and which continues in the modern <em>Paper Mario</em> games). <br></p><p>“Eventually, we recouped that (cost), thanks to sales outside Japan,” Yoshida <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/how-sonys-most-creative-studio-rose-from-the-ashes-1458030068?_gl=1*1cb2wzs*_ga*MTc0MjY2NTg1OS4xNzQwMzc1OTc4*_ga_V4QNJTT5L0*MTc0MjgzNzczOS4yOC4xLjE3NDI4NDEwNDAuNTguMC4w&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/how-sonys-most-creative-studio-rose-from-the-ashes-1458030068?_gl=1*1cb2wzs*_ga*MTc0MjY2NTg1OS4xNzQwMzc1OTc4*_ga_V4QNJTT5L0*MTc0MjgzNzczOS4yOC4xLjE3NDI4NDEwNDAuNTguMC4w">previously told <em>Kotaku</em></a></span>. “The sales in the U.S. were very strong.” Unfortunately not strong enough to manifest a sequel or spiritual successor. Fortunately, <em>The Legend of Dragoon</em> is playable today after coming to PS5 a couple of years ago, though deep down in my heart of hearts I’m still hopeful we’ll eventually get <em>The Legend of Dragoon 2</em>. </p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

The gradual drip feed of rewards presented in a straight line evokes strong déjà vu of countless live service and free-to-play games like <em>Fortnite </em>or <em>Genshin Impact</em>. Additionally, <em>Assassin’s Creed Shadows </em>has microtransactions, so you might (reasonably) fear that Projects exist just to separate your cash from your wallet. Fortunately, while Projects are similar to Battle Passes in form, they differ a bit in function.</p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="195776" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="The Week In Games: What’s Coming Out Beyond Assassin's Creed Mirage" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="157" data-playlist="195776,196299,195922" data-current="195776"><div><p>The Week In Games: What’s Coming Out Beyond Assassin's Creed Mirage</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195776/195776_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195776/195776_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195776/195776_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195776/195776_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/21286.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>For starters, <strong>Projects in <em>Assassin’s Creed Shadows</em> are not tied to the microtransaction shop in any way as of writing</strong>. Additionally, unlike many free-to-play games, <strong>Projects don’t appear to have any time limits associated with them either</strong>. You’ll complete weekly quests to progress Projects a la an MMORPG, but that’s the most live service-y part of them. All of this is subject to change, though, especially if Ubisoft rolls out more Projects in the future.</p><h2 id="h799"><a id=""></a>Where to find Projects in Assassin’s Creed Shadows</h2><figure id="" data-id="b43ee668175789fa2f399c3b51a197af" data-recommend-id="image://b43ee668175789fa2f399c3b51a197af" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A menu screen in Assassin’s Creed Shadows.

The Projects tab is selected, and two Projects labeled “The Legacy” and “Awakening” are visible." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>To access your Projects in-game, open your main menu and press the button prompt labeled “Animus” in the top-left corner. If you’re playing with a controller, you’ll need to hold down the button so you don’t open the System menu instead. Once in the Animus menu, you’ll see your active Projects. Here, you can choose which Project you’ll want to work on, as you can’t progress multiple Projects simultaneously.</p><p>No matter which Project you select, you’ll see a similar track of rewards. You’ll earn Legendary equipment, Gold<strong> </strong>(not to be confused with Mon), Data Fragments<strong> </strong>(lore you can read in the Vault), and Keys (the currency used in the rotating Exchange menu). Project progression is tied to your account, so starting a new save file won’t reset your Project progression.</p><h2 id="h800"><a id=""></a>How to progress Projects</h2><figure id="" data-id="c22c7d965177ce8feeb2eda4ccbc4248" data-recommend-id="image://c22c7d965177ce8feeb2eda4ccbc4248" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A screenshot from Assassin’s Creed Shadows.

These are targets that rotate on a weekly basis, but don’t worry; they’re not <em>that </em>hard to complete. <strong>Anomalies seem to reset every Thursday</strong>. You can check how much time is remaining on this week’s Anomalies by selecting the “Anomalies” tab in the Animus menu.</p><p><strong>Anomalies won’t appear until you’ve progressed far enough into the story</strong>. This is just as well, as these can involve spawns in high-level areas that a solo Naoe would likely have trouble taking on. So if you want to get started on these objectives, make sure you <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/assassins-creed-shadows-yasuke-unlock-switch-how-1851771290&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/assassins-creed-shadows-yasuke-unlock-switch-how-1851771290">unlock Yasuke</a></span> and slay villains in Naoe’s quest for revenge. </p><p>Once you can access Anomalies, you’ll find them listed in the Objectives tab of your main menu. Certain anomalies can also be found by accessing the Legend in your Map screen in-game.</p><p>Again, while Project progression is time gated, it’s not something you should worry too much about as you play. <em>Assassin’s Creed Shadows </em>is perfectly playable without paying much attention to this system, and it’s not like you’re competing against other players to get the best gear or anything.
