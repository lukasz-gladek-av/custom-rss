              <p>Over the weekend, the nation witnessed federal officers wrestle a man to the ground and <a href="https://www.startribune.com/heres-what-to-know-about-federal-agents-killing-of-alex-pretti-in-south-minneapolis/601570797">shoot him roughly 10 times</a> on a busy street in Minneapolis, Minnesota. The shocking killing, which came just weeks after President Trump threatened the state with a “day of reckoning and retribution,” has sparked a growing backlash against U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, otherwise known as ICE, including from the voice of PlayStation’s Spider-Man.</p> <p>“We must speak out against injustice,” actor Yuri Lowenthal said in <a href="https://www.instagram.com/yurilowenthal/reel/DT7AxWNDGHd/">a recent Instagram video</a>. “I know that this is not new for large swathes of the American people but every day that we stay silent, it makes it easier for them to shoot us in the streets and round us up and genocide entire people. We must speak out and we have to take care of each other. I implore you, if you are an American citizen, call your senators every day next week and tell them ‘no more money for ICE.’ We will not stand for it.”</p>   <p>Lowenthal has played Peter Parker in each of Insomniac Games’ <em>Spider-Man</em> releases, and is seemingly set to return for an eventual, <a href="https://kotaku.com/spider-man-3-has-plenty-of-ways-to-bring-back-venom-1850976956">unannounced <em>Spider-Man 3</em></a>, plans for which <a href="https://kotaku.com/insomniac-hack-wolverine-ps5-spider-man-3-venom-sony-1851120403">leaked back in 2023</a>. His plea to fans and fellow Americans comes as the death of <a href="https://www.theverge.com/policy/868567/alex-pretti-minneapolis-childhood-friend?view_token=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiJ9.eyJpZCI6IktWYlQ1a1F1ZUUiLCJwIjoiL3BvbGljeS84Njg1NjcvYWxleC1wcmV0dGktbWlubmVhcG9saXMtY2hpbGRob29kLWZyaWVuZCIsImV4cCI6MTc2OTk2NDA1NSwiaWF0IjoxNzY5NTMyMDU1fQ.FrZ0NlULSpVamKAg761dJTzxcH4-LkVYlrvVVZb2ZFc&amp;utm_medium=gift-link">37-year-old Alex Pretti</a> at the hands of masked agents has put pressure on lawmakers to block an increase in funding for ICE. Judicial scrutiny of ICE’s actions in the state has culminated in the acting head being summoned to appear in court this week <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2026/jan/27/ice-director-judge-minnesota">or risk being held in contempt</a>.</p>

 <p>“The more we stay silent to try and shore up a failing illusion of normalcy, the more we trade pieces of our soul and the easier we make it for them to shoot us in the street,” Lowenthal wrote on Instagram. “Call your reps every day this week. Tell them how furious you are, how scared you are, and that they must speak out against what’s happening. The simple message they need to hear is ‘no more money for ICE’.”</p> <p>ICE, which didn’t exist until 2002, was <a href="https://www.npr.org/2026/01/21/nx-s1-5674887/ice-budget-funding-congress-trump">recently awarded a $75 billion funding increase</a> on top of its existing annual budget of $10 billion. Top Border Patrol official Gregory Bovino wrote over the weekend that the real victims in Pretti’s killing <a href="https://x.com/CMDROpAtLargeCA/status/2015535669175541906">were the agents</a>.</p>

              <p>It’s a big week for updates. <em>Splatoon 3</em>, <em>Kirby Air Riders</em>, and <em>Helldivers 2</em> all have new content coming. Unfortunately, none of those patches include physical trading cards with energy drink inside. It’s another edition of Morning Checkpoint, <em>Kotaku</em>‘s daily roundup of gaming news, rumors, and culture. <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/spectrum.ieee.org/post/3mdfxz2kqfu2u">Meet Spout</a>, the newest AI robot getting “snatched up” by Disney and others because it can dance and clean up toys.

They’re only available in Japan (for now) and function as loot boxes so you won’t know which one you’re getting until you open the packaging. That way you can collect them all and bestow them to your great grandkids as proof of our 21st century decadence. Finally, an easier way to consume energy drinks!</p>

 <p><span dir="auto">“When playing games, taking an exam, in a meeting, or driving a car—in situations that require concentration, many people face the challenge of refueling, which equates to a break in concentration.

Director Masahiro Sakurai said the goal is to get the Switch 2 exclusive to a solid place and then <a href="https://kotaku.com/kirby-air-riders-balance-patch-notes-dlc-sakurai-smash-bros-2000653001">leave it be</a>.</p>

It adds a new Flow Aura state that spreads extra ink for a short time after players get a kill streak. It also brings changes to hit detection, opponent health bar notifications, and a new Stealth Jump gear ability to prevent the enemy team from seeing where players land.</p>

 <h2><em>Helldivers 2</em>‘s new Warbond hints at the return of Cyborgs</h2>  <p>They were an enemy faction back in the first game.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>From the moment <a href="https://kotaku.com/highguards-small-team-sizes-are-a-problem-2000663511"><em>Highguard</em></a> was revealed in December at the Game Awards, the free-to-play shooter has been marketed as coming from people who helped create and develop <em>Titanfall</em> and its battle royale spin-off, <em>Apex Legends</em>. But now, <em>Highguard</em> seems to be backpedaling away from making that direct connection.</p> <p>On January 26,&nbsp; <a href="https://kotaku.com/highguard-impressions-titanfall-2-apex-multiplayer-shooter-2000663136"><em>Highguard’s</em> big launch day on PC and consoles</a>, the devs quietly made a small but very interesting change to the game’s store page on Steam. <a href="https://imgur.com/a/highguard-from-creators-of-apex-legends-wwphyYY"><em>Highguard’s</em> original Steam description said this</a>:</p> <blockquote><p>From the creators of <em>Apex Legends</em> and <em>Titanfall</em>, comes <em>Highguard</em>: a PvP raid shooter where players will ride, fight, and raid as Wardens, arcane gunslingers sent to fight for control of a mythical continent.</p></blockquote> <p>But on Monday, <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/4128260/history/#:~:text=All%20rights%20reserved.-,Change%20U%3A71820520,-23%20hours%20ago">as documented by SteamDB</a>, this was tweaked to remove all mention of <em>Titanfall</em> and its spin-off. Now the store page simply says:</p>

 <blockquote><p><em>Highguard</em> is a PvP raid shooter where players will ride, fight, and raid as Wardens, arcane gunslingers sent to fight for control of a mythical continent.</p></blockquote> <p>This is a significant change, considering the very first words we heard about <em>Highguard</em> publicly from Geoff Keighley included direct mention of these EA-published sci-fi shooters and how the studio behind <em>Highguard</em> was made up of former <em>Titanfall</em> devs. <a href="https://youtu.be/twK-acOec9o">Here’s what Geoff said at the 2025 Game Awards before debuting <em>Highguard’s</em> first trailer</a>:</p> <blockquote><p>“Our final world premiere comes from 61 members of the team that built <em>Apex Legends</em> and <em>Titanfall</em>. Four years ago, the principals founded a new, independent studio with the hopes of pushing the shooter genre forward…”</p></blockquote> <p><a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2026/01/26/highguard-preview/">An <em>Xbox Wire</em> post published on launch day</a> also directly mentions <em>Titanfall</em> and <em>Apex Legends</em>. But <em>Highguard’s</em> store pages on the Xbox and PlayStation digital storefronts don’t mention either game or the studio’s connection to them.</p>

 <p><em>Kotaku</em> has contacted <em>Highguard</em> PR and its devs to find out more.</p> <p>Of course, some are already speculating as to why this change was made. Did EA’s lawyers get involved? Did the devs behind <em>Highguard</em> want to distance the FPS, which is receiving horrible reviews on Steam, from <em>Titanfall</em> and their former colleagues’ work? Or did someone in marketing simply decide the Steam store page text was too long and wanted to shorten it up? We don’t know for now, but either way it is a very curious change and just one more odd development in the <em>Highguard</em> saga.</p>
