            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><em>Star Wars: Outlaws</em> recently landed on Nintendo Switch 2, and <a href="https://kotaku.com/star-wars-outlaws-switch-2-assassins-creed-shadows-framerate-2000621760">despite some initial fears</a> that it would look and run terribly, the game is a bit of a technical marvel and easily the most impressive Switch 2 port yet. And now, a new update has improved this already wonderful-looking open-world action game on Nintendo‚Äôs hybrid console. Plus, a demo is coming, too.</p> <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/star-wars-outlaws-review-size-how-big-hours-xbox-ps5-pc-1851631123">Ubisoft and Massive‚Äôs open-world <em>Star Wars: Outlaws </em></a>was an incredibly gorgeous game when it launched last year. Sure, stealth sections could be annoying and combat could feel a bit stiff, but getting to walk around a perfectly recreated section of the<em> Star Wars</em> universe freely was amazing. <a href="https://kotaku.com/star-wars-outlaws-patch-stealth-speeder-softlock-1851665149">And some later updates improved the game a lot</a>, introducing some visual improvements on top of some significant gameplay tweaks.&nbsp; So I wasn‚Äôt sure what to expect when I booted up <em>Outlaws</em> on a Switch 2. Turns out, Ubisoft Red Lynx, who ported the game, did an amazing job. While it‚Äôs capped at 30FPS and lacks some of the higher-fidelity assets from the bigger console ports, this version of <em>Outlaws</em> is extremely playable, looks sharp, and feels great in handheld mode. <a href="https://youtu.be/XlKCBGzrB1I">As explained by Digital Foundry, it‚Äôs truly an extraordinary port.</a> Now, Ubisoft has made it look even better with the game‚Äôs first Switch 2 update.</p> <p><a href="https://www.ubisoft.com/en-gb/game/star-wars/outlaws/news-updates/5d48mFSwXrfRnDvvBmOl7F/nintendo-switch-2-title-update-1">On September 8, Ubisoft put out a patch for <em>Star Wars: Outlaws</em> on Switch 2</a> that features numerous visual improvements. Players should now see less ‚Äúpop in,‚Äù less flickering smoke, better shadows, nicer-looking leaves, and a host of other ‚Äúsmall visual fixes.‚Äù For a game that already felt like it was pushing the Switch 2‚Äôs hardware to its limits, I‚Äôm impressed by Ubisoft cranking the knob a bit more to eke out an even nicer-looking port.</p> <p>Oh, and if you want to see the game in action on your Switch 2 without buying it, good news: <a href="https://www.ubisoft.com/en-us/game/star-wars/outlaws/news-updates/1kKhQ1Heps7YmSJdFiV87L/switch-2-release-faq">Ubisoft has updated the game‚Äôs FAQ page</a> to confirm that a demo for <em>Outlaws</em> is coming. Ubisoft says it will ‚Äúshare more information soon‚Äù about this upcoming demo.&nbsp; Anyway, here‚Äôs the full patch list for the new <em>Outlaws</em> update on Switch 2.</p> <p><strong>General Gameplay</strong></p> <ul> <li>Fixed several issues where NPCs would not spawn, e.g. when chasing Kay during the ‚ÄòCrashed‚Äô quest on Toshara</li> <li>Reduced likelihood of Kay being stuck when traversing the environment</li> <li>Improved hiding and detection when in tall grass on Akiva</li> <li>Various stability improvements and other minor fixes</li> </ul> <p><strong>Graphics</strong></p> <ul> <li>Improvements made to visual quality when moving quickly through the world or using binoculars, with less ‚Äúpop in‚Äù</li> <li>Reduced flickering with smoke and lighting</li> <li>Improved shadows at the edge of the screen when moving in cities and stations</li> <li>Improved quality of leaves, cloth and other things that let light through</li> <li>Various other small visual fixes and improvements</li> </ul> <p><strong>Camera</strong></p> <ul> <li>Fixed camera movement when traversing certain objects in certain ways with Kay</li> </ul> <p><strong>UI</strong></p> <ul> <li>Fixed controller image types and directional button prompts when switching between Joy-Con and Pro Controller</li> <li>Fixed the gadget inventory HUD not resizing when using the handheld preset custom scaling settings</li> </ul> <p><strong>Wild Card Story Pack</strong></p> <ul> <li>Fixed an issue where NPCs would not be highlighted when using Nix to plant a card</li> </ul> <p><strong>A Pirate‚Äôs Fortune Story Pack</strong></p> <ul> <li>Mynocks are now visible when attached to your ship</li> </ul>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/xbox-game-pass-car-cloud-gaming-lg-kia-2000624462</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/microsoft%E2%80%99s-%E2%80%98everything-is-an-xbox%E2%80%99-crusade-is-coming-for-your-car.1292856/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Microsoft wants to turn your car <a href="https://kotaku.com/meta-quest-3s-xbox-vr-game-pass-price-handheld-1851784984">into an Xbox, too</a>. Not content just to stream Game Pass to your TV, laptop, or smartphone, it‚Äôs also aiming to beam hits like <em>Forza Horizon 5</em> directly into your Kia Sportage. Microsoft and LG announced a new partnership on Tuesday to bring Xbox Cloud Gaming to over 20 million internet-connected vehicles by 2030. Who‚Äôs ready to play <em>The Elder Scrolls 6</em> in the back of their Uber?</p> <p>‚ÄúOur work with LG is the latest example of Xbox expanding to new places, building on partnerships that already bring Xbox Cloud Gaming to mobile devices, PCs, and TVs,‚Äù Xbox marketing VP Christopher Lee <a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2025/09/09/xbox-cloud-gaming-vehicles-cars-lg/">said in a blog post</a>.&nbsp;‚ÄúBy adding vehicles to the mix, we‚Äôre giving players more choice than ever in how they enjoy their games.‚Äù</p>  <p>The initiative only pertains to EVs that support LG‚Äôs webOS Automotive Content Platform (ACP) which at this point is primarily Kia and mostly not in the U.S. But LG exec Eun Seok-hyun is promising there will be 20 million of these vehicles on the road&nbsp;<em>somewhere</em> in the next five years. Whether that includes the country where Microsoft is headquartered or not will depend on whether Congress ever revives the electric vehicle tax credit program it recently killed. Otherwise anyone who wants to make their car into an Xbox will have to do it <a href="https://xboxfreedom.com/xbox-360-game-car-installation-2265">the old-fashioned way</a>.</p> <p>Xbox‚Äôs recent pivot to being hardware-agnostic comes as it‚Äôs developing dedicated gaming OS layers for Windows on PC handhelds and bringing more of its exclusives to PS5 and Switch 2. It‚Äôs unclear if that will move the needle much on the overall growth of Game Pass, which hasn‚Äôt announced <a href="https://kotaku.com/diablo-4-game-pass-xbox-podcast-date-1851261824">new subscriber numbers in over a year</a>. This new campaign to turn cars into Xboxes comes just as Microsoft announces <a href="https://www.theverge.com/report/774414/microsoft-return-to-office-policy-announcement">a mandatory return</a> to the office for all employees within a 50-mile radius of its Redmond campus. Now they‚Äôll have something new to do while sitting in traffic, at least eventually.</p>
