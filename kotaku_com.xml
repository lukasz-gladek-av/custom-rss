<p>The latest game in the <i>AI: Somnium Files</i> series arrived last month, and it’s shorter than the previous ones. <i>No Sleep for Kaname Date</i> is actually a spin-off that takes place between the first two games, <i>AI: The Somnium Files</i> and <i>AI: The Somnium Files -Nirvana Initiative-</i>, as well as sees the return of our original protagonist, Kaname Date.</p> <p>This time around, Kaname Date must save our favorite idol Iris after she gets abducted by a UFO and is forced to play various escape games to survive. Directed by Kazuya Yamada supervised by original series creator Uchikoshi, <i>No Sleep for Kaname Date</i> implements escape room puzzles similar to that of the <em>Zero Escape</em> series, which Uchikoshi also created. These escape room scenarios help pad out N<em>o Sleep for Kaname Date</em> despite its much shorter length.</p>  <p><i>No Sleep for Kaname</i> has five chapters for you to play through, along with multiple “dead-end” endings.</p>

 <p>In the game, you’ll have to go through “Somniums” (different from the escape rooms) which are pseudo puzzles that you’ll need to solve in order to progress the story. During these Somnium investigations, you’ll be on a timer, so you won’t have time to examine every item. But examining every item unlocks “eyeballs,” which are in-game currency that lets you unlock bonus content for after you’ve beaten the main story (don’t worry, there are no real-world microtransactions). You can also earn more eyeballs by finding collectibles throughout the game.</p> <p>Some of the bonuses you can unlock include concept art and extra endings called “alternate alternate endings.” They cost a certain amount of eyeballs to unlock, and some of the bonuses may not appear until you’ve reached certain alternate endings in the story.</p> <figure id="attachment_2000618125" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000618125"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000618125">© Screenshot: Spike Chunsoft Co., Ltd.</figcaption></figure> <p>You will have to replay certain chapters, Somniums, and escape room puzzles to find the alternate endings, but thankfully, the game’s flowchart notes which chapters have them. That way, you won’t have to blindly search for them.</p>

 <p>That being said, a full playthrough of No Sleep for Kaname Date should take you about 12-15 hours to complete, depending on how good you are at solving escape puzzles.</p> <h2><span id="how-many-achievements-does-no-sleep-for-kaname-date-have"></span>How many Achievements does <em>No Sleep for Kaname Date</em> have?<span></span></h2> <p><i>No Sleep for Kaname Date</i> is available for Switch and Steam. While the former doesn’t have an achievement system, the latter does. Since this game is much shorter than the others, you’re looking at about an extra five hours to unlock all of the achievements.</p> <h2><span id="is-no-sleep-for-kaname-date-on-playstation-or-xbox"></span>Is No Sleep for Kaname Date on PlayStation or Xbox?<span></span></h2> <p>Right now, <i>No Sleep for Kaname Date</i> is only on Switch and Steam. While the previous two games are on all platforms, including PC, PlayStation, Switch, and Xbox, <i>No Sleep for Kaname Date</i> has not been announced for PlayStation and Xbox.</p>

 <figure id="attachment_2000618126" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000618126"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000618126">© Screenshot: Spike Chunsoft Co., Ltd.</figcaption></figure> <p>However, that doesn’t mean that developer Spike Chunsoft won’t bring them over later. 2023’s Master Detective Archives: Rain Code was a Switch exclusive until it came to all other platforms a little over a year later. Given <em>AI: The Somnium Files</em>, it’s definitely possible that <i>No Sleep for Kaname Date</i> will arrive on other platforms in the future.</p> <hr> <p><i>No Sleep for Kaname Date – From AI: The Somnium Files</i> launches on July 25 for Switch/Switch 2 and PC.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              
              <p>Soccer (or football) is the most popular sport in the world, so it makes sense that an exciting online multiplayer game that nails the fundamentals of the pastime would be well-received. And developer Sloclap has succeeded at this by kicking the ball directly into the goal with <i>Rematch</i>. Following in the footsteps of beloved titles like <i>Rocket League</i> with its vibrant, arcade-style gameplay that pits teams together in frenetic showdowns, <i>Rematch</i> is basically everything someone could ask for in a soccer game.</p> <p>So, if you’re diving into <i>Rematch</i>‘s fast-paced matches and wondering whether you’ll be able to team up with friends on other platforms, you’re probably curious about the game’s crossplay functionality. Here’s what you need to know about crossplay in <i>Rematch</i>.</p> <p>Unfortunately, <b><i>Rematch</i></b><b> does not feature crossplay </b><b><i>yet</i></b>. However, that shouldn’t get you down too badly, as Sloclap has some good news for soccer fans awaiting this feature. <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2138720/view/625556610639462619">It’s been confirmed</a> that cross-play will arrive around the end of August with Patch 3:</p>

 <blockquote><p>“Patch 3 should hopefully arrive by the end of August, and will fix some remaining known issues, and importantly introduce Crossplay to the game (at last!). Some gameplay tweaks might also be introduced in Patch 3 (looking at you, Ippy Slide), but that’s still to be confirmed. More news very soon!”</p></blockquote> <p>At <a href="https://www.playrematch.com/post/rematch-launch-priorities-next-steps">launch the studio stated</a>, “It’s very important for us that our players are able to enjoy <i>Rematch</i> with their friends, so along with bugfixes, crossplay is our absolute highest priority, we’re committed to delivering this feature swiftly, and we’ll share a more precise deadline as soon as possible.”</p> <p>So, we should expect to hear more about this feature in the coming days as Sloclap continues to work diligently on the popular game. In the meantime, you’ll have to stick to playing <i>Rematch</i> with pals within your gaming ecosystem. It’s a bummer, but at least you know it’s temporary!</p> <hr> <p><i>Rematch</i> is available now on PS5, Xbox Series X/S, and Windows PCs.</p>

              <p><i>PUBG: Battlegrounds</i> was one of the earliest battle royale titles to release and is widely considered to be the one that brought the sub-genre into the mainstream. But despite being around for so many years, it’s still managing to keep its update train rollin’ to entice new and returning players to continue sneaking, looting, and blasting their way to chicken dinners.</p> <p>Whether you’re coming back from a long time away, or you’re just checking the game out for the first time, you may be wondering about whether it offers cross-platform features. Here’s what to know about crossplay and cross-progression in <i>PUBG: Battlegrounds</i>.</p> <p>Unfortunately, <i>PUBG: Battlegrounds</i>‘ crossplay situation isn’t cut and dry. While it does offer crossplay, it takes a much more limited approach to the feature than many similar multiplayer titles. Let me break it down in an easy-to-understand format below.</p>

 <ul> <li aria-level="1">Crossplay is supported between PlayStation and Xbox consoles.</li> <li aria-level="1">Crossplay is not supported between consoles and PC.</li> <li aria-level="1">Crossplay is not supported between any platforms and <i>PUBG: Mobile</i>, as it is its own separate game.</li> </ul> <p>So, as you can see, the only platforms that work together are PlayStation and Xbox. So, if you’re a console player who has friends on PC, well, no you don’t.</p> <h2>Does <i>PUBG: Battlegrounds</i> have cross-progression?</h2> <p>Things are more straightforward when it comes to <i>PUBG: Battlegrounds</i>‘ cross-progession status. But that’s mostly because <b><i>PUBG: Battlegrounds</i></b><b> does not offer cross-progression at all</b>. This means that if you pick up a copy of the game on one platform and make a lot of progress, you’ll still need to start over with a whole new account when moving to another platform.</p> <p>It’s definitely a bummer not to see cross-progression supported in one of the most beloved battle royale titles in the world. But given that it was released before cross-platform features became the norm, it’s a bit more forgivable, I suppose.</p> <hr> <p><i>PUBG: Battlegrounds</i> is available now on PS5, Xbox Series X/S, and Windows PCs.</p>

<p><i>Overwatch 2</i> remains one of the most popular games in the multiplayer gaming arena due to its lovable roster of characters, strategic gameplay, and consistent updates that keep things feeling fresh for both new and returning players. And if you are brand new to the game or haven’t played in some time, you might be wondering what’s going on in this long-running hero shooter. So let’s get to everything you need to know about <i>Overwatch 2</i> in late summer, 2025.</p> <h2><span id="what%e2%80%99s-going-on-with-the-current-season"></span>What’s going on with the current season?<span></span></h2> <p><i>Overwatch 2</i> is currently winding down on <a href="https://news.blizzard.com/en-us/article/24216161/season-17-hits-with-a-midseason-surge">season 17</a> which saw some reworks to New Junk City and Suravasa, as well as a taste of what’s to come in season 18 with a preview of a new support hero, Wuyang. In fact, you can play as him right now, as his Hero Trial is expected to go until August 18.</p> <p>But Season 18 will arrive in full on August 26, and with it Wuyang will fully join the roster. Also, for the new season, Sojourn will get a new mythic hero skin. You can learn all about that from <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBK1JI1Vjeg&amp;t=1814s">the dev livestream here</a>.</p>

 <p><iframe loading="lazy" title="Dev Livestream: Season 18 Mythic Hero Reveal" width="500" height="281" src="about:blank" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen="" data-rocket-lazyload="fitvidscompatible" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/qBK1JI1Vjeg?start=1814&amp;feature=oembed"></iframe></p> <p>We also know that Sojourn will be getting some new perks. The Deceleration Field, which will replace the Extended Mag, will see hit enemies slowed down by a quarter of their top speed. Sojourn’s Adhesive Siphon in favor of her new Friction Generators, which will give her as much as 50 energy while sliding. You can read more about these changes, as well as some updates to Juno in <a href="https://news.blizzard.com/en-us/article/24226732/weekly-recall-2-perks-2-furious">this official preview of season 18</a>.</p> <h2><span id="who-are-the-best-heroes-right-now"></span>Who are the best heroes right now?<span></span></h2> <p>While season 18 is likely to change things up, right now we’re seeing Orisa and Ramattra leading the pack when it comes to tanks, Tracer and Cassidy laying claim to the best DPS, and Baptiste and Kiriko dominating the support heroes.</p> <p>Of course, given the importance of great teamwork, it’s always hard to sus out which heroes are best at any given moment. So if you’ve been out of the loop for some time, it might be worth jumping back in with a main that feels familiar to you. And if you find they’re not up to snuff anymore, try out one of the ones we just mentioned.</p>

 <h2><span id="does-overwatch-2-have-crossplay-support"></span>Does <i>Overwatch 2</i> have crossplay support?<span></span></h2> <p>If you’re wanting to join up with friends on other platforms, I’ve got some good news for you: <b><i>Overwatch 2</i></b><b> features full crossplay support</b>. This means that you can team up with your friends across any platform by adding one another’s Battle.net accounts, which is a quick and easy process.</p> <p>The exception to this crossplay rule is Competitive matches, where console and PC players are separated due to the perceived edge of mouse and keyboard players. While this may disappoint more hardcore players looking to truly test their mettle, most folks should be happy having some casual fun in Quick Play, Arcade, and Custom Matches. That’s not so bad!</p>

 <h2><span id="does-overwatch-2-have-crossprogression"></span>Does <i>Overwatch 2</i> have cross-progression?<span></span></h2> <p>The good news continues, as <b><i>Overwatch 2</i></b><b> also fully supports cross-progression</b>. With this feature, you can easily jump between different platforms while maintaining your account’s progress. So, if you’d like to play a few matches on PC before relaxing in bed with your Nintendo Switch 2, no one’s stopping you. All you need to do is ensure you’re signed into the same Battle.net account on each device, and you’re all set!</p> <hr> <p><i>Overwatch 2</i> is available now on PS5, Xbox Series X/S, Nintendo Switch, Nintendo Switch 2, and Windows PCs.</p>

<p>There are few games as well-known in the general population as <i>Fortnite</i>. Even your grandmother knows what it is because she’s bought your cousin $700 in V-Bucks over the past month so he can play as a hot dog or whatever. This beloved battle royale is showing no signs of slowing down anytime soon, either. But maybe it’s been a little while since you’ve played or you’ve yet to jump out of your first party bus. Let’s get into what you need to know to get into <i>Fortnite</i> in 2025.</p> <h2><span id="what%e2%80%99s-the-deal-with-the-current-season"></span>What’s the deal with the current season?<span></span></h2> <p>At the time of this writing, <i>Fortnite</i> is up to Chapter 6, Season 4, which went live on August 7, 2025 and it features new characters from <i>Halo</i> and <i>Power Rangers</i>. We can expect this season to take us into the Fall of this year before the new one arrives.</p> <p>The current season sees a bit of a pest-control problem on the island. Throughout the map you’ll find various gross nests, eggs, and the like. There are also three queen insects you’ll need to take down to earn yourself a mythic weapon. For full details on these pests and where on the map you can expect to find them, <a href="https://www.fortnite.com/news/bad-bugs-bite-the-bullet-in-fortnite-battle-royale-shock-n-awesome?lang=en-US">check out the official blog post.</a></p>

 <h2><span id="what-are-the-best-guns-in-the-game-right-now"></span>What are the best guns in the game right now?<span></span></h2> <p>Right now, it’s looking like it’s SMG season, folks. The Veiled Precision SMG is arguably at the top of the pack when it comes to mowing down your opponents. That said, the Deadeye DMR is also a great pick for those who like to place their shots with more precision. And if you’re into looking weird while taking out multiple foes at once, give the Bug Blaster a shot.</p> <h2><span id="what-got-vaulted/unvaulted"></span>What got vaulted/unvaulted?<span></span></h2> <p>This season sees the following changes to the game’s arsenal, as<a href="https://x.com/osirion_gg/status/1953357145140809934"> per Osirion on X</a>.</p> <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">BR LOOT POOL UPDATES</p> <p>unvaulted/added:<br>– Hammer Assault Rifle<br>– O.X.R.

Yes, it really is that seamless.</p> <p>In other words, anywhere you go, <i>Fortnite</i> is there. Watching. Waiting. Expecting you. Needing you. Feed it money. It’s hungry. You want that new skin.
