              <p>From the moment <a href="https://kotaku.com/highguards-small-team-sizes-are-a-problem-2000663511"><em>Highguard</em></a> was revealed in December at the Game Awards, the free-to-play shooter has been marketed as coming from people who helped create and develop <em>Titanfall</em> and its battle royale spin-off, <em>Apex Legends</em>. But now, <em>Highguard</em> seems to be backpedaling away from making that direct connection.</p> <p>On January 26,&nbsp; <a href="https://kotaku.com/highguard-impressions-titanfall-2-apex-multiplayer-shooter-2000663136"><em>Highguard’s</em> big launch day on PC and consoles</a>, the devs quietly made a small but very interesting change to the game’s store page on Steam. <a href="https://imgur.com/a/highguard-from-creators-of-apex-legends-wwphyYY"><em>Highguard’s</em> original Steam description said this</a>:</p> <blockquote><p>From the creators of <em>Apex Legends</em> and <em>Titanfall</em>, comes <em>Highguard</em>: a PvP raid shooter where players will ride, fight, and raid as Wardens, arcane gunslingers sent to fight for control of a mythical continent.</p></blockquote> <p>But on Monday, <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/4128260/history/#:~:text=All%20rights%20reserved.-,Change%20U%3A71820520,-23%20hours%20ago">as documented by SteamDB</a>, this was tweaked to remove all mention of <em>Titanfall</em> and its spin-off. Now the store page simply says:</p>

 <blockquote><p><em>Highguard</em> is a PvP raid shooter where players will ride, fight, and raid as Wardens, arcane gunslingers sent to fight for control of a mythical continent.</p></blockquote> <p>This is a significant change, considering the very first words we heard about <em>Highguard</em> publicly from Geoff Keighley included direct mention of these EA-published sci-fi shooters and how the studio behind <em>Highguard</em> was made up of former <em>Titanfall</em> devs. <a href="https://youtu.be/twK-acOec9o">Here’s what Geoff said at the 2025 Game Awards before debuting <em>Highguard’s</em> first trailer</a>:</p> <blockquote><p>“Our final world premiere comes from 61 members of the team that built <em>Apex Legends</em> and <em>Titanfall</em>. Four years ago, the principals founded a new, independent studio with the hopes of pushing the shooter genre forward…”</p></blockquote> <p><a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2026/01/26/highguard-preview/">An <em>Xbox Wire</em> post published on launch day</a> also directly mentions <em>Titanfall</em> and <em>Apex Legends</em>. But <em>Highguard’s</em> store pages on the Xbox and PlayStation digital storefronts don’t mention either game or the studio’s connection to them.</p>

 <p><em>Kotaku</em> has contacted <em>Highguard</em> PR and its devs to find out more.</p> <p>Of course, some are already speculating as to why this change was made. Did EA’s lawyers get involved? Did the devs behind <em>Highguard</em> want to distance the FPS, which is receiving horrible reviews on Steam, from <em>Titanfall</em> and their former colleagues’ work? Or did someone in marketing simply decide the Steam store page text was too long and wanted to shorten it up? We don’t know for now, but either way it is a very curious change and just one more odd development in the <em>Highguard</em> saga.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Resident Evil Requiem Director Responds To Open-World Speculation]]></title>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>For months ahead of <em>Resident Evil Requiem</em>‘s February release date, rumors have persisted that the game is “<a href="https://screenrant.com/resident-evil-9-open-world-rumors-good-bad/">open-world.</a>” That would certainly be a significant shift away from previous games, but it’s not something players should expect from <em>Requiem</em>&nbsp;<a href="https://gameinformer.com/2026/01/26/resident-evil-requiem-director-sets-the-record-straight-this-isnt-an-open-world-game">according to director Koshi Nakanishi, who said as much in an interview with <em>Game Informer</em></a>.</p> <p>“[The development team] did just want to make clear one point,” Nakanishi said while speaking to <em>Game Informer</em>. “They’ve seen some speculation of whether there’s any open-world elements in the game, and they just want to set the record straight that this isn’t an open-world game.”</p>

 <p>He continued: “The main concept behind this game is combining the very different gameplay of Grace and Leon into a cohesive package, and having those two gameplays represent the <em>Resident Evil</em> series, and I think when you play the game, you realize that, or you will find as well that the development team picked the best approach to do this.”</p> <p>For years, the industry has been obsessed with open-world design. People want more freedom, more hours, more map. But the notion that <em>Requiem </em>might be an open-world game didn’t sit well with <em>Resident Evil</em> players who love the series’ linear, tightly controlled storylines. The horror of <em>Resident Evil</em> is informed by its design, and an open world would significantly shift the way players experience it. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u0mgOPbpagc">Footage shown last month of a city street with cars and pedestrians</a> sparked <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GamingLeaksAndRumours/comments/1q5dlc8/resident_evil_requiems_path_tracing_trailer_by/">some of that open-world speculation</a>, which can now be hushed thanks to Nakanishi’s statement to <em>Game Informer</em>. <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/resident-evil-requiem-the-final-preview">In its <em>Requiem</em> preview, <em>IGN </em>said</a> that Grace’s portions of the game should be “familiar to anyone who has played&nbsp;<em>Resident Evil 2</em> or&nbsp;<em>7</em>.” Leon’s sections, meanwhile, “stirred up our muscle memory of playing <em>Resident Evil 4</em>,” <em>IGN</em> said.</p>

 <p><em>Resident Evil Requiem</em>, the ninth mainline game in the franchise, will be released on February 27. Capcom’s last <em>Resident Evil</em> Game, <em>Resident Evil Village</em>, was released in 2021.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Mining Crystals In Highguard Is So Damn Satisfying]]></title>

              <p>Shooting guns in <em>Highguard</em> is fun and feels very good. But the most satisfying thing to do in the newly released free-to-play raid shooter doesn’t involve guns. Instead, it happens whenever I get a chance to smash some crystals using a minigame that rewards perfection in a smart way.</p> <p>In <em>Highguard</em>, which is out now on PC, PS5, and Xbox, you have the chance to visit shops during your match to buy shields, guns, ammo, upgrades, and other gear. But nothing in this world is free. Well, I guess <em>Highguard</em> is free, but whatever, my point is that you need some cash to buy this stuff. Actually, not cash but blue crystals. Bits of blue crystals, to be more precise. You get some from killing enemies and raiding or defending bases, but a fast and efficient way to get a lot of crystal shards is to mine the large deposits that litter the map. And mining these larger veins of crystal is satisfying.</p>

 <p>On PS5, you click the right stick to begin a simple timing minigame that lets you quickly smash through a big crystal deposit with a satisfying series of sounds and a big crushing blow at the end. Every time I do this perfectly, I feel good. I love it. I sometimes take a moment to break a few more crystals, even if I don’t really need to, because smashing them perfectly is such a joy. I may at one point have been caught off-guard and quickly killed by two enemy players because I was distracted while mining crystals. Awkward.</p> <figure id="attachment_2000663552" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000663552"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000663552">©Wlidlight / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p>What really helps make this process feel good, besides the wonderful “<em>dink, dink, crash</em>” noises and timing minigame, is that when you perfectly nail it, the game gives you a reward: The next crystal you mine will break instantly. Oh, buddy, you better believe that feels good.</p>

 <p>Now, I would like to point out that I actually have to go mine for crystals during the middle of a long match so I can buy some shields, which isn’t my favorite part of <em>Highguard</em>. In fact, a lot of the economy around mining crystals and spending them likely needs to be tweaked to make it less annoying early on and less of a pain in the later part of a long round. But that doesn’t change the fact that the actual act of mining in <em>Highguard</em> makes me feel good. I love it. They should add a mode all about harvesting crystal shards and taking them back to your base, and whichever team has the most after five minutes wins. I’d play the heck out of that.</p>
